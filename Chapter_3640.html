  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3640 Robber </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng originally made the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his feet fly close to the ground. But after grabbing the third one, he had risen to a higher altitude.</p>

  <p>Sinclair and Jago controlled the other two.</p>

  <p>While Jago had a rather low cultivation level, he was superior to Sinclair when it came to controlling the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>Upon Qiu Yinhe's reminder, everyone on the Lofty Swords turned to the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Pearce's pupils contracted until a triangular mirror appeared in their depths.</p>

  <p id="top_18">Even if the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were over a hundred miles away, he could see every detail on them as clear as day.</p>

  <p>His wrinkled face was dumbfounded at what he saw.</p>

  <p>And he wasn't the only one stunned frozen.</p>

  <p>Auden was struck with astonishment when he saw Luo Zheng flying atop the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow as it spat out blue flames.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Qiu Yinhe, Goran, and the rest used their own methods to observe? some used their spiritual senses, while others used their eyesight, but all of them wore bewildered expressions.</p>

  <p>The sight had them shocked, speechless, and confused.</p>

  <p>"Those three men snatched away the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu?" Eventually, Pearce couldn't stop himself from asking.</p>

  <p>"It seems so." Goran nodded.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were nurtured by Emperor Di Jun with great effort. How could he have the qualifications to attack the North Unicorn Province if they could be taken away so easily?" said one of the Taiyi Governors, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Even if he had seen it with his own two eyes, he couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>If the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu could be snatched away so easily, Emperor Di Jun had no power to fight with the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>He must have set many restrictions on the powerful puppets.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Sinclair were merely Taiyi Generals.</p>

  <p>Even if Eastern Emperor Taiyi came in person, he could only crush the crows to dust? he wouldn't have been able to snatch them away.</p>

  <p>"Who took the three crows? Was it Sinclair?" asked another Taiyi Governor.</p>

  <p>Among the Taiyi Generals, Sinclair was considered a veteran. If he further improved his strength, he'd easily gain the qualifications to become a Taiyi Governor. Because of the fact, most of them thought it was him doing the miracle.</p>

  <p>"It must be Luo Zheng," Qiu Yinhe said with a smile? it seemed he had put aside all his previous worries.</p>

  <p>"I think so, too," Goran said, nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>Doing such a thing was not a matter of strength.</p>

  <p>Even Qiu Yinhe himself couldn't do it. Besides, Qiu Yinhe and Goran were well aware that Luo Zheng was much stronger than Sinclair.</p>

  <p>All the while, Pearce remained silent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a glimmer of hope sparked in his heart? he was hoping Luo Zheng and the two could beak the current deadlock.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that Luo Zheng was controlling suddenly flew up at high speed.</p>

  <p>His body was nearly completely vertical.</p>

  <p>Initially, he had planned to use the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow to kill more of the ordinary ones, but the Jin Wu came at him overwhelmingly? there was no way to kill them all.</p>

  <p>What turned out most crucial, though, was that they were attacking the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>In this war with the Jin Wu, Luo Zheng wasn't a key figure, nor did he know much about the plans set by the Taiyi Heaven Palace's senior leaders.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that if the Sky Net was broken, the situation would turn out much worse.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Di Jun, you can control the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu without touching them. Am I right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Before he could snatch the first two crows, he had to get close enough to them. When he tried to snatch the third, the demon woman from the Divine Lair was thrown right off by the crow, letting Emperor Di Jun control it from far away.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Emperor Di Jun. "But the premise is that there are no demon women from the Divine Lair on the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was overjoyed to hear the fact. "Can you control the ones above?"</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were flying above, but only twenty of them had demon women riding on their backs.</p>

  <p>If they managed to get all the crows, even a typically calm man like Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to hide his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Of course, get closer," Emperor Di Jun said plainly in return.</p>

  <p>In truth, Emperor Di Jun was rather disappointed in the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Everything they were doing went against his original goal of sowing the seeds.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From beneath Luo Zheng's feet, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow suddenly quickened and dashed upward.</p>

  <p>Phoenix sat on the back of the topmost Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. She stared blankly ahead, expecting the Taiyi Heaven Palace people to rush out upon their arrival. She figured they wouldn't bear to watch the Sky Net collapse.</p>

  <p>The interesting part of the show was yet to come, and Phoenix was looking forward to watching the restless, helpless expressions of the people there.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, she suddenly felt something quickly approaching. She looked down to find a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>"Are they back?"</p>

  <p>When the general offensive was launched, Queenie had led another two women to capture the Mountain Sea Pass. It was about time they returned.</p>

  <p>But why was the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flying at such a high speed?</p>

  <p>A strange feeling of anger rose within Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to scold the one on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, her beautiful eyes suddenly began trembling as she saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was already very familiar with this man.</p>

  <p>In their first encounter, she had failed to kill him.</p>

  <p>In their second encounter in the Chaotic Source World, she had almost lost all the demon women because of him.</p>

  <p>In their third encounter on the Other Shore, her loss was even more miserable? she had to give up Stage Fourteen to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, he even managed to snatch the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's innocent face terrified Phoenix. His calm demeanor was more like the calm before a storm? it was like a nightmare to Phoenix as she felt all her power shrink to nothing. The man who was supposed to be not worth even mentioning could crush her to death effortlessly.</p>

  <p>"Master Phoenix!"</p>

  <p>"Master Phoenix, how did a human snatch the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow?"</p>

  <p>"He's approaching with one!"</p>

  <p>Many of the demon women riding the crows had also noticed Luo Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>"All of you, go catch him!" Phoenix ordered urgently, gritting her teeth.</p>

  <p>If it was anyone else, she would've killed him immediately.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was important? he had to be caught alive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The demon women then dashed downward.</p>

  <p>In the distance, Qiu Yinhe, Pearce, and the rest closely watched the front.</p>

  <p>Seeing the demon women descend one after another, Qiu Yinhe couldn't help but say, "It's too dangerous. What does Luo Zheng want to do?"</p>

  <p>"Should we do something?" Goran asked.</p>

  <p>But Pearce reached out his hand to stop him.</p>

  <p>Although he was also worried, he had the instinct to take the risks. "Hold on! He must be rushing up like this for a reason!"</p>
