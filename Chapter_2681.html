  <p>
</p>

  <p>The normally tranquil sky was now littered with dozens of streams of life vitality that quietly fluctuated.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the consummate True Gods who hovered around Luo Zheng conversed with each other through life vitality.</p>

  <p>"What are we waiting for? We're only twenty thousand miles away from the Snake Spirit Region!"</p>

  <p>"At his current speed, there's no doubt he'd be able to enter the Snake Spirit Region in five minutes. I'm afraid he would've escaped by then!"</p>

  <p>"What are you worried about, Rachelle? There are so many of us fighting together. Even a Demi-holy Being cannot defeat us!"</p>

  <p>Now, these consummate True Gods were really confused.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng might have a certain reputation, but he had just stepped into the consummation of True God Realm. Thus, why did both Rachelle and Shahn ask them to surround Luo Zheng and be on standby? Why were they worried if their opponent was a new consummate True God?</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the consummate True Gods from the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands regarded Troy as their leader.</p>

  <p>If Troy wasn't present, they listened to Rachelle's command. They had always done so when they explored the forbidden lands over the past years.</p>

  <p>Currently, however, those consummate True Gods began to doubt Rachelle's strategy.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to say it again?" Rachelle said icily. Her lips pressed into a thin line as she said, "Diego and Bryan joined forces to fight Luo Zheng, but the brat had killed them in the first round! If you want to die, then I won't stop you!"</p>

  <p>Some of the consummate True Gods did not know that, and their mouths dropped at her words.</p>

  <p>They glanced at Luo Zheng again, and subconsciously acted more cautiously.</p>

  <p>Of course, Diego and Bryan certainly weren't weak among their peers.</p>

  <p>Moreover, most of the other consummate True Gods present weren't even confident enough to win against them. If so, how did Luo Zheng kill them so easily in one round?</p>

  <p>They wouldn't have believed it if Rachelle hadn't personally said it.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other consummate True Gods, Rachelle was more eager to kill Luo Zheng and she knew him better.</p>

  <p>And, it was precisely because of that reason that she could restrain herself from doing so.</p>

  <p>She had once missed the chance to kill him before and it made her depressed, but this time, she wanted to make sure that she would succeed.</p>

  <p>"But we can't just watch him escape, right?" one consummate True God said with dissatisfaction. "Troy has entered the Sea Vessel Region.</p>

  <p>Let's wait for him to decide," Rachelle answered coldly.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Holy Beings from the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands considered Nicholas as the absolute ruler.</p>

  <p>For the consummate True Gods, Troy played a similar role.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, who wasn't fully assured that she could defeat Luo Zheng, pinned all her hopes on Troy.</p>

  <p>The slight fluctuations of life vitality that surrounded Luo Zheng continued to exchange information.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng couldn't know the content of their conversations, his lips tugged into a slight sneer.</p>

  <p>'Maybe these guys are discussing how to deal with me?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Right now, he had no other choice but to fight for his life.</p>

  <p>It was also Emily's fault as she showed off her abilities and insisted on creating a space channel from the top of the divine land. Had she picked a different place, then he wouldn't have encountered so much trouble.</p>

  <p>Just as he slipped further into his thoughts, his eyes lit up when he saw a tinge of light green appear in the distance. The seemingly endless coastline now came to an end!</p>

  <p>"There's the junction of the three regions. The Square Sky Region and the Sea Vessel Region have been sealed. Maybe there's a way out in the third region!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>With that, the wings on his back immediately flapped and his speed increased some more.</p>

  <p>Just as he had sped up, several small black dots suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The small black dots traveled towards him at an extremely fast pace!</p>

  <p>"Several more consummate True Gods..." It wasn't long before he saw the face of the man who was at their helm, and he quickly frowned.</p>

  <p>"Troy?"</p>

  <p>In turn, Troy just smirked and said, "Back then, I had given you a chance to stay alive a bit longer. I didn't expect that you would step into the consummation of True God Realm from a low-rank True God in just ten years! You must've had many lucky chances during those years. You are indeed, a very fortunate person! But do you think you still have any luck to escape from me this time?"</p>

  <p>There was still a distance of a few hundred miles between the two of them, but Luo Zheng already heard Troy's deep voice clearly.</p>

  <p>His iron hand glinted in the light with a silver sheen, then streams of a strange kind of power circled around it.</p>

  <p>"You can try to know if I still have luck," Luo Zheng said faintly. Then, he moved like a lightning bolt. He was careful to maintain his immensely fast speed as he planned to force himself through.</p>

  <p>Just as he was done speaking, his gaze fell on the people behind Troy.</p>

  <p>His heart pounded. There in the group, was Tianming!</p>

  <p>Behind Troy, Tianming was also very confused.</p>

  <p>He never expected that all this time, these consummate True Gods of the alliance of the powerful clans had been all out just to capture Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Back then after he had entered the Floating Island, he had also secretly investigated the whereabouts of the other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>There were no news about the other Godly Geniuses except for Luo Zheng, who had gotten quite a reputation on the Floating Islands. His stories could be heard everywhere.</p>

  <p>When he only had the cultivation of a proving godly warrior, he had winning streaks in the battles against warriors of higher levels. Then, he had kidnapped several consummate True Gods in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, and finally escaped with the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan...</p>

  <p>The rumors about Luo Zheng also made him speechless.</p>

  <p>Those rumors, however, had ceased ten years ago. Ever since then, he had gotten nothing else about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had been a little worried. Could it be that Luo Zheng had already died somewhere? Now they were here, he had never thought that he would meet Luo Zheng in such a situation. Luo Zheng was the target they wanted to arrest!</p>

  <p>Worry flooded his face. How would Luo Zheng escape under such a predicament?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he couldn't help Luo Zheng with everyone watching. After all, he had worked so hard to enter the Dongfang Clan and through the years of his management, he had also gained Nicholas' trust. He had a more important task to complete.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Luo Zheng was getting increasingly closer to Troy, he felt even more conflicted. Yet, his face looked as calm as water. No one could even notice that something bothered him.</p>

  <p>While Rachelle also got closer to Luo Zheng, streams of violent aura spread from the blood red short swords in her hands, and half of the sky was painted a bright, bloody crimson.</p>

  <p>As for Shahn, a sharp sword light appeared in his hand, which constantly swallowed and spat around the tip of his sword.</p>

  <p>Walton looked absolutely murderous as his body unleashed a powerful aura, the sword shield hoisted on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>All the consummate True Gods who surrounded Luo Zheng secretly gathered their momentum and waited.</p>

  <p>?</p>

  <p>"Attack!" Troy ordered.</p>

  <p>Ribbons of highly powerful forces of Divine Dao suddenly erupted.</p>

  <p>"Divine Five Elements Body!"</p>

  <p>"Wind Ruin!"</p>

  <p>"Sky Bury!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Every single one of the consummate True Gods executed the Divine Dao they had comprehended to their fullest extent.</p>

  <p>Any token at the consummation level could have the power to destroy the heaven and earth when it was performed alone. What more if twenty or so consummate True Gods exhibited their theurgies, all at the same time?</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>In a split second, all the theurgies rushed simultaneously towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The effect of the combined theurgies formed a blinding, massive energy flow that covered an expanse of a hundred thousand feet around Luo Zheng's whole body.</p>

  <p>All the creatures within the hundred thousand-foot radius, even those with the cultivation of Demi-holy Beings, would barely survive.</p>

  <p>The shockwave from the energy flow alone had drained the sea water within an area of ten thousand miles. In the Square Sky Region, the mountains that stretched thousands of miles had been shaking violently.</p>
