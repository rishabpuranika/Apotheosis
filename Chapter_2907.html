<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2907 The Confrontation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the warriors remained confused as to why they couldn't attack Tianming, the sword in Tianming's hand turned into a ray of light that headed straight for the three Demi-holy Beings in the front.</p>

  <p>These were highly experienced Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Although Tianming's power took them by surprise, they all managed to react quickly.</p>

  <p>"Gentle Wind Twining!"</p>

  <p>From the body of a Demi-holy Being emerged a gently breeze.</p>

  <p id="top_5">Although harmless at first, countless thin gusts began to quickly coil like invisible ropes around Tianming's Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>"The breeze..."</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes widened. Despite the sharpness of his sword, it failed to inflict damage on the unshapely breeze.</p>

  <p>"I've stopped him!" the Demi-holy Being bellowed.</p>

  <p>"We must trap him before he can make another move!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this, other Demi-holy Beings followed suit.</p>

  <p>The burning flames evolved into long threads that headed straight for Tianming. Not long after, the Life Divine Dao morphed into vines that ensnared him.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes slightly narrowed as he looked at these wise individuals.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a consummate True God. He would've been unable to deal with several Demi-holy Beings if he hadn't gone to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, he was different now.</p>

  <p>Before the Demi-holy Beings' attacks could reach him, tiny ice flowers appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Once the threads of flames reached the ice flowers, the flames immediately disappeared and were replaced by ice.</p>

  <p>The vines headed towards Tianming turned to ice as well.</p>

  <p>The chilly air that ran along the vines turned the fierce flames into frosty ice flowers.</p>

  <p>Even the gentle breezes couldn't escape being turned into ice? their outlines now visible due to the ice flowers floating in the air.</p>

  <p>"What energy is this?"</p>

  <p>"Is this the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! The Mysterious Ice Divine Dao isn't that frightening. Back off!"</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings looked terrified.</p>

  <p>Although a warning was sent out, Tianming's ice flowers were too fast. The three Demi-holy Beings that tried to trap Tianming had no time to retreat and were quickly attacked by the ice flowers.</p>

  <p>Before any of them could respond, they were turned into ice sculptures? the look of shock so vivid on their frozen faces.</p>

  <p>If the Demi-holy Beings met the same frozen fate at the hands of the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao, they could break out of it. Tianming's ice flowers, however, weren't ordinary for if they made contact with the Demi-holy Beings, then the life would be instantly sucked out of them.</p>

  <p>The crowd that wanted to fight Tianming stopped immediately.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were excited to challenge Tianming. Now, they looked at him with horror as if staring at a fiend.</p>

  <p>With his sword in one hand, he gently raised the other to swirl a tiny ice flower. He then said, "I wonder if I have the qualifications to spare your lives."</p>

  <p>No one spoke. They continued to stare at the ice flower in his hand. Never before had they witnessed a method such as this.</p>

  <p>Even those who practiced the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao to the consummation couldn't hold a candle to Tianming in terms of playing with ice.</p>

  <p>They realized that they were no match for Tianming. If they made the rash decision to rush forward, they would die.</p>

  <p>Alfredo and the others from the large clans on the Floating Islands were smart enough to not make a move. A serious look was plastered on all their faces.</p>

  <p>'This guy's power is quite intimidating. I wonder if Luo Zheng is stronger than him, ' Alfredo thought to himself as he looked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood quietly behind Tianming and Sword Chen. It appeared that he didn't intend on moving one inch.</p>

  <p>Just as the two sides were about to reach a standstill, a terrifying aura suddenly burst from the valley depths as if millions of beasts were emerging out of the earth. A stench followed it and made everyone's head turn towards the source, hoping to suppress their fear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone focused on the streak of black light that appeared.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a black spear that headed quickly for Tianming.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed at the sight of the spear. He ordered, "Tianming, retreat!"</p>

  <p>Tianming also sensed the black spear's power. With a light tap of his toes, he withdrew.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The black spear pierced the exact spot where Tianming was standing earlier.</p>

  <p>The spear was completely transformed by the Abyss Demon Region's energy, melting like a black candle upon piercing the ground. The resulting black puddle on the ground had wispy black auras that soared towards the sky with their faint miserable screams. The area had become purgatory.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a figure floated over from the valley.</p>

  <p>It was a man with a pair of black wings on his back and a blood-red, gourd-shaped pendant on his chest. A hostile look was plastered over his normally handsome face.</p>

  <p>"It's Pascal!"</p>

  <p>"What's he doing here?"</p>

  <p>"What is that power? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Whether it was Tianming's ice flowers or Pascal's black spear, neither of them could be controlled by normal consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Not even Holy Beings were that strong.</p>

  <p>This battle would be beyond their control? like a confrontation between two immortals.</p>

  <p>Pascal flew over and gazed at Luo Zheng before addressing him. "Even the Yellow Emperor Guards couldn't stop you from entering the Mountain of Holy Beings. Mike is really hard to deal with. However, it's such a shame that all of you will have to die here today."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at Pascal and retorted with a smile, "Whether we die today or not isn't for you to decide. That will be answered when we're done fighting. But before that, I'll have to admit that I do feel sorry for you? being turned into a puppet by your father and all."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, all the bystanders looked at each other in shock and confusion.</p>

  <p>"Pascal? A...puppet?"</p>

  <p>"By his...father?"</p>

  <p>Alfredo's brows furrowed and then raised abruptly.</p>

  <p>He was already aware of the changes that Pascal, Liusu, and Aleyna had undergone even before entering the Abyss Demon Region. What he wasn't aware of was how cruel Samuel could be to do such a thing to his children.</p>

  <p>Pascal? or rather, Samuel in Pascal's body? was clearly irritated with the fact that Luo Zheng had exposed him in front of all those witnesses.</p>

  <p>Just as Pascal was about to attack, Luo Zheng revealed, "I've restored Liusu's and Aleyna's memories. They're both disappointed in you, Aleyna especially. She never thought her own father would be capable of such cruelty."</p>

  <p>Even when the two girls stayed within the Immortal Mansion, Luo Zheng could sense that they still had certain feelings toward the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Their father's poor treatment of them was unacceptable.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Pascal interrupted him.</p>

  <p>A fierce light shot out of his eyes and his black wings trembled as he began charging towards Luo Zheng.</p>
