<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng withdrew his perception from the book, he discovered that Ning Yudie, Mu Ning and Mu Ning had also released their perceptions into the book under the old man's guidance. They were standing blankly by the side of the book. This meant that right now, they should be wandering within the Chaotic Storm Chronicle.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the three women also withdrew themselves from the book; their eyes filled with endless shock. They had seen the same things he had.</p>

  <p>In fact, they were also unable to understand the book. They knew what it said, but what it implied was far beyond them. The world that the book depicted had shocked them greatly. They couldn't help but wonder just how powerful the writer of the book was.</p>

  <p>When Immortal Book saw their expressions, he looked extremely satisfied, as if that was exactly what he wanted. As the person in charge of the library, he had scrolled through almost all of the books in the library, and it was said that he found an endless amount of joy in sharing them with anyone who came this way. In these long years, he had roamed the ocean of books and had seen many profound secrets. He wanted to share his thoughts with others, but there was no one that he could communicate with. It was indeed a pity.</p>

  <p>Of course he knew that the people in front of him were completely shocked by the primal chaos, and he felt extremely happy in his heart.</p>

  <p>He then told them, "The Chaotic Storm Chronicle is just a drop in the bucket when you are in this library. The things left behind by our master are all treasures and extremely valuable ones. If you want to read these books one by one, you will need many years to finish reading them all.</p>

  <p>Come on! I'll recommend a few more to you guys."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were looking forward to it. However, Mu Ning pursed her lips and pouted, "That was just a hazy world. It was boring. I guess whatever you recommend will be boring as well."</p>

  <p>"What?" Hearing Mu Ning say that, Immortal Book was unhappy. It was as if she had treated the most important thing in his eyes as rubbish. This was something he could not tolerate, so he spat out, "Young girl, what nonsense are you talking about? The books in this library are as numerous as the stars in the sky, and there will always be books that are suitable for you. What kind of book do you like? I will find it for you!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had just flipped through the Chaotic Storm Chronicle.</p>

  <p>Although she was also incomparably shocked, she didn't like such kind of book. Now that Immortal Book wanted to recommend a book to her, she smiled cunningly and remarked, "I'm afraid that there is not a single book that I would like in here."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Immortal Book snorted and pulled a long face. "That can't be true. You name it, and I will have it. If I can't find a book you like, then I won't be worthy of the title of Immortal Book."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Immortal Book did not look happy, Luo Luo Zheng also told Mu Ning,</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, don't speak carelessly."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Immortal Book told Luo Luo Zheng, "Don't worry. I don't mind. I'm not angry; I'm just not convinced. Girl, just tell me!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning blinked a few times before opening her mouth and saying something no one had expected. "I like reading love stories. I presume this place doesn't have that kind of book."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the other two women were rendered speechless. Luo Luo Zheng could only shake his head with a bitter smile. As for Ning Yudie, her face was expressionless as she had already guessed that Mu Ning would come up with some strange request. Mu Ning, however, covered her mouth and giggled. 'This woman really is a hopeless romantic!' she thought.</p>

  <p>In the Ethereal City, where Mu Ning had lived all her life, there were numerous scholars. Some of them would often write novels when they were free. Even though these novels were not considered as a refined art, they circulated among the women of the society for their romantic aspect.</p>

  <p>When she was at the Xi Clan's house, Mu Ning would often send her servant to buy some novels for entertainment when she had nothing better to do. That was just one of the many things she did to pass her time since she was totally not interested in cultivation.</p>

  <p>As for Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, one was the leader of the Cloud Hall itself, and the other was a master from the Cloud Sect. Normally, they were busy with cultivation and business, so how would they find the time to read novels or love stories?</p>

  <p>Hearing Xi Youqin's request, Immortal Book was also stunned. Then, he raised his head and laughed, saying, "Girl, come with me!"</p>

  <p>"There really is one?" Mu Ning asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book didn't answer her question. He only brought her to a bookshelf towards their left. With a gentle wave of his finger, a huge book slowly fell down from the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up at Immortal Book's ability. This book had been brought by Immortal Book himself without any effort at all. Clearly, its weight, just like the previous one, was equivalent to a mountain range, yet Immortal Book had taken it down so easily. Terrifying strength was revealed everywhere in this Immortal Mansion. Even a person in charge of the library had the sort of strength that Luo Luo Zheng could not even imagine.</p>

  <p>Under the guidance of Immortal Book, Mu Ning stood in front of the book and quickly immersed her perception into it.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, they were curious as to what sort of love story the Immortal Mansion might hold, so they also followed her into the world inside the book.</p>

  <p>After a long while, everyone left the book.</p>

  <p>By that time, Mu Ning was already in tears. Her nose was sniffling and her eyes were in a daze as if she were still immersed in the story. The story seemed to be a sad one.</p>

  <p>Aura's expression also revealed sadness. She was also moved by the story that was written in the book.</p>

  <p>Even Ning Yudie was lost in thought. In the past, she had always buried herself in cultivation, and had never come across such a romantic story before. So the impact on her should have been the greatest. However, her warrior spirit was firm, and although she was moved by the tragedy that lay within the book, she was able to control herself, unlike Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, his face was filled with helplessness. He was completely confused by what was going on and wasn't moved by the story at all. If Mu Ning were still in her senses, she would say that this guy was hopeless.</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning sobbed, she actually threw herself into Luo Zheng's arms. "Oh Luo Luo Zheng! The woman in this book has such a tragic story. I don't want to read any more of these stories in the future."</p>

  <p>"Girl, do you still want to see more of these kinds of stories?" Immortal Book revealed a complacent expression.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning wiped her tears away and asked in surprise, "Are there more of these?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was once again left speechless when he saw Xi Youqin's reaction. He would have thought that she wouldn't want to see anymore.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book had chosen a few more books for Mu Ning, and she was immersed in one of those. Then Luo Luo Zheng asked, "Immortal Book, are there any books about cultivation methods in the library?"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book laughed and said, "Of course there are. The library contains books about a myriad of things. How could it not have some about cultivation methods? Come with me!"</p>

  <p>After saying that, Immortal Book rode on a cloud and brought Luo Luo Zheng and the remaining two women deeper into the library. Saul also followed behind.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng was going to let her cry for a while.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had mentioned cultivation methods, Yudie's and Aura's eyes had lit up.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie knew that the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess she had cultivated was only an incomplete one and that she needed to practice a lot more.</p>

  <p>Although she wanted to follow in Luo Zheng's footsteps in terms of cultivation and strength, it looked like the gap between them was widening day by day. If she could find a suitable cultivation method in this library, she would be more than willing to obtain it and get closer to her husband. In reality, she had thought about the future that she and Luo Luo Zheng had, much more than Mu Ning had done. It was not until the old man had reminded Mu Ning about her powers that she then realized that Luo Luo Zheng would ascend to the Upper World. But Ning Yudie had long known about this and was getting ready to follow him. If she couldn't keep up with his pace, she would be left alone in the Lower World in the future. Of course, she wasn't willing for that to happen. This library was definitely an opportunity for her and she wouldn't miss it.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, she was not as far-sighted as Ning Yudie was. However, she only had one thought in her heart. She did not want to catch up to Luo Zheng's level of cultivation, but only wanted to be able to follow him.</p>

  <p>The library was surprisingly large and could almost be considered bigger on the inside. Each bookshelf was equivalent to a mountain. They weaved through the bookshelves, as if strolling inside a valley. As they walked, Immortal Book told them, "These books were also written by our master.</p>

  <p>These are travel notes.</p>

  <p>These are verses and ditties.</p>

  <p>These are odes and songs.</p>

  <p>These are..."</p>

  <p>After a long while, Immortal Book stopped in his tracks and said, "These are the cultivation methods which were created by our master. All of the cultivation methods in this row are suitable for women."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed at the words of Immortal Book. He then asked, "I wonder if there is any Transcendent Divine Might among these cultivation methods?"</p>
