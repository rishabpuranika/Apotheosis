<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 580 The Flood Dragon Spirit (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Given the current situation, all the disciples were desperately trying to get out of the abyss. So consumed were they about their safety that they didn't worry about how the others were doing.</p>

  <p>Tianming jumped quickly from one floating rock to another higher floating rock using his Sword Steps. When he encountered tiny floating stones, he would crush them with his sword intent.</p>

  <p>As he was nearing a safe distance, Tianming turned to check if his companions were all right. The color drained from his face when Tianming saw that Luo Zheng was falling toward the flood dragon.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" he exclaimed in horror.</p>

  <p>Tianming's scream attracted the attention of others who were struggling to climb up. They swiveled to see what had happened. Astonishment reflected on their faces when they saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Frank noticed that the disciple from Cloud Hall was pulling Luo Zheng toward the mouth of the flood dragon, a cold sneer appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He had long felt that something was suspicious about the Cloud Hall's disciple. He had even considered the possibility that the disciple was plotting something sinister! As the Cloud Hall's disciple had not done anything unusual and evil, Frank didn't bother to figure out what he was plotting.</p>

  <p>He had certainly not expected the disciple to become crazy and drag Luo Zheng to the flood dragon's mouth!</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng, you deserve it! Yet, you still have so much Dark Devil Phantom essence. If you die in the abyss, I'm afraid I won't be able to get it. What a great pity that is!</p>

  <p>Never mind! You are so powerful despite being at the nature level. If in the future, you become an elite disciple of the Cloud Hall, you may be one of my greatest enemies!' Thousands of thoughts were running through Frank's mind when he saw the danger Luo Zheng was in. Frank, no matter how overconfident he was, had to face these facts.</p>

  <p>'In that case, the belly of the flood dragon is a good place for your grave.'</p>

  <p>Frank smiled at the thought.</p>

  <p>As he climbed up, a wide smirk replaced Frank's disgruntled expression.</p>

  <p>He had been dissatisfied with the earlier distribution of the Dark Devil Phantom essence. But now, the thought of Luo Zheng dying pleased him, much like that a warm, spring wind was stroking on his face.</p>

  <p>Frank did know that he had missed a rather rare chance. If Luo Zheng hadn't shown up, this big opportunity would have been his. Unfortunately, Zheng's presence changed Frank's destiny forever.</p>

  <p>To some extent, Frank suffered a significant loss because he was not strong and lucky enough! And since Luo Zheng was much stronger and luckier, he was in a position to rob Frank of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming and Patrick were in a bleak mood. They had faced the trials of Cloud Road with Luo Zheng. It had never occurred to them that Luo Zheng would die here...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the disciple from Cloud Hall grabbing him as they plummeted toward the flood dragon. Now that the disciple had come closer, Luo Zheng wrinkled his nose as a familiar scent enveloped him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng seemed to recall that the Cloud Hall's disciple walked awkwardly. Somehow, the disciple's gait seemed rather feminine.</p>

  <p>Thinking of that and the disciple's strange and charming smile along with the familiar fragrance...</p>

  <p>'That's right! The Cloud Hall's disciple is a woman!' Luo Zheng concluded.</p>

  <p>However, at this point, such a conclusion was useless to him. Even though he had figured out that the disciple was a woman, what could he do to her?</p>

  <p>The colossal flood dragon was at the bottom of the abyss. Since Luo Zheng and the disciple were hurtling toward it, the flood dragon kept its mouth open in preparation to swallow them. To Luo Zheng, being swallowed alive was a worse fate than falling into the abyss.</p>

  <p>"Why... Why did you have to drag me down?" asked Luo Zheng nervously as they fell further into the abyss.</p>

  <p>The disciple smiled. Her smile confirmed Zheng's earlier suspicions.</p>

  <p>Indeed, this disciple was a woman disguised as a man! "Because I chose you!" Her voice was as soft and gentle as a summer breeze.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Luo Zheng asked. Unable to understand her cryptic message, bewilderment reflected in his eyes. Luo Zheng thought it was a waste of time trying to decipher her puzzling answer when all they had were a few precious moments before they died. 'I do not know her at all, so there can't be any bad history between us. Why choose me? Why did she pick me to die with her?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>The disciple from Cloud Hall said no more. Instead, she pushed Luo Zheng under her as they tumbled toward the flood dragon.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon sensed that they were close enough, so it opened its mouth suddenly and swallowed them in one giant gulp.</p>

  <p>As soon as the flood dragon closed its mouth, darkness engulfed Luo Zheng and the disciple. Subconsciously, Luo Zheng clung to the disciple from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Together, they crashed and tumbled down the insides of the flood dragon. The continuous rolling movement made them dizzy and disoriented.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the insides of the flood dragon were soft. As such, Luo Zheng and the disciple suffered no injuries from the impact of the fall and the subsequent tumbles. After a while, Luo Zheng and the disciple's momentum slowed down before they finally came to a stop. Zheng's shoulder collided with something soft.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pressed the soft object with his hand and said in a relieved tone,</p>

  <p>"Well, luckily, the inside parts of the flood dragon are soft. Otherwise, we would have suffered severe injuries from our fall."</p>

  <p>"Remove your hand!" screeched the disciple.</p>

  <p>At once, Luo Zheng felt his arm being grabbed and twisted before he felt himself being thrown away.</p>

  <p>It was not until Luo Zheng landed on another spot that he realized that he hadn't been touching a part of the flood dragon but her breast instead�</p>

  <p>"You're not pretending anymore? Why do you dress like a man?" asked Luo Zheng as he glared in the disciple's direction even though it was dark.</p>

  <p>"Hum!" the disciple from Cloud Hall snorted coldly. Then a dim light appeared in her hand� illuminating the surroundings at once.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, she didn't feel the need to hide her identity anymore.</p>

  <p>Thus, she removed her facial disguise and showed her true self.</p>

  <p>In the faint light, still dressed in the white robe specially made for Cloud Hall's disciples, the woman appeared almost angelic. Her loose robe did little to hide her well-shaped figure. Her dark hair was casually placed on her left shoulder. Luo Zheng admired how natural and attractive she appeared.</p>

  <p>Even though the light was dim, he could still see her fair skin and beautiful features. She looked gorgeous, even though she was not wearing any make-up or jewelry. Luo Zheng was stunned for a while.</p>
