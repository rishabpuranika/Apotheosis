  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the majority of people, the nine lines of the Sea of Truth proved to be enormous trials.</p>

  <p>Those select few with enough skill and expertise were the only ones able to traverse them in a single expedition. For this matter, the disciples of the great forces were provided with soul pills and soul weapons. As a result, they came prepared for the first line challenge.</p>

  <p>However, a majority of the challengers slowly wandered around the first line. Their souls needed to endure the trial of the wind first and acclimatize to it. It was because the Sea of Truth was known for its frigid temperature.</p>

  <p>Having done that, they cautiously approached the first line.</p>

  <p>Elvis Cao was in a good mood. He happily hummed a tune while navigating the sea on his Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>In the northern region of the Pastoral Continent, many forces finally offered their assistance. Because of this, more than ten warriors had triumphantly achieved the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Elvis knew that he almost had no prospect of winning if he tried to travel the Sea of Truth alone. Hence, he needed over ten people who were willing to participate in this quest. With this number, they could probably rival the disciples of the great forces.</p>

  <p>For him, this was an incredibly good chance to rob others.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the Pastoral Continent was not considered great. As a matter of fact, it was almost insignificant. Its northern region was dreadfully bleak and deserted.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there was an exceptionally powerful Other Shore Realm warrior who appeared in the northern region of the Pastoral Continent. In the middle of the continent's largest mountain, the warrior left a Heavenly Space Inscription.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Space Inscription greatly helped people who wished to learn and develop the Truth of Void Destruction. They found that it became a whole lot easier to master it as they stood under the inscription. Therefore, the Heavenly Space Inscription enabled most of the warriors of the Pastoral Continent to step into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The Cao Clan was one of the biggest clans living in the northern region of the Pastoral Continent. Elvis Cao was only able to procure two soul pills from the clan before he stepped into the Sea of Truth. He was one of the lucky few for some of the people who came with him did not even have one soul pill.</p>

  <p>Among all of the people who joined this quest, Elvis was undoubtedly the best of them. It was only natural that he became their leader.</p>

  <p>More than ten warriors usually banded together to plunder soul pills from those who journeyed through the sea alone.</p>

  <p>The soul-level competition barely expended any energy from them. Even a talented member of the elite force would have a difficulty in fending off attacks from more than ten people. Despite what they did, Elvis only ever asked for three soul pills from each of their targets. Almost every single one of those people chose to relinquish their soul pills instead of fighting back.</p>

  <p>Anyway, three soul pills were only a small price to pay to avoid further inconveniences.</p>

  <p>Within a short period of time, Elvis already plundered plenty of soul pills from lone travelers.</p>

  <p>As soon as they gathered an adequate amount of soul pills for all of them, they decided it was time for them to take on the challenge of the first line.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if you have noticed but that woman appears to follow us this entire time, Elvis! Do you think she's planning to retaliate?" the man who stood behind Elvis murmured.</p>

  <p>There was a possibility that in their rage, someone who was robbed brought their comrades with them for revenge. Some of those lone travelers probably belonged to the great forces. It was clear that they had no chance of winning against Elvis and his men if they tried to retaliate on their own.</p>

  <p>Thus, they sought after their comrades who could easily be found around the first line.</p>

  <p>"I am sure she will not attack us. If she is really out for revenge, we can leave the Sea of Truth for a while. These people's time is more important than ours. There is no way they will waste their days just waiting for us to return," Elvis replied nonchalantly. "And haven't you noticed that she is really a very powerful person? I have no idea what kind of soul weapon she possesses but I am sure it will not be difficult for her to overpower all of us."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious? She can take on all of us? That is impossible!" another man exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"For people like her, we are nothing but beggars. A few soul pills wouldn't mean much to her," Elvis answered with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. It is widely known that the northern region of the Pastoral Continent is terribly poor. Unlike other continents, we don't have any great forces we can count on. We only have ourselves," muttered another person.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's only fair that we rob them. They have too much, anyway. When I reach the Other Shore someday, I'll be sure to overcome them all!" Elvis declared callously. A malevolent expression shone in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was proud of his ambition. He knew that he could only advance further as long as he was zealous enough. Elvis desired to turn his ambition into power someday. This power could propel him forward and enable him to reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where the other guy went. It's highly likely he left the Sea of Truth, right?" a member asked.</p>

  <p>"That guy seemed like an incredibly stupid person. I am surprised he was able to enter the Sea of Truth. Fortunately for him, someone covered his share of soul pills," Elvis replied as he waved his hand hastily.</p>

  <p>Anyone who wished to enter the Sea of Truth should know about the importance of soul pills. Those people who traveled the sea and had no idea about them were sure to fail in their attempts.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, man your posts and get ready. We are nearing the first line.</p>

  <p>Approximately ten miles from it, the course of the wind will change and become even stronger..." Elvis ordered his team.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, someone yelled, "Elvis! There seems to be a fish heading towards us!"</p>

  <p>"What did you say? A fish? Are you absolutely sure?" Elvis shouted right back. "There's no doubt the Sea of Truth hosts many creatures. But I am sure the first line is supposedly desolate..." He stopped abruptly in the middle of his sentence. It was because he saw what his man allegedly called fish.</p>

  <p>There was a splashing noise.</p>

  <p>As it came nearer, he realized that it was not a fish at all. It was actually a person. In a blink of an eye, the person leaped from the Sea of Truth and lunged towards their boats!</p>

  <p>Dora was absentmindedly navigating her Truth Boat across the sea. Her mind was still working out the meaning behind what Zheng told her.</p>

  <p>Right after telling her that cryptic message, Zheng just disappeared from her sight. She was completely perplexed about his actions.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's best if I stop here today," she said to herself.</p>

  <p>For Dora, it was not a particularly challenging task to break through the first line at all. Nonetheless, she had no plan on crossing it now.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, she also thought it was pointless to go after Elvis and his group.</p>

  <p>She knew she had more than enough of those soul pills, anyway.</p>

  <p>Silently, she started reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune. She was just about to leave the Sea of Truth when all of a sudden, she saw waves rising steadily from a distance.</p>

  <p>"A fish? Is it really? Hmm... I'm wrong! It's a man!"</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, Dora remembered that particular rumor.</p>

  <p>However, she thought it was absolutely preposterous. To her, it seemed highly unlikely. She would only believe it if she saw it herself.</p>

  <p>This was truly astonishing. It was happening right before her very eyes.</p>

  <p>Someone was actually swimming across the freezing Sea of Truth!</p>

  <p>With this scene unfolding, she immediately stopped reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune. Her eyes blazed with anticipation. She fixed them resolutely at the person swimming from the distance.</p>

  <p>As the man swam effortlessly in the chilling and unfriendly territory, it seemed like he possessed such great power. With every stroke, he launched himself from the surface of the sea and soared about ten feet in the air. After falling back to the sea, he repeated the process with intense speed. It was a remarkably surprising sight to behold for he was more than ten times faster than the Truth Boats!</p>

  <p>"I will definitely follow him when I have the chance. I need to find out how he does that. Grandma will reward me handsomely if I'm able to get this rare piece of information!" Dora's lips twisted into a sly smile.</p>

  <p>Though he could not see their faces, Zheng was able to recognize Elvis and his men quite easily.</p>

  <p>Aside from the fifteen Truth Boats, the Truth of Void Destruction released from them was what gave away their position to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>After two more strokes on the ice-cold water surface, Zheng landed firmly on the red sea in front of Elvis. "Don't waste my time and just surrender all your soul pills to me!" he said ruthlessly.</p>
