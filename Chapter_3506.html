<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was clear that Feng Ge was causing the turmoil of the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>The entrance was filled with energy— it was impossible to head back.</p>

  <p>Inside the channel, the energy became manic. The colorful energy bands rose rapidly, filling every corner of the channel.</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor Feng Ge said a single word to each other before flying forward.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The channel within the energy vortex only grew more and more manic as Feng Ge continued further. The tumultuous energy bands flew around, forming a dense net with Feng Ge and Zheng as its targets.</p>

  <p>By now, Feng Ge felt the panic set in. "What should we do? Can we get out of the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>While the Cloud Flying Wheels could help them fly in the air, their pushing force was lackluster. Even with a corporeal body that was more flexible than a Soul of Light, neither of them could gain any momentum or speed.</p>

  <p>And because corporeal bodies were far heavier than Souls of Light, they looked rather clumsy as they navigated in the air.</p>

  <p>So how could they break through the net formed by the energy bands?</p>

  <p>The net before them was moving closer as the channel behind them continued narrowing.</p>

  <p>At this rate, a maximum of 20 seconds was enough for the vortex to completely eat them up. How could they escape merging with the vortex?</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid," Zheng suddenly said.</p>

  <p>He held up the Cloud Flying Wheel in the opposite direction to retreat to Feng Ge's side and grabbed her arm.</p>

  <p>The act only stunned her— she had no clue what Zheng was planning to do to break the siege under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Just then, she witnessed a flash of lightning on Zheng's back— following the sound of a thunderbolt, a pair of great thunder wings suddenly grew from his back.</p>

  <p>"Thunder Materialization!"</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't use the Shade Stone liquid on the Other Shore, the Godly Way's internal momentum was still available. He could still draw some internal momentum out of his inner world. Back in the Dark Region, he managed to use the Life Godly Way to treat the three-eyed boy, after all.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Zheng quite often used the pair of thunder wings. But because the internal momentum was far weaker than the Other Shore Power in the Source World, Zheng rarely pulled them out.</p>

  <p>But in the most critical moments, the internal momentum could still save him.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A bright light flashed upon both his wings as he dragged Feng Ge through the net like a bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>Seeing that she was fine, Feng Ge went blank before soon understanding what had happened.</p>

  <p>Although both of them were corporeal bodies, they differed in nature.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge obtained a powerful purified being's body when she entered the Other Shore with her Soul of Light, and Zheng entered the Other Shore with his own corporeal body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>As soon as they passed through the energy net, the energy bands before them began intertwining into another net.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng held Feng Ge horizontally— his thunder wings crackled before once again shooting forward like lightning.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>They broke through a net every time he bolted.</p>

  <p>While the entire channel grew manic and the energy bands swept around, Zheng's speed had increased rapidly. He seemed to be passing through the nets before they could even form.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge lay in Zheng's arms peacefully, staring up at him with bright eyes.</p>

  <p>Once Teague's soul was driven away, Feng Ge recovered all the memories about the Dark Region. But she was quite an ignorant child in her memories— she couldn't escape the embarrassment as she browsed through the memories.</p>

  <p>From these memories, she found a unique sense of peace and trust— it should have been the same as what Xun, Nelly and Liusu had felt.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to have a knack for finding unexpected ways to slip out of desperate circumstances— this was, perhaps, why Feng Ge felt so assured.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's speed, he managed to cover a great distance in mere seconds. In around 20 seconds, they could rush out of the channel.</p>

  <p>Although the plan was going smoothly, Zheng couldn't help but feel a little worried.</p>

  <p>Last time, When Zheng passed the second half of the channel with Dorothy, there was a section full of restless energy.</p>

  <p>But in the first half of the channel, Feng Ge had caused a huge turmoil in the energy vortex, which meant the second half would possibly be even more troublesome.</p>

  <p>Just as he was thinking, Feng Ge suddenly called out, "Zheng, look!"</p>

  <p>His lips curled into a bitter smile when he clearly saw what was ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Before he figured out how to cross it, the road ahead had been completely blocked by the energy bands.</p>

  <p>With the channel behind them still narrowing, and the front exit getting sealed off by the energy bands, there was no way out at all.</p>

  <p>"It looks like all I can do now is abandon this body," Feng Ge said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>It was everyone's dream to obtain such a powerful body on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But they had no other way to go— if she didn't give up the body, she and Zheng would die there.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>The energy bands piled up until they were sandwiched in.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>Zheng tried changing a few positions, but the space for him to dodge was lessening.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, don't hold on," Feng Ge said firmly.</p>

  <p>Ready to leave her body, she shut her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Zheng called out as the lightning in his hand flashed, shifting into a spiral-shaped thunder halberd. Aiming at the channel's inner wall, he shot it.</p>

  <p>Just as he expected, these energy bands were of very high grade.</p>

  <p>Once the thunder and lightning the Thunderstorm Godly Way generated entered the area, they were constantly melted down by the energy bands, making it impossible to break through them.</p>

  <p>The wall of energy bands formed a vortex. Several energy bands shot right at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He dodged them quite easily, but a thoughtful look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Seeing the energy bands coming at her from both sides, Feng Ge grew even more anxious. "Zheng, what are you waiting for? If it goes on like this…"</p>

  <p>In the middle of her thought, a lightning bolt flashed from Zheng's fingertip, aiming at a spot on the wall.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Every time he attacked the wall, several energy bands would roll out.</p>

  <p>Instead of returning to their original spots, they mixed in with other bands.</p>

  <p>One by one, the bands rolled out from the wall until they left a great hole.</p>

  <p>"You..." The sight had Feng Ge too dumbfounded for words.</p>

  <p>Never did she expect Zheng to form a path by taking advantage of the energy bands' natural properties.</p>

  <p>"There isn't only one way out." Zheng was perfectly calm.</p>

  <p>More thunder and lightning bolts were released from his body, shooting through the hole. Skillfully dodging the bands, he brought Feng Ge to the hole.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the hole, the energy bands gathered in from the front and back, filling the entire channel.</p>
