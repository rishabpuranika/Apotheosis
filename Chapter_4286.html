<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4286 The Maximum Number Of In And Out Holes</b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>A long time ago, Xuanyuan, Divine Farmer, and Othniel also attempted to destroy many provinces in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Back then, they used the Minimum Spaces' flames to burn down about three hundred provinces.</p>

  <p>However, they weren't fully destroyed.</p>

  <p>Although life was burned, the substances that comprised them were still there, and the foundation for nurturing these substances was still present.</p>

  <p>The entire sea was evaporated by the blazing flames, but the water just turned into rain and returned to the ground.</p>

  <p>However, this time, the Evil God transformed all the materials in the world into pure energy that formed the enormous In and Out Holes. This kind of drastic destruction would never be reversed.</p>

  <p>In the face of the aggressive and terrifying downgrader, the Evil God could only come up with such a method.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Burial Land, a blue light film was unfolded in front of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>At the center of this light film, a huge sphere appeared. This sphere was actually the Source World, and its surface was covered with dark blue spots.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! What are you thinking?" The downgrader let out a loud burst of laughter. "Turning such a massive amount of materials into pure energy is like quenching your thirst by drinking poison. Let's see how long you could hold on."</p>

  <p>At the same time, on the jadeite platform, there was also a blue light film that appeared in front of Luo Zheng. From it, Luo Zheng could sense the miserable situation the Evil God was in.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Evil God has already consumed more than a hundred provinces. So many living beings in the Source World have suffered and were sacrificed," Luo Zheng said with a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, from the perspective of the Evil God, he is doing the right thing,"</p>

  <p>Kincaid said. "It is necessary to sacrifice those provinces, or else, all of the creatures of the Source World would be annihilated."</p>

  <p>"But if all the materials of the Source World are consumed, then there's no point in fighting," the Snake Goddess remarked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as his thoughts aligned exactly to what the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>However, Hilario, who had kept silent all this time, suddenly said, "It's still early to say that..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked at him as they heard what he said.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Bold Conjecture House, Hilario was known to be an extremely knowledgeable and talented person. At this moment, he might have other insight that none of them had thought of yet.</p>

  <p>"Can all of you easily construct a space channel?" Hilario then asked them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the others nodded. It was, in fact, very easy for them to do it.</p>

  <p>Then, Hilario stretched out two of his fingers. Suddenly, a power of space burst out from his fingertips and a thin space channel was instantly formed.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a second space channel was formed. Then, a third, and a fourth...</p>

  <p>Just within seconds, he was able to construct a thousand space channels.</p>

  <p>"Hilario, what are you trying to do?" Even Kincaid was quite confused at what Hilario was trying to prove.</p>

  <p>However, Hilario didn't answer and just continued to build numerous space channels. When he had created about one thousand and five hundred space channels, these space channels between his hands suddenly became extremely unstable. The originally well-arranged space channels started to intertwine with each other, and ultimately, they exploded.</p>

  <p>The moment the explosion happened, Hilario gently rubbed his hands and the mass of energy that exploded immediately vanished.</p>

  <p>"I still don't get it. How is it related to what the Evil God is trying to do?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi couldn't help but ask in confusion.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was the first to state her hypothesis. "The number of space channels in an area should only be limited. If there are too many, they would become unstable and collapse..."</p>

  <p>She had actually done similar experiments before, but she didn't think of this concept.</p>

  <p>"So, what you're trying to say is..." Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed as he kind of understood what was going on inside Hilario's head.</p>

  <p>"The space power contained in the In and Out Holes is several times stronger. Like what I've demonstrated earlier, if there would be many In and Out Holes in the same area, they will all easily collapse," Hilario explained.</p>

  <p>"Then, how many In and Out Holes can this area bear?" Kincaid asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>Hilario furrowed his eyebrows while shaking his head. "I can't say the exact number. Maybe twenty, thirty, or even more..."</p>

  <p>"If the In and Out Holes collapse, will the needle in the hole also be destroyed?" Fuxi asked as he started to understand where the thought was headed.</p>

  <p>However, Hilario still shook his head.</p>

  <p>He couldn't give any definite answer because he could only speculate based on his own knowledge. Besides, it was the first time that someone came up with this idea to deal with the needle. It was impossible to actually know what could happen.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng released twenty-first set of In and Out Holes.</p>

  <p>Then, another set of In and Out Holes was released by the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The Evil God responded by releasing another set, making it the twenty-third in the area.</p>

  <p>The competition that took place after the needle appeared became anticlimactic.</p>

  <p>But obviously, it wouldn't end up in a stalemate, because the Evil God couldn't hold on much longer.</p>

  <p>Every time he transformed some of the Source World's provinces, the Holy Soul Realm warriors and the Eternal Realm warriors on his side would cringe and show a depressed expression. However, they didn't dare to say anything to the Evil God. Right now, it was the Evil God who was deciding on everything. If they would go against him, they might be the ones transformed into energy.</p>

  <p>Even the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't say anything, though his face was also incomparably grim. At the back of his mind, he knew that if this went on, they would definitely lose.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the downgrader released the thirty-first set of In and Out Holes, increasing the number of holes in the area to sixty-two. The needle passed through the maze of holes, making it impossible to determine where was the front end and the back end.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the Evil God transformed over thirty provinces and released a black hole again.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, something unusual started happening.</p>

  <p>The surroundings of the black hole became slightly distorted.</p>

  <p>The more unusual thing was that the distorted ripples around this black hole also appeared in other black holes.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, the Evil God revealed a devilish smile. "Finally..."</p>

  <p>The real Evil God had tens of thousands of avatars, and each one of them possessed exceptional intelligence.</p>

  <p>According to what they agreed upon with the real Evil God, these avatars took action independently and carried out all sorts of odd experiments that usually involved the space power.</p>

  <p>From the start, the Evil God knew that with such a large number of In and Out Holes, they would inevitably collapse soon enough. This was actually what he was waiting for.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God released another white hole, and ripples of space fluctuations also appeared around it.</p>

  <p>When the ripples spread to the other white holes, all of the In and Out Holes began to sway left and right. One moment, they were expanding; the next they were shrinking. Just as Hilario deduced, the huge space channels finally became extremely unstable.</p>

  <p>As a rigid body, the needle would definitely conflict with all of the unstable In and Out Holes.</p>

  <p>Some of the holes that shrank tightly held the needle. The space and the needle violently rubbed against each other, producing ear-piercing sound waves in the entire chaos. As the other holes expanded, they also collided with the needle inside, causing even stronger space distortion.</p>

  <p>Right now, the space was in utter disarray.</p>

  <p>"It's really happening! With the thirty-two set of In and Out Holes, the space couldn't bear them!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord exclaimed in surprise as he witnessed the chaos.</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't seem like the In and Out Holes could do anything with the needle. I think it is withstanding the violent reactions of the holes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian said as he observed.</p>

  <p>"It would actually be better if the needle is cut off by the broken In and Out Holes. The three primitive lands would only be impacted by the space windstorm..." Hilario said in a gloomy tone.</p>

  <p>"But what if it can't be cut off?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, but theoretically, if the needle is able to bear that great force, it would still be compressed and twisted by the power of the space."</p>

  <p>Hilario demonstrated by showing a crooked finger. "Then it would straighten up!"</p>

  <p>He continued demonstrating and flicked his finger.</p>

  <p>With his explanation, the others easily understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>The needle would become as thin as a steel rope, and the great force that it would release would destroy everything it came into contact with.</p>

  <p>Just as Hilario finished his demonstration, all of the In and Out Holes suddenly collapsed simultaneously, leaving many pieces of needles floating in the air. The needle was not actually broken, but it was the illusion created after the space was wrecked.</p>

  <p>The moment that the In and Out Holes collapsed, the pieces of the needle began twisting like countless frantic leeches.</p>
