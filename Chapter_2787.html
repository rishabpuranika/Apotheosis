<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2787 True Demon Body </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>As her magic unfolded, the black mist that lingered in the ice palace dispersed in all directions.</p>

  <p>Like fishes swimming in space, the Devils which had been fighting with Nicholas quickly fled and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>A flame was ignited from below.</p>

  <p>The bright yellow light immediately shrouded its surrounding space.</p>

  <p>The black mist only moved away a little and did not completely dissipate.</p>

  <p>Though shining brightly, the yellow light could only light up the space of tens of thousands of feet around it.</p>

  <p>More figures walked out from behind the woman when the fire was lit up.</p>

  <p>Besides Nicholas, Zeke, Murphy, and Clark were all among them.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands appeared to now be standing behind her!</p>

  <p>That was the result she achieved by forcing so many fierce beasts and fiends to hand in their Faith Energy!</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings, and the consummate True Gods watched in great shock.</p>

  <p>"They are just phantoms!" one of the consummate True Gods said with contempt.</p>

  <p>But no one took in his words.</p>

  <p>Standing right next to the woman, Nicholas was emitting a very powerful aura.</p>

  <p>If it was only a phantom, it would be impossible for him to have such a powerful aura. Also, Nicholas' aura was leaving the same pressure on people as before.</p>

  <p>Flying over from the side of the ice layer, Nicholas floated in the air.</p>

  <p>With doubt clouding his eyes, his gaze initially fell on that woman, and then to his phantom.</p>

  <p>Before Nicholas could say anything, the woman spoke first and took him by surprise, "Do you still want to attack me?"</p>

  <p>In order to give the formless things enough time to copy them, she could only suffer attacks passively. She knew that once the supply of Faith Energy was stopped, all her previous efforts would be wasted.</p>

  <p>With her grumpy personality, how could she tolerate that?</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Her clear voice echoed in the ice palace. The "Nicholas" standing next to her had already leaped towards the sky!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Just like a bicolored dragon, two torrents in black and white entangled with each other and shot towards the real Nicholas in the air.</p>

  <p>It was the Dark Light Torrents.</p>

  <p>Seeing the two Dark Light Torrents, Nicholas was unable to hide the cautious look on his face.</p>

  <p>Crossing his hands, he then condensed the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Another two Dark Light Torrents shot downward.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The Dark Light Torrents released by the two Nicholas collided, but they didn't burst out a strong power. Instead, they intersected, forming an illusory black and white Eight Diagrams in the air before it completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas witnessed this, his face became more serious.</p>

  <p>"It's not a phantom," he said.</p>

  <p>Smiling from beneath him, the other "Nicolas" smiled and replied, "Maybe not."</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas felt weird when he heard his other self answer him like this.</p>

  <p>Still, he kept his composure and replied, "Is this why you led us into the ice palace?"</p>

  <p>Blinking her eyes lightly, the woman answered, "This is just one of my purposes. Have I not told you that the supreme treasure of belief is in the ice palace? Since you're already here, your luck will determine whether you can get it or not."</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes lit up upon hearing her words.</p>

  <p>While they were busy with this discussion, the "Clark" next to the woman took out a fiery red seed from his space ring.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the seed, the real Clark exclaimed in confusion, "This woman can even copy the items in my space ring?"</p>

  <p>The Heart Fire Seed was a rare plant in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Not moving from his position beside the woman, the clone of Clark tossed down the Heart Fire Seed.</p>

  <p>As the seed descended, a pattern of flame appeared on its surface. In an instant, the entire seed became fiery, turning itself into a huge ball of fire.</p>

  <p>The dense ice layers melted instantly as soon as the fireball met their smooth surface, creating a path along the way as the seed came down.</p>

  <p>The fire started clearing the black mist on its path, allowing the Holy Beings to see clearly what was down there.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the Heart Fire Seed finally had fallen to the bottom of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>"That supreme treasure of belief is at the bottom of the ice palace," the woman said with grin.</p>

  <p>Hearing those words, the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods couldn't help but look down. With their sharp vision, they could see clearly what was down there, even if it was hundreds of thousands of feet away.</p>

  <p>"An ice coffin!"</p>

  <p>"In that ice coffin is a little girl?" one of them asked.</p>

  <p>"Is that a corpse? Does it have anything to do with the supreme treasure of belief?"</p>

  <p>By now, the curious Holy Beings were all staring at the ice coffin below.</p>

  <p>They could see a girl's corpse sealed in the ice coffin. She seemed to be sleeping. Looking at her, none of them could see anything special about this little girl.</p>

  <p>Unlike the others, Samuel's eyebrows couldn't help but twitch violently when he saw the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>His thoughts trailed back to the days when he was still Gregorio. That was the time when he had obtained the Spear of Supreme Harmony after breaking into a secret land on the fifth stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>He clearly recalled seeing some mysterious patterns on the walls of that secret land. One of those pictures was of a square coffin, similar to the ice coffin below.</p>

  <p>Those mysterious patterns also included the Spear of Supreme Harmony that he now possessed, so he deduced that those patterns would all be the supreme treasures of belief in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the picture of the coffin was placed above all the other pictures, leaving a deep impression on him. At that time, he inferred that the coffin had something to do with the supreme treasure of belief that controlled the Abyss Demon Region. Even though he got reincarnated and started another life cycle, Samuel still remembered everything instinctively.</p>

  <p>"That's the supreme treasure of belief that controls the Abyss Demon Region," the woman said faintly. "If anyone's interested, you can try to get the True Demon Body."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had been a little vigilant before, but after hearing her suggestion, traces of greed immediately reflected in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that's the sixth level supreme treasure of belief in the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>"Whoever controls it will be able to control the power of the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"Wait, if the supreme treasure of belief has existed here for countless years, why have you not taken it yourself?" a Holy Being asked curiously, his eyes darting towards the woman.</p>

  <p>The fact was, she was waiting for the Holy Beings to get down there to get the True Demon Body. When she heard the question, she fiddled with her bangs and admitted, "Of course, because I am not capable to get it. If I could do it myself, why else would I leave it to you?"</p>

  <p>"Can you clarify on what you just said?" Zeke couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, the woman sat on the edge of the ice layer and looked down at the ice coffin as she explained, "Whether you can get it or not depends on your abilities. I won't say anything else. I can only tell you that, of course, it's extremely difficult."</p>

  <p>In the past, she had tried with Sword Chen's clones for countless times, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>In order to increase her success rate, she had also worked hard to guide the real Sword Chen to insert his long swords into the Sea of Meditation, so as to absorb the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>With this being said, Sword Chen didn't know about her existence, nor did he know that she had helped him secretly.</p>
