  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Divine Kingdom Continent was far more powerful than the Central Region in almost every way.</p>

  <p>However, this had not always been the way. Hundreds of years ago, the Central Region could proudly claim Zheng as their own. There had since been a series of shifts in power and Cloud Hall now was in the hands of Lewis.</p>

  <p>Lewis was nowhere near as gifted as Tianming or Zheng. He was not even greater than Patrick.</p>

  <p>However, the resources of Cloud Hall made up for his short-comings.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, after his travel to the Upper World with Zheng and Tianming, Lewis gained a great deal— more than he imagined he would.</p>

  <p>With only Cloud Hall's vast resources and all he learned from the Upper World, Lewis had improved immensely. He had become much more than he was before, now possessing a strength unshakable in this great world.</p>

  <p>He was capable of conquering the entire Divine Kingdom Continent on his own, should he so choose.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the four from the Divine Kingdom Continent saw Lewis not just as intimidating, but as a man who meant the words he spoke, a man not to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>The war king of the York Divine Kingdom thought for a moment and said,</p>

  <p>"Even if you did manage to kill all the war kings and war emperors of our four divine kingdoms, we have countless citizens, and many of them will become fine and powerful warriors. When next time the Divine Kingdom Continent battles with the Central Region, the Central Region would stand no chance of victory, you must see this. Let us be civil about this, we are neighbors after all. Why don't we both take a step back?"</p>

  <p>"Take a step back? That savage land has been untamed for tens of millions of years, and now you claim it to belong to the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>Is this because your Divine Kingdom Continent is closer to the land, or because you believe yourself to be more handsome?" Lewis asked with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Because we're closer to the land," Callan, the war king of the Wind Divine Kingdom, replied foolishly.</p>

  <p>Fredric, the war king of the York Divine Kingdom, glared angrily at Callan.</p>

  <p>Callan had been a fool since childhood and Fredric despised it. He knew that even in this most serious of situations, Callan would take the opportunity to act childish wherever he saw it.</p>

  <p>The dispute between the four divine kingdoms and the Central Region was over the savage land.</p>

  <p>Over the last few hundred years, the territories of the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent had been entirely explored. The warriors of these two continents had almost simultaneously looked towards the savage land as their next frontier. All forces crossed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and headed towards the land, hoping to make it theirs.</p>

  <p>Although the land was indeed closer to the Divine Kingdom Continent, it still remained a lawless land where no one had any power or control. More and more warriors had gone to the land, and more and more conflicts arose.</p>

  <p>Warriors from the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent clashed constantly.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, a war broke out in the land. The warriors of the York Divine Kingdom and the Star Field Divine Kingdom had killed over a hundred warriors of the Ethereal Spirit Sect in the Central Region. The Ethereal Spirit Sect then turned to the Cloud Hall for help. Lewis responded by traversing through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and to the Divine Kingdom Continent. He fiercely killed no less than thirteen warriors at the Life and Death Realm, shocking the entire continent.</p>

  <p>Overtaken by grief and indignation, the three war kings and one war emperor of the Divine Kingdom Continent marched on the Central Region, searching for an explanation from Lewis, which resulted in the previous conversation.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>"Lewis is hundreds of years old, yet still so amusing."</p>

  <p>As Lewis' conversation with the four came to an end, out of nowhere laughter could be heard from above.</p>

  <p>The entire room wore a collective frown as they spread their spiritual senses upwards. Lewis too was shocked. His face drew in a solemn expression as he reached out high with his spiritual sense to discover who had silenced this meeting.</p>

  <p>The voice seemed so clearly in front of them, yet they could not detect it at all.</p>

  <p>This could only mean one thing: the voice's owner was far stronger than any of them.</p>

  <p>Lewis felt the voice to be quite familiar, but he just could not place it.</p>

  <p>"You need not look for us. We are here."</p>

  <p>In a corner, Zheng and a group of women slowly appeared.</p>

  <p>Lewis froze on seeing Zheng and Yudie. But soon, pure joy washed over his face. "Master Yudie! Zheng!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Lewis was the leader of Cloud Hall. However, seeing Yudie had thrown all that out the window. He lost all sense of decorum for his position, turning back to a disciple of the Cloud Hall all those several hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>"Lewis..." Zheng smiled and looked at the four from the Divine Kingdom Continent. "Callan, Randy, how have you been?"</p>

  <p>Randy and Callan could not bring themselves to respond and just stood there dumbfounded. They had never imagined Zheng would return after he had ascended to the Upper World several hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>During the past hundreds of years, the powers of the divine kingdoms had changed a lot.</p>

  <p>Randy had won over the crown prince and become the war emperor of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Callan too had legally taken over the throne to become the new war king of the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"You...you... Are you really Zheng?" Callan asked foolishly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>The memories of Zheng were unforgettable, and though the man in front of him definitely appeared to be the same man, he possessed a vastly different temperament.</p>

  <p>The four could feel an extraordinary magical power emanating from Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng did nothing to encourage any feeling in any of them, they all began feeling as insignificant as ants.</p>

  <p>Randy was very excited too. Now that Zheng was here, the dispute they'd been having could be resolved.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already risen to the Upper World when competition for the throne of the Harlen Divine Kingdom had begun. He had no effect on how that ended, but he had a far-reaching effect on Randy. Randy had been missing Zheng all these years.</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago, I said I would be really lucky if I got to see you after I descended to the Upper World. I didn't expect to see you back here," Randy muttered.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he did not know that even if he flew to the Upper World, he would not be able to find Zheng. After all, Zheng had already gone to the divine land.</p>

  <p>As fast as Zheng appeared, the tense atmosphere enveloping the Ice Palace was dissipated.</p>

  <p>Everyone was familiar with Zheng, even intimidated by his strength, and the women standing behind him. This no doubt brought everyone down a peg, adding some humility to the scene.</p>

  <p>They were unable to tell their cultivation level, be it Zheng, Yudie, Margaret, or even Aura who possessed the lowest cultivation level. Although they hid their strength, the auras flowing from their movements still stunned everyone. After all, these were True Gods.</p>

  <p>After some pleasantries, Zheng turned the topic back to the reason for their gathering. "I heard that savage land caused your dispute?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>Knowing Zheng would ask of this matter, they detailed the dispute in an almost rehearsed fashion.</p>

  <p>There was no right or wrong, only each continent's interests at play.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could say anything, Yudie jumped in, "Although Cloud Hall doesn't attach any great importance to the savage land, it's unacceptable for the Divine Kingdom Continent to bully the Central Region and Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Yudie harbored no desire to live in this world, but the Cloud Hall was her home. Her allegiance to where she grew up was undoubtable, so was her intent on protecting the sect and its disciples, and who could argue with her reasons for it.</p>

  <p>Her words left the four from the Divine Kingdom Continent stunned.</p>

  <p>Randy and Callan looked helplessly at Zheng, hoping above all else that their old friend would react sensibly. Surely he could see this sort of view was unreasonable; it would give the Central Region an unfair advantage in occupying the savage land.</p>
