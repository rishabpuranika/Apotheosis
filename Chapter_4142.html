  <p>
</p>

  <p>The expansion of his cinnabar field caused some pain.</p>

  <p>When it expanded, so did his inner world.</p>

  <p>But naturally, the scale of their expansion differed.</p>

  <p>His cinnabar field had only expanded half a finger's distance, while his inner world had expanded beyond a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>The next second, his cinnabar field began shrinking. But his inner world did not follow? it only stopped expanding.</p>

  <p>Following that, while his cinnabar field continued to expand, his inner world expanded over a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body seemed to have entered a subtle state.</p>

  <p>With every second, his inner world was expanding a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, who guarded Luo Zheng from outside, took notice of his wondrous state. She then transformed into a strand of soul and drilled into his inner world? her clear eyes widened in surprise at the sight before her.</p>

  <p>Previously, the continents occupied nearly seventy percent of space within Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>But now, all the continents floated in the sky, occupying less than ten percent of the inner world.</p>

  <p>The primitive land had expanded so fast, the expansion not ceasing in the least.</p>

  <p>Each time Luo Zheng's inner world expanded, some of the flesh substances at the bottom of the world disappeared, turning into blood-red meridians that extended toward the edge of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Both Dale and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already understood that the expansion of Luo Zheng's inner world was based on the flesh substances.</p>

  <p>"The expansion of about a thousand miles will consume over a hundred masses of flesh," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"To be exact, a hundred and three masses of flesh," Luo Zheng said in return.</p>

  <p>"And the expansion will extend for a thousand and two hundred miles, to be exact. There are a total of fourteen million masses of flesh in my inner world."</p>

  <p>At that number, the Snake Goddess' eyes widened. "How vast will Luo Zheng's inner world be?"</p>

  <p>"It will be an inner world with a diameter of over a hundred million miles.</p>

  <p>It must be countless times larger than it is now, but it's still far smaller than the Source World," Dale answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>"At this rate, it will probably take several months to completely consume all of the flesh," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also realized that the rate of expansion was rather slow. "It shouldn't have to take so long," he chimed in.</p>

  <p>Gently turning his hand, he made a burning joss stick appear in his grip, emitting a curling fragrance.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a strange light enveloped him, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and Dale, along with the continents and the Immortal Mansion above.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng changed the time flow rate of his inner world, everything began advancing rapidly.</p>

  <p>The flesh substances disappeared in an instant as his inner world continued rapidly expanding.</p>

  <p>When the joss stick in Luo Zheng's hand was completely burnt, the flesh substances beneath their feet finally disappeared, which were then replaced by a broad space. Its bottom was made up of meridians that were tens of millions of miles long.</p>

  <p>Compared to such a space, the continents floating in the sky served as tiny building blocks.</p>

  <p>"The world is so empty," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has to create more lives?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Dale said in return, scratching his head.</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Once again, the other three stared at him with fierce eyes.</p>

  <p>There was nothing Dale could do but deliver his master's message.</p>

  <p>"Let me try to build the world."</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's omniscient power, building a creature-filled world was an easy feat.</p>

  <p>Sea water was important to the inhabitants? he wanted to first fill his empty world with sea water.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had already done it twice.</p>

  <p>The first time was when he formed his Soul Sea, and the second was when the chaotic sea was created. Now, it was the third time.</p>

  <p>But just as he was going to exercise his omnipotent power, his body stiffened slightly, stunned.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the power that ruled everything in his inner world had disappeared!</p>

  <p>For several times, Luo Zheng tried waving his arms, getting flustered. "I? I'm not the master of this world?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was supposed to be omniscient in their own inner worlds with everything under their control. Space, earth, water, time, and lives were no exception. Such was the most basic rule of the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>Now, the invasion of the ancestry-level bloodline rendered Luo Zheng's omniscient power ineffective? he couldn't help but feel flustered.</p>

  <p>"Strictly speaking, this world is constructed by the ancestry-level bloodline? it may not be obedient to you right now," said the Snake Goddess, pointing at the blood mist that had spread across the sky.</p>

  <p>"The ancestry-level bloodline has once deprived you of control over your body. This can't be worse than that," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged helplessly. "You're right."</p>

  <p>As for how to deal with the huge inner world, all they could do was wait and see.</p>

  <p>But at this very moment, the meridians at the bottom of the world began trembling as a white mist gushed out.</p>

  <p>The moment it appeared, Luo Zheng's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's expressions shifted slightly.</p>

  <p>The two felt the aura of the bloodline power simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"This is Gonggong's bloodline power." Even the Snake Goddess noticed it.</p>

  <p>"No." The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head. "His bloodline power is purer, but the aura in the white mist is far more complicated."</p>

  <p>"In addition to the seven abilities in the creation quadrant, there are also four other abilities in the life quadrant," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>As he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, he managed to analyze the nature of any kind of energy. Such an analytic ability was given by the ancestry-level bloodline. Later on, it took the ability back.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, in his inner world, Luo Zheng had regained the analytic ability.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Boundless white mist covered the world. It continued piling up and rising slowly, approaching Luo Zheng and the rest.</p>

  <p>As the white mist rose into the sky, it shifted into clouds. Once they were thick enough, they would form a heavy rain.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>It began to rain in the inner world. This time, a real sea was finally formed within Luo Zheng's body, replacing the former chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A bolt of lightning shot out from the blood mist, streaking through the sky and sinking right into the sea.</p>

  <p>"The lightning contains the sixteen abilities of the destruction quadrant,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>High mountains in the sea rose continuously, containing two abilities of the creation quadrant.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, one of the mountains split apart, allowing lava to flow from it.</p>

  <p>The lava seemed to be emitting the aura of the bloodline power as well.</p>

  <p>Enlightenment then struck Luo Zheng at that moment.</p>

  <p>The power of the ancestry-level bloodline was everywhere in this newly constructed inner world.</p>

  <p>If the inner world was completed, wouldn't it be easy for him to obtain the power within?</p>
