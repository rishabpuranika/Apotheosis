<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Luo Zheng would have never taken advantage of a woman to use her as a shield.</p>

  <p>However, this place was not the universe that he came from! The rules of the game were very different here.</p>

  <p>Right from the beginning when Luo Luo Zheng started training to become a warrior, he had never lacked strong supporters.</p>

  <p>He also knew that these mighty warriors backed him only due to the so-called 'destiny'. These powerful masters would regularly motivate him to progress further and move forward all the time.</p>

  <p>But here in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Luo Luo Zheng had to rely solely on himself.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Princess Royal who he had captured was provoking him.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for this pestering woman, he would not have encountered a bizarre event right after he arrived in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land!</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape..."</p>

  <p>A world lord called Woodrow hung behind Luo Luo Zheng, the cyan light constantly flashing in his hand, which indicated that he intended to use another theurgy.</p>

  <p>"If you get any closer to me, I promise you that I will cut off her head," warned Luo Luo Zheng finally. Since these people were so concerned about this woman, they would certainly care about her life.</p>

  <p>However, his words failed to have the desired effect!</p>

  <p>Using a hostage to threaten the powerful warriors was not a very good negotiating tactic. Many formidable warriors felt that a hostage could only be exchanged for a small amount of conditions, but it was impossible to threaten them with no limits. And even if Woodrow agreed to Luo Zheng's request, the Princess Royal could still be killed in the end! It was a gamble he was unwilling to play.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Woodrow acted as if he hadn't heard anything. The cyan light in his hands became brighter and brighter. He was preparing for an extremely vicious soul attack? the Soul Shock!</p>

  <p>Once this move was executed, all living beings within a radius of several dozen miles would temporarily turn into zombies, as their souls became stagnant...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed when he saw that his threat was useless.</p>

  <p>The opponent could read his mind. He was only trying to escape, and did not have the heart to harm the woman he was holding captive!</p>

  <p>If it continued this way, Luo Luo Zheng would be in dire straits!</p>

  <p>Suddenly a strange call came from behind him!</p>

  <p>The cry seemed to have come from underground!</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The shocked Woodrow saw that the Formless Sky Python was twisting and turning. At the same time, a huge crack appeared on the ground behind the Formless Sky Python, after which the ground tore open, as if something huge was breaking out from beneath!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The ground exploded, and another Formless Sky Python drilled its way out from it!</p>

  <p>"Two Formless Sky Pythons?"</p>

  <p>"NO! It is the same one... Bloody hell! That is the tail of the Formless Sky Python!"</p>

  <p>"This monstrosity has two heads!"</p>

  <p>The enormous python was thousands of miles long, and no one saw its tail!</p>

  <p>After the Formless Sky Python's head was sealed by the world lord's Wishing Spell, another head emerged from the ground and crashed into the blue space!</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>With just one hit, countless cracks appeared in the space!</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>In the distance, Kennan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned pale. Alarmed, he cried out, "Woodrow! Employ the Wishing Spell right now to suppress this beast!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this horrifying turn of events, Woodrow had to leave Luo Luo Zheng behind.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal was still in Luo Zheng's firm grasp. He had only wanted to use this chance to run for his life, and he thought that this might be the time to escape. But if the Formless Sky Python managed to break free from the Wishing Spell, then everyone would be obliterated!</p>

  <p>"Follow him!"</p>

  <p>Woodrow ordered the other martial artists, as his figure floated up. His hands intertwined and he pointed his index fingers at his own forehead!</p>

  <p>"I have invoked the Wishing Spell, which will descend upon us with the divine soul. I hope that the souls of all living things will reincarnate, and that the world will never cease. I hope the world will be peaceful all the time and all the evil souls in this world will be vanquished!"</p>

  <p>"Crash!"</p>

  <p>An enormous soul pressure descended suddenly!</p>

  <p>This soul was probably a hundred times stronger than Woodrow's own soul!</p>

  <p>This mighty soul conquered the soul of the Formless Sky Python!</p>

  <p>The other head of the Formless Sky Python, which was desperately snapping at the seal set up by Kennan, was writhing frantically. The cracks on the blue space were also increasing, but just as Woodrow's Wishing Spell was about to terminate it, the Formless Sky Python suddenly slowed down its movements! It seemed to be disoriented and weak.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is this Wishing Spell? It's so powerful..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was intrigued and shocked at the same time. It was obvious that Woodrow was a world lord, but his method of casting the Wishing Spell was even more powerful than that of any Supreme Lords who Luo Luo Zheng had encountered!</p>

  <p>He was still in shock but he continued to rush forward madly.</p>

  <p>The group of Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists behind him also chased after Luo Luo Zheng closely without showing any signs of stopping!</p>

  <p>They didn't have as much responsibility as the other two world lords so they didn't dare to attack Luo Luo Zheng. They only pursued him, constantly warning him to let go of the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was surely going to ignore these people. He would never let go of his hostage until he was sure that he was safe.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt something move in his hand. He was startled with the sight before him and he quickly flung the woman in his arm away!</p>

  <p>"Whap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng used all his strength, throwing the Princess Royal hundreds of feet into the air. She floated upside down, as her body was enveloped in blue flames.</p>

  <p>From within the flames, a bright and beautiful smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth and spoke in a gentle voice, "Do you still dare to hold me hostage?"</p>

  <p>When the group of warriors, who were chasing Luo Luo Zheng, saw this, they were delighted!</p>

  <p>"Where did the flames come from?"</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten the princess's title?"</p>

  <p>"Princess of God-burning Flame!"</p>

  <p>"The God-burning Flame is her theurgy! That's how she burst into flames."</p>

  <p>As the martial artists saw this, they knew that the Princess Royal would be fine. At least, there was nothing that Luo Luo Zheng could do about her!</p>

  <p>The princess was born with this strand of God-burning Flame within her.</p>

  <p>After her birth, the God-burning Flame had turned her biological mother into ashes! When she grew up and found out about this unfortunate event, she felt very guilty. As a result of this, she had a great hatred for her innate theurgy!</p>

  <p>Thus, although the Princess Royal possessed the title, very few people dared to mention it. Furthermore, she herself rarely used this theurgy!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation base was an entire realm lower than the princess's, but she was still unable to break free from his grip. She had used this theurgy as a last resort.</p>

  <p>But she hesitated before using her special powers.</p>

  <p>Her goal was not to kill Luo Luo Zheng. If somebody was tainted with the God-burning Flame, they would definitely die. Therefore, when she used her theurgy, she slowed down a bit to allow him to loosen his grip!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reaction was just as she hoped. In almost an instant, he had tossed her away!</p>

  <p>"BOOM!"</p>

  <p>After spinning once in the air, the Princess Royal lightly tapped her toes on the ground. The temperature of the burning flame was very high, and as it crept down her toes, the soil beneath her feet instantly melted, creating a ripple like water!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no idea what was going on, so he had tried his best to protect himself before chucking the princess away.</p>

  <p>But when he observed the flame, a strange smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal was perplexed when she saw his expression.</p>

  <p>Shouldn't this fellow be helpless and surrender at this point?</p>

  <p>However, after three seconds, his figure suddenly flashed and pounced on her!</p>

  <p>"Aah! No!" she screamed!</p>

  <p>At this moment, she wasn't worried about herself, but Luo Luo Zheng! He would be burnt crisp!</p>

  <p>Surely, Luo Luo Zheng must have known that he should not touch the flame, but he still charged at her. In her opinion, this was no different than suicide!</p>

  <p>And so, a weird scene played out.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal was like a dragonfly as she whizzed about in the air and kept stomping down on the ground. The soil beneath her feet melted in an instant, forming a large scorched mud puddle. The trees around her carbonized as well and turned into charred dead wood.</p>

  <p>However, she had retreated to save Luo Zheng's life!</p>

  <p>Like a poisonous hedgehog, she desperately backed away, afraid that she would hurt him.</p>

  <p>The small army behind them didn't dare to make any wrong moves in a hurry. The Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists were well aware of the power of the flame on the princess's body. If they got too close to her, they would surely lose their lives...</p>

  <p>"Don't come here. I'll set you ablaze!" she warned in a panic.</p>

  <p>Her theurgy was extremely special. When she was young, she had never been able to gain complete control over it, and even those in the divine land were unable to explain the origins of the flame. As a result, as she grew up, she would often accidentally ignite the flame and burn down large portions of her house...</p>

  <p>There was a look of pure horror in her eyes now.</p>
