  <p>
</p>

  <p>Having received the Snake Spirit King's orders, Sewell and the Snake Masters quickly mobilized and transmitted the commands to their subordinates.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, all major forces in the Heavenly Square City began to move out.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the Treacherous Beings found this war kind of boring.</p>

  <p>They knew almost all the names of their opponents and some of them even recorded the times they'd killed each other.</p>

  <p>"I've killed that same guy forty-nine times. Just leave him to me! I'll make my count reach fifty!"</p>

  <p>"I hope the Bird Masters won't target me again."</p>

  <p>"I want to fight against my opponent alone!"</p>

  <p>These were the kinds of conversations that could be heard among the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Endless resurrection had rendered death insignificant and they felt no fear in the face of impending doom.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the Snake Masters informed them that their coordinates were to move out of Heavenly Square City and into Mist City.</p>

  <p>The Mist City was currently occupied by the Bird Masters.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Snake Masters chose to put up a desperate fight to gain control.</p>

  <p>This caused the Treacherous Beings to doubt the operation and a few radical warriors even refused outright to go.</p>

  <p>However, their coordinates were in the hands of the Snake Masters so any sort of resistance was futile.</p>

  <p>News soon spread across the three human houses and the human spirits could only look at each other in understanding.</p>

  <p>They already knew something was up with the Snake Spirit Sect. The suspicion towards the sect was deeply set in their hearts the moment they awoke.</p>

  <p>The prospect of leaving crossed their minds but they knew it would be meaningless if they couldn't take their coordinates with them.</p>

  <p>Now that the Snake Spirit King gave this order, they realized that this was potentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

  <p>Alphonse, the leader of the Joy House, was the most eager for this chance.</p>

  <p>He had long been aware of the Snake Spirit Sect's hypocrisy and itched to take back what was his.</p>

  <p>"This time, the three houses of the Human Spirit Sect are under Gianni's command!" a Snake Master announced. "Listen to him! If you don't, I'll erase your coordinates and kill you."</p>

  <p>Gianni was someone who had always been loyal to the Snake Spirit Sect so they naturally trusted him to lead the operation.</p>

  <p>"Alphonse, Hamilton, I'd appreciate it if you lend me a hand if we ever run into trouble in Mist City," Gianni remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Their faces instantly darkened and a lot of the other human spirits present shot Gianni a harsh glare.</p>

  <p>As a general of the Ten Directions House, Gianni was able to come into power by groveling to the Snake Masters and punishing his own clansmen. He was, essentially, a disgrace to the human spirits.</p>

  <p>Even those from the Broad House did not associate with Gianni but did not dare to complain given the latter's status.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they began their journey towards Mist City.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's beard had gotten warped.</p>

  <p>"Dale, you have to go."</p>

  <p>"No," the young man in a cyan robe vehemently refused. "I don't want to die!"</p>

  <p>They were within the protective bubbles at the bottom of the Jade Pure Realm. If they left, they would most likely be discovered, which equated to a swift death. There was no way the young man would be willing to die.</p>

  <p>"You are the one with the most special ability amongst all disciples. The possibilities of them discovering you are small," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord assured him.</p>

  <p>However, Dale shook his head stubbornly. "We can wait for Luo Nian and have him deliver the messages," he said.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed and tried to reign in his annoyance. "There's no time for waiting. Luo Zheng and the others have already left the Source World and the snakes and birds are set to fight anytime soon. We cannot let this opportunity pass."</p>

  <p>Based on their previous plan, Luo Nian was the one tasked to deliver the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's messages.</p>

  <p>However, after he greatly enhanced the Lone Sword's power, Luo Nian climbed towards the top of the pillar and was never heard again.</p>

  <p>They got no news of him whether he was in trouble or if he was alright.</p>

  <p>"One more day," Dale bargained.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Half a day?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Two hours?"</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>To Dale's horror, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord began to forcibly expel him.</p>

  <p>The ground began to bubble and a huge force sucked Dale's body out.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was swallowed up by the ground, several vines quickly shot out towards him.</p>

  <p>These plants grew in the Jade Pure Realm and possessed extraordinary intelligence. They moved like snakes, placid and still at first yet ready to strike when Dale came near.</p>

  <p>Completely wrapped by the plants, he had no choice but to stop moving.</p>

  <p>After a while, Dale's body soon turned a shade of emerald green and became one with the vines that crawled along the ground.</p>

  <p>This was his bloodline power: to turn into anything and everything in this world.</p>

  <p>Several green vines began to make their way forward. They crawled for over a hundred miles until they arrived in front of a pure black desert which was one of the places with a bad environment in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>When they entered the vicinity, the sand began to shake and countless thumb-sized insects emerged.</p>

  <p>These insects attacked any living creature that entered the desert.</p>

  <p>However, before they could launch their attacks against the vines, the plants suddenly split into hundreds of pieces. From dark green, they transformed into pure black and morphed into the appearance of the black insects.</p>

  <p>Dale continued to change his form along the way and was able to leave the Jade Pure Realm successfully as a group of rats.</p>

  <p>It was quite a sight to see a dozen rats enter the Grand Pure Realm. Dale was heading north, towards the Night View Island's entrance.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he arrived, two Monkey Masters stopped him, or rather them since his form was a group of rats.</p>

  <p>In order to prevent any future damage to the Night View Island's passageway, the Monkey Spirit Sect saw it fit to employ two powerful Monkey Masters to guard it.</p>

  <p>They had sharp eyes and were immediately alerted by the arrival of these rats.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?!" one of them barked. "Show your true self."</p>

  <p>With his demand, the rats began to pile up and soon morphed into Dale's true form.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the Monkey Masters respectfully. "Monkey Masters, I have something important to report."</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that the Monkey Masters knew of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Luo Zheng's group so they did not dare to reject humans. They did not ask Dale any more questions and took him into the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had just finished dealing with the Li Shan mountain's matter since its separation from the Source World caused the human heroes a bit of considerable panic.</p>

  <p>So he was a bit curious when he was told that a human had requested to see him.</p>

  <p>The sight of Dale dumbfounded the human heroes. What was the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's eldest disciple doing here?</p>

  <p>"Dale?"</p>

  <p>"You're not dead?!" "You're alive!"</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who was always the epitome of calm, was stunned.</p>

  <p>Dale pouted sourly. "Did you guys expect me to die?"</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven simply brushed off his attitude.</p>

  <p>"How is the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord?" he asked. "Is he still alive?"</p>
