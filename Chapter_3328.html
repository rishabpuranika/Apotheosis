  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What was that white light just now?" a Soul of Light from the Bearing race inquired in visible confusion.</p>

  <p>When Ling Shuang fell into the Dark Region, they had all witnessed a strong flash of light appear before their eyes. It was rather unusual to experience such a light in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Even though Ajay was from the Other Shore, he didn't know the answer to this question. They didn't know much more about the Dark Region than the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>"I have no clue," Ajay replied as he laughed spitefully. "Since that little girl is dead, all we can do is wait. If that physical body is still alive, it will appear sooner or later!"</p>

  <p>Ajay said as he clenched his fists with a vicious fighting spirit fuming in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race was willing to offer such a high reward that even the Golden Body race was unable to refuse. On the other hand, the description they gave of that strong body piqued Ajay's interest. The Golden Body race was easily tempted by the thought of battling different mighty warriors, and Ajay was no exception.</p>

  <p>Enveloped in the white light, Ling Shuang sat stunned on the ground. She was convinced she had not survived the fall.</p>

  <p>She didn't even understand how she was dragged into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Recalling back to what had just happened to her, she remembered taking a step back before she was wrapped in the rays of white light.</p>

  <p>Staring at the pure white light, Ling Shuang kept herself composed. "Why didn't I feel any pain when I died..."</p>

  <p>As she looked more closely, she noticed a person emerge from the white light. It was hard to make out the appearance under the influence of the overwhelming light. Even so, in a single glance, she had recognized him to be Luo Zheng. Accompanying Luo Zheng on the Other Shore for such a long time, she had kept his image in her mind. She could never mistake him to be someone else!</p>

  <p>But she kept her emotions in check even at the sight of Luo Zheng. She had heard that people would often hallucinate things that didn't exist in reality after they died. Maybe she missed Luo Zheng too much for her to see him in front of her like this.</p>

  <p>"Still in a daze, huh?" Luo Zheng chuckled as he walked up to Ling Shuang, with a sweet smile smeared across his face. He waved his hands in front of her jokingly.</p>

  <p>"What?" Ling Shuang was muddled. At this moment, she noticed Feng Ge standing beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Instinctively her brows arched up in confusion.</p>

  <p>Why would she hallucinate Feng Ge, even though she only had Luo Zheng on her mind?</p>

  <p>Moreover, she was able to see Feng Ge's face as clear as day.</p>

  <p>She wasn't on good terms with Feng Ge, then why was it that she hallucinated her of all people?</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, is she stupid?" Feng Ge asked as she giggled while glancing at Ling Shuang's puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Ling Shuang snapped out of her confusion and retaliated, "You're the fool!"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was not inferior to Feng Ge in any aspect when alive. And now that she was convinced she was dead, she wasn't going to hold her words back either. It fumed her how even now, this hateful woman had the guts to mock her.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Suddenly, Feng Ge's face darkened as anger reflected from her expression. She gave her fingers a turn, and the white light surrounding Ling Shuang began to disperse.</p>

  <p>Considering her child-like tendencies, she showed no concern for other people's lives.</p>

  <p>If the white light were to disappear completely, Ling Shuang would be swallowed by the darkness and eventually die.</p>

  <p>"Stop that right now," Luo Zheng said in a brusque tone.</p>

  <p>Taking notice of Luo Zheng's disappointment, Feng Ge stopped immediately. She eyed Ling Shuang up with dissatisfaction as she pouted.</p>

  <p>Though her memory was impaired, she instinctively didn't like Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>"Don't be confused. You're not dead. You just fell into the Dark Region,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said as he offered his hand out to help her stand up.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang stood up and began to scan her surroundings, still in a daze.</p>

  <p>Everything was so overwhelming for her that she took her time to process it all in her head before she spoke, "Am I really alive? Luo Zheng, Feng Ge, are you two okay?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and gave her a warm smile. "Don't worry. I was the one who drew you into the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>Stumbling upon Ling Shuang was really a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had taken a long journey in the darkness before he saw the front of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been consulting the Green Jade Spirit about how to fuse with the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Just as he was putting away the Civilization Artifact, he had noticed a human Soul of Light being chased by other human Souls of Light along with creatures from the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>It was hard for Luo Zheng to make out who it was while in the Dark Region. Even so, he was alerted when he noticed the birds from the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Since the Jin Wu always followed the Bearing race, he instantly concluded those human Souls of Light who chased behind were of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. No matter who it was that they were chasing, Luo Zheng had to intervene and foil their plans.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng's theory was proven correct when he and Feng Ge followed after the human Soul of Light only to find out that it was Ling Shuang! Quickly, they stationed themselves behind her.</p>

  <p>To make sure she was safe, he had pulled Ling Shuang in from the Light Region.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng briefed her about everything, Ling Shuang still stood stunned for a fair amount of time. She still found it hard to believe his words and said,</p>

  <p>"But... You? How can you roam the Dark Region so freely? And this light doesn't seem like it's coming from the candles!"</p>

  <p>From what Ling Shuang had known, they could only rely on the light coming from the candles to move through the Dark Region. At this moment, three rays of light simultaneously shot out from above their heads and wrapped itself around Luo Zheng and Feng Ge. Such a technique was truly remarkable to watch!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Feng Ge's profile and smiled. "It's Feng Ge's ability."</p>

  <p>"Her ability? No, it can't be." Ling Shuang stared at Feng Ge with her mouth agape. "And she has a physical body? This... This is incredible."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge now had a body in the Dark Region. Anyone could easily see her face and every feature except for the clothes she wore that were woven by rays of light.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang couldn't process everything in one go. All this new information was too overwhelming for her.</p>

  <p>The matter involving the purified beings was too hard to explain at once.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to clarify everything to Ling Shuang just standing there. He gestured to her and said, "Come on. Let's get out of here. I think it's time to pay back those who chased you with interest."</p>

  <p>"No, stop!" Ling Shuang immediately reached out to Luo Zheng and stopped him in his tracks. "They're from the Golden Body race. They are one of the strongest races of Stage Thirteen, far more powerful than the Abyss Spirit race! They were hired by the Bearing race to hunt and kill you!"</p>

  <p>"Are they really that strong?" Luo Zheng raised his brows, seemingly unfazed by her description.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are!" Ling Shuang nodded frantically to make him take the situation seriously.</p>

  <p>Previously, she had been worried about how she would be able to reach Luo Zheng in time to let him know about them. She had never thought she'd be able to meet him in the Dark Region. It all felt like a dream to her.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was capable of moving freely in the Dark Region, he could leave it when he wished too.</p>

  <p>Even after all her attempts to persuade him to stay, they were to no avail.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked back at her and sneered confidently. "I'd like to witness this power for myself."</p>

  <p>As he finished his words, he took a step out of the Dark Region. Just like before, a ray of white light flashed through the darkness, and Luo Zheng had already made his way out of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Outside, Ajay had no interest to stay and study the white light. He turned to the members of his race and asked them to leave with him. Meanwhile, the Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were engrossed in a heated discussion on what the light indicated.</p>

  <p>The white light didn't disappear. They were still able to make out a faintly visible white shadow through the darkness, but they failed to figure out what it was supposed to be.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the white light became brighter and brighter with time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they all saw a person emerging from it.</p>

  <p>The human Souls of Light that stood fascinated by the view, were left shocked. They yelled in confusion and started to retreat frantically.</p>

  <p>With confident steps, the person approached them and said with a smirk across his face, "I heard that you were waiting for me in front of the Grand Sky Temple?"</p>

  <p>Ajay, who was preparing to leave, turned his head when he heard the voice from behind. As soon as his gaze fell on Luo Zheng's physical body, he was unable to take his eyes off of him. He tilted his head and began to study it carefully.</p>

  <p>Human...</p>

  <p>Blurry face...</p>

  <p>An aura that was different from that of the Souls of Light...</p>

  <p>Ajay immediately believed this person to be the corporeal body the Bearing race had told him about!</p>
