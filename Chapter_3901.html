  <p>
</p>

  <p>The spiritual attack that Judson launched relied on the soul. It was energy in essence.</p>

  <p>The abilities of the spiritual level in the ancestry-level bloodline were mostly gathered in the area symbolizing life.</p>

  <p>The moment the illusory world enveloped Luo Zheng's body, the ancestry-level bloodline started to react. Luo Zheng felt a chill rushing up from his back and integrating into his soul. In the blink of an eye, the huge world was broken.</p>

  <p>Judson stared at Luo Zheng with amazement. "The person you chose is really extraordinary, Gerald," he said just before blotting out the expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Gerald took a slight glance at Judson. A moment ago, Judson thought he oversold Luo Zheng, but now his attitude changed.</p>

  <p>Gerald floated out of the pool. "Luo Zheng, this is another Chaos Ancient God, Judson," he said.</p>

  <p>He motioned to Luo Zheng to come closer for an introduction.</p>

  <p>"Master Judson," Luo Zheng greeted Judson politely, cupping his hands towards him. It seemed that the spiritual attack Judson had launched was just a test for him.</p>

  <p>"You really are an exceptional young man," said Judson as he narrowed his eyes, appearing as if he expected highly of him. "The bloodline you have been infused must be the origin-level bloodline. It happens to be the bloodline that can resist the soul attack, right?"</p>

  <p>If the origin-level bloodline that Luo Zheng obtained could strengthen his soul, then it made sense that he was able to easily resist Judson's attack.</p>

  <p>Gerald chuckled. "Judson, you can try another way," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Judson felt strange about Gerald's request, but he did as he was told.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his claw towards Luo Zheng's head, and an indefectible glazed goblet appeared out of nowhere. It flew towards Luo Zheng, trapping him with no escape.</p>

  <p>Strong energy engulfed the entirety of the goblet. It was obviously not an ordinary object.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the energy surged inside the goblet, Luo Zheng felt a great debilitating pressure running through his veins and across his body.</p>

  <p>If his cultivation base was lower than the Eternal Realm, the energy could have crushed him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his finger and lightly tapped the transparent wall, digging a small hole.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The great pressure in the goblet was unleashed from the hole, forming an energy sword. The impact of the pressure then shot the sword towards the pool.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The calm waters of the pool began to ripple from the aura of the energy sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Judson with questioning eyes. He broke the goblet only with a single tap. His strength was evident.</p>

  <p>Judson was introverted. However, he was also competitive. 'I don't plan on losing to you, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The truth-level energy from his claw soared, combining with the energy from the glazed goblet. A blinding blue light was emitted.</p>

  <p>Realizing that Judson was unwilling to admit defeat, Luo Zheng stretched out his hands and scratched the goblet wall even more vigorously.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>The goblet started to disintegrate from more holes made by Luo Zheng's move. It couldn't bear Luo Zheng's strength any longer and finally broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Judson was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>"If I remember correctly, this Heavenly Glazed Goblet is the strongest thing you have ever made?" Gerald said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>"It used to be," Judson replied. "But now it's not."</p>

  <p>Among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Judson possessed the creation truth, the only way that chaotic energy was transformed into any kind of material.</p>

  <p>It was similar to the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>However, the creation token which used the power of truth was naturally much stronger than the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Not only could Luo Zheng easily break free from Judson's spiritual attack, but he was also able to destroy the Heavenly Glazed Goblet effortlessly. Such methods were inconceivable for Judson.</p>

  <p>In fact, Gerald did not invite Luo Zheng to show off his strength.</p>

  <p>Judson, Kendrick, and Gerald did not support the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Their gathering in the Li Shan mountain was because they advocated the Finale Way, and they had always hoped to complete it. And now, Luo Zheng was the only one who could complete it.</p>

  <p>Judson had come all the way to meet Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng's performance was beyond Judson's expectations, which confirmed that his trip wasn't rather useless. At least, he would firmly stand by the Li Shan mountain's side.</p>

  <p>After leaving the pool where Gerald was located, Luo Zheng had to go to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Yudie had asked about Luo Nian's current situation, and on the other hand, Ziya would be a great help in the oncoming battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to activate the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. He was about to enter the Deleting Space when he felt a force of resistance. He was actually being rejected by the Deleting Space!</p>

  <p>He had entered the Deleting Space for several times, but this had never happened before.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" he pondered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but have a bad feeling. He was wondering and confused at the same time.</p>

  <p>After trying and failing for several times, his face darkened.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly spoke, "Don't worry. The change in the Deleting Space might have something to do with Othniel."</p>

  <p>Othniel had also participated in the battle this time. It was Othniel's token to delete the space into the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>It was most likely that Othniel had discovered the secret of the Deleting Space, so Ziya might have done something to protect it.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was smart. His guess could somehow be close to the truth.</p>

  <p>"That makes sense." Luo Zheng nodded as he was feeling a little relieved.</p>

  <p>It was a risk to place Luo Nian in the Deleting Space. However, it was his own choice as he was already an adult, but Luo Zheng did not intend to tell Yudie about this.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was in deep thought about the mystery of the Deleting Space, Luo Nian and Ziya were passing through a plain in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>After a long and tiring journey, they reached a spot close to the four huge black pillars. A strange plain with big and small caves suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Could those caves be worlds?" Luo Nian wondered as they walked towards them.</p>

  <p>He pulled Ziya into one of the caves. They explored the inside and found that he guessed right.</p>

  <p>The worlds were similar to the chaos. There were independent spaces within, which were not as vast as the worlds they knew. They were much smaller.</p>

  <p>Just as before, dead silence filled the caves. No living being thrived as there was no evidence of life.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had given up exploring and moved towards the four giant pillars.</p>

  <p>At the end of the plain was the nearest black pillar.</p>

  <p>After passing through each round cave on the seemingly unending plain, Luo Nian finally saw the huge pillar in front of him.</p>

  <p>The pillar seemed to be formed by numerous pages of book. The thick and huge pages were placed in a spiral, forming an upward stair.</p>

  <p>Walking to the side of the pillar, Luo Nian reached out his hand and touched a black page. To his surprise, his hand felt that it was not made of paper, but of solid stone.</p>

  <p>He blinked his eyes in disbelief and proceeded to step on a stair.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped on the stair, a light orange thread appeared and flew into the distant sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian frowned and looked at the thread, confused.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the thread was headed to the direction of the chaos.</p>
