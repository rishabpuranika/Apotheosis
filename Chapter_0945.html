<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>How would the human race survive the ogres? What would happen to them now?</p>

  <p>In the Cursed Land, there was a transmission array and all sorts of majestic patterns were engraved around it. There were even sculptures of birds and beasts around it, which appeared extremely mighty and domineering. This was the ogre's transmission array!</p>

  <p>Since the ogres used to control the Tower of Sin, their transmission array proved to be a lot grander than those of the other races.</p>

  <p>With a flash of white light, a figure as large as a small mountain appeared.</p>

  <p>He was Maurice, the top-level war lord of the ogre!</p>

  <p>After leaving the Tower of Sin, many ogre top-level war lords chose to break through. Since they had accumulated plenty of Lucky Light after fighting for so many years, it wasn't difficult for them to break through and reach the war sage level. However, even though it was easy for them to break the bottleneck and achieve a breakthrough, Maurice decided against it.</p>

  <p>The moment he was forced to leave the tower, he already planned a counterattack scheme. The moment Luo Luo Zheng entered the Dark Nether Cave, Malcom and Rehaan would be able to kill him!</p>

  <p>And because of that, Maurice prepared to return to the Tower of Sin the moment Luo Luo Zheng entered the Dark Nether Cave. He really wasn't in a hurry to break through. After all, he still wanted to become the ruler of the Tower of Sin! And with that, within the two ogre sacred places, Maurice suppressed his own cultivation. He was waiting for this day!</p>

  <p>Following Maurice, many top-level ogre war lords walked out of the transmission array, with malicious smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>The time they had endured being driven out of the tower had been enough, and now that their revenge was nigh, they were feeling good. The fact that their race was chased out of the Tower of Sin was an unbearable humiliation to them, and today, the time to take what was theirs had come.</p>

  <p>The numerous top-level ogre war lords started to approach the Tower of Sin, and they all looked like hills on their way to tear the tower down.</p>

  <p>When they got close, the majority of the creatures inside the tower saw them, and all of their expressions changed. It was very clear that there was going to be a big commotion inside the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>These creatures had watched the ogres leave, and now, they would witness their return!</p>

  <p>At the door of the Tower of Sin, there were two giant guards. When they saw the group of top-level ogre war lords approaching them, fear became evident on their faces.</p>

  <p>Maurice looked down upon these giant war fighters and couldn't be bothered to talk to them. And with that, he just bellowed, "Open the door!"</p>

  <p>The two giant guards quickly pulled open the door to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Soon after, all of the top-level ogre war lords entered the first floor of the tower!</p>

  <p>On the first floor of the Tower of Sin, many creatures were still fighting on the arena. However, the moment they saw the top-level ogre war lords coming, they were all startled and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has expelled the ogres already, right? How are they back here again?"</p>

  <p>"You really have very little information as to what happened to Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Luo Zheng died during his exploration of the Dark Nether Cave!"</p>

  <p>"Really? If that really happens, then wouldn't the human race be in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng's fault. He had just overestimated himself. He was just a war general, but he really dared to explore the Dark Nether Cave. Not only did he die, he even caused the entire human race great trouble! Who knows, they might be extinct the next day."</p>

  <p>Murmurs arose in the tower as the creatures from many different races started discussing among themselves.</p>

  <p>There were many human war fighters on the first floor of the Tower of Sin and they were all scared and upset. Back then, the warriors of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had to become war generals before they could enter the Tower of Sin to practice. However, since Luo Luo Zheng took control of the Tower of Sin, the status of the human race in the tower had greatly changed, and now, many human war fighters had got the chance to enter the Tower of Sin for cultivation without prior experience.</p>

  <p>Now that these war fighters were seeing the return of the ogres with their own eyes, they obviously knew what had happened. Soon enough, all of the humans in the Tower of Sin would probably be punished. Because of that, the human warriors wanted to secretly leave the Tower of Sin. However, their legs had already turned to jelly, and had no strength to escape.</p>

  <p>The top-level ogre war lords were still calm, but their bodies were already emitting a tyrannical Mu Ning as they entered the tower and as they went up the floors. Now that so many top-level war lords had entered the tower, they had attracted the attention of almost everyone.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, Maurice had finally climbed up to the fifteenth floor.</p>

  <p>He stepped into the hall at the top of the tower with his heavy metal boots.</p>

  <p>With a deep breath, he once again threateningly bellowed towards the small worlds in the depths, "All of you, the seats owners, come out!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the small worlds!"</p>

  <p>"Come out right now!"</p>

  <p>Many top-level ogre war lords who were staying behind Maurice also joined in.</p>

  <p>After a while, the doors to the small worlds opened one after another. Many seat owners came out.</p>

  <p>The Night Group members who held the seats came out first. After they got out, they stood beside Maurice. The Night Group was always controlled by and depended on the ogres, and even if the ogres were driven out of the Tower of Sin, it was a thing that would remain unchanged. After all, their Eternal Night Sacred Place was under the protection of the two ogre sacred places.</p>

  <p>The top-level human war lords and the top-level Demon Night war lords were the last two to appear.</p>

  <p>Maurice took a glance at the top-level human war lords and suddenly let out a loud laughter, "Top-level human war lords... You were the creatures pestering the fourteenth floor in the past, right? What qualifications do you have to become a seat owner? Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>All the top-level ogre war lords started to laugh. Even the top-level war lords of the Night Group started laughing with them.</p>

  <p>The top-level human war lords were livid. They were angry, but there was nothing they could do about it. Strength was the only thing that mattered in the Tower of Sin, and they were nothing after losing Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the members of the Demon Night were relatively calm.</p>

  <p>After all, they had the powerful Heavenly Feather Sacred Place backing them up. Suddenly, they heard Elder Mei say coldly, "What do you want to do?"</p>
