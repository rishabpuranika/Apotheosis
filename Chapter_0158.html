  <p>
</p>

  <p>Among the top-grade mysterious weapons owned by Luo Luo Zheng, this big axe looked the best. Luo Luo Zheng thought that more heavenly essence could be extracted from melting this weapon.</p>

  <p>Previously, seven drops had been obtained from melting that pair of short swords. Thus, Luo Luo Zheng inferred that the big golden axe would produce more heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>However, it was beyond his expectation that only three drops of heavenly essence were obtained from the melting of the axe.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was a little confused as to how much heavenly essence was contained in a top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>He felt lucky that he owned a variety of top-grade mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>In terms of quality, it appeared as though some were superior, while others were not.</p>

  <p>As per Luo Zheng's experience, depending on the quality of a top-grade mysterious weapon, the number of heavenly drops that could be extracted varied from two to nine drops. He had never come across a weapon that yielded more or less than that range.</p>

  <p>As expected, five drops of heavenly essence could be obtained from a top-grade mysterious weapon on average.</p>

  <p>He spent the whole night melting weapons.</p>

  <p>Each time, Luo Luo Zheng manipulated the black fire to melt the top-grade mysterious weapons. After about 100 weapons had been melted, Luo Luo Zheng was the proud owner of more than 500 drops of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>Since the black fire had been used unceasingly from the last late night to this morning, it seemed to have lost its energy. Earlier, it had been relatively happy, but now it appeared to be powerless and didn't fly as forcefully as before. At last, it hovered in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The black fire seemed capable of feeling fatigue too.</p>

  <p>Seeing the black fire in that wretched state, Luo Luo Zheng felt a little pitiful and thus stopped melting.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he took two hundred drops of heavenly essence out of the bottle and tossed them at the black fire.</p>

  <p>Like a little dog that had smelled a bone, the black fire was suddenly filled with vitality. As soon as it engulfed the two hundred drops of heavenly essence that Luo Luo Zheng had isolated from the bottle, it gained a little enthusiasm. Then it retreated into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng took a breath, all two hundred drops of heavenly essence were poured into the mouth of the sculpture of the cyan dragon inside the huge furnace.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, a dragon scale emitted a clear, bright, and green light.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, more dragon scales lit up one after another.</p>

  <p>After a while, forty dragon scales had lit up on the sculpture of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Luo Zheng had lit up a total number of forty seven dragon scales on the sculpture of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Those dragon scales were placed together side by side. On observing them, Luo Luo Zheng found that all the lit dragon scales looked like a small magnificent landscape.</p>

  <p>He felt a little excited when observing the green light in a blaze. Now, his strength had increased tremendously. Luo Luo Zheng wondered how much his strength could be enhanced if he channelled the power from all forty-seven dragon scales at the same time.</p>

  <p>If this were possible, Luo Luo Zheng would be powerful enough to free himself from Jesse's sky-binding hoop when he was trapped in it again.</p>

  <p>Based on his enhanced strength, Luo Luo Zheng would be capable of smashing nature creatures, who had just reached the nature level, using only his fist.</p>

  <p>After melting over a hundred top-grade mysterious weapons, Luo Luo Zheng stopped to take some rest. Even the black flame had diminished with all this melting. And so, he wanted to let the black fire to rest for a few days before starting his melting again.</p>

  <p>During these few days, Luo Luo Zheng went out at times, but he spent most of his time cultivating inside his room.</p>

  <p>Several days later, all top-grade mysterious weapons purchased from the Weapon Pavilion had been melted by Luo Luo Zheng. He poured half of the heavenly essence obtained from the melting into the mouth of the sculpture of the cyan dragon in his mind. In doing so, more than a hundred dragon scales twinkled with a bright, green light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still held over six hundred drops of heavenly essence, and he planned to sell them all.</p>

  <p>However, he had some misgivings.</p>

  <p>At the previous auction, 50 drops of heavenly essence had been sold. But they had caused the bidders to become overexcited. The participants in the auction had bid competitively for the heavenly essence, and its price had risen astonishingly high.</p>

  <p>Hence, Luo Luo Zheng was a little worried about whether he would bring attention to himself if he put all six hundred drops of heavenly essence for sale at the same time.</p>

  <p>As the saying goes, an innocent person might bring attention or troubles to himself for something precious he owns. Luo Luo Zheng feared that he would become a target once people knew that he had so much heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng trusted Wurth and even contemplated giving the heavenly essence to Wurth for safekeeping. What worried Luo Luo Zheng was that Wurth did not have final authority in the Zhang family. Once his family members discovered the quantity of heavenly essence, they might pressure Wurth into disclosing the identity of the seller. Then they might question or pressure Luo Luo Zheng for more heavenly essence. Luo Luo Zheng could think of all troubles that would be caused after that.</p>

  <p>Given the situation, Luo Luo Zheng had to reconsider the auctioning of the heavenly essence carefully.</p>

  <p>These days, it was very peaceful on Drizzle Peak. The disciples were assiduously cultivating and mediating, and there was no in-fighting.</p>

  <p>Everything with Luo Luo Zheng went smoothly as well.</p>

  <p>Despite the mighty power of Heavenly Ogre Fist, this tier five cultivation method was rather hard to practice.</p>

  <p>It was still very early in the morning. The darkness was slowly being replaced by the first wisps of sunlight from the east. Luo Luo Zheng was practicing the mind method. He closed his eyes and focused on the task of flinging his fists toward the sky one after another.</p>

  <p>Only after all the demonic life energy inside his body had been consumed did Luo Luo Zheng sit in silence to meditate. He practiced the mind method of the Purple Light Fist to cultivate life energy that the demonic life energy needed to consume to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>In spite of extremely great difficulties in practicing the Heavenly Ogre Fist, Luo Luo Zheng had gradually become more and more skillful in his cultivation after repeated attempts.</p>

  <p>Now, he could not only easily and proficiently make the first move of the Heavenly Ogre Fist, namely, Ogres Shaking the World, but he also mastered the second move, which was known as the Swarm of Ogres Surging.</p>

  <p>Although the second move was not as mighty as the first, Luo Luo Zheng could attack many targets simultaneously. He thought it would be beneficial if many enemies confronted him.</p>

  <p>Part way through his meditation, Luo Luo Zheng heard tolling sounds from the hillside of Drizzle Peak. Since he was cultivating at an unnoticed corner of Drizzle Peak, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find anyone around him to ask why they were being summoned.</p>

  <p>"The toll only sounds when all outer disciples are required to gather together. What on earth has happened?" Standing on a cliff, Luo Luo Zheng stared at the hillside. He watched quietly as several disciples walked towards the plaza on the mountain peak. Curious, Luo Luo Zheng stopped his cultivation, jumped off the cliff, and rushed toward the plaza.</p>

  <p>When he arrived, almost all outer disciples had gathered in the plaza.</p>

  <p>In the center of the plaza stood Mu Ning. She wore a light blue dress, and beside her, stood a huge thing.</p>

  <p>A yellow curtain full of magic symbols and incantations hid the thing from the outer disciples.</p>
