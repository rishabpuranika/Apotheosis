<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how loud the noise behind them became; they weren't stopping anytime soon.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python wasn't very intelligent. But Luo Zheng had no idea why it had locked its target on the princess.</p>

  <p>They rushed at a speed that led them thousands of miles away in under five minutes.</p>

  <p>If any strange beasts lurked ahead of them, they didn't have time to think about it. All they could think of was to try their best to distance themselves from the Formless Sky Python.</p>

  <p>This time, a rumbling sound rang out from behind. The enormous creature continued to follow them.</p>

  <p>It looked like the Formless Sky Python wouldn't stop until it devoured the woman beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how Kennan and Woodrow were doing. All they could do was try their best and get away as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>This thick forest land stretched for a thousand miles. They'd gotten some distance ahead when a massive lake appeared before them. They had gradually moved onto the highlands, from plains to hills.</p>

  <p>Despite them running at full speed, the distance between them and the Formless Sky Python was quickly closing.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Look out!" the princess suddenly cried out. The oil-paper umbrella she was holding came to an abrupt halt in midair.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how to deal with this woman, especially since he could neither kill her nor shake her off because she was so stubborn in following him.</p>

  <p>All they could do right now was escape together. But it was still somewhat baffling to Luo Zheng as to why they had gone in the same boat.</p>

  <p>"In front of us is the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race. It is one of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land's aboriginal races," the princess replied.</p>

  <p>"Aboriginals? Are they dangerous?" This woman was referring to the Collapsing Mountain race as aboriginals and Luo Zheng knew from this that the princess was from the divine land.</p>

  <p>The princess pursed her lips and replied, "It's hard to say. The aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land have a strong enmity towards outsiders, but it's not all impossible for us..."</p>

  <p>Before she could finish talking, Luo Zheng had rushed out, muttering under his breath about how this woman lacked judgment.</p>

  <p>They would die if they remained where they were. But if they continued onward, they might still have a chance of survival. The choice was easy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had, however, forgot the fact that the princess had taken a huge risk to go search for a warrior that had landed on the teleporting areas like Luo Zheng after night had fallen. If the Collapsing Mountain race could make someone like the princess hesitate, it wasn't going to be simple.</p>

  <p>The princess hesitated for a moment before catching up with Luo Zheng. She knew she had no other choice.</p>

  <p>If the current situation were anything to go by, even if the princess were able to enter the safe area, the Formless Sky Python would still be able to follow her. No one knew how many people were going to die then.</p>

  <p>And no one knew when they would come out once they entered the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race. .</p>

  <p>A rumble sounded from behind them as a huge shadow emerged from one lake and dove into another.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!"</p>

  <p>The princess huffed and followed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng discovered the strangeness of this place as he passed through the hilly area.</p>

  <p>He had been flying at a constant height of seventy to eighty feet and it was only now that he found that a few stones were scattered in the air, floating lazily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked up a small stone and examined it carefully, only to discover that it was just an ordinary stone. There wasn't anything special about it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tossed it away and it fell down, carving a parabolic path as it went.</p>

  <p>This stone very obviously was not a floating stone, which he had met several times in the universe.</p>

  <p>The princess watched as Luo Zheng explored the place and said, "It is the Collapsing Mountain race's force field. It's almost in a disorderly state but it is very special."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at her explanation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew everything about the inner world and the structure of the universe.</p>

  <p>The more mature the inner world was, the stricter the rules would be.</p>

  <p>The universe that Luo Zheng came from was an inner world of a Holy Being. It was as Tianming had said, that the Holy Being had one foot in the grave.</p>

  <p>But the structure of the world from the bottom up - the Lower World to the Upper World and then to the stars - was complete. The rules were almost the same, but at different levels.</p>

  <p>But the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was not a complete universe.</p>

  <p>It had probably been intentionally made this way by the Holy Being who built it, which was why its rules were quite strange.</p>

  <p>The further he went, the more stones he saw floating in the air. The stones grew in size as they traveled. Fist-sized stones, then, millstone-sized stones. They floated slowly in the air, as if they were weightless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also sensed the chaotic force field, but its power was insignificant at the moment, which was why it wasn't having much of an impact on Luo Zheng and the princess.</p>

  <p>The colossal body of the Formless Sky Python jumped from one lake to another. Every time it dove into a lake, its ten-thousand-foot wide body would occupy the entire lake, draining it of water and forming a small tide that flowed towards other lakes.</p>

  <p>But it was still wandering the lakes and did not follow Luo Zheng and the princess into the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>This gigantic beast was also hesitating. . .</p>

  <p>After the Formless Sky Python had rolled about seven or eight times, the lakes began to crack and connect together to form an enormous lake.</p>

  <p>Seemingly unable to endure the temptations of its target, this Formless Sky Python had finally made up its mind.</p>

  <p>It chose to move forward to go beneath a great mountain.</p>

  <p>As the mountain shook violently, the Formless Sky Python created a massive cave that was tens of thousands of feet high.</p>

  <p>"It's coming. We need to speed up." Luo Zheng could tell from the trembling of the earth that the Formless Sky Python was getting closer and closer to them.</p>

  <p>They slowed down as they entered this area. Conducting necessary exploration was a useful way of survival for martial artists when they entered a strange place. But the crisis behind them told Luo Zheng that they did not have time to bother with what was happening here. Other threats were nothing compared to the threat of the enormous being behind them.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't long before Luo Zheng realized that he was ridiculously wrong in thinking thus.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, they had been able to choose to avoid the floating stones as they traveled. But as the rumbling sounds drew closer, Luo Zheng cleared a path, smashing aside all the stones along the way.</p>

  <p>He had previously absorbed the flame from the princess' body into his own, but his body had not reached a new level.</p>

  <p>This flame was effective on Luo Zheng, but the amount he had absorbed was just not enough.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that this woman was quite useful to him.</p>

  <p>If he could get out of this crisis, he would ask her to have him absorb more flame to temper his body.</p>

  <p>As he advanced at a high speed, Luo Zheng broke apart one huge stone after another.</p>

  <p>The stones he encountered at first were yellowish brown sand stones. But as he went ahead, he saw stones that were colored blood-red.</p>

  <p>These were iron ores, slightly harder than the previous ones. But they were no different to Luo Zheng, who shattered them to pieces with a single hit.</p>

  <p>As they advanced, the red stones gradually disappeared and cyan stones began to appear. These stones were columnar in shape and were twice as hard as the iron ores.</p>

  <p>The stones they saw along the way changed colors from cyan to brown, then to blue, and then became crystal clear.</p>

  <p>They finally encountered black stones that Luo Zheng couldn't break. He had to take a detour, having failed to shatter the huge rocks. This way, he finally had to slow down.</p>

  <p>"I'll lead," the princess said, raising the oil-paper umbrella in her hands.</p>

  <p>The umbrella's ribs folded backwards, making it look like a spear.</p>

  <p>Zheng's interest was piqued as he saw the changes in the umbrella. He had always known, somehow, that this woman's umbrella was incredibly magical.</p>

  <p>The princess pointed the umbrella ribs towards the front and made it spin.</p>

  <p>A thin blue spiral slowly came into existence. It was thin as an arm and had a sharp tip, like a long, constantly twisting snake. The black stones shattered the moment the tip of the spiral touched them. Its power was beyond amazing.</p>

  <p>The princess was truly leading the way!</p>

  <p>Once they broke through the black boulders, silver floating boulders appeared once again before them.</p>

  <p>The princess rushed forward to break the silver boulders apart. But they had only flown about seventy or eighty feet when they felt a strong attraction force pulling them over.</p>

  <p>This force was too great for them to resist it.</p>

  <p>The two of them felt dizzy for a moment. And then, they began to fall heavily towards the silver rocks.</p>

  <p>When they came back to their senses, they discovered that they were lying on top of a silver boulder. But they couldn't move their limbs. It was as if they were stuck to this silver boulder.</p>
