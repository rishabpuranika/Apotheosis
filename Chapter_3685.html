  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan and Feng Ge saw the energy soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi as it went straight to his head.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi owns a special soul pendant. This strand of soul..." said Concubine Yan, but she trailed off in hesitation.</p>

  <p>With the protection of the soul pendant, no one could snatch Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. The energy soul released by Luo Zheng would probably be instantly recognized by the soul pendant and then annihilated.</p>

  <p>However, this energy soul was a strand of the soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself, though it gave off a strange aura.</p>

  <p>While Concubine Yan was worried, the energy soul entered Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body without a hitch. Within a few seconds, his eyelids trembled and he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>His eyes shone brightly, as if stars were within them.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan gave a hard look at Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She couldn't stop blinking in disbelief that he had woken up.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty..."</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan couldn't help but grab onto him, feeling him to make sure he was real and alive.</p>

  <p>Embarrassed on behalf of Concubine Yan, Feng Ge pulled her back and said,</p>

  <p>"Mother, that is not my father."</p>

  <p>From her experience on the Other Shore, she knew the truth.</p>

  <p>However, she had no clue whether the man before them was the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi or not. After all, both the soul and the body belonged to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, though one was real and the other was a clone.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but still be puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible," said Concubine Yan, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>If the body shell of Eastern Emperor Taiyi had really been snatched, his aura wouldn't be as familiar as it was right now. Because of this, she stuck to her judgment and decided that Luo Zheng probably woke up Eastern Emperor Taiyi by some means.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi took a look at Concubine Yan and then turned towards Feng Ge. He gave her a warm smile as he said, "We meet again. Is this your mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Feng Ge replied with a nod. "She seems to have mistaken you for my father."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded back and looked at Concubine Yan. "I am indeed Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but not the one you knew. He was a seed I sowed in the chaos."</p>

  <p>"A seed?" Concubine Yan gasped, not knowing what was going on.</p>

  <p>Seeing the confusion of her mother, Feng Ge continued to explain, "The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi went to the Other Shore a long time ago. Mother, you must have heard of the human race on the Other Shore, right? My father was a clone created by the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi."</p>

  <p>She made sure to keep it simple so that she didn't bombard Concubine Yan with the news. Concubine Yan nodded as she tried to absorb everything. She had heard of all kinds of legends about the human race on the Other Shore from her husband, but she had never seen them once in her life.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who observed from the side, gave a faint smile. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi, may I know how much strength you can display?"</p>

  <p>He placed the energy soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi into the body so that he had the power to go against Emperor Di Jun. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't exert all his strength, they might as well be doomed.</p>

  <p>Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood up, he reached out his arm and the Purple Rainbow Sword materialized. After he gave it a good look, his eyes looked up towards Luo Zheng. "What a good sword."</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but be impressed. "The gap between souls can't be ignored," he continued, "but in other aspects, I may be able to display one hundred percent of the strength."</p>

  <p>The strand of energy soul was too weak that Eastern Emperor Taiyi could not withstand the soul attacks. However, with the help of the soul pendant, he was not threatened by ordinary soul attacks. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that Emperor Di Jun would use the soul attack on him.</p>

  <p>Just then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi began to read and analyze the Memory Flames of his clone. If it was a soul invasion, reading the Memory Flames would take a while and could even be rejected. This was because the Memory Flames did not belong to him.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not bothered with any of these problems. As if instantaneously, he was able to read and understand all the Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Right there and then, a loud boom echoed from the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the mountain, big holes and gashes appeared. Along with small blue squares, Emperor Di Jun flew high into the sky again.</p>

  <p>As he dragged the corpses, they began to break even if they were woven by the Corpse Weaver. Apparently, even if they were determined to get revenge, they still had a limit.</p>

  <p>As for the strong warriors like Pearce who hung onto the corpses, they were covered and smeared in dust and dirt.</p>

  <p>At this point, Emperor Di Jun had thrown away many people, leaving only five people behind. Included among these people was Pearce.</p>

  <p>"Since you seem so damn persistent, don't blame me for this," said Emperor Di Jun, looking back at Pearce with a smirk across his face.</p>

  <p>As he spoke his last word, he opened his wings wide. A shadow of the sun appeared behind him, and the temperature of the atmosphere rose.</p>

  <p>Because he'd already used the Nine-Sun World Destruction token, he could not use it again. However, this was no problem to him, because he could still release the strongest divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As his wings flapped and lifted him into the air, fire snakes grew out from the sun shadow behind him. These snakes stretched out their necks and spouted flames, all directed towards Pearce and the rest.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>As the flames rushed towards the group, they tried their best to dodge. If not, they would be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Clinging on to the mountain wall, Auden shouted, "Elder Pearce, please let go!"</p>

  <p>It seemed that there was no point in trying to stop Emperor Di Jun, because he was determined to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Pearce used the back of his hand to wipe the mud off his face. He then summoned his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Equinox Flowers began to sprout and bloom one after another around him and the others.</p>

  <p>The Equinox Flowers were not as effective as the one that had trapped Emperor Di Jun before, but they were still capable of absorbing everything through the space token. As the fire snakes spat out flames, the flowers absorbed them and they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>Seeing the helpless thing Pearce did, Emperor Di Jun couldn't help but let out a chuckle.</p>

  <p>As more flames were thrown at the flowers, they rose into flames and the inner spaces were burned through and through.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the blazing divine flames spread out and made their way towards one of the men, instantly burning him to ashes.</p>

  <p>Though Pearce was not one to give up, he had to act smartly. He finally let go of the corpse, and the others followed suit. Pearce continued to move, but shook his head in disbelief. They had failed.</p>

  <p>While the group retreated, the once indestructible corpses collapsed and were burnt to a crisp.</p>

  <p>Just then, Pearce descended from the sky and landed on a huge stone, kneeling and facing down.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As soon as his kneel made contact with the stone, it disintegrated into powder.</p>

  <p>In fact, the direction to which he knelt was the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>For countless years, he had been working for Eastern Emperor Taiyi with much loyalty and perseverance. He couldn't help but be consumed by disappointment due to the fact that he wasn't able to protect him.</p>

  <p>After kowtowing, he continued to ascend back into the sky. At this point, all he could do was fight with his life.</p>
