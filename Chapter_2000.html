<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2000 Surprise Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had held high positions for too long a time for them to relinquish control of a situation. They always liked to take control.</p>

  <p>As the most powerful figures in the universe, they didn't like being manipulated by their own destinies.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng had declared war, only the ogre race and the human race had taken any action against their enemies. The Supreme Lords who were living in seclusion and the Supreme Lords of other small races merely stood by and watched, unwilling to meddle in the battle.</p>

  <p id="top_7">But after Zheng's appeal, some of the smaller races showed signs of taking action.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Supreme Lord Shadow and Supreme Lord Korbin of the Demon Night did not support the collective decision of the Demon Night, nor were they willing to join in the rebellion against the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>They were in two minds, trying to measure the impact the current situation would have on themselves.</p>

  <p>When they found out that getting rid of Luo Zheng would benefit them, their decisions were easy to make.</p>

  <p>"You deal with Luo Zheng. I'll kill Leroy," Supreme Lord Korbin said flatly.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow raised an eyebrow at Supreme Lord Korbin. "You seem quite confident. Leroy is severely injured but his power must not be underestimated."</p>

  <p>These two Supreme Lords didn't think Luo Zheng was as strong and remarkable as the world thought him to be. They also thought that Supreme Lord Leroy was very old and had been seriously injured before, so he could not be as powerful as he used to be.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Let's get to work!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Supreme Lord Korbin turned into a cyan flame and began to burn.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow turned into a black shadow and disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the Inauguration Altar, the three bands of light continued to roll and condense before Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>Their attack made it harder and harder to condense the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the Faith Energy was condensed also slowed down considerably.</p>

  <p>Three cracks sounded out and the bands of light formed from the Faith Energy finally broke apart and all of the Faith Energy returned to the Inauguration Altar. They had successfully passed through the Faith Trial.</p>

  <p>The millions of pilgrims beneath the Inauguration Altar wore looks of despair.</p>

  <p>The pilgrims would not allow anyone to enter the Inauguration Altar. It would be a disgrace to their queens. But they weren't strong enough and other than using the Faith Trial, there was no other way for them to stop Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>But Supreme Lord Leroy didn't slaughter any of the pilgrims. In a battle at this level, he had no intention of involving any ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>"We passed just like that? It's very easy then," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy shook his head. "We just got lucky today. Come with me. Let's go to the Inauguration Altar."</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking and looked up, his expression shifted.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed with a golden light as he suddenly shot out into the air.</p>

  <p>As his body spun rapidly, he shot a black Sun-extinguishing Arrow at the spot he had just left.</p>

  <p>Among the arrow techniques that Supreme Lord Leroy had cultivated, the Scorching Sun Arrow was a skill that he was most famous for. But it was not the most powerful of arrow techniques. The Sun-extinguishing Arrow was a powerful technique that he had comprehended after becoming a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The arrow pierced through the sky, extinguishing the sun and moon with just a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>The Sun-extinguishing Arrow could only be used when he faced a martial artist of the same level.</p>

  <p>The black arrow shot out like a ray of black light. But when the arrow reached the location, it remained floating in the air. It swayed back and forth, unable to move forward.</p>

  <p>With a pop, a strange cyan flame suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>As the cyan flame continued to burn, it gradually enveloped the Sun-extinguishing Arrow that Supreme Lord Leroy had sent out. As the fire continued to grow stronger, a human shape formed within it. It was holding the black arrow shaft in its hand.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the flame dissipated and a slim young man appeared.</p>

  <p>A faint smile played on his face as he looked at the black arrow shaft in his hand. He pinched at it gently and it turned to dust, scattering in the wind.</p>

  <p>"Korbin!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy looked stern and worried at the same time. The thing he was most worried had happened.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords, especially Supreme Lord Shadow and Supreme Lord Korbin, were not as easy to fool as ordinary martial artists. If they wanted to interfere, things would become troublesome and complicated.</p>

  <p>"Long time no see, Leroy." Supreme Lord Korbin smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why are you stopping me? You want to help them? But they..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy said, trailing away as he stared at Supreme Lord Korbin.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin shook his head, smiled, and said, "Stop making such remarks. I know what you want to say."</p>

  <p>"But..." Supreme Lord Leroy was unwilling to treat Supreme Lord Korbin as an opponent. But at this moment, he just wanted to try his best to convince him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin wasn't going to give Supreme Lord Leroy any chance to escape. "But we've already made our choice!"</p>

  <p>"We?" Supreme Lord Leroy asked, his eyebrows going up as he noticed Supreme Lord Shadow's appearance. He turned to warn Luo Zheng, "Luo Zheng! Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had barely finished talking when a shadow suddenly appeared behind Luo Zheng, a black broken blade silently approaching Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was looking at Supreme Lord Shadow, but he swung his elbow backwards.</p>

  <p>This attack seemed very ordinary, but the power that Luo Zheng had poured into his elbow was terrifying. Supreme Lord Leroy had dealt with a Supreme Lord, so it was fitting enough that the one who had attacked Luo Zheng must also be a Supreme Lord. Luo Zheng looked calm, but he had used the power of nine stars.</p>

  <p>He had used thirty percent of the stars' strength.</p>

  <p>The power from the elbow strike swarmed backwards like a flood.</p>

  <p>BAM!</p>

  <p>The strike had looked ordinary but a loud sound rang out from it.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a figure appeared behind Luo Zheng, staggering in the air as the crowd watched. He finally managed to balance himself, but his face was already deathly pale. He held on for a while before he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>"What should I be careful of?" Luo Zheng asked, without looking back, a smile on his face. He couldn't even be bothered to deal with a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy stared blankly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had underestimated Zheng's strength all this time, but now, he was beginning to increasingly think highly of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he had first seen Luo Zheng, he had treated Luo Zheng as a warrior who had only just become a world lord. But on meeting him, Luo Zheng had destroyed his Fixed Vision Theurgy, which had improved his impression of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But with Zheng's subsequent performance, his opinion about Luo Zheng had quickly changed. Luo Zheng was a Godly Genius after all, and even though he had just reached the world lord realm, he was not an ordinary world lord.</p>

  <p>He was one of the top world lords, able to defeat any martial artist who was weaker than grand world lords.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was fighting by his side against the Faith Trial, he had once again, performed beyond Supreme Lord Leroy's expectations. Supreme Lord Leroy had believed that Luo Zheng could even be considered to be as outstanding as a powerful grand world lord. He was truly worthy of being called the number one Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>And now, Supreme Lord Leroy was discovering he was like a weak warrior without that vast of a knowledge before Luo Zheng. It was impossible for him to understand Zheng's true strength.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was a Supreme Lord after all, and he knew that one's knowledge was proportional to their strength. But a world lord caused a Supreme Lord to spit out blood with a casual strike? He had never heard of this sort of thing!</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord Korbin was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin believed that he was slightly stronger than Supreme Lord Shadow, which was why he had let Supreme Lord Shadow deal with Luo Zheng while he fought Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>Since Supreme Lord Shadow was very powerful, it would be easy for him to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the scene before him confused Supreme Lord Korbin. A hint of doubt arose within him. Was Supreme Lord Shadow just pretending to do that? Even if he was just putting on a show, he needed Zheng's cooperation. But Luo Zheng looked so pleased and arrogant that it was obvious he was suppressing Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>The number of the Demon Night members gathering around the Inauguration Altar increased. Aside from the weaker pilgrims, the world lords of the Board of Elders in the sacred places had also gathered. These elders were all anxious as they saw the two Supreme Lords take action against Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>The members of the Board of Elders were mostly on Supreme Lord Leroy's side. They had been suppressed by Yao for so many years and had hated her from the bottom of their hearts. But the members of the Demon Night did not want the warriors of their race to kill each other, which was why the elders had come there to mediate in the dispute.</p>

  <p>But before they had the chance to speak, they saw something that shocked them to no end.</p>

  <p>"That young man is definitely Luo Zheng! He has even made Supreme Lord Shadow spit out blood with just one punch! How did he do that?" An elder asked, his eyes wide with surprise and confusion.</p>

  <p>"You're asking me? I have no idea either!" The other elder was stunned as well.</p>
