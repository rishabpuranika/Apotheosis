<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even if Supreme Lord Amritpal released his hottest flames, the rate at which the Yellow Sand Star burned had slowed down.</p>

  <p>This star's surface was only soft sand and underneath was ten miles of soil.</p>

  <p>Beneath the soil was a layer of hard rock, under which lay the mantle.</p>

  <p>The mantle was made of tougher stuff than normal rock and encased the very core of the star.</p>

  <p>A star's core was extremely sturdy and its weight was equally astonishing. A palm-sized core was equal to the weight of an entire mountain.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Supreme Lord Amritpal's flames to burn the entire star out in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"Leave the Crown of Destiny to me. There is someone in my clan who urgently needs it,"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Myles said, taking advantage of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Someone in your clan needs it? Are you joking? You're not the only one who needs the Crown of Destiny!" a Supreme Lord protested.</p>

  <p>It was a fact that there were many world lords in this boundless universe but too few Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Nearly twenty Supreme Lords had arrived, and Zheng's use of the Roaring Token was only going to invite more. A huge problem had now posed itself: who took ownership of the Crown of Destiny?</p>

  <p>It was not something that could be halved, nor could it be shredded into pieces for distribution.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You greedy guys! All you think about is this Crown of Destiny, but none of you has ever considered the most important thing! This is the 129th Crown of Destiny. If there really is someone who carries the Heavenly Destiny, then has any of you thought about what would happen?" another Supreme Lord asked in a clear voice.</p>

  <p>His words plunged everyone into silence.</p>

  <p>A single round of heavens could only carry 128 Heavenly Destinies. This number had always been constant.</p>

  <p>What would happen with the emergence of the 129th? Nobody knew.</p>

  <p>Would it perhaps trigger the collapse of heavens? Would it end this grand era so suddenly? The risks were numerous and too heavy to even start comprehending.</p>

  <p>The silence was heavy among these mighty Supreme Lords, and it was only broken by the appearance of another one of their ranks. "Ranell!</p>

  <p>You've finally come!" Supreme Lord Addison greeted.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Addison had been the first one to arrive, but the arrival of so many others had pushed him to the very edge of the crowd.</p>

  <p>He was one of the oldest Supreme Lords, yet prestige was not determined by age but by the Heavenly Destiny. The power of the Law of Causality contained within a Heavenly Destiny was directly proportional to the strength of a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Addison's Heavenly Destiny was not particularly amazing and was considered as one of the weakest out of all Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, the expressions of all other Supreme Lords present changed the moment they heard the name "Ranell."</p>

  <p>This newcomer was not only the second-ranked Supreme Lord among all ogres, but he was also a mid-rank Supreme Lord with incomparable fierceness. It could be said that his strength was on par with both Supreme Lord Myles and Supreme Lord Amritpal, maybe even stronger.</p>

  <p>He was the third mid-rank Supreme Lord to have made his appearance before the Yellow Sand Star.</p>

  <p>In his arrival, he brought with him thousands of densely packed, skeleton-like shadows that constantly gnawed at his back.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that these skeleton-like shadows were no match to his protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Ranell, why are there so many skeletons behind your back?" Supreme Lord Addison asked as he gave the skeletons a strange look.</p>

  <p>"I encountered the Shadow Race when I rushed over here," Supreme Lord Ranell replied with a somewhat angry expression. "They were extremely persistent and dared to actually chase after me. I killed quite a few of them!"</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Race actually dared to chase after you?" Supreme Lord Addison asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The reactions of the other Supreme Lords were of similar puzzlement.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Race was extremely troublesome and no Supreme Lord had any desire to provoke any of them. It was not because they feared them, but because the members of this race released these persistent skeletons upon their death.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to get rid of these skeletons. They would latch onto their target and constantly bite him or her.</p>

  <p>It was essentially the curse of a dying Shadow Race member, one that would last for several years.</p>

  <p>A skeleton's bite was nothing to a Supreme Lord, but it was extremely annoying.</p>

  <p>Still, Supreme Lord Ranell's predicament was only a momentary distraction. The main issue here was the Yellow Sand Star that was currently burning in front of them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the fairy palace, Zheng was currently passing by the time.</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Sand Star is getting smaller and smaller," he mumbled, revealing a trace of worry on his face. If this went on, he would have nowhere to hide anymore.</p>

  <p>Saul's face maintained a deadpan expression, not really particularly worried about their current situation. "Transforming the fairy palace into a stone was still too eye-catching. I shall turn it into a grain of sand instead!" he declared and instantly transformed the stone into a minuscule grain of sand that immediately fused into the star core.</p>

  <p>Outside, the Supreme Lords continued arguing amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>Despite being warriors of might, they were no different from ordinary mortals when it came to furthering their own agendas. Everyone was on high alert as the matter of ownership of the Crown of Destiny hung tensely over their heads.</p>

  <p>If it ever came to it, a fight to the death was highly possible.</p>

  <p>But for now, they could only wait for the entire star to burn out before making their move.</p>

  <p>A bead of sweat ran down Supreme Lord Amritpal's temple as he looked at the burning star. With a wave of his hand, a fire dragon once again appeared in his hand. He immediately threw it onto the burning star and watched as it assimilated with the fire dragon from before, increasing its firepower by twofold.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Amritpal, I'm here to lend you a hand," another Supreme Lord offered.</p>

  <p>Almost every Supreme Lord had completely comprehended the Original Laws of the universe, and even those who did not necessarily practice fire-attribute cultivation methods were still far superior to ordinary warriors in terms of the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion as more power was poured into the fire dragon, greatly strengthening its flames.</p>

  <p>The joint forces of the Supreme Lords helped burn the star much faster.</p>

  <p>The rate at which it shrank was even visible to them.</p>

  <p>A thousand miles in diameter...</p>

  <p>Eight hundred miles in diameter...</p>

  <p>A hundred miles in diameter...</p>

  <p>The initial layers had been burned away, leaving behind a solid glazed substance that was similar to hot, molten metal.</p>

  <p>Ten miles in diameter...</p>

  <p>One mile...</p>

  <p>A thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Finally, the star core made its appearance. The 80, 000-mile diameter Yellow Sand Star was no more. All that remained now was this small core which was the size of a person's fist.</p>

  <p>The sight of this black object made the Supreme Lords' faces fall.</p>

  <p>"Where is the mini fairy palace?"</p>

  <p>"He couldn't have possibly escaped, right? Did he run away through spatial transference? That's not possible! We would've seen it if he did!"</p>

  <p>Questions ran through each of the Supreme Lords' minds but none of them could comprehend just how the small fairy palace suddenly disappeared right under their very noses. Perhaps it was in this fist-sized, black star core?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Amritpal extended a hand and made a few calculations with his fingers. "Continue to burn the star core!" he declared with a cold sneer. "The fairy palace is truly very interesting! It is actually hiding inside the very core itself."</p>

  <p>And he was right. The mini fairy palace had turned into a grain of sand that had drilled itself into the very center of this impossibly hard star core.</p>

  <p>And as long as Supreme Lord Amritpal continued with his incineration, then the mini fairy palace would eventually be exposed.</p>

  <p>There was another huge burst of flames as the star core was once again set alight by the Supreme Lords. From the size of a fist, it shrank down to the size of a pebble, until it finally vanished and left behind a grain of sand that slowly rotated in the air.</p>
