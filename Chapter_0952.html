  <p>It was the boy from the pasture, Craig.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had first arrived at the Sea God Continent, none of the herdsmen had dared to resist the ogres, but this boy, Craig, had stood bravely next to him, showing his determination to fight against the enemy.</p>

  <p>Given his strength, Craig wouldn't stand a chance, but it took a lot of courage to stand his ground knowing that the outcome would be bad for him. He was the only one who had dared to take a step forward while all the other humans stood to one side and trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>Now, Craig couldn't tell the cultivation levels of the people in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was said that war fighters could fly in the air, so they must be stronger than war fighters. However, Craig also knew that his guess wasn't accurate.</p>

  <p>His nomadic tribe had war fighters, but their auras weren't anywhere near as strong as the auras of the people in front of him.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps even the weakest of them are war generals, ' Craig thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He rushed forward with his sparkling eyes fixed firmly on Luo Luo Zheng and knelt on the ground. "I-I'm a martial artist now. Please, please accept me as your disciple!"</p>

  <p>Craig's sincere request caused all of the top-level war lords present, including Miguel and Amber, to laugh. In their eyes, this human boy was simple and adorable.</p>

  <p>Hearing Craig's request, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "I'm sorry. I don't accept disciples. What's more, I'm about to leave this place. Your cultivation is too low for you to be able to pass through the long-distance transmission array."</p>

  <p>However, Craig was more persistent than Luo Luo Zheng had imagined. Still kneeling, he said, "I'll follow you even if I have to risk my life."</p>

  <p>"Ho-ho, this boy is so determined!" a top-level war lord said.</p>

  <p>Craig had actually already begged Luo Luo Zheng to accept him as his disciple when Luo Luo Zheng had first arrived at the Sea God Continent, but Luo Luo Zheng had refused at that time. And now, in the situation he was in, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't establish his own clan, let alone accept disciples. Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to refuse Craig once again.</p>

  <p>But Craig seemed to have no intention of standing up until his request was accepted.</p>

  <p>At this moment, one of the top-level war lords of the human race said to Craig, "Clearly, he doesn't want to accept you as his disciple. How about being my disciple instead?"</p>

  <p>Craig had just reached the bone refining level, so he didn't have the qualifications to join the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Even the simplest entrance exam would be hard for him to pass. Therefore, having a top-level war lord as his master would be considered a great honor for him.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the human top-level war lord wanted to curry favor with Luo Luo Zheng. Although Luo Luo Zheng was about to leave, he had a lot of influence in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, so there would be no harm in doing so. After all, what if Luo Luo Zheng returned to the Sea God Continent one day?</p>

  <p>Craig looked up and shook his head. "No, I only want to take the true god as my master!"</p>

  <p>The warriors all raised their eyebrows in surprise. They'd never thought that Craig would be so persistent. He wanted to be Luo Zheng's disciple so much that he wasn't even willing to accept a top-level war lord as his master.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng still shook his head. "As I said, I'm going to leave this place.</p>

  <p>Even if I accept you as my disciple, it won't do you any good."</p>

  <p>"But?" Craig looked up at Luo Luo Zheng, as if searching for the right words in his mind.</p>

  <p>Miguel laughed. "I'd like to accept you as my disciple. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>At his words, many of the top-level war lords' expressions changed. Miguel rarely accepted disciples. Even Olivia, the most outstanding talent of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, hadn't been able to become his disciple. Even if Craig improved his talent tenfold, he still wouldn't be qualified to become Miguel's disciple.</p>

  <p>Everyone had sharp eyes and had sized Craig up as soon as they'd seen him.</p>

  <p>In their view, Craig's bone refining level was not a problem. Despite having a low cultivation level, a person could make fast progress in the future as long as he was talented. After he entered the Tower of Sin, his cultivation speed would soar in no time. But Craig wasn't talented and his physical condition wasn't satisfactory. This was the biggest problem.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Miguel had just been joking when he'd asked Craig to be his disciple. He thought that since Craig was so determined, he wouldn't change his mind and take any master other than Luo Luo Zheng. After all, given Craig's cultivation level, it would be impossible for him to tell who was stronger among the people present. Miguel thought that in Craig's eyes, Miguel and the first top-level war lord had probably reached the same level.</p>

  <p>However, Miguel had underestimated Craig.</p>

  <p>Craig was crafty and observant. As soon as he heard Miguel's proposal, he hurriedly nodded. "Since the true god won't take me as his disciple, I'm willing to be your disciple instead."</p>

  <p>It was true that Craig couldn't distinguish the difference in strength between Miguel and the top-level war lord, but he was sensible and good at gauging people's thoughts. When the top-level war lord had asked Craig to be his disciple, the crowd's expressions didn't change at all. However, when this middle-aged man in a robe had asked him the same question, all of their expressions had changed. It was obvious to Craig that this man must be an extraordinary figure. But he had no idea that Miguel was the leader of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>When Craig readily agreed to Miguel's proposal, the crowd burst into hearty laughter. Amber faintly smiled and said, "Miguel, you can't go back on your word."</p>

  <p>Miguel smiled. "I definitely won't go back on my word." Then, he turned to Craig. "Being my disciple will be a tough task. You must prepare yourself for the training."</p>

  <p>If the many talents of the Purple Heart Sacred Place found out that Miguel had taken a young boy of bone refining level as his disciple because of a joke, they would probably pass out in shock and depression.</p>

  <p>In fact, Olivia, Dylon, and the others already felt like they were going to faint.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Olivia, the number one talent of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, had asked two elders to try to persuade Miguel to take her as his disciple. Out of the millions of martial artists in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, she was the martial artist with the highest talent. Even so, she'd been rejected by Miguel.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how surprised she was now.</p>

  <p>Then, over a hundred herdsmen rushed to the scene. They weren't as bold as Craig, so they came to a stop far away and kowtowed to Luo Luo Zheng. It was obvious that their gratitude to Luo Luo Zheng was sincere and devout.</p>

  <p>The supreme life vitality crystals on the massive transmission array were finally laid down. Then, a blazing white light cut the transmission array in half, forming a massive line before shooting up into the sky. The large transmission array was finally opened.</p>

  <p>"It's time to leave," Luo Luo Zheng said as Xun's figure turned into sword spirit and drilled into his body. Then, he turned around and bid farewell to everyone before stepping into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>As Olivia watched Luo Zheng's figure disappear into the blazing white light, her eyes, which were filled with tender emotions, suddenly turned red.</p>

  <p>She might have a lot of things to say to Luo Luo Zheng, but it was already an extravagant request for her to send him off at a time like this. How would she even get the opportunity to speak to him alone? Besides, even if she had an opportunity, where would she start from? Could she say that she wanted to follow Luo Luo Zheng into the transmission array? This was obviously impossible.</p>

  <p>The light of the transmission array extended all the way into the distance until it reached the horizon. It drew a parabola in the sky and finally disappeared over the horizon.</p>

  <p>Miguel looked at the light and said, "I wonder just where this transmission array will lead to."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps in the future, we may be able to enter the transmission array too,"</p>

  <p>Amber said indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent was actually a very barren continent. In terms of wealth and area, it was far from the Central Region. However, a dozen sacred places were located on that continent, while the Central Region did not have a single sacred place.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was the reason for that. It was because of the existence of the Tower of Sin and the Dark Nether Cave that there were so many sacred places in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng sped through the space channel, thoughts raced through his mind.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was his main battlefield. He had finally returned after receiving training in the Sea God Continent for almost two years.</p>
