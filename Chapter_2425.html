<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2425 Return Mikail's Skeleton </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The dark-skinned man who had been following Zheng all this time also had an outstanding performance.</p>

  <p>With his knowledge and experience, it was possible that he could pass the fifth stage of the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he still lagged behind Zheng in the fourth stage.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, huge, blood red lizards began to crawl out from the cracks in the fourth stage. They spewed out large amounts of venom in random moments. Although the tree hole in the Killing Zone was very wide, the venom swept through it like a storm.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was not afraid of the venom.</p>

  <p>The dark-skinned man, on the other hand, had no other choice but to hide.</p>

  <p>He got hit by a little bit of venom and lay paralyzed on the ground. As he lay there, the venomous lizards slowly crawled towards him.</p>

  <p>Zheng took this opportunity to turn around and use his strength source to form an invisible sharp sword, slicing the Sword Card beside the man into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the man found safety after he was enveloped by the light falling from the top of the tree hole. A fierce, bright light flashed in his eyes as he watched Zheng leave so gracefully.</p>

  <p>Along with Zheng, there were four True Gods who managed to pass the fifth stage.</p>

  <p>Among them were three top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Being able to pass the second round of screening gave them a chance to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Therefore, once they left the Killing Zone, they were in high spirits. This was a chance that many True Gods didn't even have the opportunity to see.</p>

  <p>But as usual, Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>Just then, three gray lights shot over from somewhere nearby. They were the three consummate True Gods of the Sword Clan: Bill, Ivan and Clifford.</p>

  <p>"Hello, elders!"</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods were extremely flattered seeing the three consummate True Gods of the Sword Clan at the same time.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, the three consummate True Gods didn't look at them at all. Instead, they all were hooked on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You are  Zheng Luo, right?" Bill asked Zheng, giving him a good, hard stare.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart sank in the slightest, but he nodded calmly anyway.</p>

  <p>He didn't use his alias when he came to the Sword Clan this time.</p>

  <p>This was because the Non-combat Zone was not as dangerous as he had thought for it to be.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Sword Clan had their own ways to kill, such as using the Killing Zone to cover the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>However, True Gods, other than those of the Sword Clan, did not have the ability or right to do so.</p>

  <p>Just as what Hallet had told him, the Sword Clan was a grey area. Now they were neither friends nor foes, but looking at it in the long run, it was hard to say.</p>

  <p>"Well done," said Bill. "You're a mere low-rank True God, yet you passed the Killing Zone test. Your strength is indeed powerful enough to change the rankings of the Floating Islands. Will you come with me, please?" He had an appreciative smile on his face, very genuine and kind-looking.</p>

  <p>Hearing this brought the three top-rank True Gods to shock. How could this guy alter the Floating Islands' rankings?</p>

  <p>There were many Floating Islands in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But as an elder of the Sword Clan, Bill meant the Floating Islands of powerful clans above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Who was to say that Zheng had this kind of power? He was just a low-rank True God!</p>

  <p>In the fifth stage, the three top-rank True Gods were shocked at Zheng's existence, but later when Zheng displayed his powerful strength, they respected him. In fact, one of them wouldn't even have passed if it weren't for Zheng's help.</p>

  <p>Then Bill, Clifford and Ivan were about to leave with Zheng.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods grew anxious. One of them immediately stepped forward, made a bow and said, "Dear elders, I wonder what the Sword Clan will do after we pass the Killing Zone."</p>

  <p>Bill turned his head and looked at him with a blank stare. "Just wait," he said, impatiently. "Later, somebody will come to arrange for you."</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods were very disappointed, because even if they won the opportunity to take part in the debate over the Godly Ways, they had to just wait there. At the same time, they began to discuss the origin of Zheng.</p>

  <p>After Zheng was brought into a hall of the Sword Clan, Bill turned his head and stared at Zheng. "Oh, I don't need to introduce myself, do I?"</p>

  <p>"Master Bill," Zheng greeted, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>Bill nodded and smiled, and then pointed to the two people beside him and said, "This is Clifford, and this is Ivan."</p>

  <p>"Hello, Master Clifford, Master Ivan." Zheng nodded at the both, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"So, let's get straight to the point. You have Mikail's corpse, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Ivan, being the impatient one, just wanted to get things over with. He wanted to confirm it as soon as possible, lest Bill make a mistake.</p>

  <p>After Zheng left the Time Sea Forbidden Land, he left a promise that if he had the chance, he would return Mikail's corpse.</p>

  <p>The other two were staring at Zheng eagerly, wanting to know what happened.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded. "The corpse of Master Mikail is indeed in my hands. As the saying goes, one has to revert to their origin, just as fallen leaves return to the roots. I'll give his corpse back to you now."</p>

  <p>After finishing speaking, Zheng reached out to get the jade seal and take out Mikail's skeleton.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to do so, Ivan stopped him. "Wait a minute." He still looked gloomy. "Can you tell me how Mikail died?"</p>

  <p>Killing a consummate True God was not an easy task. Even in the extremely dangerous second and third stages of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, none of the consummate True Gods had died. However, Mikail died in a small, harmless jade seal. They still couldn't find a reason or explanation for how that happened.</p>

  <p>Earlier, through other channels, they learned that almost everyone in the jade seal was killed by Zheng. They even thought Zheng killed Mikail in the first place, because he controlled the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Looking at the skeptical gazes of the men in front of him, Zheng shook his head and said, "Actually, I have to say I couldn't get the jade seal without Master Mikail's help."</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng explained what had happened before he met Mikail.</p>

  <p>Once he finished, he waved his hand and a colorful ray of light flashed on the ground before him. He took a step onto it.</p>

  <p>Back in the world of the jade seal, Zheng flashed and arrived at a corner of the desert.</p>

  <p>Mikail's skeleton, which was stabbed by the Spear of Time, was lying alone in the windy, gloomy desert.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and with a light wave, the skeleton flew right over with him. He then took the skeleton back to the Sword Clan through the time path.</p>

  <p>"Is this... Is this Mikail's skeleton?" The faces of Clifford and Bill fell to the ground. They were speechless at the sight of the corpse.</p>

  <p>Ivan took a deep breath. The surface of the skeleton was covered with spots and cracks, as if Mikail died many years ago.</p>

  <p>Given Mikail's cultivation, his corpse would have undergone a long period of time before it gradually became decadent. Why did it look so rotten after only a few years?</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was hit by a Spear of Time," said Zheng. "I entered the world of the jade seal a little later than Master Mikail, and when I met him, he had become what he is now." Zheng wanted to be as honest as possible. Seeing that Ivan was indistinctly doubtful, he continued on to explain, "If you don't believe me, you can try to inquire about Troy's injury. He was also unexpectedly stabbed by a Spear of Time. When I met Master Mikail, I took three Space-striking Rings from his hand. If it weren't for these rings, I wouldn't have gotten this jade seal in the first place."</p>

  <p>The three consummate True Gods looked at Mikail's right hand. As the highest honor of the Sword Clan, the Space-striking Ring was indeed something that they had to take with them all the time. As Zheng had said, the rings were gone from Mikail's fingers.</p>
