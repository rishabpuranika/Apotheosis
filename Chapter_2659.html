<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slashed the sword in front of him with practiced ease, leaving a barely noticeable mark on the wall.</p>

  <p>The house groaned, and a second later, collapsed with a deafening sound.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as fierce as Luo Zheng's sword was, it was unable to hurt the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng weighed the sword in his hand, face solemn.</p>

  <p>Everyone became ordinary under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, and in theory, Luo Zheng would be mostly unrivaled under this condition.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect the tomb keeper's body to be this tough. Even if he utilized the Truth Crystal, he still couldn't do anything to the tomb keeper and it was frustrating him to no end.</p>

  <p>"Let's make a deal," said the tomb keeper as he dexterously spun the dagger in his hand. "If I defeat you, you'll tell me how you cultivated the truth theurgy. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The sudden proposal puzzled Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He thought the tomb keeper would be on the Warden race's side but judging from his attitude, it looked like he didn't really care much whether the race lived or died.</p>

  <p>"I have no time for such nonsense." Luo Zheng extended his arm and with a slight turn of the Truth Crystal in his palm, starlight shone down the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>Not a second after, Luo Zheng darted towards the tomb keeper, his sword enveloped in a green light.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper took half a step back, as cool and indifferent as ever.</p>

  <p>This was how he moved, calculated and precise.</p>

  <p>He didn't blink once as the starlight hit his body.</p>

  <p>And as Luo Zheng's sword came at him, he merely tilted his head, narrowly missing a gash on the neck.</p>

  <p>His movements looked like dancing. Any carelessness would lead him to death.</p>

  <p>He moved leisurely, as if he was waltzing and not fighting to the death. It irked Luo Zheng but he guessed it would be good for him if the tomb keeper made a wrong step.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, Luo Zheng could easily claim victory by using the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper, however, only had his experience to rely on. 'He must have perfect perception of energy, ' thought Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Watching his opponent's fluid body movement secretly frightened Luo Zheng, prompting him to make fiercer and stronger attacks.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Three beams of starlight fell on the tomb keeper's head.</p>

  <p>His body twisted slightly, barely dodging the light beams. He lifted his dagger and hacked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thrust his long sword just in time, stabbing at the tomb keeper multiple times.</p>

  <p>He aimed his strikes where the vital organs would be but the tomb keeper remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's sword strikes were random, the tomb keeper could still make accurate judgments.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to tell me, huh? Looks like I have no choice but to force it out of you!" the tomb keeper said as he constantly dodged Luo Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swung his sword at the tomb keeper but the body of the tomb keeper was like a willow, avoiding Luo Zheng's attacks with ease.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper then came forward and hit Luo Zheng's wrist with his dagger's hilt.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>Having lost his weapon, Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and once again summoned a beam of starlight, smashing it down the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper's eyes gleamed as he quickly moved behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He grabbed Luo Zheng's neck and pushed him forward, right below the falling starlight. "Say it," he said.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the starlight was about to hit Luo Zheng's head, the tomb keeper suddenly pulled him back.</p>

  <p>Cold sweat rolled down Luo Zheng's forehead.</p>

  <p>Just now, his life had been entirely under the control of the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>If the tomb keeper hadn't pulled him back, he most likely would have been killed by his own starlight.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did not intend to give up.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was upright, he turned around and pushed his elbow towards the tomb keeper's face.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper's mouth curled in growing annoyance. He maneuvered his body to dodge Luo Zheng's elbow as his hands snaked up Luo Zheng's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's arms were dislocated and drooped feebly with two crisp sounds.</p>

  <p>"Still want to do this?" the tomb keeper asked again.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his leg and kicked towards the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper avoided the kick and with a light tap, dislocated Luo Zheng's legs as well. Luo Zheng's knees buckled and he fell face-first on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lay down, gasping for breath. He was helpless.</p>

  <p>Never had he been defeated by someone with the same strength as him.</p>

  <p>It had almost been impossible for Emily to defeat him under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>But the tomb keeper dominated him easily.</p>

  <p>"Actually, I can guess even if you don't say it," said the tomb keeper, as he looked down at Luo Zheng. "You learned the truth theurgy from Othniel. I went to see him when he just came to this world, but he didn't talk to me."</p>

  <p>"Othniel?" Luo Zheng's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had never called its master by his name. It looked like its master was called Othniel.</p>

  <p>"Countless top figures in the Source World scrambled for the truth theurgy, and they went to great lengths to obtain it. Some of them even had the delusion to create the Divine Dao Great Unity, but in the end, they still got nothing. But why did he choose you?" Curiosity and annoyance laced the tomb keeper's voice.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper had visited Othniel in the hope that he could learn the truth theurgy, only to be disappointed.</p>

  <p>In fact, the reason why the tomb keeper stayed here was that he wanted to obtain the Truth Godly Way. It was why he made that bet with Herbert.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the tomb keeper, as a top-rank True God, Luo Zheng was indeed outstanding enough.</p>

  <p>However, he had seen many True Gods as outstanding as Luo Zheng. There were, after all, too many powerful True Gods in the Source World.</p>

  <p>And if he was being honest, Luo Zheng wasn't anywhere near the top ten.</p>

  <p>But why was it that Luo Zheng got the truth theurgy without much effort when he had spent countless hours and energy trying to learn it, only to fail every time?</p>

  <p>"Tell me why he chose you," the tomb keeper continued, his eyes never straying from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only turned his head aside.</p>

  <p>"I have a way to make you speak," the tomb keeper said.</p>

  <p>But just as the tomb keeper pressed on Luo Zheng harder, a loud whirring sound suddenly came from far away.</p>

  <p>When the tomb keeper heard this, he looked up at the Equality Altar and frowned.</p>

  <p>Why did the Warden race deactivate the Strength Equalizing Theurgy now? Were they playing with death?</p>

  <p>It was already difficult to fight against the intruders under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy. Just imagine how it would be with the Strength Equalizing Theurgy gone.</p>

  <p>As the Equality Altar rotated slowly, it emitted dots of orange light which began to spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>Activating the Strength Equalizing Theurgy was a process that moved from inside to outside and from slow to fast.</p>

  <p>Deactivating it was the same.</p>

  <p>Spark, who was standing in the center of the Equality Altar, was the first to be infiltrated by the orange light.</p>

  <p>When his cultivation base was restored, a sinister smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the group of people not far from the altar were just a group of ants for him.</p>

  <p>Realizing it was his chance, he shouted, "All of you! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>His voice echoed in the sky.</p>
