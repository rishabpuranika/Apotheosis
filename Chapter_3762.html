<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng met Hosea's eyes and made a gesture with his finger. "I simply used the Sanskrit deciphering method to understand his language..."</p>

  <p>He was, of course, spouting nonsense, but it wasn't entirely baseless. There was bound to be some similarity between Sanskrit words and the bald giant's language, but the latter was definitely far more difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>However, his claims attracted Hosea's attention. "The Sanskrit deciphering method..." he repeated. Hosea's eyes shone with intrigue as he looked at Zheng. "Which civilization's rules did you use? The human civilization?"</p>

  <p>There were numerous methods in deciphering Sanskrit and every civilization developed their own. The Element Spirit Civilization once consolidated and summarized all these methods.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was human, Hosea naturally thought that he used the human civilization's rules.</p>

  <p>"Human civilization's rules?" Zheng repeated with a smile before he shook his head. "No, I found a lost Other Shore civilization in Stage Twenty-six of the Other Shore that summarized the method."</p>

  <p>Thus began Zheng's long, drawn-out tale of complete, utter nonsense.</p>

  <p>All sorts of secrets were hidden on the Other Shore and not even the Element Spirit Civilization knew everything. It was not difficult for Zheng to fool Hosea with wild, elaborate, and vivid descriptions and the latter could only listen patiently.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter whether Zheng was lying or telling the truth.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, Stage Thirty was Hosea's territory. Everything was under his control here.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued his nonsensical tale, he noticed the bald giant's eyes get redder and redder while his face got even more distorted.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>To his horror, the solid ice that encased the bald giant shattered with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The bald giant's skin turned blood-red as it expanded. Infinite power burst out from his body and the ice spears that trapped him snapped one by one.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Once free from the ice seal, the bald giant stepped forward and the whole ice city began to shake.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With stunning agility, the giant's blood-red fist rushed towards Hosea's head.</p>

  <p>Hosea merely responded with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>He was an immortal water spirit and it was impossible to kill him with just brute force.</p>

  <p>When the huge fist smashed down upon him, Hosea made no move to dodge. All he needed to do was blink and the bald giant would freeze once again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's eyes flashed and he finally made his move.</p>

  <p>He had the triangular Earth Wood Seal imprinted on his palm and the distance between him and his target was only ten feet.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He took a step forward and was able to bridge the gap between him and Hosea.</p>

  <p>Hosea turned around with a look of confusion on his face.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was due to his arrogance that he did not think for a second that Zheng would be able to hurt him. Instead of dodging, Hosea merely sneered at the oncoming attack.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he saw the imprint on Zheng's palm, he froze.</p>

  <p>The Earth Wood Seal?</p>

  <p>There was no way that a water spirit like him wouldn't know what that was.</p>

  <p>This seal had taken countless water spirits' lives!</p>

  <p>How in the world could it be here in Stage Thirty, his domain?</p>

  <p>Just as Hosea came to a sinking realization, it was already too late for him to dodge. Zheng's palm had already landed on his back and imprinted the Earth Wood Seal.</p>

  <p>A water spirit had the ability to morph into whatever shape he wanted.</p>

  <p>If Hosea willed it, he could integrate himself with the entirety of the ice city.</p>

  <p>In fact, it could also be said that the ice city itself was part of his body already.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the Earth Wood Seal landed on his back, his entire body turned a sick shade of brownish-yellow. The former water spirit seemingly turned into an earth spirit as tender branches began to burst out of his body layer by layer.</p>

  <p>"You, you..."</p>

  <p>In this moment of crisis, Hosea could only stutter in frustration.</p>

  <p>He was unable to change shape because of the Earth Wood Seal and he would definitely die under this heavy blow.</p>

  <p>With rage in his eyes, Hosea let out a desperate, horrifying scream.</p>

  <p>"Let's die together then!" he shouted as he stretched out his arms and wrapped them around Zheng with branches from within his body.</p>

  <p>At the sudden barrage of branches, Zheng did his best to twist his way out.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, though the Earth Wood Seal transformed Hosea's entire constitution, it did nothing to lessen his strength.</p>

  <p>As a powerful Eternal Realm warrior, and despite the pressure of Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, Hosea's strength remained superior. There was no way Zheng could get rid of his branches at all.</p>

  <p>"You want to break away from me?" Hosea sneered.</p>

  <p>His branches wrapped around Zheng even tighter and the huge fist quickly pressed the two of them to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng grit his teeth as he struggled in vain. "I can't break free, but you seem to have overlooked something..."</p>

  <p>He paused and did not continue until they were only ten feet away from the ground. "I can exit the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Hosea was evidently struck dumb when he heard this. He had completely forgotten to use the Soul Restraining Sand on Zheng!</p>

  <p>As a result, the tightly wrapped Zheng was able to disappear!</p>

  <p>The man had already recited the Illusion Breaking Rune in advance and Hosea only had time to shout a curse before he fell into eternal darkness.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The explosion was deafening and the ground trembled under the sorrowful pounding of the bald giant. "My friend..."</p>

  <p>He could have never left the Cold Prison without Zheng's help and viewed him as a close ally.</p>

  <p>The bald giant understood the situation but couldn't take his fist back.</p>

  <p>Libby and Elizabeth, who were on the upper ice field, were struck dumb at what they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was even more distraught. To her, Zheng and Emperor Charm were already one and Zheng was the only one she could follow. To see him die this way was an extremely difficult thing to accept.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng had quietly returned to the Other Shore and heard the bald giant's sad song. He smiled and whistled low.</p>

  <p>When the bald giant saw Zheng reappear, he immediately pounded on his chest in excitement.</p>

  <p>Both Elizabeth and Libby were also wide-eyed in shock. It seemed that Zheng did not die but just withdrew in order to dodge that fatal blow.</p>

  <p>As for the Five-Element Slaves, they were, in one word, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Master Hosea is still alive!"</p>

  <p>"The stage ruler just hid himself!"</p>

  <p>"He's just waiting for a chance to give the bald giant a fatal blow!"</p>

  <p>They could not believe Hosea would die this way.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that the Blooming Jade Stage was controlled by Hosea and he held absolute authority over it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a circle of light rose from the ground and flew towards the bald giant's head. With a slight fluctuation of light, the bald giant disappeared.</p>

  <p>When a stage ruler was killed, the one who killed him would be heralded as the new stage ruler.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the circle of light signified the bald giant's new role as ruler of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Hosea's death was confirmed to the Five-Element Slaves. The entire Blooming Jade Stage was now set for a lot of changes.</p>
