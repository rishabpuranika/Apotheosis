  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey turned his head and gazed at Zheng for a long time before he separated him from the surrounding scenery.</p>

  <p>It felt surreal.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not hiding himself; he was just standing there without any disguise.</p>

  <p>"Daddy, why did you become a pillar?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have turned into a chair," Augustus laughed.</p>

  <p>Hallet said calmly, "This is the work of Truth of Cultivation Nature. It's a wonderful state. It's quite hard to describe such a state. No wonder that skeleton can turn the Sunrest Tree region into a non-fight place. The Truth of Godly Way can reach the origin of life."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as all his thoughts vanished, and the Truth of Godly Way that was emitting from his body completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Skeleton? What skeleton?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Hallet smiled, "Don't you know why the debate over the Godly Ways happens? Or you don't know the reason why Holy Mike wanted you to join the debate?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He had been used to this for so many years.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the people around him knew the truth, and only he was in a state of ignorance.</p>

  <p>Every time he asked, they would always shake their heads mysteriously and keep him in the dark. This infuriated Zheng.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng stopped asking the people. He hoped that he'd find out the truth, sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about the argument that arises due to the Godly Ways?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said after pondering for a while.</p>

  <p>Hallet nodded, "You're right!"</p>

  <p>The divine land was an independent existence in the chaos. It was like an isolated island!</p>

  <p>As more and more True Gods obtained a permanent lifespan, people started thinking about this world, such as exploration in the space, research in the field of Godly Ways, and so on.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult to go further after they had reached the end of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Except for a few people who had gotten some pages of the Truth of Godly Way, others weren't able to advance any further.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and the consummate True Gods were able to comprehend that there was indeed a vast world after the Godly Way, the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The True Gods pondered over the ways which could help them cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the debate over the Godly Ways was to solve those problems that were passed down in the past countless divine eras.</p>

  <p>Every time the debate was held, True Gods from all areas of the divine land would participate. Some people would bring all kinds of golden Sanskrit words with them.</p>

  <p>During the debate, the True Gods would share their views and opinions about the world, express their speculations and their novel comprehension about the Godly Ways, argue with each other, and even criticize one another as the debate became heated.</p>

  <p>Their ultimate goal was to find a breakthrough for the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Hearing Hallet's words, Zheng enquired, "What does that have to do with the skeleton?"</p>

  <p>Hallet said with a slight smile, "As the Sunrest Tree grew, it got attached to the skeleton. It became a place of non-fight because the Truth of Godly Way emitted from the skeleton makes sure that nobody is able to fight when they are there. Not even Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"Can the Truth of Godly Way possessed by a skeleton do that?" Zheng was dumbfounded. His jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>Hallet nodded.</p>

  <p>"How powerful is that skeleton? How come its Truth of Godly Way is so terrifying?" Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>Some Godly Ways could also make a warrior acquire a very strong and unique aura.</p>

  <p>For example, Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>The True God who mastered the Great Dominance Technique dominated the area they were in. Everyone who was affected by the Great Dominance Technique would succumb to the wishes of the True God who cultivated it.</p>

  <p>The owner of the skeleton on the Sunrest Tree had died many years ago, but not even a Holy Being could cause any harm to it, while it was attached to the tree.</p>

  <p>Considering this, when the owner was alive, he or she would have been so powerful.</p>

  <p>Hallet smiled and replied, "It's just a guess, but I've already defined the cultivation base of the owner of the skeleton. I'm afraid that that person had already taken the Truth Boat and crossed the boundless Sea of Truth before death."</p>

  <p>"Crossed the Sea of Truth?" A trace of yearning appeared in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Although he had chanted eight thousand words of Truth of Godly Way and comprehended eighty percent of this mind method, he hadn't set off in the Sea of Truth yet.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that person crossed the Sea of Truth and was able to reach the other shore," said Hallet indifferently. "It was a powerful Other Shore Realm warrior."</p>

  <p>"Other Shore Realm!" Zheng's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Was it an extraordinary creature?"</p>

  <p>Hallet shook his head. "It's not certain yet. But for many divine eras, the Sword Clan has worshipped it as a sacred item. Even they might not be able to find out the origin of this skeleton. That's why they called for the entire divine land to debate over the Godly Ways. The Sword Clan is probably the group that is most interested in the Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, "I wasn't aware of that."</p>

  <p>"This time, the debate might be different from the previous ones, especially for you. The Truth of Godly Way Geoffrey deciphered is just too timely for you," Hallet said lightly.</p>

  <p>"Are you and Gus not going?" Zheng enquired.</p>

  <p>Embarrassed, Augustus curled up and didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"That's not my concern. My aim is to help that idiot control the Swirl Forest," Hallet said, pointing at Augustus who wasn't far away.</p>

  <p>Augustus looked irritated. "Stop calling me idiot!"</p>

  <p>Hallet ignored him.</p>

  <p>"Control the Swirl Forest? Just the two of you?" Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no knowledge of how to control a forbidden land, let alone the Swirl Forest which was a sixth-grade forbidden land. Without the help of Holy Beings, it would be an uphill task for Hallet and Augustus to control the forbidden land, no matter how powerful of a duo they were.</p>

  <p>"It's indeed quite difficult," said Hallet, shrugging his shoulders. "But our master had already thought of a way to deal with it." He pointed to the ground of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Are you referring to the thing that is buried underground? Is it enough to help you control the Swirl Forest?"</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly recalled how he had attracted a herd of fierce beasts from the Swirl Forest, when he removed the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace. It seemed as if there was something under the fairy palace that strongly attracted the beasts towards it.</p>

  <p>"You know about it?" Hearing this, Hallet was shocked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Saul told me," Zheng confirmed, "but what's buried underneath?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>"Well, you will know about it when it is time," Hallet said with a chuckle, with no intention of unveiling the mystery.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes and dropped the topic. He continued to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way, preparing for the debate over the Godly Ways which would take place in two years.</p>

  <p>After playing with Augustus' puppet for a while, Geoffrey got bored and entered the gourd that Hallet gave him.</p>

  <p>A huge world existed inside the gourd, filled with all sorts of things, including martial arts and inheritance. Geoffrey occasionally jumped out of the gourd to inform Yudie that he was safe. Most of the time, he was wandering in the world of the gourd.</p>

  <p>This gourd was an extremely valuable treasure for cultivation. In the next two years, his cultivation base had increased rapidly. It had only taken him four months to reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm from Internal Elixir Realm, and another six months to reach the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>His cultivation base was catching up to Yudie's!</p>

  <p>Joy had been out once during these two years to inquire about news on the Floating Islands. When she heard about the Purple Soul Hall being dissolved, she was distraught. After all, it was her fruit of painstaking efforts. She had gone all out to make things better, but in the end, all her efforts were in vain after she got injured.</p>

  <p>However, Joy was very pleased with what Hallet had to say.</p>

  <p>During these two years, Hallet and Augustus would occasionally stay inside the fairy palace to learn the Truth of Godly Way, but mostly, they went in and out of the fairy palace, busying with something else. Every time they entered the fairy palace, Hallet would have one more light golden fish line on his fish rod. He would tie the fish line to the pavilion in the fairy palace, and then would leave with Augustus.</p>

  <p>The other end of the fish line was tied somewhere in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>When Zheng asked its exact location, Augustus would only give a goofy grin. Frustrated, Zheng simply stopped asking.</p>

  <p>To the True Gods, two years was as short as the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Snow was swirling in the west of the divine land.</p>

  <p>With the cold winter wind howling, the most magnificent debate over Godly Ways was about to commence in the Sunrest Tree. Most of the True Gods anticipated that this year's debate would prove as fruitless as the previous ones. But suddenly, things took an unexpected turn.</p>
