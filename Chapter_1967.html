<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1967 Resist With Ease </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he saw Master Feng's finger, Luo Luo Zheng realized that it was a test. So he turned over his palm and blocked lightly, instantly pushing out a vigorous force.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, Master Feng changed his hand's move? he put his index finger and thumb together and with a flick, an intangible force shot out towards Luo Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't evade at all and continued blocking with his palm. But the power within his palm grew stronger and stronger to the point where he made no sign of retreat.</p>

  <p>The two sparred with each other with one hand each. In about ten seconds, they had already exchanged at least a hundred moves.</p>

  <p>When the several Supreme Lords of the Celestial Position race saw Luo Zheng's performance, they all smiled with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>It was nothing short of a miracle that a Godly Genius at the Spirit Supreme Realm could advance to such a level after cultivating in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for only three years.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, time is still too short. If we give them another hundred years, the Sacred race would flee without a fight," Supreme Lord Mirage of the Celestial Position said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Supreme Mirage was pessimistic. Although Luo Zheng's return brought vigor and confidence back into the hearts of all in the universe, to the real insiders, the situation wasn't exactly for the good of all.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses had returned, but they were only considered world lords.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Godly Geniuses were far stronger than those of the same level, but at most, they could only contend against a grand world lord and weren't strong enough to face a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords and True Gods of the two universes were those who truly decided the fight's victory or defeat.</p>

  <p>As the Godly Geniuses had just broken through and become world lords, it would still take them much effort to condense Godly Tiles and become True Gods.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Godly Geniuses' return didn't change the situation.</p>

  <p>And Luo Zheng's 'war declaration' was likely to enrage the Sacred race. By the looks of things, an all-out war was nearing reality.</p>

  <p>By merely launching strikes with his hand, Master Feng had tested Luo Zheng's strength and skills. Since he only used about ten percent of his strength against Luo Luo Zheng, the latter's cultivation base was enough for him to successfully resist Master Feng's attacks. He could be considered truly excellent.</p>

  <p>But the several Supreme Lords present had no clue that Luo Luo Zheng made use of a mere fraction of his strength.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he used only the power within his physical body to deal with Master Feng, and yet, he already had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng threw a punch that landed on the edge of Master Feng's palm, forcing the latter to back a foot away.</p>

  <p>"That's not bad." Though Master Feng wanted to test Luo Zheng's true strength, he wasn't one to admit defeat. When he didn't see any sign of exhaustion on Luo Luo Zheng, he took a few steps back and said, "Be careful. I'll use thirty percent of my strength this time!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Master Feng's words, the Supreme Lords' eyes flashed in shock.</p>

  <p>Although Master Feng wasn't very skilled at body refining, he was one of the strongest Supreme Lords in the universe, attributing to how his physical body's strength was outstandingly more powerful among the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>According to him, he previously hadn't been able to figure out Luo Zheng's true strength. And now he wanted to test Luo Zheng's strength against thirty percent of his own?</p>

  <p>Could he truly... bear it?</p>

  <p>Worry filled the hearts of the Supreme Lords? even though Luo Zheng's body was strong, he was still a junior in their eyes. In the end, he was just a world lord which in the entirety of the universe, wasn't all that powerful.</p>

  <p>Thirty percent of Master Feng's strength was released and his originally small, shriveled body suddenly swelled up.</p>

  <p>While his face remained old and withered, Master Feng's skinny frame grew muscular. To the warriors of Master Feng's level, changing their appearance was a mere matter of thought. But most martial artists felt it unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"The strength has increased three-fold." Luo Zheng's expression remained calm.</p>

  <p>He himself had tripled his strength and it was just barely enough to suppress Master Feng. But this time, Luo Luo Zheng had extracted a portion of the power from the Eight Path Platforms.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>With their strength increased three times over, their attacks also grew twice as fast.</p>

  <p>Their right hands continued moving in the air as they sparred with each other? they changed and withdrew some moves, skillfully made use of the knack, employed their hidden strength, and dissipated power.</p>

  <p>The more they fought, the greater Master Feng's shock grew.</p>

  <p>Even though he had already used thirty percent of his strength, Luo Luo Zheng resisted his strikes with ease.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage was also stunned silent, only staring at Luo Luo Zheng blankly. Seeing how easily he dealt with Master Feng, he guessed that Luo Zheng's actual strength could reach at least half of the former's.</p>

  <p>And the other Supreme Lords were just surprised.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's competitive spirit grew stronger and more riled up. He smiled boldly. "Not bad, Luo Luo Zheng. Have another try at it! This time, I'll use fifty percent of my strength! I'll also add some forceful strength to it! Be careful, now!"</p>

  <p>If earlier was just a simple test, now that Master Feng had made his move, the sparring grew closer to a real battle? he had treated Luo Luo Zheng as a real opponent.</p>

  <p>It sounded inconceivable? one of the top Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe had taken a world lord as an opponent.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Freya stood behind Luo Luo Zheng wearing varying expressions.</p>

  <p>"That old man... He seems really powerful," Ning Yudie remarked under her breath.</p>

  <p>"He's a Supreme Lord. The warriors in the hall are all Supreme Lords of the Celestial Position race," Freya explained carefully. "It would seem that Luo Luo Zheng is even stronger than I imagined."</p>

  <p>Because she stayed by Luo Zheng's side in the Upper World, she generally knew much more than Ning Yudie. Although she could see how the Supreme Lord was carefully examining Luo Luo Zheng, the latter's expression remained calm and composed all the while. Could it be that Luo Zheng's power far surpassed that of all the other Supreme Lords present?</p>

  <p>Though the thought grew loud in her mind, she didn't dare say the words aloud.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Now that Master Feng made his move, streams of azure-gray forceful strength began flowing in all directions as his moves grew fiercer.</p>

  <p>The streams of forceful strength were like sword energy as they scurried around the entire hall. Some of them shot towards two women standing not far behind Luo Luo Zheng, but with a wave of his hand, Supreme Lord Mirage obliterated the forceful strength.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng retreated a few steps, his eyes grew serious.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Eight Path Platforms in his body began slowly vibrating. They began to emanate rays of seven-colored light, which just so happened to be the color of the strength source.</p>

  <p>"Pah, pah, pah..."</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's right hand was like a bolt of lightning as it suddenly grasped Master Feng's forceful strength. Every time he made a move, he could accurately chatter the forceful strength, producing a crackling sound, loud and clear.</p>

  <p>The sound was so loud that it echoed constantly throughout the Breaking Cloud Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even Freya and Ning Yudie couldn't bear the sound, and all they could do was to cover their ears with their hands.</p>

  <p>"He broke the forceful strength with just a single hand..." Not far away, Supreme Lord Sky was muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>"This guy... resists the force with ease!" Supreme Lord Mirage's eyes were wide with disbelief? he couldn't find any words to aptly describe the scene.</p>

  <p>Now, Master Feng had used fifty percent of his strength, adding even forceful strength. If Luo Luo Zheng could withstand it, he would exceed any Supreme Lord's expectations. He was, indeed, quite outstanding.</p>

  <p>But it was clear that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't yet used his full strength? the fact had all the Supreme Lords and Master Feng embarrassed, to say the least.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Master Feng to use his full strength against a junior, after all. If he did so, the sparring could no longer be considered a test, but instead, an all-out competition.</p>
