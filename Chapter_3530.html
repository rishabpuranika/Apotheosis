  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Truth Crystal turned solid, Zheng waved his hand at it. It began to dissipate into a green eddy.</p>

  <p>Zheng gently hooked one of his fingers, then it turned into a stream of energy and dashed toward the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>There were six cracks on the surface of the seed, hence the name. The energy merged with the seed, slowly seeping through the cracks and flowing into the seed.</p>

  <p>The azure blue light of the seed gradually faded, replaced by a cyan green light. The seed now contained the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God!</p>

  <p>"The power of the bloodline is so strong." Zheng's eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed was extremely precious in the Source World. Any bloodline could be directly copied by the seed once it was absorbed. It was a truly amazing ability.</p>

  <p>"What a fascinating object!" exclaimed No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out his hand and pointed at the seed. At this, the seed promptly darted straight into his open mouth.</p>

  <p>It felt strange to swallow the seed after the bloodline had fused into it. But Zheng just followed what the Snake Goddess told him to do.</p>

  <p>At first, nothing happened after Zheng swallowed the seed. But soon, he felt a sharp pain in his stomach.</p>

  <p>Zheng could see that the seed had unfurled in his belly. In the middle of the seed, a green ball of light had started to glow. Each time a beam of light burst out, he felt a burst of sharp pain.</p>

  <p>The green light was the power of Gerald's bloodline.</p>

  <p>The power of the bloodline soon seeped into Zheng's internal organs. It flowed, almost consciously, along the meridians in his body, gathering in his chest. A small sclerite began to grow out from the area.</p>

  <p>"The second sclerite!"</p>

  <p>As No. 9527 said this, more sclerites started to grow on Zheng's chest, as more of Gerald's bloodline gathered there.</p>

  <p>The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed allowed one to inherit all the power of the bloodline from the previous generation, just like Zheng and Yan inherited the bloodlines of Chiyou and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng was inheriting the complete power of the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline!</p>

  <p>The pain in his stomach grew more intense as the power continued to flow through his internal organs and gather at his chest. The third sclerite started to grow!</p>

  <p>The sclerites emerged one by one from Zheng's chest, down to his lower ribs.</p>

  <p>Then they started to grow at his waist.</p>

  <p>Ten sclerites.</p>

  <p>Twenty.</p>

  <p>Thirty.</p>

  <p>The sclerites started to emerge from his spine, going up until they grew around his neck.</p>

  <p>The sclerites cut through Zheng's insides, causing immense pain. But he was able to tolerate it. Through the whole ordeal, Zheng kept a poker face.</p>

  <p>A flicker of fear crossed his features, however, as the sclerites started to grow in his head.</p>

  <p>He was used to seeing strange appendages on a human body, but the head was the most vital part. An accident could cause irreversible damage. If these sclerites damaged his head, it could destroy him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. This is just what happens when you absorb a bloodline.</p>

  <p>Just remember even the bloodline of Chiyou could not hurt you, let alone these sclerites," No. 9527 said, encouragingly.</p>

  <p>He was right. Zheng once had three heads and six arms, and it did not cause any damage to his body. They grew quite naturally.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, Zheng stopped worrying. He calmed down and let the sclerites grow in his head!</p>

  <p>The sclerites grew in a manner so precise that although they cut through his flesh and skull, they avoided all the vital parts, therefore not causing any substantial damage. With Zheng's strong ability to recover, the ruptured flesh quickly healed and wrapped around the new sclerites.</p>

  <p>After the sclerites had emerged in Zheng's head, the sclerites in his arms and legs started to grow.</p>

  <p>An hour later, the green light of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed finally dimmed. The sclerites also stopped growing.</p>

  <p>"There are eight hundred and sixty-one sclerites in total,"</p>

  <p>Zheng counted, using his inner vision.</p>

  <p>He stood up and tried to move his body, but almost instantly fell to the ground. These new sclerites still felt strange and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"You'll feel better once you get used to them. These sclerites have greatly enhanced your body," No. 9527 remarked.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly remembered how, in the Chaotic Source World, Mount was so powerful, almost invincible. Even the Evil God, who had absorbed the power of many bloodlines, was unable to kill him. Mount had the power of the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, and his body was strong enough to match a warrior in the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>He was a human being on the outside, but the structure inside his body was totally different from normal people. Now Zheng was just like him!</p>

  <p>Zheng walked back and forth in the cultivation room, adjusting to his new body structure. Soon enough, he began to grow accustomed to it. He started to run and jump. He adapted very quickly. It wasn't long before he was using those sclerites as if he was born with them.</p>

  <p>"The sclerites on both sides of the stomach protect the elixir field well."</p>

  <p>"Those on the legs bring greater support, boosting the legs' power."</p>

  <p>"Interesting! These sclerites did not grow randomly, but in a way that perfectly enhanced my body."</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped moving with a satisfied look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Of course! My master is perfect. Otherwise, he would not have made it from the last chaos to this one," No. 9527 pointed out, matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>"I want to try the truth-level theurgy."</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched his arms, and the eight hundred and sixty-one new sclerites inside his body responded accordingly.</p>

  <p>The power of a single Truth Crystal was indeed not enough. But Zheng was now able to mobilize all the sclerites in his body. His entire body was filled with the bloodline from the Chaos Ancient God. He was no longer the same as before.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Before No. 9257 could stop him, Zheng already activated all the sclerites. A strange scene unfolded.</p>
