<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Cyan Tree Clan felt deeply indebted to Luo Zheng for driving away the Mo Clan. As a result, they zealously invited Luo Zheng to visit their clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng refused them firmly but politely.</p>

  <p>His original intention was to completely absorb the internal momentum of the Godly Way Tablets, then leave as soon as he achieved his goal.</p>

  <p>But he had met Lucille, and his natural instinct was to protect her.</p>

  <p>The old man of the Cyan Tree Clan understood how Luo Zheng felt and did not pester him to go with them. He led his clansmen back into the forest after they had thanked Luo Zheng sincerely.</p>

  <p>"I still want to comprehend the internal momentum inscribed on the Godly Way Tablets. Meanwhile, you can try to cultivate this Energy-gathering Poison Skill. I will send you back to the fairy palace right after I absorb the internal momentum," Luo Zheng told Lucille.</p>

  <p>Lucille nodded her head a bit then sat down cross-legged.</p>

  <p>As she looked on, the other twelve poisonous warriors started to excrete the poison as soon as they obtained the copies of Energy-gathering Poison Skill.</p>

  <p>The Life Godly Way Tablet was very tranquil. Instead of attacking people with its internal momentum, it cured any living beings that approached it.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the Cyan Wood Godly Way Tablet was more volatile in temperament, almost equally so with the Thunderstorm Godly Way Tablet. It had taken Luo Zheng a significant amount of time just to approach this Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>After five minutes, Luo Zheng had already finished the absorption of internal momentum from the Cyan Wood Godly Way Tablet and he returned to Lucille's side.</p>

  <p>Lucille was in a state of meditation...</p>

  <p>He noticed that she had expelled a large quantity of toxic miasma.</p>

  <p>When the dark brown poisonous miasma had been excreted from her body, it immediately pooled into the ground surrounding her and formed a striking black circle.</p>

  <p>The same phenomenon had also happened to the other poisoned people.</p>

  <p>'It would be best if I send her back to the fairy palace directly...' An idea suddenly popped into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It had not been long since he had left the fairy palace. If he returned now, it would not be easy for him to leave immediately.</p>

  <p>Lucille had already been to the fairy palace once. If he sent her back, Augustus and Joy would be able to take care of her needs in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The mountain token materialized in his hand the moment he thought of it. He immediately activated the token and pointed it at Lucille.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The disruption in space caused by the mountain token abruptly roused Lucille from her trance.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you..." Lucille was surprised by this turn of events.</p>

  <p>"I'll send you back to the fairy palace. Please don't resist," Luo Zheng told her softly.</p>

  <p>"But I..." Lucille hesitated.</p>

  <p>She had no time to think about the situation as she was suddenly sucked into the space channel and was transported directly to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"This guy still hasn't changed even after so many years."</p>

  <p>Lucille pouted all throughout the time that she was travelling in the space channel.</p>

  <p>Although she knew that she would be safer in the fairy palace, she would have much preferred it if she traveled through the divine land with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But as he had just sent her back without an explanation, she was naturally depressed.</p>

  <p>After he had sent Lucille back to the fairy palace, Luo Zheng smiled as he glanced at the mountain token. He returned it into his space ring before proceeding forward.</p>

  <p>He had passed through the Wind Wood Region, the Purple Light Region, the Bright Golden Region, and other small regions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had continuously used the Grand Teleportation skill to cross these regions without stopping.</p>

  <p>A few people accidentally saw Luo Zheng appear out of nowhere, but he instantly disappeared under their astonished gazes. Some divine citizens who had previous experiences with similar phenomena pointed at the place where Luo Zheng disappeared, claiming that it was a theurgy that only consummate True Gods or warriors above that level could perform.</p>

  <p>After he had passed through a number of small regions, Luo Zheng took a detour to several larger regions where there were Godly Way Tablets. It was a good opportunity to comprehend the internal momentum of the Godly Way Tablets along the way.</p>

  <p>As he headed towards the south, he made sure that he was also able to absorb the internal momentum along the way.</p>

  <p>He had found thirteen Godly Way Tablets in the span of the past twenty days. He considered it to be a good harvest in his journey.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to collect the internal momentum of all the Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>Considering his cultivation at the consummation of True God Realm, the distance he traveled in the divine land using the Grand Teleportation skill was still too short for him. If he became a Demi-holy Being, or even a Holy Being, it wouldn't be a difficult task for him to visit the three thousand Godly Way Tablets scattered throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>After he had been traveling for a month, Luo Zheng had finally arrived at the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>The Evil Ghost Region wasn't called the Evil Ghost Region in the early days.</p>

  <p>Sixty divine eras ago, the Abyss Demon Region wasn't as large as it was now. The entire Abyss Demon Region had only annexed the Red Lotus Region.</p>

  <p>As eons passed, the Abyss Demon Region's area grew larger and finally expanded into the territory of the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>Even though the inside and outside of the forbidden area were very different from each other, the forbidden area considerably affected the outside world.</p>

  <p>After the Abyss Demon Region had expanded to this area, all manner of fierce creatures continuously appeared. Even some living beings who were naturally mild and peaceful had become increasingly ferocious.</p>

  <p>This was how the area gained its name - the "Evil Ghost Region".</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng directly crossed the border of the neighboring large region into the area of the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>As soon as he set foot into this area...</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Just a short distance above Luo Zheng's head, a monster with a human head and the body of an eagle laughed horribly. It opened its bloody maw wide and swooped upon Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed, and a bolt of lightning streaked through the air and struck the human-headed eagle monster.</p>

  <p>Only after he had already killed the monster did Luo Zheng realize that it might have been a bit inappropriate for him to do so.</p>

  <p>After the last Grand Teleportation, he had landed in a large canyon. On both ends of this canyon were countless human-headed eagle-bodied monsters, squatting on either side of the canyon.</p>

  <p>The resounding roar of the thunder echoed through the valley and immediately alarmed these monsters.</p>

  <p>The valley was silent for only a few seconds, before all the human-headed eagle-bodied monsters spread their wings as one and rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The monsters screeched as one, their strange and horrible laughter resounding throughout the canyon.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>"Caw! Caw! Caw..."</p>

  <p>Sensing that he was in trouble, Luo Zheng shook his head slightly. He activated the Grand Teleportation and disappeared from the canyon.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil Ghost Region seemed to deserve its reputation.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng moved to a new location, he met another kind of monster. This time, it was a kid of butterfly with a ghost face on its wings.</p>

  <p>He had killed some of the butterflies with his Thunderstorm Godly Way, but eventually, he had no choice but to teleport again.</p>

  <p>After a few unpleasant encounters, Luo Zheng finally reached the eastern area of the Evil Ghost Region. This was where the border of the Evil Ghost Region and the Abyss Demon Region was located.</p>

  <p>"This is the Abyss Demon Region." As he floated in midair, Luo Zheng could only stare blankly at the scene before him.</p>

  <p>There was a huge crater in front of him.</p>

  <p>The deep crater seemed endless, its borders extending farther than the eyes could see. After all, the entire Abyss Demon Region had annexed several large regions.</p>

  <p>This scene was familiar to Luo Zheng as he had seen it before through the Stone Mouse, but it shocked him more when he saw the scene with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Dark green smoke rose up from the bottom of the abyss, permeating everywhere.</p>

  <p>Although the space in the forbidden area had been sealed, his nostrils were still invaded by the pungent smell of sulfur contained in the smoke...</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The edge of the deep crater kept collapsing inwards.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was still expanding at an alarming rate, continuously eroding the land of the Evil Ghost Region. If it kept up such speed, it would completely engulf the Evil Ghost Region in a few divine eras.</p>

  <p>Some people had even dared to predict that if the expansion of the Abyss Demon Region would continue uncontrollably, it would completely occupy the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around him and found himself in a bit of a dilemma.</p>

  <p>The corpse of the Stone Mouse only gave him a vague picture of the place. Logically speaking, he had already reached his destination, but where could he find the Stone Mouse after it was reincarnated?</p>
