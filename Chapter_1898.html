<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This mirror was like a huge lake made of mercury, and it lay horizontally in front of Luo Luo Zheng, blocking his path.</p>

  <p>He approached the huge mirror slowly and cautiously, not knowing what to expect.</p>

  <p>He saw an identical image of himself in the mirror, slowly approaching him too.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extended his hand with some uncertainty and gently pressed the mirror. A ripple immediately appeared where his fingertip touched it and spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>"This is really a mercury lake!"</p>

  <p>He remained standing where he was, not wanting to act rashly.</p>

  <p>If his guess was correct, this would be the entrance to the interior world that Kaydan had mentioned.</p>

  <p>He had no knowledge about the so-called exterior or interior world, so he decided to wait for the aboriginals to arrive before doing anything further.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng approached the mirror, the cold flame poison disappeared completely and the temperature within his inner world began to rise rapidly. Under his control, the storm within his body calmed down, and the nine stars in his body gradually stopped circulating.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng continued to drive the nine stars to circulate, they would release a strong amount of heat, which might burn all the living beings in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Just when Luo Luo Zheng was trying to restore his inner world to normalcy, he suddenly discovered that there seemed to be something on the chaotic sea!</p>

  <p>"Runes?"</p>

  <p>He froze.</p>

  <p>When he rushed along the way, he had seen a path formed by runes before him. As he continued onward, the path disappeared behind him?</p>

  <p>Looking back, the runes had already completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng's mind was frozen by the cold temperature and he was in no mood to examine them carefully.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that these runes, which stretched thousands of miles, were already imprinted on the chaotic sea!</p>

  <p>"Are these runes the profound mysteries of Holy Jay?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng focused his gaze on the densely-packed runes. This layer of runes stretched out thousands of miles and the strip circled on the chaotic sea, undulating on the surface of the water!</p>

  <p>The characters of the runes were somewhat similar to the Sanskrit words that Luo Luo Zheng had seen before!</p>

  <p>There were many types of Sanskrit. Some Buddhist classics were also recorded in Sanskrit. But Luo Luo Zheng had only seen three types of Sanskrit that were similar to the runes on the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The first type was the Sanskrit that appeared on Luo Zheng's body, which was also the language in which the Grand Weapon Refining Method was recorded. He was familiar with this type of Sanskrit, having seen it many times before. Each time his body was tempered by the preternatural flame, the golden Sanskrit characters would appear on his body.</p>

  <p>As for the second type of Sanskrit, he had seen it when Xenia had employed her full strength?</p>

  <p>However, both these types of Sanskrit were very similar, almost identical, but the arrangement and content of each word were different.</p>

  <p>The main thing was that Luo Luo Zheng had never come into contact with this kind of culture, so he naturally couldn't read it.</p>

  <p>The runes that were before Luo Luo Zheng now had a similar shape to the first two types of Sanskrit. However, their style was completely different from that of the other types, as if they were lacking a special quality.</p>

  <p>'Yes, these three types of Sanskrit must originate from the same culture.</p>

  <p>Earlier, I didn't have the time to examine them closely, but now, it seems that these runes might be a type of Sanskrit. And the difference is that these three types of Sanskrit were written by different people?' Luo Luo Zheng ruminated.</p>

  <p>Each person had their own style of writing. The same sentence, when written by different people, would look different because of the handwriting. Some people had a lively style of penmanship and each of the stroke looked like a dragon or a phoenix was dancing on the paper, while some others had very exquisite writing styles like that of famous calligraphers.</p>

  <p>It was very probable that these runes were written by the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay! Judging by this, Luo Luo Zheng assumed that Holy Jay had also obtained some Sanskrit words, which recorded the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>The information that was available to Luo Luo Zheng was too little for him to deduce any further.</p>

  <p>If that was really the case, then the Ice Soul Flame was probably not just a type of profound mystery of the Ice Law?</p>

  <p>While he was lost in thought, the band of light formed by the Sanskrit words suddenly began to move on the chaotic sea. It was like a living creature, floating towards the central continent in Luo Zheng's inner world!</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>As he saw these Sanskrit words begin to move, Luo Luo Zheng instantly became vigilant, waiting to jump into action at the slightest provocation.</p>

  <p>However, his inner world was not as fragile as that of the other martial artists. Chaotic energy itself was an extremely powerful existence.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, it was the highest level of original substance. If these Sanskrit words made any strange movements, Luo Luo Zheng would instantly use the chaotic energy to devour them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's worst fears came true, and he wasn't even able to control it. As the thousands of miles long Sanskrit words flowed, they circled a part of the sea at the other end of the central continent, and then the temperature began to drop!</p>

  <p>The moment the band of Sanskrit words released the cold air, Luo Luo Zheng immediately activated the special property of the chaotic energy in order to devour them!</p>

  <p>However, he quickly discovered that it was useless!</p>

  <p>These Sanskrit words couldn't be devoured. In fact, even the chaotic sea that was being circled by the Sanskrit words, was out of Luo Zheng's control. It was as if at this moment, he had lost the control of a portion of chaotic energy within his body.</p>

  <p>He had actually lost control of his own inner world. This was something that had never happened to him before! It was a scary situation to be in.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the chaotic energy in the sea, controlled by the Sanskrit words, was frozen and, at the same time, it started to turn into an extremely solid layer of ice. At first, the layer of ice was brown, after all, it was formed by the chaotic sea, but not long after, it turned into a bluish-white color, exactly the same as the cold flame field!</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom!"</p>

  <p>This ice field was not small by any standards; it was almost one-third of the size of the central continent!</p>

  <p>A huge ice field suddenly appeared at the side. As it expanded, the entire central continent began to shake. The living beings on the central continent naturally panicked in the face of such an intense earthquake!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the tremors disappeared quickly. When the ice field was completely formed, the earthquake ceased.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an icicle appeared abruptly in the center of the ice field and began to grow uncontrollably. As it continued growing, countless branches started forming on top of the icicle?</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the icicle turned into an enormous ice tree standing upright on the ice field!</p>

  <p>"A new continent is formed?" Luo Luo Zheng mumbled.</p>

  <p>This ice field formed a pressure in his inner world, pushing the chaotic sea outwards. Luo Luo Zheng felt a faint swelling sensation in his cinnabar field; this was caused by the expansion of his inner world. It was a sign that his cultivation level had increased!</p>

  <p>The ice tree continued to flourish inside. It was originally only about 1000 feet tall, but several minutes later, it had already grown to tens of thousands of feet tall. It was now almost the same height as the World Tree on the other side of the central continent!</p>

  <p>A magnificent cold flame flower bloomed atop the phenomenal ice tree.</p>

  <p>If one were to look down at this scene from the sky at this moment, one would see that on the west side of the central continent was a cyan World Tree that reached into the clouds, and on the other side was a crystal clear ice tree. They stood opposite each other, yet formed a harmonious scene...</p>

  <p>The meaning of this development was unclear to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Creating Axe slashed and created space for the divine land to come into existence, and later the Lord of Weapons opened the heavens...</p>

  <p>Sunrest Tree, Lofty Tree, Ray Tree, Hidden Tree? these were the four divine trees.</p>

  <p>Perhaps these four great trees were not extraordinary themselves.</p>

  <p>It was just that these four divine trees had all been planted during the first divine era. Their roots directly penetrated through the divine land and extended into the chaos, thus giving them the ability to absorb the chaos for their own uses. Having absorbed the chaos for countless years, they finally had the qualifications to become divine trees!</p>

  <p>The four divine trees had stabilized the divine land, however they shared a symbiotic relationship with the land as they also relied on it to stabilize their own positions in order to become the unshakable four pillars of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had used a World Tree seed to create his first giant tree. Now, another ice tree had appeared on the ice field. These two trees would also absorb the chaotic energy to grow, and they would also grow into divine trees in the future!</p>

  <p>As for the cold flame flower that had blossomed on top of the ice tree?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retracted his consciousness from his inner world, and then slightly spread out the five fingers in one of his hands.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle? "</p>

  <p>A cold flame was set ablaze in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>'It is just as I thought!'</p>

  <p>A hint of a smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he expertly poured chaotic energy into the cold flame!</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the size of this cold flame expanded by more than ten times and instantly enveloped Luo Luo Zheng. The frosty air emitted from this cold flame was so strong that even the mercury that formed the mirror beside him froze!</p>
