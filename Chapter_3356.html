<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jean's eyes glinted dangerously as she began to assess the weight of the situation.</p>

  <p>Even though her strength was comparable to Concubine Yan's, it was unwise to fight Concubine Yan openly within the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>In any case, she was cautious enough not to do anything foolish. Moreover, Concubine Yan said that Luo Zheng held a greater importance in the Taiyi Heaven Palace than they did.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was truly significant to the palace, she wouldn't want to further complicate things. Otherwise, her position in the Phoenix Palace would be at stake. Once Eastern Emperor Taiyi punished her, she would be demoted from her current position.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Concubine Yan merely stood there waiting calmly, with a charming smile etched on her face.</p>

  <p>In actuality, she had set this trap up. The only thing she had to do now was wait for Jean to take the bait and walk into it.</p>

  <p>The tension in the area was almost palpable. Even the direct descendants felt their hearts pounding against their ribs.</p>

  <p>It was not that big of a deal for the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace to fight in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>However, it would be a serious matter if the two wives of the emperor fought there. Moreover, both of them held high positions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others remained quiet while assessing the current scenario. He surmised that Concubine Yan was confident enough to challenge Jean on the spot.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard a melodious chime coming from the depths of the Phoenix Palace. It rang all throughout the entire palace.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan, Jean, and the direct descendants turned their heads toward the direction of the chime.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, they heard a loud booming voice. It was such a magnificent sound that resonated from the depths of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, come here and meet Eastern Emperor Taiyi."</p>

  <p>The entirety of the Phoenix Palace heard the voice clearly.</p>

  <p>"He is awake!" Concubine Yan wasn't able to hide her surprise.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been cultivating in solitude for such a long time.</p>

  <p>This worried the other people in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Jean also showed a flash of surprise on her face. Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally woke up. But instead of summoning someone from their palace, the first person he wanted to see was Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>"With all due respect, Lady Concubine Yan, who do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked courteously.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan responded with a smile and said, "It's Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Make haste. He already summoned you. I'll escort you there."</p>

  <p>"You'll be showing me the way?" Luo Zheng exchanged looks with Nelly, Xun and Liusu. One thing was for certain. They were all dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Jean was extremely narrow-minded. What would happen if she got mad at the girls after he left with Concubine Yan? After all, they wouldn't be able to resist clashing with a strong warrior like her.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Concubine Yan perfectly understood what worried Luo Zheng. She casually said, "There is no need to worry. This is the Phoenix Palace. Even though some of the people here might be unreasonable, they are not completely foolish. They won't tempt fate and bring about their own deaths."</p>

  <p>The first person Eastern Emperor Taiyi wanted to meet after he just woke up was Luo Zheng. Even a fool would be able to grasp the true importance of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter how senseless Jean was, she wouldn't kill Nelly and the other two. In addition to that, the Phoenix Palace was not exactly huge. Masters like Concubine Yan would be able to cover it easily with her spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>After hearing that, Luo Zheng turned to the three girls and said, "Kindly wait for me in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace."</p>

  <p>Nelly, Xun, and Liusu had already been living in the Phoenix Palace for a considerable period of time. In that time, they had heard so much about the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The legend of Eastern Emperor Taiyi had an even greater impact on them. They found it extremely fascinating.</p>

  <p>He was a great warrior who gathered and established an outstanding force of the humans using his own strength. Moreover, he was the supreme leader of the Taiyi Heaven Palace!</p>

  <p>The moment he finished his cultivation in seclusion, he wanted to meet Luo Zheng. For this, they felt incredibly honored and proud.</p>

  <p>"Understood!" Liusu and Nelly nodded their heads in response.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xun smiled at him and tilted her head to one side. It was a good thing that the girls accepted this order obediently.</p>

  <p>With that said, Concubine Yan turned around and led the way. Luo Zheng followed her politely.</p>

  <p>Ahmad and Chance remained rooted to the spot. They were completely stunned. Chance was even more shocked by the unexpected turn of events.</p>

  <p>He had rarely seen his father, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, over the last several years. Yet, his father wanted to meet Luo Zheng who was merely a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. What on earth was happening?</p>

  <p>"Mother, where exactly does this guy come from?" Chance asked Jean out of confusion.</p>

  <p>"How was I supposed to know?!" Jean retorted. "You harassed him without even knowing his background? You are always causing problems for me!"</p>

  <p>Jean was in no way inferior to Concubine Yan when it came to strength. However, she was always at a disadvantage because Concubine Yan had been favored by Eastern Emperor Taiyi the moment she got promoted. If Concubine Yan chose to tell him of this incident, her current position would be in jeopardy.</p>

  <p>Sensing their mother's anger, both Chance and Ahmad were now trembling with fear.</p>

  <p>Chance felt wronged. She also wanted to kill Luo Zheng even before knowing his background. He wasn't the only one at fault.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't dare say these thoughts out loud. He had no intention of contradicting his mother.</p>

  <p>With a cold expression on her face, Jean just huffed and stormed off.</p>

  <p>True to what Concubine Yan said, it was obvious she wouldn't do anything stupid.</p>

  <p>She wouldn't hurt those three girls.</p>

  <p>On their way towards the emperor, Luo Zheng finally saw a chance to ask about something that he was always curious about. He turned to Concubine Yan and inquired, "Lady Concubine Yan, is there no empress in the Phoenix Palace?"</p>

  <p>In his own perception, people were often fond of becoming emperors in the mortal world.</p>

  <p>Such eye-catching titles could easily gather and reinforce their imperial power.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, people in the world of warriors cultivated themselves by defying the laws of nature. They honored strength above all else. Even with a good title, one would be kicked out of the throne sooner or later if they were not strong enough.</p>

  <p>One's lifespan would last long after they reached the True God Realm. After that, they normally would not care about titles anymore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, except the four divine kingdoms in the Lower World, the great forces Luo Zheng had ever met rarely established divine kingdoms. Moreover, in the divine land, those forces would only claim themselves as powerful clans.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the Source World had retaken the hierarchy of the secular world once more.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Concubine Yan smiled. "We are different from the Nine Li race, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race. They all take blood relationship as their basis, so each of them is more closely united than us. Eastern Emperor Taiyi established the Taiyi Heaven Palace in the Bloom Divine Province because he wanted to gather all the humans that were dispersed all throughout the Source World. He did it to form another human force. As a result, we need to make use of the hierarchy of a kingdom," she graciously explained.</p>

  <p>The seven emperors of the seven mountains settled in the Bloom Divine Province. They formed an orthodox force and welcomed all humans from all over the world.</p>

  <p>In the old days, it had been difficult for Eastern Emperor Taiyi to establish a strong force of humans. Instead of wasting his energy in creating a new system, he chose to use the traditional titles and routines. Thus, this hierarchy was formed.</p>

  <p>"There is definitely no empress in this palace," Concubine Yan finally confirmed while grinning.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, some of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's wives, specifically Jean, had tried many times to compete for the empress throne. However, she was rejected by Eastern Emperor Taiyi every time.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan continued to explain this to Luo Zheng while they walked into the depths of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>As soon as they stopped walking, an exquisite three-story pavilion came into sight. Compared to the magnificent halls he saw while walking inside the Phoenix Palace, this seemed a bit simpler.</p>

  <p>"You can go inside now, Luo Zheng." Concubine Yan stopped walking as soon as they reached the pavilion. Her escort duty to Luo Zheng had been fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"I'm going in alone?" Luo Zheng was taken aback. He thought Concubine Yan would accompany him inside as well.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan nodded in response. "He only summoned you. Hence, you have to enter by yourself."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the simple door of the pavilion. Promptly, he stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The pavilion was indeed small but the interior design was very elegant. As soon as he stepped inside it, a faint fragrance greeted his nose. He couldn't quite place what the fragrance was. Nevertheless, it somehow made him feel peaceful.</p>

  <p>A thin veil covered the main hall of the pavilion. It was such a delicate fabric yet it concealed whatever it had behind it.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked closer to it, the veil curtains automatically opened and moved toward the sides.</p>

  <p>He saw a simple yet ancient-looking screen bearing an illustration of an exquisitely huge bell standing in the middle of the main hall. This bell looked exactly the same as the Bell of Eastern Emperor that Chance had activated with his blood.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man clothed in a grey robe came out from the side of the screen.</p>

  <p>This man wore a purple and gold crown upon his head. He had a square face, his eyes looked as sharp as hawk's, and his facial expression was serious. It commanded a magnificent presence. He was the great Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng cupped his hands together and bowed to him.</p>
