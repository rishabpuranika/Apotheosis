<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 747 Break The Purple Power Domain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At Zheng's question, the two dragons claimed they were unsure.</p>

  <p>"Her space node is definitely somewhere in the fighting arena. It is hidden, but as long as you use the Space Law to shuttle back and forth, you should be able to discover it," the cyan dragon added.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it must be." Zheng's body flickered as he took a step forward.</p>

  <p>He once again dodged the twenty-one giant swords above his head as he shuttled through space.</p>

  <p>As the twenty-one giant swords plunged into the ground, half of the entire arena was crushed. The arena that was built with the efforts of countless craftsmen now looked like a tilted and sunken boat. One end was raised high, while the other was pressed into the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved through the giant swords, from above to below and from side to side, while the life vitality within his body whirled unceasingly, supporting him in activating the Space Law.</p>

  <p>More giant swords kept crashing and gradually disappearing. Zheng's figure too kept swaying. Each time he moved through space, countless afterimages were left behind� these were the shadows and illusions projected in space.</p>

  <p>The scene confused the warriors in the audience.</p>

  <p>"What is Luo Zheng doing?"</p>

  <p>"It is true that he's able to effectively avoid the giant swords by constantly shuffling through space. However, as more and more giant swords appear, he would be unable to escape death in the end."</p>

  <p>"He's just spinning things out. What a pity! This championship of the Martial Arts Contest might as well be won by Marilyn. I'm afraid the Dragon Soar Arena will fall into her hands."</p>

  <p>Although these warriors did not have the qualifications required to participate in the Martial Arts Contest, they had a good understanding of the current situation. In their opinion, the ones with the most strength to compete for the top three positions were only Brent, Marilyn, and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was no way that Marilyn would spare Luo Zheng in the battle. He was destined to die. Then, the final round would take place between Marilyn and Brent. As for Brent� It seemed as though he would be unable to snap the Purple Power Domain.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power Domain was mighty. It couldn't be harmed at all. It was simply an unbreakable domain, in which no one could defeat Marilyn.</p>

  <p>A transparent crystal floated over Yudie's hand. Inside it was an eye with the size of a walnut. It was unknown what creature's eye it was, but it looked as if it had a life of its own as it rotated and looked about.</p>

  <p>Yudie's small hand gripped the lower half of the crystal as she watched Zheng's every move.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall had a long history, and as the second largest sect of the Central Region, its legacy was rich.</p>

  <p>The crystal in her hand contained the magical eye of a young Angel of Death, a beast with three magical eyes. The thirteenth leader of the Cloud Hall had obtained the magical eye from the Arctic Icecap four thousand years ago, and then sealed it in the crystal with a secret technique.</p>

  <p>The Angel of Death was not counted among the great legendary beasts, but it was still a mortal enemy of the Genuine Dragon. The magical eye in the crystal was the young Angel of Death's third eye. It could be used three times after being refined with a secret method.</p>

  <p>The magical eye had now been used twice in the history of the Cloud Hall when it was faced with great danger. The magical eye's power was enough to kill any warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>But it was not sufficient to kill Eddie. After all, Eddie was above the Virtual Tribulation Realm. However, the magical eye� capable of destroying any and everything� would be able to seek out and kill Marilyn, who was currently out of sight and hidden.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was aware of the consequences of using the magical eye. It was possible that she would drag the Cloud Hall into an irreparable calamity, so she still hesitated, waiting for the situation to pan out differently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, more and more giant swords materialized in the arena. The number had now gone up to forty.</p>

  <p>The forty swords crashed down at the same time, nearly swallowing up the arena. Luo Zheng dodged the swords neatly to find a narrow gap and avoid the fall.</p>

  <p>A few swords fell close to Zheng's chest and back, creating giant craters in the arena.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Before the next wave of swords could land, Zheng's figure shuttled through space again. This time, as he made his way, he suddenly noticed a strange movement in space, as if the space itself had become somewhat distorted in the moment.</p>

  <p>Space in this world was extremely stable, thus Luo Zheng was unable to discover any black lines here, like the ones he had found in the space of the Cloud Road. In an instant, he realized that this was the space node, the place where Marilyn was hiding.</p>

  <p>Just as this thought arose in his mind, another forty swords popped up and slashed downwards.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure swayed back and forth once again. He circled around the edge of the arena to avoid the giant swords. Then, he took a long sword out of his space ring and stabbed it in the direction of the space node. Undoubtedly, it was the sharpest lunge of a sword he had ever made.</p>

  <p>"What does Luo Zheng want to do? Why does he seem to be attacking the void?"</p>

  <p>"Did he discover something? Could it be where Marilyn is hiding?"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me he has been driven mad by the giant swords. There's clearly nothing there..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's long sword pierced through the space node. A strange flower, dripping of blood, bloomed in the air and a figure staggered out from inside of it. She held her chest in alarm and stared at Luo Zheng with a pair of vicious eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is actually someone there! Marilyn was hiding in the void!" a warrior shouted out loud.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gripped his sacred weapon tightly and stared at Marilyn. "Who said I couldn't break your Purple Power Domain?"</p>

  <p>Marilyn clutched her bleeding chest. A hint of blood became apparent on her pale and gloomy face. She cackled, the sound filled with malice. "I didn't expect you to find me in such a clumsy manner."</p>

  <p>She didn't feel so good being stabbed with a sacred weapon. It was fortunate that Zheng's sword didn't have any special powers infused to it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because it was a sword, it didn't contain any martial skills.</p>

  <p>However, its toughness and power were still comparable to other sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>"I have no interest in playing hide and seek with you. Since I've found you, you must die!" Luo Zheng did not stay put any longer. His figure flashed again as he leaped through space and lunged at her with his sword.</p>

  <p>A smile still lingered on Marilyn's face, like she was wholly confident of herself. "I didn't expect that. I must admit that I underestimated you.</p>

  <p>However, you were wrong to think that I would let you outsmart me in this way!" Dodging Zheng's sword, she left her wound uncovered, allowing the blood dripping from it to splatter to the ground. She smiled more widely.</p>

  <p>"This skill is a bit unstable. Even I can't control it so well..."</p>

  <p>The drops of blood dripping to the ground did not seep into it. Instead, they bounced around incessantly like little bugs.</p>

  <p>The droplets of blood lined up together, morphing into a unique rune. The life vitality inside of Marilyn's body began flowing to it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, another beam of purple light shot into the space node that Luo Zheng had just stabbed at.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's vigilant voice resounded in Zheng's mind all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, quick! Kill this woman! She is summoning the true spirit of the Purple Power World. Even if the weakest true spirit were to come, it would finish you off!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had been indifferent when Luo Zheng was being crushed by the giant swords summoned by Marilyn in the arena. He had truly believed that the swords would cause no fatal damage to Luo Zheng, and he had been proven correct.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, the cyan dragon was rather anxious.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the cyan dragon said, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate. He took a single step to stop in front of Marilyn and then chopped at her.</p>

  <p>Once again, Marilyn's figure danced in the air. She was able to dodge the attack once again. However, half of her long hair was cut off.</p>

  <p>"Again!" The killing intent in Zheng's eyes surged forward as he rushed toward Marilyn once again. He simply couldn't allow her a chance to catch her breath.</p>

  <p>Marilyn instinctively understood that they had reached a most crucial moment. Her figure flickered once again.</p>

  <p>However, it was tough for her to dodge a sword strike that was combined with the Space Law and danced to its tune. This particular attack managed to pierce through Marilyn's ribs.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Successfully having stabbed her, Luo Zheng put his sword back into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Now, he rushed closer to Marilyn to throw a punch at her.</p>

  <p>He had never been so ruthless to a woman before, but he knew he had no other choice but to kill her.</p>

  <p>As Marilyn saw Zheng's fist coming at her, she realized that his strength was not that of any ordinary warrior. His fist might be even deadlier than his sword.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment, she waved her hand in a sleek motion and a purple enchanted barrier enveloped her.</p>

  <p>"Enchanted barrier? Useless!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exerted the power of the Emerald Crystal in his left arm and injected it into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier broke into pieces like an eggshell.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng threw another punch at her chest, knocking her down to the ground from the air above. The power in the single punch was enough to crack the bones in her body, making her collapse limply as if she had no bones at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was relieved when he saw the light on the blood rune fade away and vanish. He wasn't sure what a true spirit was, but he was certain that he was no match for it. If this woman had summoned the true spirit, he would have been dead for sure.</p>
