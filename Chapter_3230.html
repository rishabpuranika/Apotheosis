<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Dorothy followed the crowd, heading for the back of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's temple.</p>

  <p>A square platform was situated at the intersection of three temples. This was known as the Soul Arena.</p>

  <p>The surface of the arena was covered all over with a layer of pale blue powder, which was made of the same material as the Soul Binding Thread.</p>

  <p>The powder was used to enforce an important rule. A fighter in the Soul Arena was not allowed to leave the Other Shore. Otherwise, when one was losing, they could simply leave the battle. The powder ensured that warriors who participated in the fight could not just escape.</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many people here?" Luo Zheng asked, glancing at the crowd of warriors around the arena.</p>

  <p>A large number of people were gathered around the Soul Arena, and all of them were strong Souls of Light. Many shone with vivid purple light, indicating that they were Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>"The situation is getting more and more strange," Dorothy said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Most people came to the Other Shore primarily to search for suitable Other Shore Tokens. Many were not even interested in the soul battles.</p>

  <p>Although the Soul Arena had been established here for a long time, it simply wasn't very popular among warriors.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the arena was surrounded with warriors. The people of the Bearing race were present, and the members of the Divine Farmer race were also in the crowd.</p>

  <p>When there were still four great human forces, it was the time when humans had forged the strongest unity.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race couldn't have wiped out the Nine Li race on their own.</p>

  <p>They succeeded because they allied with the Divine Farmer race to deal with the people of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The cooperation between the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had long been a source of some concern to the Taiyi Heaven Palace. But because the Bearing race and the Taiyi Heaven Palace were quite distant from each other geographically, the palace was placated, and generally existed in harmony with both the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>Yet Qiu Yinhe's prediction held true. The Taiyi Heaven Palace would eventually clash with the Bearing race, and the two races would turn against each other.</p>

  <p>Seamus Ji, the man who had previously driven the surge of snakes, stepped onto the Soul Arena. The crowd quieted as they focused their attention on him. He waited until everyone was listening, and then said in a loud voice,</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, ten men of the Bearing race were defeated one after another.</p>

  <p>My younger brother was one of those men. He sustained soul damage in the fight, and he still hasn't awakened. On behalf of my brother, I challenge the warrior who defeated him? Milo Mo!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Seamus Ji stopped talking, a clamor rose up from the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Their Souls of Light emitted powerful auras, displaying quite intimidating strength.</p>

  <p>Milo stepped up onto the Soul Arena. He showed no sign of fear.</p>

  <p>Nonchalantly, he said, "No need to talk so much. If you want a fight, then let's fight!"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Seamus Ji coldly. "It is tradition to place bets on the outcome of battles in the Soul Arena. Today is no exception."</p>

  <p>"You want to bet?" Milo said impatiently. "Fine! How about I bet a thousand soul pills on my victory?"</p>

  <p>To an ordinary disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, a thousand soul pills were a lot. But to Milo and Seamus Ji, it was an insignificant amount. The perfunctory offer made it clear that Milo had no interest in betting.</p>

  <p>Seamus Ji understood this, and he scowled fiercely. "A thousand soul pills is not enough!" He turned and gestured to a man behind him.</p>

  <p>At his command, the man stepped forward, taking out a large, transparent ball from his Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>The sight of the huge, shining ball elicited cries of astonishment from the people around the Soul Arena.</p>

  <p>"The soul crystal!"</p>

  <p>"That's a large chunk of soul crystal!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God..."</p>

  <p>"Is Seamus really going to bet the soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Dorothy, who had been watching the exchange between Seamus Ji and Milo, were stunned.</p>

  <p>Soul crystal was an extremely precious object. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to buy it even with large amounts of divine crystals or soul pills. Soul crystal was priceless.</p>

  <p>The soul crystal in the transparent, shining ball was enough to transform a warrior's soul into an Indigo Soul. Any warrior would fight hard to obtain the soul crystal, which was even larger than the one Luo Zheng had absorbed in the temple just now.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth it? Why would he risk such a large chunk of soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also deep in thought. He couldn't fathom where the soul crystal had come from. Regardless of Seamus Ji's rank in the Bearing race, he shouldn't have such a large chunk of soul crystal. And if he did, he shouldn't be able to risk losing it all on a rash bet. What was his intention here?</p>

  <p>Milo had been utterly disinterested in betting, but at the sight of the soul crystal, his face lit up with excitement. He had yet to become an Indigo Soul yet. Winning this bet would dramatically accelerate that process. Yet his next words were unexpected. His face turned serious again as he said to Seamus Ji, "It seems this battle cannot continue."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Seamus Ji demanded, his own expression darkening.</p>

  <p>Milo laughed bitterly. "Your bet is too precious. I can't match it. I don't have such a large chunk of soul crystal."</p>

  <p>He wondered if Seamus Ji would insist on pushing through with the battle, since the difference in value between a thousand soul pills and that huge chunk of soul crystal was so vast.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Seamus Ji waved his hand and said curtly, "It doesn't matter.</p>

  <p>Let me finish what I have to say. Although I am betting this chunk of soul crystal, it's not easy to get it."</p>

  <p>He turned once more to his people and made another gesture, at which two members of the Bearing race stepped forward.</p>

  <p>These two Souls of Light emitted cold, powerful auras. They were obviously very strong even among the Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>"Three of us will challenge the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Two people will fight at a time, one from the Bearing race and one from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Any time someone is defeated, another must take his place. If all three of us lose, the soul crystal will be given to the last Taiyi Heaven Palace disciple standing," said Seamus Ji.</p>

  <p>His proposal caught the interest of many of the disciples around the arena.</p>

  <p>If someone fought against the three warriors alone, it would be quite difficult.</p>

  <p>But Seamus Ji was offering to let them take turns fighting against their three warriors until all of them were defeated.</p>

  <p>Many thought to themselves, 'If I am the one who defeats the last of the three, then I will win the soul crystal!'</p>

  <p>But Milo quickly dashed everyone's plan. "You don't need to say anything more," he told Seamus Ji. "No one else will get the chance to fight. I can beat all three of you alone."</p>

  <p>Seamus Ji sneered at him, and then walked out of the Soul Arena. He motioned for one of his men to step up. "Deon, you will be the first to fight Milo!"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Deon Ji leaped into the Soul Arena.</p>

  <p>There was a hiss of sound, and six purple Soul Rings appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>His cold, powerful Indigo Soul sent out a strong aura across the Soul Arena, and weaker Souls of Light trembled at its force.</p>

  <p>Milo smiled faintly. His own Soul of Light emanated in the arena wisps of white light that swept out and formed a small whirlpool which emitted a bold, sharp intent.</p>

  <p>"What a strong truth aura!" Dorothy exclaimed, gazing at the shining white whirlpool of light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "Can't you figure out the origin of the white light?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy thought for a moment and then responded, "That's the Truth Enlightenment! How could he combine it with his soul token so soon?"</p>

  <p>She had practiced the first one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment, and thus was able to recognize the origin of the white vortex.</p>

  <p>"It is," Luo Zheng nodded. "I'm not sure yet either."</p>

  <p>Maybe Milo had mastered it in such a short period of time because the first hundred-odd words of the Truth Enlightenment were a perfect match of the Flow Strike.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the Origin Swordsmanship practiced by Dorothy was not a soul token, and she hadn't gone deep into this aspect. It was not easy to combine the two? perhaps it would have to be done by her grandmother.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the white light released by Milo had vanished, and in its place, an invisible sharp sword appeared, rushing rapidly towards Deon Ji.</p>
