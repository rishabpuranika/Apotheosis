<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others, were all thrown into a state of confusion.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to defeat the downgrader was in the Ruin Graveyard?</p>

  <p>Although the Ruin Graveyard was created by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's painstaking efforts, after the chaos began to downgrade, it was unable to even survive itself. Did it have what it took to defeat the downgrader once and for all?</p>

  <p>What were the odds of it coming true?</p>

  <p>Just as they remained in their spots and made efforts to sort their thoughts out, a bright light suddenly erupted before their eyes from the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The bright light ascended upwards and pierced through the sky.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Damn, what incredible energy!"</p>

  <p>"Who could possibly possess such astounding theurgy in the Ruin Graveyard?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods kept their gazes fixated at the source of the energy as their eyes glowed from the reflection of the blinding light.</p>

  <p>Although the Pear Hill was adjacent to the Ruin Graveyard, there was still a significant amount of distance that separated the two huge lands from each other. Even so, the energy fluctuating from the light was so overpowering that it could be felt through distances far and wide!</p>

  <p>The power that this beam of light harnessed far surpassed that of the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>If the beam of light wasn't contained in time, it could pierce through the sky shrouded in crimson red and reach the ends of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, just as this unstoppable beam of light extended towards the bloody red sky, many obstructions containing energy in the form of green beehives appeared to stop it in its tracks. Although the beam of light was considerably stronger than the beehives, the moment they collided with each other, a clear deafening sound reverberated through the sky and sent vibrations far and wide. The two seemed to have canceled each other out and later withered away till they vanished out of sight.</p>

  <p>"Is this your doing? Is this the opportunity you were talking about?" the Snake Goddess asked while still gazing at the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng, too, wore a puzzled expression on his face as he looked into the distance. Fortunately, he had omniscient abilities in the primitive land. As he focused for a brief moment, he learned what had happened, and a smile of relief appeared on his face as his tense expression eased up. "It wasn't us who did it, but there's no doubt in my mind that the opportunity is there. Everyone! Follow me!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Zheng wrapped everyone in a layer of space created by him. The next moment, they had teleported inside the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>On a cliff in the Ruin Graveyard, Tianming stood rooted to his spot with the Lone Sword in his grip, his eyes wide open in shock.</p>

  <p>Ever since Geoffrey pulled out the black stone on the holy pillar that was connected to the sword at the other end, the Lone Sword had lost its old essence as it stopped being responsive and turned into a lifeless scrap of metal. However, Tianming didn't seem to worry about it too much. Geoffrey had told him that he would continue to seek out a stronger power that could strengthen the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>But today, Tianming felt something strange happen to the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>Unusual, intricate patterns painted in a silver yellow color suddenly began to appear on the surface of the sword. These patterns began to carve themselves into the sword from the bottom and slowly made their way to the top, almost covering the entire sword, giving it a new appearance. Just as he was consumed with confusion concerning the strange behavior of the sword, he felt a vivid surge of energy gushing out from the sword.</p>

  <p>This power was on a whole other level from what it previously withheld.</p>

  <p>Before, the overall power of the sword was dangerously violent, which made it hard for Tianming to contain it with his current strength. It was not compatible with his temperament.</p>

  <p>However, right now, the energy flowing within the Lone Sword was as endless as a vast ocean. Slowly, it filled his chest like flowing water.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but give the sword a wave in a panicked state. The sheer intensity of the strike left him speechless and shocked.</p>

  <p>This boundless raw power... was something he never expected to wield in his hands.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey really pulled it off!</p>

  <p>As a million thoughts raced through his mind to process his current situation, Zheng and his group suddenly appeared before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Zheng, listen to me! Geoffrey really did it! This sword... this Lone Sword has surpassed its previous capabilities and has gotten so powerful!"</p>

  <p>Tianming was so excited that his voice cracked in between his words as he desperately tried to tell Zheng in one breath.</p>

  <p>Zheng returned his smile and gave an acknowledging nod. "I know. You have succeeded!"</p>

  <p>If the downgrader had never existed, Zheng would have been as ecstatic as Tianming felt with his newly acquired power. After all, Tianming would become Zheng's strongest aid, standing by his side to support him in the face of any crisis.</p>

  <p>However, their current enemy was the downgrader, an existence impossible to defeat by simply relying on the power of the main world.</p>

  <p>"Why does such a formidable force exist? It's impossible to make it even with the aid of an Other Shore Token from the Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. How did Geoffrey manage to make it?" Kendrick asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>In response to his question, Kincaid replied in a rather calm tone, "This sword is linked to the Sunlight Annihilation Light. It was once my most powerful Holy Item."</p>

  <p>"So it's a Holy Item..." Tianming muttered in a tone only audible to himself as he stared deeply at the sword in his hands. He quickly switched his gaze from the sword to Kincaid and asked, "Wait... you said that this was once your Holy Item. That must mean that you are..."</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is the Human Spirit King, Kincaid," Zheng interrupted Tianming as he introduced him to Kincaid. "Geoffrey must have climbed onto the holy pillar of the Human Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>With the sudden revelation that now lay bare to him, Tianming remained stunned in place with his mouth wide open. Suddenly, he nodded to himself and took two steps in the direction of Kincaid before holding his sword horizontally towards him. "If that's the case, then I shall return the sword back to its original owner."</p>

  <p>Tianming had a dignified personality, he wasn't one to hog someone else's treasure and keep it to himself, so he naturally felt like he had to return it.</p>

  <p>However, Kincaid put one hand forward, signaling him to stop as he gave him a faint smile and shook his head. "It's true that it once belonged to me. However, now, the time has changed, and it has brought about a great change to the world. I no longer own this Holy Item. It's rightfully yours now."</p>

  <p>The moment Tianming opened his mouth to say something in response, he was interrupted when he felt a slight movement from the Lone Sword. It was Geoffrey tugging on the link connected to the Holy Item from the other end. "Geoffrey seems to have something to say!"</p>

  <p>"What is it? What's he saying?" Zheng asked hurriedly, sounding desperate to know.</p>

  <p>The Lone Sword was no longer the center of attention. Everyone's concentration shifted towards communicating with Geoffrey through the sword.</p>

  <p>Everyone remained quiet as Tianming closed his eyes and grasped the Lone Sword tightly in his grip to perceive what Geoffrey was trying to say.</p>

  <p>After a while, he wore a dumbfounded expression on his face as he addressed everyone present there, "He said, Uncle Tianming, the sword has become really powerful, hasn't it? Are you satisfied with the improvement?"</p>

  <p>The kid was showing off his capabilities with the utmost confidence on the top of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>"It's amazing! It's so formidable that it's easily the strongest Other Shore Token I have ever seen!" Tianming replied to Geoffrey's question wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>To insert the black stone into the top of the pillar, Geoffrey had put in a lot of effort. At this moment, he was extremely proud of himself after having heard the positive results. When he found out that his father and some others were also beside Tianming listening in from the other end, he fiddled with the link and continued to boast, "If you are not satisfied with it, I can connect it with another one for you. I still have several options here!"</p>

  <p>"There's no need for that. Your father wants to speak to you," Tianming said as he handed the Lone Sword to Zheng and stood aside. He could see that Zheng and the others were desperate to communicate with Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>This kind of exchange was strenuous on people on the both ends, so Zheng didn't want to waste any time and cut straight to the chase. "Geoffrey, it's true that I'm proud of what you've done. Controlling this sword is enough to make your Uncle Tianming the number one warrior in the chaos, but the enemy we are facing is far stronger. We need your help to defeat it."</p>

  <p>"Stronger, you say? How strong could it even be?" Geoffrey replied nonchalantly, seemingly unfazed by Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever witnessed the Deep Space?" Zheng asked, maintaining his calm demeanor.</p>

  <p>"You mean the remains floating in the sky? Yeah, I've seen it before. I can see it from a certain position of the holy pillar," Geoffrey replied.</p>

  <p>He could see it when he climbed to the top of the holy pillars of the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect. It was easily visible from there.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to explain to Geoffrey the dire situation they were in, "The enemy we are about to face is from that place, so we need you to find a person in the Deep Space, whose surname is Xue."</p>

  <p>There was another key point to consider in the plan that Kincaid had proposed - Geoffrey could walk freely within the main world, but could he walk freely in the Deep Space?</p>

  <p>Whether it was Elder Xue, Kincaid, or Sheehan, if they entered the Deep Space, they would find themselves in the exact same situation as Zheng when he had entered the main world, as they were rendered sightless and couldn't see anything and it would be very difficult for them to even walk.</p>

  <p>This was all because they did not belong to the fifth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Geoffrey, the Deep Space was in a broken state. A large part of the space had already been downgraded and reduced to the main world, and that was why the Four Spirits Sect had the chance to explore the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of the task was the last thing on Geoffrey's mind. Instead, he was eager to prove his usefulness to his father. "The Deep Space is on a significant height. Is there a way I can get there?"</p>
