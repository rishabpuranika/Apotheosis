</p>

  <p>Xun was Luo Zheng's sword spirit. And needless to say, her strength would consequently grow along as Luo Luo Zheng gained strength. Most of the martial artists that had just entered the Life and Death Realm wouldn't be a match for her if she would fight alone. However, fighting solitarily against Eddie would be too difficult for her.</p>

  <p>But of course, the outcome was the one Luo Luo Zheng had expected it to be. Xun wouldn't be able to beat Eddie. And even if she could, he would not let her do it!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's goal in life was to reach the peak of martial arts. At the age of twenty, he already had a perfect start. He had conquered and stepped into the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. However, Eddie had already become his nemesis.</p>

  <p>If he ought to advance further on the path of martial arts, he had to kill Eddie himself. Otherwise, Eddie would become his mental burden, haunting him in the future. Thus he would not be able to get far on the path of martial arts. More likely, it would be a hindrance for him in reaching the peak of martial arts!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found himself in deep concentration. He was contemplating that back when he had returned from the Sea God Continent, if he had invited Miguel, or even a powerful master like Amber to personally make a trip to the Central Region and help him, things would have been simple and he would have already gotten rid of Eddie!</p>

  <p>He was fully aware that as long as he asked, whether it was Miguel or Amber, they wouldn't refuse him!</p>

  <p>With their cultivation level in Soul Sea Realm, they could easily defeat anyone in the Central Region. To boot, Amber was a rare talent. She was an outstanding master amongst the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. Even a Life and Death Realm warrior like Eddie would pale in comparison. He wouldn't be able to resist the attacks from these masters.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, Luo Luo Zheng chose to fight against Eddie himself.</p>

  <p>Nothing would be more important to him than to clear this barrier with his own hands.</p>

  <p>And now, the time indeed was the most crucial.</p>

  <p>At the precise moment when Xun was able to hamper Eddie, Luo Luo Zheng abruptly took Ning Yudie. Then they both whirled around Oracle City before they attempted to rush headlong towards the city wall once again.</p>

  <p>At this time, the battle between the two sides was already in full swing!</p>

  <p>The army of the Heavenly Evil Sect was quite powerful. But the alliance between the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall was also a force to be reckoned with, especially the World Commercial Alliance which was widely known as a sixth-grade sect. Its strength was not something the Cloud Hall could measure up to!</p>

  <p>On the battlefield, hundreds of giant puppets came into sight. Their bodies which were as big as mountains constituted mainly of steel and iron. Under the command of the puppet technique, they simultaneously charged towards the army of the Heavenly Evil Sect. Thousands of lives would be gone in an instant every time a solitary puppet rushed forward to attack.</p>

  <p>Two coffins on the side of the Heavenly Evil Sect opened concurrently as two giant zombies emerged. Like a wind, these two moved in such precision as they rounded the area, killing two to three Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivators successively within a span of several minutes!</p>

  <p>In addition to these two zombies, a massive lampstand was also set ablaze on one part of the battleground. Amidst the wild display of flaring flames, a phoenix materialized!</p>

  <p>However, this phoenix was not a real super legendary beast. It was about just the same as Yudie's ice phoenix. They were only both spiritual projections. But the fire phoenix's power was strongly significant and must not be underestimated as it was notably a far cry from that of the strength possessed by an ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors. On its first appearance, the fire phoenix bellowed a loud piercing cry and flew towards Oracle City. And those general warriors hearing the terrifying sound could only flee in all directions!</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance, on the other hand, were all sad about the Ancient Tycoon's death. But they chose not to be affected by this as they did not have much time to be sorrowful in the face of the life and death battle of the World Commercial Alliance. At this moment, the three leaders were intensely fighting another Life and Death Realm warrior of the Heavenly Evil Sect, Simon!</p>

  <p>All in all, the overall situation worked to the disadvantage of the Oracle City. But still, the most crucial battle was between Eddie and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many people's eyes were apparently fixed on Luo Luo Zheng as soon as he returned to the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, among all the warriors present, whether it was the warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect or the warriors from the alliance, none of them interfered with the fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Eddie.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Xun transformed straightway into light spots as she wrapped around the long spear and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng to return to his body. She was defeated by Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Where is Eddie?" Luo Luo Zheng asked Xun.</p>

  <p>After they rushed out of Oracle City, Luo Luo Zheng did not see Eddie follow them out. So he vigilantly probed about Eddie's location.</p>

  <p>"The moment Eddie defeated me, he went into the ground. Be careful,"</p>

  <p>Xun warned him cautiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded as the two rays of starlight on his body slowly flowed separately and jumped into the air!</p>

  <p>Alas! Luo Luo Zheng still could not harm Eddie! He had already tried his best and even used all his power.</p>

  <p>It was too ironic! How come that the ogres whose bodies were far stronger than that of the human race could not be able to withstand the force in Luo Zheng's hit, but this Eddie was left unharmed even after taking so many punches from him. This fiend's body was too powerful.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let himself focused. To fight against Eddie, he could only use that one move, and he could only strike it for once!</p>

  <p>When the starlight split apart, it rushed fluidly towards Luo Zheng's hands. A beam of orange light became visible on one of Luo Zheng's hands, and a beam of purple light appeared on the other. Soon after, a faint light encased his eyes, making his presence more dignified!</p>

  <p>On top of the general guide recorded on the Stellar Body, there were also eight moves.</p>

  <p>The first move was the so-called Star Shakes The Earth, which was the easiest to grasp among them. All the cultivator just needed to do was to gather starlight, and then condense it into a fist. then finally aim it to hit the target. With a minimal boost of the power of stars, it could burst out a terrifying force. Luo Luo Zheng had utilized this first move against the original owner of the Tower of Sin during the test held at this tower. The owner failed to withstand its power, consequently leading to his defeat.</p>

  <p>However, at any rate, the first move of the Stellar Body was useless against Eddie!</p>

  <p>As stated on the records of the Stellar Body, practicing the second move would only be possible and commence if and only when the cultivator had already connected with the second star!</p>

  <p>Luckily for Luo Luo Zheng, he had just managed to be connected with the second star a while ago. He had been cultivating in seclusion during this time and was able to comprehend the second move. However, he was not proficient in it yet.</p>

  <p>He understood that the power of the second move was substantially stronger than that of the first move. And now, he was left with no other choice but to have a try at the second move.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gritted his teeth as his body sweated profusely. He stared hard at the ground, wondering which direction Eddie would come out.</p>

  <p>At that particular instant, however, when Luo Luo Zheng was scouting for Eddie's trace, two bright yellow winds suddenly blew from not too far away. It was the Life and Death Wind that Eddie released with the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>Eddie laughed sinisterly. "Now, both of you can go die!"</p>

  <p>"Dodge!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned for a brief moment when he saw the bright yellow winds, but with his quick reflex, he immediately dragged Ning Yudie and sank down!</p>

  <p>To everyone's astonishment, when the Life and Death Wind surfaced, it was as if it had a soul of its own. The winds just floated smoothly towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Wind was indeed exceptionally unusual. Any living creatures would have feared it instinctively. Therefore, every time this Life and Death Wind came into sight, everyone's heart would almost stop beating, and they would all stare blankly at the two bright yellow winds, as if they were anticipating for their last breath.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens' face sank, while the expressions of many martial artists in Cloud Hall also became heavy.</p>

  <p>When the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance caught sight of this, their faces eventually became gloomy. They all thought that even their master was unable to withstand this strange wind and instantly lost his life, then how could Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie possibly survive?</p>

  <p>Simon wore a sneer on his face. 'Luo Luo Zheng is destined to die this time, ' he thought happily.</p>

  <p>At that stretch of time, the light in Luo Zheng's hands began to flicker in a dazzling shine. He brought his hands together, and the two beams of differently colored starlight suddenly merged into one. In that fleeting moment, the entire world underwent a tremendous change!</p>

  <p>The sky became dark as if night had fallen all of a sudden. Everyone could only see two bright stars in the dark sky: one was orange, the other was purple. The two stars emitted unusual light, adding radiance and beauty to each other. And these light rays also shone brightly on Luo Zheng's hands!</p>

  <p>"Double Star Brilliance!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng calmly stated as he opened up his hands, his face as calm as water.</p>
