</p>

  <p>The runic brush pens greatly differed from one another. A well-chosen one could be of great help to a runic expert.</p>

  <p>The one Luo Luo Zheng had bought from Lasseter's shop was made of hematite.</p>

  <p>Beginners often chose this kind of pens to use. Although it was easily controlled by the soul, Luo Luo Zheng thought it was too heavy to wield freely. The runic brush pen was used to draw simple runes. If the user made a mistake, the rune would be ruined.</p>

  <p>However, some huge arrays consisted of hundreds or even thousands of runes. For instance, the sect protecting array Tia gave Felix was estimated to have more than thirteen thousand runes! Even the smallest mistakes weren't tolerated in the making of such large scale arrays.</p>

  <p>Although some individual runes might be replaced in case of mistakes happening, it was crucial that the most important one in the center of the sect protecting array, which contained thousands of lines, be made with no mistakes at all. If there was even a single, tiny error, the whole array would fail to perform its function.</p>

  <p>Thus, a good runic pen was important for a runic expert to make a huge rune.</p>

  <p>Felix's pen was made from the tip of a fiery cloud bamboo. The bamboo tip could remain soft and alive up to a hundred years. Moreover, it nurtured the strength of a soul that was put into the bamboo tip. Both the outside shell and the tip of the brush pen were made of the best materials. It had a good weight, was comfortable to hold, and had a stable brush tip.</p>

  <p>This runic pen was worth at least three supreme life vitality crystals in a market.</p>

  <p>Since Felix was the top runic expert in the Cloud Hall, he, of course, had more than one runic pen. However, this bamboo one was his favorite and he always carried it with him wherever he went.</p>

  <p>"It's fine if you don't want to give me this runic pen," Luo Luo Zheng said to Felix and said no more. But before Luo Luo Zheng could step out of the shop, Felix made up his mind and decided to agree with Luo Luo Zheng. "Okay. If you can show me the perfect brushwork, this runic pen is yours."</p>

  <p>A satisfied smile crossed Luo Zheng's lips. He was willing to showcase his skills in exchange for a free, top runic brush pen. However, when he saw the runic ink Felix brought out, he frowned. "What is this ink for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"This is used for drawing the three-star rune, Sun Flame Rune," Felix answered. The rune he mentioned was a frequently needed one. Many cultivators had asked him to make it, so Felix prepared enough ink and carried it with him all day.</p>

  <p>"I'm not familiar with the Sun Flame Rune. I just started learning how to draw runes and I can only make one-star ones," Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and explained. In fact, Luo Luo Zheng only could draw the one-star meditation rune.</p>

  <p>However, Felix didn't intend for Luo Luo Zheng to make the three-star Sun Flame Rune. He only wanted him to draw a line to show his perfect brushwork.</p>

  <p>Since the materials of the ink and its manufacturing process were both different from Luo Zheng's own meditation divine texture, Luo Luo Zheng then brought out his own ink.</p>

  <p>'He just started learning rune-making a little while ago. He only knows how to draw the one-star rune, but he can draw runes with perfect brushwork. It's so strange, ' Felix thought. 'If he's really a beginner, it would have been hard for him to hold the brush pen perfectly. How can he do perfect brushwork then? It really is unbelievable!' Felix wondered in his mind.</p>

  <p>Then again, Luo Luo Zheng confidently told him he was a starter, so Felix thought that he probably wasn't lying. Felix felt that his case was really weird. It was like a newly born baby that could speak out a profound poem at his first time to open his mouth. It was really beyond Felix's imagination.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Felix decided to keep watching. He really couldn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng could do perfect brushwork. If it was really true, he was willing to give Luo Luo Zheng his precious runic pen, as he thought that it was well worth it.</p>

  <p>A little excitement coursed through Luo Luo Zheng as he held the black runic pen.</p>

  <p>This runic pen was excellent. It was suitable for his hand and felt perfect.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng divided a piece of his soul and put it into the runic pen, he didn't feel cold like before. On the contrary, he felt that a piece of his soul was dipped in warmth. It felt quite comfortable.</p>

  <p>'This runic pen must belong to me!' Luo Luo Zheng mentally told himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he dipped the runic pen in his ink. Then, he started to draw on the paper.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all eyes were on the runic pen's tip, including Felix, Lasseter, and even all the shop's waiters. They didn't believe Luo Luo Zheng and wanted to see how long he could go on with his pretending.</p>

  <p>The moment that the pen tip touched the paper, Luo Luo Zheng had stratified all the materials contained in the ink. He had continuously practiced drawing eight pieces of the runes last night, so he was very familiar with the features of the materials needed to make the meditation rune.</p>

  <p>A beam of cyan light suddenly shone and a perfect line appeared on the paper.</p>

  <p>"Incredible. It's really incredible," Felix repeated to himself. When Felix saw the cyan light, he was so shocked that he couldn't say anything at that moment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lasseter's expression suddenly changed as well. As a member of the World Commercial Alliance, he had a sharp sense. He immediately realized how precious Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng's future achievements probably won't be lesser than Arnold's. Our World Commercial Alliance must keep a good relationship with him at any cost! I have to report this to the headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance!' Lasseter thought.</p>

  <p>A perfect line slowly stretched on the paper. The skill of perfect brushwork was clear in all the energy in the ink. Soon enough, the brush tip had left the paper surface. "This runic pen is mine now, isn't it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked Felix with a smile.</p>
