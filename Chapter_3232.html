<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was said that a soul was as light as a feather. It drifted anywhere, wherever the wind went.</p>

  <p>However, the same rule did not apply in the Other Shore. Souls of Light were heavy. They didn't have the ability to float and fly. Warriors needed a boat to simply cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>When the Soul Binding Threads spread all over an area, it meant that people would move very slowly in that area.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace eagerly wanted to return to the temple to wait for the effect of the Soul Binding Threads to disappear and then they could leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy were moving swiftly through the crowd, unaffected by the Soul Binding Threads at their feet.</p>

  <p>Despite his seeming confidence, Zheng was wary that something bad was going to happen.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race was making bold moves. They even used soul crystal as bait. Seamus wouldn't let go of them easily.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng and Dorothy, leading the crowd, had rushed three to four thousand feet, shadows of altars appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>The altars had steps. They were roughly the size of a house and looked a little unsophisticated.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted his eyes to investigate the altars better. He was clueless as to what those altars were for.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace knew better. They all muttered a gasp of recognition.</p>

  <p>"Champion Fish! These are the Champion Fish Altars!"</p>

  <p>"Where did they get so many Champion Fish Altars?"</p>

  <p>"There are at most ten-odd of them in the Stage Twelve of Other Shore. But here, there must be over a hundred of them!"</p>

  <p>Altars nearly encircled every inch of the arena.</p>

  <p>"What is Champion Fish Altar?" Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy had an Indigo Soul, she also had a similarly limited experience as Zheng when it came to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Luckily, she had heard of Champion Fish. "The Champion Fish is a common creature living in the Other Shore. They like gathering inside altars."</p>

  <p>A huge sea of sand covered Stage Twelve. Within its vicinity, temples of more than ten greatest races stood.</p>

  <p>Almost all of these temples required an Other Shore Key to enter. Only the Champion Fish Temple did not. One could simply come and go as they pleased.</p>

  <p>However, it was a very dangerous place. It posed greater risks than Stage Thirteen. Warriors who had entered the Champion Fish Temple were rumored to have gone downhill. It was common practice for the warriors to avoid the temple altogether.</p>

  <p>Now, the Bearing race had moved so many Champion Fish Altars from Stage Twelve of Other Shore here. No one could figure out how they did it.</p>

  <p>The elites of the Oneness Sky Palace who had been in the Champion Fish Temple were scared. They knew how scary it was and they trembled at the sight of the altars.</p>

  <p>"Rush over," Zheng ordered without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Dorothy said with determination.</p>

  <p>They knew that the longer they stayed, the more vulnerable they became.</p>

  <p>That was another attempt to get rid of them. They had no choice but to fight head-on.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Dorothy were about a thousand feet away from the altars, a mirror suddenly appeared on each of the altars. Fish that looked like carps with thick scales could be seen in the mirrors. On their backs, a pair of wide wings fluttered and tusks were contained in their mouths.</p>

  <p>When the mirrors appeared, fish leapt out until there were more than ten of them on each altar.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish was a creature living within Stage Twelve. They were formidable and terrifying creatures, especially in groups. The warriors gasped in horror. Even the strongest among them trembled with fear, much more those only in the fourth or fifth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>A handful of Champion Fish hurled themselves towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted his eyes. He rolled over and, with a flick of his wrist, purple light beamed from his hand. His fingers transformed into five sharp thorns which allowed him to stab each of the fish that came his way.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>"Blocked?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked mortified.</p>

  <p>It turned out a different technique was needed to approach the fish.</p>

  <p>They were different from the Soul Snakes they had previously fought. The Soul Snakes were much easier to deal with for someone like Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A Champion Fish made contact with Zheng's prickly finger and flopped to the ground. However, in just a matter of seconds, it quickly bounced up and flapped its wings with full momentum. It seemed unfazed by Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>A fierce light flashed in Zheng's eyes. His body flashed with purple light.</p>

  <p>Above him, a white energy cyclone hovered.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>Milo's Heart Slaughtering Strike might be powerful, and he was far more proficient in it than Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Heart Slaughtering Strike's power depended on the strength of the warrior's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had an Indigo Soul now, the invisible Mind Sword became more powerful than Milo's Heart Slaughtering Strike.</p>

  <p>With a swift wave of Zheng's Mind Sword, some of the Champion Fish erupted into pieces.</p>

  <p>Seamus had been observing everything from the back of the Soul Arena.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened at the sight of Zheng using the Mind Sword.</p>

  <p>He thought Milo was already powerful. He did not expect someone else to come forward with the unique ability. However, Zheng was proving himself to be more powerful than Milo. Seamus made a mental note of what he had seen. He knew this was golden information he had to report to his superiors.</p>

  <p>The power of the invisible Mind Sword was far beyond the scope of a Soul of Light's ability in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>"You're capable. So what? You'll still end up dead today," Seamus sneered.</p>

  <p>He then ordered his men, "Ask the Divine Farmer race to kill them. Nobody will be spared!"</p>

  <p>Plenty of people from the Divine Farmer race stood as part of the audience.</p>

  <p>Their presence had long been part of the plan.</p>

  <p>After Seamus had given the orders, pink seeds emerged from the edge of the area covered by the Soul Binding Threads. Slowly, the seeds sprouted.</p>

  <p>Soon, they were going to bear fruits.</p>

  <p>As soon as that happened, the fruits withered and started to smoke.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer race were good at making pills and poison. But the smoke wasn't poison; the smoke curtains created a special enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>When the curtains of smoke reached a few hundred feet above ground, members from the Divine Farmer race said in unison, "Condense!"</p>

  <p>The smoke did as ordered. It condensed into a solid round wall that entrapped the disciples within it.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Zheng was occupied battling the Champion Fish. Together with Dorothy, they had killed at least forty of those fish.</p>

  <p>They were surprised to see the weird wall block their way as they reached the altars.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's mind activated. His Mind Sword stabbed the wall of smoke.</p>

  <p>The Mind Sword successfully pierced it but, to Zheng's dismay, it wasn't able to fully penetrate it. There was something strange with the wall. No matter how hard Zheng tried, he could not break it.</p>
