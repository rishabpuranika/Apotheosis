<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2299 A Place Out Of His Control </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Another example would be Ying's Faith Energy, which contained the vitality of life. It was collected by the Queen of Life in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Queen's statue was green, as was the Faith Energy itself, which contained endless life energy.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God established an evil sect, it was possible to possess this black Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's question, the Evil God immediately understood what he meant. He shook his head and said, "It's absolutely impossible. The secret sect is established according to the traditional way, and there can't be any mistakes. Moreover, as you have seen, those believers are not evil people, nor are they able to bring this black Faith Energy. Besides, the statues all over the world are like this."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and looked at his statue. "Well, I didn't feel any evil in this energy, but I don't understand why it is happening like this."</p>

  <p>The problem was that the Faith Energy had poured into stones from which it could no longer be separated, so how could it possibly be used?</p>

  <p>According to accounts of the process of forging the Faith Energy for an ordinary True God, the Faith Energy would automatically flow into the Godly Tile before accumulating, and the Godly Tile was equivalent to the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>But how could these black stones store it?</p>

  <p>'It must be caused by the cultivation of the Primal Chaos Technique, '</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, his brows furrowing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could have obtained a lot from the practice of the Primal Chaos Technique. However, he had encountered a lot more trouble with it than he had expected. In spite of that, he had succeeded in gathering the Godly Tile in the end. Now, he encountered a new problem.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was thinking, the Evil God seemed to remember something, and said with a pensive expression, "Creator, there are some strange things in the world, and there are also some things... It looks like these black stones..." He trailed off, not quite knowing how to put his thoughts into words. He looked up at Luo Luo Zheng, hoping that he would somehow understand what he was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Creator, please follow me," the Evil God said, and as he spoke, he had passed through space itself, teleporting himself to another continent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately followed suit, his figure disappearing into space, following the Evil God to his destination.</p>

  <p>The land in his inner world split into seven pieces. Tens of thousands of years ago, the continent before his eyes was called the Monster Slaughtering Continent. This continent had been connected to the World Tree since those ancient times, and the local warriors thought of the green creatures on the World Tree as monsters and had spent many years fighting against them, giving the continent its name.</p>

  <p>"Creator, that is the place I spoke about," the Evil God said, pointing ahead.</p>

  <p>He was pointing towards a hilly area of the Monster Slaughtering Continent, part of which was shrouded in a faint golden light. The area covered by the glow resembled a huge gourd.</p>

  <p>Astonishment appeared on Luo Zheng's face, and he asked, "Where did the golden light come from?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to know all things in this world. However, no matter how intensely he sought for it with his mind, he couldn't figure out where the golden light came from. In other words, the place bathed in the golden light was outside of his control.</p>

  <p>He couldn't understand why; it frustrated him that he could not control the world he had created himself.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It seems to have appeared soon after you condensed the Godly Tile. The golden light has a strong innate repulsive force. If one wishes to enter, he or she can only do so through the entrance in that 'gourd'," said the Evil God, who flew down directly, aiming at the entrance of the gourd-shaped space.</p>

  <p>'It's a gourd-shaped area, and there's only one entrance...' thought Luo Luo Zheng for a moment, and then proceeded to step inside.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the area, he saw the forest in front of him shake as several burly blue giants emerged from it. These giants had two heads with three eyes on each, and their faces were ferocious and terrifying. They opened their mouths, exposing a pair of razor-sharp fangs. With a roar, they took off towards Luo Luo Zheng at breakneck speed, and the ground shook beneath their strong, muscular legs.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a thin strip of snow appeared silently in front of Luo Luo Zheng. It formed a circle around the double-headed giants, all without making a sound. However, the silence did not last long. With a sudden whirring sound, the giants were engulfed in the azure Ice Soul Flame and turned into ice sculptures in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>It was the Evil God who had done this.</p>

  <p>"Ice Soul Flame... You've mastered it perfectly," whispered Luo Luo Zheng with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your praise," said the Evil God, cupping his hands together, a hint of triumph on his face. He had the skills to feel superior to anyone in the world, and yet the only person he truly respected was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I have been here once before. These double-headed giants are not that powerful, but there are some giants like them who have ten eyes, and others with hundred eyes and even a thousand eyes. The more eyes they have, the more powerful they are. The last time I couldn't defeat the giant with a thousand eyes and had to return," added the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"There are creatures more powerful than you?!" Luo Luo Zheng had a strange expression on his face.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, the Evil God was much more talented than the majority of geniuses he had seen, and whenever he made some breakthrough, the Evil God would always be the first of his kind to reach the maximum level that the laws of the world could permit.</p>

  <p>The idea of a being or entity that the Evil God couldn't resist was unfathomable to Luo Luo Zheng. If there was such a being, it should be Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>"Take me there," Luo Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>The two of them then proceeded to move, single file, through the gourd-shaped area.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God had said, there were indeed all kinds of giants inside the special area covered by the golden light. Most of them had only a few eyes, but some of them even had eyes all over their bodies, which made them look very strange and frightening, as if these creatures should not exist at all.</p>

  <p>The more eyes a giant had and the bigger it was, the greater its strength would be.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, leading the way, the Evil God could easily deal with those three-eyed and ten-eyed giants. The hundred-eyed giants appearing later, however, were more difficult to deal with. Although there were not many of them, the Evil God usually needed more than a hundred rounds before he could kill them.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said, and as he did, he stretched out his finger and pointed at the three one hundred-eyed giants surrounding the Evil God. The Nine Divine Stars in the sky flashed, and an invisible force descended from them, instantly tearing these hundred-eyed giants into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Luo Luo Zheng said quietly. Now it was his turn to lead the way.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled. The last time he had broken into this place, he had taken a huge risk, and had almost died trying to fight the thousand-eyed giant alone.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Luo Zheng finally found the thousand-eyed giant that the Evil God had mentioned. This giant was nearly thousands of feet tall, and the surrounding hills looked like tiny pebbles in comparison.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was outside of the area covered by the golden light, he hadn't seen such a huge creature. That meant that the golden light had indeed blinded him. Thinking of this, he felt an indescribably strange feeling in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Aww!"</p>

  <p>The giant turned and all its eyes focused at once on Luo Luo Zheng and the Evil God. Without saying anything, it aimed at them with its mountain-sized fist, about to punch them.</p>

  <p>As the fist moved towards them, almost in slow motion, so enormous it blotted out the sky, Luo Luo Zheng calmly pointed at it with his finger, just as he had done before. The fist suddenly stopped in midair, unable to go any further. Then, with a gentle flick, a much fiercer force overpowered the huge monster.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The thousand-eyed giant collapsed, and the force of its fall started a tremendous earthquake. As the land continued to shake, the giants in the depths of the forest began to scream, one after another.</p>

  <p>The giant wanted to get up again, but Luo Luo Zheng had already jumped onto it and stood on its mountain-like head. As Luo Luo Zheng stomped on it, the giant's head became pressed further and further into the ground. Unable to pull its head out, it could only wave its giant arms in vain. Although the giant had a thousand eyes, it seemed unable to see anything.</p>

  <p>"This creature shouldn't have been born in my inner world, and such a powerful creature couldn't have been formed overnight," Luo Luo Zheng said to the Evil God. The human race and the other intelligent creatures in his inner world had all undergone a great amount of tribulations, and they had thus gradually evolved into what they were today.</p>

  <p>"I think so too," said the Evil God, passing the giant's body and then entering the forest as if looking for something in its depths. Soon, he came back with a number of black objects in his hands. The Evil God stretched out his arms, presenting them to Luo Luo Zheng, and said, "Creator, look: I think these black objects, too, contain the Faith Energy."</p>

  <p>The black objects in his hands were thin. As Luo Luo Zheng observed them, his eyes suddenly showed disbelief. "They...they're divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>This time, it was the Evil God's turn to be confused. "Divine might coins? What are they?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief. He had figured it out. "I think I know what this place is," he uttered.</p>
