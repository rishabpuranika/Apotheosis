<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3327 Into The Dark Region </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy continuously activated the Necklace of Mystic Soul, forcing it to its maximum power, as she retreated.</p>

  <p>She was heading towards the opposite direction from the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple. Up ahead, the Dark Region waited for her.</p>

  <p>Even though she knew she would die once she reached the Dark Region, right now, she had no choice but to keep running.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>She heard the little soul swords slashing from behind her. Suddenly, a clanging noise wrung through the air.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, startled at the noise, turned to look over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, a shining golden hand firmly held the blade of one of the soul swords.</p>

  <p>"The Golden Body race?" Dorothy felt her heart sink.</p>

  <p>While there were many native races in these thirteen stages on the Other Shore, the Golden Body race was one of the most powerful.</p>

  <p>The Golden Body race looked very similar to the human race in both figure and height.</p>

  <p>However, the main difference was that their bodies were made of pure, luminescent gold. Consequently, they were much more powerful than other ordinary creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>To Dorothy's despair, the man from the Golden Body race had actually stopped her soul sword with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>With little effort, the man of gold crushed the soul sword. Then, in a strange, tinny voice, he said, "Young human girl, you'd better stop resisting.</p>

  <p>I don't want to make things difficult for you, but we have agreed to help the Bearing race."</p>

  <p>From behind the man, Dorothy could see dozens more of the Golden Body race standing calmly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's mind whirled. She was alone. Even all the Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Thirteen couldn't defeat so many creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even now, Dorothy was not concerned about her own safety. Desperately, she summoned another soul sword from the Necklace of Mystic Soul.</p>

  <p>She had reached her limit at this point.</p>

  <p>"Why did you agree to help the Bearing race?" Dorothy asked coldly, trying to buy some time.</p>

  <p>To persuade an entire race from the Other Shore to help another race, the reward must have been precious. However, it should've been impossible for the Bearing race to be willing to pay such a high price just to deal with a little girl like Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"They have promised us great profits." The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"They have to hire people to deal with me?" Dorothy taunted through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"You?" The man sneered. "You flatter yourself. Why would we bother ourselves to deal with one pathetic Soul of Light?"</p>

  <p>"Ajay, quit talking nonsense with her!"</p>

  <p>"Just take her down!"</p>

  <p>"That man will definitely come to us once he hears the news. You don't need to wait here!" the people from the Bearing race said one after the other.</p>

  <p>At this point, Dorothy understood everything.</p>

  <p>Zheng had destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, snatched their soul crystal, and even killed Haider at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Bearing race wanted revenge. They wanted to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, they were too weak to face Zheng upfront. They wanted the Oneness Sky Palace to hand Zheng over, but the Oneness Sky Palace refused to admit that Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>With no evidence, the Bearing race was at a loss. They couldn't set themselves against the Oneness Sky Palace because of Zheng. Too many things were involved, and they hadn't been well prepared.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they resorted to having creatures from the Other Shore do the dirty work for them. That would explain why the mighty Golden Body race was helping them.</p>

  <p>The golden man who went by Ajay stopped the chitchat. Instead, he bolted towards Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy bit her lip. She knew she wouldn't be able to face Ajay head on.</p>

  <p>She couldn't even face the Abyss Spirit race back in Stage Eleven, let alone a mighty creature from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The three soul swords shot towards Ajay.</p>

  <p>However, Ajay didn't even flinch. He stretched out his hand, and swatted the soul swords away, as though they were just annoying flies.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Ajay chuckled. The swords barely even slowed him down; in fact, to Dorothy's horror, it seemed he picked up his speed.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, she whipped around and fled towards the darkness.</p>

  <p>She was now very close to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region was a dangerous place for the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Even as she approached the border of the Dark Region, she felt fear welling within her.</p>

  <p>"Candles... If only I had some candles!"</p>

  <p>She could've temporarily hidden in the Dark Region, if only she had candles.</p>

  <p>But when the three-eyed boy let her go, she had given all the candles to Feng Ge, who stored them in her space ring.</p>

  <p>Now, the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race guarded the Dark Region from both sides. Behind her, the Golden Body race was steadily closing in.</p>

  <p>Just as she was only a few steps away from the Dark Region, she abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>"Young human girl, don't take another step," Ajay called. "The Dark Region is very dangerous."</p>

  <p>Creatures on the Other Shore were forbidden from entering the Dark Region, too. The creatures from the Light Region were completely different from those of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Dorothy apprehensively took a few steps backward. As she got closer to the Dark Region, she also felt increasingly desperate.</p>

  <p>She knew that Zheng was still alive, so she still held onto a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>However, if she was caught by them, they were bound to use her as bait to lure Zheng out. If Zheng managed to get out of the Dark Region, he'd have to face numerous opponents all at once, all because of her.</p>

  <p>'What should I do?' Dorothy turned around, facing her chasers.</p>

  <p>Ever since she met Zheng, she had encountered many dangers on the Other Shore. However, each time, Zheng had saved her. This time, now that he wasn't by her side, she knew she didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"Young girl, don't step back. You'd die," said Ajay. "Don't worry. You won't die at our hands!"</p>

  <p>After all, their goal was only to hold Dorothy as hostage till Zheng showed up.</p>

  <p>They needed her alive.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid that I'll suffer bitterly," Dorothy retorted, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she took another step backward, toward the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure about that?"</p>

  <p>Ajay laughed. While Dorothy had been lost in her thoughts, he suddenly closed the distance and grabbed her by the arm. Dorothy snapped back to reality. 'Huh? Wasn't he still a few steps away from me?'</p>

  <p>Dorothy panicked. How could she have been so stupid!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a white light flashed from the Dark Region. A hand reached out from the light and grabbed Dorothy, yanking her into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Ajay jumped back in surprise, letting go of Dorothy. He broke out a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" he cursed.</p>

  <p>The others behind him shook their heads in disappointment. They never expected that this young woman from the Oneness Sky Palace would be so fiercely determined. They couldn't believe she was willing to run into the Dark Region just to escape their clutches.</p>
