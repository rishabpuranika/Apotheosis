  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God entered the stone gate, he felt the weight of the black smog. He paused slightly.</p>

  <p>He shivered a bit, but soon adapted to it.</p>

  <p>The black smog obscured the light, but after adjusting to the darkness, his eyes soon caught sight of Garrett sprinting away.</p>

  <p>"Humph," the Evil God snorted.</p>

  <p>With a small hop, he launched himself straight at Garrett, hurtling through the air like a bird of prey.</p>

  <p>Garrett had seen him all this while, looking back as he moved forward.</p>

  <p>His face fell as soon as he spotted the Evil God in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Garrett was sure he could take on the Evil God, but he had no intention of confronting him now.</p>

  <p>But who would be happy with a lunatic hunting them for no reason?</p>

  <p>"Toad Pace!"</p>

  <p>At this, Garrett accelerated.</p>

  <p>His steps now followed a special rule. He could still move forward at high speed even with the black smog in his way.</p>

  <p>"So, you choose to flee?"</p>

  <p>A cold light flashed in the Evil God's eyes. He picked up his speed behind Garrett. It seemed like he would soon overtake him.</p>

  <p>The distance between them began to close quickly.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Garrett panicked.</p>

  <p>"How could he be so fast?!"</p>

  <p>The black smog should have had the same effect on the Evil God as on him.</p>

  <p>The former hadn't gone into the higher stage of the Other Shore Realm, so he shouldn't be much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Realizing he could not get rid of the Evil God, Garrett stopped in his tracks with a new resolve.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands, pulled out two machetes from his belt, and faced the oncoming threat head-on. "I have no enmity with you! Why are you chasing me?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God halted, excitement dancing in his eyes. He let out a sinister laugh. "You know the answer!"</p>

  <p>At his words, Garrett's face darkened. With a flash, a snake shadow appeared and crawled along the surface of each machete.</p>

  <p>It was an Other Shore Treasure, and there was a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen merged with it.</p>

  <p>"You want to fight me?" Garrett spat out, a deadly warning in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Fight? Haha!" The Evil God sneered and raised his right hand. "I want to kill you."</p>

  <p>As soon as these words were spoken, he flung out five pieces of diamond-shaped fragments from his palm.</p>

  <p>These diamond-shaped fragments were all made of the Ways-blending Energy. They broke the black smog, obliterating the dust while emitting a little white light.</p>

  <p>"What kind of power is this?"</p>

  <p>Garrett's pupils shrank slightly. His face took on a serious expression as he swung his machetes.</p>

  <p>"Heaven and Earth Radiance Hacking!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two rays of blade radiance formed a cross. The snake shadows coiled around the radiance, and then struck at the diamond-shaped fragments.</p>

  <p>Garrett might not be the strongest among the young generation of the Bearing race, but he was strong enough to be in the top five among hundreds of his peers. That he deployed his treasured weapons indicated that he thought highly of his opponent now.</p>

  <p>The Heaven and Earth Radiance Hacking would have been a normal attack, but with his Other Shore Token attached to it, it could nearly devour all the energy in the world.</p>

  <p>It could even swallow the Other Shore Power!</p>

  <p>However, when the blade radiance came into contact with the diamond-shaped fragments, an astonishingly cataclysmic power burst out. The dazzling white light went through the black smog, obscuring Garrett's view.</p>

  <p>Garrett stayed calm. He closed his eyes and spread his spiritual sense in all directions.</p>

  <p>But just as he did, a powerful soul pressure rushed toward him!</p>

  <p>The spiritual sense acted as appendages for a soul. These appendages could spread far away and fast, but they were thin and extremely fragile.</p>

  <p>The soul pressure destroyed Garrett's spiritual sense violently. Unable to locate the Evil God, Garrett began to feel afraid.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had seized the chance to approach behind him. He stretched out his hand and flung a diamond-shaped fragment at the back of Garrett's head.</p>

  <p>Two people around a thousand feet away were watching these events unfold.</p>

  <p>One of them, a tall and strong young man, had a girl with curly hair seated on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>This girl was Mya, treasured by many elders of the Divine Farmer race. The race had high hopes for her entry into the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The origin of the strapping young man was rather more mysterious. Only a few members of the Divine Farmer race knew his true identity. He was named Mount.</p>

  <p>Mya usually called him Uncle Mount.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, are you really not going to help him?" asked Mya, pouting her rosy lips.</p>

  <p>Her face was covered by her curly hair, but under all that was a pair of pretty eyes.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race were as close as brothers.</p>

  <p>Before they set out, their leader had instructed that no matter what happened, they should help each other with the Sun Crow race and the Bearing race in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Garrett was a very important disciple of the Bearing race, so they were supposed to help him.</p>

  <p>"Garrett won't die anyway. Why don't we just watch for now?" Mount replied gently.</p>

  <p>Although the Soul Devouring Demon was widely known in many races, they didn't appear afraid of him at all.</p>

  <p>Strong people tended to be lonesome and arrogant. Being among the top ranks of the extremely powerful, they had never thought that they were inferior to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the energy in that man's hand is the Ways-blending Energy, and that he has integrated many..." Mya slightly curled her hair with a finger. "Having fused the Godly Ways to such a degree, this guy is by no means weak..."</p>

  <p>"It's just a fusion of different Godly Ways. What's the big deal?" Mount raised his hand, radiating a colorful glow from his fingertips, which contained at least two thousand different Godly Ways that had been blended.</p>

  <p>As Mya looked at the beautiful Ways-blending Energy, a smile played at the corners of her mouth. She sighed, "Uncle Mount, you really are omnipotent..."</p>

  <p>"Blending Godly Ways is not as difficult as you think. As long as you have enough time, you can make it, too. But it's difficult to activate its power. I just don't know where this young man learned the method to get more than a hundred layers of Ways-blending Energy, making it as powerful as an Other Shore Token," Mount mused somberly.</p>

  <p>As they watched, the Evil God moved to embed a diamond-shaped fragment into the back of Garrett's head.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was certain that Garrett would die, but just then, a brown ball appeared at the top of his head. As the ball cracked, a layer of transparent enamel covered Garrett's body.</p>

  <p>The enamel firmly armored Garrett. It appeared as delicate as porcelain.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God soon learned it was not. He could not break through it at all!</p>
