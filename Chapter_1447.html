<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1447 Windy Tunnels </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All of this happened in a span of just three seconds.</p>

  <p>Awais had activated the divine texture when he had knocked into those blades, causing his body to become engulfed in the purple light as he came to a standstill. And then, the purple light tugged at him forcefully and pulled him out of the blades.</p>

  <p>He would have been sliced into pieces if he had been any slower.</p>

  <p>But he was already heavily wounded, his body having been riddled with several terrifying bruises and cuts. And now that he had used the divine texture, there was no chance for him to return to the Endless Abyss for a second time.</p>

  <p>Since Awais was one of the top geniuses of the sacred place of the ogres, this showdown had resulted in a burning resentment towards Luo Luo Zheng. As he was pulled back by the purple light, he roared at Luo Luo Zheng who was down in the abyss, "You brat! Even if you can survive the abyss, I can guarantee that you won't be able to leave the Dark World alive!"</p>

  <p>The other ogre warrior wasn't as lucky as Awais. He hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to crash this suddenly into him. Having been caught off guard, he hadn't had the time to even react before two intersecting blades cut through his body into pieces.</p>

  <p>Nobody would blame Luo Luo Zheng for this warrior's death, though. They all knew that Awais had caused it.</p>

  <p>The tragic end of the two ogre warriors caused everyone to look at Luo Luo Zheng in what could only be a mix of caution and trepidation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been ambushed by Awais, but had reacted quite quickly, leaving him unharmed. He had also managed to take revenge and wound two ogre warriors. He was undoubtedly an opponent that couldn't be trifled with, whether in terms of intelligence or strength.</p>

  <p>What made this even more incredible was that he was only at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the two ogre warriors had found themselves in such a miserable situation, most of the warriors now refrained from competing with each other. If one of them tried to struggle with another for a gap between the blades like Awais had done, they would most likely end up in pieces.</p>

  <p>The blades finally disappeared after about an hour. Just as everyone began getting curious about the next trap, someone suddenly shouted,</p>

  <p>"Look! There's a platform down there!"</p>

  <p>There had been nothing for them to cling on to ever since they had entered the underground palace and started falling into the abyss. But the appearance of the platform had immediately attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"Let's go there!" a Demon Night woman ordered, her golden hair swishing with her every gesture.</p>

  <p>The other warriors of the Demon Night race quickly adjusted their positions and slowly approached the platform that protruded from the wall of the abyss.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warriors had performed their best during this exploration of the underground palace. While some warriors of other races had been killed or wounded when they had passed through the Blade Mountain Trap, not a single one of the Demon Night warriors had been injured.</p>

  <p>"Let's head over as well," Luo Luo Zheng said to his companions.</p>

  <p>Freya nodded. And then, the warriors from the human and the ogre sacred places also moved towards the platform.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>The first to reach the platform was the blonde Demon Night woman.</p>

  <p>Even though she had fallen towards the platform at a great speed, she hadn't made too much noise. Her strength was coordinated and she had evenly distributed her power between her feet, legs, and waist.</p>

  <p>All other members of the Demon Night race followed her actions.</p>

  <p>The human warriors, on the other hand, each used a different method to land safely. Freya crossed her hands, streams of cold air gathering in square blocks of ice under her feet. These blocks shattered into pieces as she fell onto the platform because of the great momentum. But with them as a buffer, Freya arrived at the platform steadily.</p>

  <p>The thought of using any skills didn't even cross the minds of the ogre warriors. They relied entirely on their powerful bodies to crash onto the platform.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>They crashed down one after another like meteors, causing the entire platform to shake.</p>

  <p>Some warriors were worried that these casual participants might break down the platform. But they knew that the ogres usually were outrageous and domineering in behavior, which was why they remained silent despite their worries.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng landed on the platform, his gaze roamed around it. At the end of the platform was a cave.</p>

  <p>"This cave...," Luo Luo Zheng muttered, before deciding to ask his companions about it.</p>

  <p>But Xun interrupted him. "This is the first trial of the Endless Abyss. Whether or not you can obtain the reward will depend on your own abilities."</p>

  <p>The golden-haired woman from the Demon Night race had already led her race members into the cave.</p>

  <p>Xun's words propelled Luo Luo Zheng into action and he walked unhesitatingly into the cave. The rest followed close behind.</p>

  <p>This cave was rather narrow but the humans and the Demon Night members could still pass through it without any problem. The burly ogres, however, had to nearly squeeze through this narrow passage. They swore and cursed as they moved slowly forward into the cave, their voices echoing angrily.</p>

  <p>As they moved forward, they heard the sharp howls of winds emanating from the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>The gusts blew fiercely.</p>

  <p>The whistling sound of these winds actually contained some sort of a rhythm, as if someone were playing a flute. Each sound was different in its pitch.</p>

  <p>Nothing unexpected happened in this abyss, so even though everyone was puzzled as to why there were such strong winds and such strange sounds, no one asked or said anything. They just silently advanced.</p>

  <p>After a while, the originally narrow path suddenly ended, revealing the entrance to another gigantic cave.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept across the cave. He estimated this cave to be over a hundred thousand feet wide, and as high as ten mountains being stacked on top of each other.</p>

  <p>Since this Supreme Lord was able to create a bottomless abyss, nobody was surprised to see such a large cave here.</p>

  <p>Wild winds flowed swiftly within this cave at a frightening speed.</p>

  <p>The wind blades needed certain conditions to be fulfilled in order to be created, which was why there were no wind blades from these gales. For example, wind blades of different shapes and sizes could be created by living beings when they deliberately used the Wind Law, or when violent gales collided with each other.</p>

  <p>But the winds here were moving in some kind of a pattern. They were fierce and contained a shocking power of the Wind Law, but they didn't form any wind blades under some kind of artificial arrangement.</p>

  <p>"Look! What's that?"</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a Rebirth Vine on the other side of the cave!"</p>

  <p>"It's really a Rebirth Vine!"</p>

  <p>"Hey, didn't you see that? There is a cluster of Flowery Fire Grass on top of that stone pillar!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>Every Demon Night member, human, and ogre stared around the cave, their eyes wide as they took in the rare treasures and resources that filled this cave.</p>

  <p>These treasures were precious, even to a tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>"How can we get there? Can we fly over to the other side?" someone asked.</p>

  <p id="top_22">Since they were not within the Endless Abyss, some of them tried to float to the sky but quickly discovered that they still couldn't fly.</p>

  <p>"How can we get our hands on those treasures if we can't fly?" a warrior complained.</p>

  <p>The blonde woman from the Demon Night race glanced around again and said, "Over there!"</p>

  <p>Everyone followed her gaze and found that there was a row of naturally formed stone platforms on this side of the cave. They could see the whole row of platforms from where they were standing.</p>

  <p>There were a total of over a hundred stone platforms, and at the bottom of each platform was a circular windy tunnel.</p>

  <p>The tunnels were an explanation to the melodious wind they had encountered. Strong gales blew out of these tunnels, and when these gales rushed out from below the stone platforms, it sounded like someone was whistling. The different sizes of these platforms resulted in different pitches of the sounds, making it sound like someone was playing a flute.</p>

  <p>The blonde woman jumped onto a stone platform and bent to observe the windy tunnel below. After a while, she turned to the others and said, "It looks like every windy tunnel has a different route."</p>

  <p>"You are right! If we enter different windy tunnels, we will arrive at different positions on the other side and obtain different treasures!" someone said and many other warriors agreed with this.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a human warrior pointed to the top of the cave and shouted excitedly, "Look! What's that at the top of the cave?"</p>
