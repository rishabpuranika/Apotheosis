<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 593 Heavenly Fruit Tree (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>His mouth hung open at the sight of so many treasure boxes. And the young disciple remained this way for quite a while until his face felt stiff and numb.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the silver box, Luo Zheng successfully obtained the manual of 'Malicious Wheel of Life and Death' left by the Blood Fiend Emperor.</p>

  <p>With this ability, Luo Zheng could become more powerful. Now, he wondered what the golden boxes and the black box contained.</p>

  <p>And the temptation to find out was so great!</p>

  <p>"Have you ever gotten any of the boxes?" Tia suddenly asked Luo Zheng. The question came out of nowhere as Luo Zheng continued to stare at the treasure boxes.</p>

  <p>Shrugging his shoulders, Luo Zheng nodded modestly.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the boxes again, and Tia found there were only three silver boxes remaining. But there were once four of them. Tia knitted her brows as she asked, "You did get three treasure boxes, right? Did you take the silver box?"</p>

  <p>There was a total of five silver treasure boxes in the valley. With the head of the Cloud Hall taking away one of them, there had still been four of them left. But now she could only see three. It was obvious that someone else took one too, so Tia turned to Luo Zheng to ask.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng nodded, Tia was taken aback. She was well aware of how tough it was to get the silver box.</p>

  <p>Although she was capable of getting the box, too, Tia only tried doing it once. It was by accident at a later time when she found out the real secret behind the Cloud Road trial. Since then, she decided never to waste her time on the Sea of Raging Fire.</p>

  <p>Because no matter how powerful she was, it was still impossible for her to get all the treasure boxes at the same time. It was more advisable for her to take the containers once by taking advantage of the crystal key left by the Blood Fiend Emperor.</p>

  <p>Once she took action, Tia had to do her best and get all the boxes in one go.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng, who believed that half of the boxes should be his, was walking closer to the containers and wanted to open one, Tia immediately stopped the disciple and dragged him back.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, something round was falling down in front of them, and it hit the ground with a loud thud, enough to crack the blue bricks.</p>

  <p>That was the blood pool.</p>

  <p>Although the blood pool crashed heavily on the ground, the flood dragon's blood was viscous that none of it spattered out of the pool. The spurting blood beads would always bounce back in the pool.</p>

  <p>"Well... What is it?" Luo Zheng asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>Although unfamiliar with the blood pool, Luo Zheng knew this was extraordinary based on the scent of the blood in the pool.</p>

  <p>"The pool is full of flood dragon's blood. You can soak yourself there later. For now, however, just stay here and don't move around because there will be other things dropping down," Tia told Luo Zheng. She felt discontented now. And one of her flaws was being inconsistent. Tia clearly disliked Luo Zheng, so it was a wonder that she had saved him just now.</p>

  <p>Why didn't she just let the blood pool kill him? This way, it wouldn't be her fault even if he was killed. And it would make no difference to her will of martial arts.</p>

  <p>However, it would be a waste to get rid of a talented fighter like Luo Zheng, who deserved high-grade training, Tia argued in her head. It would be a great loss for Cloud Hall if the disciple ended up being killed by the blood pool.</p>

  <p>This was the excellent excuse that came to Tia's mind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a big bang shook them.</p>

  <p>At this time, there was something else falling down from the sky. It was a fruit tree with ten fruits. The size, color, and luster of each fruit were different from each other.</p>

  <p>And Tia couldn't hide her surprise and happiness when she saw this particular fruit tree.</p>

  <p>"A Heavenly Fruit Tree!"</p>

  <p>Like most people, Tia had never seen a Heavenly Fruit Tree before. They mostly only heard about it through legends. In the Central Region, nobody else would have ever seen this tree.</p>

  <p>It was at a secret auction in the Central Region where Tia had seen a heavenly fruit by chance. After being preserved for thousands of years, the fruit still remained plump and full. According to the auctioneer's description, it was the fruit of the Heavenly Fruit Tree.</p>

  <p>Legend had it that there were only a total of ten heavenly fruits in the world. Each time one of the ten fruits was eaten, a new one would grow in the Heavenly Fruit Tree. However, there would never be more than ten fruits in the tree.</p>

  <p>Besides, each heavenly fruit functioned differently. And with the magical effects from every fruit, they became extremely precious.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect that the Heavenly Fruit Tree was planted in Cloud Road. And I didn't know that it once belonged to the Blood Fiend Emperor. It is beyond my expectation. It is really hard to imagine how powerful and strong his sect was!" Tia muttered. "There are ten fruits in the Heavenly Fruit Tree now. This means that the one at the secret auction was eaten by someone. Otherwise, there won't be ten in the tree!"</p>

  <p>It made Luo Zheng wonder why Tia was so excited and happy. But it was easy for him to assume how extraordinary the tree was. He believed that half of the treasure here was his. And since there were ten fruits in the tree, he felt it was reasonable for him to eat five of them. It was truly an excellent deal.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng wondered how delicious the heavenly fruits would be, another shadow hovered in the sky. Then the shadow dropped straight down and was embedded on the ground.</p>

  <p>What fell was a grand sword that was ten feet high.</p>
