<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned at the power surging within him.</p>

  <p>"What strong power!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was so strong that he rarely felt any pressure under any amount of force.</p>

  <p>He had hardly been able to bear the Ways-blending Energy earlier. He felt that the Other Shore Power he had obtained from the Strength God Totem was going to leave him feeling the same way.</p>

  <p>Two sharp knocks sounded at the door.</p>

  <p>"Darling, what's going on?"</p>

  <p>Margaret's voice sounded, muffled from across the door.</p>

  <p>Zheng was in seclusion and no one was allowed to enter the room. But the people outside had become worried at the loud noise.</p>

  <p>"Just a small accident," Zheng called back.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a few seconds before Margaret spoke, her voice full of concern. "Please be careful," she said. She waited for an answer but when he didn't respond, she turned and left.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for Margaret to understand the kind of cultivation method or power that Zheng had acquired and whether or not he would spiral into madness.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand and a ray of green light gathered around his arm, instantly healing the injury.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred divine megatons is my limit?"</p>

  <p>Zheng murmured as he stretched his arm out again.</p>

  <p>The black spot on his arm began to expand and had soon covered his whole arm, turning it into one smooth black expanse.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone could strengthen his corporeal body, but he was still not sure of the limits it would give him.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng released four hundred divine megatons of force in one go.</p>

  <p>Under the horrifying force, his arm was still strong as before.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>He felt a sharp pain searing his arm, but he told himself he could bear it.</p>

  <p>"Six hundred divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>"Seven hundred divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>It was under the seven hundred divine megatons that a crisp crack rang out from his arm.</p>

  <p>The bones of his arm had broken under the pressure.</p>

  <p>Zheng withdrew his strength, frowning.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Shade Stone could greatly strengthen his body.</p>

  <p>But it was not enough.</p>

  <p>The body was made up of internal organs, flesh, muscles, and bones, and the Shade Stone could only protect some parts of his body. He wished he could get his hands on a few more Shade Stones, because if he did and his body absorbed them, it would improve his physical strength multi-fold.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone, however, was a grain of sand falling from the sand clock, and it was usually close to impossible to look for it, leave alone collect it.</p>

  <p>After a series of tests, Zheng lifted the enchanted barrier and left his room.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had been in seclusion, Nelly, Liusu, Xun, and Margaret had been chatting with Carrie in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Margaret did not seem to be interested in the talk. But she had nowhere else to go and her face reflected the boredom she felt.</p>

  <p>"Darling, you've come out!" Margaret's eyes glowed with excitement as she watched Zheng descend the staircase from the second floor.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Zheng said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Nelly pursed her lips as she said, "Zheng, I want to go to Dragon City."</p>

  <p>"Me too," Xun said.</p>

  <p>"Count me in as well," said Liusu, a soft smile playing on her lips.</p>

  <p>Yudie and Margaret had stopped their cultivation, but these three hadn't.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had settled down in the Source World, they wanted to explore and gain experience.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that the Killing Godly Way that I cultivate is suitable for the Killing Sword Sect. If I can cross the Sea of Truth, I want to join the Killing Sword Sect," said Nelly.</p>

  <p>They had learned more about the Source World in recent times through Trish and Carrie.</p>

  <p>"The three of you want to go to the Dragon City?"</p>

  <p>The star light in the Dragon City made it possible for them to improve their strength with half the effort. They could easily go to Dragon City with enough Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Liusu and Nelly were top martial artists in the divine land as well as in the Source World. Xun wasn't that far behind either. That was why it would be a waste of time and talent for them to remain in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Can we?" Nelly asked, staring at Zheng with her big, innocent eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. "It's not a problem. The Dragon City belongs to the Oneness Sky Palace, but there are no established rules. It's very dangerous, and the competition there is fierce."</p>

  <p>Zheng was warning them only because he was worried about their safety.</p>

  <p>They had a thorough understanding of the situation in the Dragon City, so they knew what was on Zheng's mind. They assured Zheng that they would take good care of themselves, and only after these fervent reassurances did Zheng finally agree.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City was undoubtedly a dangerous place, but they were old hands. What was more, Monica would take care of them. It was only on these conditions that Zheng finally granted their request.</p>

  <p>"But..." Zheng hesitated, his gaze finding Xun's.</p>

  <p>"I can change to practice swordsmanship," Xun said immediately, gauging what Zheng was thinking.</p>

  <p>Zheng then turned to look at Margaret, who shook her head. "I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with you!"</p>

  <p>With Margaret's talent, she would find the Unique Array Sword Sect suitable for her. But she was not in the mood to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Discussion aside, it wouldn't be easy for them to just march into the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Even if they had the help of the Sword-reading Liquid, they needed to cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent from the very beginning, something that would take ordinary people a long time to cultivate. The upside, however, was that the use of the Sword-reading Liquid could greatly improve their compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent in a short period of time. But the effect didn't last for a long time. They couldn't afford it even if they were rich.</p>

  <p>Zheng could give them a large amount of Sword-reading Liquid. At the very least, they could recite a part of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent in the short time they were given.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, the three women matched well with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and their cultivation progress was impressive enough. They continued to take the Sword-reading Liquid and in half a month, had cultivated a foundation that Zheng hadn't thought possible before.</p>

  <p>He then personally took the three women down the mountain, climbed over the Sword Wall, and entrusted them to Monica.</p>

  <p>Monica's eyes widened when she saw them. It was obvious that she wanted to say something, but words failed her.</p>

  <p>Zheng spent some time with the disciples in the Dragon City and then went up the mountain again.</p>

  <p>He returned to his courtyard house and was surprised to find that Imran had come to visit him. Imran had reached the seventh floor of the Flow Tower and had become qualified to live in an independent courtyard house as well.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," Imran greeted Zheng, saluting respectfully.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had made it to the tenth floor of the Flow Tower in one go, his name had become well known across the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Flow Sword Sect, both those who owned the independent courtyard houses and the ordinary ones, had almost achieved nothing of late.</p>

  <p>Rumor was that it was because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, mind cultivating was a significant characteristic of the Flow Sword Sect. On the day of Zheng's performance, they had been so shocked that his performance had been so good.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Imran! What can I do for you?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The elite disciples of the Flow Sword Sect have a gathering today. They have sent me to invite you. May I have the honor?" Imran said, bowing slightly.</p>

  <p>Those who lived in the separate courtyard houses had formed a new clique.</p>

  <p>More than twenty disciples in this area were the future hope of the Flow Sword Sect, and they often got together.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had focused on his cultivation and had never visited his neighbors ever since he had moved in.</p>
