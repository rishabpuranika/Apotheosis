<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 741 The Corpse Parasite </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Owen was a warrior who boasted about his fast speed. He practiced the cultivation method of the wind system, and furthermore, he had completely comprehended the first layer of Wind Law.</p>

  <p>In terms of his comprehension of Wind Law, Owen was already on par with Luo Zheng. But no one knew what sort of lucky chance Owen had received to comprehend Wind Law.</p>

  <p>However, this was the world of martial artists. Those with extraordinary talents often had good luck. Since Owen had divine-level talent, it wasn't strange for him to have such a lucky opportunity.</p>

  <p>However, Marilyn's technique was unique. Even with Owen's comprehension of Wind Law, he was unable to catch up with her.</p>

  <p>After failing several times, Owen used the secret art of beast transmogrifying.</p>

  <p>"What is that? Why has Owen's body changed?"</p>

  <p>"He is too fast. I can't see the transformation clearly. Tell me. What has he changed into?"</p>

  <p>"He's transformed into a leopard. Judging from those lines, it could be a legendary beast, the Cloud Leopard! He possesses the blood of the Cloud Leopard, and the concentration in his blood must be very high, which is why he can transform into a beast!"</p>

  <p>Amongst the many practitioners, there were still some who knew a lot.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Leopard was a legendary beast. Even though it couldn't compare with a super legendary beast, it was on par with the Blue Phoenix, the Roc, the Heavenly Mouse, and other legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>Merely having a legendary beast's blood in a cultivator's body was insufficient for him to transform into a beast. For example, Luo Zheng had the blood of the Genuine Dragon, but he was unable to change into a dragon because the blood concentration was not high enough. Only when the blood concentration had reached a certain level could he transform into a beast.</p>

  <p>Since Owen was able to mutate into a beast, the concentration of the Cloud Leopard's blood in his body must be very high.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Owen looked like a half-beast human. His nails were sharp, and his round pupils had turned yellow. Two thin lines appeared in the center of his pupils, similar to a leopard's eyes. Sharp tusks shone at the corner of his lips, and his body was covered with pale cyan light.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>Owen roared. His speed had increased manifold now that he was in beast form. With the unique Mu Ning of the legendary beast, he pounced at Marilyn.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>Marilyn probably did not expect Owen's speed to increase significantly.</p>

  <p>Since she couldn't guard against him in time, she failed to dodge his attack.</p>

  <p>His claws collided with Marilyn's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Owen's claws were so sharp that they shredded Marilyn's clothes. Instantly, her upper garments turned to powder, revealing the undergarment that covered her chest. Blood pooled in the claw marks on her shoulder. Her dark blood stood out in sharp contrast to her pale skin.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Owen was about to grab her again, Marilyn twisted her body in a panic. She sighed with relief when she avoided Owen and quickly retreated to the edge of the arena.</p>

  <p>"Shh! Shh!"</p>

  <p>"Show more! Show more!"</p>

  <p>"Her skin is so white. When Owen mauled her, her clothes should have been torn completely!"</p>

  <p>Marilyn's face paled when she heard the disrespectful words of the warriors in the stands.</p>

  <p>She had followed Eddie for decades. For the sake of his Lustful Demon Array, she had kept her virginity energy. How could she bear to be teased by those boorish warriors?</p>

  <p>Marilyn shook her head and focused on the fight with Owen. It seemed that she had underestimated him!</p>

  <p>Owen was only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. If he had entered the Internal Elixir Realm, she would have died from his attack.</p>

  <p>Before Owen transformed into a beast, Marilyn was able to maintain her calm and even had time to deal with Owen. But now, facing Owen who had turned into a beast, Marilyn felt overwhelmed. She joined the tips of her thumb and forefinger. With eyes closed, she raised the other three fingers, and black flowers drifted from her.</p>

  <p>After transforming into a beast, Owen had entered a frenzied state. In his mind, he only had one thought, and that was to kill this woman in front of him.</p>

  <p>He didn't have much time to think and could only pounce quickly, trying to kill his enemy.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of martial artists could no longer keep up with his speed.</p>

  <p>All they could see was a flash of a cyan shadow. In the blink of an eye, it had rushed from one side of the arena to the other!</p>

  <p>Even though Marilyn's movement technique was strange, it was still difficult for her to dodge Owen's attack. As she casually pulled, a pink feather robe was wrapped around her shoulders. This feather robe was inferior to the one Luo Zheng gave to Ning Yudie in terms of its grade, but it was a top-grade fairy weapon and was considered rare and fine amongst fairy weapons. There were very few defensive weapons, so this feather robe was as valuable as an offensive sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the feather robe covered Marilyn, Owen mauled her again.</p>

  <p>However, her thin and light robe's defensive power was astonishing. It blocked Owen's power by at least 80%, so Marilyn didn't suffer any serious damage.</p>

  <p>She was still scattering black flowers.</p>

  <p>Each flower seemed to be placed casually.</p>

  <p>If someone could see Owen's running figure, he would notice that many flowers were already attached to him.</p>

  <p>However, the black flowers caused no pain or itch to Owen's body. He had already gone berserk, and all he wanted was to kill Marilyn, so he didn't care about the flowers.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>Owen roared, and his speed increased. In the blink of an eye, he attacked three more times, gradually forcing Marilyn into a corner.</p>

  <p>Marilyn slowly moved backward, while Owen forced his way forward, step by step, ready to tear her into pieces at any moment.</p>

  <p>Just as Marilyn had nowhere to retreat to, a sneer appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>When Owen readied himself to pounce on her, she opened her mouth and spat out a word, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>"Sssii!"</p>

  <p>Countless fine thorns grew out from Owen's body.</p>

  <p>As the thorns grew, they also penetrated Owen's body, eating his flesh as they wiggled around madly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Owen's body was covered with blood. The black thorns bound his hands and feet. As his entire body had integrated with the thorns, he was unable to move.</p>

  <p>When the thorns had grown to a certain extent, crimson flowers bloomed from the upper branches.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Marilyn walked gracefully to Owen. Reaching out with her hand, she gently plucked a flower and brought it on the tip of her nose to sniff it. She said softly, "Give full consideration before making any decisions. You can't bear the pain of losing your lover, so you can never avenge her!"</p>

  <p>"What are these black thorns? It's disgusting. They eat human flesh!"</p>

  <p>"How tragic! His body must be filled with those black thorns by now!"</p>

  <p>"Yet another divine-level talent is gone. What a pity!"</p>

  <p>Most people present did not recognize the black thorns, but when Elderly Luna of the Mysterious Luna Hall saw them, his face became serious.</p>

  <p>"Those are flesh-eating flowers from hell. They grow on bodies. How did this girl get them?"</p>

  <p>However, just when everyone thought that the fight was over, Owen's immobile body suddenly trembled, and a bug appeared in his hand. The bug was only the size of a thumb, and there were many colors on its back. As soon as it appeared, it spread its wings and flew toward Owen's head.</p>

  <p>When the bug was halfway through its journey, Marilyn thrust the flower in her hand at it. The flower branch pierced right into it, nailing it firmly to the ground.</p>

  <p>Although the bug was small, it was quite fierce. Even though it was nailed to the ground by the flower branch, it still struggled desperately.</p>

  <p>With a smile, she looked at the bug and said, "It's a corpse parasite. Owen, I can tell that you're determined to kill me. After the parasite enters your body, you'll be much more powerful, but you will also turn into a walking corpse, as the parasite will devour your soul. What's worse, you won't be able to walk the path of reincarnation after death. Eventually, your soul will be scattered."</p>

  <p>The corpse parasite was vicious. After being possessed by it, a person would definitely die a miserable death, and even his brain and soul would be devoured. But after being possessed by the parasite, a warrior would become a killing machine, and all the potential in his body would be fully exploited. Evidently, those who used this inhuman method bet all on a single throw.</p>

  <p>The light in Owen's eyes gradually dimmed. He had given up all hope.</p>

  <p>The flesh-eating flowers were unfamiliar to many people, but the corpse parasite was well known.</p>

  <p>"Owen wanted to use the corpse parasite on himself. How determined he is!"</p>

  <p>"He dared to pay such a price for the girl he loves. Alas. What a pity."</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of anyone using the corpse parasite on himself!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this, many martial artists sighed. They felt pity for Owen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clenched his fists as he stared at the arena, unmoving. His gaze was like the rippling waves of water.</p>
