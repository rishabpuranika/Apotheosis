<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>His disbelief didn't arise from the thought that flood dragons could not have burst out a momentum of that degree. Indeed, they were perfectly capable. The momentum that had just broken out in the battle ring was strong and for the disciples of the younger generation, it was certainly extremely frightening. But in eyes of Kenneth, Elder Xu and other elders who were at comparable levels to them, it hardly deserved a mention in powerful forces of the time.</p>

  <p>If a real flood dragon had burst out a roar, it would have been powerful enough to turn an entire hilltop into powdery dust.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the power that Kenneth found formidable. Instead, it was the feeling that roar was giving Kenneth which made him ponder and had him worried.</p>

  <p>There was something about it, as if it had experienced a nirvana and was now standing at the highest level, looking down on all living creatures as if they were nothing at all. This kind of otherworldly feeling could not have been brought onto him by a flood dragon at all.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon was an aquatic creature with power over storms and floods, but was not a legendary beast. It was merely a close relative of one since it had dragon lineage behind it.</p>

  <p>What Kenneth was worried about was the fact that such a powerful effect could only have been achieved by A GENUINE DRAGON!</p>

  <p>He started pondering over things. The idea was a bit far-fetched but the effect he felt was coming from a super legendary beast!</p>

  <p>"It's not from a flood dragon?" Elder Xu asked in astonishment. His eyes were full of an incredible expression. "Are you trying to suggest that it has come from a genuine dragon instead?"</p>

  <p>Kenneth nodded slightly and replied in a solemn tone, "Yes, that's exactly what I'm thinking right now."</p>

  <p>"Impossible?" Elder Xu immediately denied the idea when he heard it, almost out of reflex, completely forgetting that he was talking to his leader at the moment. "A genuine dragon doesn't exist. It is the product of legends, and a figment of our imagination!"</p>

  <p>The world was a big place. There were some people who had practiced hard and made their way to the peak level of martial arts. Then there were those who liked to make up stories and legends about martial artists and legendary creatures.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, a book called "The General Explanation about Legendary Beasts" suddenly found itself on the market and gained quite a bit of popularity. It spread all the way from the Central Region to the Eastern Region, with various pirated versions, and its popularity was such that the number of copies sold on the black market too was unfathomable.</p>

  <p>All the public's common knowledge about legendary beasts and super legendary beasts had been derived from the same book and therefore, was not too trustworthy.</p>

  <p>There were remarks in the book which had suggested that Genuine Dragon, Crimson Rosefinch, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise were the only four super legendary beast races to thrive in this world. There were others too, who belonged to the super legendary beast class; unique, powerful, but unable to thrive or reproduce to increase their numbers.</p>

  <p>For example, the Sky-Devouring Beast, the Nine Colored Phoenix etc.</p>

  <p>It also spoke of creatures less powerful than the super legendary beast, though still quite incredible. These included the Roc, an unfathomably gigantic bird which could transform into a fish, the Blue Phoenix, the Nine-Colored Deer, and so on.</p>

  <p>The book was full of legends about those beasts and had even gone so far as to describe a war between the Genuine Dragon and the Crimson Rosefinch, which had changed mountains and rivers, made stars fall down, and, in one strange moment, even turned the heavens and the earth upside down.</p>

  <p>The contents of the book were pretty fascinating, but many strong people sniffed at them, because the authenticity of those contents it described could not be verified.</p>

  <p>According to them, these unverifiable things were basically legends; stuff of novels could not be taken seriously. And after all, if someone did claim that the dragon was a super legendary beast and it existed, how could it ever be verified? And how could someone be convinced about the ranking of the four super legendary beasts without a shard of proof?</p>

  <p>The flood dragon, on the other hand, could be easily proved as an existent creature, because it did exist and even thrived in the regions that extended across the globe.</p>

  <p>Denied by Elder Xu, Kenneth heaved a long sigh, and then explained: "I fought for the Cloud Hall about ten years ago, and I saw the flood dragon during one of my missions. Although I was only able to catch a short glimpse of it, the powerful momentum emitted by the flood dragon affected me very much. I knew there and then that I would remember it for the rest of my life."</p>

  <p>"Your grace, you have actually seen a flood dragon?" Elder Xu asked in amazement. The flood dragon, with its blood relation to the dragon lineage was still very close to a legendary beast.</p>

  <p>Kenneth nodded and continued in a serious tone, "I can very surely say that the momentum of that flood dragon is basically the same as, or at least similar to the momentum that burst out from Jacques's bone spear.</p>

  <p>It was a very harrowing experience for me back then, and I can't have remembered it wrong."</p>

  <p>After a pause, he went on, "But the dragon roar which just emanated from the ring is completely different from the flood dragon's roar. What's more, the feeling inside it was much more profound and meaningful. I am fairly certain that these two voices belong to two entirely different creatures."</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while based on the facts that Kenneth had provided, Elder Xu was also immersed in the same doubts as Kenneth, 'How exactly could Jacques do that? How could he tap into the momentum of a genuine dragon and exude such strong force? Was it the bone spear made from the spine of the flood dragon in his hand? That was completely impossible!'</p>

  <p>As a general rule, Kenneth could have easily detected the real situation through his superior spiritual sense. But right now, there was a demonic life vitality that had completely spread through the arena and no one could see through it.</p>

  <p>There was something about it that stopped anyone from seeing through it with naked eyes and even spiritual sense as powerful as Kenneth's could not penetrate it at all.</p>

  <p>As a result, all Kenneth could do was wait for the demonic life vitality to disperse gradually.</p>

  <p>The stewards of the area, by contrast, were quite busy at the moment.</p>

  <p>Each of them was roaming around, holding a small bottle in their hands, filled with pills that had the power to nourish souls. As soon as they saw a disciple who was feeling unwell under the impact of the dragon momentum, they gave a pill to him. It was worth noting that the pill wasn't enough for those disciples who had passed out completely. The stewards had to perform emergency medical procedures on site to help them. Therefore, right now, the scene of the All Peaks Competition was very noisy and haphazard.</p>

  <p>Master Wen, also under the impact of the dragon roar, felt unstable and his head was full of a buzzing, humming noise, which was giving him a headache.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, he was not worried about any possible damage to his spirit, but about Luo Zheng's safety, considering the fact that under the impact of the little bit of momentum which had dissipated from the battle ring and crossed into the audience area, even after it was half weakened by Elder Xu's green light curtain, Master Wen's spirit was still damaged.</p>

  <p>Now that Master Wen was hurt, what about Luo Luo Zheng who was standing almost at ground zero?</p>

  <p>Although Master Wen didn't want to figure out the question, his face turned deadly pale when he thought of an answer.</p>
