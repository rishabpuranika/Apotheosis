<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng even found four space rings and one of which had a spacious inner area than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Even though the house provided by the Could Sect was big enough for Zheng, his new possession could not all fit in his place.</p>

  <p>He had to deal with them the next morning and arrange them so he could still have some space for himself.</p>

  <p>On the next few days, aside from further cultivating his strength, he spent most of his time contemplating on the Sun Moon Stars Picture.</p>

  <p>The picture indeed had quite a wonderful effect for cultivators of martial arts.</p>

  <p>The last time he was at the fairy palace, he absorbed a part of the power from the Stars during the first contemplation, and now his demonic life vitality contained part of that Star power.</p>

  <p>When he used the star power, Zheng was overwhelmed by the energy that it released.</p>

  <p>'I have only absorbed a little of that Star power. I wonder what will happen if I absorb all the powers of the Stars, Sun, and Moon. Will my demonic life vitality be more powerful than ever?' Zheng thought ecstatically.</p>

  <p>But contemplating the picture now, Zheng didn't feel that same wonderful feeling he had the first time.</p>

  <p>And he also noticed that he was having a hard time "seeing through" the Sun Moon Stars Picture at that time.</p>

  <p>Aside from contemplating the Sun Moon Stars Picture, Zheng also took the time to consider the means for cultivation.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect was called the holy land for cultivators because it owned plenty of cultivation handbooks, and its most attractive feature was the excellent and conducive cultivation places it had.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng just became an outer disciple of the Cloud Sect, he was not aware of the cultivation places.</p>

  <p>And he had been busy trying to earn points and even argued with Master Su on how he could earn points faster.</p>

  <p>Just two days after Zheng had returned to the Cloud Sect, Aura sent someone over to give him a jade manual since she knew that Zheng wanted to further improve his strength in no time.</p>

  <p>The jade manual had all the information about every cultivation place throughout the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>In the manual, Zheng had read about the Nine Yin Thunder Valley, which was a perfect place where one could use the Nine Yin Divine Thunder to refine the body.</p>

  <p>Another one was about the Freezing Cave. From the name itself, the temperature in place was below the freezing point which was best to strengthen one's will and purify the heart.</p>

  <p>The jade manual also included the Seven Star Sword Light Platform, where swordsmen could master their sword art ten times faster than any regular cultivation place.</p>

  <p>Learning about these special cultivation places made Zheng excited.</p>

  <p>He scanned the pages of the jade manual when he came across the Great Gravity Road. Reading about it, Zheng remembered the road with a strong gravitational pull that they took during the initial exam.</p>

  <p>If he used the Great Gravity Road for his cultivation, it could speed up the refinement of his physical body. Even if he entered the nature level, body refinement was still important. He would definitely go to the Great Gravity Road for his further cultivation, but it wasn't his priority for now.</p>

  <p>So, he continued to read through that jade manual.</p>

  <p>When he turned to the next pages, he noticed the Lake of the Magical Fish. According to the manual, one could hone his attack skills by killing countless phantom murlocs in a life and death situation under strong water pressure.</p>

  <p>It was the perfect place for Zheng and he intended to go there for his training.</p>

  <p>From the flesh refining level to the nature level, Zheng figured that there was no better way to improve his strength and power other than going through life and death situations.</p>

  <p>The fighting experience during those situations was more valuable and important than those gained during daily cultivation.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's excitement was washed off when he read the small annotations at the bottom of the jade manual. He got a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>It turned out that these places for cultivation were not free of charge.</p>

  <p>And the costs were pretty high.</p>

  <p>For example, an hour of cultivation at the Seven Star Sword Light Platform required forty points.</p>

  <p>And the cultivation at the Great Gravity Road cost sixty points per hour.</p>

  <p>As for the Lake of the Magical Fish, one hundred points were needed for an hour of cultivation.</p>

  <p>These were too expensive for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's points were already far more than that of other outer disciples. If Zheng felt his points were not enough for entering these cultivation places, they couldn't afford the costs as well.</p>

  <p>Even most of the inner disciples didn't have enough points to access the secret places.</p>

  <p>But Zheng could not be discouraged just by the costs of these secret places.</p>

  <p>He had received various tasks from Aura that earned him points, so he knew where to get the points from for his training.</p>

  <p>He might find an easy task that could give him a couple of points, but it would surely take a considerable amount of time to earn enough points from easy hands for the cultivation places.</p>

  <p>It was more likely that he would earn more points by completing a hard task. But a hard task would take him ten days to a half month and the points wouldn't be enough for an hour at any of the cultivation places.</p>

  <p>One could buy points by exchanging a lot of cubic crystals in the Cloud Sect, but only the noble clans could do such a thing. Even if the average disciples had enough cubic crystals, they couldn't just exchange them for points.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect was just like a huge company. Every month, the Cloud Sect spent a huge amount of money on the salaries of managers and other officers, as well as the monthly allowances and pills of the hundreds of thousands of the Cloud Sect disciples.</p>

  <p>And in order to maintain the expenses, the Cloud Sect had to charge high fees for the use of some of its places.</p>

  <p>In addition, the maintenance of the training sites also required a lot of crystal energy.</p>
