<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the edge of the deserted land, a strange feeling came over the Wild Gods in the Flying Sickle City when they witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Luo Zheng and David remained still on the ground.</p>

  <p>In the battle between the Wild Gods, they fought each other by turning their bodies into hundreds or even thousands of feet tall.</p>

  <p>Never had they ever seen a soul battle.</p>

  <p>So when they saw Luo Zheng and David standing motionless, they were dumbfounded, with no idea what the two were doing.</p>

  <p>Even Elsa, Jerome, and Lisa watched the scene unfold with curiosity.</p>

  <p>As the disciples of the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race, naturally, they were more experienced and knowledgeable than ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>They had also trained their souls to a certain extent, after all.</p>

  <p>But compared to the True Gods, the Wild Gods required little when it came to their souls, so their souls weren't as powerful. It was the first time they had seen such a soul battle.</p>

  <p>"Just now, I felt David's soul grow very strong in an instant," Elsa said as she stared at David in the distance.</p>

  <p>Romeo nodded lightly. "But it seems that Luo Zheng has repressed him? Luo Zheng won't lose to him in the soul battle."</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng's strong point was his soul.</p>

  <p>And that was the very reason why Romeo led Luo Zheng into the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But everyone seemed to have neglected this point after Luo Zheng's background and impressive skill were revealed.</p>

  <p>At this point, David's head was full of regret.</p>

  <p>To launch a soul attack through the Soul Ring was one of his greatest abilities.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful Luo Zheng was, so long as he couldn't resist David's soul attack, he would be easily defeated or even killed.</p>

  <p>But never did David expect to meet a stronger counterattack from Luo Zheng after launching the soul attack.</p>

  <p>It was made clear that Luo Zheng's soul was much stronger than his own.</p>

  <p>The cracking resounded constantly.</p>

  <p>More and more cracks formed on the Soul Ring? it looked like it could easily break at any time after being shot by the small soul arrows.</p>

  <p>Once the Soul Ring broke, David was sure to die.</p>

  <p>When he was at a loss, he suddenly felt a touch of warmth from the Soul Ring.</p>

  <p>Somehow, the Soul Ring was repairing itself. Once it was stable, it emitted rings of golden light again.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Surprise came over David's expression.</p>

  <p>But then he realized what happened.</p>

  <p>It was Tyler, his master. As it turned out, Tyler was helping him from behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>Tyler once said that the world was too desolate? it was difficult to find suitable materials to refine soul weapons.</p>

  <p>But he promised David to refine a magic weapon that would protect his soul using a wisp of his own.</p>

  <p>Although this piece had been condensed into a Soul Ring, in essence, it was still a part of Tyler's soul, meaning that he could still sense and manipulate it.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Soul Ring's light grow brighter, Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful magic soul weapon. But no? It's a little weird."</p>

  <p>Under his constant attacks, the Soul Ring should've been broken long ago. But somehow, it had returned to its original state.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng could sense how the Soul Ring grew dozens of times stronger.</p>

  <p>No matter how sharp his soul arrows were, hitting it was like an egg smashing against stone.</p>

  <p>It was clear that this was not David's doing. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been suppressed by Luo Zheng's soul power from the beginning.</p>

  <p>In the air above the Flying Sickle City was Tyler, hiding within the void.</p>

  <p>Assessing Luo Zheng's skill, he sighed in resignation.</p>

  <p>"I've taught you all I know. I thought you would have no equal in this world, but incredibly enough, the Nine Li race happened upon such a powerful being. That's all I can do to help you. You need not compete with him on the soul level. You're not necessarily weaker than him. You can still activate your Dubhe Secret to defeat him."</p>

  <p>Tyler had violated a taboo by taking action and helping David.</p>

  <p>If the Nine Li race found out, Tyler would be in great trouble? he'd turn into a laughing stock.</p>

  <p>His disciple was clearly no match for his opponent in the fighting court.</p>

  <p>As a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World, he secretly helped his disciple. It was too embarrassing.</p>

  <p>Since Tyler attached great importance to the Sky South Bone Tower, he couldn't simply let David admit defeat. However, all he could do was use such a trick to help David win.</p>

  <p>Through the warm current coursing around his soul, David could sense Tyler's voice as it slithered into his mind.</p>

  <p>His master's voice got him rather flustered and frightened, but he listened carefully.</p>

  <p>As Tyler's disciple, he ran wild in the Yellow Emperor race? even the elders couldn't do anything to tame him.</p>

  <p>Before Tyler, David behaved well and obediently.</p>

  <p>To whatever his master said, he agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master! I originally wanted to take advantage of trickery to take Luo Zheng down. I'm sorry I was too impatient. If only I had displayed the Dubhe Secret, I wouldn't have fallen into such a state."</p>

  <p>With that, David opened his eyes and shot two golden lights, staring at Luo Zheng from nearby.</p>

  <p>After his soul attacks failed, Luo Zheng also decided to give up.</p>

  <p>Though there was a feeling of doubt in his heart. He couldn't figure out why David's Soul Ring became so powerful in an instant.</p>

  <p>But now was not the time to think about this.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect your soul to be so powerful," David said, looking at Luo Zheng hesitantly.</p>

  <p>He had always been highly proud of himself, and he had every right to be so.</p>

  <p>His master had once said that save for the exiles, he was the most outstanding in terms of both the blood and the talent in this world.</p>

  <p>Even among the people of the Snake Goddess race, no one was better than him.</p>

  <p>And it was true.</p>

  <p>Since he was a child, he had never encountered anyone more powerful than him or anyone he couldn't overcome.</p>

  <p>Jerome and Lisa had been very formidable in the past and yet David only used 40% of his strength to defeat Lisa and barely 60% of his strength to defeat Jerome.</p>

  <p>Such strength was enough to put him above all the talents in the world.</p>

  <p>But this strange fellow appeared out of nowhere and outshone him in terms of both the True God system and soul strength.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for him to accept the fact? the frustration was like a sharp knife piercing his heart.</p>

  <p>Only when he killed Luo Zheng could he ever pull out that knife, he believed.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can defeat me with such power?" David continued.</p>

  <p>Now, the golden light on his body began to change.</p>

  <p>The golden light that evenly covered his body seemed to come alive and begin flowing slowly.</p>

  <p>In most of the Wild Gods' eyes, the Yellow Emperor Wild Body was supposed to condense a layer of golden light comparable to solid metal on the body.</p>

  <p>Most of the members of the Yellow Emperor race could use the Yellow Emperor Wild Body to this extent only.</p>

  <p>But as a member of the Yellow Emperor race, David's blood was included in the Dubhe Chamber, enabling him to activate the Dubhe Secret.</p>

  <p>The exiles had been estranged from their clansmen in this world. Foe example, all these years, Ramzi had never seen his daughter, Adele.</p>

  <p>As a result, very few of them were willing to take the Wild Gods as disciples.</p>

  <p>But because of David's blood, Tyler was willing to accept him.</p>
