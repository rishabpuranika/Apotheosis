<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 179 Bathed In Blood (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At this moment, some of the other demon generals that had been hurt by Zheng's broken flying knife recovered. They stood up one after another and murmured to each other in their language. They were possibly discussing whether to kill this extraordinary human being or not.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng had reached a half step into the nature level. It would be of great significance for their research if the demon generals caught him and took him back to their camp. Perhaps they could learn of Zheng's secrets which had made him this powerful.</p>

  <p>They knew that it was critical for one race to learn of its rival's strengths and weaknesses. In doing so, their race would only become stronger.</p>

  <p>Previously, demons didn't have a culture. But through constant battles with human beings, they had learned something from human cultures and finally, developed their language. Furthermore, they explored human refinement methods step by step and took advantage of everything they acquired from human beings.</p>

  <p>Afterward, both humankind and ogre realized that they should make up for their shortcomings by learning from their rivals' strong points. Hence, they destroyed their moral fences. Now, humankind and ogre had reached pacification through marriage and had learned from each other.</p>

  <p>Drops of blood that flowed from Zheng's wounds stained the bone spurs red.</p>

  <p>For a majority of people, they would have died if attacked by several bone spurs at the same time.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng didn't give up. He got down on one knee, stared at the demon generals in silence, and harnessed demonic life energy near his navel in secret.</p>

  <p>He intended to destroy the bone spurs inside his body with the demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>However great the adversity, Zheng knew that he needed to keep calm.</p>

  <p>Only in this way could Zheng get a chance to win...</p>

  <p>While manipulating the demonic life energy, Zheng reminded himself that he should be calm.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Nina, who had fainted when the demon general grabbed her, opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>Her long eyelashes fluttered as she regained consciousness. As she opened her eyes, she saw that Zheng had been injured and was kneeling.</p>

  <p>Several long bone spurs had penetrated his body and blood was flowing from all his wounds.</p>

  <p>"Zheng... Luo?"</p>

  <p>Nina couldn't help yelling.</p>

  <p>She had known that her life was in danger when the demon general had caught her.</p>

  <p>But she had never expected that Zheng would risk his life to save her.</p>

  <p>Looking at the demon generals around her, it further dawned on Nina that Zheng had also been pushed into a dead end like her.</p>

  <p>'This young man became acquainted with me only a day ago. And yet, he is willing to save me at such a great risk to himself...' thought Nina.</p>

  <p>What Zheng had done moved her a lot.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Nina's call, Zheng responded with a flat smile. In this critical situation, he couldn't be distracted. He needed to focus on producing and harnessing demonic life energy to destroy the bone spurs little by little...</p>

  <p>The demon generals encircling Zheng were still negotiating and discussing with each other in their language.</p>

  <p>Judging from their looks, Zheng concluded that they seemed to have reached a consensus on how to deal with him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a bone spur popped out on a demon general's arm and aimed for Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"It seems that they have decided to kill me," mumbled Zheng. His expression turned sour, and the demonic life energy that was destroying the bone spurs began working quickly when Zheng saw that a bone spur was aimed at him.</p>

  <p>As the demon general was about to shoot the bone spur at Zheng, some muffled noises were heard from his body.</p>

  <p>"Krrrrrrrr..."</p>

  <p>The bone spurs embedded in Zheng's body broke.</p>

  <p>The demon generals paused. This gave the demonic life energy time to break the remaining bone spurs inside Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Immediately, they fell on the ground. Without these bone spurs in his body, Zheng regained his freedom.</p>

  <p>"I won't allow you to live even if it means my death!" yelled Zheng. The second the words left his mouth, the demon general shot his bone spur toward Zheng's head. Zheng tilted his head to one side to dodge the attack. Soon afterward, he stood and approached that demon general.</p>

  <p>During his battle with the demon generals, some of the bone spurs had penetrated Zheng's back. Although the wounds initially dripped blood, the bone spurs acted as stoppers, plugging the wounds and preventing more blood from seeping out. Now that all the bone spurs had fallen off his body and Zheng was moving to dodge the attacks of that demon general, the wounds began bleeding profusely.</p>

  <p>Soon, blood gushed out like water from a spring. In an instant, it appeared as though Zheng had bathed in blood for this battle.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was close enough to the demon general, he aimed a swift punch at the creature.</p>

  <p>"Ogres Shaking the World!" yelled Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Despite his tall and strong figure, that demon general was thrown back several feet by the force of Zheng's fist. Soon, he howled in pain as if tens of thousands of monsters were attacking his body.</p>

  <p>One would be put in a rather miserable situation if demonic life energy poured into his body.</p>

  <p>After Zheng attacked the demon general, the demonic life energy poured into the creature and began dissolving his tissue and flesh.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, wisps of demonic life energy were emitted from the demon general's eyes, mouth, and ears. At last, only a skeleton was left. The demon general's bones clattered to the ground while everyone watched, appalled by what they had seen. The demon general's body had vanished together with the demonic life energy...</p>

  <p>Seeing that their companion had been killed so miserably, the expression on other demon generals changed.</p>

  <p>They were shocked! It was beyond their expectation that a human being at a half step into the nature level could counter-attack under such a critical situation and kill one of their companions in their presence without any fear.</p>

  <p>Except for his head, Zheng was covered in blood. At this moment, his white robe, which was a symbol of an outer disciple at Cloud Sect, had been stained as well. No longer white, it now looked like a bloody robe!</p>

  <p>Despite his severe wounds, unswerving determination was still reflected in Zheng's eyes.</p>
