<br/><br/>

  

  <p>As the curtain of light in the middle of the arena gradually disappeared, the battle between Blake and Edgar started.</p>

  <p>Many factors affected martial artists' combating, such as the mental state, physical condition, cultivation methods and so on.</p>

  <p>Blake and Edgar had stepped within the Internal Elixir Realm and become top disciples in their respective sects, so obviously, they had sharp mental mindsets. The two disciples practiced tier four cultivation methods and were in the primary level of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Today, they'd face off against one another and employ their knowledge of the Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>As the match started, Blake was covered in an Mu Ning of purple lightning, which made him appear as though he were the Thunder God, incarnate. The purple lightning wove around his body like a slender snake and constantly pulsed across his skin. Standing across from Blake, Edgar looked intimidating with a ball of lightning in each hand. The balls oscillated violently and rhythmically, as if each sphere harbored infinite energy.</p>

  <p>"Crackle! Boo-oom!"</p>

  <p>With each foe setting off loud imposing lightning strikes as quick as possible, the field was alive, an electrifying dance of lights flashing through the air. The two clashed continually, and every time they slammed into each other, there were more blinding white flashes, followed by crackling and booming of lightning!</p>

  <p>Sitting on the edge of their seats, the martial artists watching were riveted by how fast the contenders were. Most of the martial artists were stunned and sat with their eyes glued to the arena, while others cheered, and loudly called the name of whichever fighter they preferred.</p>

  <p>Especially eager to watch were the martial artists who specialized in refining using the attributes of thunder. Those spectators watched closely, and it was as though they were committing every step and gesture to memory.</p>

  <p>Cultivating Law Power was an exacting, and challenging path anywhere throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>The stone tablets that the Law Power was carved into were only accessible through sects that were at the fourth and fifth grades.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for warriors to develop the Law Power if they were one of the independent warriors. Anyone from second or third-grade sects who wanted to learn the laws had to be self-taught. However, lacking the comprehension made it impossible for them to gauge how long it should take to understand even a small sliver of Law Power. However, observing Blake and Edgar's battle meant the would-be students could gain some insight into Law Power.</p>

  <p>For that reason, they scrutinized the battle so intently.</p>

  <p>In the grandstands, seating calmly were disciples from the few great sects.</p>

  <p>Nothing was revealed through their indifferent eyes, but inside, the disciples assessed the two combatants, and continuously measured the differences in technique and strength and compared the two people's skills to theirs.</p>

  <p>"Lose!" shouted Blake about halfway through the match.</p>

  <p>Purple lightning that had just been coiled tightly around him resembling a sleek snake suddenly grew more extensive and comprehensive, and resembled a python.</p>

  <p>Seeing the lightning grow, Edgar scowled grimly, and the lightning balls he held shrank until they were fist-sized.</p>

  <p>"Boo-om! Crack!"</p>

  <p>As lightning cracked, it created violent, thunderous crashing while lightning enveloped the entire arena in a stark, white light. Most of the audience unconsciously squinted or squeezed their eyes shut against the blinding flash.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, opened his eyes wider, staring down at the lightning dancing across the arena. He raised his brow slightly, and a trace of confusion clouded his face.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed that within the movements of the flashes of lightning, some of the Thunder Law was unfamiliar to him.</p>

  <p>The sect leaders watching from the grandstands had equally solemn expressions.</p>

  <p>Xander, however, stared down into the arena, stroking his beard contemplatively. A smile slowly spread across his face.</p>

  <p>As for the other several hundred thousand warriors, most of them were hunched, or cringing in their seats, with their eyes shut. Even with the enchanted barrier blocking the full force, they weren't able to bear the luster of the light.</p>

  <p>Eyes shut tight was how an outsider watched the battle, while an insider watched everything, and appreciated what they saw!</p>

  <p>'Odd, the lightning light Edgar uses has a trace of Law Power that I don't understand, ' reflected Luo Zheng curiously.</p>

  <p>"That is Thunder Law's second layer, known as purification," rumbled the cyan dragon in response to Zheng's wandering thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Purification? And that is the second layer into the Thunder Law?" Hidden within the lightning was a small fragment which was barely visible to even Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the first layer is Annihilation, the second layer is known as Purification, and the third is Heavenly Tribulation. When humans attempt to pass into the Realm of Life and Death, the heavenly lightning that drops is termed Heavenly Tribulation!" revealed the cyan dragon, explaining the first three layers of the Thunder Law simply.</p>

  <p>Annihilation, Purification, and Heavenly Tribulation…. The Thunder Law was divided in ten layers, each corresponding to a subcategory law.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng understood nine different Law Powers, he had a lot to learn still!</p>

  <p>"The Ethereal Spirit Sect warrior has comprehended half of the first layer, Annihilation. Perhaps it was a coincidence for him to have gotten a few fragments from the second layer of Thunder Law. Maybe, he is able to understand those fragments. While it is just a small amount, it's more than enough to win," explained the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Nodding in agreement, Luo Zheng watched as the battle ended. In the aftermath, Blake's scorched body was sprawled out on the ground, and the air reeked of his singed flesh. Edgar wobbled slightly but firmly stood on the other side of the arena looking extremely weak, and smiled, happy with his victory.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the second layer of Law Power doesn't exist in the Central Region. To learn the second layer, I have to go to the Upper World, or possibly to the Four Divine Kingdoms," muttered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've already completed the baptism by laws, and there's no need to pursue a higher level in Law Power for a short time. If you combine two or even three types of laws, the results will be extreme…"</p>

  <p>Before the cyan dragon had time to finish, he was cut off by the red dragon, who said, "Ha-ha! Boy, don't listen to my brother! He's talking nonsense.</p>

  <p>The Law Power is the source of the world, but body refiners work outside the laws of nature. If you push yourself to the limit, you will become stronger! After you go through the Eight Path Platforms, I will teach you Transcendent Divine Might! No matter what form of Law Power any rival wields, with Transcendent Divine Might, you will be able to defeat your foes with a single punch!"</p>

  <p>"Brother..." said the cyan dragon, trying to keep the disdain from his voice.</p>

  <p>"Transcendent Divine Might? What's that?" Luo Zheng asked eagerly. His heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>"About that..."</p>

  <p>Frustrated about being cut off, the hot-tempered red dragon stopped short of explaining and seethed. His personality was the opposite of that of the calm cyan dragon, and being interrupted the way he was left the red dragon temporarily stumped.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng wasn't sure what Transcendent Divine Might was, he knew it couldn't be an everyday thing. Luo Zheng considered the nine dragons to be authorities of the world. Whether they were telling Luo Zheng about something they cared about, or it was something they didn't care about, it was always a pearl in Zheng's opinion.</p>

  <p>While the red dragon stewed silently, Luo Zheng beamed and said, "Okay! We have a deal! After I go through the Eight Path Platforms, you will teach me the Transcendent Divine Might!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know what Transcendent Divine Might was, but before asking any questions, he agreed to the red dragon's offer.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon erupted in a hearty chuckle, and said, "Slick move there, brat! My brother's knowledge of Transcendent Divine Might is fundamental. It isn't that he doesn't want to teach you. However, right now, it isn't the right time! "When you attain the Eight Path Platforms, you will be able to develop that as well!"</p>

  <p>"You haven't explained what Transcendent Divine Might is yet," asked Luo Zheng, continuing his internal conversation with the dragons. The cyan dragon's hesitation drove Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>"There is no stronger martial arts skill beyond Transcendent Divine Might, just as the name suggests. If a warrior can master it, he will become the master of the world," stated the cyan dragon slowly.</p>

  <p>What the cyan dragon divulged made Luo Zheng gulp hard.</p>

  <p>To be the master of the world would make someone godlike, and that meant the person was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>"My acupoints are all refined, so, I'll be able to make a breakthrough into the Path Platforms! I'm resolute about studying Transcendent Divine Might!" Luo Zheng mused while his eyes lit up elatedly.</p>

  <p>"I gave my word, and I won't back out. However, let me remind you. It's not as easy as you think to reach the Path Platforms," cautioned the red dragon.</p>

  <p>He paused before going on, "It's especially difficult here in the Central Region. It is actually easier to attain a breakthrough into the Internal Elixir Realm, or Virtual Tribulation Realm, than the Path Platforms!"</p>

  <p>"I understand," answered Luo Zheng eagerly. The happy twinkle in his eyes was slowly replaced with a look of cold, steely resolve.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, pursuing advanced knowledge and honing oneself was a difficult, time consuming challenge. But, then again, slow and steady would win the race, which was proven true from the dawn of time!</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng and the dragons conversed, Blake was carried off the field and back to Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>A collective sigh went out from the warriors sitting in the stands. Blake was very strong, and they didn't think Edgar was stronger!</p>

  <p>Watching the intense fight left many warriors feeling the supreme life vitality crystals they'd spent weren't wasted. The trip here to Oracle City was genuinely worth the cost!</p>

  <p>Once the arena's battlefield was cleaned, Xiao was up on the platform and reached into the container to draw the nameplates.</p>

  <p>After he pulled out two nameplates, Xiao's voice boomed as he shouted,</p>

  <p>"Brody Bu of the Bloodwood Cliff versus  Luo Zheng Luo of Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>When Brody heard his name called, he sniffled, wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, stood, and walked to the grandstand's edge. His scowl changed immediately to a smile, and he stated, "Good, good, I'll finally fight him!"</p>

  <p>Brody had just complained to one of his companions about not having a chance to fight Luo Zheng. It didn't occur to him that his nameplate would be drawn so soon.</p>

  <p>"Luck is on your side, Brody! Really, this means your destiny will be a bright one!" commented one of the warriors flatteringly. The warrior was at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>
