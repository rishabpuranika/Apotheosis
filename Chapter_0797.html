</p>

  <p>How could anyone be as indifferent as Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had made miracles happen, but Ning Yudie thought that those miracles had been reasonable so far. Take for example, his habit of challenging martial artists of higher levels and then triumphing over them. But what she hadn't expected was for him to endure the killing of an immortal!</p>

  <p>Everyone had seen the incomparably powerful talisman exploding and it had been that very talisman that had saved Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>If Yudie's suspicions were right, this talisman was from the Upper World, or it wouldn't have been able to resist the immortal's power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's lazy smile elicited an angry glare from Ning Yudie, who muttered angrily under her breath, "Oh you bastard!"</p>

  <p>She had given up all hope and under the circumstances, she could do no nothing but pray for a miracle. But despite her prayers and much to her disappointment, no miracle seemed to appear on the horizon. Luo Luo Zheng had to rely on his own cards to set the situation right.</p>

  <p>This caused a silence to fall upon everyone present.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom were dark and gloomy, like a pool of water in the night.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected any trouble from these ants of the Sky Northern Region. She had the chance to kill Luo Luo Zheng, but she hadn't been able to do it.</p>

  <p>That was something that she was having a hard time coming to terms with.</p>

  <p>What was more, it looked like Ning Yudie had cursed her.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden lowered her head, so that her hair fell onto her face, blocking her eyes. She said, anger simmering in her voice, "After I get back home, I will bring my forces to destroy your Sky Northern Region!"</p>

  <p>As the beam spun in circles, the martial artists became increasingly nervous.</p>

  <p>The Wheel of Fortune was based entirely on luck without any fixed rules.</p>

  <p>Even someone as strong as Eddie hadn't been able to resist it. But Luo Luo Zheng had managed to resist it and emerged unscathed from his encounter with death.</p>

  <p>Like Ning Yudie, many people had figured out that Luo Luo Zheng had used the method of the Upper World to block the immortal's killing blow.</p>

  <p>But they just couldn't comprehend just exactly how lucky Luo Luo Zheng was. If anyone else had walked into the Dragon Soar Arena, they would have been imprisoned for a thousand years. But Luo Luo Zheng had escaped. He had even brought back a bunch of treasures like the sacred-level protective garment and swords from the Upper World. The talisman that had burst out of Luo Zheng's body was even more powerful.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists were silent, but they simmered with jealousy from within. They had seen people with good luck before, but never one with such strong luck.</p>

  <p>The beam of light came to a stop, pointing in Eddie's direction. Eddie waved his fist, causing the dice to stop at five.</p>

  <p>Eddie took five steps forward and stepped onto the jade green disc. "Light of Long Life. You're awarded 500 years of lifespan."</p>

  <p>"This can't be true! How is Eddie's luck that strong?!"</p>

  <p>"His luck has always been good. Otherwise, how could he, an independent warrior, resist the Ethereal Spirit Sect and become the strongest man in the Central Region?"</p>

  <p>All the other martial artists were envious, and it showed in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Just like the cyan dragon had said, the first half of Eddie's life was filled with adversity. Suppressed by the Ethereal Spirit Sect, he had had a bitter feud with the sect for quite a while. But with luck by his side, he had made great progress.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up as Eddie was enveloped in a green light. With his good luck, it wouldn't be difficult to find another girl with a Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>The realization that he didn't have much time left brought a sense of urgency to his heart.</p>

  <p>Most people in the abyss were moving at a moderate pace towards the center. A majority of them had walked between ten and thirty steps. Luo Luo Zheng was at the front, closely followed by Ning Yudie and the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>After a full lap, it was Luo Zheng's turn to throw the dice again.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to march forward, and with great success at that," Luo Luo Zheng said with a confident smile. He rolled the dice and it kept rolling until it finally stopped at six. A yellow light then appeared on the last disc. "Roll the dice again!"</p>

  <p>The other martial artists began to animatedly discuss this.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is so lucky! None of us can beat him when it comes to luck!"</p>

  <p>"I've already thrown the dice five times but have never gotten a six. Look at him! He has even gotten an extra chance to throw the dice!"</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing that you didn't face any punishment. Just think about those who were killed!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stepped on the yellow disc. As he once again swung his fist, the dice began to roll. "It's a six again!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sighed as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng, who was now walking forward. When she had run into him at the Cloud Road test, she had been surprised that he had actually practiced the cultivation method of the ogre. At the time, for her, Luo Zheng's only value that had been of use was breaking the enchanted barrier in the flood dragon's belly.</p>

  <p>But after that, this young man had displayed his talent with an astonishing speed and consistency. With his talent, he could truly go a step further than Ning Yudie on the path of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sighed again. 'Unfortunately, his time is too short. He's anxious to save his sister. But given thirty years' time, he could, without a doubt, easily step into the Life and Death Realm.'</p>

  <p>But what Ning Yudie didn't know was that Luo Zheng's target was not just the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>The path of martial arts was long and without end. Luo Zheng's ultimate goal was to reach the peak of martial arts and explore the most fundamental mysteries of this world.</p>

  <p>"It's a six again."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already taken ninety-four steps. He was already in the center of the abyss, from where he could see the big dice if he looked up.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were focused on Luo Luo Zheng. He had gotten an extra chance to throw the dice again and that had left the audience speechless. His luck was far beyond anyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng threw the dice again and after a roll, it stopped at six yet again.</p>

  <p>"Do I pass?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the last disc, which was flashing azure, as if it was the reflection of the blue sky.</p>

  <p>Before stepping on it, Luo Luo Zheng turned to look at Ning Yudie, gave her a faint smile, and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A blue ray of light shot out from the disc and enveloped Luo Luo Zheng. Soon, his figure disappeared.</p>

  <p>Every warrior apart from Ning Yudie and the members of the Cloud Hall were staring at where Luo Luo Zheng had been standing, looks of pure envy in their eyes.</p>

  <p>They hadn't known what the first person to pass the Wheel of Fortune would be rewarded with, but they had seen the generous rewards that it had given them so far. Going by that rate, it was obvious that the first person to pass the wheel would be rewarded handsomely.</p>

  <p>The warriors had waited dozens, even hundreds, of years, and had paid great prices just to light all the enchanted lamps from the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>There were many Life and Death Realm warriors and leaders of various sects among them. But in the end, they had been trumped by a junior at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Don't be discouraged. Getting first place doesn't mean he can obtain the immortal's legacy," someone said unconvincingly.</p>

  <p>"That is true, but the first winner will definitely benefit a lot."</p>

  <p>Most people were jealous when Luo Luo Zheng left. Few had even coldly mocked him.</p>

  <p>Yudie's smile didn't fade for a long time, her eyes shining like two crescent moons. Her amused joy wasn't because Luo Luo Zheng had come first, but because he had smiled at her just before he took the final step.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had been enveloped by the azure light, his entire body seemed to disintegrate into tiny bits that kept rising.</p>

  <p>This method of transportation was very similar to the one used on the fifth floor of the Dragon Soar Arena. Was this also a kind of long-distance transportation? Would he be transported to the Upper World?</p>

  <p>But as he looked around him, Luo Luo Zheng soon understood that it was only a kind of short-distance teleportation. He hadn't felt the passage of time then, but he was sure it hadn't been this short the last time he had been transported from the Dragon Soar Arena to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng found himself standing in a dark palace. Waves of cold wind blew over him, and he saw a huge coffin standing in front of him.</p>

  <p>"This is the immortal's coffin? It's so big!" Luo Luo Zheng muttered curiously. The scene reminded him of the Immortal Mansion where everything was incomparably huge.</p>
