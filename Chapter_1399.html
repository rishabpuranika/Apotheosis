<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The crowd's voice from the outside did not reach the confines of the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Layla had intended to watch the fight between her brother and Luo Luo Zheng, but she was occupied at present with her opponent.</p>

  <p>"Focus on our battle, little girl. Ha-ha!" he taunted. His derisive laugh was accompanied by a strange, ghost-like Mu Ning that emerged from his body. It turned into fist-sized skulls and shot straight toward Layla.</p>

  <p>At present, Layla's brother was fighting for his freedom. The thought weighed heavily on her even as she fought her own battle.</p>

  <p>She made no response to the warrior in front of her, her figure dancing gracefully in the air as her long hair swirled with her movements. Her eyes remained fixed on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng attacked with his sword, and Lincoln let out an almost manic laugh.</p>

  <p>Golden light flashed from his body as he blocked the wind blade with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The next moment, the blade scattered into pieces. The lightning that struck Lincoln's body did not affect him in the slightest. Luo Luo Zheng then used the Nether God Shadow, but once again, it was smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>Having solved Luo Zheng's another move, Lincoln took large strides and dashed straight towards him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm even as Lincoln stopped his attacks one after another.</p>

  <p>The battle was his sole focus? he thought of nothing else but the present fight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, ten Nether God Shadows shot out from Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the surging Nether God Shadows, Lincoln roared. The golden light around his body became even more resplendent. The light clothed him like a second skin, giving him the appearance of a golden figure. The luminous glow was almost blinding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Nether God Shadows were strong and fierce, but stood no chance against Lincoln. As soon as they approached him, they splintered to a thousand pieces.</p>

  <p>"Lincoln has a profound comprehension of the Metal Law. This is probably going to be troublesome, even for Luo Luo Zheng," a palace leader remarked.</p>

  <p>At this, another palace leader shook his head. "That may not be so. Luo Luo Zheng was able to cross the flame pool. He must have uncovered secrets unknown to anyone else. He had only used Thunder Wind Divine Sword in the first twenty-four rounds of the trial. We still do not know what sort of trump card he might be hiding."</p>

  <p>Compared to the other warriors, the palace leaders' appraisement was naturally much more accurate.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors from the thirteen palaces, they had kept on flattering Lincoln, cheering at his every movement.</p>

  <p>After destroying Luo Zheng's Nether God Shadows, Lincoln took a step forward, quickly closing the distance between him and Luo Luo Zheng. A streak of Time Law simultaneously erupted from Lincoln's body. In an instant, the entire platform began to slow down.</p>

  <p>The next instant, Luo Luo Zheng undid the restraints of Lincoln's Time Law.</p>

  <p>The Time Law and Space Law were opposites, but they did not affect each other. Lincoln's action was only a probing move. To warriors of this level, knowledge of the Time Law was nothing unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Nether God Shadows!"</p>

  <p>After the Time Law was undone, Luo Zheng's figure once again retreated. One after another, Nether God Shadows continued their onslaught of attacks on Lincoln. Each of the shadows displayed a different technique as they surrounded Lincoln from different directions.</p>

  <p>Any other warrior would have been dwarfed by the relentless attacks.</p>

  <p>Lincoln, however, was no ordinary fighter. "Useless," he said with a confident smile. This time, he did not even bother to defend himself. He charged forward, his body like a raging bull, and shattered the Nether God Shadows that were in his way.</p>

  <p>He moved with a power that could destroy even a mountain range. "I know that you have more strength than this. Why don't we quit playing around and be more serious?" he said aloud provokingly.</p>

  <p>As Lincoln got closer to him, Luo Luo Zheng moved back the platform like a gust of wind, releasing one Nether God Shadow after another.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was using the same trick, Lincoln shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've already told you. This is all useless." He kept on shattering the shadows that Luo Luo Zheng released, and then said again, "Since you insist on relying on the sword in your hand so much, then I'll just have to remove it."</p>

  <p>Lincoln intertwined his hands together. Then, a golden ring appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The moment it appeared, Luo Luo Zheng felt his Thunder Wind Divine Sword being absorbed by a strong force, as if it wanted to fly out of his hand. He gripped his sword even tighter, trying to fight off the strange magnetic force.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was proud of his strength. But when he felt the golden ring trying to wrench his weapon out of his grasp, his heart raced.</p>

  <p>A trace of surprise flickered over Lincoln's features when he saw that Luo Zheng's sword remained in his hands. With another shout from him, the golden ring expanded to three times its original size, increasing its force threefold.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had remained expressionless despite the increased strength of the golden ring. No one would be his equal in terms of pure strength.</p>

  <p>The power of the dragon scales poured into his body, and his grip on the long sword became even more stable. It barely shook despite the powerful sucking force from the golden ring.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment dawned on Lincoln's face as he watched his opponent.</p>

  <p>The Metal Law was his strongest suit, and no one had ever escaped the Everlasting Golden Ring cast by him. He had disarmed his opponent every time. However, Luo Zheng's sword remained in his grasp as he dodged. It was the first time someone had ever been able to withstand this technique. 'What incredible strength!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>'Is this strength his trump card?'</p>

  <p>Lincoln moved on from his surprise quickly enough. Once again, his hands intersected and the golden ring expanded once more. A profound understanding of the Metal Law allowed one great power.</p>

  <p>Each of the Original Laws had the power to destroy the heavens and the earth with enough skill and mastery. Thus, there existed a proverb in the Upper World, "There is no strongest law, only the strongest warrior."</p>

  <p>The laws contained boundless power, but similar to any weapon, they were only as strong as the hands that wielded them.</p>

  <p>A small smile appeared on Luo Zheng's lips as the sensation of an unknown gravity flowed through him. The strength of the dragon scales was swiftly pouring out. There was no way he would allow his own sword to be snatched away from his own grasp.</p>

  <p>As the fight went on, it became even more apparent that the two men were evenly matched. Lincoln grabbed the golden ring in his hand and gently spun it. Streams of golden light shot towards Luo Luo Zheng, but he kept a firm grip on his sword. The two parties had come to a deadlock.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Layla had already activated her movement technique to the maximum as well. She dodged her opponent's attacks while simultaneously watching her brother's battle.</p>

  <p>"I thought I already told you to be more serious, little girl. You'll lose if you're distracted," her opponent jeered.</p>

  <p>Layla wore a cold expression. She no longer had the heart to fight. So what if she won? All that mattered to her was her brother's victory.</p>

  <p>Things were different for her opponent, however. This battle held great merit to him. Victory would mean his freedom. Seeing Layla's dispirited face, he took advantage of the moment to press her closer.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continuously dodged the golden beams of light while keeping his strength to a certain level in order to prevent his Thunder Wind Divine Sword from being wrenched from his hand. At the moment, he was in a somewhat passive position.</p>

  <p>The Nether God Shadows dealt no damage to Lincoln. Lincoln's metal-attribute cultivation technique was overwhelming, but it was not that Luo Luo Zheng did not have any way for a counterattack. He could use the Nether God Shadows to send Xun to Lincoln's side. With her current strength and the Cold Plum Blood Spear, she would only need one spear strike to kill Lincoln.</p>

  <p>However, Xun's identity was a very sensitive matter. Other than Yolande, Luo Luo Zheng didn't trust anyone else in here. Moreover, in a fight like this, he did not want to rely on Xun's help.</p>

  <p>As he considered all this, Luo Luo Zheng put the Thunder Wind Divine Sword back into his space ring. Then, his figure flashed as he charged towards Lincoln.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, Lincoln had been trying to force Luo Luo Zheng to engage in close combat with him. As he saw him move forward, a faint smile appeared on his face. He was most confident of his own body.</p>

  <p>He had trained the Metal Spirit Body with the help of the Metal Law? his body was as tenacious as a divine weapon. No one would match him in close combat.</p>

  <p>"Finally!" he shouted. "You decided to not waste my time." Lincoln smiled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression remained calm. He did not speak, but he felt his body hum with the power that had been long stored away since the start of the battle.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Lincoln faced him head on, returning the punch with just his raw power.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the strength of their physical bodies would be the decisive factor in the outcome.</p>

  <p>A loud noise echoed around the two men, followed by a drastic change in Lincoln's expression.</p>
