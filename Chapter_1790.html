<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The instant the green incantations appeared, dozens of sinister looking ghost faces appeared. They projected a greenish hue and looked terrifying as they drifted towards the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier that was named Light of Water was enough to block the Space Law to a certain extent. But the ghost faces could easily cross over it.</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race was not so good at open battle. Even though this supreme sorcerer's cultivation was weak as compared to a Supreme Lord, he could still use powerful spells.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer floated in midair, looking around with his two peculiar eyes revealing only the whites.</p>

  <p>For the time being, he was focusing on controlling the ghost faces as they silently drifted back and forth in the Could Hall.</p>

  <p>At the same time the supreme sorcerer was also aware about his surroundings. He was keeping an alert eye on the activities happening below him.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to see that the Celestial Position race allowed these kids to come here without any defenses around them. With this careless action, he easily had an advantage over them!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Little kids, I found you!" The supreme sorcerer mocked at the Godly Geniuses by pointing at their direction. Immediately the ghost faces turned towards that direction at the same time.</p>

  <p>The ghost faces were constantly shuttling and they illuminated like giant fireflies in the dark night.</p>

  <p>What a sight!</p>

  <p>These ghastly faces did not have a fixed shape. The moment they entered, they rushed towards Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first to react. As soon as he saw the ghost faces, he went on instant alert. Quickly he grabbed Ning Yudie by her waist and pulled her away.</p>

  <p>He could not figure out the strength of these ghost faces. Sensing their evil Mu Ning emanating from them, he instantly went on guard.</p>

  <p>One of the ghost faces accidentally brushed against a warrior of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. That fraction of contact was enough to freeze the warrior's body. He opened his mouth to scream but no sound came out. And just like that his body went limp with the look of fear etched across his face.</p>

  <p>Seeing this horror, the entire hall went in an uproar. There was panic everywhere with people running around without any sense of direction.</p>

  <p>"What just happened?"</p>

  <p>"Quick, retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Such a cruel way to exercise power! We are doomed!"</p>

  <p>Soon all the warriors started dropping dead like flies.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, many warriors were slain mercilessly. There was such panic among the people right now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others looked with dismay at the scene unfolding before their eyes. They definitely wouldn't be able to withstand such strange and fast attacks from the enemies, let alone fight against them.</p>

  <p>'We are no match for this force!' 'They can take our lives without showing up.'</p>

  <p>'Retreat back to the fairy palace!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately thought.</p>

  <p>With Ning Yudie by his side, they both could be safe. But what about Geoffrey? He was still in the Cloud Hall with Imogen.</p>

  <p>In his moment of hesitation, one of the ghost faces had already pounced on Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The situation was similar for Kurt, Lucille, Nathan and others. The Godly Geniuses were already surrounded by their enemies.</p>

  <p>"You go in first!" At this moment, Luo Zheng already had the token of mountain in his hand. However his priority was to ensure that Ning Yudie and Mu Ning got safely into the palace. As for Freya, Luo Zheng could not reach out to her as she was positioned far away.</p>

  <p>However, if this was the case, then Tianming and others might be in danger, too.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was clueless as to how to deal with this crisis. He knew that his return back to the Lower World would not be that easy, but he did not anticipate such methods from the sorcerer race. He had no idea on how to fight it back.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, everyone froze in their actions.</p>

  <p>The wine cups and saucers that had been placed on the square tables froze in mid-air. The droplets from the cups also remained suspended in a similar way. The flickering light from the candles ceased its movement.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, time had stopped for everyone.</p>

  <p>One could see a middle-aged warrior wearing long gray robe, sitting in the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had earlier been acquainted with this warrior. He was present when he had his blood exchanged and was a Supreme Lord of Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>As he flicked his hand, a series of lightening thunderbolts shot out from his fingertips.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang!</p>

  <p>The power that shot out from his fingertips did not seem very powerful, especially to a Supreme Lord who possessed the power to destroy the world.</p>

  <p>But for the moment it was more than enough, for one by one the ghost faces started dropping dead!</p>

  <p>After all the ghost faces were slain, the time that had stood still seemed to flow back in action.</p>

  <p>Up until now, nobody really knew about the Supreme Lord's control over the Time Law. The scene played before their eyes in a slow motion, including their thoughts.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the crowd couldn't see the Supreme Lord's attack. All they could see was a blurred vision of all the whole action.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord turned his head and smiled at Luo Zheng and the others,</p>

  <p>"Come out you little brats! It is time to go back."</p>

  <p>"We are eternally grateful, Supreme Lord Mirage, for saving our lives,"</p>

  <p>Tianming said folding his hands with respect.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also followed suit and folded his hands in gratitude. He still could not shake off the feeling that they were so close to death! There were so many people in Cloud Hall who were relying on him and he nearly failed them! He realized that the Celestial Position was still not very confident about their group and had arranged for a Supreme Lord to protect them.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who dared to attack us?" Nathan's expression had turned sour.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had been implicated by Luo Zheng and he was very furious with that. He should have listened to his instincts and not followed him then.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage just waved his hand and said indifferently, "That's just a certain supreme sorcerer who will be in trouble now."</p>
