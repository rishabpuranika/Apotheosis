<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was quite obvious that the Monkey Spirit King was very much obsessed with the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The thirteen wolf teeth did appear at the edge of the dream and were, in fact, very real.</p>

  <p>However, the sight of the teeth seemed to have triggered something in his memory.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's eyes suddenly flashed!</p>

  <p>When the necklace broke, the thirteen wolf teeth that made it up also got damaged.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King wanted not just the teeth but also the bloodline theurgies they contained.</p>

  <p>These thirteen bloodlines once formed the foundation of his strength and were even stronger than the four origin-level bloodlines, especially when combined with his trillions of years of experience.</p>

  <p>When the wolf teeth broke, their bloodline power also disappeared, so they were unable to enter his dream.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Monkey Spirit King felt both joy and regret.</p>

  <p>The loss of bloodline power in those wolf teeth had saved his life but he still felt immensely disappointed.</p>

  <p>To wake up, he needed the thirteen wolf teeth that were rich in bloodline power, which was highly unlikely to appear. There did not seem to be that much hope for him.</p>

  <p>Back in the hall, the Eye Spirit and Sewell continued to observe the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>They'd been waiting for an hour but the Monkey Spirit King had still yet to make any movements.</p>

  <p>Sewell's anxiousness seeped into the air and the Eye Spirit easily sensed it but he did not say anything.</p>

  <p>After a while, Sewell's patience ran out.</p>

  <p>"Something's wrong."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's self-consciousness should have been removed by the Three Resentments Poison.</p>

  <p>It shouldn't take such a long time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Unable to take it anymore, Sewell decided to crawl onto the Monkey Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>As he approached the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, he laid his long tail onto the three-colored rope.</p>

  <p>Through it, he was able to see something.</p>

  <p>It was quite blurry but to Sewell, the scene was clear enough to make him pale with fright.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth couldn't enter the Monkey Spirit King's dream.</p>

  <p>What in the world should they do now?!</p>

  <p>Preparations for this day were incredibly extensive and meticulous. The Snake Masters planned it all to the dot. Nobody ever expected something like this to occur!</p>

  <p>Not even Sewell, resourceful as he might be, knew what to do.</p>

  <p>Knock! Knock!</p>

  <p>Just then, a knock on the door interrupted their thoughts. It was Manuel.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he couldn't help himself and had to take a look at what was happening.</p>

  <p>Sewell's eyes glimmered and he called out to the Eye Spirit below, "Come up here!"</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had no idea what Sewell was up to but he still flew straight up just as he told him to.</p>

  <p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>

  <p>Manuel continued to knock but to no avail.</p>

  <p>With no answer, he and the Monkey Masters decided to just burst in with a bang!</p>

  <p>The sight of Sewell on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder made Manuel incredibly angry. He quickly shot Sewell a ferocious glare. "What are you doing, Sewell?!"</p>

  <p>Sewell smirked. "I was planning on just leaving quietly but since you burst in so rudely..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With Sewell in control of his body, the Monkey Spirit King took a step forward and swung his fist towards Manuel!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Monkey Spirit King was a bit clumsy due to the Three Resentments Poison.</p>

  <p>Manuel, as the Great Ape King, was only second to the Monkey Spirit King, so a clumsy punch wasn't going to be enough to knock him down.</p>

  <p>His reaction was fast and he was able to dodge the Monkey Spirit King's attack.</p>

  <p>The same could not be said for the other Monkey Masters behind him who had to suffer the blow because they did not move fast enough.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With that strike, the entirety of the Ghost Mountain shook violently.</p>

  <p>The punch had sent the Monkey Masters straight onto the wall!</p>

  <p>What was once solid brick was now a smashed hole.</p>

  <p>Had they been ordinary creatures then that clumsy punch would've been enough to kill them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they were Treacherous Beings who could only die through the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard the Monkey Spirit King punched them, it would do nothing.</p>

  <p>Manuel, in an effort to avoid the Monkey Spirit King's strike, did a somersault and climbed up along his arm.</p>

  <p>He did not need to fight the Monkey Spirit King head-on. All he had to do was get rid of Sewell.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit turned to Sewell as Manuel made his way to them. "Do you want me to stop him?"</p>

  <p>"No. You won't be able to anyway," Sewell told him.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Eye Spirit was no match for Manuel.</p>

  <p>As soon as Sewell finished speaking, he suddenly hissed.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit did not see him move but it seemed that Sewell had already launched his attack.</p>

  <p>Manuel, who had been climbing the Monkey Spirit King's arm suddenly began to move and maneuver around acrobatically, as if trying to avoid numerous deadly weapons heading his way.</p>

  <p>In a way, the Shadowless Poisonous Lines were indeed deadly weapons of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>These things were incredibly difficult to detect because they were almost invisible.</p>

  <p>They could not kill Treacherous Beings but they helped to greatly reduce their speed.</p>

  <p>In a battle of this level, the slightest loss of speed could spell defeat.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Manuel, he was no ordinary Monkey Master and had extremely strong sensibility.</p>

  <p>He was able to weave through the Shadowless Poisonous Lines. Manuel was light on his feet and was able to quickly reach the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>His opponent's arrival seemed to have made Sewell a bit anxious.</p>

  <p>To deter Manuel's approach, Sewell decided to set forth more Shadowless Poisonous Lines to his opponent.</p>

  <p>It seemed to have worked since the look in Manuel's eyes grew even more cautious.</p>

  <p>"Upper left!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>True enough, there was a hole on the upper left that he suddenly jumped into.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as he came out of the hole, however, the Monkey Spirit King's huge palm slapped down on his head.</p>

  <p>Manuel was directly smashed onto the second floor of the Ghost Mountain as a result.</p>

  <p>A trace of ridicule appeared in Sewell's eyes as he looked at the crater Manuel created. "As a Treacherous Being now, you're still as stupid as before."</p>

  <p>Wasting no time at all, Sewell manipulated the Monkey Spirit King's body to stretch out his hands into the wall and fiercely pull it apart!</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>With the Monkey Spirit King's continued assault, cracks soon appeared on the surface of the Ghost Mountain's center line.</p>

  <p>It seemed he was determined to tear the entire Ghost Mountain apart!</p>

  <p>Right now, it would be appropriate to say that everything was a mess.</p>

  <p>Members of the Red Demon race, Grand Mighty race, and Glede Demon race continued to wait patiently on the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, light began to permeate the west wall.</p>

  <p>To their shock, the indestructible Ghost Mountain crumbled right before their very eyes!</p>

  <p>Decker had stayed in a separate room.</p>

  <p>Bainbridge had brought him there to meet the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>It was a fairly big deal to have fused with the Ghost Master's pet so he definitely had to meet them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the matter regarding the Eye Spirit and the wolf teeth took all of the Monkey Masters' attention so they did not bother to respond to Bainbridge's request at all.</p>

  <p>Thus, Bainbridge had no choice but to lock Decker in that room until such time that the Monkey Masters would be able to meet him.</p>

  <p>Despite his situation, Decker were not desperate.</p>

  <p>He held his glazed sheet carefully and took a look at Cary.</p>

  <p>Cary was a hatred-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Just having him by Decker's side, even for a moment, was worth it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, the side of the room suddenly collapsed. The Ghost Mountain had split into two!</p>

  <p>As Decker held on and planted himself flat on the other wall, he saw a huge monkey leap out of the mountain.</p>

  <p>This monkey took a step on the Ghost Mountain before launching himself onto the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Decker was, in a word, confused. Extremely confused.</p>

  <p>He felt a strong, treacherous aura from the huge monkey so he was surely a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>But could such a powerful Treacherous Being truly exist?</p>
