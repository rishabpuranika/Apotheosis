<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1931 He Was Asleep For A Long Time </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Celestial Position was in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was on a roll. There was no stopping them from conquering many supreme worlds. But Wynn and Master Feng had planned to sacrifice some worlds to buy time.</p>

  <p>Although the Sacred race had a huge appetite, the Evolutionary Universe was vast that they wouldn't be able to swallow it all at once.</p>

  <p>So, to afford themselves some time, there was no other option but to sacrifice the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred race began invading the Evolutionary Universe, the three great forces of human race united. Even Supreme Lord of Oracle and Supreme Lord of Original Sin had put aside their grudges in the hope of defeating their biggest adversary. But the Sacred race continued to devour their territories. It seemed that their joint force could not do anything to stop the conqueror.</p>

  <p>Once the Sacred race destroyed the Humanity Alliance, the Evolutionary Universe would be in trouble. In this situation, differences and feuds must be set aside. Their chance of survival would rely on their willingness to work together.</p>

  <p>But despite being the only viable option, it was a difficult decision to make.</p>

  <p>"Sir," Master Feng said when he entered the secret place while cupping his hands as a sign of respect to the old man, Wynn.</p>

  <p>Wynn was floating in the air with his legs crossed when Master Feng came in. The old man was surrounded by a continuous stream of bright starlight like an endless meteor shower.</p>

  <p>He sensed Master Feng's presence but did not respond to the latter's call.</p>

  <p>His eyes were kept closed as if he was in the middle of meditation on the starlight.</p>

  <p>Master Feng realized that Wynn didn't want to be disturbed, so he quietly stepped back to not interrupt the old man's thought.</p>

  <p>Not long after, more starlight appeared and surrounded Wynn. They began to form complicated patterns like the constellations in the sky.</p>

  <p>The number of patterns rapidly increased and started to ascend into the sky. When they reached the top of the secret place, they converged and formed a white band of light. It circled in the sky then began to slowly descend towards Wynn's head.</p>

  <p>The band of light began to spread out and all the stars in the universe emitted light simultaneously.</p>

  <p>It was nighttime in the universe when all the stars shone brightly, lighting up the universe like it was daytime.</p>

  <p>Master Feng could notice the changes in the universe even when he was standing in the secret place. It appeared that Wynn was using a secret technique.</p>

  <p>Wynn was the only True God in the Celestial Position and he was also the person that had activated the bloodline of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Being the disciple of a Holy Being, Wynn had extensive sacred wisdom about the universe and its events.</p>

  <p>As the band of light came closer to Wynn's head, it expanded more slowly. It looked like it had almost reached its stretch limit.</p>

  <p>Wynn had not moved since Master Feng found him meditating here. But as the band of light came closer to him, his brows slightly furrowed.</p>

  <p>When he extended both his hands, a ray of light emitted from his cinnabar field and a light blue crystal shot out from it. It began to circle in front of Wynn.</p>

  <p>It was an octagon-shaped crystal. At first glance, Master Feng thought it was an eight-diagram talisman, and he felt an eternal aura vibrating from the octagon-shaped crystal.</p>

  <p>'That is Wynn's Godly Tile! It has left his body!' Master Feng thought as his eyes were wide open in astonishment. He had heard about the Godly Tile, but he never imagined he would see one with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, even after the Godly Plate appeared, the starlight emitting from Wynn's body did not diminish. Instead, it even grew brighter. The speed at which the band of light above his head spread out became more rapid.</p>

  <p>"Condense!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>The specks of starlight simultaneously darted towards Wynn's head and converged with the band of light. It appeared that the old man intended to pull the band of light into his mind.</p>

  <p>When the band of light was only about two inches away from his head, a cracking sound resonated from it.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>The band of light was suddenly disassembled back into complicated patterns on top of Wynn's head. And soon after, the patterns made of starlight completely vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>Wynn's face immediately darkened.</p>

  <p>"What the-, why…" From the look on Wynn's eyes, one could deduce that this True God felt disappointed.</p>

  <p>It could only mean that what he was doing was very essential. But what exactly happened that made this True God feel dejected?</p>

  <p>"Sir, you..." Master Feng was quick to ask when he saw Wynn's eyes opened.</p>

  <p>Wynn glanced at Master Feng and sighed, "I was using the Grand Star Technique just to fully utilize the power of all the stars."</p>

  <p>The Grand Star Technique was a special technique which belonged to the Star Godly Way of the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Utilize the power of the stars? What are you planning to do with it?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng was a bit confused at what Wynn was trying to say.</p>

  <p>Wynn continued, "I want to take over the entire Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>If I can control the entire universe, then I can use the one hundred thousand supreme worlds as substitutes and my strength can be enhanced. If I succeed, then even the True God of the Sacred race won't be able to defeat me."</p>

  <p>"Take control of the universe and usurp the heavens?" Master Feng looked shocked.</p>

  <p>Wynn nodded his head and a strange expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"My master's body is already halfway into decay. Without any consciousness, he shouldn't be able to control the entire universe right now. If that's the case, then I'll take over the entire universe. But just now, I felt a strange power preventing me from doing it. I don't understand why…"</p>

  <p>This was not Wynn's first attempt at taking over the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's eyes widened in disbelief. He cleared his throat then said,</p>

  <p>"Previously there was a time when the sorcerer race had secretly laid out an array at the backside of a great world to usurp the heavens but failed!</p>

  <p>Perhaps there is indeed a power that is blocking anyone from doing so!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng was pertaining to the time when they fought with the sorcerer race and the Torch Dragon. The sorcerer race had activated that array to fuse with the will of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race seemed to be doing fine until the last step when they were repelled by a mysterious force.</p>

  <p>At that time, they suspected that there was a traitor among the sorcerer race, but as the remaining warriors of the sorcerer race were cleared, still nothing happened to the heavens. So the previous guess proved to be wrong. Until today, no one still knew what exactly happened.</p>

  <p>Now, even with Wynn's Grand Star Technique, he still had failed to assimilate into the heavens.</p>

  <p>He was also repelled by a kind of power. It felt as if the heavens had already been in someone's control and anyone else had been blocked out.</p>

  <p>What Master Feng didn't know was it was Zheng who had fused with the heavens.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already fused with the will of the great worlds and the will continued to move along the ascending passageways towards the supreme worlds. And even though Zheng already left the Evolutionary Universe for the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, it would still be impossible for anyone, even for Wynn, to get in or take control of the heavens.</p>

  <p>After his failed attempt, Wynn had a look of regret on his face.</p>

  <p>He was so close to successfully fusing with the heavens and taking control of the entire Evolutionary Universe. If that happened, he could have secured a place in the Evolutionary Universe and even if the Sacred race sent out several True Gods to fight at the same time, they would still be unable to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>"So, what are you doing here?" Wynn stared at Master Feng and asked.</p>

  <p>Master Feng began to report to Wynn the responses from the several Supreme Lords of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>After hearing the report, Wynn couldn't help but shake his head in dismay. "This is ridiculous! They don't have enough men to fight. They only have a few Supreme Lords. Even if they summon all the world lords, they don't stand a chance. They are digging their own graves!"</p>

  <p>"But to ask them to sit back and watch as the Sacred race invade their territories, that is quite cruel," Master Feng shook his head and said.</p>

  <p>Master Feng could understand the reactions of the Supreme Lord of Oracle and the other Supreme Lords. He could not stand watching the Sacred race slowly destroying the Human Alliance's territories.</p>

  <p>Wynn could not argue with that anymore as he knew what Master Feng was trying to convey. He sighed and said, "Fine. If they want to fight, we might as well join them. This time, I will use the power of the stars to help them win."</p>

  <p>"We'll not wait for the Godly Geniuses to return?" Master Feng asked.</p>

  <p>According to Wynn, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was an extraordinary sacred place for cultivation. The idea of sending the Godly Geniuses to this cultivation place was from the old man as well. And since it was an instruction from a True God, Master Feng didn't bother to ask and just sent them into the cultivation place. But he had no idea when they would come back.</p>

  <p>"We can't wait here doing nothing. We must help the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>We can slow down the Sacred race's invasion until the Godly Geniuses are back," Wynn said with a worried face.</p>

  <p>Wynn was Mike's disciple. He had taught him everything he knew about martial arts.</p>

  <p>Mike's wisdom was embodied by his disciples and they believed that their master's plans could turn even the most difficult situation into a success.</p>

  <p>That was why, no matter how bad the situation was, Wynn had never lost his confidence.</p>

  <p>But this time was different. Wynn had not that much confidence that they could win in this situation.</p>

  <p>As a True God, he knew about the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It was indeed an extraordinary sacred place for cultivation built by Holy Jay from the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how magical this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was, it was impossible to improve the strength of these Godly Geniuses to a level enough to save the Evolutionary Universe in just a short period of time. There was just no way…</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe and the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land observed the same time flow rate.</p>

  <p>Wynn, who was in the Evolutionary Universe, decided to finally lend a hand to the Humanity Alliance. Meanwhile in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Zheng was resting when his eyelids slightly trembled and suddenly opened. Then, a golden afterglow entered his pupils and rapidly rotated until it gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked confused. He sat up and looked around, but his head ached a little from the sudden awakening. What time was it now?</p>

  <p>It felt as if he was asleep for a long time.</p>
