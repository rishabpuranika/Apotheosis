<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1711 The Scattered Stones (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The sparring match between Luo Zheng and Tianming did not stop there.</p>

  <p>In this universe, there were myriad different ways of martial arts cultivation.</p>

  <p>And it all began first with what was called the self-enlightenment.</p>

  <p>The living creatures of this universe created and developed all of the cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>The methods of cultivation of the same range all had a common origin.</p>

  <p>And later on, this was further divided into different branches.</p>

  <p>The original cultivation method was derived from warriors' self-enlightenment.</p>

  <p>After the self-enlightenment method, the second way of cultivation was to receive an education.</p>

  <p>Some warriors generously imparted all of their martial arts comprehension to their disciples. And like a chain effect, these disciples then unselfishly spread out such precious knowledge to more people from generation to generation. For this reason, the emergence and establishment of sects and sacred places flourished.</p>

  <p>With cultivation based on the achievements of ancestors, this was a top-down approach. It was more often than not a way of refinement for all living creatures, as it was more widespread.</p>

  <p>Then practice and training came third after the first two methods.</p>

  <p>Now, this marked the onset of warriors' epiphany. Through engaging themselves in actual combat, warriors could further assess what they had learned. It was also the best way of resolving doubts or gaining new enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Those who had epiphanies or revelations during a fight would always benefit a lot. This kind of comprehension through practice and training was also a sort of self-enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Tianming could obtain no more comprehension by merely studying the Beginning Swordsmanship. He could only improve through practice and training.</p>

  <p>However, after he had ascended to the Upper World, he found out that most kinds of swordsmanship in the universe were crude and inferior compared to the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there were some excellent sword techniques in several particular places of the universe, but it was such a pity that he could not visit them freely.</p>

  <p>For example, the Sword Chamber, the Killing Sword Mountain, and the Sword Washing Pool...</p>

  <p>After reaching the Soul Sea Realm, Tianming still didn't display too much of his great sword skill in the tenth-grade sacred place he lived. He was afraid that the mighty warriors in that place would covet the extraordinary cultivation method he had discovered, and he would probably be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>But in the Illusion Battlefield, his reputation had quickly spread throughout the entire universe. He could spar with Luo Zheng with no more worries now.</p>

  <p>At the very outset, Zheng's sword skill was primarily inferior to his.</p>

  <p>He graciously offered to help him hone his skill.</p>

  <p>And currently, Zheng's swordsmanship had improved so quickly that he already caught up with Tianming.</p>

  <p>They incessantly continued to exchange slashes, hacking, chopping, and stabbing at each other.</p>

  <p>Those warriors, who happened to have a strong knowledge of swords, watched the fight with great interest. They desired to comprehend something from the mysterious momentum of the two swords because they all knew they would benefit a lot by reading the way those two swords moved.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, those who didn't understand swords felt it was such a boring fight. They couldn't tell what was going on at all.</p>

  <p>Thus, a strange situational event occurred in the universe.</p>

  <p>The warriors with lower-based cultivation and with poor perceptions all felt sleepy and bored as they watched the sparring in the picture above their Illusion Spaces. From time to time, a round of angry curses for the two fighters could be heard, blaming the two for their boring fight.</p>

  <p>As for those with higher-based cultivation, they intently stared at the two figures with bright eyes, too afraid that they would miss even the slightest of the whole fight. They even mentally repeated and imitated the moves as they watched closely and excitedly outside the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>One hour passed.</p>

  <p>Then two hours...</p>

  <p>Then four hours...</p>

  <p>Then a brilliant light suddenly flickered in Tianming's eyes like a bright star.</p>

  <p>Soon, an invisible momentum began to spiral around him.</p>

  <p>The tremendous flow of energy known as momentum didn't break the Heaven Earth Board under his feet or didn't even bring about a light breeze.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, over a hundred stones on the Heaven Earth Board were pushed away by the momentum and scattered away from their original positions.</p>

  <p>"The stones are moved by his power!"</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"Those stones were stationary even when the entire Heaven Earth Board broke. How come his momentum can shift them?"</p>

  <p>Although it would be exaggerating to say that a fight between Soul Sea Realm warriors had the power to annihilate the world, but at the very least, it could destroy mountains and rivers.</p>

  <p>This Heaven Earth Board, which was one million feet long and one million feet wide, had already been destroyed several times by these warriors during their fights.</p>

  <p>Like for example, the hit of Kurt's Nine-ring Staff, and Lucille's stamp with her tiptoes.</p>

  <p>At any rate, none of the warriors had been able to affect these stones.</p>

  <p>They had remained where the mysterious woman had arranged them.</p>

  <p>They had never moved from their spots, nor had they been harmed by any attacks.</p>

  <p>But now, Tianming's momentum managed to move them.</p>

  <p>Because of this disturbance, the calculations about the future, which were confirmed earlier, would also change dramatically.</p>

  <p>Many people fixated their gaze on the Heaven Earth Board and observed the new situation unfolded. Immediately, their faces all darkened.</p>

  <p>The white stones, which had been tight in defense, now had a big loophole in their territory.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a group of black stones invaded the white stones' territory.</p>

  <p>"This is a very dangerous circumstance!"</p>

  <p>Nathan's eyes narrowed in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What will happen?" Lawson tilted his head and asked.</p>

  <p>Nathan had a solemn expression on his face as he continued to calculate.</p>

  <p>His calculation was even quite faster than some Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"The white side will lose. I wonder if that woman will reset the scattered stones." Nathan finished his words, and then he looked up at the sky.</p>
