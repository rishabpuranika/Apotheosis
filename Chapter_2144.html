<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2144 The Han Clan's Ancestral Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was common knowledge that divine might coins were extremely rare in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Not even a True God had many of those coins, let alone those warriors who busied themselves outside the city their whole lives. They had to accumulate enough points to enter the city and exchange their divine might coins, which would eventually end up in someone else's hand.</p>

  <p>That was why when a guard of the Mirror City heard that a proving godly warrior say that he had a divine might coin, he prompted, "You have a divine might coin?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head and took out a divine might coin.</p>

  <p>The Mirror City guard's eyes lit up at the sight of the round, black piece in Zheng's hand. With a wave of his hand, the divine might coin in Zheng's grasp was taken away from him!</p>

  <p>The other Mirror City guards who stood next to the first guard looked at Zheng as well and scanned him from head to toe.</p>

  <p>If a proving godly warrior like Zheng possessed a divine might coin, it must either be a gift from a True God or he simply got really lucky and found a treasure some True Gods might've left behind.</p>

  <p>If it was the former, then it didn't matter. But if it was the latter, then this kid probably had more than one divine might coin.</p>

  <p>A few moments passed and the Mirror City guard continued to examine Zheng's coin. "Can I go in now?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The guard inspected the small round piece one more time before he looked at Zheng with a smile. "Not yet," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng asked again. He was confused. He had already presented the coin, what more could they ask?</p>

  <p>The guard laughed and said, "I'm sorry, but two divine might coins are required. One is not enough to enter the Mirror City."</p>

  <p>Many True Gods most likely lived in the Mirror City. Although the guards in front of Zheng were probably just proving godly warriors, he did not wish to stir up trouble. Thus, he did his best to be amiable despite the guards' display of arrogance.</p>

  <p>However, this Mirror City guard obviously tried to rip him off. Zheng raised one brow and said, "They say that you only need to pay one divine might coin to enter the city."</p>

  <p>The guard shook his head. "Today, the price has risen. You need to pay two coins to enter the city, if you pay one less..." He pointed to the crowd of warriors at the side. "You'll have to take on missions like them to save up enough points for you to enter the city!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to become a Mirror City guard. The guards at the city gate had many connections to some important figures in the divine city. Even if Zheng only had one divine might coin, they still wouldn't let go of the opportunity to take his coin for themselves.</p>

  <p>If Zheng presented two divine might coins, it would certainly make the guards happier.</p>

  <p>They'd seen too many people like Zheng, who looked plain and even dubious. It was usually easy to handle people like him as with just a few words, those warriors would go away. What could a proving godly warrior do at the gates of a divine city?</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng would not take out a second divine might coin. His face turned cold as he said, "I don't have time to accept missions."</p>

  <p>"Then come back when you have earned the second divine might coin," the guard said mockingly as he gently juggled the divine might coin in his hand.</p>

  <p>When the coin was up in the air, Zheng's eyes suddenly glowed with a golden light!</p>

  <p>Since Master Evil had warned him not to stir up any trouble in the Mirror City, he had restrained his soul and concealed all of its sharpness.</p>

  <p>However, the people in the divine land were just as nasty as those in the universe, if not worse. Nice people were always oppressed.</p>

  <p>The small golden swords in Zheng's soul flashed while an extremely sharp soul suppression erupted. Then, the invisible arrows flew past the Mirror City guard's soul.</p>

  <p>The guards at the gates were only world lords.</p>

  <p>In addition, there was a great difference in strength between the martial artists of the same level in the divine land and those in the universe.</p>

  <p>For example, Woolley, who was a Spirit Transformation Realm martial artist, had a high cultivation base but a terrifying lack of understanding of martial arts.</p>

  <p>The world lords were the same as well. Most of the divine citizens who managed to become proving godly warriors didn't even know how to practice the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Very few world lords among them had successfully trained their souls to Jasper Fighting Souls, and even fewer had gone for Silver Fighting Souls and Gold Fighting Souls. Although Zheng's soul was still a Gold Fighting Soul, his soul pressure wasn't weaker than a True God's because of the Evolutionary Divine Arts he had been cultivating.</p>

  <p>The small arrows that were formed from the soul pressure flew out, but did not harm the guard's soul. However, the pressure contained inside the arrows caused a chill to run down the guard's spine, and his entire body from bones to muscles had become completely stiff.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff…"</p>

  <p>The sharp invisible arrows finally hit the city gate behind him and left two small scratches on the gate's tough surface.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng tried his best to prevent his soul pressure from spreading out, the row of Mirror City guards still felt afraid of the terrifying golden light that flashed through Zheng's eyes. They even froze in place!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the divine might coin still spun in the air and eventually fell.</p>

  <p>Zheng's right hand stretched out at lightning speed and caught the coin. He then waved it in front of the guard. "Put it away," he said in an aloof voice. He stuffed the coin into the guard's pocket, and then passed through the rest of them and entered the gates without looking back.</p>

  <p>The guards at the scene finally regained their senses when the door slammed shut. They looked at each other, but did not say a word.</p>

  <p>There were very few talents suddenly appearing in the divine land, much different from the universe.</p>

  <p>A successful talent usually came from a powerful background and had a backer behind them. From a warrior's potential and talent, one could even judge where they came from.</p>

  <p>A small mountain village? Born in an ordinary divine city? Or, did someone train them in a central divine city? Those successful talents could also come from the four divine trees or some wealthy clan from a Floating Island. There were subtle differences between those warriors, and it was quite easy for people with a good eye to tell them apart.</p>

  <p>The Mirror City guards did not have a vision, but it didn't mean that they were stupid. At the very least, they had the ability to discern what was going on.</p>

  <p>They couldn't fathom the soul level Zheng had displayed at all. The central divine cities couldn't have been able to nurture such a strong warrior, so they surmised that Zheng must be at least from the four divine trees, or even a Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Thus, let alone a mere guard, even ordinary True Gods wouldn't dare to provoke someone like Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Mirror City guard touched the divine might coin in his pocket and gulped. In the end, he did not utter a single word.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he had controlled himself well. He warned the guards but didn't cause any trouble. At the very least, he didn't catch the attention of the True Gods in the Mirror City. After all, Zheng's current identity was a delicate matter.</p>

  <p>After he had entered the Mirror City, the aura in his whole body completely disappeared like melted snow on a bright, sunny day.</p>

  <p>Although the Mirror City was one of the seven divine cities in the Vast Sky Region, it wasn't as big as Zheng had imagined. So, he asked Master Evil why the divine city wasn't built much larger. "Why does it have to be big?" Master Evil asked in return.</p>

  <p>While it could be said that some Holy Cities in the universe were almost boundless, the divine cities were built for a different purpose.</p>

  <p>In order to expand, the tenth-grade sacred places in the universe continued to absorb talents, and produced even more world lords who would eventually fight each other to become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the divine land had been in development for countless divine eras, so it was very much stable.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that there were no talents in the divine land, but they were just too few to be taken into account. Thus, the different powers weren't so eager to expand their influence. In any case, those rich clans on the Floating Islands changed their rankings only every few years. Besides, it was difficult for a True God from those clans to reach the consummation of True God level, and even harder for them to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason that the distribution of resources was directed towards the great powers. The competition among the martial artists at the bottom level was even more brutal!</p>

  <p>Zheng wasted no time in following Master Evil's instructions and rushed to the west side of Mirror City. It was the only place where he could use the teleportation channel to travel across the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>"The Vast Sky Region is just really a small region with a total of three powers stationed in the place. Those three major powers control all the divine cities within the region, but those who know better are aware that those powers are nothing more than puppets of the Han Clan. You can use the teleportation channel to head to the Six-Burden Region to the south of the Vast Sky Region, which is the Han Clan's ancestral land," said Master Evil.</p>

  <p>"The Han Clan? Ancestral land?" Zheng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>Master Evil nodded and continued, "That's right. The Holy Emperor of the Han Clan became a Holy Being 130 divine eras ago. The current Han Clan is also one of the wealthiest clans on the Floating Islands. During the past divine eras of my absence, its power has probably increased still more. Since the Six-Burden Region is the Han Clan's ancestral land, it is the place where you can go to find a chance."</p>
