  <p>
</p>

  <p>How could so many powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace let Emperor Charm approach Eastern Emperor Taiyi?</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors, who still had the strength to fight, instantly acted.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm was shuttling through the space, and they couldn't capture him, so they all shifted their target and immediately pounced on those corpses.</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden also joined them.</p>

  <p>These powerful warriors grabbed the corpses and dragged them to the opposite direction. The Other Shore Power they emitted formed a joint force that couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>As a result, Emperor Charm's attacking momentum was forcefully stopped.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm showed up from the void and looked back at the people holding the corpses behind him. There was a glint of killing intent in his eyes. He turned back swiftly and crashed into the nearest person.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Relying on Mahoney's Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm was practically able to go on the rampage in hand-to-hand combat. With his wild, violent fighting method, four people who were dragging a corpse were sent flying by his attack in an instant.</p>

  <p>Without any pause, Emperor Charm went straight to another corpse Despite the fact that she was treating Feng Ge on the ground below, Flamine's attention to the situation above never decreased. Seeing that Emperor Charm was gradually gaining the upper hand, she became more and more anxious.</p>

  <p>She had exerted a lot of energy in this battle, so she was practically at the end of her tether now— she could do nothing to help.</p>

  <p>In her anxiety, she looked around. When her sight fell on Zheng, an idea suddenly popped out in her mind. She said, "Zheng, go and carry Eastern Emperor Taiyi on your back. Let's escape together!"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was the core essence of the Oneness Sky Palace. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Oneness Sky Palace would really be done for.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng answered, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had told the members of the Sun Crow race to fight against Emperor Charm together. However, the Bearing race was watching the scene from the other side. When they saw that Emperor Charm gained the upper hand, they seemed to want to join the battle and help Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Zheng sent some members of the Sun Crow race to stop Emperor Charm, while the rest was arranged by him to guard against the members of the Bearing race. At the very least, this arrangement should deter the Bearing race from acting rashly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze fell on Xun, Liusu and Nelly.</p>

  <p>The situation was critical now. Even though they met again, Zheng didn't talk much with them. The three girls were quite considerate— they stayed in a corner quietly when they couldn't help.</p>

  <p>"You can hide in my inner world first," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back then, he was willing to put them out of his inner world because the Oneness Sky Palace was very safe. But now that the Oneness Sky Palace was in turmoil, hiding in his inner world was the safest option for them.</p>

  <p>None of them objected to Zheng's suggestion. After all, they didn't have what it took to participate in a battle of this scale. If they stayed outside, they would only be a drag on Zheng.</p>

  <p>After taking the three girls into his inner world, Zheng's figure zoomed away so fast that he looked like he suddenly disappeared from where he was.</p>

  <p>Before long, he already appeared inside the hall.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked still calm. Since he was on the Other Shore, he didn't know what was happening here.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but let out a soft sigh when he saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi's serene expression.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for the Oneness Sky Palace, which Eastern Emperor Taiyi personally ran, to develop to this level. In the blink of an eye, however, it was already on the verge of destruction. Zheng couldn't help but sigh at this change.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand, took Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and carried him on his back. With one light leap, he already appeared by Flamine's side again.</p>

  <p>After dealing with Feng Ge's injuries, Flamine also carried her on her back.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was impossible for Feng Ge to withstand that blow with her own strength. A force worth fifteen thousand divine megatons was enough to tear her apart. However, when her Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, a Latent Theurgy that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had personally planted in her quietly became active. This protective Latent Theurgy had saved her life at such a critical moment.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was going to carry Eastern Emperor Taiyi away, the powerful warriors of the Bearing race, who had been watching from afar, finally became agitated and started to make their moves. They couldn't just let such a good opportunity slip away.</p>

  <p>Some members of the Sun Crow race noticed the uproar among the Bearing race. Vigilant expressions appeared on their faces. After all, Zheng had ordered them to block these people.</p>

  <p>"Guys, this is a good opportunity to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi. You guys work together and hold these birds back!" Hancock suddenly suggested.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Bearing race also knew that they couldn't delay any longer. They had to take advantage of the current opportunity, so they took out the Other Shore Tokens they had and rushed towards the members of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>While the powerful warriors of the two races were engaged in a fierce battle, Hancock squinted, took a step back, and directly used the Grand Teleportation. Along with a spatial fluctuation, he appeared next to Flamine and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>Hancock's sudden appearance made Flamine's expression change in an instant. As the divine flame of the Sun Crow race showed up in her hand, Flamine stretched her hand towards Hancock's head in her attempt to buy some time for Zheng to escape.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to stay any longer and hurried into the space channel.</p>

  <p>Flamine's strength had been weakened greatly in the battle, and her speed was also much slower than before.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Flamine stretched out her hand towards him, Hancock immediately moved and dodged Flamine easily. He bypassed her, stretched out his hand towards Zheng's back, grabbed the shoulder of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and pulled him violently.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already stepped into the space channel when he felt the weight of the burden on his back disappearing. He looked back, only to find that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been pulled away by Hancock and that he had stepped into the space channel alone.</p>

  <p>When Hancock captured Eastern Emperor Taiyi, a wild and arrogant smile bloomed on his face. In a flash, a scarlet dagger appeared in his other hand, and he swung it towards the top of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's head.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>In any case, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had stronger Chaotic Source Spirits than ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Hancock's scarlet dagger carried a force of tens of thousands of divine megatons. But despite the crisp sound, Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't damaged.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the endurance of Chaotic Source Spirits was still limited. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stabbed repeatedly, his Chaotic Source Spirits would be exhausted sooner or later. It was just a matter of time.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Flamine's face turned deathly pale. With Feng Ge on her back, she pounced over and tried to headbutt Hancock.</p>

  <p>Hancock didn't take her seriously. He casually kicked her away and stabbed the scarlet dagger towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi for the second time.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>A crisp sound once again rang. Eastern Emperor Taiyi's Chaotic Source Spirits withstood this attack again.</p>

  <p>"As expected of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, you've managed to withstand my strikes twice only with the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Now, let me see if you can withstand my third strike!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Hancock raised his scarlet dagger again.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the weak Feng Ge opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>Just now, Flamine had spent quite a while in treating Feng Ge's injuries so that her Soul of Light was gradually stabilized.</p>

  <p>The moment Feng Ge opened her eyes, she saw Hancock holding a dagger and trying to stab Eastern Emperor Taiyi with it. Despite her being still a little dazed, an unknown power burst inside her, and she directly pounced on Hancock.</p>

  <p>When Hancock saw Feng Ge rushed to him, his eyes glinted. Without thinking too much, he raised his dagger and swung it towards Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The dagger pierced into Feng Ge's neck. Blood spurted from her fair neck, and her head drooped to the side.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>Flamine let out a shrill scream.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng also appeared from the space channel. When he saw this scene, fury blazed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>However, Hancock nonchalantly threw Feng Ge to the side. He raised his scarlet dagger, intending to stab Eastern Emperor Taiyi again.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, the shadow of a giant bird suddenly appeared above Feng Ge's head.</p>

  <p>Along with the appearance of the shadow, a loud chirp that drew everyone's attention echoed around.</p>
