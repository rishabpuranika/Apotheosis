  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a fiend that had been living in the abyss ever since his earliest memory, Edmond was not one to let anyone dismiss his capabilities.</p>

  <p>His instincts told him that this woman wasn't someone to be trifled with, but he still raised his humongous fist and slammed it heavily in front of the woman.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The thunderous blow made a significant dent on the ground in front of the woman.</p>

  <p>A current of strong wind was stirred up by the punch, and this wind blew the woman's long hair into the air, flying like thin ribbons that were a thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>"Answer my question!" Edmond said coldly, still waiting for the woman's response.</p>

  <p>A faint smile played on the woman's lips as she told him, "You don't even know what you are. I am under no obligation to answer you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Edmond asked in a rumbling voice.</p>

  <p>In the world of fiends, they understood almost everything that went on.</p>

  <p>But he suddenly appeared in this world of mist for no apparent reason, and he was prevented from leaving by a powerful force that restricted his body.</p>

  <p>As much as he wanted to leave this place, he realized that it was beyond his ability. He also felt an intensely murderous intent in his heart.</p>

  <p>The murderous intent wasn't of his own will, but it kept persuading him to kill some creatures. He felt the will deep in his soul, and he couldn't do anything to resist it.</p>

  <p>It made Edmond feel miserable.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here," the woman told him coldly.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Edmond raised his fist again and directly smashed it straight down on the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman tilted her head upward slightly, as if to meet the fist that was slamming down on her.</p>

  <p>A single strand of her hair fluttered in the wind gently.</p>

  <p>Her hair was as soft as a swan's feather, but as the strand of hair floated upward, it was fortified with great strength and force as it was pulled tight.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>In a flash, the hair strand lightly grazed Edmond's gigantic arm.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Edmond's arm was cut in half. It fell from the sky and crashed on the ground, creating a huge crater.</p>

  <p>Blood spurted from his arm where it was detached, spraying everywhere like a crimson shower.</p>

  <p>Fizz!</p>

  <p>The scarlet blood melted and corroded everything in a crazy manner.</p>

  <p>Fiend's blood was highly corrosive to everything it came in contact with.</p>

  <p>Blood spurted everywhere, falling in all directions around the woman.</p>

  <p>Miraculously, not a drop fell upon her. It was not clear whether it was a coincidence or she had a special ability that enabled her to avoid being splattered.</p>

  <p>"You!" Edmond shouted, full of rage.</p>

  <p>But the woman already left and walked into the mist without a backwards look.</p>

  <p>A look of confusion was also written on her face.</p>

  <p>"This place... It was created by the will of good and evil --Truth of Goodwill and Malice. That should be in the Sunrest Wood. Everything here was created by the captain of the ship, whose fear created me?"</p>

  <p>During the past several years, she had shown herself only to very few people.</p>

  <p>Since she was already here, she thought it might be a good idea to meet the captain.</p>

  <p>At the same time, happening on the other side...</p>

  <p>"Good job!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard cheered Yan as they stared at the fallen form of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros on the ground. "The incarnations of fears are not as strong as we thought!"</p>

  <p>Actually, only Reinhard knew how strong the incarnations of fears were.</p>

  <p>The Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was probably the least powerful among them.</p>

  <p>But he was also sure that if these True Gods stopped resisting, the pressure on their group would be even greater and there would be a decreased chance that they would be able to pass through the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Reinhard realized that his companions needed to hear words of encouragement to help them face the next challenges.</p>

  <p>Yan's excellently executed moves did help those True Gods get back the confidence.</p>

  <p>He was glad that they were not alone to face the incarnations of fears. They had many powerful people who were part of the team, and he would need to rely on them to help them overcome the hardest part of their journey.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, you have seen for yourselves that these incarnations of fears are not as terrifying as you think. You can also rely on the avatars of those you trust the most. The avatars made from the Truth of Godly Way are not only indestructible, but also much stronger than yourselves," Reinhard told them, in hopes of further boosting their morale.</p>

  <p>"That's right! The fears we have deep in our hearts are not that strong!"</p>

  <p>"This is also a way to train your will. If you can overcome your own fears, it will also be a great boost to your will."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>While everyone was distracted with cheering each other up, they heard a rustling sound nearby.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Reinhard's Tribulation Exterminating Sword suddenly trembled and pointed suddenly to the direction of the sound.</p>

  <p>"Look out!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard's expression darkened into a scowl as everyone looked in the same direction.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>A small snake suddenly appeared in front of them, apparently materializing from the mist.</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces turned from serious and wary to amused and relieved after they saw the little snake clearly.</p>

  <p>It was actually an ordinary flower snake, and it was very common in the divine land. As even an ordinary divine citizen could kill it, it couldn't be considered a fierce beast.</p>

  <p>"Is this also an incarnation of fear?"</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, who will be afraid of such a little snake?"</p>

  <p>"How could someone be afraid of this..."</p>

  <p>"Whose incarnation of fear is it? Admit it quickly!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods only laughed.</p>

  <p>"That should be... It's me, I think."</p>

  <p>A raven-haired young man stepped forward, his expression unreadable.</p>

  <p>The young man's name was Burke Liu and he was from the Liu Clan.</p>

  <p>"Burke? Seriously? How could you be afraid of a tiny snake?"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you are a top-rank True God. How..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>One of the True Gods shot out an intense ray of light that chopped up the snake into several pieces. Most of the True Gods laughed mockingly at Burke.</p>

  <p>Only Reinhard sensed that something was wrong. He stared at Burke and asked, "Are you sure that your fear is this little snake?"</p>

  <p>Staring confusedly at the mist before him, Burke muttered, "Well, it might not actually be my fear. What I am afraid of should be... Snake Spirit. The Snake Spirit can form a sea of snakes. This little one is probably only one of them..."</p>

  <p>He seemed to fall into a miserable reminiscence of the past as he spoke.</p>

  <p>He remembered as his father's life was taken by the sea of snakes.</p>

  <p>"Snake Spirit!"</p>

  <p>It was just at that moment that Reinhard realized why Burke looked so upset at the sight of the little snake.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished talking, the True Gods all heard waves of hissing coming from all directions from the surrounding mist.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Reinhard's Tribulation Exterminating Sword was spinning crazily at a furious speed.</p>

  <p>"It's a huge group of snakes," Zheng stated as he tried to make out the snake shadows that were steadily shining in the mist.</p>

  <p>"No... It's the snake sea!" Fear was evidently written all over Burke's facial expression and body language.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, countless snakes simultaneously rushed out of the mist.</p>

  <p>There were snakes of different types and sizes, ranging from palm-sized snakes to gigantic snakes, and even variously colored venomous snakes!</p>

  <p>Some snakes were ones that were ordinarily found in the divine land, but there were also a number of snakes that came from the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, fly to the sky!" Reinhard ordered, "Make sure you find that Snake Spirit. Otherwise, we'll all be drowned in an endless sea of snakes."</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>At the same time as the True Gods launched themselves into the sky, long and thin shadows also shot upwards.</p>

  <p>It seemed that there were also countless flying snakes congregating from all directions.</p>

  <p>"Kill these snakes!"</p>

  <p>"It's just some little snakes. What are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Right, we True Gods are not afraid of any poison."</p>

  <p>The True Gods began their counterattack.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly came up with an idea, and Xun immediately rushed towards the sea of snakes. As she slashed her long spear gently, a thin arc-shaped spear light spread outwards quickly. In a flash, more than a thousand of the snakes were cut in half.</p>

  <p>'It's not that hard, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods had also found out that the snakes were significantly easy to kill. They didn't have a hard time eliminating them so they were off-guard.</p>

  <p>They soon realized that it was all just an illusion.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a dark shadow estimated to be as high as thirty feet materialized from deep within the mist. As the shadow approached closer, they discovered that it was a great mass of wriggling, writhing snakes entangled altogether.</p>

  <p>This was the real snake sea.</p>
