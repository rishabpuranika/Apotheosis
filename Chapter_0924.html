<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Esther looked at Malcom. One after another, waves of life vitality spread out, and hundreds of flowers bloomed, forming a semi-circular domain of protection for everyone within.</p>

  <p>It was only after reaching the Soul Sea Realm could one have a domain of his or her own. However, Esther's cultivation method was special, allowing her to create her own "Myriad Flowers Domain."</p>

  <p>"You think you will be able to stop me with just these flowers?" Malcom snorted contemptuously. The pair of wings on his back flapped as he took a step forward in the air. A fist shot out and the floral domain was instantly destroyed.</p>

  <p>Esther's expression turned grim while a smug smile appeared on Malcom's face. In the past, she was unbeatable, even Maurice wasn't a match for her.</p>

  <p>But now, she couldn't even withstand a single punch from Malcom.</p>

  <p>But she didn't seem too perturbed. With a wave of her hands, more flowers bloomed to protect them. She said calmly, "Malcom, don't you feel the changes around us?"</p>

  <p>"Changes?" He squinted his eyes and looked at the fog. Suddenly, he remembered something very important. His expression changed. "This is..."</p>

  <p>Just then Rehaan, Shane and the other two members of the Night Group rushed over. Rehaan shouted loudly, "Bad news! Malcom, we seem to have fallen into..."</p>

  <p>"Fog..." Malcom completed Rehaan's sentence.</p>

  <p>Fog was a very common sight on the Sea God Continent. The weather would become foggy when winter was about to pass and spring was about to come.</p>

  <p>But here in the Dark Nether Cave, it was different. There was only one place here that had fog, and that was the core area. Encountering the fog was equivalent to entering the core area.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Dark Nether Cave had fog was still an unsolved mystery to the numerous warriors on the Sea God Continent. However, every single warrior in the Tower of Sin was grateful to the fog.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave was filled with Dark Nether Death Light all year round. Except for the monsters inside the Cave, none of the creatures outside could fight the Dark Nether Death Light. No matter how powerful they were, the Dark Nether Death Light would turn them to pus.</p>

  <p>It was believed that the Dark Nether Death Light originated from the core area of the Dark Nether Cave. However, every year, for a period of time, fog would rise up from the core area. It was precisely this fog that caused the Dark Nether Death Light to weaken greatly, giving the warriors in the Tower of Sin an opportunity to enter the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Without this layer of fog, no one on the Sea God Continent would have ever been able to set foot in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors were grateful for the fog, they were also deeply afraid of it. The fog covered the entire core area. Who knew what kind of evil existence lurked in the core area? Nobody had any knowledge of it. In the past, some attempts had been made to learn about its inhabitants. All races had once joined hands to explore the fog, but not a single one had survived.</p>

  <p>Hence, Malcom's and Esther's fears were understandable. The core area was a forbidden place that was unpredictable.</p>

  <p>"No! That can't be possible!" Malcom pulled out a piece of sheepskin from his space ring. It contained the map drawn by the ogres. "We should not have stepped into the core area. This cannot be the core area!" he cried in panic.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Esther also took out their respective maps. After comparing them for a few seconds, Fabian shook his head and said, "This is not the core area, but..."</p>

  <p>"But the core area has extended," finished Esther with an anxious expression.</p>

  <p>There was a very clear boundary between the outer area and inner area.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the monsters of the outer area would not enter the inner area.</p>

  <p>However, there was no such border between the inner area and the core area. Wherever the fog spread, that would become the core area.</p>

  <p>With a mysterious smile, Xun stared at Yolande, who looked expressionless. For some reason, Xun had been on guard against Yolande from the beginning to the end. She heard Fabian and Esther talking about the fog and the core area, but her expression didn't change at all.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's brows were furrowed. While he was being chased by Malcom, his space ring had become hotter and hotter. The Jade Butterfly in his space ring had already turned into a ball of fire.</p>

  <p>This meant that the direction that the Jade Butterfly was currently pointing towards was inside the fog. So, the inheritance that Immortal Mist was referring to must be in the core area.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng still maintained his composure, he knew that the situation was not looking good. There must be some strange things hidden within the famed core area. The most frightening thing was that they knew nothing about the fog. It must be very dangerous in there, but Luo Zheng didn't know how to overcome this obstacle.</p>

  <p>Esther stared at Malcom indifferently and asked, "Now, do you still want to fight?"</p>

  <p>Malcom's expression was a bit strange. He had remained at the bottom of the Tower of Sin to cultivate and was very clear on his mission. One could even say that he was a daredevil. His mission was to kill Luo Zheng at all costs. He had to ensure that Luo Zheng would not leave the Dark Nether Cave, even if it meant sacrificing his own life for it.</p>

  <p>However, after Malcom entered the core area, his mind had somehow changed.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, he didn't want to die.</p>

  <p>According to his plan, after getting rid of Luo Zheng, he would continue to hide at the bottom of the Tower of Sin and in the future, he would be the sole ruler of the tower.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, war sages would also be affected by the curse of the Cursed Land. However, based on past experience, the curse in the Tower of Sin would not burst on the spot, but would instead last for a month.</p>

  <p>In the past, a top-level war lord was promoted to a war sage within the Tower of Sin. However, the power of the curse did not descend upon him immediately. It was only a month later that he had been killed by the curse.</p>

  <p>Malcom believed that as long as he restricted his stay in the Tower of Sin to just about half a month and then went back to the Dark Nether Cave, he wouldn't be affected by the power of curse.</p>

  <p>As his strength increased, step by step, he would soon become a high level war sage and then gradually, a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. In the future, he would become the real controller of the Tower of Sin, and even the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place would have to respect him.</p>

  <p>After all, with all his strength, who would dare to take him on in the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>But who would have thought that he would fall into the fog while he was chasing after Luo Zheng. This had completely ruined his plan. He was quite baffled now.</p>

  <p>"No! I'll kill Luo Zheng first, then we can discuss how to leave this fog!" Malcom pointed his blade at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on Esther's face. "Right now, everyone is already trapped in the fog. Let's put the disputes aside first before we leave the fog.</p>

  <p>Moreover, do you think we will let you kill Luo Zheng so easily?"</p>

  <p>After devouring the fruit of Dark Sky Mage, Malcom had indeed become very powerful. However, Esther had some trump cards up her sleeve too. If both sides used their full strength, they would definitely fight to the death.</p>

  <p>The final outcome would be hard to predict.</p>

  <p>"She's right. Malcom, let's think of a way to get out of this fog!" Shane said with a hopeful expression. But in his heart, he thought, today was the unluckiest day of his life. If he had known this, he wouldn't have informed Malcom about Zheng's whereabouts earlier. He would rather be torn to pieces by the Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves than die in this damned place.</p>

  <p>Malcom took a deep breath. "The fog is only a legend. No one knows what is exactly in it. I don't think we can't leave this place," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew much about the fog, and most of what they knew about the fog came from rumors and speculation. It was said that once somebody was trapped in the fog, it was impossible to leave it, but that might not be true.</p>

  <p>It was just some fog. Was it really enough to trap so many warriors?</p>

  <p>"Let's just agree to disagree for the time being and put aside our differences.</p>

  <p>We'll talk about it after we leave the fog," Esther suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad idea!"</p>

  <p>Shane said with a flattering smile.</p>

  <p>Malcom glared at Shane fiercely, causing him to immediately shut up. He then nodded, "Alright! Let's talk after we leave the fog! Let's go back the way we came."</p>

  <p>The path they had taken to get there was not complicated. This area was completely barren, without even a small mound of soil. It was extremely desolate.</p>

  <p>Two teams of people, one in front and the other behind, carefully made their way back.</p>

  <p>The fog had been rather thin a moment ago, but now it was as thick as milk.</p>

  <p>Everyone's vision was blocked by the blinding fog.</p>
