  <p>What the Star Falcon had said pierced like a dagger into Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>His eyes immediately widened, blazing with anger and a thirst for blood.</p>

  <p>And even though the man who had delivered the message already knew the possibility of death, he couldn't help but tremble at the sight of Zheng's change in expression.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng had a firm belief that the Pear Hill was a good place for Yan to be taken care of. After all, they had strength that surpassed the Oneness Sky Palace. Even the super forces, like the Sun Crow race, did not dare cross a line with them.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng proved to be a little naive.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng's and Elvinia's corporal bodies were growing to be more and more threatening, the four big races would do anything to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the connection between Yan and Zheng had been revealed when they were in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>That gave the four races an advantage to lure Zheng and Elvinia into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>As planned, they attacked Yan even before they proved Tianxing's identity to be Zheng. Their rough, unethical tactics just proved that they were in a hurry to kill him.</p>

  <p>Several members of the Guide Weasel race grew worried as they had sensed Zheng's strong, powerful aura. They had so many questions; If Zheng was a member of the Oneness Sky Palace, didn't that mean his sibling was a member too? And if so, why was she captured by the Star Falcon race at such a critical time?</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Zheng asked firmly, but in a hushed tone.</p>

  <p>Because the Star Falcon race used Yan to threaten him, this probably meant that his sister was safe for the time being.</p>

  <p>In actuality, taking Yan as a hostage was not the idea of the Star Falcon race— it was the Sun Crow race's. That was a problem for Zheng, who just wanted to know what it would take for them to release Yan safely.</p>

  <p>"Poor Zheng," the Star Falcon scoffed, "you should probably ask the Guide Weasel race and the Giants to withdraw their troops first."</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel race and the Giants, led by Clyde and Raul, were headed towards the Sky Water City. Because the Star Falcon race had weakened, they were in no place to suppress these races. If these two races stepped foot into the city, it would ultimately lead to the annihilation of the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>"If I do so, will you let go of Yan after they retreat?" Zheng asked, making sure that it was not a trick.</p>

  <p>"If you want to save Yan, you'll have to make your way to the Dark Region yourself," said the Star Falcon.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed. He sneered at the man before him. "Then why would I ask the Guide Weasel race and the Giants to retreat?"</p>

  <p>Though in deep distress, Zheng had a point. The initial purpose of taking Yan was to send Zheng into the Dark Region, and nothing else. Asking the two races to retreat was not supposed to be part of the arrangement.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, if you don't do that.. your sister will die!" the Star Falcon hissed, threatening Zheng even more. There was a flash of panic in his eyes, but it only lasted for a second. Zheng was determined to save his sister by all means.</p>

  <p>Lowering his head and closing his eyes, Zheng thought hard. Then he turned his head saying, "Notify Clyde and Raul and tell them that I have asked them to come back."</p>

  <p>"Sir..." a Guide Weasel trailed off, hesitant to go through with the orders.</p>

  <p>"Do as I say," Zheng ordered, and his voice was tense and stern.</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel shuffled off right away, ready to fulfill Zheng's order.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Zheng turned to the Star Falcon and said, "I know that your purpose is to send me to the Dark Region. And even if they don't withdraw the troops, I am certain that my sister won't die."</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words sent the Star Falcon in a state of anxiety. How could he catch a lie that had been so strategically planned out?</p>

  <p>"So, tell me," Zheng demanded calmly. "Who kidnapped my sister in the Dark Region?"</p>

  <p>"It was... It was the black monkeys," the Star Falcon replied, refusing to lie even anymore.</p>

  <p>"Well then, you may go now," Zheng uttered without looking back.</p>

  <p>The other Guide Weasels followed him, and they made their way into the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of his mission, the Star Falcon intended to meet Zheng with the idea that he could die. He had no idea that Zheng wasn't even going to lay a finger on him. Soon enough, his nervousness eased and he noticed that he had been sweating in fright the whole time.</p>

  <p>"Splash..." His sweat dripped.</p>

  <p>In a hurry, he spread his wings and left the Myriad Spirits City in a panic.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the City Guard House, Elvinia was concerned as she saw Zheng enter with a look of irritation on his face. "What happened?" she asked soothingly.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved the question off and extended his hands towards her, "Hand me the candles and the Darkness Fruits."</p>

  <p>Elvinia's eyes widened, "Are you going to the Dark Region?" Candles and the Darkness Fruits were the keys to entering the Dark Region, but she could not comprehend why Zheng would want to return to such a horrible place.</p>

  <p>"Just give them to me," he snapped, "and stop asking so many questions!"</p>

  <p>The last thing he wanted to do was stress out Elvinia, who needed a lot more rest. Zheng intended to go to the Dark Region alone.</p>

  <p>However, Elvinia would not back down for anything. A cold expression crossed her face and she gripped hard onto her space ring, "Whatever you're going there for, I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>The ring was in Elvinia's keeping, and Zheng would only be able to have it if she let him.</p>

  <p>Zheng narrowed his gaze on her and expressed with all seriousness what had happened outside the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>Being such a smart individual, it took her no time to absorb everything Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The plan was simple— since the Sun Crow race assumed that creatures of the Other Shore could not deal with Zheng, they were going to have him tortured in the Dark Region instead.</p>

  <p>"Did they not recall that Dark Region creatures stand no chance against me?" Elvinia chuckled in confidence.</p>

  <p>Though creatures in the Dark Region were a thousand times stronger than those in the Light Region, she was unafraid of them. She was the bane of the Dark Region creatures.</p>

  <p>"Either they don't know about it, or they have other plans for you," Zheng pointed out. "Like putting you against another purified being."</p>

  <p>Apparently, there happened to be another purified being within Stage Fourteen. This being was said to be far stronger and more powerful than any ordinary living creature on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"But if that purified being stood on their side, he or she would have already come to kill us, right?" Elvinia went on, trying to figure out what would happen.</p>

  <p>Purified beings had the ability to freely travel through both the Light and the Dark Regions. If they had a purified being on their side, they should not have gone through the trouble to lure Zheng and Elvinia into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Zheng was frustrated that he couldn't grasp their plan. "Whatever." He shook it off. "Let's just go to the Dark Region first. We need to find those black monkeys first!"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Elvinia had already come into contact with the monkeys when they were at Stage Thirteen. They were chased and attacked by them, and almost died at the hands of those pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng was weak. He did not have the power to put up a fight against them, but this time, he was different.</p>

  <p>They were more prepared than ever.</p>

  <p>About an hour had passed and they went through the ridge in between the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthly Dark Mountain. Eventually, they arrived at the edge of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>When Elvinia was just about to light up the Dark Region, Zheng suddenly lifted his arm and stopped her.</p>

  <p>"We're here to save my sister," he whispered. "Don't make too much noise."</p>

  <p>Yan was in the hands of ruthless, unforgiving creatures. If they had found out that he was already in the Dark Region, they might kill her soon.</p>

  <p>They had to attack by surprise.</p>

  <p>Thus, each of them ate a Darkness Fruit before stepping into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>They had to be stealthy and careful, especially based on their past experience. Elvinia had opened the crack of light before, and all the Dark Region's creatures within a radius of a hundred miles were destroyed. This left the place deserted and burnt to a crisp; Zheng had seen it with his own eyes that day.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was stunned to see her power, and the consequences of her actions.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that an electric light shocked her mind, and opened a crack in the sky. She fainted when the crack opened, and that was the end of it.</p>
