<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2262 Consecutive Victories (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At this point, Alfredo could only let out an awkward smile. On that note, he turned around and left reluctantly without another word.</p>

  <p>Around the same time, Joy turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Don't blame him.</p>

  <p>Everyone has their own responsibility."</p>

  <p>Alfredo had been wanting to drive Luo Zheng out of the Han Clan's Floating Island ever since he heard Sheridan was killed by him. As the head of the Han Clan, it was appropriate for him to do so in order to seek the best interest of the clan and to make sure he kept everything as hands on as possible.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Zheng responded. "And my responsibility is to earn as many points as I can." He let out a faint sigh and smiled.</p>

  <p>Everyone faces challenges, and anyone in high position or authority is not an exception to that. When one is not strong enough, they can't blame others who have ignored them. In the end, it's really the survival of the fittest.</p>

  <p>Through it all, Joy was afraid that Luo Zheng would burst in anger at Alfredo.</p>

  <p>She was relieved to see Zheng's calm expression. She sighed and giggled, wondering how well Mike was able to train Luo Zheng for him to be such an excellent young man.</p>

  <p>She knew that Holy Jay had a knack for studying and solving difficult problems, Holy Bromley was good at exploring and creating, and Holy Mike had expertise in strategic planning and organizing overall arrangements.</p>

  <p>In the past, Mike, who had previously made a few mistakes, was attacked by the members of the Hall of Holy Beings and got into a dangerous situation. For sure, he must have already planned to make Luo Zheng avenge himself. However, Joy didn't expect that the entire Evolutionary Universe was created by Mike, just for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was impossible for Mike to take everything under his control. But for some reason, luck was on his side and his strategy brought out the best results.</p>

  <p>At the very least, Luo Zheng had achieved Mike's expectations step by step over the years that he had been training. Now, Luo Zheng had walked more than half of the way, and was finally walking away for good. The remaining path was the most difficult part.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Hall of True Gods, Luo Zheng swung open the door.</p>

  <p>Everyone who saw him was brought to a commotion, and whispers started to fill the air once again.</p>

  <p>There were only two months left before the rankings of Floating Islands above the Time Sea would be determined. In order to keep their disciples motivated and determined, the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands had announced various tempting rewards one after another.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the atmosphere in the Hall of True Gods grew tenser and tenser the closer the deadline got.</p>

  <p>Some disciples from the big clans who used to stay long enough to finish three matches and then make their way home, were now hovering around in the Hall of True Gods all day long.</p>

  <p>During this time, the Jade Wall of Legends grew to become extremely popular. In order to enter the Arena of Legends, competitions would often take place in front of the Jade Wall among the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Two months... There's not much time left for me," said Luo Zheng. He looked over at the low-rank True Gods in the Hall of True Gods before returning to his room. There, he was to choose his opponent for his battle.</p>

  <p>Once his door closed, people began to whisper and wonder again.</p>

  <p>"It seems that anonymous man is back."</p>

  <p>"For some reason, he didn't choose his opponent, nor did he give others the chance to choose him. He should be planning to choose his opponent at random."</p>

  <p>"How confident of him!"</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Hall of True Gods, it was unnecessary to gather in the hall like how everyone was doing. If one had confidence in their own strength, all they had to do was choose someone at random and defeat them. It was that simple.</p>

  <p>In fact, for the vast majority of the low-rank True Gods, it was common knowledge to choose your opponent carefully so that you could have advantage in battle. At this point, people had learned to restrain their auras to appear weak. They would do anything and everything to increase their chances of winning.</p>

  <p>Other than choosing an opponent, warriors could also come into an agreement with someone in the Hall of True Gods in which the winner of the fight would obtain a certain amount of divine might coins. They did this to make the battles more exciting for themselves.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was only interested in earning points as he was 100% confident in his strength and abilities. Hence, he didn't once take a glance of interest in the battles that were fought for divine might coins.</p>

  <p>But even though he was not interested, people paid a lot of attention to him. As a proving godly warrior, he was so conspicuous among those True Gods.</p>

  <p>When the anonymous man had just won two consecutive wins, he drew the attention of a few powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, regarded as the "anonymous man," challenged warriors who were way above his level, yet he still managed to win two consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>This was something very unusual, and that was why people were drawn to it.</p>

  <p>Later on, Luo Zheng won four matches in a row, which naturally caused more commotion among the people.</p>

  <p>After seeing his advances, wealthy clans on the Floating Islands began to investigate Zheng's identity in secret, but he didn't show anything special from the beginning to the end. The four men who went against Luo Zheng also got nothing about his identity, and the only thing they noticed was the two golden rays of light in Zheng's eyes. They resembled the Eyes of Fire God, but they couldn't be sure because he didn't use the theurgy of the Eyes of Fire God.</p>

  <p>The clans began to pay closer attention to the anonymous man. If anyone was able to gather information, these people would naturally report it to their own clans for advantage.</p>
