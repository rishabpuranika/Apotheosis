<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 188 The Killing Intention (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng stood in the crowd and stared at the general. The man looked strange, and Zheng had never seen him before.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I leave? Who are you?" he asked in a deep voice. If someone came looking for him, that could only spell bad news.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone whose head was covered with gauze appeared from the side. "Zheng, I have sworn that you will die with your boots on," he said menacingly. "Did you naturally think you can run for your life?"</p>

  <p>Even with his face completely concealed, and only his eyes were seen, Zheng still recognized his voice. It was Yale. Before the demon attacked the city, Zheng had knocked some sense into him a few times.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's Yale. What did you do? Did you really ask your brother to come here?" he asked casually, though he grasped the flying blade in his hand.</p>

  <p>The general before his eyes was powerful. Apart from him, there were two soldiers on the side.</p>

  <p>The soldiers appeared to be at the grade six of nature level. However, based on their decisive breath, their strength should not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng's own strength was far more powerful than what should be in the realm. Thus, he did not blindly judge the opponent's strength.</p>

  <p>"I am Josef. I have heard about you from my younger brother. They said you've offended many members of our Zhuge family, such as Chad and Fren. Now, you hit Yale? Very few people dare to offend anyone in our family. Today, you came to White Emperor City where I will treat you well. My suggestion, however, is that you cut your own arms by yourself, wear this chain, and follow me. Otherwise... You will meet your doom!" As soon as Josef uttered the last words, he whipped out a chain used to capture prisoners, and belted it on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Cut my arms by myself?" Zheng raised his brows first, and then laughed loudly as though he heard a sarcastic joke. In a dauntless manner, he stated, "You are just a counselor. As a member of the imperial army, can you really act without being given direct orders in White Emperor City?"</p>

  <p>"As the counselor of the imperial army, I certainly can't ignore the military rules. Regardless, I think no one would dare to talk behind my back if I deal with some commoners. In this situation, I can torture and kill you as long as I want. Who dares to oppose me?" Josef challenged, waving his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng put the flying blade down and sneered, "If that's the case, I would like to see you try and kill me!"</p>

  <p>Lifting his hands slowly, he poised himself in a fighting position. The disciples of the Drizzle Peak and Skytop Peak took out their weapons, one after another, and stood on each of his sides.</p>

  <p>"Do you dare to fight on Zheng's side? Are you not afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>Surprised, Josef did not expect these people to side with Zheng. He did not anticipate that the elusive man had the group's support.</p>

  <p>In the past, no one in their right mind wanted to be involved in the affairs of the Zhuge Clan. After recognizing that he had sorely overestimated the reputation of his family, his expression shifted into a look of dismay.</p>

  <p>Lenard unsheathed his black and white swords and said, "Everybody says that the wisdom of the Zhuge noble clan is unparalleled.</p>

  <p>So far, why are the members I have met not wise at all, but stupid?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Josef.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you won't encounter any trouble if you kill Zheng. The trick is whether you can really make it happen. Besides, we have so many people here. Are you going to kill all of us? How will you explain that to the Cloud Sect? You are just a counselor. If the Cloud Sect blames the imperial army, do you think that you'd be safe under the protection of Zhuge family?" Lenard shook his head, appearing to be puzzled over Josef's logic.</p>

  <p>When he slowly began to comprehend the man's words, Josef became frustrated. How could he have not thought about that?</p>

  <p>Frankly, he had not expected the unity of the disciples of the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The counselor thought for a while and suddenly asked in a deceitful manner, "Don't you want to escape from White Emperor City? Now that the demons surround the city, it will not be easy for you to leave without getting hurt. I can send some people to escort you! Anyone who wants to leave, come over here! Take my side, and I will provide you a safe passage."</p>

  <p>His beguiling promise gained the interest of several disciples immediately.</p>

  <p>After all, there were thirty-three peaks in the Cloud Sect. The disciples of the other peaks had nothing to do with Zheng. Naturally, they did not want to get involved in the affairs of the Zhuge family. Just then, only Lenard of the Skytop Peak took the lead to stand beside Zheng. Others did not say anything.</p>

  <p>Now that Josef had promised to protect them when they went down from the mountain, they were certainly more attentive than before. After giving his offer some thought, the disciples of the Cloud Sect finally came to a tough decision.</p>

  <p>Slowly, one by one, many of them left their spot and approached the counselor. When no one else made a move, only the disciples of the Skytop Peak, Drizzle Peak, and Lady Peak including Nina were left on Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>After seeing that the number of the people beside Zheng had decreased, Josef smiled again and stated smugly, "Except for Zheng, the rest of you may leave. I dare say, only the fools do not know what to choose!"</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Josef paused, he saw a blinding flash coming from the hand of a female disciple standing behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>The flash converged rapidly to form a dragon-shaped life vitality. Then it shot towards Josef with immense power.</p>

  <p>"Ho!"</p>

  <p>In that very moment, Josef sensed that his life was in peril. The mere thought of losing this way sent chills down his spine, so he willed himself to jump suddenly, and avoided the Shock Dragon.</p>

  <p>The Shock Dragon rushed over all the way, with no signs of stopping, and finally hit a house behind Josef. The entire building did not stand a chance against it and collapsed in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The house crumbled down, and there were smoke and dust all over the ground.</p>

  <p>After his close brush with death, Josef wore a straight face. Even the soldiers he brought with him did not know how to react to the female disciple's attempt.</p>

  <p>Although no one could still see Yale's face clearly, his eyes spoke volumes as they glistened with terror.</p>

  <p>"Shock Dragon? Someone of Zhu Clan!" The furious counselor glared at Nina.</p>
