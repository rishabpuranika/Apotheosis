<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The desperate situation had Zheng thinking long and hard about how to escape.</p>

  <p>There weren't many abilities he could use on the Other Shore. Because of its nature, the Strength God Totem could only increase Zheng's strength— it wasn't nearly enough to force himself out of the tentacles' range.</p>

  <p>The Eye of Will's power was indeed excellent, but for it to be truly effective, it had to be combined with great swordsmanship skills. In this situation, it was practically useless.</p>

  <p>Currently, two tentacles began the third round of cutting.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng gritted his teeth and leaped on full strength. In the little window of opportunity, he managed to evade the tentacles and start running out of the cave.</p>

  <p>But the enclosure was already densely crowded with tentacles. Before he could take any more steps forward, another one hit his legs.</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>The whip-like hit made Zheng lose his balance. Before he fell to the ground, several tentacles wrapped around him, dragging him deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>Their severe grip left him with no chance of escape.</p>

  <p>When someone entered the Other Shore, it was normally difficult for others to tell if their Souls of Light were trapped or injured. The only way to understand one's condition was to examine one's mind.</p>

  <p>But because Zheng entered the Other Shore with his physical body, his case was another story.</p>

  <p>Any injuries he suffered on the Other Shore affected his real body in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is injured! Is he in a fight?"</p>

  <p>"What's happening on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"I hope he's okay…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's body in the Source World sat on the second floor of his courtyard house. His eyes were shut tightly as he cringed like he was in pain. Wounds began appearing on his body abruptly— blood even started gushing out.</p>

  <p>His condition put Yudie and Margaret in a panic. Dorothy rushed to his side and tried to help treat the fresh wounds.</p>

  <p>After sending Feng Ge's body to the Flow Sword Sect, Flamine stayed with them.</p>

  <p>While she couldn't see what was going on at Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, she knew that Feng Ge was in a critical situation— she couldn't just leave protecting Feng Ge up to Zheng alone.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Zheng's terrible wounds, Flamine felt a sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>What about Feng Ge? Was she with him? Was she still safe?</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Flamine was at Feng Ge's side, putting her slender fingers atop the latter's forehead. Closing her eyes in concentration, she examined her daughter's soul— a solemn expression came over her face.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, is she alright?" Dorothy asked in concern.</p>

  <p>"Her soul is very weak. It seems like someone is trying to steal her soul!"</p>

  <p>Now, Flamine sounded angry, gritting her teeth.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Dorothy's eyes widened in alarm. "Is there anything we can do to help her?"</p>

  <p>Margaret and Yudie exchanged looks of astonishment.</p>

  <p>While they had very little knowledge of the Other Shore, they were well aware of the practice of stealing another warrior's soul. But never did they think such a thing could be done on the Other Shore as well.</p>

  <p>"Maybe this creature can even enter the Source World through Feng Ge's body. It might be successful if I hadn't noticed it right away. Now that I've discovered it, I'm not letting it through," Flamine boldly announced as she sneered. She then pressed a hand on her daughter's head and pointed the other to her temple.</p>

  <p>A touch of demonic-red colored her eyes.</p>

  <p>Such was a secret soul skill unique to her— it was highly damaging to her own soul whenever she performed it. But what choice did she have when her daughter was in grave danger?</p>

  <p>Zoom!</p>

  <p>An invisible soul power emanated from her body.</p>

  <p>Violent gusts of wind began blowing from the second floor of the house.</p>

  <p>Her soul power's fluctuation was not necessarily destructive, but all the disciples in the Flow Sword Sect could sense it clearly. Their faces filled with awe as they stared at Zheng's courtyard house from a distance.</p>

  <p>Everyone was well aware that only a dozen people in the entire Oneness Sky Palace were capable of releasing such a terrifying soul aura. They wondered which one of the grandmasters had visited the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, the white shadow went straight into Feng Ge's Memory Flame after entering her Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the pig-faced monsters, Teague had great ambition.</p>

  <p>After he succeeded in becoming a purified being, the entire Stage Thirteen would become his domain— both the black monkeys and the giant ape would be at his mercy.</p>

  <p>Initially, the plan had gone smoothly. Once the flesh and soul were nourished adequately, he was to be reincarnated.</p>

  <p>Never did he think that the fate would send him such a great gift.</p>

  <p>It was a Soul of Light from the Source World.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Other Shore was narrow and limited.</p>

  <p>Creatures like him lurked in the shadows of this narrow world for generations. Dominating the Stage Thirteen didn't do anything to change his fate.</p>

  <p>But if he managed to steal Feng Ge's soul, he'd at least have a chance to return to the Source World. Such was something all the Other Shore creatures longed for.</p>

  <p>With his current abilities, it wouldn't be long before he took control of the chaos in its entirety. At such an exciting thought, Teague did not hesitate for a moment before locking down on his target.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's Memory Flame flickered with a pale-orange light. After she lost her consciousness, the light grew especially dim.</p>

  <p>When Teague finally found her Memory Flame, his ugly mug twisted into a malicious smile.</p>

  <p>Powerful creatures at his level normally had two ways of occupying a soul.</p>

  <p>First, he could destroy her Memory Flame and replace it with his own— with this method, however, he'd lose the original owner's memories.</p>

  <p>Second, he could devour her Memory Flame and integrate her memories into his— this way, he'd obtain all her knowledge and secrets as well.</p>

  <p>Both the Source World and the chaos remained unfamiliar to Teague. He needed to learn about them— what better way than to understand the world through her memories?</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's Memory Flame sensed approaching danger and swayed gently within the depths of her soul like a helpless little girl in the face of a hungry wolf.</p>

  <p>Once her Memory Flame was devoured, her true consciousness would vanish into thin air— something akin to death.</p>

  <p>"I've already found you. Where do you think you can escape?" Teague's soul smiled maliciously as he mocked her. He could almost smell the flame's fragrance.</p>

  <p>The white shadow flashed gently as it grabbed the vulnerable Memory Flame in its hand— it trembled violently and swayed in Teague's palm.</p>

  <p id="top_30">Indeed, there was no way to escape.</p>

  <p>But just as he raised the flame to his mouth, ready to swallow it, something unexpected began unfolding.</p>

  <p>A sudden flash of scarlet-golden flame appeared, proceeded by beams of golden light that started spreading within her soul.</p>

  <p>"Wha-what's going on?!" Teague's eyes were wide as they darted around, wondering what the scene before him was.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he began groaning in pain.</p>

  <p>A burning sensation came over his palm. Before he could react, Feng Ge's Memory Flame began scorching him, forcing him to throw it away.</p>

  <p>Realizing that something was going terribly wrong, he chose to flee.</p>

  <p>Teague was a purified being— he was at the beginning of a new life where a bright future awaited him. He couldn't afford to perish just yet.</p>

  <p>But the golden flames were spreading rapidly, far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the flames had formed a cage around him, making him a prisoner within the depths of Feng Ge's soul.</p>
