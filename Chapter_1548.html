  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This guy's vitality is really something else! If it was someone else, they would've already been slapped into meat paste!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he has some treasure that he's using to protect himself? Ah, but no matter how great that treasure is, he shouldn't be able to block that finger attack!"</p>

  <p>"I think this is the first time Lucille used her Five-element Finger Chain.</p>

  <p>It is a supreme divine weapon ranked the 230th on the Universe Spirit Tablet. It's the Ji Clan's most precious treasure!"</p>

  <p>"This guy still wants to resist? Seriously?"</p>

  <p>There was a lot of commentary from the warriors who watched from the city wall and were clearly enjoying this fight happening right before their very eyes.</p>

  <p>In this world, there were more or less three thousand supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>These weapons, mighty and divine, were mostly controlled by world lords and Supreme Lords. Not many warriors had the luxury of seeing weapons of this caliber up close but they had more or less heard of them.</p>

  <p>Many of those present could clearly tell the origins of the Five-element Finger Chain.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why they were all so hyped-up since this was probably the only time in their lives that they'd be able to see a supreme divine weapon at work.</p>

  <p>"The Five-element Finger Chain was created from a five-colored divine stone. It contains the power of five different Original Laws!" someone graciously supplied just as the giant finger came crashing down.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a loud booming sound as Zheng's fist collided with this giant finger.</p>

  <p>Everyone expected him to be crushed by this attack owing to the sheer discrepancy in proportion of Luo Zheng to this giant finger.</p>

  <p>However, everyone gasped in surprise upon seeing the sight before them.</p>

  <p>There was a gap between the finger and the ground. In between was Luo Zheng who remained standing!</p>

  <p>Once the dust settled, Luo Zheng remained where he stood but there was an evident smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The giant forefinger, condensed from Earth Law, suddenly exploded and scattered by the wind.</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch had actually managed to break through the attack!</p>

  <p>"This… This guy!"</p>

  <p>The audience on top of the city wall was rendered speechless by this scene.</p>

  <p>The same time the finger exploded a wound appeared on Lucille's finger.</p>

  <p>"Ow! It hurts," she frowned as fresh blood spurted from the wound.</p>

  <p>The pain was mostly a piece of cake for any warrior.</p>

  <p>Even someone who had just recently entered the early stage of body refining would not even blink from losing a finger, let alone a small scratch.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille had always been afraid of pain so she couldn't help but gasp when the wound appeared on her finger.</p>

  <p>She put the finger in her mouth and sucked up all the blood in an attempt to soothe the area.</p>

  <p>Even the pale yellow giant that enveloped her also placed its hand on its lips.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly broke free from the giant's grip and sprinted quickly towards Lucille.</p>

  <p>The young girl frowned, "You…"</p>

  <p>Clearly Luo Zheng was much stronger than she had expected.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't strong enough for her to take seriously. Lucille was still confident that he couldn't possibly be strong enough to defeat her.</p>

  <p>As she sucked on her wound, she quickly extended her other hand to slap Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>The gigantic hand obstructed Zheng's advance and his body was constantly rattled about. Each slap left a giant palm print on the ground from the momentous force carried in each attack. He looked like a small boat beaten around by a giant wave with the way he moved back and forth between the palms.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>However, despite the attacks, Luo Zheng was visibly getting closer and closer to Lucille.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When he was about thirty to forty feet away, Luo Zheng stepped through space and rushed towards the giant's foot.</p>

  <p>This giant was a large wall of defense for Lucille. If he wanted to kill her, then he would have to go through this enemy first.</p>

  <p>However, just as he emerged from the space crack, Lucille gently raised her foot and threw a light kick.</p>

  <p>The giant mimicked her actions and aimed the kick towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't expected this so he didn't have any time to dodge. The kick sent him flying back a good distance away.</p>

  <p>This was a welcoming sight for Lucille who pulled her finger out of her mouth once she saw Luo Zheng flying away from her kick. Still, she couldn't be that much bothered with him and diverted her focus to her finger.</p>

  <p>All in all, this kick sent him back for more than ten miles!</p>

  <p>Luckily, before he could slam onto the hard ground, Luo Zheng was able to steady himself and float in the air. He could still see the yellow giant in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Just by using the Earth Law. She really is a tough one…" Luo Zheng remarked sheepishly.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't give up. It wasn't in his nature so he quickly steeled his resolve and went back into the fight head-on!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly rushed back to where he had been, his figure blurring into a streak of light as he shot forward once again.</p>

  <p>The sight of a quickly approaching Luo Zheng irritated Lucille who decided she had enough. It was perhaps finally the time to take this fight seriously since this guy had already proven his strength and resilience to her.</p>

  <p>There was never any worry of losing on Lucille's part. Sure, she felt a bit threatened but she was confident that she would end up having the last laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it another try…" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Once he was close enough, Lucille suddenly reached out with her hand in an attempt to pull Luo Zheng down from the air.</p>

  <p>However, just as she did this, Luo Zheng quickly waved his hand to summon a palm-sized, seven-colored mountain in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Magnetic Sacred Mountain!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>This Magnetic Sacred Mountain had been refined using the secret technique. From a palm-sized mountain, it rapidly grew into a huge landmass enough to effectively crush the yellow giant!</p>

  <p>"This mountain…"</p>

  <p>Lucille murmured in surprise.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't the time to marvel at the sight since the very same mountain was about to crush her.</p>

  <p>Lucille quickly raised her hand in an attempt to shatter through the massive landmass.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The yellow giant punched viciously at the oncoming Magnetic Sacred Mountain in an attempt to prevent itself from getting crushed.</p>

  <p>However, brute force just wasn't going to cut it. This Magnetic Sacred Mountain contained a mix of the five elements which made it extremely reactive to Law Power. It was extremely sturdy and normal attacks were useless against it.</p>

  <p>So despite their best efforts, the mountain continued to press down onto its victims.</p>

  <p>Since it wasn't just any ordinary mountain, it was expected that its weight was also far from ordinary.</p>

  <p>The pressure was tantamount as it fell onto the giant's shoulders.</p>

  <p>Even Lucille, who was within the giant's body, could feel just how heavy the mountain was to the point where she couldn't even move!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Cracks began to appear on the giant's shoulder. The mountain's weight was definitely too much to bear and anyone who had to stand underneath was sure to get crushed.</p>

  <p>There was a faint smile on Zheng's face as he watched this scene. Now that he had his enemy where he wanted, he took this opportunity to finally get close to Lucille.</p>

  <p>He hoped this would be enough to kill her. He just couldn't help but feel excited as he thought about just how many Illusion Points were stored inside her body.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to get near her, Lucille's eyes flashed dangerously. With a flick of a wrist, she quickly dissipated the Earth Law that had condensed the giant from existence.</p>

  <p>Without any more resistance, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain quickly smashed down to the ground!</p>

  <p>Anyone who had the unfortunate fate to be underneath this mountain was doomed.</p>

  <p>However, just as the mountain rushed down towards her, Lucille lightly tapped the ring on her right thumb and pulled out a faint golden wind from it. With a gentle wave, she quickly disappeared from the spot.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain heavily pressed down onto the ground that immediately crumbled underneath its weight. It took a couple of hundred meters before the mountain settled and finally stopped sinking.</p>

  <p>Huff!</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Lucille, who had previously been underneath the mountain, now stood on its peak, courtesy of the golden wind.</p>

  <p>It was extremely windy at the top, owing mostly to the results of their battle.</p>

  <p>Ivory ribbons flapped wildly behind her as the wind harshly whipped past.</p>

  <p>From here, she looked down at Luo Zheng with a strange, unnatural expression.</p>
