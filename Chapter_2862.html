<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zavier arched through the sky in a large circle before dashing towards the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>Hamish and Zavier had completely different characters.</p>

  <p>Hamish had rarely revealed his true strength in the presence of others over the years.</p>

  <p>He had even disguised himself as an old man of True God Realm, hiding anonymously in a small divine city.</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas only knew Hamish as a powerful master of the Other Shore Realm. But then he had had no concept of the power that the Other Shore Realm masters possessed. Hamish had always maintained a low profile.</p>

  <p>Compared to Hamish, Zavier was at the extreme end of the spectrum.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The moment he descended from the sky, he landed powerfully on the solid trunk of the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>The North Star Region had already been reduced to a waste land, and the Lofty Tree had come to resemble a dead tree, though the core was still alive. Without that life-force, it would have been impossible to keep the Mixed Element Seal working.</p>

  <p>It was no mean feat, even for a Holy Being, to break the strong main trunk.</p>

  <p>But as Zavier stomped down on the desiccated trunk, a crack appeared and spread through the surface of the main trunk. It was as if the bole itself would break if he had exerted even a little more strength.</p>

  <p>"What a strong aura!"</p>

  <p>Sensing the aura emitting from Zavier, Samuel was both shocked and awed.</p>

  <p>It was clearly the aura of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had always pursued the Truth of Godly Way. Even if they could only claim an abridged one, they still practiced it tirelessly.</p>

  <p>Samuel had previously seen several different Truths of Godly Ways, but he had never before encountered such a powerful one...</p>

  <p>"You, are excellent..." Zavier patted Samuel's shoulder and said, "You are also good. Better than that scumbag, Nicholas, at least."</p>

  <p>Hearing the reproach of Nicholas, Hamish frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Hamish had been a staunch supporter of Nicholas for many years, so needless to say, he had felt close to Nicholas. Hearing Nicholas's name being tarnished by name-calling so soon after his death left Hamish feeling quite upset.</p>

  <p>However, out of this group of Yellow Emperor Guards, Hamish was the weakest, and he held the lowest rank. It was improper for him to rebuke a superior or volunteer any comments.</p>

  <p>Samuel smiled and said, "Holy Nicholas seemed to be the only one who had attained the consummation of Truth of Godly Way. He stood in the front rank among the Holy Beings. If Holy Nicholas is scum, then surely the rest of us lesser Holy Beings are much worse than that..."</p>

  <p>Hamish could only glance in surprise at Samuel, understanding his intentions behind these words.</p>

  <p>His words sounded quite modest, but in fact, he was telling the Yellow Emperor Guards that he hadn't even attained the complete Truth of Godly Way. He was asking for a reward.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the brave words, Zavier laughed and said, "The Truth of Godly Way that Nicholas mastered is the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, which Leyton had passed on to him. When his seal is removed, you can ask Leyton to pass it to you. That's a minor thing. If you have enough time, you will eventually step into the Sea of Truth. But whether you can successfully cross it... that's hard to say..."</p>

  <p>Hearing this news, Samuel was overjoyed at the opportunity.</p>

  <p>In fact, Samuel was quite clear where Nicholas's Truth of Dark and Light Chaos came from.</p>

  <p>However, what Leyton had given to Nicholas was a special Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>Leyton had taught a special method to Nicholas, which allowed him to channel the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos from the Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>Samuel had seen that Sanskrit word in his probing of Nicholas' memory, but he remained clueless to the meaning of it all. So it was unlikely that he would discern the meaning of Truth of Dark and Light Chaos from this Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>Now, Zavier had easily agreed to his request, but Leyton kept mum. So Samuel seized the chance and cupped his hands towards the Mixed Element Seal, which trapped Leyton and asked, "Master Leyton, would you kindly pass the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos to me?"</p>

  <p>Leyton, who was in the sphere, replied flatly, "As Zavier has said, this is a minor thing."</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes twinkled with hope. He said, "We'd better remove the seal as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, another black light emanated from Pascal's hand...</p>

  <p>Leaving the divine land was proving not to be an easy feat for the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Above the Time Sea, dozens of huge universes were scattered in the sky. It was a very dangerous journey for anyone to rashly barge into the Holy Beings' inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Even if one made a substantial detour to avoid colliding with the universes in the sky, there was still a strong layer of Space Law at the top of the sky to contend with.</p>

  <p>It was a challenge, even for top-rank True Gods, to break through this layer of Space Law?</p>

  <p>Consummate True Gods and Demi-Holy Beings had the ability to break through it, but no one would dare do that.</p>

  <p>Except for the Holy Beings, anyone else who dared to step outside the divine land would die. This was something that all the True Gods knew.</p>

  <p>However, if Holy Beings wanted to leave the divine land, it was comparably quite easy. There were only two steps: enter their universe and leave their universe.</p>

  <p>With the help of Mike, Zheng, and Lorena returned to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Calculated by the time of the Evolutionary Universe, he had already been gone for more than two hundred years. This was not a long time even for Soul Sea Realm warriors. Zheng thought of his friends in the universe.</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on his son's face, Mike smiled and said, "You take me to see those Other Shore Realm masters first. Once we return, I'll take you to travel the universe."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, feeling somewhat more at ease. With a wave of his hand, Mike built a space channel that stretched to the top of the universe.</p>

  <p>The three of them easily reached the top of the universe without any hiccups, and they stood at the Zhengith of the divine land.</p>

  <p>At the summit of this huge plane, they were offered an unobstructed and magnificent vista. The massive distance between created a blurry view, and they didn't see the strong masters of the Other Shore Realm anywhere.</p>

  <p>"That's the way!"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know much about the interior layout of the divine land, but he had previously observed the divine land from every angle.</p>

  <p>After confirming the location of the Evolutionary Universe, it was easy to deduce where Timotheus and Emily were located.</p>

  <p>Mike brought Zheng and Lorena to teleport a few more times before they finally saw a huge vortex rising in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That's the place," Zheng said, narrowing his gaze.</p>

  <p>"What a great power!" When Mike saw the huge whirlpool, his eyes flashed with interest. The power contained in the whirlpool was not within the scope of a Holy Being to create.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>When the three of them used the Grand Teleportation again and stepped out the space channel, a faint voice sounded. "Last time, a reckless guy ran out and was killed. It seems that others haven't learned his lesson yet? Eh, Zheng! What are you doing back here?"</p>

  <p>The man speaking was Leopold.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Ramzi, and the others were slumped down or sitting cross legged, trying to replenish their exhausted strengths. When they heard Leopold's words, they dragged their tired eyes open with interest.</p>

  <p>They quickly noticed Mike and Lorena, who were standing behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even though Mike was a Holy Being, he appeared no different from a consummate True God in their eyes.</p>

  <p>But Lorena was a different matter. They instantly recognized her Blood Body at a glance. They knew without a doubt that this was not something from the divine land.</p>

  <p>They were now confused. Who would be willing to sacrifice themselves and use the Furnace of Dark and Light in order to cultivate this precious body?</p>

  <p>"Zheng, who are these people?" Timotheus asked immediately.</p>

  <p>"This is my father and mother," Zheng said with a broad smile. "They wanted to see you."</p>

  <p>As before, they ignored Zheng's father completely. Instead, they all stared in awe at Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Your mother? Then she must be..." Leopold was the first one to understand who she was.</p>
