  <h2 id="toc_1">Chapter 3528 Leaders Of The Two Major Races</h2>

  <p>Naturally, Abdul didn't want Luo Zheng to be too generous. According to the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, if one gained something on the Other Shore, part of the harvest was to be handed over to the Heavenly Palace's stronghold as a reserve, after all.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng cast a cold glare at Abdul and sneered, "The Land of Sword Grief? I wonder what its disciples were doing when the Ghost Scorpion came."</p>

  <p>There was no denying it?the warriors of the Land of Sword Grief were mostly cowards, hiding in the Source World, never daring to even enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"While all of you went into hiding, the Ear Mouse race tried to persuade the Ghost Scorpion not to make a move against me. Once I killed him, it was the Ear Mice, once again, that took the initiative to head underground. Don't you think it's only reasonable to share the harvest with them?" Luo Zheng sharply asked in return.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were filled with gratitude upon hearing Luo Zheng's defense.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't manage to stop the Ghost Scorpion, Luo Zheng was clearly grateful for their effort.</p>

  <p>It was all Abdul could do to clench his jaw and grit his teeth. "Well? speaking of which, Princess Feng Ge has also offered her help. She's a member of our Heavenly Palace, so?"</p>

  <p>As the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Feng Ge had a share of responsibilities in such matters.</p>

  <p>But she blatantly ignored Abdul's insistence.</p>

  <p>After taking her time to bite into a berry and savor the fruit, she looked indifferent as she said, "All the credit goes to Luo Zheng. I didn't do anything."</p>

  <p>Out of excuses, Abdul finally retreated and bowed his head.</p>

  <p>On the other side, the Ear Mouse race handled the matters in the underground world of the northern part of the city. Just as they finished up, two other creatures, one tall and one short, entered the hall. The tall one happened to be the leader of the Giants, Raul, while the short one, Clyde, led the Guide Weasel race.</p>

  <p>This time, it was under the order of these two leaders that the two major races joined hands and destroyed the Dark Bear race.</p>

  <p>Not only had they dealt with members of the Dark Bear race in the City Guard House, but the entire base of the race in the south was also completely wiped out.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, the Dark Bear race was inferior to the long-standing Giant race and Guide Weasel race. It was the head of the Dark Bear race that had managed to make rapid progress as an individual, suppressing the two older races and taking control of the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>As the two leaders gave their introductions politely, Abdul hid his shock. Even the leaders of the major races of the Myriad Spirits City were greatly respectful to Luo Zheng?what the latter had said should be true, Abdul thought.</p>

  <p>"Masters, what can | do for you?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Squeak! "I've joined hands with the Giants to gather all the treasures the Dark Bear race has managed to gather over the years. We'd like to offer this to you as tribute. I hope you'll find it satisfying," said Clyde, throwing a wink to one of his men.</p>

  <p>The latter pulled out a list and handed it to Luo Zheng respectfully.</p>

  <p>After giving the list a quick glance, Luo Zheng handed it to Feng Ge. The amount of wealth and treasure they had gained from occupying the Myriad Spirits City was truly beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>"Sir, may | know whether you'll settle down in the Myriad Spirits City or if you'll be leaving Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore after improving your cultivation?" Clyde asked clearly and carefully.</p>

  <p>That was what he and Raul had come for, after all.</p>

  <p>Even if the City Guard House served as the Taiyi Heaven Palace's stronghold, it had no bearing on the creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>What mattered most to the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race was whether or not they could control the Myriad Spimnts City.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng wasn't from the Other Shore and was soon to leave Stage Fourteen, the chance to take control of the Myriad Spirits City seemed to be within reach more than ever.</p>

  <p>"Staying in the Myriad Spirits City?" After a moment of thought, Luo Zheng nodded. "Now that sounds like a good idea."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Clyde and Raul exchanged a look, a bitter expression coming over them.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really intended to take control of the Myriad Spirits City, it wouldn't end up well for them.</p>

  <p>They would have to handle Luo Zheng instead of the Dark Bear race.</p>

  <p>Seeing the leaders' faces, Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "But we are not creatures from the Other Shore, anyway. Only by improving our cultivation level can we get what we really want. It's impossible for us to stay here forever. Taking care of this city isn't something I'm particularly good at.</p>

  <p>If you're willing to do me the favor, I'll be truly grateful."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Clyde's and Raul's eyes flashed, their frowns turning into smiles. Clyde even clasped his hands together like a human and said,</p>

  <p>"If that's what you want, the Guide Weasel race will be at your service!"</p>

  <p>Many benefits came along with managing a large city, and they were all aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>But it was unrealistic to leave Luo Zheng or the Land of Sword Grief disciples in charge of the entire city?it was the best strategy for the two major races to assist Luo Zheng in management.</p>

  <p>Breaking his silence, Raul suddenly chimed in softly, "As far as I know, the Dark Bear race has an inexorable connection with the Star Falcon race from the Sky Water City. Now that we've cleared out the Dark</p>

  <p>Bear race, I'm afraid the Star Falcon race will come to challenge us. I wonder if you have any idea how to deal with it, Sir?"</p>

  <p>The Dark Bear race was, in fact, established with the Star Falcon race's help. Both the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were well aware of it.</p>

  <p>Now that the Dark Bear race had been wiped out, the stronger Star Falcon race was likely to seek revenge. If they went straight for the Myriad Spirits City when Luo Zheng and his team had already withdrawn from the Other Shore, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race would be in deep trouble, left alone in battle,</p>

  <p>Hearing the news, Luo Zheng looked at the Ear Mouse race with inquisitive eyes.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng could probably figure out the relationship between the races himself, he knew that the information from the Ear Mouse race was probably the most reliable when it came to a secret alliance like this.</p>

  <p>Squeak! "The Ghost Scorpion took action against you because the Star Falcon race gave the order in secret. But after the Ghost Scorpion's death, they asked the Dark Bear race to take action right away," explained an Ear Mouse. "The Star Falcon has a very good relationship with the Jin Wu. The four strong races?the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Jin Wu, and the New Moon race, are all settled in the Sky Water City, the Star Falcon's base!"</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Zheng nodded as something cold seeped into his eyes. "I must go to the Sky Water City to have a look. But if the Star Falcon race dares to come, it would be for the best. Please rest assured, Masters, before | leave Stage Fourteen, | will wipe out the entire Star Falcon race."</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng entered the Desire World, the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, and the other races fought hard to suppress him?he wasn't going to let them off so easily.</p>

  <p>"If you head for the Sky Water City, you can be sure that the Guide Weasel race will help you as much as we can!"</p>

  <p>"The Giant race would all be at your service as well!"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng attacked the Sky Water City and took control of it, both races would benefit greatly.</p>

  <p>Over the next few days, the resources left by the Dark Bear race and the Ghost Scorpion were continuously sent to the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>Abdul wanted to help Luo Zheng put them away because he believed he was responsible for all the resources in the Land of Sword Grief on Stage Fourteen. But Luo Zheng readily refused him, handing the important task to Chaim instead.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the depth of the Phoenix Palace?</p>

  <p>Lady Concubine Yan was resting by the side of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, in front of whom a soul jade slip was floating.</p>

  <p>Once he read the information on the slip, he felt torn between laughing and crying.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty? what is recorded on the soul jade slip? Why are you so upset?" asked Lady Concubine Yan curiously.</p>

  <p>Taking the slip from the air and handing it to her, the emperor smiled, "Have a look for yourself. You'll know why."</p>

  <p>Furrowing her brows, Concubine Yan examined the slip and began immersing herself in the information written on it.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Concubine Yan's eyes lit up. She smiled helplessly, just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi did. "So, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge managed to occupy the Myriad Spirits City so easily?"</p>
