<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though the Source World looked close to them, it would still take a total of three days before finding the Source World's entrance, despite their fastest speed.</p>

  <p>Two Trumpet Flying Ships soared through the air like lightening, one chasing very closely behind the other.</p>

  <p>On the Trumpet Flying Ship behind the one where Zheng and the others were, twelve people stood, all of whom were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man stood at the front of the Trumpet Flying Ship. He looked confident, his arms crossed.</p>

  <p>The man's face was stiff, and his eyebrows resembled two black blades.</p>

  <p>He was wearing black armor from head to toe, on which the complicated veiny lines of blood were flowing. The aura emitted by the armor was very dark and depressing.</p>

  <p>"To the Yellow Emperor Guards on the Trumpet Flying Ship before us, tell me your names!" the man said in a loud and clear voice as he held a Yellow Emperor Magatama in his hand. He was trying to communicate with the people on the Trumpet Flying Ship in front of him.</p>

  <p>Despite his attempts at communication, no reply came from the group.</p>

  <p>Everyone remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Master Telmo, that Trumpet Flying Ship appears very strange to me. Why do you think they ran as soon as they saw us?" asked a short man standing beside the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>When it came to the Yellow Emperor Guards, anyone who was capable of riding a Trumpet Flying Ship was considered having a high status.</p>

  <p>If ever they were to meet in the chaos, they would exchange their names and inform each other of useful information, as per usual.</p>

  <p>When Telmo ordered his men to meet up with the second Trumpet Flying Ship, none of his warriors expected the ship to speed up at their presence and flee.</p>

  <p>Everyone had the same thought on their mind: something had to be wrong with the ship.</p>

  <p>Without speaking a single word, Telmo ordered his men to chase after the Trumpet Flying Ship while trying to communicate with them through the Yellow Emperor Magatama. However, the opposing party refused to respond to them, from start to finish.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that someone has hijacked the Trumpet Flying Ship?"</p>

  <p>"Hmm...who would dare commit such an act?!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But why else would they be fleeing?"</p>

  <p>Just as the Yellow Emperor Guards continued to discuss, Telmo stared at the Trumpet Flying Ship in front of him and said, "No matter what the situation is, we will definitely investigate it further." As they conversed, they noticed a sudden streak of light flash across the Trumpet Flying Ship in front of them. In the blink of an eye, the entire Trumpet Flying Ship vanished right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>"They have entered the space channel. Let's follow them! Hurry up!" Telmo ordered his men loudly with a frown.</p>

  <p>One of the warriors controlling the Trumpet Flying Ship nodded his head in agreement and commanded the ship to fly into the space channel as well.</p>

  <p>Both Trumpet Flying Ships were near equals when it came to performance.</p>

  <p>The one in the front simply couldn't get the one in the back off its tail.</p>

  <p>"What if we just can't get rid of it?"</p>

  <p>Leopold placed another divine crystal into the jade plate. The Trumpet Flying Ship's speed had already been pushed to the maximum, but in spite of his efforts, the other Trumpet Flying Ship still followed them close behind. More importantly, it too, had entered the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Since the opponents are the Yellow Emperor Guards, they must have the Yellow Emperor Magatama. Although they can't catch up with us this way, they can use the Yellow Emperor Magatama to call for others to block us."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked back at the ship following them not far off in the distance and furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>Emily blinked furiously and a murderous look flashed in her eyes. With a deep breath out, she said, "In that case, Leopold, slow down."</p>

  <p>"What? Slow down?!" Leopold looked at Emily in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is right. If they inform other Yellow Emperor Guards about what's going on, I'm afraid that we won't be able to escape," Emily said carefully.</p>

  <p>"So let's face it. We may as well counterattack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng subconsciously nodded his head and said, "I agree with you."</p>

  <p>Emily looked over at Yan and said, "If we fight against them, there will be risk. Yan, come into my inner world and hide from them for the time being.</p>

  <p>You'll be safe."</p>

  <p>Yan bit her lips and glanced at her brother. Zheng also persuaded her gently,</p>

  <p>"Yan, be obedient. After we get through this disaster, you'll obviously be released. There's no need to worry."</p>

  <p>A ray of soft light slowly swirled in Yan's eyes as she looked at Zheng with affection.</p>

  <p>Although her brother had guaranteed her eventual release, she had a vague premonition in her mind that seeing Zheng again wouldn't be that easy.</p>

  <p>Due to such a premonition, Yan was particularly reluctant to leave, of course. She walked up to Zheng, even kissed his forehead, and then slowly turned her attention to Emily.</p>

  <p>Once Emily had safely placed Yan inside her inner world, she looked at Leopold and said, "Slow down! Get ready to activate the Slaughtering Moonlight Array."</p>

  <p>The Slaughtering Moonlight Array was a remarkable killing weapon. Emily had practiced it many times before, back in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating in the least, Leopold threw multiple divine crystals into the jade plate, one after the other.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the divine land, they had located a massive amount of divine crystals. Zheng had taken half of them. Before they had decided to return to the Source World, he had handed two thousand divine crystals to Leopold, and only sixty to seventy divine crystals had been consumed along the way. Now, there were still plenty of divine crystals to activate the Slaughtering Moonlight Array.</p>

  <p>As they worked together to activate their weapon, the people on the other Trumpet Flying Ship observed them closely, watching their every action.</p>

  <p>"Master Telmo, look, they've slowed down!" a Yellow Emperor Guard reported, an urgency in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm not blind," Telmo replied in an annoyed tone.</p>

  <p>The sudden decline of the other Trumpet Flying Ship's speed was so obvious that it alerted Telmo, too.</p>

  <p>Telmo hadn't treated the other party as their enemy, not yet at least. Perhaps the Yellow Emperor Guards on the Trumpet Flying Ship had something urgent to deal with. He was open to all possibilities. However, even if they had something urgent to deal with, there simply wasn't any reason for them not to respond to Telmo's call through the Yellow Emperor Magatama. The other party only needed to use their own Yellow Emperor Magatama to explain the situation.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed so strange and no one was capable of fully understanding what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Seeing as they've finally slowed down, let's take our chance in approaching them. Everyone, be prepared. I'm afraid we must not consider them our friends," Telmo ordered.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors all obeyed Telmo's order immediately and activated the Other Shore Tokens within their bodies, in an attempt to get ready for the upcoming battle.</p>

  <p>Within the spatial passageway, the distance between the two Trumpet Flying Ships finally began to close.</p>

  <p>Three thousand miles...</p>

  <p>Five hundred miles...</p>

  <p>A hundred miles...</p>

  <p>Fifty miles...</p>

  <p>Without anything standing in their way now, Telmo could see the people's faces on the Trumpet Flying Ship in front of them. Out of nowhere, Emily's pretty face came into view.</p>

  <p>"Huh? A woman?" Telmo's eyes flashed brightly as he tried searching for information about this individual in his mind.</p>

  <p>A warrior capable of commanding a Trumpet Flying Ship was at least a five-star Yellow Emperor Guard. However, as far as he knew, Emily wasn't one of the five-star Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>'Could she be from the Sky Guard Pavilion?' Telmo wondered silently.</p>

  <p>As this thought crossed his mind, a chill shuddered through his heart. If the woman really was from the Sky Guard Pavilion, then she was qualified to ignore him.</p>

  <p>However, out of duty, Telmo would continue performing a regular check up on the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>Thirty miles...</p>

  <p>Twenty miles...</p>

  <p>Only ten miles...</p>

  <p>The remaining distance was quite small. Covering this distance for an Other Shore Realm warrior was as simple as pie.</p>

  <p>Emily stood on the ship's rail with her legs and heels pressed tightly together. Her white robe embroidered with white chrysanthemum fluttered in the wind graciously.</p>

  <p>Telmo could see her quite clearly now, and he knew she could see him as well.</p>

  <p>As the two of them looked at each other, a strange smile suddenly spread across Emily's lips. "Activate it now," she said to Leopold indifferently.</p>

  <p>Leopold flipped the jade plate in his hand gently, and a high number of crescents immediately spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Slaughtering Moonlight Array covered a hundred miles around. Emily gently waved her hand and lightly cut toward the Trumpet Flying Ship behind them. It looked so easy and simple for her, as though she were lifting a feather.</p>

  <p>At the sight of silver crescents, Telmo's face filled with fear.</p>

  <p>"Watch out! It's the Slaughtering Moonlight Array! Run!" he screamed in terror.</p>
