<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2260 Concentrating On Cultivation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen Mu Ning yield the Gods Killing Sword Array before. He knew that its power was truly formidable.</p>

  <p>Back then, Mu Ning was only a world lord, yet with the Gods Killing Sword Array, she had defeated many Supreme Lords. It was well known that at least five Supreme Lords had been killed at the hand of this skill.</p>

  <p>The four swords that Mu Ning used were created by the divine textures of the Celestial Position race, greatly reducing their power.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng truly mastered the Four Swords Change of the Gods Killing Sword Array to the point of using it well, his strength would improve remarkably.</p>

  <p>As soon as Joy finished speaking, countless invisible swords began swarming around in a purple mist, merging into four distinct swords.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only just make out their shapes.</p>

  <p>Vines weaved around one of the swords, their irregular curves twisting around the blade. Luo Zheng recognized it as the Long Vine Sword.</p>

  <p>The second sword's hilt was fashioned into a sitting Buddha, with its blade as wide as a wheel— the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>The next sword had many layers much like a pagoda, the Grant Sun Sword.</p>

  <p>The last sword was filled with sharp spines, making up the distinct look of the Heavenly Tooth Sword.</p>

  <p>"Use your Power Shaping and create the same four swords," ordered Joy.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng asked. "Do the shapes of the swords truly matter that much?" Was it truly necessary that the Gods Killing Sword Array was made up of the same four swords? With his Power Shaping, he was capable of creating swords into so many other various shapes.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!" Joy snapped. As a Demi-holy Being, she was being more generous by teaching Luo Zheng the skills she had acquired and yet he was incredulous enough to question her.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Zheng finally nodded obediently. Without another word, he summoned the strength of the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't actually mastered the true Power Shaping skill. With only the power of the Eight Path Platforms, it would've been impossible, but by using the Cross-world Theurgy, he realized that he could still shape things to his will. That meant he was effectively bypassing the second stage of Power Shaping and going straight to the third stage.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The power of the Cross-world Theurgy came rushing through him, transforming into the swords' very shapes.</p>

  <p>First that started coming into form was… The Long Vine Sword.</p>

  <p>Keeping the shape of Joy's sword in his mind, soon, Luo Zheng made an identical Long Vine Sword appear in front of him, only a tad smaller in size. It turned out to be a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>"Okay! The second sword!"</p>

  <p>When he began shaping the second sword, the Long Vine Sword suddenly trembled until it immediately dissipated.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Luo Zheng scratched his head in confusion and embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Joy merely sneered and asked, "Didn't you understand the internal momentum of the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique? Don't you already know of the Separate Controlling skill?"</p>

  <p>But what she didn't know was that Luo Zheng himself wasn't grasping the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique— it was the Infinity Ruler in his brain that did it.</p>

  <p>The two most prominent skills of the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique included shaping and controlling things. Mu Ning had a first-rank Purple Power Body, born with a strong controlling ability, allowing her to order millions of huge swords simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Still, it was much easier to order those huge swords than Zheng's current task. He needed to maintain the shape of the Long Vine Sword while shaping the second sword. Without grasping the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way, it was an arduous task for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After Joy's guidance, a purple light flashed upon a small scale of the Infinity Ruler in his brain. At the same time, a purple light flashed in his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way…</p>

  <p>While he was still meditating, Luo Zheng shaped the Long Vine Sword once again. And with a gentle wave of his hand, he began carefully extracting the strength source.</p>

  <p>"The second sword!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It was the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>This time, he managed to shape the second sword.</p>

  <p>But he didn't remain complacent about it. With determination filling his eyes, he seized the moment and went further.</p>

  <p>"The third sword..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>While maintaining the first two swords, he managed to shape the third one successfully.</p>

  <p>But that lasted barely over a second before the three swords dispersed all at once.</p>

  <p>"No good. Try again!" Joy snorted at him.</p>

  <p>Contempt was evident on her face, but that was to disguise the deep shock in her heart.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Mike's son was a truly gifted warrior!</p>

  <p>When she had only just become a Demi-holy Being and mastered the Cross-world Theurgy, she thought about how to transform the Gods Killing Sword Array. According to Mike's guidance, she had tried to create the four swords through Power Shaping, just as Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>Back then, it had taken her a full month before managing to maintain the two swords simultaneously, and another half-year to maintain three whole swords.</p>

  <p>For mortals, half a year was a long period. But for Joy and the other True Gods, it was nothing more than the blink of an eye, and she had been quite satisfied with her quick progress.</p>

  <p>But now...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only tried to do it twice and yet he managed to shape three swords all at once.</p>

  <p>The sight, without a doubt, hurt Joy's self-confidence. She couldn't help but wonder whether she was inadequate or if Luo Zheng was just too talented.</p>

  <p>"Okay, okay. I'll try it again. I've just begun to cultivate this skill. Why must you be so harsh?" Luo Zheng mumbled complaints, feeling that Joy was all too strict with him.</p>

  <p>"What are you muttering to yourself?" Joy asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>To that, Luo Zheng only curled his lips and didn't dare complain any more.</p>

  <p>Instead, he continued to extract strength source for Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>During the third attempt, Luo Zheng managed to maintain three swords for nine whole seconds before they broke down.</p>

  <p>At the fourth attempt, the process successfully lasted for a full minute.</p>

  <p>At the fifth attempt, two minutes and a half.</p>

  <p>At the sixth attempt, five minutes.</p>

  <p>By his seventh attempt, he was able to maintain three swords for a remarkably long time.</p>

  <p>"How is it now? Still bad?" Luo Zheng asked with a smile, catching his breath.</p>

  <p>"Not bad," Joy replied, calmly this time. Mixed feelings surged into her heart as she began doubting her talent again.</p>

  <p>'He resembles his father so much, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>In the past, when she had a crush on Mike and accompanied him on his cultivation in the Evolutionary Universe, she was astonished by Mike's outstanding talent and understanding ability over and over again. But thanks to his strict guidance, she managed to improve rather quickly.</p>

  <p>Back then, she realized that she was probably unlikely to ever surpass this man in her whole life. But since Mike was already a Holy Being at that time, along with the fact that she admired and adored him, it didn't depress her so much that she was inferior to him. Instead, she could accept it as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>But here before her was his son, a mere proving godly warrior, showing the same astonishing talent. Depression and jealousy filled her heart.</p>

  <p>Even if she was already a Demi-holy Being, she couldn't quite handle the frustration.</p>

  <p>"Since you can maintain three swords now, you should be able to shape the fourth sword," she ordered. "I've already slowed down the time flow rate in the Purple Sky Land. You can continue cultivating here."</p>

  <p>But time was still too limited for him. There were only two months before the new ranking of the Floating Islands was to be established. If he wasted a few months in the Purple Sky Land before the new ranking was established, the Purple Soul Hall would probably have no choice but to dismiss 80% of its disciples.</p>

  <p>Naturally, forming four swords was miles harder than only three. It was no surprise that he failed to do so on his first try.</p>

  <p>But there was no change in his expression— he didn't even blink. He only continued to patiently stimulate his strength source again.</p>

  <p>Staring at him from behind, Joy remained silent, her eyes turning glassy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked very much like Mike when he was focused on practicing the martial arts. She couldn't help but fall back into memories. She recalled the old days when she was practicing in the Purple Power World. In order to help her cultivate, Mike asked her to take a moment and close her eyes. When she opened them again, she saw the Purple Power World become a fairyland— a world of huge swords.</p>

  <p>99.9 billion huge swords were densely packed in the sky of the Purple Power World. Controlling the swords at her will had her truly overjoyed.</p>

  <p>After ten full days, Luo Zheng finally managed to maintain four swords for three seconds.</p>

  <p>It was something Joy managed only after six months of practice.</p>

  <p>Merely two months had passed in the Purple Sky Land and Luo Zheng was able to maintain four swords for fifteen seconds.</p>

  <p>Half a year later, he could keep them up for a long period.</p>

  <p>During these six months, Luo Zheng seemed to have no other thoughts except for concentrating on shaping the swords. After they dissipated, he repeated the boring process over and over.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Joy had already changed the time flow rate so that half a year in the Purple Sky Land was only three days in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Since he could maintain four swords at the same time now, Joy began teaching him the operation method of the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>
