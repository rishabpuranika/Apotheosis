  <p>Just as Connie's siren reverberated throughout the air, numerous beams of light from all over the Ultimate Immortal City shot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>The black light's and white light's auras were the most powerful among the light beams. The thick waves of smoke billowed like the wind as they surged and soared into the sky with a grand Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a loud voice shouted, "Who dares to break into the Ultimate Immortal City?!" A burly figure dressed in black armors appeared within the blurry black light. He had a fiendish look to his face, like a tiger ready to pounce at any given rate.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's a little mouse that's lost," answered back a voice within the white light, where a skinny young man in flirtatious clothes stood. He had three wolf teeth birthmarks on his face, and he was even more beautiful than a woman.</p>

  <p>It was known that only women in all of the Sacred race were born with wolf teeth birthmarks, so this young man had imprinted them onto himself.</p>

  <p>The black figure and the white figure were the Sacred race's two grand world lords who guarded the Ultimate Immortal City. In addition, they were quite well-known in the Murphy Universe. The black one was called Raleign, and the white was Leacock.</p>

  <p>"Ha, I'd like to see how skilled this little mouse is," Raleign sneered then shot towards the south side of the city. A long, black smoke like a brush stroke left an inky black trail in the sky in his wake.</p>

  <p>Leacock faintly smiled and went on to disappear as well. Although the Ultimate Immortal City was a vast piece of territory, it only seemed like a courtyard to the world lords--such that they could travel the entire city in just a few steps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other world lords exchanged looks and shot towards the south side of the city as well.</p>

  <p>Even though Connie's warning screamed the deadliest news and hinted that a strong enemy was here, these world lords didn't look so bothered.</p>

  <p>It was because looking at the battle from all perspectives, it could be said that a human Supreme Lord would have to risk dying if they wanted to break the Blood Curse Array. Such a hazardous action was definitely not worth risking for a place that wasn't as important, like the Seven Ultimate World.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there was nothing to be afraid of a world lord who sneaked into the Ultimate Immortal City since the city had two grand world lords. One human world lord alone wanted to destroy the Blood Curse Array? That was childish.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, the world lords appeared above the blood pool at the south of the city.</p>

  <p>Before all of those had happened, Luo Luo Zheng had already accumulated a portion of his power in front of his fist. The power extracted from the nine stars was already condensed to the limit, and had lesser impact on the surrounding environment.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't see the shocking scene that Connie had witnessed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng threw a single punch towards the enchanted barrier and ignored the sudden appearance of the world lords.</p>

  <p>"As I expected, a human world lord. Interesting. You're quite the courageous one," Raleign said with a faint smile as he sized Luo Luo Zheng up.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. Using brute force to break the Four Images Time Barrier? This guy is really imaginative," Leacock agreed with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier that covered the four blood pools was known as the Four Images Time Barrier. The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were required to personally set the enchanted barrier's mysteries, so that it could protect the four blood pools from damage. Because the four enchanted barriers were connected as one, and shared the attacks imposed on them together, it was nearly impossible to break the Four Images Time Barrier with brute force.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all of the Sacred race's world lords present were fully confident in this enchanted barrier's power.</p>

  <p>It was also why the two grand world lords didn't want to stop Luo Luo Zheng. They simply wanted to see how this ignorant human world lord who didn't know his limits would be able to break the Four Images Time Barrier.</p>

  <p>Since the two grand world lords themselves hadn't acted yet, the other Sacred world lords naturally wouldn't act either.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and stop him!" Connie warned.</p>

  <p>She honestly hoped that with her warning, Leacock and Raleign would stop Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had just witnessed how devastating Luo Zheng's power was. To what level did his power achieve that it had distorted the surrounding space by force?</p>

  <p>Raleign and the others looked at Connie in the blood pool with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Although Connie had just become a world lord and her cultivation wasn't that stable yet, she still had an exalted status. She was also one of the Godly Geniuses of the Murphy Universe and was not less powerful than an ordinary world lord, if not better. Why was she so anxious then?</p>

  <p>However, Leacock had seen that something was wrong and guessed that the brat in front of them must be really special. But it was too late to stop him now!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch had already come into contact with the edge of the Four Images Time Barrier.</p>

  <p>The power extracted from the nine stars was immensely strong. Once it gushed out, it was like an unstoppable torrent of energy had washed over the Four Images Time Barrier.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Murphy Universe all thought that the Four Images Time Barrier couldn't be broken with brute force. Such a notion had long been the belief of the people of the Sacred race because they had never seen anyone, not even a Supreme Lord, break it with brute force.</p>

  <p>It could be said that a Supreme Lord who carried the Heavenly Destiny was the incarnation of the rules. If even a Supreme Lord couldn't break the enchanted barrier, then such was the rule.</p>

  <p>However, the Four Images Time Barrier was not completely immune to power, and it wasn't completely impossible to break it with brute force. If one used a power that could surpass the limits of the Four Images Time Barrier, then it would be broken.</p>

  <p>The sharp, ear-splitting sound lasted for three seconds.</p>

  <p>When Leacock, Raleign, and the others heard it, they immediately felt that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>When they had been previously full of confidence, now they started to worry. Could this human boy really shatter the Four Images Time Barrier with a single punch? They all felt anxious on the inside, but their subconscious still held on to the thought that such a thing was unlikely.</p>

  <p>Yet, not everything went according to one's wishes.</p>

  <p>The sharp sound became increasingly shrill and unbearable. Then, slight explosions followed. The small explosions accumulated repeatedly until they ultimately erupted into one intense explosion.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>In the speed of light, everyone saw Luo Zheng's arm pierce through the Four Images Time Barrier!</p>

  <p>Something just as bad happened at the same time?</p>

  <p>The enchanted barriers above the other three blood pools in the Ultimate Immortal City were also instantly destroyed.</p>

  <p>The four enchanted barriers were connected and withstood damage together. While it indeed greatly increased the barrier's strength, it also posed an incredible disadvantage: once one of the barriers was destroyed, the others would be destroyed as well. It was the price to pay since the barrier was a single entity.</p>

  <p>Raleign was in a daze as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng who was in the middle of the blood pool. Meanwhile, Leacock and the others stood dumbfounded as well.</p>

  <p>Connie was the only one who wore a frown. Based on Luo Zheng's earlier display of strength, this scene would obviously happen.</p>

  <p>"He wants to destroy the array!"</p>

  <p>"Stop him! Now!"</p>

  <p>The other world lords were in a state of panic. It wasn't easy to set up the Blood Curse Array. If it was broken, the leaders of the Sacred race would clearly punish them.</p>

  <p>Aside from Connie, the other world lords had to take responsibility for the destruction. Not even one of them could escape.</p>

  <p>However, they were still quite a distance away from the blood pool. How could they easily stop Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>The two grand world lords reacted quickly and moved in a flash, but after Luo Luo Zheng had broken the Four Images Time Barrier, he had already rushed upwards and had turned into a cone which drilled into the insides of the Blood Curse Array.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an invisible ring of light spread out under Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng who was now in the array and had left behind the ring of light, broke into a strange smile and took a step forward. The light of the Space Law scattered under his feet as he used the Grand Teleportation and disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>The world lords who charged forward were stunned again.</p>

  <p>What did the human world lord want? Even after Luo Luo Zheng had expended so much effort and finally broke the Four Images Time Barrier, he had actually managed to escape without destroying the Blood Curse Array.</p>

  <p>The crowd was confused.</p>

  <p>The reason they guarded this place in the first place was to protect the array, so that the Blood Curse Technique could be cast smoothly. They couldn't afford to lose those divine textures in the Ultimate Immortal City. They would all be killed if the divine textures were destroyed.</p>

  <p>While the world lords were indeed puzzled, they also felt slightly relieved. It was as if they were faced with a madman.</p>

  <p>But after a few seconds, they finally understood. This fellow was no lunatic at all.</p>

  <p>Rhombic fragments began to form in the sky, which constantly gathered together. The sky was then filled with numerous bolts of thunder. The Heavenly Tribulation was about to arrive.</p>
