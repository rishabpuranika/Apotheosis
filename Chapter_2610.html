  <p>
</p>

  <p>After bringing Zelda and Luther to the Snake Goddess race, Zheng had completed his mission. He felt relieved that he was able to get it done without any issues.</p>

  <p>Whether or not he could leave this world and return to the divine land would be decided after the Light of Adjudication came. For now, the Snake Goddess race would be responsible for increasing Luther's cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Since his work was done, Zheng had to return to the Sky Spirit Bone Tower to cultivate in seclusion. He needed to improve on a lot of things and prepare while he had time.</p>

  <p>He could imagine that it wouldn't be easy for him to leave this world. He had to go through a fierce battle with the Warden race and survive.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after returning to the divine land, he would be required to face those Holy Beings too. Therefore, he had to improve his cultivation urgently. Zheng took a deep breath as he thought how busy he would be from now on.</p>

  <p>Since the Nine Li race and the Snake Goddess race had joined hands, the Nine Li race started to have a more active atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Although the Wild Gods who were born and raised in this world were not urgent to leave, they were yearning for the further and larger Source World. With the help and leadership of the exiles, almost all the members of the Nine Li race sped up their cultivation.</p>

  <p>The colorful waves in the Time Sea rolled and foamed, with countless fragments rolling within.</p>

  <p>White clouds flew above the water, and from a very special angle, the light bounced off the Time Sea, reflecting colors against these clouds.</p>

  <p>The waves sparkled a prism of colors as light struck its surface. Deep in the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, a towering structure could be noticed.</p>

  <p>The pale golden palace stood in the middle of the island.</p>

  <p>By the looks of it, one could tell that the structure had only been recently built. Although it only covered a small area, it appeared particularly exquisite.</p>

  <p>Seeing its magnificent craftsmanship, any master in weapon refining would probably be amazed.</p>

  <p>A special kind of gold, usually used to make the top-grade weapons, was used to build this palace. A layer of emerald green rhomboid jades decorated its surface. It was believed that this kind of jade was able to attract the vitality between heaven and earth by nature. For the same reason, some True Gods liked to make beads with these jades and placed them in their houses, hoping they could continuously attract the vitality hundreds of miles around them.</p>

  <p>Being completely wrapped with such jades, the palace appeared so luxurious.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful clans on the Floating Islands would not waste the jades by using them as elaborate decorations for their homes.</p>

  <p>In the center of the palace was a metal box. A brown liquid boiled on the top of the box, though no heat came from it.</p>

  <p>As seen from afar, a burly figure appeared at the main entrance of the palace. It was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>He was known as the ruler of this land, holding the highest post in the eyes of the Dongfang Clan and even in front of the Holy Beings from various powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The expression in his eyes was enough to cause fear on countless people.</p>

  <p>Of course, he could also kill countless people with just a glance.</p>

  <p>But every time he stepped into this palace, darkness took over his handsome face.</p>

  <p>Slowly walking towards the glazed box, Nicholas reached out to stroke the box gently. The patterns on the surface of the box began to flash with a faint glow under his touch, brown liquid boiling more violently every second.</p>

  <p>Soon, a mass of silk like hair came out of the liquid. Having its own consciousness, the hair slowly twisted and wound in all directions.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a head slowly floated up from the box.</p>

  <p>It had an unparalleled face. The pretty face had her eyes closed and remained motionless.</p>

  <p>Seeing this face, the malicious and insidious expression on Nicholas' face disappeared completely. Love filled his eyes as he stared at it.</p>

  <p>If anyone saw his expression, they would surely sigh in their heart. After all, such a hero had never shown his love in front of others. He was always seen as a tough personality.</p>

  <p>"Lorena..."</p>

  <p>Nicholas called softly.</p>

  <p>The head dismissed his call. Her eyes remained closed as if she hadn't heard Nicholas at all.</p>

  <p>"If you don't like the body I made for you, I will try to find your body back," Nicholas said in a thoughtful tone.</p>

  <p>During this period, he had tried every means to help Lorena find the perfect body she could use.</p>

  <p>Being a powerful being, it was easy for him to get all the rare items in the world.</p>

  <p>So far, someone from the North Sea offered a pure feminine body, and someone from a little known Sky Region presented a phoenix's body.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Nicholas had also gotten a blood condensation puppet…</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't use them for her body, they could be used to make the clones.</p>

  <p>But Lorena never looked at them. She wasn't interested in any of the bodies he had found.</p>

  <p>Nicholas knew that Lorena loathed these bodies. As a matter of fact, he wasn't surprised by her reaction at all. After all, they were from the divine land. How could she possibly take a fancy to these options?</p>

  <p>All she wanted was only her original body.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Nicholas' offer, Lorena finally opened her eyes slowly, a hint of surprise reflecting in her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"My body has been destroyed. How can you possibly recover it?" Lorena asked, not wanting to believe him.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas saw Lorena's expression, a faint smile appeared on his face and his eyes became deep. "Your body has been destroyed, but it hasn't been destroyed in the Time Sea."</p>

  <p>"Are you planning on entering the Time Sea?" Lorena arched her beautiful brows, feeling confused about Nicholas' statement.</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded slightly. He was indeed planning to do so.</p>

  <p>Lorena sneered, "There are plenty of time fragments in the Time Sea, and those fragments are broken spaces. Entering it to find me in the past is like looking for a needle in a haystack."</p>

  <p>Feeling hopeful, Nicholas answered, "If there is no difficulty in my pursuit, I will gain nothing."</p>

  <p>It was true that locating a specific space and time was much more difficult than looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>Ever since the divine land was built, the Time Sea had slowly expanded, making it harder to explore.</p>

  <p>Every period of time in the space would turn into a colorful piece, falling into the Time Sea. These fragments of time scattered in the water.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas wanted to find Lorena's body, the only way to do it was to find it in the Time Sea. He would need to jump into the past and hope he was lucky. Unfortunately, even with his status, it was impossible to clear up the mess of these fragments.</p>

  <p>Lorena stared at Nicholas. Her expression appeared to be a little complicated.</p>

  <p>It was common for the young to say such ambitious words. However, hearing it from a person who had lived for countless divine eras as the number one Holy Being in the divine land, it sounded really strange.</p>

  <p>At last, Lorena sneered and closed her eyes. She had not decided yet whether or not she would believe in Nicholas' ability to recover her body.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lorena's attitude, Nicholas didn't get annoyed at all. He watched as she let her head slowly bury into the brown liquid again.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Soon, the brown liquid began to boil again, drowning the head back until it was gone.</p>

  <p>As soon as she disappeared, Nicholas gave a bitter smile and decided to leave the palace.</p>

  <p>He had been busy recently. Despite his hectic schedule, he wanted to find a perfect body for Lorena, and at the same time to handle all kinds of things as the ruler of this land.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he reached the Cyan Shadow Hall on the Floating Island of his clan.</p>

  <p>As the clan leader, he came to observe the new excellent disciples of his clan. These were the disciples who made names for themselves recently.</p>

  <p>Some of them were chosen from the Ray Tree, while some were extremely excellent in the arena.</p>

  <p>Stepping into the Cyan Shadow Hall, his previous helpless and sad expression disappeared quietly, replaced by an aura of arrogance bursting out from his body.</p>
