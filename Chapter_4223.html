  <p>
</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess briefly described Zheng's current situation.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Fuxi and the others were worried when they heard that Zheng had fallen into the illusion.</p>

  <p>"What about the Monkey Spirit King? You had many allies with you when you entered the Jade Pure Realm this time," said the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>They were well-prepared for this expedition. They took the necessary precautions and decided it was best to go together.</p>

  <p>One could say that they gathered all of the powerful warriors in the Monkey Spirit Sect, the Bird Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>However, the real Snake Goddess smiled bitterly. "They are still not powerful enough... In the end, we just had to rely on Zheng to kill the Snake Spirit King. Moreover, there is an even more powerful being behind the Snake Spirit King. He is the real root of all this chaos."</p>

  <p>When they heard this, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others fell silent.</p>

  <p>This unexpected turn of events was way beyond their wildest imaginations.</p>

  <p>"Let's try reaching him through the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," suggested the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When they reached another Civilization Artifact, they called out the green figure inside it.</p>

  <p>The green figure immediately responded. It agreed to their request and tried to communicate with Zheng. Unfortunately, it failed again.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization's Civilization Artifact was the only artifact they hadn't tried using. But because the first two Civilization Artifacts already failed, there was no need to try it anymore.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is our only hope now. If he is defeated, then everything will be over..." The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. She was deeply distressed.</p>

  <p>Her beautiful face showed extreme anxiety.</p>

  <p>The others were at a loss for words. They didn't know what else to do.</p>

  <p>Everyone was feeling downhearted and gloomy. All of a sudden, the Snake Goddess raised her head. Her eyes were fixed upon the crimson sky above them.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng started the battle, energies of various colors flowed and danced in the crimson sky. All of the energies gathered in the center of the primitive land. In turn, these energies were being continuously transmitted to Zheng. Even the creatures of the primitive land could sense that, as the energies' aura was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>"I'm just wondering about something. The ancestry-level bloodline is intelligent. Didn't it notice that something happened to Zheng?" the Snake Goddess mused while still staring up at the sky.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess thought for a while. Then, she raised her eyebrows and said, "Maybe it hasn't discovered it yet. We can try communicating with it!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi shrugged his shoulders and said, "The ancestry-level bloodline only communicates with Zheng. It has never communicated with us."</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that this crimson sky possessed intelligence. Zheng had even mentioned it to them before. However, no one ever tried to communicate with it.</p>

  <p>"How will we know what could happen if we don't even try? Let's just do it!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the real Snake Goddess finished speaking, she used the Grand Teleportation technique and headed straight to the top of the primitive land. The others followed her closely.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they felt a strong sense of pressure when the Snake Goddess and the others stood directly below the blood red sky.</p>

  <p>Then, before they could go any further, a thunderous and commanding voice came from the crimson sky. "All of you, retreat!"</p>

  <p>Now that the ancestry-level bloodline was busy transferring the energy to Zheng, it had no time to deal with the creatures in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, everyone was overjoyed when the ancestry-level bloodline spoke. A few moments ago, they were afraid that it wouldn't respond.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess went straight to the point and said, "I am the Snake Goddess, coming down from the altar. Are you aware that Zheng has fallen into the illusion?"</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>There was a trace of bewilderment in the otherwise monotonous voice of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>When the Soul Extreme Form trapped Zheng, it was able to deceive him, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, the irregular heavy sword, and even the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, the ancestry-level bloodline had also been feeling extremely anxious. Something was definitely amiss.</p>

  <p>There was no end to the number of humanoid creatures that kept appearing.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued to fight them, his state of mind became awfully unstable.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had already sensed that there was something wrong. Unfortunately, the Soul Extreme Form could silently affect one's ability to think. Therefore, it was unable to find out what exactly was going on!</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the irregular heavy sword also sensed that something wasn't right.</p>

  <p>But as the warning came from the real Snake Goddess, the ancestry-level bloodline finally figured out what was going on. They had been bewitched by the humanoid being.</p>

  <p>There were cracking sounds that echoed from within the crimson sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't quite remember how many humanoid creatures he had already killed.</p>

  <p>Based on his understanding, the creation of the avatars would exhaust a lot of the humanoid creature's energy.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he hacked these avatars down one by one until the humanoid creature could no longer create them.</p>

  <p>However, the number of humanoid creatures he was facing seemed infinite. He would not be able to kill all of them.</p>

  <p>Little by little, he became more irritable and angrier. His eyes began to glow red. It was as if he was going to devour people.</p>

  <p>"Zheng..." The ancestry-bloodline tried communicating with Zheng. "Zheng, listen to me..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline's voice was coming from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng heard this voice, it seemed like it was coming from a distant place. He did not have the slightest intention of responding to it.</p>

  <p>He was too busy cutting down the humanoid creatures. "Zheng... Zheng..." He couldn't be bothered to listen to this pesky voice.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng didn't respond at all as the ancestry-level bloodline kept calling out his name.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline thought for a while. Soon enough, it came up with a plan to awaken him from this illusion. It injected a violent energy into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>This violent energy did not flow into the irregular heavy sword. Instead, it flowed along Zheng's meridians. And then, it directly exploded within his chest.</p>

  <p>He heard a loud booming sound and suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest.</p>

  <p>It created an open wound on Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>He merely looked down on his chest and then attacked the humanoid creatures frenziedly. He thought that this attack came from the humanoid creatures. Naturally, he counterattacked even more wildly!</p>

  <p>"It's useless. I should try something else..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline paused for a moment to think of another plan. This time, it launched a soul attack on Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the blood red sky flashed, a brown aura gathered in the center of the primitive land. It instantly entered Zheng's body and turned into a sharp needle. It headed straight for Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Just as the needle was drilling into Zheng's mind, a streak of white flashing light burst out of his mind and extinguished the needle in an instant!</p>

  <p>"What just happened? What is that?"</p>

  <p>At first, the ancestry-level bloodline was stunned. Nonetheless, it immediately understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>The difference between the energies of the fifth-grade world and the fourth-grade world in terms of strength was not that huge.</p>

  <p>After all, the energies from the fifth-grade world only changed from one hundred and forty kinds to three hundred and seventy-three kinds in the fourth-grade world.</p>

  <p>But they would develop into three thousand kinds in the third-grade world. The gap between them would be very huge.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current situation was very similar to being caught in the mind trapping technique. However, the humanoid creature's theurgy was obviously stronger than the mind trapping technique of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"I see. So it can only be consumed little by little..."</p>

  <p>As soon as it figured this out, the ancestry-level bloodline started to attack Zheng's soul incessantly.</p>

  <p>As expected, these soul attacks were quickly blocked by the white light and were extinguished in a flash.</p>

  <p>Even though the flashing white light was powerful, it was still limited.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was still stubbornly killing those humanoid creatures. He was continuously absorbing the white light. The speed at which the light was consumed was not as fast as the speed in which he replenished it.</p>

  <p>As the ancestry-level bloodline's soul attacks became more intense and relentless, the speed at which the white flashing light was consumed became faster!</p>

  <p>Slowly, the hostility on Zheng's face began to fade. His bright red eyes gradually returned to their original color.</p>

  <p>"What is happening? How..."</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature was not that far from where Zheng was standing. A look of surprise flashed in his compound eyes.</p>

  <p>"How are you able to break free from the Soul Extreme Form? It is quite impossible... Ah, I see. Someone is helping you..."</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature was shocked. However, he didn't pay much attention to it.</p>

  <p>His goal was not Zheng to begin with. It was the irregular heavy sword he was after.</p>

  <p>As long as this sword was detached from Zheng, he had nothing to fear.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the white light in Zheng's mind faded away. Finally, he came to his senses. Only then did he realize that the ones he killed were not the humanoid creatures, but merely black bugs.</p>
