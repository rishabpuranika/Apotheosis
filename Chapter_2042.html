<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2042 The Rampant Sword Intent </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Many scenarios could happen during a battle. When a martial artist was at a disadvantage, however, it would be difficult to reverse the situation— especially if both parties' strengths were at a similar level.</p>

  <p>It was known that Maha was the number one Godly Genius of the Sacred race. He knew how to execute numerous methods and could think of ways to evade his opponent in the most dangerous situations.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had extremely sharp senses and had quickly discerned that the icy blue flame was quite strange. As soon as he determined that he couldn't fight head on against it, his body immediately sank.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng had failed to hit him when they passed by each other in midair.</p>

  <p>The red light around Maha flashed as he descended down, and then a blade appeared in his hand. His lips curved up into a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>"Light Wheel Slash!"</p>

  <p>Circular rays of the blade light spread out around Maha at a high speed and sliced through him like mad. The surrounding air became extremely chaotic. The saber emitted ear-piercing splitting sounds, which were similar to a disastrous flute playing.</p>

  <p>The circular rays of the blade light enveloped Maha in a radius of one thousand feet. The area where he stood was a dead zone; not even the smallest of mosquitoes would be able to find a gap to escape!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng stood directly above Maha where the blade light was the most concentrated.</p>

  <p>However, Maha's attacks didn't faze him at all. When Maha brought out his saber, he already had the Great Weighty Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Maha's saber was extremely nimble and agile like a small viper. It could attack its opponent numerous times from any angle, and its every move was fatal.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's Great Weighty Sword was like a giant dragon hidden in an abyss. It was immensely heavy, but once it had launched an attack, it only needed a single strike to kill its opponent!</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom, boom…"</p>

  <p>Zheng held the Great Weighty Sword horizontally in front of his chest as the countless light wheels shot towards him.</p>

  <p>The clashing of the sword and saber should've created a melodious sound, but because of the Great Weighty Sword's power, the weapons produced an extremely dull, metallic clang like a large bell.</p>

  <p>"How can you block it that easily?" Maha sneered. He turned the saber in his hand with a contemptuous look. Once again, the second wave of the Light Wheel Slash struck at Zheng.</p>

  <p>While Maha had suffered a loss while fighting Zheng with brute force, he was highly confident in his speed.</p>

  <p>In addition, Maha and even the vast majority of martial artists thought that offense was the best defense. It wouldn't do any good to resist just like what Zheng did and besides, it wasn't hard for him to break through Zheng's line of defenses.</p>

  <p>Maha continued to alter between his moves as the circular rays of the blade light moved in an increasingly strange direction. They drew an arc in the air when they slashed at Zheng, avoiding his Great Weighty Sword, and slashing towards his body.</p>

  <p>Maha smirked at the sight.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, the smirk on his face froze in place.</p>

  <p>"Clank, clank, clank..."</p>

  <p>Maha knew the power of the circular blade light that was created by the Light Wheel Slash very well.</p>

  <p>Back then when he had practiced the Light Wheel Slash, he had chopped the Heavenly Divine Shield— one of the supreme divine weapons in the Murphy Universe, into pieces.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only dressed in a thin robe which seemed to have no defensive powers. Therefore, the Light Wheel Slash should've cut straight into his body.</p>

  <p>What Maha never expected was that the dozen rays of circular blade light failed to even leave a mark on Zheng's robe, let alone cut it into pieces.</p>

  <p>What was that thing made of?</p>

  <p>Not even Maha's knowledge and experience gave him any insight as he was still a bit stunned. Such an incident was truly odd to witness.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't need to block..."</p>

  <p>A small smile was plastered on Zheng's face as he gently brandished the Great Weighty Sword. He completely gave up on defense and kept his sword at his side. His eyes glinted ruthlessly and all his emotions left his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng still hadn't struck out with his sword, but Maha's heart suddenly raced in shock.</p>

  <p>A foreboding feeling suddenly flashed in his mind like a lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>The feeling tugged at the depths of his heart and desperately urged him to flee!</p>

  <p>The Maha from before would face all kinds of danger without thought, and could always win over everyone in the end. After all, he was a Godly Genius and the most remarkable talent of the Murphy Universe. He utilized all his resources well and always had many opportunities. He was always lucky.</p>

  <p>If Maha only had a 1% chance of defeating his opponent, then he still thought that he could beat them. This was because he was always able to receive fate's blessing.</p>

  <p>This time however, he didn't dare defy his instincts.</p>

  <p>He actually had no chance of winning against Zheng's sword strike!</p>

  <p>Of course, he was more than unwilling to accept this, but he didn't want to take the risk. He floated away in the air and went back to retreat.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he stayed in the air above Maha and as Maha continued to move back, he smashed directly into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound as a massive hole was formed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Maha slammed his body down on the hard soil, and then drilled into it.</p>

  <p>He continued to drill into the ground while Zheng launched his sword strike!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had become a world lord, he came to have a deeper understanding of the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In order to enhance the Gods-intimidating Strike's power back then, Zheng had constantly imbued the laws into the sword intent. Now, it was no longer needed at this point.</p>

  <p>He slashed his sword downwards with all his might. Combined with the Great Weighty Sword's own power which was activated by the chaotic energy, it was safe to say that Zheng's attack was tremendously deadly.</p>

  <p>In this whole universe at least, no one would be able to withstand such a strike.</p>

  <p>Just then, an invisible sword intent that contained an astonishing aura was dispersed down from the sky at an exceedingly high speed. The warriors in the distance just glanced at it, but quickly felt like their eyes had been pierced by needles!</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The long and narrow sword intent continued to scatter everywhere. A soon as it touched the ground, it penetrated the soil and created a huge crack. When viewed from above, the crack looked like a scar.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The sword intent continued to wreak havoc deep underground as the crack continued to extend. It didn't take too long before the Iron Moon City was split into two halves, but the crack continued to extend like there was no end.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been hit," Zheng muttered coldly.</p>

  <p>As soon as Maha was beneath the ground, he dove towards the other side. He moved extraordinarily fast, as if he was a field mouse being chased by a cat in the barn. Then, an unmistakable ravine appeared.</p>

  <p>"Again..."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't think twice and immediately smashed towards Maha with his sword once more.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>"Hooo, hooo, hooo…"</p>

  <p>Once again, Maha was able to dodge the sword intent ahead of time as he constantly changed the direction in which he was headed to escape.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>"Hooo, hooo, hooo..."</p>

  <p>At the same time, the fierce sword intent continued to rain down on him.</p>

  <p>Maha was very shocked, and felt that he was truly unlucky today.</p>

  <p>After Zheng slashed out his first sword strike, Maha had already decided to avoid his opponent's attack first and then quickly find a chance to counterattack. According to his experience, Zheng would always have a moment of weakness after he displayed this terrifying sword move.</p>

  <p>Thus, it would be the best time for him to strike back.</p>

  <p>Then again, ideas were always wonderful; but reality was always cruel.</p>

  <p>He never expected for Zheng to repeatedly launch his attacks.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, each of his sword strikes was comparable to the all-out attack of a Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>What was worse was that he had launched three sword attacks in a row without any rest or hesitation. He also did not gather any momentum.</p>

  <p>How did he make it?</p>

  <p>Most importantly, how big was his inner world?</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a world lord's inner world was limited in size. No matter how much life vitality it had, it still wouldn't be enough for a large consumption. Even Maha's inner world wouldn't be able to last long if he had used such a skill.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had already slashed out ten sword strikes in just a short period of time. If Maha tried to do that, he might've used up all the life vitality in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Yet there was Zheng, who still looked so vigorous. He didn't look the least bit exhausted!</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Huge amounts of sword intent continued to descend upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Several streams of the sword intent had even cut through the Sunflower Water World. They left numerous cracks all over the place, which made the supreme world they were in look like a face that was full of scratches.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the entire supreme world had lost its stability and began to tremble continuously.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Supreme Lords who hid in secret places saw the scene, and were speechless with shock.</p>
