<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A sense of relief washed over those gathered in the passageway.</p>

  <p>They knew the chances were slim with what Kincaid said, but at least there was a possibility.</p>

  <p>"But even if Elder Xue was alive, how would we get in touch with him?"</p>

  <p>Hilario pointed out.</p>

  <p>It was a serious question and a realistic concern, though it sounded pessimistic.</p>

  <p>They were in the third-grade world now. They'd have to cross the main world to enter the Deep Space and reach Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>But the entire main world had become a barren wasteland after the calamity Cornelius brought upon it. Neither the Treacherous Beings nor the long-haired monsters could return.</p>

  <p>New creatures and races had appeared in the main world over time, but they were entirely different to those in the past.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters looked hopefully at Kincaid, as well.</p>

  <p>They were eagerly waiting for a definite answer, too.</p>

  <p>They were more afraid of having no purpose in life than death itself. They would dedicate themselves to any goal Kincaid gave them.</p>

  <p>A look of hesitation flashed across Kincaid's face.</p>

  <p>If they couldn't enter the main world, then they couldn't reach the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>There was no way to communicate with Elder Xue unless he reached out himself using the Heaven Projection.</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid, we have two human beings in the main world," Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>"You have people there?" Kincaid looked surprised. "But if they haven't gone through the Red Jade Rite, wouldn't it be difficult for them to move around in the main world?"</p>

  <p>The Red Jade Rite was an exclusive method of the Four Spirits Sect allowing creatures from the third-grade world to enter the fourth-grade world.</p>

  <p>But if even the Four Spirits Sect could no longer use the Red Jade Rite, how could anyone else?</p>

  <p>"One of them indeed has been rendered immobile, but the other, my son, can walk freely throughout the main world even without having undergone the Red Jade Rite," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Kincaid's eyes lit up. "Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"He has climbed to the top of a holy pillar," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Kincaid looked impressed.</p>

  <p>"It's amazing someone from the secondary world was able to get that far!</p>

  <p>I once captured some powerhouses of the third-grade world and let them into the main world. However, they immediately lost their sight and hearing as soon as they entered there without going through the rite!"</p>

  <p>The Red Jade Rite was a method created by the Bold Conjecture House which had concluded, based on many experiments, that the third-grade world creatures could only survive in the third-grade world. They were unable to inhabit the main world without external intervention.</p>

  <p>Powerful individuals like Ziya had tried many times, but even he could only barely walk in the main world.</p>

  <p>"Would we be able to contact him?" Kincaid pressed, harboring none of the doubts his companions had on what Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment. "Yes. He can deliver information through an Other Shore Token, but he is unable to do that of late as he is adjusting its ability."</p>

  <p>Kincaid was ecstatic. "Great!"</p>

  <p>He began clapping.</p>

  <p>Anyone who knew Kincaid knew of his habit of clapping his hands when he was excited.</p>

  <p>"Fate truly works in mysterious ways. The Deep Space should have been beyond us, but now, we have this chance! We must seize it!" Kincaid said, beaming.</p>

  <p>As things were settling down at the passageway, the Other Shore was in a state of chaos.</p>

  <p>The golden light columns that had appeared had thrown all the inhabitants of Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>What kind of theurgy was it that it could even directly pierce through the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and the Element Spirit Civilization had been the first to see this threat coming.</p>

  <p>They had not personally participated in the battle that had happened in the Jade Pure Realm, but they knew it would impact the Other Shore tremendously.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had been hoping that the Snake Spirit Sect would win.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was thinking how to negotiate with the Monkey Spirit Sect after the Bird Spirit Sect had secured victory in battle.</p>

  <p>He had been monitoring the situation from the Supreme Pure Realm when he noticed that the water in the Divine River began to flow backwards!</p>

  <p>It was a first in all of history. He knew it signaled great turmoil in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Just then, black circular shadows appeared in the sky. Purple-black energy spheres started pouring down from them.</p>

  <p>These energy spheres were powerful and near-unstoppable. They had just decimated the Jade Pure Realm and had now leaked through to the Supreme Pure Realm. They would soon ravage the entire Other Shore if left unhampered!</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature had no intention of stopping at present.</p>

  <p>A purple light appeared in the distance and began to spread. As it did, a huge bird-shaped Treacherous Being appeared in front of the humanoid creature. It was the Bird Spirit King, Sheehan, who remained unawakened.</p>

  <p>Sheehan, in fact, could never be awakened. He was already under the complete control of the humanoid creature. According to his plan, if the Snake Spirit King failed, the humanoid creature would use the Bird Spirit King instead.</p>

  <p>In the battle with Zheng, the humanoid creature had used a clever method to grab the sword, so the Bird Spirit King never had a chance to fight.</p>

  <p>Instead of killing him, however, the humanoid creature chose to just use him as a mount.</p>

  <p>Sheehan lowered his head obediently while the humanoid creature stepped onto his back.</p>

  <p>Since the energy spheres had completely devastated the Jade Pure Realm, the humanoid creature had been able to see though to the Supreme Pure Realm. The energy spheres had also allowed him to find the Grandmaster of Heaven from far away.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven spotted the humanoid creature in the distant sky, he froze in shock.</p>

  <p>He had braced himself for this, but now it was here, and it seemed to be a hundred times worse than he had ever imagined.</p>

  <p>The entire Jade Pure Realm was destroyed.</p>

  <p>And the Bird Spirit King was enslaved by that strange creature.</p>

  <p>How could things have gotten this bad?</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature's sharp eyes fell on the Grandmaster of Heaven. It sent chills down his spine.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven hurriedly took out the Descending Ring. He knew the sensible thing to do right now was to get away and keep himself safe. After all, his greatest protector had already fallen.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature just scoffed seeing the Grandmaster of Heaven scramble to escape.</p>

  <p>His mocking laughter rang through the air as he rode the Bird Spirit King away.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven gritted his teeth and hissed in humiliation. As the leader of the Nihility race, he was held in high esteem on the Other Shore. But now, he was looked down upon. He had the sudden urge to fight the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>But he soon snapped out of it as he noticed more purple-black energy spheres falling around him. He activated the Descending Ring and disappeared from the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>As this happened, the purple-black energy spheres also started appearing in the sky of the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore races in the Grand Pure Realm were gripped with horror upon seeing them. They never imagined the Three Purities Stage would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Some of the Other Shore creatures quickly began to flee toward Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, the Grand Plain Stage, but most of them were paralyzed by shock. By the time they gathered their wits about them, it was too late.</p>

  <p>They could do nothing but watch as their lives, their friends and family, and their homeland for billions of years were wiped out in a snap.</p>
