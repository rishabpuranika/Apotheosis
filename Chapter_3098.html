<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3098 Invasion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the human race had Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Divine Farmer behind them, they had a strong sense of crisis whenever the other races launched attacks on them.</p>

  <p>Such sacrifices were common for the continuation of their race.</p>

  <p>"But what's the use of you coming to the Blue Cloud City?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>A tinge of sadness flashed across Gant's eyes, but before Zheng could ask again, he shook his head and said, "I know it's useless. I just want to see her."</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that he couldn't change Gant's mind, so he just sighed, "After this half of a month, I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>In the next few days, Zheng and the others stayed on the city wall in the southern part of the city.</p>

  <p>Maxim had mentioned that if the Sun Crow race attacked, their horns would sound, but several days passed, and they didn't hear the sound of the horns.</p>

  <p>Gradually, they started to let their hair down and relax.</p>

  <p>Alfie volunteered to keep watch since it was relatively calm anyway, and honestly, quite boring. He could handle the watch duty on his own just fine.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the others sat cross-legged and went to the Other Shore, focused on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Zheng also found a corner, where he sat and set up an enchanted barrier. Once everything was ready, he entered the Sea of Truth with his body.</p>

  <p>His soul had reached the Other Shore, but his body stayed in the sixth line of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>It was much easier for him to swim in the Sea of Truth than sail the Truth Boat. After he crossed the sixth line, the blood-red water began to boil, but he barely felt the heat.</p>

  <p>It took Zheng's soul half a year to travel to the Other Shore in Dragon City, but his body took significantly less time.</p>

  <p>It only took him six days to travel from the sixth line to the ninth line.</p>

  <p>The warm water enveloped his body as he swam, and as he looked up, numerous Truth Boats appeared in front of him, most of them moored in the ninth line. It appeared that his presence had started a commotion.</p>

  <p>"Someone is swimming in the sea!"</p>

  <p>"I've seen this before, but nobody believed me when I told them! Now, he has even reached the ninth line!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! He is not afraid of the seawater's erosion. How powerful is he?"</p>

  <p>The Truth Boats that were closest to Zheng started to come nearer in an attempt to befriend him.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I don't know where you are from, but our sect wants to recruit you and offer you the best treatment."</p>

  <p>"I'm a disciple of a powerful sect. If you haven't joined any force, I can recommend you."</p>

  <p>"I'm a member of the Bearing race..."</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored all the voices that were calling to him like sirens, but when he heard someone mention the Bearing race, he hesitated in his tracks. He sought the speaker and looked him up and down, while the man stopped speaking abruptly. It was like he swallowed his tongue the moment Zheng met his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race held a deep enmity with the Bearing race, but the speaker was innocent. It wouldn't be right to punish him for the sins of his race when he didn't do anything wrong. And so, Zheng restrained his impulse and swam away.</p>

  <p>There were usually tens of thousands of warriors gathered to try to reach the Other Shore. Today was not a good day to do that, but it didn't matter for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under the gazes of the True Gods in the ninth line, Zheng swam to the Other Shore alone.</p>

  <p>Huge waves that were covered with raging flames rolled toward Zheng, like a towering inferno.</p>

  <p>He dived into the sea swiftly and avoided the flaming waves effortlessly.</p>

  <p>'It seems that it is much easier for my body to reach the Other Shore than my soul. Maybe this is the reason why this method was forbidden, ' he thought as he continued to swim.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, Zheng finally reached the Other Shore. He stood at the beach, the golden sand warm on his toes.</p>

  <p>He thought of the Sacred Mallow Temple, as he closed his eyes and basked in the warmth he felt.</p>

  <p>He still had the Other Shore Key, which could open the Sacred Mallow Temple. He remembered that he saw a crack at the top of the temple during the last exploration, and he wondered if there was something hidden behind that crack.</p>

  <p>According to Dorothy, the stones in the Sacred Mallow Temple were excellent Other Shore Tokens. He could take some away and sell them for soul pills.</p>

  <p>Just as he determined to go to the Sacred Mallow Temple, he felt a stirring from his enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Earlier, before he started to practice, he had made a deal with Gant.</p>

  <p>They agreed that once the Sun Crow race arrived to invade them, Gant would touch the enchanted barrier he set up. That way, he could wake up swiftly. Cultivation was extremely risky in the face of such a strong enemy.</p>

  <p>He knew then that he must leave. Without hesitation, he left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At the other side, even before he opened his eyes, he could hear the sound of horns. It sounded like a stampede of beasts, deafening and wild.</p>

  <p>He quickly removed the enchanted barrier and leaped for the city wall.</p>

  <p>Others were standing tensely, their eyes locked at the horizon. All of them were looking at the distance, alert for any sign of their enemies' presence.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed when he spotted them. There was a cluster of dark clouds in the distance that blotted out the sky and sun. It was the Sun Crows gathered in the sky, so numerous that they appeared as one black dot.</p>

  <p>Strange sounds echoed from far away as if millions of demons were whispering in the air. The whispers felt intimately close, a caress of death in their ears, whispers of fear that clutched at their uneasy hearts.</p>

  <p>"There are so many crows. How can we defeat them?" Alfie said with a sullen face.</p>

  <p>He thought that the Blue Cloud City was just a small city and that the Sun Crow race wouldn't bother to attack it. Oh, how wrong he was.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be a big problem," Rupert said with a cautious expression.</p>

  <p>"Blue Cloud City doesn't rely on us. We just need to guard this area."</p>

  <p>There were many Oneness Guards in Blue Cloud City, and some of them were five-star ones.</p>

  <p>The senior leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace were not idiots. They would save these guards if they failed to defend the Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>"They're coming." Zheng's eyes narrowed. It felt like the wind had stopped blowing and was instead being sucked away. Everything had grown eerily quiet.</p>

  <p>The distant black clouds had suddenly dispersed and moved towards Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>The clouds were gigantic so they looked slow, but in fact, the Sun Crows were flying at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>When the dark clouds were around thirty miles away from the city, Zheng suddenly felt an irresistible aura behind him.</p>

  <p>Four huge light columns appeared in the city, and within the light columns, small white swords materialized. The swords soared into the sky, interlaced with each other, and then rushed in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Wow! It's the Array of Innumerable Swords. The number of divine crystals used to shoot that amount of swords at the same time must be astronomical," Rupert exclaimed.</p>

  <p>As an orthodox sword sect, the Oneness Sky Palace had all sorts of powerful sword arrays. The Array of Innumerable Swords was one of them.</p>

  <p>The number of divine crystals that were spent on such a sword array was unimaginable. More than one hundred million divine crystals were probably spent per salvo.</p>

  <p>The swishing sound the swords made filled the quiet of the wee hours of morning.</p>

  <p>The still dark sky was tinged blacker than usual.</p>

  <p>Countless small white swords flew, and the light they emitted lit up the whole sky.</p>

  <p>The white swords swiftly rushed towards the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>The white swords painted the sky in the colors of daylight, only to disperse and mix with the darkness of the Sun Crows. It appeared like a black-and-white painting, a breathtaking view, as they entangled and engulfed each other.</p>

  <p>Soon, the dark crows lessened significantly. Countless black dots fell from the sky like raindrops, and the corpses of the Sun Crows piled up high on the ground.</p>

  <p>The vast wilderness outside the Blue Cloud City was overlaid with black, and the metallic smell of blood filled the air.</p>
