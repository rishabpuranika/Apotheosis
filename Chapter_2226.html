<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2226 Measures To Save The Ranking </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In the Spiritual Heart Hall of the Floating Island of Han Clan, over a hundred important figures of the Han Clan gathered together. They were all sitting in a row in the capacious Spiritual Heart Hall.</p>

  <p>In the middle sat the present-day leader of the Han Clan, Alfredo Han, while Joy, the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan sat next to him.</p>

  <p>She was sitting on a thick blanket, her elegant dress making her look like a royalty. She had a blank expression on her face as she gazed across the group of people.</p>

  <p>Everyone went silent as Alfredo stood up. He directed his gaze towards Joy and said, "Joy, it is your Purple Soul Hall that is bringing us down this time. If we don't take the necessary measures, I am afraid the ranking of the Floating Island would drop further by two places." His voice was calm yet affirming.</p>

  <p>The whole place fell silent.</p>

  <p>As the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, Joy was only second to the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Although Alfredo Han was only at the consummation of True God Realm, the Holy Beings of all powerful clans on the Floating islands never interfered in the affairs on the islands. The Holy Emperor of the Han Clan also trusted him and took his word for everything, never getting in his way unless it was a matter of life or death.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Han Clan knew how short-tempered and quick-witted Joy was. She had always been arrogant and rowdy. People wondered how Joy would react since Alfredo Han accused her in her face.</p>

  <p>"It's not a big deal if the ranking drops," Joy said calmly yet distractedly, much to everyone's surprise.</p>

  <p>Alfredo Han knew what Joy would say. "Joy, if the ranking of our Floating Island drops out of the top ten, not only we would lose a lot of opportunities, but our warriors would also suffer great loss. Surely you can't be serious?" He frowned, much to Joy's dismay.</p>

  <p>Alfredo Han always tolerated Joy in the past. He had given the Purple Soul Hall many privileges. But his patience was running out.</p>

  <p>He knew that the results would be catastrophic if the Han Clan Floating Island's ranking dropped by further two places. For this particular matter, he had sought the Holy Emperor's guidance who advised him to be stern, as far as Joy was concerned.</p>

  <p>Joy couldn't care less. "Nonetheless, we the Purple Soul Hall can't do anything about it. Our female warriors are not as talented as the warriors of the main Han Clan, so expecting them to earn more points would be unrealistic," she proclaimed.</p>

  <p>Only the best of the best got recruited by the Han Clan Floating Island.</p>

  <p>These warriors had to go through various difficult tests in order to get recruited by the Heavenly Han House. All of these warriors proved their worth in the Han Clan's ancestral land.</p>

  <p>Joy on the other hand had a different criteria for recruitment: as long as one possessed the Purple Power Body and could be acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablet of the Purple Aura Godly Way, they could be recruited.</p>

  <p>After all, a small amount of people possessed a Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was impossible for the Purple Soul Hall to recruit talents the same way as the main Han Clan did.</p>

  <p>Due to this, the strength of the Purple Soul Hall was relatively weak on the whole, having a little to no advantage in the Arena of Legends. Thus, the Purple Soul Hall was solely responsible for holding the main Han Clan back.</p>

  <p>Joy was aware of this fact. She was strong herself, but she knew that she wasn't quite good at managing her disciples. She usually had a laissez-faire approach and spoiled the warriors in the Purple Soul Hall. But when the warriors really got out of control, she had to ask Madam Moon to punish the warriors who were holding back the ranking of the Han Clan Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't the few proving godly warriors in the Purple Soul Hall that were bringing the ranking down, but rather the entire Purple Soul Hall. Therefore, the whole Purple Soul Hall needed to improve its performance.</p>

  <p>Alfredo Han already knew that Joy would try to buy her way out of this.</p>

  <p>"No, there's a way. Expel all the proving godly warriors from the Purple Soul Hall and eighty percent of the True Gods that are ranked at the bottom. This way, we are confident to raise the total points of the whole Floating Island," he stated.</p>

  <p>The points of a Floating Island were the total points of all the warriors in the Floating Island that had fought in the Arena of Legends. If the disciples of the Purple Soul Hall were expelled and their jade tokens were cancelled, then the warriors of the Purple Soul Hall who were responsible for bringing the ranking down would be excluded. Thus, the points of the Floating Island would rise to a great extent.</p>

  <p>"Expel eighty percent of our Purple Soul Hall disciples?!" Joy exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Joy had expected that Alfredo Han would ask her to dispel her disciples.</p>

  <p>If it was the only way, she would compromise. After all, she was the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan. Whatever decision she had to take, it had to be for the betterment of the clan.</p>

  <p>But it was absolutely ridiculous to expel all the proving godly warriors and eighty percent of the True Gods. She was thinking of expelling the bottom ten percent of the disciples, not more than that. This strange request of Alfredo Han surprised her.</p>

  <p>This was equivalent to shutting down the Purple Soul Hall!</p>

  <p>Not only Joy, but the rest of the Han Clan members present were shocked as well.</p>

  <p>Joy had the potential to become a Holy Being. If the Han Clan had two Holy Beings, the status of Han Clan would ultimately rise again. They felt as if Alfredo Han was doing her injustice.</p>

  <p>"I shall agree to no such thing," said Joy, shaking her head. Her graceful face darkened.</p>

  <p>"This is not my request." Alfredo Han continued, "This is what the Holy Emperor ordered. If you have any objection, you can talk to him. By the way, Holy Emperor is also very concerned about the possibility that our Floating Island's ranking might drop. He will never allow the ranking of our Han Clan to drop out of the top ten. It's useless going to him...</p>

  <p>Unless you can improve the overall points of the Purple Soul Hall in three months!"</p>

  <p>Every year, the rankings of the Floating Islands were calculated and after three months, the points of all the Floating Islands on the Time Sea were tallied in order to decide their rankings.</p>

  <p>Even though Joy was a Demi-holy Being, it was quite impossible for her to completely transform the Purple Soul Hall. She was aware of the fact that Demi-holy Beings were not allowed to fight in the Arena of Legends. Therefore no matter how powerful she was, she wouldn't be able to affect the points of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>"Is that what the Holy Emperor really said?" Smiling ruefully at Alfredo Han, she took off from the ground, making her way towards the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan. She knew she would never believe it unless she heard from the Holy Emperor himself.</p>

  <p>"Master, isn't it too much to expel eighty percent of the disciples from the Purple Soul Hall?" asked a member of the Han Clan, with deep concern in his voice.</p>

  <p>The warriors with Purple Power Bodies in the Purple Soul Hall were quite rare and not easy to come by. They were the resources that Joy had accumulated over the years. Although, the warriors with Purple Power Bodies were weak at first, but once they showed their true potential, they became quite powerful. Joy was a case in point.</p>

  <p>"We can't wait that long," said Alfredo Han with a determined look on his face. "The Holy Emperor has already made his new plan. We must stay within the top ten."</p>

  <p>Joy visited the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, and no one knew how the talk went. After she came back, she gathered all the disciples of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>All the disciples gathered together in front of a huge platform inside the Purple Soul Hall. One of those disciples was Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were about thirty to forty thousand female disciples present in the hall.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heard about men who possessed the Purple Power Body in the Purple Soul Hall before but he had never seen one since he came here.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around and finally saw two men with the rare Purple Power Body. They both were behaving like women, just like the eunuchs in the royal palace of the mortal world.</p>

  <p>All in all, Zheng quite possibly was the only real man in the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>The door behind the platform was suddenly pushed wide open, much to everyone's surprise, and a group of top-rank True Gods emerged through it. Among them were Madam Moon and Mae.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods covered both sides of the platform.</p>

  <p>A moment later, another woman walked through the door.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's knowledge, Zheng could clearly distinguish among the low-rank, the mid-rank and the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>But the aura emitted from this woman was unfathomable and divine.</p>

  <p>"Is this Joy?" Zheng asked in his mind. "A Demi-holy Being's aura is quite extraordinary and overwhelming!"</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng complimented, Master Evil couldn't help but say, "This woman is not Joy. Joy is a Demi-holy Being of Han Clan, and her cultivation is only second to that of a Holy Being. This woman is actually a consummate True God, to be precise."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see," Zheng felt a bit embarrassed by his lack of knowledge.</p>

  <p>True Gods at the consummate level had perfected their own inner worlds, and only required to merge with the nine stars to create their own universes. Their strength was indeed unparalleled.</p>

  <p>"This woman must be Joy's eldest disciple," Master Evil speculated.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, another woman made her way through the door. She had an expression of distress on her face and the corners of her eyes were red as if she had cried. Her original charming and dignified face now revealed a hint of gloom.</p>
