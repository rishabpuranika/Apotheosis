<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1715 A Big Gap </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In this world, some people were purely opponents, while others were both friends and opponents.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was one of the latter, and Tianming was clear on this point.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the broken sword beside him.</p>

  <p>The color of the sword was dim, and its body was somewhat broken. It now looked like an ordinary metal sword.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman had used it many times.</p>

  <p>In this fight, it would also be a useful weapon for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, he firmly grasped the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The moment he touched the broken sword, he felt a strange thought connect with him through the blade.</p>

  <p>The thought strikingly did not convey any particular message as it merely made Luo Luo Zheng feel rather friendly.</p>

  <p>And this denoted that the sword had an undeniably strong sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only temporarily activated the sword, and the sword spirit hadn't proactively communicated with him. They had come to a tacit understanding and were cooperating only for now.</p>

  <p>When he raised the sword, he realized that he seemed to be holding a feather. It was so light against his grip as if he was holding nothing.</p>

  <p>Explicitly, Luo Luo Zheng was not used to such a light sword. No one would be willing to take a feather-like weapon to fight the enemy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt an unexpected emotion that suddenly took him by surprise.</p>

  <p>There was an exceedingly comfortable and heavy feeling transmitted from his hand as he waved his sword once, in a circular motion.</p>

  <p>"How clever!" It turned out that the sword would adjust its weight according to Luo Zheng's movements.</p>

  <p>Whir! After waving his sword for a while, Luo Luo Zheng held it horizontally and nodded towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>He had learned a lot from this battle with Tianming and gained new insights into his swordsmanship. However, this did not mean that he would lose to Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming faintly smiled as the Soaring Snake Sword rose once again.</p>

  <p>And the white light that became visible under his feet was like mercury, spreading out in all directions.</p>

  <p>The light quickly spread all the way down, covering the cross point in the middle of Heaven Earth Board, the many stones on it, the entire board, and finally, Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>It was clear as water that the imposing Mu Ning emitted from Tianming's body was undoubtedly incomparable!</p>

  <p>The Justice Divine Dao was about a type of supreme faith.</p>

  <p>Although Karl had already stepped into the Divine Dao, he had gone off course. Thus, his sense of justice was quite bigoted. Most people thought that he had been insane.</p>

  <p>The sword stood right in front of Tianming's face, and his eyes flashed with searing light.</p>

  <p>Everyone could perceive that Tianming was going to end this battle.</p>

  <p>He had held the advantage right from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Consequently, all the people in the universe, including many world lords and Supreme Lords, thought and somehow expected that he would win.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Then the chaotic energy in his body surged out and began to gather in his right arm, fluidly spreading to the broken sword.</p>

  <p>"Pure chaotic energy!"</p>

  <p>The sword spirit within the sword was extremely excited.</p>

  <p>Previously, it was only wondering how Luo Luo Zheng could unleash that kind of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But now, the sword spirit fully understood that this fellow genuinely possessed chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>While the incomparably pure chaotic energy was overflowing and soaking into the sword, the sword spirit was absorbing it with great restraint.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had also felt the change in the sword when a portion of its chaotic energy seemed to be stolen. But then he realized that it was only a tiny fraction after he had just poured his chaotic energy into the sword. The amount was less than one ten thousandth of his chaotic sea, so he didn't care at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the sword spirit was different. In the beginning, it extremely restrained itself in absorbing the chaotic energy needed to nourish its body. It was not a duplicate in the Illusion Space, but a true creature in the Illusion Battlefield, so the nourishment was of great benefit to it.</p>

  <p>It felt that even if Luo Luo Zheng possessed chaotic energy, he didn't have that much, so it restrained itself.</p>

  <p>But then, the sword spirit was stunned.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the amount of chaotic energy that emerged from Luo Zheng's body had exceeded the sword spirit's imagination.</p>

  <p>'How did this fellow do it?' wondered the sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly lifted his sword, his feet arched and his gaze cold.</p>

  <p>He also knew that it was high time for the victor to be decided.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng exuded confidence in himself, he realized that there was indeed an enormous gap between him and his opponent.</p>

  <p>Tianming had only cultivated for a few years before he followed Luo Luo Zheng all the way and even surpassed him. Even Luo Luo Zheng had to admire him for that.</p>

  <p>Bearing this clear understanding in his mind, Luo Luo Zheng would not readily admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>"Let's do it again. The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>Sensing the direction in which Luo Zheng's sword was dancing, the sword spirit that was immersed in the chaotic energy tried its best to coordinate with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a supreme chaotic weapon in the first place.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng skillfully learned to use the Metal Law to bear the chaotic energy from it.</p>

  <p>With their full cooperation, the sword spirit could take advantage of the situation and unleash an even more powerful strength.</p>

  <p>The streaks of golden light turned into golden lotuses that radiated strands after strands of gray light. This strike was far more dazzling than the previous one.</p>

  <p>Lone kept silent the whole time. He felt disturbed as he watched Luo Luo Zheng unleash that broken sword's power. However, he had lent it to Luo Luo Zheng on his own accord because it was for the sake of his beloved sword.</p>

  <p>"Come on," Tianming urged, smiling faintly. "It's the most suitable place to end our fight here."</p>

  <p>Tianming had firmly made up his mind to win this battle.</p>

  <p>As he lifted the Soaring Snake Sword, layers upon layers of rhombic internal momentum began to interweave. Like sparkling and translucent gems, they exuded a pure and flawless luster.</p>

  <p>They were densely packed together, occupying all the space around Tianming. And all that was left was a path.</p>

  <p>Following that path, Tianming raised his sword, took a step, and sprinted.</p>

  <p>It was as though a dragon from the depths of the abyss had abruptly emerged from a path within the canyon. The silver light on the surface of his sword radiated another layer of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The astonishing, powerful Mu Ning left the audience shocked beyond comparison.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Tianming rushed straight towards Luo Luo Zheng and the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike that the latter had thrust out with utmost urgency as if he was getting impatient to win this battle over.</p>

  <p>Dodging was even out of his option, but instead, he charged headlong against Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>That extremely sharp golden-gray sword light pierced towards Tianming and passed through the perfectly straight Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>An ear-piercing howl echoed out.</p>

  <p>That sword light was cut in half by the bright silver light in Tianming's hand!</p>

  <p>Everyone mused that Tianming coped with the enemy head-on.</p>

  <p>"What a strong method! Tianming is terrifyingly powerful!"</p>

  <p>"The power of Luo Zheng's sword attack was frightening enough, but Tianming actually withstood the sword light and charged straight forward without the slightest ounce of fear."</p>

  <p>"Tianming will definitely get the first place in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>At this rare moment, everyone in the universe had got the same answer.</p>

  <p>Even the mysterious girl had a look of disappointment on her face. "Luo Luo Zheng, quite frankly, I was hoping that you could take the first place. But Tianming got Chiyou's sword inheritance. His luck is better than yours.</p>

  <p>You probably won't be able to make it."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie quietly beheld the scene, and Mu Ning was also silent.</p>

  <p>They had never seen Luo Luo Zheng lose when he fought with the powerhouses at his realm.</p>

  <p>In this universe, Luo Luo Zheng was not even at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>And by chance, he would incidentally lose to Tianming in the end. The two women could not help but sigh in their hearts at the wonders of fate.</p>

  <p>Still, everyone was in awe observing Tianming's speed, which was incredibly fast as he made his way towards Luo Luo Zheng. The sword light of Luo Zheng's Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike split into two halves, subsequently slicing two ravines on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The two swords collided.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng had never been at a disadvantage when it came to his sword moves as his body was adept with the rhythm of the sword fight.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of his Mu Ning, he was far inferior.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly retreated a few steps sideways. With a twist of his sword, he began to charge up his second sword attack.</p>

  <p>Tianming's mind adamantly refused to give him another chance.</p>

  <p>Under the light, soft wavelike ripples spread out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng instinctively retreated his feet to the other side, but in that instant, countless bloody scars appeared on one of his arms.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's arm looked like it had been filed. His wounds appeared densely arranged. His blood outlined these wounds, and they strangely mimicked the wavelike ripples released by Tianming.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that Luo Zheng's body was a divine weapon, his arm would have already been shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>Tianming did not pause in the slightest as another ripple spread out.</p>

  <p>The speed was so swift that Luo Luo Zheng was left with no time to dodge at all.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>This time, it hit Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Sadly, Luo Luo Zheng looked extremely miserable now as numerous slashes were visible, from his face down to his neck.</p>

  <p>A drop of blood slowly dripped into Luo Zheng's eyes. If anyone could see closely, he or she would note there was a deep unwillingness in them.</p>
