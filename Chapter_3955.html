<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3955 Hawley </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Within the Flaming Maple Forest lay the Misty River race's territory— many of the people in the Three Purities Stage believed so.</p>

  <p>As did the young men like Larkin from the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>But as the Misty River race's leader, Wheeler was sure that this was false.</p>

  <p>After the former leader's death, Hawley designated Wheeler to the open position, telling him that the real master of the Flaming Maple Forest was the motionless Flaming Maple Trees, not the actual members of the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>These people were merely creatures living in the Flaming Maple Forest and everything they had obtained was bestowed upon them by the forest.</p>

  <p>If he found any chance to expand the Flaming Maple Forest, Wheeler would seize it without question.</p>

  <p>But expanding the Flaming Maple Forest was an extremely difficult task.</p>

  <p>On its south side lay the Heavenly Thunder Plain. If the Flaming Maple Forest extended to that plain, it would only turn to ashes under the powerful thunderbolts. On its east side was the cold land, a place unsuitable for trees to grow.</p>

  <p>The southwest side remained the most suitable area, meaning that it could expand along the Divine River to its upper reaches.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Flaming Maple Forest had also expanded in such a way, but at a certain point, it was discovered by the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The latter then poisoned the southwest soil, making the land toxic across twenty miles. The poisonous land was an insurmountable natural chasm for the Flaming Maple Forest— any seeds and roots instantly decayed once they drilled into the soil.</p>

  <p>When the Misty River race attempted to negotiate with the Element Spirit Civilization, they were refused. Since the last leader was killed, they figured that the latter would forbid the expansion of the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>Now that the Element Spirit Civilization took the initiative to mention so, Wheeler had no choice but to accept.</p>

  <p>Having seen through Wheeler's thoughts, Abner said nothing more and left.</p>

  <p>Standing up, Wheeler wiped his body dry and turned to Larkin. "I'm going to see Hawley."</p>

  <p>The Soul Interdicting Water on the bodies of Zheng, Yasamin, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi dried up and its effect disappeared, allowing the people to withdraw from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Flamine, Pearce, Auden and the other masters of the Oneness Sky Palace were all aware that it was a moment of great importance, so they waited aside. Elvinia, who had been cultivating, also came over.</p>

  <p>After waiting for so long, there was no news from the Other Shore. Of course, everyone was getting anxious.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng was the first to retreat from the Other Shore before waking up immediately.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, how is my father?"</p>

  <p>Elvinia asked, taking the first step forward. But as she spoke, Yasamin coughed twice from nearby and woke up as well, followed by Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"Madam Yasamin!"</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi..."</p>

  <p>"Father..."</p>

  <p>The strong warriors of the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain gathered around.</p>

  <p>Since Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were trapped, the Oneness Sky Palace lost their mainstay. Many believed that the two had no chance of ever waking up again.</p>

  <p>But now that the two had returned safe and sound, the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were all ecstatic.</p>

  <p>Both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin had been soaked in the Divine River for a long time, leaving them to suffer greatly. Coming back and seeing their families and subordinates safe and sound, they were all happy and excited.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace people were all looking forward to being taken back to the Bloom Divine Province by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Several elders of the Oneness Mountain proposed the idea immediately.</p>

  <p>The Bloom Divine Province served as a foundation for the Oneness Sky Palace. The cities at the foot of the seven mountains and by the Clear Lake were all closely linked to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>While the Pear Hill treated them very well, many of them still longed to return to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Eastern Emperor Taiyi refused the request for the time being.</p>

  <p>While they won the battle of the Pear Hill, the era was far from those in the past.</p>

  <p>Both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization had the means to descend to this world.</p>

  <p>The time when only one Eternal Realm warrior could protect an entire race was gone forever.</p>

  <p>If Eastern Emperor Taiyi brought his people back to the Bloom Divine Province, he might be unable to protect the Oneness Sky Palace and in turn destroy the Bloom Diving Province.</p>

  <p>Now the superpowers that supported the Finale Way were gathering in the Pear Hill. It merely wasn't the right time to return.</p>

  <p>After Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin had a brief meeting with the people from Oneness Sky Palace, they returned to the Other Shore again.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Maple Forest was clearly far from a safe place— the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and Zheng had been forcibly pulled to the Other Shore before, after all, so Zheng had to take them out of there at any cost.</p>

  <p>After everyone managed to return to the Other Shore, they followed Zheng.</p>

  <p>When moving across the open area by the Divine River, they could all feel a strong vibration from the ground. Huge creatures were surely approaching.</p>

  <p>"Squeak… It seems troublesome," said King Ienuan.</p>

  <p>It was well aware of the Misty River race's personality— it knew they would refuse to give up.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only Zheng and his companions that felt uneasy. The rest of the Eternal Realm warriors and the members of the alien races all seemed upset. The tremors from the ground indicated that the Misty River race made a great move.</p>

  <p>Soon, Abner appeared, a few nonhuman creatures following behind him.</p>

  <p>These warriors stared at Zheng as though they were looking upon a corpse.</p>

  <p>Abner, in particular, was wearing a strange smile as he proceeded.</p>

  <p>"I see they've found some powerful reinforcement," Zheng muttered to himself with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom...</p>

  <p>As the tremors grew closer, many members of Misty River race appeared, covered in bronze powder.</p>

  <p>Their race didn't have many people, and it seemed that most of them had already come.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang!</p>

  <p>With his black and cyan skin, Wheeler stood before Zheng showing no sign of contempt. Instead, his demeanor seemed ready for a negotiation. "You're no match for the Element Spirit Civilization," he said. "If you surrender obediently and leave the Flaming Maple Forest, you will not have to suffer any pain or trouble. I can also guarantee that these people will be safe and sound."</p>

  <p>He pointed at King Ieuan, Fuxi, and the rest as he spoke.</p>

  <p>To him, the conditions he just proposed were already very generous. If Zheng was sensible, he would agree.</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely curled his lips at the other. "Did the Element Spirit Civilization tell you to say that? They've said the same many times."</p>

  <p>Zheng figured that the power he used to kill Norris was enough to intimidate the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>His provocation made it impossible for the Misty River race to attack.</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility remained— the Element Spirit Civilization asked the Misty River race to make a move by promising them great benefits.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" Wheeler pressed again.</p>

  <p>"I've never compromised and I don't intend to do so now," Zheng said in return, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Regret washed over Wheeler's face. "Then you will never even get a chance to compromise. You'll die and lie in the Flaming Maple Forest forever, and your flesh and blood will become nourishment for the forest."</p>

  <p>"Can you kill me by yourself?" Zheng asked, his voice lowered.</p>

  <p>"That's too easy for Master Wheeler!"</p>

  <p>"If you die here, no one will bother to bury your body!"</p>

  <p>"When Master Wheeler tears you to pieces, you'll learn to not be so stubborn!"</p>

  <p>The crowd began clamoring upon witnessing Zheng's arrogance.</p>

  <p>But Wheeler merely shook his head and admitted, "I can't defeat you."</p>

  <p>The words had the rest of the Misty River race swallow their words and go silent. Even the rest of the Eternal Realm warriors and the many races in the forest's open space were rather surprised. It was a shock to hear Wheeler admit that he couldn't defeat this human being.</p>

  <p>But then Wheeler took a step back, as if to make way for something. "But he should be able to do that for me."</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>A great figure of over a hundred feet tall emerged from the forest. The man was dark all over, staring at Zheng, his eyes gleaming with ferocity.</p>
