<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield competition was finally over...</p>

  <p>The pictures that had appeared in the universe began to close and disappear gradually.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes again, he was in a trance. He felt as if he didn't belong to this world.</p>

  <p>The competition in the Illusion Battlefield had lasted less than three months, but during this period of time, many battles had occurred. Each battle was like a round of tempering, and it gave warriors new insights into strategies and skills.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, the entire universe was changing.</p>

  <p>The first of the many changes was the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>When some talents passed through the Hall of Causality, they chose to duplicate the supreme divine weapon in their hands. As a result, the rankings on the Spirit Tablet changed drastically.</p>

  <p>Originally, there were only three thousand supreme divine weapons, but now suddenly over a thousand more weapons were appearing. Clearly, all of these supreme divine weapons had been duplicated through the Hall of Causality...</p>

  <p>When the ray of light disappeared from Luo Zheng's body, three-colored dots of light suddenly appeared around him. These dots of light were like countless elves as they flew into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had absorbed these specks of light, his original Mu Ning intensified to a great degree. This was the reward from the second stage of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"He's back!"</p>

  <p>A slim figure ambled out from the inner courtyard. The person who was wearing a smile on her face was no other than Freya!</p>

  <p>After the end of the first stage, she had left the Illusion Battlefield and waited for a long time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng acknowledged her presence with a warm smile.</p>

  <p>He then turned his head in another direction and asked, "Why do you like to always hide?"</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice, Xun's slender frame floated into view from the other side. She was Luo Zheng's sword spirit, so naturally he could sense where she was.</p>

  <p>Xun seemed to be different now from what she was a few months ago.</p>

  <p>Right now she looked morose and dejected, which was an alien expression on her face. She had been an extremely powerful woman, but now she was depressed. Even so, this miserable expression also made her seem enchanting. Some people might even be attracted to her at the first sight.</p>

  <p>"What's your ranking?" Xun asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Freya was also concerned about this, so she looked towards Luo Luo Zheng with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had just returned, he must have entered the second stage.</p>

  <p>Freya could not see the picture of the Illusion Battlefield but she only knew that there were two stages there. Besides she had no idea that there was a bigger competition on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>"Guess!" Luo Luo Zheng asked mirthfully.</p>

  <p>Freya blinked her eyes. "You must have scored a rank in the top ten thousand!"</p>

  <p>Freya had entered the Illusion Battlefield and also witnessed all the powerful warriors in the universe. Just like those outstanding warriors, she, too, was at the Soul Sea Realm, but there was a huge gap between them. Any one of those powerful warriors in the main city could fight against the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors and yet this kind of warrior could not be considered truly powerful in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The one who scored a place among the top ten thousand warriors was extremely remarkable in Freya's eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wore a big smile on his face as he said, "You're right..."</p>

  <p>"Well? What on earth is your ranking?" Xun asked again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused with the change in Xun's attitude. It had only been a few months since he saw her, but her temperament seemed to have changed a lot.</p>

  <p>He replied, "I have won the first place."</p>

  <p>"The first place! Luo Luo Zheng, you... You..." Freya was extremely astonished.</p>

  <p>Freya considered Luo Luo Zheng to be a powerful warrior, but the fact that he would even be able to obtain the first place among all the Soul Sea Realm martial artists was far beyond her imagination!</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Xun's face. She was very satisfied with Luo Zheng's answer and gradually relief crept into her heart. She wanted to congratulate him, but no words came out.</p>

  <p>However, to her surprise, Luo Zheng's figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of her. Both their faces were extremely close.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked serious as he stared intently at Xun. "You don't seem to be in a good mood."</p>

  <p>He had felt that there was something wrong with Xun from the moment he laid eyes on her...</p>

  <p>Xun was a sword spirit, so she could not be ill, but she looked so weak and dispirited, which bothered Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Being conscious of the proximity of Luo Zheng's face to her, Xun couldn't help but step back and shake her head. "It's nothing..."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng revealed a mysterious smile. "Oh right. I have a gift for you!"</p>

  <p>"A gift?" Xun was slightly surprised, but she thought to herself that the Illusion Battlefield was just a world of illusion, so what could Luo Luo Zheng bring out of it?</p>

  <p>Naturally, she did not know that many warriors in the universe were paying close attention to the changes on the Spirit Tablet and the rankings of the supreme divine weapons. After the competition of the Illusion Battlefield, the number of supreme divine weapons had increased to over four thousand, but many first-rank divine weapons had been removed from the Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently tapped his space ring and two beams of light spilled out.</p>

  <p>Seeing the two beams of cold light, Xun frowned. When the two tips of the spear were thrust out, her jaw dropped!</p>

  <p>"Saint spear! You..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said he wanted to give her a gift, but Xun would never have expected that he would actually give her the Saint Killing Spear!</p>

  <p>After the initial shock subsided, she wracked her brains trying to figure out from where Luo Luo Zheng got the Saint Killing Spear!</p>

  <p>This Saint Killing Spear had been snatched away from her by Yao earlier...</p>

  <p>Could he have made a trip to the Demon Night, and grabbed the Saint Killing Spear right under Yao's nose?</p>

  <p>It was impossible!</p>

  <p>When Xun took the Saint Killing Spear from Luo Zheng's hand, the spear suddenly began to ring.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had acquired the Saint Killing Spear, he couldn't trigger it and make it ring. After all, Xun was its rightful owner...</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Xun shook it slightly and an enormous spear shadow formed.</p>

  <p>Shadowy Spin...</p>

  <p>This shadow was ten times more powerful than it was when Luo Luo Zheng unleashed it!</p>

  <p>Holding onto the saint spear, Xun spirits were lifted. She turned her head and asked in surprise, "How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood Xun's confusion, so he gave a brief summary of the story.</p>

  <p>This spear was naturally obtained from Malachi. He also spoke about Hailey as well as the situation of the Saint Spear Sect.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Xun's face became gloomy. She didn't expect the Saint Spear Sect episode to be so terrible.</p>

  <p>"So in other words, you're telling me that this spear is actually a duplicate!" Xun exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"Shoo!"</p>

  <p>A spear shadow was released by Xun...</p>

  <p>Wisps of killing intent were emitting from Xun's body. "I will surely make Yao pay the price for all evil things she has done!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Give me some time. I believe it won't take long..."</p>

  <p>Looking at Xun's murderous but perfect face, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the old Xun was back.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this state did not last for very long.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Xun had gone back to her sulking and floated silently behind Luo Luo Zheng, maintaining a certain distance from him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was perplexed once more, but he couldn't ask her what happened directly.</p>

  <p>After returning, he began to communicate with the cyan dragon in his mind, talking about all sorts of things he had seen and experienced in the Illusion Battlefield, as well as seeking answers to many doubts.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with Xun?"</p>

  <p>After talking with the cyan dragon for a short while, Luo Luo Zheng brought up Xun. He couldn't figure out what had happened during his long absence from the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Although the cyan dragon was concealed within Luo Zheng's body, he could not communicate with Luo Luo Zheng after he entered the Illusion Battlefield. During this period of time, he could only rest within Luo Zheng's mind. However, the cyan dragon could naturally observe everything outside of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's question, the cyan dragon chuckled but didn't answer. This further aggravated Luo Zheng's puzzlement.</p>

  <p>During this trip to the Illusion Battlefield, countless warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had accumulated their cultivation base after going through so many life and death experiences and used it to break through their bottlenecks!</p>

  <p>Countless Soul Sea Realm warriors had chosen to cultivate in seclusion at this moment. Luo Luo Zheng was no exception!</p>

  <p>In just a few days, a lot of big Heavenly Tribulations had appeared in countless supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>About thirty percent of the warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had reached the Spirit Supreme Realm. This kind of occurrence could not have happened in the past...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng spent a total of thirteen days being engrossed in closed-door cultivation.</p>

  <p>Several world lords from the Demon Night and the ogre race maintained their distance, guarding the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Thirteen days later, a giant tribulation cloud formed above them quietly!</p>

  <p>A world lord stared at the tribulation cloud, his eyes revealing a look of shock. "This is the Grand Meteorite Tribulation..." he gasped.</p>

  <p>"It seems that Luo Luo Zheng has broken through!"</p>

  <p>"It might be..."</p>

  <p>"It's time for us to leave as well..."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had already achieved first place in the Illusion Battlefield, he was destined to be the number one character in the world of chaos. His fate was linked to the rise and fall of the universe.</p>

  <p>Every race would hold out an olive branch to him. Thus it was meaningless for these world lords to guard Immortal Mansion.</p>
