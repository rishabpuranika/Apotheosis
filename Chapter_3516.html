<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though the members of the Tail Insect race could react quickly, Feng Ge launched an attack too suddenly that they could not retaliate.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the member of the race had no time to react before his head was pulled away from his body by Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Getting a glimpse of the green blood about to gush from the headless body, Feng Ge tossed it hundreds of feet away. It landed with a solid "boom" into the wall.</p>

  <p>She then tossed the head right to the ground like it was nothing. Her eyes were so dark, thirsty for murder. The other members of the Tail Insect race refused to even look her in the eye.</p>

  <p>"This... Princess Feng Ge, this..."</p>

  <p>Abdul and the other senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief could not believe their eyes.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, when they heard that Feng Ge had a corporeal body, they immediately knew that she could be a great advantage for the Oneness Sky Palace. However, she had just reached the fourteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. According to normal pace, her current strength was not supposed to be this powerful.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they all agreed that she shouldn't have gone out of her way to kill the member of the Tail Insect race.</p>

  <p>What Abdul feared was not the members of the Tail Insect race, but the force behind them.</p>

  <p>Her reckless move could just get them all into trouble.</p>

  <p>Abdul and others had no clue that Feng Ge had been holding back for so long. Her sudden course of action might have taken them by surprise, but they were not aware of what went on with her.</p>

  <p>If she were being reckless, she would have torn all the members of the Tail Insect race to pieces by now. They had insulted and disrespected the Oneness Sky Palace before, which made her even more angry.</p>

  <p>She was never one to show mercy, especially to weak creatures she despised. The creatures in the Dark Region were a prime example, and the Tail Insect race would have been no exception.</p>

  <p>If Zheng hadn't warned her to restrain her emotions, there was no telling what she would have done already.</p>

  <p>It was not until they had gone too far that she finally stood her ground.</p>

  <p>"You... How dare you kill our clansman?!" the leader of the Tail Insect race hissed, disgusted by what she had just done.</p>

  <p>He was not expecting a measly human to actually show any signs of resistance? especially like this.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng, Feng Ge smirked, "I think I want to get rid of more insects..."</p>

  <p>"Alright." Zheng nodded with a smile. "Just make sure you leave one alive."</p>

  <p>As soon as he gave the go signal, Feng Ge dashed in their direction, leaving streaks of light trailing behind her.</p>

  <p>At Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, there were no suitable clothes for her.</p>

  <p>Because of this, she was covered in clothing knitted from threads of light.</p>

  <p>That was why she resembled a shooting star as she ran at full speed.</p>

  <p>To the crowd, she was a flash of white light. Just then, the heads of the members of the Tail Insect race crashed into the sky, leaving only headless bodies behind.</p>

  <p>Within a couple of seconds, the bright light sped through the crowd, leaving only the leader of the Tail Insect race alive.</p>

  <p>He looked around, trying to process what had just happened. Just a moment ago, he had planned to fight back, but seeing Feng Ge's abilities left him trembling in his shoes. Nevertheless, he still stood his ground. "You've killed so many of our clansmen. There is no doubt that Master Ghost Scorpion..." He tried his best to appear fearless, though a drop of sweat trickled down his temple, "Master Ghost Scorpion will definitely kill you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng came out from behind, smiling. "Which is why I instructed her to keep you alive," he chuckled. "Go on, inform your Master Ghost Scorpion. I wonder how he plans to get rid of us."</p>

  <p>The lone member of the Tail Insect race was astonished to hear what Zheng said. He saw Zheng as too confident to care about the Tail Insect race or even their Master Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng seemed so willing to let go of him, he didn't dare speak another word. There was no way he wanted to die for no reason.</p>

  <p>Just as the survivor was about to walk away, Abdul gritted his teeth and said, "Well, I guess we should just kill them all at this point... Don't want to leave some that could cause future trouble!"</p>

  <p>It would be a big trouble that the members of the Tail Insect race had all died at a place of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, the Oneness Sky Palace could still deny it, and settle their actions with a large amount of soul pills at the worst. But if they allowed one member of the Tail Insect race to stay alive, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge gently rubbed her fingertips at the sound of Abdul's idea. To her, she didn't care about the insects one bit. She simply thought that they were too dirty, so she suddenly wanted to get a sword from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>She looked at Zheng, silently asking if they should follow through to kill the last member of the Tail Insect race.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, was not convinced. "Let him go," he said, walking away.</p>

  <p>The reason why he had allowed Feng Ge to kill them was because he wanted to intimidate the force behind the race.</p>

  <p>He didn't think it was a good idea to compromise, especially when their group was at a disadvantage. He didn't agree with Abdul's approach.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, but who the fuck are you? Are you trying to harm the Oneness Sky Palace?" Abdul slammed his palm on Zheng's chest, shouting at him and gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>He was knowledgeable of Tianxing's name from the Land of Sword Grief. But very little was known of his identity and his relation with the Oneness Sky Palace, so it was hard to tell if Tianxing was actually a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>For Abdul, offending creatures on the Other Shore would only put the Oneness Sky Palace in danger. He believed that he had every right to be angry.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook off Abdul's hand, and leaned in close, smiling. "My name is Zheng."</p>

  <p>The senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were stunned to hear his name. All their eyes widened and mouths opened.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the disciples who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm were stunned as well. They remembered that Zheng had been absent since his Soul of Light reached Stage Fourteen. Some people who had an inkling never dared to ask him. Now they were sure that "Tianxing" was in fact, Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for Chaim, he had already guessed it correctly before, so he was not at all surprised at the turn of events.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had unintentionally exposed some of his secrets in the Chaotic Source World. At this point, there was no need for him to hide this fact any longer, especially because it limited much of his actions. That was why now was the perfect time to reveal this secret.</p>

  <p>In front of the wooden building, Zheng suddenly turned around and patted his forehead. "By the way, make sure that insect gives back the jade and soul crystal he took from us just now."</p>

  <p>He winked at everyone, and then made his way into the wooden building, somewhat enjoying everyone's speechlessness.</p>

  <p>Nearly every super force had one or even several races on the Other Shore as their patron, and the Oneness Sky Palace was no exception.</p>

  <p>However, the race that was behind the Oneness Sky Palace was not very strong in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. This placed the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief in a very compromising position, a position of disadvantage. Over the past years, they had just been giving in. It was through this persistent perseverance that they were able to find a place to reside in. This was the main reason why they were unwilling to stay in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>With a sternness in his expression, Abdul did not fail to mention the current situation of the Oneness Sky Palace to Zheng. "What you are doing will make us unable to do anything on the Other Shore," he said harshly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how major races, like the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race, are treated in Stage Fourteen anyway," Zheng replied calmly, facing the already agitated Abdul.</p>

  <p>"Their patrons are all strong in Stage Fourteen, so they definitely have no threats on the Other Shore," Abdul responded impatiently. This brought about a sense of dismay among the senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>After all, they were all notable and outstanding members of the Oneness Sky Palace. None of them was willing to be bullied on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After being in deep thought, Zheng said with a smile, "If you always give in, the insects may only go further. And because we don't have a powerful patron behind us, that should be our number one priority right now."</p>

  <p>"Easy for you to say! Who would we even find to be our patron? Would you do it? Would you be our patron?" one of the senior disciples asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned his head and looked at Feng Ge, who was sitting calmly by his side. Her corporeal body of purified being had been carved to perfection, as it was a product of imagination. On top of that, she was full of charm and zest. Then, Zheng turned around and answered, "If we can't find a patron, we'll make one of our own."</p>
