<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, it took Zheng much effort to get a complete Spiritual Darkness.</p>

  <p>Now, looking at the gathering clouds, he was struck with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Sword cloud, condense!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed and a faint sword shadow suddenly appeared within the surging clouds and fog.</p>

  <p>It split into two, then four, and then finally, into eight parts.</p>

  <p>As the shadow spread, it suddenly turned into countless sword shadows.</p>

  <p>Their collisions produced the crisp sound of metal scraping against metal, constantly colliding in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>Something seemed to click in Lorena's mind as her eyes glowed. "I see...</p>

  <p>Holy Jay must have discovered the inheritance of my father in the Mountain of Holy Beings. The Infinity Ruler has also been obtained from there!"</p>

  <p>It hadn't been long since Holy Jay became a Holy Being, and Lorena wasn't aware of what happened after that.</p>

  <p>But when she saw Zheng practice the Emotion Closing Godly Way and absorb 3000 Godly Ways by means of the Infinity Ruler, she was almost certain that it was from her father's inheritance.</p>

  <p>Such inheritance could've only been taken from the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Guide was one of her father's most powerful theurgies.</p>

  <p>But it couldn't be activated even after comprehending the three thousand Godly Ways. The only way one could use it was through the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>And this was why the other 2999 Godly Ways worked as auxiliaries, and the Emotion Closing Godly Way remained the most important.</p>

  <p>Zheng had gotten the Infinity Ruler and it was quite the major when it came to cultivating the Emotion Closing Godly Way— it had to be more than a mere coincidence. It was likely that he obtained the Infinity Ruler while receiving a lesson as well.</p>

  <p>Putting together all the details, Lorena had a strong feeling about her speculations.</p>

  <p>In the inner world, all the living creatures raised their heads to gaze upon the dense sword clouds.</p>

  <p>This included the Evil God and all the various talents on the continent.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know how the sword clouds actually came into being, they knew that such an abnormality meant a great change in the world was nearing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>All the brown sword clouds gathered at the center of the inner world, completely surrounding Zheng's Godly Tile and gradually forming an enormous whirlpool.</p>

  <p>It swirled rapidly, gathering within the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Godly Tile continued expanding at great speed.</p>

  <p>In the midst of it all, a wisp of dazzling light suddenly appeared on the surface of the Godly Tile crystal.</p>

  <p>Not only did the main part of the Emotion Closing Godly Way expand, but the other variously colored parts of the Godly Tile also began expanding.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng was getting dizzy. He seemed to have comprehended hundreds of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler could absorb all the Godly Ways' internal momentum.</p>

  <p>And it was through the Infinity Ruler that Zheng had absorbed Joy's Purple Aura Godly Way. But he had no way to fully display it apart from the basic control skill, Separate Controlling.</p>

  <p>His cultivation level was still limited, after all.</p>

  <p>There was no restriction to the Godly Tile when it came to the first three levels of the Godly Ways. It was the latter three levels that had requirements for the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had absorbed the Godly Ways, his low-rank True God status prevented him from using the latter three levels of the Godly Ways. But now that he had broken through the bottleneck and instantly understood hundreds of Godly Ways, he was possibly the most powerful being in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"I have broken through," Zheng said as his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>After the expansion of the Godly Tile, Zheng's sudden comprehension immediately let him obtain a new level of understanding of the Godly Ways. It brought such a wonderful and relaxed feeling.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng officially became a mid-rank True God... his entire inner world began shaking.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>A thousand and eighty golden Sanskrit words around his inner world released countless rays of golden light.</p>

  <p>"My inner world is expanding once again!" Zheng was utterly stunned.</p>

  <p>A strong sense of tearing could be felt in his belly and Zheng was trying his best to push it away.</p>

  <p>Even though he was an incarnation in his inner world, he could still clearly sense everything in his body, no matter how subtle.</p>

  <p>The continent in Zheng's inner world began floating again. Huge waves were appearing in the chaotic sea, continuously changing directions.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words kept pushing into the edge of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Ten miles...</p>

  <p>Thousands of miles...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand miles...</p>

  <p>A million miles...</p>

  <p>In such a short period of time, Zheng's inner world had expanded over ten times.</p>

  <p>Seven continents lay in Zheng's inner world, like seven small islands in the middle of the broad chaotic sea. The distance between each continent continued growing further.</p>

  <p>Under the vibration of the inner world, a new continent rose from the chaotic sea and was formed.</p>

  <p>Once it was complete, it turned out three times larger than the total area of the seven continents combined.</p>

  <p>Though the chaotic sea was a place where living beings were born, these continents were the place where they grew and lived prosperously.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, in the near future, an even more brilliant kingdom was to appear on the continent to produce many more talents and strong warriors.</p>

  <p>Having absorbed quite a number of Spiritual Darknesses, Zheng finally made a breakthrough into becoming a mid-rank True God. But he wasn't stopping there.</p>

  <p>His inner world's consciousness still longed for the Spiritual Darknesses, so naturally, Zheng wasn't going to refuse the chance to absorb them all.</p>

  <p>He was stuck being a low-rank True God for so long, after all. If there were enough Spiritual Darknesses for him to absorb, he would have broken through to the mid-rank True God much earlier.</p>

  <p>"Mother, how many Spiritual Darknesses are there?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Lorena said, "Zheng, you can just absorb them!"</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had consumed far more Spiritual Darknesses than others had when opening the Thousand Sanskrit Land, to Lorena, it wasn't anything special. After all, Zheng only wanted to make a breakthrough and become a mid-rank True God or perhaps even a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Hearing his mother's words, Zheng heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>In the cave, the Spiritual Darknesses were still gathering from all directions, rushing into Zheng's inner world and falling into the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The waters of the chaotic sea began boiling as more and more dark clouds and mist spread into the sky.</p>

  <p>And so Zheng made use of these elements as means to try and become a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>In the East Hall on a Floating Island…</p>

  <p>Nicholas stood there along with Jeremiah, Murphy, Clark, and the others.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings gathering there belonged to the alliance of the rich and powerful clans led by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had never had to endure anything. To him, only the weak had to endure all kinds of things in life.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had offended the Dongfang Clan and he was dead-intent on counterattacking without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Ten divine eras ago, I said that the day would come sooner or later. Are you guys ready, now?" Nicholas' tone was cold.</p>

  <p>"I obey all your command. I shall do anything you decide!" The Holy Being from the Liu Clan answered promptly.</p>

  <p>Because they were considered rather weak among the rich and powerful clans, the Liu Clan was more than willing to suck up to and take advantage of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"Our Tang Clan supports you, of course. But can you ensure a smooth process?" Clark asked skeptically.</p>

  <p>With a small smile, Nicholas was ready to answer.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a small voice suddenly came to his mind, changing his expression entirely. He abruptly screamed out, "Everyone, would you give me a moment of your time?"</p>
