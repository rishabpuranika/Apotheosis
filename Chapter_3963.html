<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>One of the charred black limbs was a leg and the other was an arm.</p>

  <p>The members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors were stunned, their breaths quickening, as these limbs appeared on the surface of the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Hawley devoured a scorched limb, which everyone in the Flaming Maple Forest knew about. Many warriors of various races maintained that this was the reason why Hawley was so powerful.</p>

  <p>When these warriors were looking for all sorts of strange treasures in the Divine River, they naturally hoped to get lucky enough to lay hands on the charred limbs one day.</p>

  <p>To everyone's disappointment, no one had gotten a second charred limb across the years.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that two black limbs were hidden in the Flaming Maple Forest!</p>

  <p>The roots of the Flaming Maple Trees were strong, and both sides of the Divine River were covered with these trees. Everything that happened in the Divine River would be under the control of the Flaming Maple Forest, so it was easy for the Flaming Maple Forest to obtain anything from the Divine River.</p>

  <p>"Once the black limb is devoured, one's physical strength will increase by leaps and bounds!"</p>

  <p>"It can make me stronger than Hawley!"</p>

  <p>"This is our race's sacred object!"</p>

  <p>The crowd was now extremely excited.</p>

  <p>One's strength could increase to an unimaginable level after they obtained a black limb. This temptation was so strong that it astonished the Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Maple Forest had probably sensed that many warriors from various races were about to make a move. Branches covered in maple leaves surrounded the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race, the maple leaves flashing the red light.</p>

  <p>This was a serious warning.</p>

  <p>Several warriors saw the red maple leaves and subconsciously came to a halt.</p>

  <p>They didn't forget that they were in the Flaming Maple Forest, and knew what would happen if they were attacked by these maple leaves.</p>

  <p>But more warriors wished for good luck. They believed that as long as they didn't use their energy, the Flaming Maple Forest wouldn't attack them. And if they were lucky enough to grab the black limbs, the benefits would be obvious enough.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The warriors swarmed towards the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you rob us?"</p>

  <p>The faces of the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race darkened.</p>

  <p>These two races were powerful in the Flaming Maple Forest, but they were under immense pressure in the face of the riot that so many warriors were staging.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the front had barely approached them when the red maple leaves fell off the branches.</p>

  <p>Before this, the maple leaves had flown in a rather relaxed manner towards their targets. The red maple leaves, however, were completely different.</p>

  <p>They were like sharp arrows shooting towards the people approaching them.</p>

  <p>"That's not a long distance," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The length of the invisible route determined the time it would take for the maple leaves to approach the target.</p>

  <p>The maple leaves exploded rapidly in this short route.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>The warriors of different races who were at the front of the approaching horde were smashed into pieces by the maple leaves.</p>

  <p>When the remaining warriors watched the warriors in front of them meet this miserable end, they became frightened and realized the cruel reality that awaited them.</p>

  <p>They'd be courting death if they continued on like this. Once they figured this out, all of them began to retreat. The members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race remained nervous for a while.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess seemed to realize something as she watched this scene unfold. "It looks like the Flaming Maple Forest is the real owner of this place. The Misty River race doesn't have the ability to control the Flaming Maple Forest. Hawley was just a helper chosen by the Flaming Maple Forest."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan were stunned at first, but soon realized that the Snake Goddess was right. The black limb that Hawley had eaten before had probably been given to him by the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>"So the Flaming Maple Forest has now chosen the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race at the same time, right?" Fuxi asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"I think so." The Snake Goddess smiled. "Luo Zheng has easily killed Hawley, which might have brought a lot of pressure on the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>The forest will, as a result, expand its team."</p>

  <p>"It wants to expand its team just to deal with me?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"What will the Flaming Maple Forest do if I grab a black limb?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had barely finished talking when the three Flaming Maple Trees close by suddenly bent down to Luo Zheng, stretching out their branches as if in obeisance. The maple leaves on the branches flickered with the green light.</p>

  <p>This was a sign that the Flaming Maple Forest was actually showing him kindness.</p>

  <p>The forest was afraid that Luo Zheng would really fight for the black limbs.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the only person the Flaming Maple Forest could do nothing to.</p>

  <p>"It is just a casual suggestion," Luo Zheng said, shrugging.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't stay in the Flaming Maple Forest for a long time. What was more, he had no interest in the Flaming Maple Forest or the Divine River.</p>

  <p>"However, the black limb can greatly strengthen the physical body. I don't need it but..." Luo Zheng said, eyes narrowed and a smirk on his face.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Ying, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan were all shocked at Luo Zheng's words. If their bodies were strengthened to be as powerful as Hawley's, their strength would also increase greatly.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race were also paying attention to what was happening here, their faces deathly pale.</p>

  <p>They weren't afraid of other warriors coming to snatch the limbs. But they couldn't escape or resist if Luo Zheng came for them. They would have no choice but to surrender.</p>

  <p>The black limbs were related to the races' fate. How could they let others take them away?</p>

  <p>However, before Luo Zheng could finish talking, the Divine River beside him began to churn violently.</p>

  <p>Countless stems lifted the items at the bottom of the Divine River. Among them were Gold and Silver Bones flickering with two types of lights, azure blue crystals, and dazzlingly shiny thin clothes...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that these things were very valuable. And though they were not as valuable as the charred black limbs, they were still a huge fortune for the warriors of various races in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, were interested in them.</p>

  <p>"This fortune is too much!" King Ieuan was good at calculating the value of items. With just a glance, it was able to roughly determine the value of this pile.</p>

  <p>Wheeler didn't relax. He knew that although this pile was large, the combined value of these items was not as high as that of the black limbs.</p>

  <p>What if Luo Zheng didn't give up on the black limbs?</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Flaming Maple Forest knew this, which was probably why one of the maple trees suddenly stretched out a branch and began to write on the ground. "The Eternal Realm warrior can't absorb the charred corpse and will die after swallowing it. You can try if you don't believe me."</p>

  <p>These words disappointed Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others, forcing them to give up their fantasy.</p>

  <p>There was a clear distinction between the Eternal Realm warriors and the other creatures. The latter were Other Shore creatures born in the Three Purities Stage, while the Eternal Realm warriors had arrived there through the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>With a noncommittal look on his face, Luo Zheng asked, "What is the story behind the charred corpse?"</p>

  <p>One could strengthen their body to a terrifying extent by swallowing the black limbs. The charred corpse must have been extremely powerful when it was alive; even its backstory was probably extraordinary.</p>
