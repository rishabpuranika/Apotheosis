<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the blood man's explanation, Zheng soon understood. He smiled and paraphrased, "So, all the creatures of the main world have been downgraded..."</p>

  <p>All members from the Four Spirits Sect had perished in the chaos, and they had all been transformed into Treacherous Beings. In theory, they had all been downgraded to creatures of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The blood man stared disdainfully at Zheng as he continued to clarify, "It's not just the creatures that have been downgraded, but also the entire main world."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Zheng was almost dumbstruck. "The entire main world has been downgraded? How is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>"Why would it be impossible?" The blood man added in a nonchalant voice, "The chaos emerged from the downgrade of the main world. The so-called world builders knew the method of downgrade, and they unfolded a portion of the main world. That was how they created secondary worlds."</p>

  <p>"They unfolded a portion of the main world..." Zheng's eyes were like saucers with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Campbell had never made any mention of such things to him before.</p>

  <p>He was only aware that the world builders were responsible for constructing secondary worlds and extracting energies from the secondary worlds through the four pillars.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, they didn't know that once the downgrade had begun, there would be no turning back. Sooner or later, the entire main world would be downgraded," the blood man explained.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so confident of these things?" Zheng queried.</p>

  <p>Ziya had been in the Abstruse Energy World for a very long time, and Geoffrey could adapt to the environment of the main world. Moreover, Zheng knew there were still creatures living within the main world, such as Pompeo's kin.</p>

  <p>The blood man leaned closer to Zheng and whispered with a smile, "Because the main world was also birthed from downgrade. The entire main world is an unfolded section from a higher-level world..."</p>

  <p>This unexpected information struck Zheng silent.</p>

  <p>For a moment, he was utterly speechless.</p>

  <p>The main world was already vastly beyond his comprehension. What could a world at a higher level than the main world be? The gears in his mind were spinning as he tried to imagine this!</p>

  <p>The blood man had already anticipated Zheng's reaction. He rocked back in his chair and explained in a lazy voice, "In fact, you've already heard of that higher-level world. It's known as the Deep Space among the Four Spirits Sect."</p>

  <p>"You came from the Deep Space."</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as realization flared in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had read about the Deep Space in the stone tablets of the Monkey Spirit Sect, and he memorized the most relevant information pretty well.</p>

  <p>Among the Four Spirits Sect, the Deep Space was seen as the origin of everything. For instance, the ancestry-level bloodline also originated from the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>"You're right." The blood man nodded his head sagely. "The Deep Space is what the Four Spirits Sect named it. In truth, it is called the Stellar World, and it is a fifth-grade world. A long time ago, a part of the Stellar World was downgraded, and it became the so-called main world. The main world is actually called the Grand Lower World."</p>

  <p>"That means our world..."</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could finish speaking, the blood man answered his unspoken question, "It is a third-grade world, the Lower Extreme World. It's a world of energy diversification. Every time a world is downgraded, different kinds of its energy diversify and split up. A sixth-grade world has eighty-six kinds of energy. A fifth-grade world has one hundred and forty kinds, and a fourth-grade world has three hundred and seventy-three kinds..."</p>

  <p>Three hundred and seventy-three... Zheng knew this number intimately. That was the exact number of all the abilities contained in the ancestry-level bloodline's four quadrants.</p>

  <p>"What about a third-grade world? Could it be— " Zheng was thinking of another number.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand and one," the blood man said, instantly seeing where Zheng's mind was going. "There are a total of three thousand and one types of energy in this world."</p>

  <p>Zheng stared straight at the blood man and sensed the vigor of the bloodline power surging throughout his body. He couldn't restrain himself and remarked with pity, "Although the energy has varied greatly, their power became weakened at the same time."</p>

  <p>The power of the Godly Ways could never match up to the power of the bloodlines that originated from the ancestry-level bloodline. In fact, they couldn't even hold a candle to the Other Shore Tokens, let alone the bloodlines. The only exception had been the powerful Ways-blending Energy that emerged when the Evil God had merged all of the Godly Ways together.</p>

  <p>"There is a heavy cost involved in downgrade," the blood man continued.</p>

  <p>"Then why would the Four Spirits Sect have chosen to downgrade their world?" Zheng blurted out in confusion.</p>

  <p>"They were deceived," the blood man simply stated.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Zheng was startled. He would never have seen this answer coming.</p>

  <p>"The entire Four Spirits Sect has been lied to. Downgrade is a highly dangerous act," the blood man said.</p>

  <p>"What danger does it involve?" Zheng's interest was burning with curiosity now.</p>

  <p>Even though the energy had been greatly weakened, everyone seemed to live and go about their business.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were now considered to be indestructible.</p>

  <p>The blood man once again looked down at Zheng with an aloof gaze as he said, "Since a world can be downgraded from the fifth grade to the fourth grade, and from the fourth grade to the third grade, then it's possible that it can also be further downgraded from the third grade, becoming a second-grade world."</p>

  <p>"A second-grade world..." Zheng felt a sense of foreboding fill him, and his face darkened.</p>

  <p>"You don't need me to paint you a picture. You have visited similar worlds," the blood man explained.</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Scroll Painting," Zheng confidently replied.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the blood man grimly nodded.</p>

  <p>The strange experience in the Eternal Scroll Painting had left a grim impression on Zheng. He had been completely transformed into a two-dimensional figure like a painting, and moving had been a task of great difficulty.</p>

  <p>"You were not completely downgraded when you turned into a part of the Eternal Scroll Painting. You could still escape from the painting and observe everything around you. Once the world is completely downgraded, all you would see will be lines of different lengths, and you wouldn't be able to distinguish one thing from the next..." the blood man explained. "The types of energy will increase, becoming less mighty, from three thousand and one to eight hundred and thirty thousand."</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to envision the second-grade world as described by the blood man, and he couldn't help but shudder at the thought.</p>

  <p>Although there would be many more kinds of energy, one would only be able to see lines there! What a boring world it would be?</p>

  <p>"Everything has been hazy since I left the Deep Space. Many of my past memories about the Deep Space are now lost. I can't even recall who I was or where I came from, but I still remember my one true mission, which is to prevent the world from being downgraded," the blood man said resolutely.</p>

  <p>"However, the downgrade has already begun, and the entire Four Spirits Sect has become involved. I couldn't tell who is really behind the downgrade, so I had to watch everything in silence.</p>

  <p>I couldn't trust you then because you might also be the downgrader."</p>

  <p>The "Zheng" transformed from the ancestry-level bloodline became pensive and gazed thoughtfully ahead. From where he stood, no one was trustworthy, including Zheng.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, world builders like Campbell could be seen as enemies of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"How could I be the downgrader?" Zheng rolled his eyes at the blood man.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, it must be the Snake Spirit King. After all, he deceived the three other kings into entering the chaos and killed them all."</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit King is the most probable suspect, but the Bird Spirit King also holds a dubious distinction and so does the missing Human Spirit King..." The blood man's face became grave as he said, "I can offer you all my help, but you have to assist me by finding and killing the downgrader, even if that person is Kincaid, the Human Spirit King."</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated for a brief moment, but the determination burned in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He didn't know why the world had been downgraded, but he knew without any doubt that if it continued like this, everyone would be doomed.</p>

  <p>This would be much more terrifying than the collapse of the chaos.</p>

  <p>If there really was a downgrader, Zheng would use all of his skills to kill that person. He wouldn't hesitate, even if his opponent was Kincaid, the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"I will find and kill the downgrader. I swear to you," Zheng pledged solemnly.</p>

  <p>The blood man smiled, and then he was transformed into the original form of the ancestry-level bloodline. "Then, my power is now yours..."</p>
