<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Cecil who could sense the change of airflow as it occurred understood that he would need to move along with the eye of the cyclone to assure his safety. If not, he would be hurt by the wind blades as well.</p>

  <p>As light as a swallow, Luo Zheng had been brought to the sky by the cyclone.</p>

  <p>He let the turbulent airflow propel him, and drifted with the wind.</p>

  <p>Although Cecil's wind blades were quite sharp, they were inferior to James' sword energy.</p>

  <p>James had condensed a ton of dreadful sword intent into his sword energy. If Luo Zheng were struck by his sword energy, it was no doubt that he would be cut in half. Luo Zheng had no hope to fight against James's sword energy unless he upgraded his body to the level of a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>What was more, Cecil's cultivation method was not quite suitable for a one-on-one challenge. Instead, if he were fighting on a battlefield, his Twins Chaos Cyclone might have played a significant role, because the range of the Twins Chaos Cyclone was large and it would destroy all combatants sucked into it.</p>

  <p>To be frank, none of the members of the Zhuge Clan were good at fighting alone. Among the many cultivation methods passed from one generation to another within the Zhuge Clan, loads of them were on military strategy and tactics, as well as famous military formations. That was why the Zhuge Clan often dispatched their members to the Imperial Army as counselors. They were born to lead troops.</p>

  <p>Thus, even if the wind blades cut Zheng's robe, they did not have the power to penetrate his spiritual weapon-like body.</p>

  <p>Gusts of violent wind carried Luo Zheng in the air. He was like a butterfly fluttering along with the wind and rain. Some thought he looked like a small boat rocked by a storm and frequently got swept away by huge tides but instantly steadied itself.</p>

  <p>Quite a few people were anxious as they watched Luo Zheng. Sweat beaded their foreheads as they worried about his safety.</p>

  <p>The All Peaks Competition, after all, was a contest designed to test the strength of disciples.</p>

  <p>Very few would put up a desperate fight when they were still in the group stage unless they were contending for the top 50.</p>

  <p>It would not matter if one lost one or two matches during the group stage. As long as they did not get eliminated, their goal was fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Some disciples would even go so far as to hide their real strength. Even if they went head-on with a much stronger opponent, to conceal their real power, they would often admit defeat on purpose to avoid exposing their ace cards too soon.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, it was not wise to doggedly pursue a win during the group stage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was an outlier. He would never admit defeat. Over time, Luo Zheng had gained a better understanding of his martial arts capability.</p>

  <p>'To reach the top rank in martial arts, I cannot use tricks. Even when I know that there are thistles and thorns ahead, I should grit my teeth and power through instead of sidestepping them.</p>

  <p>Though it's fine to sidestep a difficulty, my aspiration will fade if I continued to do that. What's worse is that I won't advance on the road of practicing martial arts. Since I am determined to head far down this road, I must not cheat. No matter what my challenge, I will march forward with gritted teeth!'</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng wanted to test his limits and push himself for the sake of his growth, what forced Cecil to the extreme was the enmity between Luo Zheng and his family. 'Killing Luo Zheng during this match would be perfect!'</p>

  <p>Spurred by their motives, the moment Cecil and Luo Zheng faced each other, they began a life-and-death combat!</p>

  <p>As the cyclone in the arena grew stronger and stronger, the airflow also grew intensive. All kinds of odd-shaped blades clashed with each other, before ricocheting in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Thump..."</p>

  <p>A wind blade flew right toward Luo Zheng. It cut through his robe and sank into his flesh.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a muffled snort, but his heart leaped with joy— the wind blade could not harm him. It left a shallow scratch on his body, but it did not harm him severely. The impact of the wind blade, however, stimulated the warm currents, which in turn, started to cleanse his corporeal body.</p>

  <p>'Now that these wind blades can't hurt me, I don't need to avoid them.</p>

  <p>Instead, I can let them strike me!'</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng had tried to curl as much as possible to avoid the blades. But now, he stretched out his arms and legs in the air.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is in luck. He has managed to not be hit by a wind blade until now.</p>

  <p>But, I'm afraid injury from this one collision will not be easy to bear!</p>

  <p>The blade probably severed his bowels!"</p>

  <p>"Well, given the immense power of the Twins Chaos Cyclone, he is really, really lucky for not being minced yet. But this blow is the first of many. With a few more accidental hits like this, he will be mangled..."</p>

  <p>"Why hasn't he surrendered? If I were him, I would have given up a long time ago. While there is life, there is hope. Even if I lose this year's All Peaks Competition, I can try again in three years. Regardless of this guy's strength, he is definitely a lunatic!"</p>

  <p>As the disciples murmured between themselves, a huge wind blade suddenly flew in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>Imagining the damage the massive wind blade would do to Luo Zheng, many female disciples began shrieking.</p>

  <p>The battle referee looked grave, and his complexion paled. According to the rules of the arena, only when Luo Zheng admitted defeat would the referee be able to rescue Luo Zheng. Now, with the wind blade about to hit Luo Zheng, he anxiously waited for Luo Zheng to shout "I give up!"</p>

  <p>However, to the referee's surprise, Luo Zheng would rather collide with the wind blade than surrender!</p>
