</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Life Vitality Strike exerted by the broken sword was not the fully complete version.</p>

  <p>If this sword had been at its peak, it would have been able to form both negative and positive energies. With the negative and positive energies as its foundation, it would easily have formed a chaotic hole, and grey light formed from the condensed chaotic energy would have been born from the chaotic hole.</p>

  <p>However, since the sword was damaged, its power had already plateaued at its lowest point, not to mention that its owner was a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>In the end, the sword took control as a sentient weapon, and it resolutely came up with an alternative plan.</p>

  <p>And that was to use the Metal Law as a base to replace the chaotic hole.</p>

  <p>However, the Metal Law was still a much weaker source of energy.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike was a far cry from what it used to be.</p>

  <p>However, it was still strong enough to easily destroy Luo Luo Zheng, like stepping on an ant.</p>

  <p>Even the True Gods feared chaotic energy. Despite the strike having been weakened countless times, how could a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior hope to withstand it?</p>

  <p>However, the broken sword had borne witness to such an incredible scene.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's spear was raised and poised for the attack, it similarly used the Metal Law as the base to condense a grey light.</p>

  <p>Chaotic Life Vitality Strike?</p>

  <p>The Metal Law at the tip of the spear was a mere presence and was hardly worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>But what was the grey light?</p>

  <p>Chaos?</p>

  <p>The broken sword had traveled down from the divine land, so it naturally knew how terrifying chaotic energy could be.</p>

  <p>All things were returned to the chaos, which also formed both the foundation and the tomb of all living beings. Even now, warriors had yet to thoroughly study and comprehend the mysteries of the chaos.</p>

  <p>In order to use the power of chaotic energy, the True Gods in the divine land had spent countless years researching it, but had all come up empty-handed.</p>

  <p>However, one of the divine-level weapon refiners found a completely different approach.</p>

  <p>He had departed from the path of using primordial energy to refine weapons, and instead began to use chaotic energy to refine weapons.</p>

  <p>Thus, a new path of weapon refining appeared in the universe. From then on, weapon refining was divided into two great paths, and there were also two different kinds of weapons being developed. One was the supreme primordial weapons, while the other was the supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>Only supreme chaotic weapons could directly channel chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>'This guy is a mere human. He is only a junior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>How could he possibly harness chaotic energy?' thought the broken sword. The shock it felt was beyond description.</p>

  <p>It had been purely coincidental that Luo Luo Zheng had been able to master the Primal Chaos Technique back then.</p>

  <p>Actually, the reason why Luo Zheng's master had created the Primal Chaos Technique in the first place, was that he had become enlightened by the refining method of supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's master wasn't the only one who spent time contemplating this in the divine land.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, to use chaotic energy to further your cultivation, what you needed to do was convert chaotic energy into life vitality.</p>

  <p>When a warrior used life vitality to cultivate, their inner world would be created in their belly. However, this inner world was formed purely from life vitality. The moment the living beings within the inner world left the warrior's body, they would have to reform into life vitality and dissipate.</p>

  <p>Chaotic energy, however, was a pure energy which was the origin of all living things, so the inner world built from chaos would be a real world.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had come to this same conclusion, though they had yet to see it in practice.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that although all sorts of strange bodies existed in the universe, there was no physical form that could contain chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The only things that could contain chaotic energy were certain special weapons. For example, that broken sword in Lone's hand.</p>

  <p>Hence, creating a technique like the Primal Chaos Technique was useless, because no one was able to fuel the chaotic energy needed to cultivate it.</p>

  <p>It was the equivalent of creating a peerless arrow, but there was no bow capable of shooting such an arrow.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's master had been knowledgeable in everything. In the end, he still managed to create the Primal Chaos Technique, which was like the peerless arrow and then he encountered Luo Luo Zheng, the special bow capable of shooting the special arrow. As a result, Luo Luo Zheng became the first person to control the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Such a coincidence was something that Luo Zheng's master had never considered, nor could he have planned for this miraculous eventuality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng himself was oblivious about all this.</p>

  <p>At this moment, as Luo Zheng's thoughts cleared, he began to use a similar method to copy Lone's Chaotic Life Vitality Strike, and he released it through the spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>This move had been activated by the Metal Law. Thus, it couldn't be called the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike; it could only be called the Chaotic Metal Law Strike. However, what it was called wasn't important. What was important was the power contained in the strike.</p>

  <p>The Metal Law was not strong enough to deal with Lone.</p>

  <p>However, the chaotic energy within Luo Zheng's body was much more solid than that of the broken sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>A golden light began emitting from the glowing tip of the Saint Killing Spear, constantly radiating forth.</p>

  <p>The broken sword, however, was not afraid of the golden light.</p>

  <p>Back in the Hall of Causality, it had helped Lone withstand the corrosion triggered by the heavenly rules, and it was able to protect him then.</p>

  <p>However, the grey light contained within the golden light made the broken sword's mind tremble.</p>

  <p>The grey light from Lone's sword intersected with the grey light from Luo Zheng's spear in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Luo Zheng's placid face.</p>

  <p>There was another characteristic to his chaotic energy, which had originated with Luo Luo Zheng himself? devouring.</p>

  <p>The moment the two grey lights met, both the onlookers and the Godly Geniuses watching noticed that Lone's grey light began to shrink, while Luo Zheng's began to expand rapidly.</p>

  <p>While that happened, Luo Zheng's grey light streaked towards Lone.</p>

  <p>The broken sword was filled with questions and hesitation. It had completely sealed off Lone's soul, effectively taking control over his body in all aspects.</p>

  <p>Facing Luo Luo Zheng, it felt a great sense of impending doom, and could not afford to be distracted at all.</p>

  <p>However, even though it knew that it couldn't afford to be distracted, it still couldn't help but ponder over the reason why Luo Luo Zheng, a mere mortal, possessed the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation method might not have caused a stir in the universe; however, that was because most warriors in the universe were unaware of the true value of chaotic energy and lacked the experience to use it.</p>

  <p>But if they had been in the divine land, it would probably have caused the True Gods to discuss this impossibility among themselves.</p>

  <p>The research on life vitality had already reached its peak in the divine land. There was no possibility of progressing by even an inch more.</p>

  <p>However, the True Gods of the divine land didn't know much about chaotic energy. If Luo Luo Zheng could really use chaotic energy, it would bring about a great revolutionary change in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the broken sword didn't recognize Luo Zheng's divine weapon body.</p>

  <p>After stepping into the divine weapon, Luo Zheng's body had become more and more complete, and he was able to hide the weapon Mu Ning from the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Even if the Primal Chaos Technique spread throughout the entire divine land, most likely no one would be strong enough to be able to cultivate it.</p>

  <p>On the Heaven Earth Board, the situation the two of them were in was completely reversed.</p>

  <p>Lone had used his sword to chase after Luo Luo Zheng, eventually cornering him on the board.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to perish, in that instant, the situation was completely reversed. Now, it was Luo Luo Zheng who was chasing down Lone.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is also controlling the chaos! Amazing! What exactly happened to him?" mumbled the old leader of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>The broken sword had believed that no warriors in the universe would have the skill to recognize the chaotic energy, but it had underestimated the warriors in the universe.</p>

  <p>In the universe, other than the supreme divine weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet, there were also some treasures that had surpassed even these, and they had yet to be ranked.</p>

  <p>The heavens could no longer use the normal rules to investigate the existence of these treasures, while the Universe Spirit Tablet relied on a special Law of Causality to collect the rankings of all these treasures and even rank them.</p>

  <p>In the universe, besides the broken sword, there were still two supreme chaotic weapons and two supreme primordial weapons. Somehow, one of the supreme chaotic weapons had ended up in the hands of the old leader of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>From the moment that Lone had stabbed out with the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike, some Supreme Lords had begun to pay special attention to that broken sword. Before this, they had never imagined that this broken sword could actually be a supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>What they had never anticipated was that the last thrust by Luo Zheng's spear also contained the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors wouldn't be able to perceive the mystery behind the events of the fight. They just saw that Luo Luo Zheng suddenly displayed his strength and chased after Lone. It turned out he would turn the tables and win the battle.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't understand at all why Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly been able to turn the tables and reversed the situation.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were able to understand what was going on. Yet, being able to understand what was going on did not mean that they could understand the reason behind this. Just like Lone's broken sword, they had no idea where Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>'Could it be that within his body, there's a chaotic sea?'</p>

  <p>This thought flashed through the mind of Supreme Lord of Original Sin, who was the leader of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>This speculation was quite accurate, but it seemed extremely unreasonable. How could Luo Luo Zheng possess a chaotic sea?</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait..."</p>

  <p>Lone kept retreating, and suddenly spoke up. From the looks of it, he seemed to be giving up on resisting.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held his spear at the ready as he stared coldly at Lone. "What do you want to say?"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the chaotic energy you're using?" Lone could not help but ask. At this moment, his soul had already been completely sealed, so it was in fact the broken sword that was speaking through his lips.</p>
