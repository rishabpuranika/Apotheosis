  <p>Tribulation was harsh. Not everyone was lucky enough to survive it, so it was rare for a warrior to continuously undergo it.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng himself hadn't thought that he could trigger five consecutive small Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his physical body had advanced once again. With his unimaginably strong luck, it wasn't that hard for him to deal with the tribulations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation had rapidly increased after experiencing the Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>He was currently a warrior at the tenth level of the Life and Death Realm already.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the Life and Death Realm didn't have a tenth level. It was because once someone had entered the sixth level of the Life and Death Realm, their life vitality would liquefy continuously. The longer this process took, the more perfect the Soul Sea formed inside their body would be.</p>

  <p>After the warriors reached the tenth level of the Life and Death Realm, their life vitality would quickly liquefy and form a flawless Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>This meant that they actually had reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's situation was a bit special.</p>

  <p>Layla's and Javier's elixir fields were naturally evolving into their Soul Seas.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had also attempted to check his own elixir field after he passed the tenth level of the Life and Death Realm. He wanted to see if the chaotic energy inside him had successfully evolved into his Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's master had taught him the Primal Chaos Technique, his master had deduced that since the chaotic energy was the essence that formed the universe, it should also be able to form the Soul Sea. But different from the sea of life vitality, the Soul Sea created by chaotic energy would be a true world.</p>

  <p>A warrior could gradually nurture a world inside his body once the Soul Sea opened up at the Soul Sea Realm. From there, all kinds of creatures would be nurtured, forming a new country, a new society, and a completely new culture.</p>

  <p>However, there was a law which governed such a world. Any creature that was raised in it was not allowed to leave its premises. If they left, the laws of that world would prevent them by disintegrating them into life vitality again.</p>

  <p>This specific rule was also the strongest Law of Causality in the universe. So far, no one had been able to break this rule.</p>

  <p>There was an abundant supply of legends and stories that were passed down in the supreme worlds. Among them was a tale about a Supreme Lord who fell in love with a woman nurtured in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord had thought of many ways to bring the woman out of his inner world. And so, he had spent thousands of years traveling throughout the universe to find a solution. In the end, he found one.</p>

  <p>That Supreme Lord had paid a great price to have this woman survive in the outside world for only one day!</p>

  <p>The next day, the woman had quickly dissolved into life vitality and dissipated into air under the Law of Causality, never to return again.</p>

  <p>This tragic story was well known in the Upper World, especially among humans. Even a Supreme Lord couldn't defy such a law, let alone ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>But according to Luo Zheng's master's deduction, lives and materials in the inner world which was cultivated from chaotic energy were no different from the ones in this universe.</p>

  <p>Simply put, if Luo Luo Zheng had successfully opened up his Soul Sea and nurtured many living creatures and other materials in it, he would be able to bring them out to the outside world.</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. All living beings in the universe evolved from chaos, which meant that the creatures Luo Luo Zheng had created from the chaotic sea and the living beings in the universe were the same. They weren't affected by the Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>Then again, it was just his master's deduction about the Primal Chaos Technique. After all, no one had practiced the Primal Chaos Technique before Luo Luo Zheng. Even though his master's existence was above the heavens, it was hard to avoid a big mistake in deducing something.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had passed his tenth Heavenly Tribulation, he used his inner vision to observe his inner world. After a while of observation, he discovered that the chaotic energy had become increasingly viscous; but there were no traces of liquefaction.</p>

  <p>Back then when Luo Luo Zheng had just stepped into the Life and Death Realm, his life vitality had started to liquefy already. He didn't expect that now that he had stepped into the Soul Sea Realm, the same had yet to happen to the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Such was hard for Luo Luo Zheng to figure out. No one could solve the problems he faced. Even his master, the creator of the Primal Chaos Technique, couldn't give him an answer. He could only wait patiently.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had experienced all his tribulations, the Passing the Torch finally came to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>The old man in cotton clothes waved his hand and removed the seal that covered the venue.</p>

  <p>But the moment he removed the seal, everyone suddenly realized that there was something wrong with their surroundings.</p>

  <p>A crease formed between Layla's brows as she looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"There are so many clouds," she said.</p>

  <p>The sky above everyone's heads was now covered with fluffy white clouds.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"How could there be such clouds in the Orange Sea World when there's no rain all year round?"</p>

  <p>"Something doesn't seem right about these clouds."</p>

  <p>It wasn't long after that someone had noticed something strange. There were faint shadows within the clouds, which constantly evolved.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord stared at the clouds as well. Then his gaze suddenly focused on something. In a single step, he disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders seemed to have thought of something too, and they instantly disappeared one after another as well.</p>

  <p>A moment later, the Sunset World lord stood in front of the giant stone on Willow Island.</p>

  <p>The two ragged Spirit Supreme Realm warriors stood in front of the huge rock and blankly stared at the clouds in the sky. Their eyes shone with indescribable joy. It turned out that they were actually trying to feel something from the clouds.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the clouds shrouded the entire Willow Island.</p>

  <p>While the clouds endlessly drifted about, faint figures appeared from within their fluffy white bodies. All of them moved in the same way, which was a simple and direct stabbing motion.</p>

  <p>However, that single stab contained unfathomable, boundless power in it.</p>

  <p>"It's the Gods-intimidating Strike! It is a sword attack that Supreme Lord Sword had spent his entire life creating. Although it's only a single strike, it is the only strike that can harm a True God."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that I'm not a sword cultivator."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I can't miss such a rare opportunity. Even though I can't comprehend the sword intent inside it, I can assimilate it into my own spear," the Sunset World lord muttered.</p>

  <p>He sat in a cross-legged position like the two Spirit Supreme Realm martial artists, floated up into the air to look at the thick clouds, and tried to comprehend the strike.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord would never pass up on such a rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the others followed suit.</p>

  <p>One by one, the palace leaders, even Yolande and the old man in cotton clothes began to focus on the clouds.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng and the others couldn't move as fast as the palace leaders and world lord who could teleport, they weren't slow either. They quickly rushed as well and when they saw the sky upon arrival, they immediately understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>Someone must have triggered the secret left behind by Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>At this point, no one really cared about who exactly had done it and how they triggered it. No one wanted to miss out on such a great chance.</p>

  <p>They all raised their heads and tried to understand the sword intent as much as they could.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes moved to look at the figures in the clouds. His jaw dropped, and his gaze became slightly dazed.</p>

  <p>This strike was quite similar to Luo Zheng's No Move. In fact, they were even indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>But of course, they were still greatly different in nature.</p>

  <p>They were both only one strike, and both were created under the principle that the greatest truths were the simplest. However, Supreme Lord Sword's move was a lot fiercer than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's No Move couldn't be broken because it had no fixed form.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Supreme Lord Sword's strike couldn't be broken either, but it was because it had an extremely fixed form.</p>

  <p>So even with the same principle, the two strikes were vastly different due to the completely different methods.</p>

  <p>However, it had to be said that Supreme Lord Sword was superior. This Supreme Lord with the title of "Sword" was one of the martial arts ancestors when it came to comprehending sword moves.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Luo Zheng had an advantage. Since he understood the No Move, it was easier for him to grasp the depth and intensity of the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>
