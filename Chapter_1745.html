<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was annoyed when he saw the mass of densely packed small spiders that spread like a bloody ocean towards him.</p>

  <p>He had faced a myriad of difficulties in the past, but he had never been so passive. Being caught off his guard while he fell into this particular world lord's trap irritated Luo Zheng to no end.</p>

  <p>The only thing that comforted him was Xun.</p>

  <p>Although Xun did not tell Luo Zheng what was in her mind, he could tell from her attitude that Finch's trick did not impress her.</p>

  <p id="top_17">Finch also seemed to be wary of these small spiders. As he saw them spread out, he tapped his finger gently and dark red flames encircled him, enveloping his entire body.</p>

  <p>The wave of spiders ebbed like the tide as they climbed up the folds of Zheng's clothing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the fist-sized crimson spiders with distrust. There was a low probability that the spiders were harmful to him, and Luo Zheng himself was not afraid of being poisoned. Why did they gather beside him?</p>

  <p>While he was still lost in his thoughts, the small spiders climbed onto his body and sunk their sharp mouthparts into his skin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not expect that the spiders' mouthparts were actually strong and powerful. His divine weapon body was not able to fight the attack, and the mouthparts embedded themselves deeply into his skin.</p>

  <p>The small spiders' bloated bodies deflated instantly, and then detached themselves from Luo Zheng before tumbling down to the ground. Surprisingly, they were actually dead.</p>

  <p>All of the spiders did the same thing. They attached themselves onto Zheng's body, and seemed to inject a substance into him from their own abdomen, before they detached themselves and fell down dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng observed his body for any changes, but he did not feel anything unusual. It baffled him. If these small spiders had injected him with poisonous venom, they wouldn't have died immediately. Why did that happen?</p>

  <p>The process had lasted for about six hours.</p>

  <p>The number of small spiders crawling up Luo Zheng like a tide earlier had decreased. The spider corpses, on the other hand, had already piled up like mountains below him.</p>

  <p>As Finch saw that it was almost time, he sneered and flew upward. He grabbed Luo Zheng and dragged him off the golden spider web.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng couldn't do anything but let Finch do what he wanted. He was also wrapped into a cocoon by so many golden spider silks; but even if he was free, he knew he still couldn't match up to Finch.</p>

  <p>Finch crossed to the other side carrying Luo Zheng in his arms. After walking a short distance, he smiled faintly and gestured with his hand, making the hexagonal seal float down with Xun and trail behind them.</p>

  <p>"You just need to endure it for little while, and your suffering will end soon," Finch sneered.</p>

  <p>He pulled Luo Zheng over to a corner of the space and a bronze door appeared in front of him out of thin air. This door was a lot smaller than the one outside the Killing Sword Mountain, but it was almost an exact replica!</p>

  <p>"I can easily deal with the door to the Killing Sword Mountain, but I can't open this door. I have already stayed here for too long. It's a good thing that you finally arrived. Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Finch finished speaking, he dragged Luo Zheng and forcefully threw him towards the bronze door.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found himself airborne; he was hurtled like a stone and thrown against the bronze door. His head slammed hard onto it and produced a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The bronze door was unbelievably tough and strong. Zheng's head was considered to be a divine weapon, and yet the door wasn't even scratched after the collision.</p>

  <p>Finch wasn't contented yet. He took hold of Luo Zheng again and threw him back forcefully against the bronze door for the second time.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>After the second attempt, the bronze door remained tightly shut, without a hint of any reaction from it.</p>

  <p>Finch frowned. "Did that thing fall asleep?"</p>

  <p>As the thought crossed his mind, he grabbed Luo Zheng again and threw him hard towards the door for the third time.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>This time, the force that the blow generated was strong enough. Just the force from being thrown once by a world lord could even make Luo Zheng feel dizzy!</p>

  <p>The bronze door showed a response toward the stimulus. The sculpture of the thousand-leg spider began to move and descended quickly down the bronze door!</p>

  <p>"Is this spider alive?" Luo Zheng was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The bronze door outside the Killing Sword Mountain had a giant statue of a thousand-leg spider. Likewise, the bronze door in front of him also had a spider statue but Luo Zheng did not notice it immediately.</p>

  <p>As he looked closely, Luo Zheng realized that the thousand-leg spider wasn't a statue after all, but a giant spider that was very much alive. Maybe this spider had been crawling on the door for many years already...</p>

  <p>If this spider had been able to prevent the entry of a world lord like Finch, Luo Zheng could easily imagine the strength that this spider held.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng's thoughts were quite simple. He used to believe that after having broken through the Soul Sea Real, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm, one could become a world lord. And a Supreme Lord was superior to a world lord.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that there were still many things in this universe that he needed to understand. Even the cyan dragon and Xun did not tell him everything they knew.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng doubted himself for a moment.</p>

  <p>Could there be another reason why he motivated himself so strongly to search for his sister?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled bitterly at himself, unsure whether he had a chance to unravel all these mysteries in the future.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The spider crawled slowly down from the bronze door and stretched out its thin legs one by one. The tips of those legs were as sharp as the edge of a blade. With a single flick of the spider's legs, the golden threads binding Luo Zheng were immediately broken.</p>

  <p>The moment he was released from his restraints, Luo Zheng had the impulse to leap into the air and escape!</p>

  <p>However, when he tried to do so, a frustrated expression was etched into his face. He realized he was actually unable to move.</p>

  <p>The giant spider used dozens of its legs to lift Luo Zheng up and carry him through the bronze door.</p>

  <p>Finch smiled faintly as he followed closely behind, the black leopard that he had summoned also following a few steps behind him. Xun had no other choice but to accompany them through the bronze door too.</p>

  <p>The spider used innumerable legs to crawl on the ground while Luo Zheng was suspended in mid-air, under the spider's bloated belly. He noted the surroundings which they were passing through.</p>

  <p>In the cave beyond the bronze door, Luo Zheng finally saw the swords...</p>

  <p>The cavern was filled with a multitude of long swords, all of different types. There were fairy weapons, sacred weapons, and even divine weapons...</p>

  <p>"Are these swords the ones that were stabbed into the mountain? Or could all of them be just an illusion?" Luo Zheng looked around his surroundings curiously. Not long after, he was extremely shocked by what he saw.</p>

  <p>He saw Supreme Lord Sword, also known as Sword Chen!</p>

  <p>"How could this be possible..."</p>

  <p>He could not believe what he saw with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not feel any Mu Ning of vitality coming from the person in front of him. His body was totally emaciated, and he might have passed away in this place after being trapped into the Five Aging Processes. Even though a Supreme Lord had already passed away, they still radiated an Mu Ning that was difficult to approach.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already seen for himself that Sword Chen had become a True God, so when he saw his mortal husk, he was confused for a moment.</p>

  <p>Finch also seemed to be very confused by what they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Whispering Sword must have been entrusted to him by the old manor head.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Zheng told them that the old manor leader had transformed into a True God, Finch readily believed him. Now that he was suddenly faced with the old manor leader's corpse sitting in this place, he panicked immediately.</p>

  <p>Finch tried everything he could think of in order to open the bronze door, but he never managed to break through it.</p>

  <p>Never had it occurred to him that Supreme Lord Sword would have met his demise behind this door!</p>

  <p>Only the warrior who possessed the Whispering Sword could have gained the thousand-leg spider's consent and had been able to open the bronze door...</p>

  <p>Only Supreme Lord Sword could have entrusted the Whispering Sword to the warrior. However, it seemed that Supreme Lord Sword had died behind this very door.</p>

  <p>This formed a baffling paradox. If so, who had bestowed the Whispering Sword to Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Finch and Luo Zheng were both extremely perplexed, but at the same time, they could not help but also be extremely vigilant!</p>

  <p>Xun sat a bit straighter within the hexagonal seal. She watched the scene unfold from a short distance away, and a faint smile slowly appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>The way she saw it, Finch's behavior was very ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Winning the first place of the competition in the Illusion Battlefield wasn't just for bragging rights. It also determined the future of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Killing Luo Zheng wasn't really an easy task.</p>

  <p>He would possibly die in an imminent catastrophe, but it was impossible to kill him there.</p>

  <p>Xun wasn't too surprised that they were facing this kind of accident.</p>
