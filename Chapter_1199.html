  <p>
</p>

  <p>Right now, they were stuck in a dilemma. They could neither retreat nor advance.</p>

  <p>The faces of the four emperors were so grave that it seemed as if they had turned to stone.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that?" Zheng asked, his eyes narrowed to slits.</p>

  <p>Turner shook his head. "I've never seen anything like this before."</p>

  <p>War King Wind frowned. "That humanoid statue is clever. He knows that we are occupying the corpses, so he aimed his arrow at their heads to kill them!"</p>

  <p>The warriors were all in possession of a corpse each, and right now, they were rather like zombies— zombies with souls.</p>

  <p>If a corpse was shot through, it would only create a hole. It would not cause any fatal damage to the warrior, nor would blood flow out of the body.</p>

  <p>But if the arrow pierced through the head, the soul itself could shatter to pieces.</p>

  <p>The arrow could penetrate a shield of magnetic stone. Even the powerful warrior corpses that the four rulers possessed could not resist the force of the arrow.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, what should we do? Let's go back!"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty! Think of a way out of this."</p>

  <p>Some Soul Sea Realm warriors were obviously in a state of panic. On the other hand, Callan and the others, although frightened, didn't say a word.</p>

  <p>Fiona and the other martial artists of the younger generation knew they didn't have the power to work this out. They could only listen to their fathers and hope that they could figure out a way.</p>

  <p>But what could the four rulers do?</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, Turner, and Scott all had impatient looks on their faces. They had gone through great pains to obtain the bodies of the thirteenth floor and had originally planned to fight in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. However, they hadn't even entered the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land yet when they had encountered this problem. How frustrating it was!</p>

  <p>At this point, War King Wind's voice rang out. "Let's charge! It's our only option. The statue probably can't move. Everyone, let's charge together, with the giant shields!"</p>

  <p>As the king, even if he could not come up with a solution, he had the authority to make a decision on the spot. War King Wind did not know if his guess was correct. It was very possible that more people would die because of his orders, but no matter what decision he made, it was better than standing rooted to the ground and being shot.</p>

  <p>When the Soul Sea Realm masters heard his words, they no longer hesitated. Carrying their shields around them, they began trudging toward the Road of Saints.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by the shields, they tried to run faster, but it didn't make as much of a difference, even though they were indeed quicker than before.</p>

  <p>However, just then, one of the Soul Sea Realm masters pointed to the sea. "Look at him!"</p>

  <p>They turned their heads and saw the human-shaped statue take a leap and move on the sea surface.</p>

  <p>"He is actually following us! He can even move in the sea..." a powerful warrior said helplessly.</p>

  <p>"He is drawing his bow! He is drawing his bow! Everyone, be careful!"</p>

  <p>Under everyone's gazes, the humanoid statue took out another black arrow from behind his back and loaded it onto the dark golden longbow before aiming at the warriors once again.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, they had been running with all their might like a team. Now that the humanoid statue was aiming at them again, they began scrambling in all directions, flustered. They pushed and nudged each other in the process. It was havoc.</p>

  <p>"Calm down! You fools! Don't be so frantic!" War King Wind shouted out.</p>

  <p>The ruler's rage proved to be useful for they all calmed down a little.</p>

  <p>"Everyone spread out," War King Wind continued. "Try to spread out as much as possible. Don't gather in a crowd. It might cause even more deaths!"</p>

  <p>If everyone could spread out a bit, the humanoid statue's arrow would not be able to pierce through so many people at a time. If they stuck together in one place, one arrow might be able to kill five or six people, perhaps even more.</p>

  <p>They followed the orders given by War King Wind and started to spread out when another ray of black light shot out from the dark golden bow of the humanoid statue.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Its speed was only slightly faster than the arrows smeared with Dragon Arsenic. However, it could explode three times in a row in the air, in which case its speed and strength increased two-fold each time. After the third explosion, the speed and strength of the arrow reached a petrifying level.</p>

  <p>The black light disappeared quickly in front of everyone's eyes. Soon after, two small holes appeared on the giant shields.</p>

  <p>The warriors exchanged looks before their eyes landed on a Soul Sea Realm warrior on whose forehead could be seen a small hole. With a thump, he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Only one died this time," Turner mumbled.</p>

  <p>"We are still quite far away from the end of the Road of Saints. Even if we were to rush there, we would all most likely die."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the result would be the same if we were to retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?"</p>

  <p>Only one person had died because of the second arrow, but many of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm fell into despair.</p>

  <p>It was not that they were afraid of death. They had endured hardship for many years and were finally about to embark on the ascending path.</p>

  <p>Still, they hadn't expected to come face to face with such an obstacle. It was understandable for them to panic.</p>

  <p>"Send someone to take care of the statue!" War King Wind ordered in a solemn voice.</p>

  <p>"But the Road of saints is surrounded by the sea. We cannot use life vitality, nor can we fly!" a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm replied.</p>

  <p>As soon as these words fell from his lips, everyone's eyes landed on Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were aware that Zheng was the only one in possession of a physical body. He had also used his life vitality to fly before, not to mention that his physical body had the strength of the Spirit Supreme Realm. Right now, they could only count on him to get them through.</p>

  <p>However, outside of the giant shields, he had to face countless arrows, which made it equally dangerous for him to go out.</p>

  <p>When Zheng noticed everyone looking at him, he blinked, his golden eyes twinkling. He smiled faintly. "It seems like I'll have to go and destroy that statue."</p>

  <p>War King Wind's eyes bored into Zheng's. "Tianxing, if you can save us this time, you will be a great benefactor to our four divine kingdoms. If in the future..."</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand casually to stop War King Wind from continuing.</p>

  <p>"We are traveling through the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land together," he said indifferently. "We're on the same boat. If I save you guys, I would be saved too. Without further ado, open up these giant shields, please."</p>

  <p>The masters at the Soul Sea Realm gazed at Zheng with gratitude.</p>

  <p>The young man had fought on behalf of Jade Martial House beside the West Dragon River. He had demonstrated his formidable strength.</p>

  <p>Clearly, he was much stronger than his peers. After entering the Feather Holy Sea, he had played a humongous part. Now, he was the only hope the warriors had left, if they wished to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>At the moment, besides gratitude, only regret remained in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Two Soul Sea Realm masters unbuckled the giant shields. Brianna was so petite a small crack was enough for her to get out.</p>

  <p>Zheng forgot he was in her body. Her chest scraped on the edge of a shield on Zheng's way out. Brianna complained.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng chose to ignore such complaints.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>After releasing Zheng, the two mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm instantly buckled up the shields again. The black light was certainly fatal, but the arrows were fatal too.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng left the protection of the shields, seven to eight blue arrows shot toward him. Within moments, they were a few dozen feet away from him.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's life vitality had already been activated. The speed of a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior was striking. In the blink of an eye, Zheng left his original spot and soared high into the sky.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because he didn't reign in his life vitality and strength well enough. With a leap, he rushed to a height of about five thousand feet.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. If an arrow hits you, it would be a pain to deal with the Dragon Arsenic!" Brianna warned Zheng in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Zheng chuckled and nodded. His gaze swept across the golden ocean and locked on the Dragon Lineage Archer. As if sensing the stare, the archer raised his head, his pair of scarlet eyes finding Zheng as well.</p>
