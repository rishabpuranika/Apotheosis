<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the battle against the Jin Wu, the Taiyi Heaven Palace had immediately made plans and strategies in case other powerful races invaded them again.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden, and the other elders also knew that things destined to happen would happen sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Now, the core of all their plans was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The plan was to use the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's energy soul inside Luo Zheng's body, to control the physical body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. That way, the resulting power would be much stronger than that of their Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.</p>

  <p>Of course, the current Taiyi Heaven Palace didn't rely on Eastern Emperor Taiyi alone.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess wanted to invite the powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace to move to the Li Shan mountain temporarily when they visited the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Yet, Luo Zheng summoned Ziya, who had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras, to descend to the Source World.</p>

  <p>In turn, Ziya promised to guard the Taiyi Heaven Palace in time of danger.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Taiyi Heaven Palace felt assured.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Pearce and Auden, the Taiyi Heaven Palace was probably much stronger now that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ziya guarded the place, than when Ying and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were in charge.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, the presence of Ziya and the control of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body both needed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was still trapped in the Dragon Threads. No one knew if he could leave the Other Shore inside the Other Shore alive, more so if he could release the energy soul or summon Ziya to descend.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden, and the other powerful warriors from the Taiyi Heaven Palace all shared dark looks.</p>

  <p>"Is it only the Blood Spirit Tortoise that invaded the Bloom Divine Province?" Auden asked. "Why do you ask that?" Pearce countered.</p>

  <p>"If the powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race are here, then why did they have to use the Blood Spirit Tortoise to threaten us?" Auden asked again. The Blood Spirit Tortoise was considered one of the top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos and it was indeed very powerful.</p>

  <p>Compared to Emperor Di Jun, however, both of them had the same level of strength.</p>

  <p>If the Blood Spirit Tortoise didn't have anything to hold it back and had already taken the other powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm to the Bloom Divine Province, they would've landed at the Taiyi Mountain by now.</p>

  <p>However, the Blood Spirit Tortoise had hidden in some place that no one knew where.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it projected its shadow for everyone to see. It must be fearing something.</p>

  <p>"It is still afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi," said Pearce with a gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise was not willing to work for Xuanyuan in the first place. It came only because it had no choice but to follow the orders.</p>

  <p>It turned out that Pearce was right: the Blood Spirit Tortoise was indeed afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>To his credit, Eastern Emperor Taiyi did kill Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the reason it released the shadow was not only to intimidate everyone but also to test the waters.</p>

  <p>"Since it is afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, let's frighten it," Auden suggested.</p>

  <p>With that, he took a deep breath, and his originally wrinkled body became as plump as a ball.</p>

  <p>The ball-shaped Auden floated high in the sky and roared, "If you have the guts, then bring it on! Why use the shadow to threaten us and make a fool of yourself?"</p>

  <p>After he spat out those words, his inflated body quickly shrank back and became thin once again.</p>

  <p>It took a long time before the Blood Spirit Tortoise finally heard his voice.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing such confident words, the Blood Spirit Tortoise didn't dare to risk its life. It thought for a moment then sneered, "As far as I know, that human boy's energy souls are things that descend from the Other Shores after he carried them. If he dies, the Other Shore Tokens he has will be gone as well!"</p>

  <p>It referred to the fact that after Luo Zheng had carried the Civilization Artifacts, their fates became tied to each other.</p>

  <p>Although the energy souls could leave Luo Zheng's physical body, once he died, the Civilization Artifacts would still be destroyed. The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others would be gone as well.</p>

  <p>It seemed that his death would solve everything once for all!</p>

  <p>At that moment, both Pearce and Auden fell silent.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, such as Qiu Yinhe, Li Bianxue, Winchell, and the others, also realized the problem. Since the Blood Spirit Tortoise had set up the Dragon Threads, then Luo Zheng's opponent would also be the Blood Spirit Tortoise.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll do what you want!"</p>

  <p>Just as the strong warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were still worried, the Blood Spirit Tortoise roared and the surroundings suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Smoke clouds filled the air, and a blurry figure moved quickly amidst them.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Luo Zheng, who got sucked into the Other Shore inside the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know that his body was hung up in the air of the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had warned him, so he understood that what he was about to face was not an ordinary Other Shore creature, nor a powerful warrior at the Holy Soul Realm. It was most likely a warrior at the Eternal Realm or even one from the Element Spirit race!</p>

  <p>Though he had achieved the Holy Soul and the Myriad Tribulations Body, he hadn't entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. Naturally, he felt greatly pressured to fight a warrior at the Eternal Realm. There was almost no chance of winning in a one-on-one battle.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, it has been a long time since the Celestial Spear was repaired. How many times can my strength be magnified?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Right now, he could mostly depend on the Chaotic Source Spirits after they went through the division. His body could release up to one hundred thousand Jun of force with the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Combined with the Celestial Spear, he could further increase his strength.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven glanced at the spear and found that the light inside the originally dim tip of the spear had recovered a bit. "About three or four times," he estimated.</p>

  <p>"Three or four times..." Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>At that point, the clouds in front of him slowly dissipated, and he felt a strong deathly aura.</p>

  <p>Then, a huge red turtle's shadow gradually revealed itself from the clouds.</p>

  <p>"A giant red turtle, is this the Blood Spirit Tortoise?" Luo Zheng muttered and raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was not a warrior of this round of chaos, so he naturally didn't know the giant turtle.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had entered the Source World, he gained a good understanding of these well-known fierce beasts. This great blood-red tortoise could only be the Blood Spirit Tortoise!</p>

  <p>"Hiss! Hiss?"</p>

  <p>Two Dragon Threads on the back of the Blood Spirit Tortoise rolled like mad.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Threads, which no one knew where they began and where they ended, turned out to be the two streams of force that pulled Luo Zheng forward.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise stared at Luo Zheng, who was rapidly approaching and let out a strange laugh. "Are you the little guy who gave the Element Spirit race a headache? Let's see if you're worth fighting!"</p>

  <p>As soon as it finished speaking, streaks of blood light flashed on its back.</p>

  <p>The blood-red light spread from its shell and quickly gathered in its head.</p>

  <p>Then, its whole head turned crimson, and the mass of energy accumulated on its mouth.</p>

  <p>When it opened its mouth and spat out, copious streaks of blood-colored lightning flew towards Luo Zheng's body and painted him red!</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack?"</p>

  <p>As the torrent of blood-red lightning washed down on him, he looked like a small leaf in a hurricane as his body tumbled up and down.</p>

  <p>The mighty warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace watched the scene with horrified eyes. Every time the blood-red lightning exploded, their hearts pounded in their chests.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body. He can surely withstand it..." Li Bianxue mumbled nervously and clenched her fists.</p>

  <p>Each streak of the blood-red lightning contained power as much as eighty thousand Jun.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise thought that Luo Zheng was weak and couldn't withstand even three strikes, although he had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>It didn't expect that even though eighty thousand Jun of force was powerful, it wasn't enough to break Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>
