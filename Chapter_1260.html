<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1260 The Soul Enchanting Building </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Purple Jade Building was extremely famous in the universe, but Mu Ning didn't know about it and also could not totally understand what the beautiful woman said.</p>

  <p>Although she had to join the Purple Jade Building if she wanted to become the beautiful woman's disciple, Mu Ning didn't mind it at all.</p>

  <p>With a smile on her face, she said to the beautiful woman, "Okay! No problem!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the beautiful woman raised her head to take a look.</p>

  <p>Those large words that were formed by the giant swords seemed to form a poem which showed how much Mu Ning missed a man.</p>

  <p>Thus, the beautiful woman frowned and said, "The cultivation method of the Purple Jade Building emphasizes pure heart and few desires. If you still have any ties with the mortal world, you must get rid of them one by one. Don't even think about anything else while cultivating here."</p>

  <p>"What..." Mu Ning blinked. It was different from what the old man had told her, but she still shook her head resolutely. "That's impossible. If so, I will not join the Purple Jade Building or acknowledge you as my master!"</p>

  <p>The beautiful woman also did not expect that Mu Ning would change so quickly.</p>

  <p>But Mu Ning had the first-rank Purple Power Body, so the beautiful woman would not give up persuading Mu Ning to be her disciple.</p>

  <p>She coldly laughed. "You are still young and immature, so I won't allow you to do any reckless thing as you wish."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning didn't care how powerful the beautiful woman was, and she insisted on saying, "I will not join the Purple Jade Building! Don't force me to do that!"</p>

  <p>When the woman called Bridget saw that her master pulled a long face, she quickly persuaded, "Mu Ning, my master's suggestion is also for your own good. I think you had better..."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning got even more morose. She just wanted to be the beautiful woman's disciple, but she didn't know that there was such an annoying rule. At this moment, she did not say anything and was going to leave.</p>

  <p>But just as she was about to turn around, she felt as if her body was stuck in quicksand; she couldn't move even a single step.</p>

  <p>"Caw!" However, the Ancestral Dragon was not affected in the slightest.</p>

  <p>It leapt onto Margaret's shoulder and roared at the beautiful woman!</p>

  <p>"This little dragon... isn't affected at all!" the beautiful woman exclaimed. The beautiful woman revealed a trace of surprise on her face.</p>

  <p>In truth, this Ancestral Dragon was able to break free from the shackles of most of Original Laws. Even the high-grade Space Law and Time Law had no effect on it.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" Mu Ning wanted to leave here and return to the great world she had lived in. When she was unable to move, she suddenly waved her hand and all the giant swords in the sky smashed down.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the beautiful woman smiled faintly and waved her hand, which caused the gigantic swords to break free from Margaret's control and return to their original positions. "You're only at the Internal Elixir Realm, yet you can control millions of giant swords. This talent is indeed worthy of praise, but to think that you can injure me with them is too much. Don't be so silly! Since you're so young, and a bit stubborn, I won't blame you for this. You should just obediently follow me to the Purple Jade Building! I will treat you well. Once you make great achievement in your cultivation, I will definitely help you choose the most outstanding talent in the universe..."</p>

  <p>"You are not my master yet, so you don't have the right to pick any talent for me," Mu Ning coldly shot back. However, the beautiful woman didn't get furious. Her lips were still even curved into a smile.</p>

  <p>Bridget, who stood at one side, was also stunned. She knew that her master had a bad temper— but even if Mu Ning scolded her just now, she didn't get mad. Thus, she guessed that her master really thought much of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Mu Ning still didn't appreciate that and kept on refusing the beautiful woman's invitation. In the end, she would just ask for trouble. Bridget mentally sighed at the thought of this.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to go to the Purple Jade Building, I'll go kill that man and stop you from thinking of him. Do you think that is a good way?" the beautiful woman said in return after walking in front of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"What..."</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning heard her words, she quickly became anxious.</p>

  <p>She didn't know the beautiful woman's cultivation level and strength, but she guessed that she surely must be as powerful as that old man. Even Luo Zheng didn't have the strength to fight against him. Mu Ning was worried and didn't know what to do if the beautiful woman really intended to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the beautiful woman saw Margaret's panic-stricken face, she smiled gently. "Don't worry. If you join the Purple Jade Building and focus on your cultivation, you will soon forget about that man. After all, falling in love with someone is just of no use to a warrior..."</p>

  <p>However, Margaret's panicked expression only lasted for a moment before she coldly retorted, "Don't even think about it. If you dare kill Luo Zheng, I'll immediately commit suicide. I won't acknowledge you as my master even if I die!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?" The beautiful woman pondered over this name, and compared it to the names of hundreds of young, outstanding warriors in the universe who left the deepest impressions on her. She thought that Luo Zheng wasn't one of those outstanding warriors. Since he was a nobody, then there was nothing to be afraid of. The beautiful woman had her doubts before; if the man that Mu Ning admired was the successor of a Supreme Lord, then it would be troublesome if she killed him.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning realized that she had blurted out Zheng's name, she quickly covered her mouth, and regretted it.</p>

  <p>However, the beautiful woman did not expect that Luo Zheng, who was relatively unknown now, would become quite remarkable in the future.</p>

  <p>His name would be the one that she would never forget for the rest of her life!</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, a wave of laughter suddenly rang out in the sky.</p>

  <p>The voice sounded gentle and pleasant, but it was extremely enchanting.</p>

  <p>People's faces flushed and their hearts raced upon hearing the tantalizing laughter.</p>

  <p>While the beautiful woman still remained calm, Bridget began feeling uncomfortable. As for Mu Ning, she was affected since her cultivation base was at the lowest level. Her face flushed and her breathing quickened when the enchanting voice entered her ears. She was Zheng's woman and she wasn't a virgin anymore, so such an enchanting voice caused her body to respond unnaturally to it.</p>

  <p>"The Purple Jade Building is a building full of nuns, and those who enter there are widows. You would be very bored if you become a disciple of this woman," the voice floated over gently. It felt like someone blew cool air in Margaret's ear, which made all the hairs on her body to stand on their ends, and caused her to tremble uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a large golden bed appeared in the sky. The bed was around one hundred feet wide and over one hundred feet long, but surprisingly, a delicate woman lay on it and was not a giant.</p>

  <p>The pretty woman was pure as a white lotus. However, her minimal clothes barely covered her svelte and curvaceous figure. Ordinary men would surely find her attractive, and even Mu Ning thought that the woman was extremely charming.</p>

  <p>But what flabbergasted Mu Ning the most was that ten men, who were naked from the torso up, sat on the edge of the bed. All of them looked vigorous and powerful. Right now, all of them sat cross-legged with their eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"Leah, you impudent and immoral woman! You don't have the right to scold me!" The beautiful woman was livid when she saw the pretty woman on the bed appear.</p>

  <p>The barely clothed woman named Leah Zhao lifted her body up and coiled her legs like two thin snakes. She then placed an arm on the shoulder of one of the strong men. A charming smile lit up her face as she looked up at the poem in the sky. "Little girl, I see that you are not a virgin anymore. And you made such a gloomy poem in the sky with the giant swords because you miss a man very much, right? You should consider joining the Soul Enchanting Building. Not only can you play with all kinds of men, but you can learn about the secret female-male dual cultivation methods..."</p>

  <p>"Bitch!" the beautiful woman hissed before Leah Zhao finished speaking.</p>

  <p>Leah Zhao didn't get angry even after being insulted. She simply smiled and said, "There is more than one way to cultivate martial arts. Krista, we've already argued many times, but you haven't convinced me even once."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stood in her spot and hugged the Ancestral Dragon. Her mind was a mess and she felt very confused, as she had no idea who were these people she encountered.</p>

  <p>She didn't know that there were three buildings in the Purple Power World, and that they were well known throughout the universe. The beautiful woman, Krista Hua, was the leader of the Purple Jade Building, while Leah Zhao was the leader of the Soul Enchanting Building.</p>

  <p>However, these two buildings differed greatly from each other. The Purple Jade Building was a typical nunnery, so those who wished to enter it must have little to no desire and stop thinking about anyone or anything in their lives.</p>

  <p>As the name suggested, the Soul Enchanting Building was indeed a tempting place for many male warriors. Plenty of bold and promiscuous girls lived there, but not many warriors dared to enter such a place.</p>
