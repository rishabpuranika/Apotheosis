<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2655 The Final Resistance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily bent down and ripped a piece of cloth from a corpse. She bound it around her shoulder wound.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, she had been hit by an arrow and a serrated wound was left bleeding on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>In the past, she would have been capable of recovering from this kind of injury in the blink of an eye. In fact, there wasn't any need to deal with such a basic gash.</p>

  <p>Now, on the other hand, such a wound could easily lead to her death!</p>

  <p>After dressing her wound, Emily jumped down from the roof top.</p>

  <p>The other exiles as well as the surviving Wild Gods also moved in order to gather around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zelda and Luther, who were still under protection, both followed quickly behind, too.</p>

  <p>The battle just now was too violent.</p>

  <p>At least three quarters of Wild Gods had died, while nearly half of the exiles had been executed.</p>

  <p>That said, an approximate two hundred members of the Warden race had also been killed!</p>

  <p>In the pits of their stomachs, everyone had the feeling of having survived a disaster. Their expressions quickly changed as they glanced toward Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't fought Bonnie, Arvin and Bergen of the Warden race on his own, the battle's results would have been hard to determine.</p>

  <p>After all, one couldn't forget that Bergen alone had the capacities to fight against several exiles of high power, including Ramzi and Leopold.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Luo Zheng had blocked Arvin from the very beginning. If Arvin really employed all of his strength and cooperated with the other men in black robes, it was highly possible that the situation would become worse.</p>

  <p>By that time, all members of Luo Zheng's group would have been dead.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Emily patted Luo Zheng on the shoulder heavily and said with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Although I've probably guessed quite a bit, I wouldn't have expected this little guy to hide his skill so well!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could somehow employ such a powerful token under the effect of the Strength Equalizing token, which was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Timotheus followed the others and looked as though he was lost deep in his thoughts. With a wry smile, he said, "Even I couldn't discover that, not to mention you, Emily."</p>

  <p>In fact, Timotheus had already figured it all out.</p>

  <p>The Strength Equalizing token was created by the Chaos Ancient God. The rule he had set simply couldn't be violated by a nobody like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on his behalf, had such powerful might because of his blood.</p>

  <p>His token was most likely the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline token.</p>

  <p>Thus, he could easily break another Chaos Ancient God's rule and get rid of the Strength Equalizing token's restriction.</p>

  <p>This was something that Timotheus had understood and he wasn't willing to discuss the matter.</p>

  <p>Timotheus was pleased to note that Luo Zheng had the capacities to lead them all forward. He felt very content.</p>

  <p>So much so, in fact, that he even felt no matter how bad the situation for the Nine Li race was in the Source World, as long as Luo Zheng was present, they still had a glimmer of hope. If he could leave this place, he'd try his best to follow and support Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors had been seriously injured in this last battle, and more than ten of them had lost their arms or legs.</p>

  <p>The badly injured warriors who were unable to fight had no choice but to stay where they were. At least for now.</p>

  <p>If they could at least get rid of the Strength Equalizing token, those who had lost their limbs would have the capacity to grow them back in a very short period of time.</p>

  <p>Emily and a few of the other warriors were also injured, but nothing too serious. They could take a little ordinary medicine for treatment in order to heal from their wounds. The treatment effects were naturally very ordinary, and for this reason, they chose not to move forward immediately, but to recuperate instead.</p>

  <p>"Arvin, Bonnie, and Bergen are the backbone of the conservative faction.</p>

  <p>The rest of them won't make a move on their own, and they will definitely guard the Equality Altar. There's no need to be afraid," Zelda encouraged, looking into Luo Zheng's eyes. She continued, "And best of all, we still have Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>At the very beginning of it all, Zelda had only hoped that Luo Zheng would help her get revenge by taking advantage of the exiles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng becoming a killer had never once crossed her mind.</p>

  <p>Unbelievably, these powerful exiles were pinning their hopes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we've nearly succeeded!" an exile shouted.</p>

  <p>"Do you think we can finally go back to the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"We must be sure to thank Luo Zheng this time!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the exiles lit up, and their hope had been sparked. Success was at the tip of their fingers. Inevitably, they felt a little excited.</p>

  <p>As Zelda looked at the corpses lying on the ground in all directions, a hint of sadness appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She was the one who had caused this war. She was, to say the least, the traitor of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>The disputes between the conservative faction and the free faction were something she had never wanted to see, or ever be a part of.</p>

  <p>However, as she thought of her parents who had been murdered, the sadness in her eyes gradually faded away. Perhaps she had been destined to suffer through this all.</p>

  <p>After resting for an entire day, the group continued moving forward together.</p>

  <p>In fact, the location where they fought with the Warden race was very close to the Equality Altar. Approximately an eight-mile distance was a breeze to walk.</p>

  <p>Just as Zelda had predicted, the Warden race had lost the courage to take the initiative in attacking.</p>

  <p>The lack was so present that they didn't even send warriors out to investigate the battle. There was simply no need.</p>

  <p>The Equality Altar Zelda had mentioned was the disk located in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>All around the Equality Altar, more than half of the arranged Life Lamps had gone out. When the Warden race's members noticed the extinguished Life Lamps, they looked grieved.</p>

  <p>"Bergen, Bonnie..."</p>

  <p>The leader of the Warden race murmured in a low voice, as he stood in front of the extinguished Life Lamps. He closed his eyes sadly.</p>

  <p>The extinguishing of any respective Life Lamp represented the death of a member. If so many Life Lamps were currently extinguished, it meant that most of the people they'd sent out were now dead.</p>

  <p>These warriors were the Warden race's elites. Their death could only mean that the Warden race had suffered a crushing defeat.</p>

  <p>"Master! We are still alive!" a voice shouted from behind.</p>

  <p>A man in a black robe pulled back his cloak and revealed his grey hair.</p>

  <p>He was very old.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are! And we can still fight against them! Under the Strength Equalizing token's effect, our strength won't be any weaker than Bergen's! We have nothing to lose." Another old man also took off his black robe and stepped forward, showing himself.</p>

  <p>All the race members present were either the old, weak, sick or disabled people from the conservative faction. With the Strength Equalizing token, everyone would be equal, no matter how weak they were. They would thus have the same ability as the strong, and the only thing that would come into play would be their experience and martial art skills.</p>

  <p>"You're right... I hadn't considered this option..." The leader of the Warden race nodded, struggled to open his eyes fully, clenched his jaw and said, "We can still join the fight!"</p>

  <p>With those words, he walked forward from the shadows of the Equality Altar.</p>

  <p>Not far off in the distance, the tomb keeper sat against a wall in a lazy manner.</p>

  <p>"Have you failed?" the tomb keeper asked casually.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Warden race nodded and replied, "Yes."</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper tilted his head and thought for a brief moment. "The so-called Strength Equalizing token couldn't actually equalize all warriors' strength, as you have the grace from Herbert. But they still defeated you. The exiles aren't as simple as you think."</p>

  <p>"I know. And they'll be here soon. Sir, do you think you can help me with that?" the leader of the Warden race asked, while cupping his hands pleadingly.</p>

  <p>Prior to now, he could place his hope on Bergen and the others. Currently though, the tomb keeper seemed to be his best option.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper nodded lightly. "I have agreed and thus, I will certainly make my move. But don't expect me to risk my life for you."</p>
