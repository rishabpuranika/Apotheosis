<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3011 At The Top </b></h2>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Beldene shook his head solemnly. "No matter what blessing he has received, he's still just a nonentity. We have nothing to envy of him."</p>

  <p>The disciple shrugged his shoulders and said, "In that case, we can only say that there's an extraordinary talent from the small Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he's joined the Sword Dance Palace. I still don't think he can break your record, though."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's wait and see," replied Beldene with a sly smile, glancing over at Elgin who was sanding just a few feet away.</p>

  <p>Beldene and Elgin were considered to be the most outstanding talents in the Sword Light Palace. Beldene, on his behalf, wasn't as talented as Elgin, but he was always the more optimistic one.</p>

  <p>Beldene knew how strong he was, and wasn't shy about demonstrating it.</p>

  <p>He was an enviable talent in the Sword Light Palace, but he wasn't considered as outstanding among the talented disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. In other words, it was expected that someone could eventually surpass him and break his record.</p>

  <p>However, Elgin from the Burial Sword Palace wasn't the most positive person. Now, he could be seen grim faced and fists clenched.</p>

  <p>In his eyes alone, he was now the number one warrior in the Sword Light Palace, and the palace had great expectations of him. Although Beldene was strong enough to become his opponent, he thought he was much better than him, of course.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng broke his record, he'd snatch away the honor that should belong to him. Luo Zheng might even replace him!</p>

  <p id="top_11">Because his sword-shaped pattern had been on the top, he simply couldn't compete with Luo Zheng in the Truth Competition. In fact, he couldn't do anything to stop him.</p>

  <p>"4, 200 words!" someone declared.</p>

  <p>"Apparently, he just won't stop!" someone else stated.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he's going to break the record."</p>

  <p>Many disciples spoke over one another. Luo Zheng didn't quicken or slow down his reciting speed. Instead, he remained steady, constant and confident.</p>

  <p>'I'm easily learning the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. This is so strange!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself while he continued reciting. It was safe to say that this was something that he hadn't expected.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Divine Dao reached him through the cyan thread. Instead of feeling any pressure, his thoughts were clear and he was greatly enlightened.</p>

  <p>"4, 250 words! He has officially broken Beldene's record!" exclaimed the crowd together.</p>

  <p>Beldene shrugged his shoulders in a nonchalant manner, still feeling relaxed.</p>

  <p>"4, 300 words! He has now broken Elgin's record, too!" roared the crowd again, even more excitedly this time.</p>

  <p>The gap between Beldene and Elgin was only 50 words. Luo Zheng had broken each of their records only seconds apart.</p>

  <p>As this realization came over Elgin, the corners of his eyes began to twitch.</p>

  <p>He had mixed feelings about this whole situation.</p>

  <p>On the platform, Dalton and Charlene wore a long face. Beldene and Elgin were the most outstanding disciples of their respective cultivation palaces.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had broken their records, they naturally weren't happy.</p>

  <p>"He should just stop now that he has broken Elgin's record," Dalton said, obviously frowning.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! To the contrary, I think this is just a beginning," said Ingram with a wide smile.</p>

  <p>"Just the beginning? Come on, don't exaggerate," Charlene replied, narrowing her eyes and suddenly becoming more stern.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what level he can reach in his first attempt," the officiant added with a curious smile.</p>

  <p>After reciting 4, 300 words, Luo Zheng showed no intentions of stopping.</p>

  <p>He quickly climbed to 4, 500 words.</p>

  <p>And then to 5, 000 words.</p>

  <p>5, 500 words...</p>

  <p>At that point, all disciples from every cultivation palace had stopped comprehending the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>They put down the translations they were holding in their hands, and quietly continued watching Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng was the only one still reading aloud among the thirteen platforms.</p>

  <p>Some disciples occasionally recited a few words because Luo Zheng had reached their levels. They didn't want to waste their chance of competing with Luo Zheng in the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>Combined with a few screams, some of those disciples stopped reciting completely.</p>

  <p>Of course, most of the disciples could recite 3, 000 words at most. After breaking through 5, 000 words, few of them could even challenge Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nearly every single one of them had a look of excitement on their faces.</p>

  <p>This was human nature. If you surpassed someone, even a little bit, they might become jealous. If you left them far behind, all they could do was to look up to you.</p>

  <p>Now, the outstanding disciples from both the Burial Sword Palace and the Demon Sword Palace as well as the ordinary disciples no longer had any enmity toward Luo Zheng. They all hoped he could go even further.</p>

  <p>"6, 000 words! Imagine that! He's successfully broken your record, Ingram," Laura said with a slight, teasing smile.</p>

  <p>Back then, she thought highly of Luo Zheng and her instinct told her that she had to bring him into the Sword Light Palace. By the looks of things, it seemed her judgment was correct.</p>

  <p>"Ingram underestimated Luo Zheng. According to the Sword Light Palace's grading system, I think his talent is of the seventh or even the eighth grade," the officiant said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Ingram still wore a smile on his face. He could only look at Luo Zheng quietly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still hadn't stopped.</p>

  <p>He reached 6, 500 words.</p>

  <p>7, 000 words...</p>

  <p>7, 500 words was next!</p>

  <p>He topped 8, 000 words!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern grew bigger and bigger, and it also rose higher and higher at a fantastic speed.</p>

  <p>The platforms became increasingly quiet as everyone fell into a state of amazement before Luo Zheng's performance. Aside from the gentle wind, only Luo Zheng's sonorous voice could be heard.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Faegan, Jago and Kenelm were still staring at Luo Zheng, completely dumbfounded and speechless. Luo Zheng's performance was beyond their grandest cognition. They didn't know what this could mean to the Sword Light Palace. Kenelm vaguely thought that Luo Zheng might just comprehend the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent thoroughly in a single breath.</p>

  <p>8, 500 words.</p>

  <p>9, 000 words.</p>

  <p>"Here he comes..."</p>

  <p>Beldene looked at the Lofty Sword. Since Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern was now very close to his, he was capable of competing with Luo Zheng in the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, his fellow disciple had become very excited after fighting against Luo Zheng in the Truth Competition. He had even broken through his bottleneck. If he could really make a breakthrough by fighting with Luo Zheng in the Truth Competition, there was no way Beldene would miss such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, his sword-shaped pattern was already heading straight for Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Not only Beldene, but by the looks of it, Elgin had made the same decision.</p>

  <p>However, Elgin still felt a trace of resentment in his heart. Although he understood that he couldn't necessarily suppress Luo Zheng, he still needed a way to vent his anger.</p>

  <p>When the two sword-shaped patterns, which were as tall as a man, attacked Luo Zheng, crisp clash sounds came from the Lofty Sword once again.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng had a better understanding of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the aura he released quickly became extremely ferocious.</p>

  <p>At the moment of collision, Elgin felt a white light flash in his mind, a light that would tear his soul into two pieces.</p>

  <p>It was then that Elgin finally understood why the other disciples screamed in shrill voices.</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene remained far more powerful than the others. They let out nothing more than a muffled hum, endured the sharp pain, and continued battling Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The three sword-shaped patterns met at once and gave off a series of crisp sounds as they collided repeatedly with each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was as calm as he ever had been. Elgin and Beldene, on the contrary, were drenched in sweat, their eyes wide open. Obviously, they had reached their limits.</p>

  <p>After a while, Beldene ultimately couldn't hold on any longer. He rolled his eyes upward so only the white could be seen and fell to the platform with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Elgin's eyes were red, and he held on for another three seconds. Then his tense face became listless and he fell down too.</p>
