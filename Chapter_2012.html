<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2012 The Unfamiliar Xun </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The massive form turned out to be the body of an adult Genuine Dragon!</p>

  <p>Its dark cyan scales were closely packed, forming a strong layer of armor on its body. It emitted a dreamy luster underneath the sun's rays.</p>

  <p>Two, sharp, yellow horns protruded from its head and its bewitching red eyes exuded such a powerful aura that hit like a tidal wave upon those who watched it with awe.</p>

  <p>If a Genuine Phoenix's rank and potential depended on the number of feathers on its tail, to a Genuine Dragon, these things were measured by the number of claws it had.</p>

  <p>Ordinary Genuine Dragons normally had three while stronger ones had four. The strongest Genuine Dragon had five!</p>

  <p>Only two, five-clawed Genuine Dragons existed in the entire Genuine Dragon World: the eldest of the nine dragon brothers and also the strongest existence in the Genuine Dragon World - the Five-clawed Golden Dragon. The other was the similarly Five-clawed Black Dragon.</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon that the Celestial Position race had once captured also had five claws.</p>

  <p>However, the dark cyan dragon had six!</p>

  <p>The dragon shot straight to the sky and let out a mighty roar!</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>This was no simple roar. By just hearing that loud, powerful noise, all weak creatures and lower level vicious beasts of the Rosy Cloud World began to submit and tremble in their caves.</p>

  <p>The dark cyan dragon's roar triggered something in these creatures - a sense of instinctive fear for survival in the face of such a powerful being.</p>

  <p>This kind of instinct was something in their bones that was formed through the countless years' of evolution, passed down from generation to generation!</p>

  <p>Even the Supreme Lords and the two queens felt their heartbeat quicken.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The enormous Genuine Dragon circled the air once before heading straight towards the Inauguration Altar and lowering its massive head.</p>

  <p>From the dragon's head fell down a girl. She somersaulted in the air and landed light as a feather on the big crater.</p>

  <p>Yao, Ying, and Supreme Lord Korbin stood near while Supreme Lord Shadow was currently bound to Zheng by the Death Chain. That woman ignored all of them and walked towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Xun," he called out in such a gentle voice as she approached.</p>

  <p>The woman in front of him looked so familiar yet exuded an unreal aura of strange unfamiliarity. She was as pure as a newborn baby, her entire body emitting a perfect aura.</p>

  <p>Yet, all in all, she was Xun.</p>

  <p>She had always appeared before Zheng in soul form so it was only understandable why he felt so strange facing her now. Even when she was in the form of the sword spirit, it was still as insubstantial as a shadow.</p>

  <p>So this should be what Xun was like in his mind.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but feel somewhat unfamiliar with this brand-new body of hers.</p>

  <p>Xun, on the other hand, did not have any regard for these strange feelings he had. She quickly rushed towards Zheng and pulled him into an embrace.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not struggle, nor did he say anything and instead simply buried his head deep in her chest. Her aura might be unfamiliar and strange, so far from the Xun he was used to, but deep inside he knew that it was still her. At that moment, Zheng felt as if all the burden had been lifted from his shoulders.</p>

  <p>As Xun held Zheng, she was also glaring daggers at Yao who stood not far away from them. The killing intent was evident in the queen's raging eyes. "This day has finally come... Bitch."</p>

  <p>Her entire body was tensed as she stared at Yao in motionless rage.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yao simply stared back at Xun with her teeth clenched. It was the only way she could conceal the turmoil in her heart.</p>

  <p>How could this be?!</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been that big of a problem if Zheng was so good that she wasn't able to kill him.</p>

  <p>Sealing him with the Punishment of Eternal Night was already enough and she could've just handed him over to the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Leroy had lost all will to fight. A Supreme Lord that had entered the Five Aging Processes posed no threat to her at all. It would've been so easy for her to have ended him.</p>

  <p>Everything was under her control. Even Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow helped her despite having been initially neutral.</p>

  <p>The odds were all in Yao's favor.</p>

  <p>How could there be such a huge, sudden turn of events?</p>

  <p>Why did such a large, six-clawed Genuine Dragon appear? Weren't the strongest dragons only five-clawed?</p>

  <p>Why and how in the world did Xun appear in front of her? Didn't she disappear a long time ago?</p>

  <p>Why did the Faith Energy in her Pool of Faith disappear in an instant?</p>

  <p>All these thoughts circulated in Yao's panicked mind.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, she felt as if she was in control but in the blink of an eye, it was as if she had lost everything.</p>

  <p>The extreme disappointment was enough to drive Yao mad! She was just about to go crazy but at the last moment, she decided to channel her rage into a powerful lightning strike at Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun sneered as she watched Yao, who had turned herself into a bolt of lightning that rushed towards her.</p>

  <p>"Spear," she said, taking out the Saint Killing Spear from Zheng's space ring.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment she held the spear, her entire aura changed. Rich, malicious auras spiraled into the Saint Killing Spear while long, thin bone spikes condensed on her back.</p>

  <p>The bones all formed into two, irregular bone wings condensed by Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>This was Xun's fighting state!</p>

  <p>In the Demon Night race, the Queen of Life and the Queen of Punishment didn't need to go into battle. All wars were led by the Queen of Killings who was born for battle. Thus, Xun was the only one who had this kind of special, fighting state.</p>

  <p>Xun had activated this fighting state before. By relying on the Faith Energy in the Dark World, Xun had once condensed this pair of bone wings for herself. However, at that time, Yao had quickly sealed Xun's Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>"You... You are the bitch!"</p>

  <p>Yao looked crazy and angry. Her once beautiful place now looked distorted and creepy. She rose and frantically poured life vitality into the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer.</p>

  <p>Her strike was no doubt intimidating but the only reason she was so strong was because of the Faith Energy in the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>Now that she had lost her supply, she had no choice but to rely on her life vitality. Her level right now was only that of a world lord, at most a top-level grand world lord.</p>

  <p>Xun almost laughed at how pathetic her opponent looked. She turned the Saint Killing Spear and a massive spear shadow appeared.</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!"</p>

  <p>The spear shadow was blood-red and was several times stronger than the Shadowy Spin she had used before. However, instead of shooting it straight to Yao, she angled it in such a way that it hit the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer.</p>

  <p>Crackle…</p>

  <p>Countless lightning bolts spread throughout the hammer and tried to counter the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>Xun merely shook the spear gently and made all the lightning bolts disappear.</p>

  <p>Yao's strike didn't work so she decided to change her angle. The Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer once again smashed down towards Xun.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Killings was calm in the face of such aggression. She pulled back the spear and pointed it at the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer once again.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a series of explosions as the two clashed. Yao struck out a dozen times and Xun countered even more.</p>

  <p>The difference though was that Yao had gone all out while Xun was very much relaxed in blocking the attacks directed at her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It seemed Xun had gotten bored of Yao's pestering. She suddenly raised her spear and made the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer fly out of Yao's hand. It spun in the air and created a small hole at the bottom of the huge crater.</p>

  <p>Now that she was without a weapon, the crazed look on Yao's face quickly melted.</p>

  <p>She had lost the Pool of Faith and then the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer. There was nothing else she could do to fight against Xun.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>At this time, Leroy suddenly shot down from the sky!</p>

  <p>He was initially quietly floating in the air but had fallen into despair.</p>

  <p>However, the quick progression of events completely flabbergasted him.</p>

  <p>It was as if he was in a dream. Was the image in front of him truly real?</p>

  <p>"My queen!" he exclaimed as he rushed towards Xun's side.</p>

  <p>Xun's vicious face softened when she saw him. "Leroy, you... You have grown so much."</p>

  <p>A warrior at Leroy's level aging meant only one thing: he had finally entered the Five Aging Processes. Such process was irreversible and Leroy would inevitably slide into death's abyss. There was no way that could change his fate.</p>
