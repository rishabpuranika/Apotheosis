<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3871 Backup Plan </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the Grandmaster of Heaven descended, he couldn't help but gaze at those down below.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yellow Thearch, each one of them made his blood boil.</p>

  <p>He knew that the people that stood before him had different standpoints and were mere avatars devoid of memory, but it didn't stop the inexplicable hatred that surged in his heart when his eyes swept over their faces.</p>

  <p>His negative feelings did not go unnoticed. Everyone felt the waves of anger that emanated from the Grandmaster of Heaven, including Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer who had gradually recovered from the form of a goat monster.</p>

  <p>Mahoney, however, felt a bit lucky.</p>

  <p>This mysterious man in black had such a furious expression when he looked at the others but when it came to her, all he had was an expressionless gaze.</p>

  <p>She hoped she wouldn't find trouble with her.</p>

  <p>Just as Mahoney silently rejoiced, the Grandmaster of Heaven turned towards her. "I shall kill this irrelevant person first.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The Heart-piercing Lock in his hand trembled just as a long, thin chain emerged and headed straight towards Mahoney. Instead of white jade, the chain was stark black, obviously of lower grade than the one that had trapped Othniel. But it was more than enough to trap Mahoney.</p>

  <p>After she heard the Grandmaster of Heaven's words, Mahoney's face quickly paled. She rolled backwards, just as the chain headed her way, and tried to get out of her now precarious situation.</p>

  <p>The space in front of the black chain distorted as it appeared right in front of Mahoney.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Mahoney's armor, a masterpiece that she was quite proud of, shattered underneath the piercing force of the black chain.</p>

  <p>With no defensive chestplate, the black chain sunk into her chest, and the moment it entered her body, the Spearhead Armor of Destruction on her body collapsed instantly while her life force rapidly faded away.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Mahoney's life force dissipated entirely.</p>

  <p>An Eternal Realm warrior truly was no match against the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>As the chain retracted, Mahoney's corpse snapped back and shot towards the black ship.</p>

  <p>"Deal with the corpse," the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered darkly.</p>

  <p>The sight of Mahoney's corpse made Shera salivate.</p>

  <p>Her ghouls were weak and all she could really do was transform her own body.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven basically awarded her an Eternal Realm warrior, which meant she had a lot of room to work with when it came to her transformation. In her eyes, Mahoney's body was an extremely rare treasure.</p>

  <p>Shera caught her body and gave Fuxi and the others a momentary side glance. "Thank you, Grandmaster of Heaven."</p>

  <p>The meaning behind her eyes was clear: these Eternal Realm warriors were next.</p>

  <p>If Shera cultivated these warriors into ghouls then she would be able to do anything she wanted in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch's and Divine Farmer's faces darkened when they witnessed Mahoney's end. Meanwhile, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess began to gather their power.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, these two groups of people were still fighting each other.</p>

  <p>Now there was no other choice out of this situation but to join hands and fight against this powerful enemy!</p>

  <p>This mysterious man in black was truly strange.</p>

  <p>Not only did he possess Othniel's truth-level theurgy which was impossible to guard against, he also had the Heart-piercing Lock that had the ability to entrap and lock everything within its hold.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess exchanged a knowing look with Fuxi as she summoned a Descending Ring in her hand.</p>

  <p>After she obtained the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits from Zheng, she carefully studied the use of the Descending Rings.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Fuxi was keen on reserving the Descending Rings to summon the Augury Dog.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog was powerful, and was his best friend in the Three Purities Stage. In terms of strength, he was only a little weaker than Fuxi, and much more powerful than the ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>A Descending Ring was not easy to obtain so why would they use it just so that one more Eternal Realm master could guard the Pear Hill? The Snake Goddess did not want that.</p>

  <p>So on the Three Purities Stage, she gave a Descending Ring to the Primal Crocodile race.</p>

  <p>They were also an extremely powerful force in the Three Purities Stage but were extremely xenophobic and cared little for the affairs of the world.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit race did not dare provoke them, much less enter their territory.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, the Snake Goddess saved the life of a little Primal Crocodile and earned her this elusive race's friendship.</p>

  <p>With this friendship forged, the leader of the race agreed to the Snake Goddess's request and promised to help her out whenever she needed their support to return the favor.</p>

  <p>There was no way she would summon such powerful warriors from the Other Shore if she had any other choice.</p>

  <p>This situation was so unexpected. Just a moment ago, everyone was watching the two fighting and then suddenly Othniel was captured and all Eternal Realm warriors had to worry about their fates.</p>

  <p>Beside her, Fuxi's eyes remained full of fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>Save for the Heart-piercing Lock and a few small theurgies, this man in black wasn't that intimidating. Fuxi figured that if he truly went all out then he could defeat him.</p>

  <p>Just as the two were about to make their move, Yellow Thearch's forehead split open and a burst of hearty laughter was heard.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven! Why are you in such a hurry to descend from the Other Shore?" It was Claire from the Element Spirit race!</p>

  <p>There was no surprise on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face when he heard this voice. He'd fought with the Element Spirit race for hundreds of chaotic eras so it would be more surprising if they didn't show up.</p>

  <p>A smile broke through his face. "As far as I know, you haven't found a way to descend yet."</p>

  <p>Claire scoffed. "That's because they're too stupid."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter if they are stupid or geniuses. If you don't have backup plans, just shut your mouth and admit that I've won."</p>

  <p>After he spoke, the Grandmaster of Heaven lifted his Cyan Misty Sword and stabbed towards Yellow Thearch's forehead.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch's expression changed and he revealed an incredibly charming smile. "Although we missed the Descending Rings, it doesn't mean we don't have other ways to descend!" he said in a girlish voice.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was witness to how Yellow Thearch's hair suddenly burned and the eyeball in the center of his forehead glowed with a golden light that emitted an aura similar to that of Descending Rings.</p>

  <p>They watched as his appearance, expression, and aura, all transformed into Claire's image.</p>

  <p>Before the Grandmaster of Heaven could react, Claire had already stepped forward and swung Zheng towards him, hard.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A burst of blue light flashed in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes as he used the spatial distortion to dodge the blow.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster..."</p>

  <p>"That Zheng can devour..."</p>

  <p>The people from the Black Ship all tried to warn him but it was already too late.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng touched the twisted space, he completely devoured the energy and returned the space to normal which meant he smashed onto the Grandmaster of Heaven with no hindrance whatsoever.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Hit by such a formidable weapon, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying into the air.</p>

  <p>Claire smirked in satisfaction at this temporary weapon of hers.</p>

  <p>"Fire!"</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>She wanted to ignite a flame but forgot the characteristics of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The fire barely flickered as it was immediately absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>She made a face but did not really care. She took a step forward and reached the other side of the space. Again, she wielded Zheng as a blunt weapon.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng's body smashed onto the Grandmaster of Heaven the second time, Othniel, who was bound by the Heart-piercing Lock, was also dragged down and hit the ground hard.</p>
