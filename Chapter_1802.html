<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had fused with the great world's will, he had become the son of the great world.</p>

  <p>He actually became the master of the great world.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why he could transfer the power he had received into the great world. He could even look through the memories of any time and place if he wished.</p>

  <p>However, as the strange will spread out, it gradually integrated itself into the will of the great world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't able to do anything to prevent this from happening. Because his will was fused with the great world's, the three wills were now fused together.</p>

  <p>It also surprised Luo Zheng that this strange will had spread out at an extremely rapid pace.</p>

  <p>In just half a minute, the will had already extended beyond the great world. It engulfed the wills of some other great worlds and continued to expand rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Luo Zheng was astonished.</p>

  <p>In the past, the great world was damaged and had an opening. Luo Zheng sensed that he could explore great worlds beyond it, such as the ocean of the nearest neighboring great world.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, he knew and he felt that the range of his perception was rapidly increasing at an incredible rate.</p>

  <p>He perceived everything happening within the four surrounding great worlds.</p>

  <p>For instance, the southern great world only had one giant continent. This continent had a land area that was almost 20 times larger than the Divine Kingdom Continent. The sea realm there was not too large; it was only about a third of the great world.</p>

  <p>The northern great world was the complete opposite. The entire great world was surrounded by water, with islands interspersed throughout the ocean. On these islands existed diverse kinds of creatures, but the majority were humans.</p>

  <p>After two minutes, Luo Zheng realized he could perceive sixteen great worlds.</p>

  <p>After around five minutes, he already sensed more than 400 great worlds.</p>

  <p>It was at that point that the speed at which the will was frantically spreading out gradually slowed down.</p>

  <p>'The will's limit of expansion is less than five hundred great worlds?' Luo Zheng continuously reached inside his consciousness as he came up with a rough estimate.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if he could transfer the power he received into these great worlds. If he was able to do so, it would be an enormous enhancement for his capabilities. He hoped that his will would expand further.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he discovered that the great worlds he perceived had doubled in number. He was able to sense over a thousand great worlds.</p>

  <p>'What's going on?' Luo Zheng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment and quickly understood what happened. This strange will had spread outwards from the center of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and had gradually extended across more than five hundred great worlds. In fact, there appeared to be more of this kind of extremely special will that existed in other great worlds. They continued to expand and fuse with each other.</p>

  <p>'Could it be that a million great worlds could all be interconnected? If this was really the work of the sorcerer race, then they must have been plotting truly terrible things!' Luo Zheng was completely shocked.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached that conclusion, the number of great worlds that he sensed had already doubled.</p>

  <p>Three thousand great worlds...</p>

  <p>These wills spread out from their original positions and began to fuse with each other across the great worlds. The number of great worlds that Luo Zheng perceived continued to increase, and the speed at which it increased also got faster and faster.</p>

  <p>Fifteen thousand great worlds...</p>

  <p>Forty thousand...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand...</p>

  <p>Three hundred thousand...</p>

  <p>Eight hundred thousand...</p>

  <p>As time passed, the speed at which the wills spread accelerated. But it ended at some point.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mind had already sensed over a million great worlds; a million and thirty-three great worlds to be exact.</p>

  <p>It was a very strange feeling for him.</p>

  <p>All of the one million and thirty-three great worlds were connected into one entity!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized he could sense everything within this whole entity.</p>

  <p>There were countless life forms living in each of these great worlds.</p>

  <p>They lived, cultivated, competed with each other, and multiplied in their own worlds. There were many secrets, secret places, and treasures, just waiting for the martial artists to discover them, excavate them, and explore them.</p>

  <p>But as for Luo Zheng, all he needed was a thought and these secrets would be exposed to him.</p>

  <p>There was a great world, a hundred thousand great worlds away from the one Luo Zheng was located in, where a war between ogres and Demon Night warriors erupted on a continent. Almost all the ogres were slaughtered by the Demon Night warriors; only a few hundred of the surviving ogres launched a counterattack. In a nearby great world, a grand ceremony was being held. It seemed that it was the wedding of a certain divine kingdom emperor.</p>

  <p>Whether it was a sect war, a mortal, or even an insect, Luo Zheng was able to grasp anything he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng had a vision, as if he was the god of all great worlds.</p>

  <p>What overwhelmed Luo Zheng even more was that when this will reached the edge of the great worlds, it seemed to have a tendency to ascend upwards. It went through countless ascending passageways, spreading out into the universe. At the end of these passageways were a hundred thousand supreme worlds, as well as an infinite number of stars.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was dumbfounded. Could this will spread to the Upper World? He wanted to determine if he could transfer the power he received into these great worlds.</p>

  <p>In order to see for himself, Luo Zheng flipped his hand and struck himself in the chest.</p>

  <p>In a great world that was tens of millions of miles away from Luo Zheng, a stone in the jungle of a certain continent suddenly burst in an explosion.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Zheng's eyes lit up, the corners of his mouth lifting into a smile.</p>

  <p>In theory, Luo Zheng had fused with the wills of all of the great worlds. As long as he was standing in one of the great worlds, he would be undefeatable, unless his opponent had the power to destroy all the great worlds.</p>

  <p>However, if Luo Zheng was to fight a Supreme Lord, he would be at a disadvantage. After all, if the Torch Dragon was to use its tail to strike through a land area, it would be possible to destroy a land mass. If Luo Zheng transferred the attacks of a Supreme Lord to the great worlds, he knew that all the great worlds would most probably be destroyed.</p>

  <p>He continued to sense changes in the wills of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>At the same moment, when Master Feng and the others felt this change, their faces became gloomy.</p>

  <p>"Is this the true plan of the sorcerer race?" Supreme Lord of Original Sin's face was dark.</p>

  <p>"They actually want to control the heavens! This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle frowned.</p>

  <p>As they watched, the Torch Dragon in front of them underwent a drastic transformation. Its huge body constantly twisted and shrunk. It had chosen to take a human form at this moment.</p>

  <p>Its previously colossal body finally transformed into the appearance of a petite woman. However, this woman did not have hair anywhere on her body. Instead, a slow-burning flame was on top of her head.</p>

  <p>After taking form, the Torch Dragon was still covered in wounds. But she stared at the various Supreme Lords and smiled coldly. "Sorry, guys.</p>

  <p>You've already lost."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a map-like rune slowly appeared on her forehead. The rune flickered like a firefly, which caused the Torch Dragon to enter a certain state.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was still enjoying his exploration of the great worlds, suddenly felt a strong will invade the will of the great world.</p>
