<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After several frustrated shrieks, the Stone Mouse suddenly thrust its tusks in a burst of anger and tried to cut off the black threads.</p>

  <p>The black threads were extremely difficult to deal with. Luo Luo Zheng had tried to continuously melt them with his golden blood, but a small portion of the threads still remained tied to his elixir field. To his astonishment, the Stone Mouse's tusks managed to break off the black threads.</p>

  <p>After the last black line was broken, the Stone Mouse didn't hesitate in the slightest as it put its pair of tusks into his elixir field and urgently absorbed Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was swathed in a numbing sensation which came from inside his body. He couldn't help the shiver that ran down his back. He couldn't resist at all, and it made him extremely anxious.</p>

  <p>When Master Evil saw the scene, he felt powerless and couldn't do anything about it. The Stone Mouse was simply too strong. Had Luo Luo Zheng completely controlled the little creature before it had hatched, then things would've gone so much better!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Stone Mouse had woken up on its own. It became a little demon after it had inherited the memories of the past, and not even a True God could confidently face such a beast.</p>

  <p>However, just as the Stone Mouse had sucked in a few mouthfuls of energy from Luo Zheng's inner world, it abruptly pulled out its sharp tusks and squeaked out in pain. It crawled out from Luo Zheng's shoulder and fell onto the ground. Its body was suffering a spasm like crazy and its limbs writhed around helplessly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Master Evil in Luo Zheng's mind couldn't believe what he just saw.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with the Stone Mouse?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body returned to normal after the Stone Mouse had retracted its tusks from his elixir field. Although the Stone Mouse had drilled into his body and he had suffered a lot of internal injuries, he was still able to endure the pain. He too, looked at the convulsing rat in surprise, but quickly realized something.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's attempt to absorb his inner world was actually a method of absorbing life vitality. In addition, it possessed a very unique innate token that enabled it to devour the entire inner world, including the secondary creatures living inside.</p>

  <p>However, the inner world in Luo Zheng's elixir field was formed directly from chaotic energy, which was highly toxic to living beings!</p>

  <p>It was known that in the divine land, only the Holy Beings could resist the poison contained in the chaotic energy and enter the worlds outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>As for the life vitality absorbed by the True Gods, they had to rely on the four great divine trees to convert the chaotic energy into vitality between heaven and earth so that they could properly consume it.</p>

  <p>The flourishing roots of the four great divine trees extended outside the divine land and were up to tens of millions of miles long. Those roots would get corroded when they absorbed chaotic energy. However, the four divine trees all possessed unique theurgies and tenacious life energies. When their roots broke from corrosion, the trees grew even more roots to take their places at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Once the Stone Mouse had absorbed Luo Zheng's inner world, so too did it consume the chaotic energy directly into its body. There was no way the mouse could ever resist its poison.</p>

  <p>After the mouse crawled helplessly for a little bit, it ended up being paralyzed at the side. Its small, intelligent eyes were now a dull yellow, and it spat out a pool of green liquid from its mouth. It let out another painful squeak before it eventually died.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy had always been Luo Zheng's most secret weapon.</p>

  <p>However, the Primal Chaos Technique was not something he could directly use. He could only extract the chaotic energy and use it as life vitality.</p>

  <p>Some people in the universe had their speculations about the existence of the chaotic energy in Luo Zheng's body, including Lone's broken sword. Still, none of them had figured out where it came from.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng was in the divine land, he had to be even more careful about such matters. Unless he had no other choice, it was impossible for him to release the chaotic energy straight away.</p>

  <p>The situation confused Master Evil, but he guessed that Luo Zheng's elixir field might contain a highly toxic poison. But what kind of poison could kill a powerful true spirit like the Stone Mouse? Furthermore, how did Luo Luo Zheng hide such a highly toxic poison in his elixir field?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't explain anything to Master Evil, but he was relieved that he had still managed to escape death.</p>

  <p>Since the danger had been resolved, Luo Luo Zheng sat down cross-legged on the ground and activated the energy in his elixir field to heal his wounds.</p>

  <p>When the Stone Mouse had drilled into his shoulder, he was left with a gaping, bloody wound. Even his internal organs had been injured.</p>

  <p>On the bright side, the Stone Mouse had helped him sever those troublesome black lines and remove the barrier between him and his elixir field.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to draw out chaotic energy to heal himself, his face twisted in horror. With the quickest speed possible, his soul transformed into an incarnation and flew into his own inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just completely lost contact with his inner world over the last few days, so he clearly couldn't monitor the changes within it.</p>

  <p>Yet in just a short amount of time, his vast inner world had already experienced a long period of development and the creatures inside it had undergone earth-shattering changes as well!</p>

  <p>When it had been under Luo Zheng's protection, the human race had progressed rapidly. Now, the several great divine kingdoms were powerless and a peerless warrior was born amidst the chaos? the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, which made him a peak warrior already in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Under the Evil God's rule, he had successfully reclaimed all of the shattered continents and formed the largest sacred place? the Evil Cloud Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>Moreover, he proclaimed himself to be a "god," and announced to the world that he, the Evil God, had created the whole world.</p>

  <p>At the start of the Evil God's reign, his words had been met with disapproval from the people. But being the ruthless Evil God that he was, he slaughtered anyone who dared to doubt him. Therefore, more than three million humans died in the massacre.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's inner world was in an early period and the total number of humans inside his body was only a little more than ten million. However, the Evil God alone had killed about one-third of all life form!</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that Luo Luo Zheng was enraged!</p>

  <p>At that moment, his incarnation floated high up in the sky and observed at the many continents below him. His gaze finally locked onto a grey continent. As the controller of the inner world, Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to know everything. With just a thought, he knew that the Evil God was on this continent.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew sharply as Luo Luo Zheng dashed towards the grey continent.</p>

  <p>He never expected that just as he was halfway through, the nine stars in the sky suddenly started to spin. The surface of the nine stars each formed a profound rune, from which a colorful beam of light shot out.</p>

  <p>Once all the powers the strength source had formed gathered together, they turned into a colorful arrow that was aimed directly towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe the scene in front of him!</p>

  <p>He didn't activate the strength source, yet the strength source actually had the audacity to attack him.</p>

  <p>Although the runes weren't powerful, they had already extracted the powers of the strength source. Thus, that arrow made from the strength source alone was enough to kill an ordinary world lord.</p>

  <p>However, it would be a fantasy if the arrow did kill Luo Luo Zheng. After all, he was the real controller of the nine stars. When the colorful arrow was only an inch away from him, he spat out the word "freeze." Then, the arrow immediately stopped in front of his chest and was unable to advance any longer.</p>
