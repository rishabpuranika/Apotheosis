<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4274 Removing The Curse </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The shock waves spreading across the sky didn't dissipate for a long time.</p>

  <p>The heat contained in these shock waves was astonishing, causing Zheng and Geoffrey to feel like they were baking in the sun.</p>

  <p>"The attack seemed ordinary but its power is so terrifying! I didn't know the Heavenly Ring Staff was this powerful!"</p>

  <p>Zheng originally wanted to say that the Heavenly Ring Staff was more powerful than the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, he felt it was not right.</p>

  <p>Both of them could make full use of the power in the Deep Space, but the difference was that the Heavenly Ring Staff was more intelligent.</p>

  <p>There was also a spirit within the irregular heavy sword that wasn't as intelligent. Even the downgrader had managed to bewitch it.</p>

  <p>Not only could the Heavenly Ring Staff understand human language, it could also make appropriate judgments and release the Polygon Extreme Form and the Pure Energy Extreme Form when needed.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the spirit inside had retained its memory?</p>

  <p>Zheng's thoughts were whirling.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Ring Staff is powerful, but I'm not weak either!" Geoffrey said, thumping his chest.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng's gaze focus on Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Right now, Geoffrey was twenty feet tall, like a small giant. His strength had been completely exhausted but he exuded a rich vitality, his every move vigorous. Zheng had never seen such a perfect body before.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, what has happened to make you so powerful?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>Not considering the Treacherous Beings, Zheng's body, which had been tempered by the ancestry-level bloodline, was the strongest.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was dwarfed in comparison with Geoffrey, despite being Geoffrey's father.</p>

  <p>He had been very clear about Geoffrey's strength before he had set out on this 'quest'. It was difficult for Zheng to imagine the kind of method that could enable Geoffrey to make such rapid progress.</p>

  <p>"It's not just the body!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey laughed, releasing the last bit of soul force inside him.</p>

  <p>His soul was at the top level in the Deep Space. Although the power had been obtained pretty easily and it needed to be further honed, the aura alone that the soul had released was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned. But before long, his face lit up. "I hadn't expected you to improve your power so greatly on this trip!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's head lifted proudly at his father's praise. He didn't have to live under his father's glory any longer.</p>

  <p>They didn't remain in the main world for long.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, time was precious. On the other hand, he was afraid that the downgrader would cause them more trouble.</p>

  <p>They collected Ziya's cremains before they returned.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for Ziya's sacrifice at the critical moment, the situation would have turned into something completely different.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's eyes misted as they collected Ziya's cremains. Ziya had been the only one to accompany him when he was exploring the world. He was sad to see Ziya die.</p>

  <p>"Us humans have lived through a thousand eras just to win this fight.</p>

  <p>Everyone should be ready to sacrifice, be it Ziya, me, or those human heroes. You have now undergone a complete transformation. You must have the will to sacrifice yourself," Zheng said seriously, noting the emotion on Geoffrey's face.</p>

  <p>No father was willing to sacrifice their children, no matter how noble the course they were pursuing.</p>

  <p>But they were now facing a life and death situation. All creatures in the third-grade world had no choice but to fight.</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Zheng patted Geoffrey on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Let's go."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey collected himself, schooling his features, his young face looking mature.</p>

  <p>He followed Zheng into the door without a word. They then returned to the passageway in the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the passage, they would turn into a picture after entering the painting.</p>

  <p>Before long, Zheng and Geoffrey were standing on the Eternal Scroll Painting. Zheng looked down to discover a hexagram array set at the door.</p>

  <p>This was probably arranged by the fox girl.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Geoffrey had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at the white paper beneath his feet, and then at the empty surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Let's go quickly before something happens," Zheng said as a warning.</p>

  <p>As they passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting, neither the fox girl nor the brush-wielder appeared.</p>

  <p>They arrived at the end of the scroll and pushed the door open, entering it and returning to the passageway that belonged to the Bold Conjecture House.</p>

  <p>Hilario, Kincaid, Dorothy, and the group of long-haired monsters were all waiting at the entrance to the passageway.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's face looked like it was covered with a layer of ice and snow; so cold was the expression she wore on it.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, on the other hand, sat beside his daughter, smiling. He had irritated his daughter, thus he was given a cold shoulder.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Dorothy would never forgive her father if Zheng didn't return safely to her. .</p>

  <p>The iron door creaked before it was suddenly pushed open.</p>

  <p>And then, Zheng and Geoffrey emerged from the door.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario shot to their feet.</p>

  <p>"I didn't fail you," Zheng said, raising the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand.</p>

  <p>To Dorothy, the Heavenly Ring Staff was a piece of wood and she didn't take it seriously. She merely threw herself into Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey stepped out of the door, shrugging helplessly at the scene unfolding before him.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Hilario, and the other long-haired monsters stared at the Heavenly Ring Staff in excitement. They hoped that this staff could remove the curse that had been cast on them.</p>

  <p>Zheng obviously noticed their expressions. He slowly broke apart from Dorothy but didn't let her go as he said to the Heavenly Ring Staff,</p>

  <p>"Remove the curse on them!".</p>

  <p>With a deafening buzz, the Heavenly Ring Staff absorbed the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, it needed a lot of energy to remove the curse.</p>

  <p>Dark green dots of light floated in the passageway one after another. The hair on the bodies of these people and their figures began to change, their hands slowly shortening and their appearance returning to that of ordinary humans.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy screamed and turned around, covering her eyes.</p>

  <p>The clothes of these human spirits had decayed a long time ago, and their hair had covered their bodies over these past years. But now that the curse had been lifted, they were all stark naked.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also embarrassed. He immediately activated the Truth of Three-Energy Construction and created some clothes for them.</p>

  <p>These human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House had been living in the form of long-haired monsters for countless years. Now that they had been restored to the human spirits, they played around, touched their own faces, and poked others' buttocks, as excited as children. The passageway was filled with laughter and noise.</p>

  <p>Kincaid understood their feelings and did not stop them.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, on the other hand, was staring at Dorothy, a puzzled expression in his eyes. It seemed that there was something he couldn't figure out.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, what's wrong?" Zheng asked, unable to understand why Geoffrey was reacting thus.</p>

  <p>"I've seen a person who looks just like her, a splitting image of her!" said Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng relaxed, not taking it seriously. "Maybe it's just a coincidence?"</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of billions of people in the world. It was possible that a lot of people looked alike. One would be able to find someone from the primitive land who looked just like Dorothy.</p>

  <p>But Kincaid asked, "Where did you see the person?"</p>

  <p>"In the chaos. She is embedded in the wall of chaos. Her entire body can't move. Moreover, she carries a Holy Item. I saw her through the light ray of that Holy Item," Geoffrey said.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Kincaid's expression changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>Zheng also realized that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>If a woman embedded in the wall of chaos looked very much like Dorothy, he was afraid that it was not, after all, a coincidence.</p>
