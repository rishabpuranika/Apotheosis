<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As much as possible, Luo Luo Zheng intended to maintain a low profile. To avoid showing off his real strength was his technique to gain a spot in the red circle. After all, there would be only three left.</p>

  <p>With his current standing, it wasn't going to be difficult. As long as he constantly dodged the attacks, he could easily face a group of martial artists at the later stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm despite the red circle's limit in size.</p>

  <p>In addition, his cultivation level wasn't enough to gain all the attention.</p>

  <p>He wasn't everyone's main target at that point.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, a fellow warrior had attacked him for no specific reason, aiming to kick him out of the ring. That had left Luo Luo Zheng confused.</p>

  <p>"Whooosh!"</p>

  <p>The air shifted as Luo Zheng's figure floated, circling around the edge of the red circle.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning, Luo Luo Zheng had always faced that same martial artist.</p>

  <p>'Interesting, ' he thought with a faint smile plastered on his face. He managed to maintain his calm demeanor.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng avoided the first attack, his opponent should've known better.</p>

  <p>Logically, he should've just given up. Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to cause any trouble and didn't even launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>No one expected for that man to keep on charging towards Luo Luo Zheng. He refused to let him go. The light that appeared out of his fist gleamed brightly as if telling everyone that he wasn't going to stop until Luo Luo Zheng was out of the ring.</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>The man sneered as he hurled another attack on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Huff? Huff? Huff?"</p>

  <p>Stealthily, Luo Zheng's movement flashed as he constantly tried to sidestep each and every attack coming from his opponent. Something was wrong with that fellow.</p>

  <p>That warrior had already given up on his defense and was focused more on putting all of his force on the attack. With that kind of technique, kicking someone out of the ring was going to be easier.</p>

  <p>There was no known conflict between him and Luo Luo Zheng, so what he was doing was completely unnecessary. It gave the impression that he didn't care about passing the exam anymore. He only wanted to eliminate Luo Luo Zheng even if it meant risking his own life.</p>

  <p>Was there someone else behind all of that? Who was ordering him?</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng could see Randy. He let his gaze land on the man.</p>

  <p>With his hands clasped firmly behind his back, Randy stood in the middle of the red circle. Faint particles slowly began to revolve around him.</p>

  <p>Even if the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors were in the middle of a battle, none of them dared to make a move on him. His eyes were on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I knew it. It's him!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said in a low voice as his expression darkened. 'He has always targeted me ever since I joined the martial house. What is his problem with me? Why does he want to make things harder for me?</p>

  <p>Did he send someone to test the limits of my strength?' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Given his current strength, Luo Luo Zheng could just easily finish off the man who was after him, but at that time, he was a bit hesitant. Something didn't seem right.</p>

  <p>From his point of view, the best way to obtain the Harlen Token was to move in silence. Even if the outsiders thought of him as a lucky guy, he still needed to keep it low. Then, he planned on using the token to enter the Feather Holy Sea to get life stones.</p>

  <p>Attracting everyone's attention was the last thing Luo Luo Zheng wanted.</p>

  <p>However, being targeted by someone like Randy from the moment he entered the martial house wasn't such a good omen.</p>

  <p>"It looks like no one wants to face up against Lord Randy. Even when he's just standing still, not one soul interferes. His reputation is just extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>"Of course! He is already regarded as a powerhouse warrior among his young peers. He is second to the crown prince and Edwin Xiao from the Dark Martial House. However, those three have yet to determine a victor.</p>

  <p>If they fought, I don't think that Lord Randy's chances of coming out victorious would be small."</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy seems to be fixated on that young man."</p>

  <p>"That young man has already run seven or eight laps around the red circle. He has been dodging all the attacks this entire time. Can't he fight back? What a disgrace!"</p>

  <p>A young man in his early twenties was enjoying the battle that went down before him inside the red circle. Nonchalantly, he muttered,</p>

  <p>"Disgrace? Huh! He has been chased by a martial artist at the later stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm for so long, but he remains unscathed. If you think that is disgraceful, then I wonder what no disgrace is!"</p>

  <p>The young man who spoke was the strongest powerhouse of the younger generation of the Jade Martial House - Gregory Zhan. If the younger generation of the Harlen Divine Kingdom were to be ranked, he could enter the first tier with the crown prince, Randy, and Edwin from the Dark Martial House.</p>

  <p>Originally, Luo Luo Zheng had always been unremarkable. Unlike some warriors who had to be trained in the Jade Martial House, Luo Luo Zheng was just an independent warrior with a cultivation level of only the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. No one really paid attention to him.</p>

  <p>Because of what Gregory told, everyone's doubtful eyes were on Luo Luo Zheng. "Is this man as strong as Gregory said?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Gregory who sang such praises. The three Soul Sea Realm masters who were watching the fight from the side were also looking at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They didn't even pay attention to Randy's performance. After all, he had come under the spotlight for a long time, and it was a foregone conclusion that he could obtain the Harlen Token. As the son of the ruler, it was almost destined for him to acquire a token even if all the other twenty-nine people worked together to expel him from the red circle.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were more interested in new warriors such as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although there were a lot of independent warriors who had grown up outside martial houses, they still couldn't compete with the talents of martial houses. The Soul Sea Realm masters didn't expect Luo Luo Zheng to be as strong as a talent like Randy.</p>

  <p>Out of all the current Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, only four could enter the first tier, and thirty-six could enter the second tier.</p>

  <p>The forty people in the first and second tiers definitely had Harlen Tokens. After all, both the Jade and Dark Martial houses, which happened to be sixth-grade martial houses, had a total of one hundred Harlen Tokens. The other three fifth-grade martial houses also had their own talents who represented them.</p>

  <p>For the Jade Martial House, it was quite a big deal for Luo Luo Zheng to enter the third tier and obtain the Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, only a few independent warriors of the Harlen Divine Kingdom had such an ability. Even if they did, their name list could have already been checked by the three Soul Sea Realm masters. However, the latter showed great interest in Tianxing more than anyone.</p>

  <p>They didn't know much about Tianxing's origin, but they didn't ignore his immense abilities.</p>

  <p>As an indication that he was having a hard time making a decision, Luo Luo Zheng moved around the red circle. He was hesitant to make such bold moves, but if he didn't, there was no other way to get rid of his opponent. He had originally hoped that someone else kicked the man out of the competition instead of him. During the chase, quite a number of martial artists were eliminated, but no one acted against his opponent.</p>

  <p>That was certainly not the way to go about it.</p>

  <p>At that thought, Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed. His body briskly twisted like a snake, and he suddenly rushed towards the center of the red circle.</p>

  <p>While he charged, he purposely avoided Randy. However, something unexpected happened. Randy originally stood motionlessly at his original position, but just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to approach the center of the red circle, he smiled faintly and then formed a claw with one hand. As he lightly waved his strong right hand, three sharp claw prints shot towards Luo Luo Zheng from the sky.</p>

  <p>Those claw prints moved at a great speed and had closed up Luo Zheng's paths in all directions instantaneously. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to pass through, he could only take them head-on.</p>

  <p>As for the warrior who had been after Luo Luo Zheng for quite a while, his Mu Ning had grown even stronger, and he had no other goals but to force Luo Luo Zheng into a corner.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's figure flashed as he traveled through space for a distance and walked to the other side of the red circle.</p>

  <p>The three claws that Randy had tossed missed him and went straight for the warrior standing right behind him instead.</p>

  <p>No one could have predicted that Luo Luo Zheng could travel through space. An obvious shock could be seen on Randy's face as well. The warrior who had previously chased after Luo Luo Zheng had his mouth open as he collided against Randy's paw prints.</p>

  <p>"Puff? Puff? Puff?"</p>

  <p>Three sharp claws instantly cut open that warrior's robe, and then a crisp sound could be heard. It seemed as if his protective armor had been cut into pieces as well. Then, dark red blood started to spray out of his body.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he had accidentally injured one of his own, Randy only coldly snorted. He didn't care about that warrior's life, nor his death. His eyes once again followed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No one knew what he was thinking, but after the missed blow, he remained standing exactly where his feet were planted moments prior.</p>

  <p>Since no one was chasing after him, Luo Luo Zheng felt much more relaxed. He let out a sigh of relief which he had seemed to be holding on for too long.</p>

  <p>There were only a dozen or so people left in the red circle, and they were still fiercely fighting with each other. Despite the intensity of what had just gone down, they still had the same objective, and nothing could stop them from attaining it.</p>

  <p>The battles during that round were a bit more intense than the previous ones where they fought for the last three places. With the presence of Randy, it became tougher. No one dared to challenge him. Therefore, he had claimed one spot as his, while the rest fought bloodily for the remaining two places.</p>
