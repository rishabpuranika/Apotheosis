<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3773 Too Slow </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The member of the Sturdy Bull race still focused on resisting the water drops. His muscles flashed with a bronze glow.</p>

  <p>Every time he activated his bloodline token, his blood vitality became more potent and greatly increased the toughness of his physical body.</p>

  <p>"I need to hold on for six hours!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>As long as he stayed within the tenth layer for six full hours, his tribulation skeleton would surely grow stronger.</p>

  <p>However, to do so was a huge challenge. After all, to continuously activate the bloodline power consumed a lot of his strength.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the current round of Myriad Tribulations Storm had just started. He was still full of energy, so the task was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Just as he sat down and turned around to check how the human newcomer was doing, he suddenly realized that Luo Zheng was already at the spot beside him.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened to the size of saucers. He stared blankly at Luo Zheng for a long while before he came back to his senses.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>He was so shocked as if he had seen a monster and not a human. He couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng had reached the spot beside him in such a short period!</p>

  <p>They were already a hundred feet into the Myriad Tribulations Storm at that point, and the water drops in the tenth layer were far more powerful. It was simply impossible, even if one's physical body had absorbed enough Body-strengthening Jades and had cultivated to its limit!</p>

  <p>What made it more surprising was that it was Luo Zheng's first time to experience such a trial, and his tribulation skeleton hardly even bore any damages!</p>

  <p>With a steady drip, the water drops kept hitting Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Black cracks spread all over his skin, but it looked like he wasn't in pain at all.</p>

  <p>Opposite him on the other side of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, the water droplets had quickly tempered his tribulation skeleton.</p>

  <p>The closer they got to the center of the storm, the faster the tribulation skeleton would be refined.</p>

  <p>The refinement speed at the tenth layer was a hundred times faster than that in the outermost layer!</p>

  <p>As the small drops of water poured continuously onto Luo Zheng's tribulation skeleton, its golden color became increasingly clear.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Then, it glowed brighter while he felt his body become solid and stable as if an invisible power had enhanced it.</p>

  <p>"Is this feeling from my tribulation skeleton?" Luo Zheng muttered with raised brows. Of course, he was a bit surprised.</p>

  <p>He was different from the Other Shore races, like the Sturdy Bull race.</p>

  <p>After all, he could withstand the Myriad Tribulations Storm with merely the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>In fact, had it been ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors, it wouldn't be long before the water droplets had exhausted their Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the special Truth of Divine Dao Luo Zheng had obtained, his Chaotic Source Spirits recovered quickly after an attack.</p>

  <p>That was why he could easily survive in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>"You, you... How did you resist the water drops?" the Sturdy Bull couldn't help but ask curiously.</p>

  <p>"With my physical body, of course," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Sturdy Bull's face twitched as he was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>The Sturdy Bull race was an Other Shore race that only appeared in recent chaotic eras. They didn't know much about the human race, and most of their curiosity came from the sudden increase of human Souls of Light on the Other Shore in later years.</p>

  <p>However, they still didn't take the human Souls of Light at the Holy Soul Realm seriously. After all, even though the Holy Souls were strong enough to fight against the Other Shore creatures, the Other Shore creatures could still become much stronger if they cultivated a Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>However, contrary to the rumors, not only did Luo Zheng have a physical form, he also had too much power that was beyond what the Sturdy Bull had imagined!</p>

  <p>While the member of the Sturdy Bull race was still in shock, Luo Zheng suddenly asked, "It seems that the refinement speed in the tenth layer isn't fast. How long will it take to achieve the same level of your tribulation skeleton?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's dissatisfaction at the refining speed in the tenth layer stunned the Sturdy Bull once again. He remained quiet for a while before he said, "It will take you at least a couple of months. Every time the Land of Bone Tribulation opened, I held on for five hours in the tenth layer. I have spent about a total of three months here already!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the time between the openings of the Land of Bone Tribulation was very long. Even if the Sturdy Bull activated his bloodline power to its limit, he could only hold on for five hours to six hours at most.</p>

  <p>However, he still stayed in the eighth or ninth layer to refine his tribulation skeleton even after he had already exhausted his bloodline power. He didn't leave until the Land of Bone Tribulation was closed.</p>

  <p>"Three months... That's too much time for me!" Luo Zheng said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>After that, he suddenly drove the bone plate beneath his feet forward.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he directly crossed the tenth layer and entered the eleventh layer!</p>

  <p>The water drops in the eleventh layer were much more violent, and the black cracks that appeared on Luo Zheng's skin grew wider. His Chaotic Source Spirits became twice as exhausted, but the refining speed of the tribulation skeleton also increased several times!</p>

  <p>The member of the Sturdy Bull race clearly knew the benefits of entering the eleventh layer. Once one was strong enough to withstand the water droplets in the eleventh layer, their cultivation speed would greatly increase.</p>

  <p>However, it was already hard for him to stay in the tenth layer for six hours due to his current strength. He wondered if he could hold on for even five minutes in the eleventh layer.</p>

  <p>In the end, he decided not to enter the eleventh layer before his tribulation skeleton reached a higher level.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng barely spent time in the tenth layer before he advanced further into the eleventh layer. Was his body strong enough to withstand the water drops' rapidly increasing power?</p>

  <p>"Easy does it, my friend. The difficulty of the eleventh layer is..." Before the member of the Sturdy Bull race could finish his warning, Luo Zheng had arrived steadily at the eleventh layer.</p>

  <p>He looked back at the member of the Sturdy Bull race and said, "Sorry.</p>

  <p>What was that you said?"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing... Never mind." The Sturdy Bull waved his hands and smiled awkwardly. He realized that his worries were completely unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The tribulation skeleton's refining speed in the eleventh layer increased greatly, and at the same time, the pressure Luo Zheng felt also intensified by several degrees. Even so, the exhaustion of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still within his control.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all the remaining Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm observed Luo Zheng and started to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>"Even if he cultivates some special token, he won't be able to hold on for long, right?"</p>

  <p>"You should know that his tribulation skeleton hasn't grown so strong to protect his body!"</p>

  <p>Even the centipede that fully concentrated on his cultivation in the sixteenth layer turned his head, his eyes filled with bewilderment and uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The centipede had reached his current level through step-by-step improvement.</p>

  <p>His physical body was already strong enough to bear the water drops in the outer layers, so his tribulation skeleton could grow stronger much faster. In turn, his enhanced tribulation skeleton served as additional protection as he advanced further.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had rushed into the eleventh layer even though he hardly spent time in the outer layers. His tribulation skeleton was barely refined, so it couldn't support him at all.</p>

  <p>If the centipede stayed in the eleventh layer without the protection of the tribulation skeleton, he wouldn't be able to withstand the water drops!</p>

  <p>Most of the Other Shore creatures who bet that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to stay long in the eleventh layer were indeed right. It had only been five minutes since he had arrived there, but he already felt dissatisfied with the refining speed in the eleventh layer.</p>
