<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1642 Ning Yudie Joined The Sacred Place </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Ning Yudie followed in Preston's wake, feeling anxious.</p>

  <p>With her bright intelligence, how could she not understand the situation in which she found herself?</p>

  <p>She was someone who had ascended from the Lower World and lacked any foundation in the Upper World. So what good would come to her, when facing those enormous odds?</p>

  <p>There was only one possible hope for her, and that was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, with her understanding of the situation, she also knew that Luo Zheng could hardly look after himself.</p>

  <p>He was indeed very famous in the universe, but his fame had not come from aligning himself with a certain power. Furthermore, he seemed to have offended a lot of great powers.</p>

  <p>Although Preston was extremely polite to her, she was not sure if the situation would play out in her favor or not. It might be a good or a bad thing.</p>

  <p>What Ning Yudie feared greatly was that if she fell into the hands of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, she could be used as a bargaining chip against Luo Zheng, which was what she didn't want to face.</p>

  <p>However, she had no way to avoid it.</p>

  <p>After circling around the hall, she arrived at the square in front of it.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all of the core members of the Pure Jade Sacred Place had gathered on the square.</p>

  <p>Thirty-two palace leaders, various hall leaders, stewards, elders...</p>

  <p>The combined Mu Ning which these warriors exuded was abnormally strong.</p>

  <p>Even the least of them was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, and there were also several warriors whose strength was unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was at the Soul Sea Realm, and those warriors that she could not evaluate were at least a half-step away from becoming world lords.</p>

  <p>These warriors also shifted their gazes onto Ning Yudie. There was curiosity in their eyes as they focused on her, reading her talent and potential.</p>

  <p>"Is this woman really  Luo Zheng Luo's wife?"</p>

  <p>"He is also from the Lower World. It's not impossible for him to have a wife and children in the Lower World. However, the possibility of her pretending to be his wife is even greater!"</p>

  <p>"Pretending to be his wife? We'll wait for the Saint Lord to use his soul theurgy to see if she is really  Luo Zheng Luo's wife. She'll pay a heavy price should she be lying."</p>

  <p>Seeing Ning Yudie being brought forward, the warriors on the square all began discussing her.</p>

  <p>Now that the battles in the Illusion Battlefield had reached a new level, everyone was especially concerned about the rankings.</p>

  <p>The strongest core talent of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, Josiah Shen, had also entered the top 70, 000 rankings, and his ranking was still rising rapidly.</p>

  <p>According to everyone's expectations, Josiah's achievement of reaching the top 100, 000 was already considered extraordinary. But now that he had reached the top 70, 000, the upper echelons of the Pure Jade Sacred Place were naturally all surprised.</p>

  <p>After all, they were only a tenth-grade sacred place, and in the entire universe, there were hundreds of thousands of tenth-grade sacred places like theirs.</p>

  <p>Of course, Josiah's results were incomparable to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current advancing ranking, the entire Humanity Alliance would place great importance on him.</p>

  <p>After all, in the three thousand supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance, there were less than a hundred people who were skilled enough to reach the top ten thousand.</p>

  <p>Under the visual scrutiny of so many mighty warriors, Ning Yudie felt a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>In the end, she followed Preston and they soon stood in front of an old man wearing a Taoist robe.</p>

  <p>The old man sat still on a rattan chair, his gaze fixed on the pyramid on top of the Illusion Space. Then Preston bowed to him. "Saint Lord, I've brought her here."</p>

  <p>The old man was the Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, the ruler of this sacred place.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Preston's words, the Saint Lord slowly looked away. It was probably because of the cultivation method which he used, but he looked exceptionally old and his movements seemed incredibly slow. However, his wrinkled eyes contained a pair of brightly shining pupils.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Ning Yudie and asked in an aged voice that crackled with authority, "Are you really  Luo Zheng Luo's wife?"</p>

  <p>The warrior who had been staying by Yudie's side was also a warrior of humble birth, but he had been born and bred in the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>After finding out about Yudie's background, he treated it as an opportunity and immediately reported it to his superior.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even imagined that this matter would attract the attention of the Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place. His superior had promised to give him a lasting reward if Ning Yudie was really Zheng's wife. The warrior could not pass up this opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am. I came to find my husband," Ning Yudie answered boldly.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord nodded slightly, while his lively eyes scrutinized her.</p>

  <p>"Look into my eyes."</p>

  <p>The moment Ning Yudie looked over, she felt that her eyes were captured, and she could not look away from the old man's eyes. It was as if her whole body had sunk into their mysterious depths.</p>

  <p>This was his soul theurgy!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie immediately realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>However, with her low cultivation level, how could she resist the soul theurgy of a Saint Lord? She was powerless to oppose him.</p>

  <p>However, other than feeling her eyes being forcibly locked onto him, she didn't feel any further discomfort.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Saint Lord wearily closed his eyes. Yudie's body suddenly trembled at being released, and she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>A few of the mighty warriors of the Pure Jade Sacred Place also turned to look at the Saint Lord. He then slowly stated, "Luo Zheng Luo had ascended to the Spirit Reading World of our Humanity Alliance when he came to the Upper World, and he was then sent to the Mist Palace to cultivate. He is an important member of our Humanity Alliance. Since you are his wife and you've had the good fortune to ascend to the Pure Jade Sacred Place, you will naturally be placed under my protection. Previously, Luo Zheng had been sent straight to the Mist Palace. If you are willing to, I can also assign you to the Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>Even though the Saint Lord was old, he could clearly read the complex situation unfolding.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't climbed up to the top of Illusion Battlefield, the Saint Lord wouldn't have bothered to do this. At most, he would have sent people to investigate and then help to settle Ning Yudie in.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had made a name before, he had only been known for the power of the fairy palace. Now he had fully proven his strength, and he held the 77th ranking in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>In the world of chaos, if Luo Zheng continued to grow, he would definitely become an extremely important figure in the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>If he could go further, he would only need a single event to launch his becoming the main character in this world of chaos.</p>

  <p>This had extraordinary meaning and boundless potential.</p>

  <p>Once that happened, it was certain that his achievements would surpass those of even Supreme Lord Illusion.</p>

  <p>Protecting Zheng's wife was a piece of cake for the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, this act of kindness could potentially gain his gratitude. Even a fool would become wise and do such a thing.</p>

  <p>"The Mist Palace?" Ning Yudie asked, as curiosity sparked in her clear eyes.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord nodded. "The Mist Palace is one of the most cherished cultivation places of the Humanity Alliance. Only the most outstanding warriors can set foot there."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, but I am not going." Ning Yudie shook her head. "I think I will stay here and continue to wait for Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Hearing Yudie's reply, the Saint Lord had a faint smile form on his face.</p>

  <p>"You can certainly stay here. Once the contests in the Illusion Battlefield are over, I can inform Luo Zheng of your location by using a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>But you know how dire his situation is right now. Several major races hold grudges against him, and they are not willing to let him go. He might be trapped in that fairy palace for a long while."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Ning Yudie nodded. "Thank you very much, Saint Lord." She bowed her head respectfully.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord added in a courteous tone, "No problem. It's just a small matter. In the meantime, you can train in our Pure Jade Force House.</p>

  <p>Preston, take good care of her."</p>

  <p>Preston's eyes lit up at the Saint Lord's decision.</p>

  <p>Everyone would be willing to do this kind of thing. It was not a difficult thing to accept Ning Yudie as a disciple. Forgetting her talent, everyone knew that Luo Zheng had a promising future. It would not be a bad idea for Preston to help Zheng's wife. It could then earn him Zheng's gratitude and perhaps even his friendship.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Saint Lord had already used his soul theurgy to confirm that this woman was indeed Zheng's wife.</p>

  <p>A warrior could have many women on his travels, but he only had a single wife. She was likely of great importance to him as well.</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to cultivate right now." Yudie's gaze turned upon the pyramid. "I want to stay here and watch the rankings."</p>

  <p>"This is just a small matter. I will stay with you to watch," Preston said with a smile. He purposely found a good spot on the square for her.</p>

  <p>Only now did Ning Yudie become an official disciple of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, and she was even allowed to step into the very core of the sacred place, the Pure Jade Force House.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie had first heard about the Pure Jade Force House, she had also yearned for it. She had still been considering whether her husband was qualified to enter, but now, the Saint Lord had allowed her to enter the force house simply because he knew of her relationship with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Ning Yudie felt light-hearted and it was as if she had stepped into a dream.</p>

  <p>What had her husband done to make the warriors in the Upper World think so highly of him?</p>

  <p>Obviously, she didn't know about Zheng's performance in Passing the Torch, nor did she know that the few Supreme Lords in the Humanity Alliance were all silently watching his every move.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" Looking into the distance, she saw Zheng's name. He was now ranked 77th. A proud look set her face to glowing. "Unknown to me, he's already reached this point."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie recalled that when she had first met Luo Zheng, he had only been at the nature level. A myriad of emotions flooded her at this moment.</p>
