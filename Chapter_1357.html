<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All divine weapons had great, impressive origins, not to mention the first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Even though the Thunder Wind Divine Sword couldn't be ranked within the Universe Spirit Tablet, it was definitely a masterpiece that one couldn't deny.</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao was the owner of this sword. In the past, he had only been able to create three Nether God Shadows simultaneously, when he wielded the sword. According to the description of the Nether God Mind Method, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword could only produce three Nether God Shadows at most.</p>

  <p>It was not that Kyron's sword technique was not fast enough. With his high cultivation level, his understanding of sword techniques was not something that Luo Luo Zheng could compare with. It was just that when the fourth Nether God Shadow appeared, the first Nether God Shadow disappeared so as to maintain the balance. It meant that only three Nether God Shadows could appear at the same time, regardless if a new Nether God Shadow appeared or not.</p>

  <p>But now, when Luo Luo Zheng casually struck out with his Thunder Wind Divine Sword, ten Nether God Shadows appeared side by side. He had undoubtedly broken the rules of the Nether God Mind Method.</p>

  <p>As for the reason, Luo Luo Zheng could not explain it, but he could only attribute it to the chaotic energy. It seemed that the effects of the cultivation methods and the laws activated by the chaotic energy were increased by a lot, hence also increasing the number of Nether God Shadows. It was the only plausible explanation that Luo Luo Zheng could come up with, although he had no way to prove it.</p>

  <p>Besides, his attention was mostly on the Nether God Shadows and not the reason why they appeared. He must admit that this method was quite interesting.</p>

  <p>Using the Nether God Shadows, Luo Luo Zheng created countless battle techniques, such as a few strikes where the Nether God Shadows were coordinating with each other, or just using the huge-crowd tactics to attack all at once.</p>

  <p>There was indeed much more room to improve and he was willing to grind until the technique reached its full potential.</p>

  <p>In addition to these Nether God Shadows, Luo Luo Zheng had his own sword spirit? Xun. She could hide amongst the Nether Divine Shadows to carry out assassination.</p>

  <p>Now that she had recovered most of her soul power and possessed the Silver Fighting Soul, she would be able to kill even powerful masters if she caught them off guard...</p>

  <p>The news that Luo Luo Zheng took the Thunder Wind Divine Sword after entering the Mist Palace had quickly caught other warriors' attention. They couldn't believe that he was able to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>As for that sword attack performed by Luo Luo Zheng, it had been widely spread and discussed by others in the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Ice Cloud House did not dare provoke Luo Luo Zheng, but the warriors of the Swallow Cloud House were very concerned about this matter. Some of the talents even threatened to challenge Luo Luo Zheng, as though they were not aware of the dangers they'd be facing once Luo Luo Zheng took up the challenge.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, several top talented warriors from the Swallow Cloud House reacted indifferently as they didn't have much interest in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, those super talents were still quite reserved. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was indeed attractive, but if they took action against a Life and Death Realm newcomer because of a minor matter like this, their image would suffer.</p>

  <p>As for that remarkable sword strike, it seemed like they did not pay attention to it.</p>

  <p>Because the torch was about to ignite, no one paid attention to Luo Luo Zheng. All the talents were actively preparing for it. Through Passing the Torch, not only would they be able to determine their own status, they would also be able to receive some extraordinary rewards. This event was far more important than a newcomer's sword technique as far as they were concerned.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng and whatever he did in the Mist Palace slowly faded and were soon forgotten.</p>

  <p>It was just perfect for Luo Luo Zheng as he also didn't want to stir up trouble. Now that no one was keeping an eye on him, he was relieved and happy to be free. He could now do anything as he pleased.</p>

  <p>He spent each day on cultivation, consolidation, or new comprehension.</p>

  <p>He was even thinking about helping Xun get another spear.</p>

  <p>With the current strength of Xun's soul, she actually didn't match up well with Luo Zheng's sword spirit. However, she could be considered as an 'attachment' to Luo Luo Zheng by fusing with the sword spirit. Of course, it would still depend on what she wanted. Luo Luo Zheng would respect her choice.</p>

  <p>The problem was the spear belonging to the sacred weapon level also didn't match up to Xun's current strength.</p>

  <p>That was why it was important to find a different spear for Xun; a divine weapon level would be perfect.</p>

  <p>However, entering the Weapon House required three hundred life vitality jades. Obtaining so many life vitality jades was still an arduous, if not impossible, task for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He did consider borrowing some life vitality jades from Yolande, but Luo Luo Zheng trashed the idea as this was not his personality at all. He decided to put this matter aside and think about it again after the opening of Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>This sort of peace and quiet only lasted for a few days. Before long, the Mist Palace was once again in an uproar? not because of Luo Luo Zheng, but because of his neighbor.</p>

  <p>His neighbor was a woman called Layla, but he knew her full name to be Layla Ai.</p>

  <p>Layla Ai was brought into the Mist Palace by the previous palace leader, and her goal was to participate in Passing the Torch!</p>

  <p>With the departure of the previous palace leader, the Mist Palace's members had naturally arranged a residence in the Mist Palace for Layla Ai. She now lived in the area where the Ice Cloud House's warriors and Luo Luo Zheng lived. The warriors who just joined there would be arranged to stay in the same area. After Layla Ai entered the Mist Palace, she became the member of the Ice Cloud House. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Luo Luo Zheng and Layla Ai became neighbors.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no objection to this. Under normal circumstances, he spent most of the time staying in the house and cultivating.</p>

  <p>However, Layla Ai was truly willful and naughty! She was not as weak as her appearance suggested.</p>

  <p>After she arrived there for the first time, she told everyone that she would challenge all the warriors in the entire Mist Palace, including the warriors from the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House...</p>

  <p>She had used the Tiger Roar Token to issue this challenge.</p>

  <p>This Tiger Roar Token was similar to the Roaring Token. Of course it wasn't as precious as the Roaring Token and it also didn't have such a perverted ability to transmit sound throughout the whole universe, but it was still pretty impressive.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Roaring Token, there were also the Dragon Roar Token, Lion Roar Token, Tiger Roar Token, and all sorts of other treasures that could transmit sound. But the ranges of the sound that could be spread differed according to the kind of token. As for the Dragon Roar Token, it could transmit sound within the domain of ten supreme worlds, while the Lion Roar Token could expand the sound to a certain supreme world.</p>

  <p>As for the Tiger Roar Token, it could spread the sound over hundreds of miles. In fact, if some Soul Sea Realm masters could erupt life vitality, they would be able to spread their voice out to such a large range even without using the Tiger Roar Token. Layla Ai might be able to do that, but it was not appropriate for her to use her life vitality to roar in this case.</p>

  <p>But the Tiger Roar Token had the same function as the Roaring Token as it also could forcefully send one's voice into the minds of others...</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was filled with talents who had come to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Everyone was busy with their own cultivation, and even though sometimes they would be disturbed by the roars reverberating throughout the universe, they would not dare to blame those Supreme Lords who made the noise.</p>

  <p>However, Layla Ai had just entered the Mist Palace, yet she was already making a ruckus with the Tiger Roar Token. Besides, she was directly challenging the talents of the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House. Her voice was filled with contempt. It was not appropriate for her to do that.</p>

  <p>Her challenge was like a spark thrown into a sea of flammable oil and immediately triggered the anger of the warriors of the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House.</p>

  <p>Not only the warriors of the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House, but also some stewards and several vice leaders got angry. They were disgusted with Layla Ai's behavior. When they heard that Layla Ai was sent here by the former palace leader, though, none of them said anything. Anyway, the super talents of the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House would go and teach this woman a lesson, and she would have no choice but to pay the price for her arrogance.</p>

  <p>Before the commotion, the place was quiet and peaceful because of Luo Luo Zheng and his powerful sword attack. When the warriors from the Ice Cloud House passed by his gate, they would even feel fear, for they knew that Luo Luo Zheng was emanating such power from the inside. They could not afford to make a mistake and get on his bad side.</p>

  <p>Now, due to the disturbance caused by Layla Ai, the entrance to his residence was once again bustling with noise and excitement. He was so unlucky to be this woman's neighbor. Even worse, their residences faced each other, so they almost shared the same entrance.</p>

  <p>It was early in the morning, and Luo Luo Zheng had spent the entire night cultivating. He didn't appreciate the noise at all.</p>

  <p>Xun quietly lit three incenses to help Luo Luo Zheng concentrate his focus. The faint fragrance could make people feel refreshed and at peace.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there was an explosion of noise outside.</p>

  <p>"I, Ryker Lu of the Swallow Cloud House, accept your challenge!"</p>

  <p>Immediately after that, there was a burst of cheers. It seemed everybody wanted to see Layla Ai lose.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Ryker. Do your best!"</p>

  <p>"This woman is too arrogant. We should teach her a lesson!"</p>

  <p>"Ryker Lu is ranked 79th in the Swallow Cloud House. This woman shouldn't be a match for him..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could not help but reveal an amused yet annoyed smile on his face.</p>

  <p>This kind of disturbance really did not stop whether he liked it or not.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, there had been four or five warriors who had come to challenge Layla Ai. Moreover, they were all from the Swallow Cloud House, including the warriors ranking among the top 400, top 200, and even in the top 100.</p>

  <p>Among them, Ryker Lu was ranked 79th.</p>

  <p>The previous warriors had all suffered a crushing defeat while fighting Layla Ai.</p>

  <p>The more miserable the warriors of the Swallow Cloud House had become, the more they wanted to triumph over Layla Ai.</p>

  <p>If the warriors of the Swallow Cloud House did not win in the next round, this challenge would continue until Layla Ai was successfully defeated.</p>

  <p>That also meant the commotion would go on for a long time. Luo Luo Zheng truly hoped that Ryker Lu could defeat Layla Ai. Otherwise, he would have to suffer through the noise every single day.</p>

  <p>Xun faced the door and glanced indifferently before saying, "This Ryker Lu isn't a match for Layla."</p>

  <p>The power of her soul perception was much stronger than Luo Zheng's, and he knew better than to question her. Even from such a distance, she could still determine the level of a warrior's strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng helplessly pursed his lips, wishing someone strong enough would come and finally bring peace to his mind and the surrounding area.</p>
