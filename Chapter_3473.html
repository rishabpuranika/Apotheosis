<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I found a buried temple at the edge of Stage Two of the Other Shore— the Heavenly Obsession Temple. Perhaps it was because it had been buried that nobody had found it. It was already broken, so people could enter and exit at will. This gem with internal momentum of Godly Way was right in the center of the temple," the Evil God said honestly.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Obsession Temple?" Zheng paused for a thought.</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said the Regal Jade Spirit, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>A single round of chaos already took an extremely long time, and the Other Shore had experienced over a thousand chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>During these eras, apart from the ruling forces, various super forces, ordinary forces, and even many major races thrived. Too many secrets were hidden among these forces— it wasn't surprising that the Regal Jade Spirit hadn't heard of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>"After I obtained this gem, I found another clue," the Evil God continued.</p>

  <p>"It led to a secret land at Stage Ten of the Other Shore. There, I found an underground cave that stretched for thousands of miles across Stage Ten."</p>

  <p>The Evil God was already extremely powerful when he was headed for Stage Ten. At the time, his infamous nickname, the "Soul Devouring Demon", was already very well-known on the Other Shore. By then, he could enter Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore easily.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the time, Zheng had already reached the Grand Sky Temple to explore the temple.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God explored the underground cave, he found the second Heavenly Obsession Temple— it was there where he had obtained the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"What a strange civilization…" Growing more and more confused, the Regal Jade Spirit sighed upon hearing the Evil God's story. "A strong civilization can enter a higher stage of the Other Shore. If the Heavenly Obsession Civilization is hiding in the Lust World, they must be doing it to avoid getting hunted down by enemies, as we are."</p>

  <p>The spirit paused for a moment before continuing. "Even if they wanted to hide in the Lust World, they were supposed to go to the Dark Region. It would have been safer there, right? Why did they go to Stage Ten of the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>Each time a creature on the Other Shore went down by a stage, their strength would be suppressed more.</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of Stage Ten of the Other Shore, the Civilization Artifact was still giving out strong power— it went to show just how powerful the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," the Evil God answered.</p>

  <p>"Has the Heavenly Obsession Civilization ever communicated with you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked him.</p>

  <p>"Communicate?" After a moment of thought, the Evil God smiled helplessly. "Follow me. You can find the answer when you see the Civilization Artifact with your own eyes."</p>

  <p>And so they followed the Evil God to the center of the world. Once he closed his eyes, a faint shadow emerged in the very center of the world. It was a silvery cube, spinning slowly in the air.</p>

  <p>"This is the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze fell on the cube— its left side was as smooth as a mirror, but its right had bumps and hollows, like it had been severely damaged.</p>

  <p>Even without the Evil God's explanation, Zheng knew how it was destroyed.</p>

  <p>While the Civilization Artifact wasn't completely burnt, it had been harmed enough when the world was almost destroyed.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God drew close, a cold, emotionless voice came from the cube.</p>

  <p>"You've failed the task of annihilating the Separate Abyss race. The reward is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>"You've failed the task of annihilating the Ear Mice. The reward is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>"You've failed the task of obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits. The reward is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>"Ding! You killed 4, 633 people in the Chaotic Source World, which reached a tenth of the total number. You will receive a third-class reward— a body reinforcing source."</p>

  <p>Clearly, the voice was narrating the Evil God's tasks.</p>

  <p>But it was a completely emotionless voice. Even when it laid out the Evil God's failures, it didn't seem to be criticizing him at all, like it was merely a programmed voice.</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 looked at each other in shock.</p>

  <p>The Evil God said, "Since I bore the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, only this emotionless voice has communicated with me. It continuously gave me tasks based on the current circumstances. If I fulfilled a task, I was rewarded."</p>

  <p>"Why does such a strange civilization exist?" No. 9527 smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>Staring at the cube, Zheng said, "The chaos has existed for such a long time.</p>

  <p>It's normal that all sorts of strange civilizations have come into being."</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, the Regal Jade Spirit chimed in, "I guess all the strong masters of this civilization fell asleep, but they had programmed the Civilization Artifact before that. After the Civilization Artifact chose a spokesperson, everything went as programmed."</p>

  <p>All the creatures of the Regal Jade Civilization, save for the Regal Jade Spirit, had fallen asleep as well. The spirit wasn't even awakened until Zheng and Elvinia barged into the black pool. If the Regal Jade Spirit was willing to fall asleep, the Regal Jade Civilization could have taken a similar path, providing tasks one after another, gradually increasing Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>From this perspective, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's method was rather reasonable.</p>

  <p>"But still…why is it so savage? All the tasks it gave involve somehow annihilating another race," Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>"I believe it arranges tasks according to the personality of the recipient," said the Evil God. "It gave ordinary tasks in the beginning, but perhaps because it realized that I enjoy killing, it gave me tasks about killing."</p>

  <p>Such was the embodiment of the saying, "He that lies with the dogs must rise with the fleas". The Civilization Artifact carried its own logic so as to guide its spokesperson in the most suitable way.</p>

  <p>"What an interesting civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit remarked with a smile. "Now that the Rebirth Land has been unblocked, Zheng, you can guide it into your own inner world and bear it yourself. But I wonder what Truth of Godly Way is to be used to bear this Civilization Artifact."</p>

  <p>Since the Evil God had been retrieved, so had the Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the Evil God had begun burning the Civilization Artifact, but the Civilization Artifact simply stopped burning without punishing him. The Regal Jade Spirit came to the conclusion that the Civilization Artifact wouldn't reject Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to the Evil God questioningly.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Goodwill and Malice," answered the latter.</p>

  <p>At that answer, No. 9527, the Regal Jade Spirit, and Zheng showed a smile.</p>

  <p>Excluding the Truth of Godly Way that was vague on Zheng's physical body, Zheng had already cultivated four Truths of Godly Ways in total. Among them, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was used to bear the Strength God Totem; the Truth of Cultivation Nature was used to bear the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization; and the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was used to bear the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction had been obtained from the space where King Manard was. According to him, it was used to bear the Other Shore Token in that world. It wasn't known if it could bear any Other Shore Token on the first Other Shore.</p>
