  <p>
</p>

  <p>With all warriors plundering Illusion Points from others, the entire Illusion Battlefield had now reached the white-hot stage!</p>

  <p>The expert martial artists knew that the best way to plunder Illusion Points was to enter the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>But entering the Hall of Causality was no cake walk.</p>

  <p>First of all, one had to get an iron ticket, which was quite a task!</p>

  <p>Secondly, one had to pay a whopping five million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the former or the latter conditions, an ordinary martial artist could never achieve either.</p>

  <p>The iron tickets needed to be obtained from a secret land deep in the wilderness, and navigating these secret lands, where unknown dangers lurked, was no easy feat.</p>

  <p>And the same went for the five million Illusion Points. After all, how many people in the main cities could accumulate so many points?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Illusion Battlefield in a main city of a supreme world, a gate appeared in the center of the city from which a blinding silver light shone. Nine martial artists sauntered out from this gate of light.</p>

  <p>The moment the other martial artists laid eyes on these nine martial artists, they were awestruck! They all knew that these were the true masters!</p>

  <p>After the martial artists had passed through the Hall of Causality, they would be transported to a particular main city. This city was often located in the center of the supreme world!</p>

  <p>This rule was made deliberately in the Illusion Battlefield to sift out the best warriors.</p>

  <p>Martial artists who passed the trial of the Hall of Causality and came out alive ranked in the top 50 of this supreme world.</p>

  <p>After departing the Hall of Causality, the masters would gather in the central main city. There was a high chance that there would be an even more intense collision there!</p>

  <p>Of the ten people who entered the Hall of Causality at the same time, only one had perished. The strength of these mavens was truly astonishing.</p>

  <p>"How boring! I didn't expect the reward for the fifth Hall of Causality to be this..." The leader, a long-haired man, shook his head and complained arrogantly.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. I am actually interested in obtaining a treasure from the Illusion Battlefield. There are some extremely precious treasures here!" said another bald warrior with a chuckle. He had obtained a Revival Token in a secret land within the Illusion Battlefield! This token gave the power to revive once to the one in possession of it.</p>

  <p>He hadn't perished during his expedition in the Hall of Causality, so he naturally had not used the Revival Token.</p>

  <p>But the entire Illusion Battlefield was just a projection created by the heavens! If he didn't use the Revival Token, it would be wasted because it could not be taken out of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that the reward for the fifth Hall of Causality would be a treasure that he could take with him!</p>

  <p>Naturally, he chose the Revival Token.</p>

  <p>This token gave him the incredible gift of an extra life. This was the effect of "Heavenly Destiny of Revival".</p>

  <p>The person who held the Heavenly Destiny of Revival was a Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Supreme Lord was unable to revive himself; he could only revive others. Apart from this, there were many other restrictions too.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, even if the bald warrior hadn't won in the Illusion Battlefield, he still made a killing.</p>

  <p>However, a woman in this group had a gloomy expression on her face.</p>

  <p>She was wearing a plain white dress that trailed behind her on the ground. A white brocade shawl was draped across her shoulders. She had a beautiful face, which was both elegant and cold.</p>

  <p>It was Mu Ning, who had entered the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Right from the beginning Mu Ning had never paid attention to her rank or Illusion Points. Unlike other warriors, she was totally unaffected by these things.</p>

  <p>Although she had promised her master that she would strive to do her best in the Illusion Battlefield, she wasn't very interested in these things.</p>

  <p>However, she had entered the Illusion Battlefield by traveling through a supreme world after leaving the Purple Power World, and she had directly entered a main city of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>What was more worrisome was that there were six main ogre cities circling this particular main ogre city!</p>

  <p>This was a land truly rife with danger.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Mu Ning left the main city in a blind panic and fought all the way to an unknown destination.</p>

  <p>She could not even remember how many of those stinky fellows she had killed. Her goal was not to fight them, but to find Luo Luo Zheng. They were merely obstructions for her.</p>

  <p>However, leaving the main city was not a simple matter. She didn't have a clear understanding of the rules so she voluntarily gave up resisting and was even killed once. In the end, she found that she was revived and still brought to the main city. So she had to slaughter the warriors to gain freedom.</p>

  <p>Thus, with the help of her sword formation, she single-handedly slaughtered the seven main cities of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>All of the ogre warriors then realized that this beautiful and elegant woman was a nightmare of a person.</p>

  <p>After that no one dared to leave the city.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning had a natural advantage to plunder Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>She used a hundred thousand long swords to set up a ring-shaped sword formation which encircled the main city.</p>

  <p>This move was powerful and deadly enough to send all the martial artists of the main city into a tizzy!</p>

  <p>No matter how strong a warrior was, it was impossible for him to slaughter the martial artists of the entire city.</p>

  <p>After all, there were exits everywhere in the main city. If one jumped over the city wall, they would be able to escape. No matter how strong the martial artist was, if numerous warriors fled the city, he wouldn't be able to kill them all. At the most, he could kill a quarter of them.</p>

  <p>As for Lucille's title of city lord, she had only received it because of the large number of Ji Clan's guards and subordinates. This was why she could set rules for a city.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was different. Her sword formation had trapped the entire main city, leaving no escape route.</p>

  <p>Be it the strong ones or the weak ones nobody was able to leave the city.</p>

  <p>And if they did, they would be killed. They had no option but to stay put in the main city.</p>

  <p>Finally, the ogre martial artists couldn't take it any longer. They eventually reached an agreement with Mu Ning and allowed her to kill all of them three times.</p>

  <p>After this was done, the group of ogre martial artists finally sent the nasty woman away.</p>

  <p>After doing this several times, she rose to the top 100 of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But later, she voluntarily allowed one to kill her once, losing half of her Illusion Points. Then she slowly got back up.</p>

  <p>So far, Mu Ning had not bothered to check her rank.</p>

  <p>Her sole focus was to find Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>But after learning that the Illusion Battlefield was divided into 50 supreme worlds, Mu Ning was crestfallen.</p>

  <p>This meant that the possibility of Luo Luo Zheng and her being in the same supreme world was one in 50!</p>

  <p>She had held on to a tiny hope upon entering the Hall of Causality, but she hadn't found Luo Luo Zheng there either.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, why are you unhappy?" asked the long-haired youth.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning glanced at him without any emotion before trudging off to the side of the city wall. She was too upset to leave the city and too upset to fight with anybody.</p>

  <p>As for the long-haired youth in front of her, he was said to be an ace talent of the Humanity Alliance. He had always been their leader in the Hall of Causality, and he had done everything he could to protect and please Mu Ning. As a result, she did not display much of her strength in the Hall of Causality, let alone make a move.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Mu Ning replied in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Killing people is the most desirable thing for a warrior. This main city is the gateway to the Hall of Causality, so a lot of powerful people must have gathered here. How about I accompany you out of the city to slay someone?" asked the long-haired youth with a smile.</p>

  <p>A warrior who could pass through the Hall of Causality was either an ace talent, or an existence that was only second to an ace talent, like a direct descendant of a grand world lord or a Supreme Lord. But this long-haired youth didn't care at all. When his arrogant words reached the city, it attracted the attention of many martial artists. After all, this main city was different from other main cities. It was the place where super talents convened.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning tilted her head and contemplated his offer. "Alright, but when we leave the city, I'll kill you first," she said in a flat tone, looking at the long-haired youth blankly.</p>

  <p>He chuckled, "You must be joking! If you want to spar with me, then I can arrange that!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not say a word and walked straight towards the city gate, thinking that the 50 supreme worlds of the Illusion Battlefield might have to join hands sooner or later. Otherwise, the talents scattered throughout the 50 supreme worlds would not be able to compete for the top positions, so it would be better for her to raise her ranking a bit more.</p>

  <p>If she was in the front row, she might eventually be able to meet Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She just didn't know his current ranking.</p>

  <p>After five minutes, a lightning-like sword flashed outside the main city.</p>

  <p>This was accompanied by the agonized cries of the long-haired martial artist. He had been killed by Mu Ning and sent back to the main city to be revived.</p>

  <p>As the long-haired martial artist was enveloped by the light curtain, he pondered bitterly: The mild, weak and bookish woman was escorted through the Hall of Causality by him.</p>

  <p>He couldn't fathom how she could possess such terrifying strength.</p>
