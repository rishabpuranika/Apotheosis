<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After receiving the notice from the two stewards, Luo Zheng headed back to his cultivation room.</p>

  <p>In his room, he recited a Truth of Divine Dao, and his Soul of Light immediately returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The newcomers in the other cultivation rooms also gathered themselves in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But what Feng Ge was going through was different from all the others.</p>

  <p>When her Soul of Light had left the Other Shore, her body remained in the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>As she finally entered the Other Shore, her eyes began to flutter and open in the stronghold.</p>

  <p>She got up and carefully examined her body, trying to familiarize herself before walking outside.</p>

  <p>At this time of the day, many disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had gathered together. Some gasped and others whispered when seeing Feng Ge walking out.</p>

  <p>Few people knew that she had a physical body at the Other Shore. So they were much surprised seeing she walk out like a creature at this place.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had so many options to cover up her identity. For instance, she could wear a veil to hide her face.</p>

  <p>However, people from the Bearing race and other races had already seen her, so there was no point to hide.</p>

  <p>A lot of newcomers of the Land of Sword Grief had arrived. Surprisingly, even Sally, Hutton and other Nine Li warriors had gathered here too. But for some reason, Chaim was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, he had entered the Other Shore in advance after the intense fights in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, he had descended from Stage Thirteen down to Stage Four to obtain some necessary resources for their breakthrough to Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>More than an hour had passed and people could finally spot Chaim heading towards them.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to have worried everyone," said Chaim with a smile. The space ring in his hand began to glimmer, from which dark gold wheels started to appear. "Although you have already reached the Chaotic Source Realm, you still need a matchable Other Shore Token to become a real Chaotic Source Realm warrior," he explained. "Once in Stage Fourteen, you should fuse with a new one. Only then will you have the real strength of the Chaotic Source Realm. If all of this is accomplished, you won't have any more problems in challenging others in the Land of Sword Grief! These Cloud Flying Wheels are the key to ascend to Stage Fourteen. Lucky for you guys, I'll be giving one to each of you."</p>

  <p>The people he was addressing were all newcomers to the Chaotic Source Realm. The thing that separated them and those high-level ones at the same realm was, in fact, the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Apart from Luo Zheng, Feng Ge and Dorothy, the rest of the people's Other Shore Tokens only had no more than one thousand Jun of force. To fuse with better Other Shore Tokens was something they needed to do now.</p>

  <p>As Chaim was distributing the Cloud Flying Wheels one by one, Luo Zheng asked in a low voice, "Can I have one more of this?"</p>

  <p>A smile graced Chaim's blurry face. He then held out two Cloud Flying Wheels and handed them to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As he finished distributing the wheels, Chaim turned back and took out finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace had spent heavily at this point in time. It had taken out almost all the soul crystal it had accumulated over the years.</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. The closing of the Chaotic Source World meant that there would be no new Chaotic Source Realm warriors in the future. The Taiyi Heaven Palace had used all its resources on the last batch of Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The sight of the crystal excited many disciples. They began absorbing the soul crystal as soon as they got it.</p>

  <p>After they had gotten ready, they all left for the other end of Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>They didn't see many Souls of Light along the way.</p>

  <p>If a person managed to step in Stage Thirteen, he or she had already been taken to the Chaotic Source World last time.</p>

  <p>Those who couldn't enter the Chaotic Source World belonged to minor sects or weak forces.</p>

  <p>After the members of many super forces returned to their own races, they began to enter Stage Fourteen all at once. This was not the case for Luo Zheng, though. He and his companions had been delayed for a few days at Li Shan mountain. In fact, they might be the last batch of people heading to Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>As they passed by the Dark Region, Luo Zheng kept looking into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Likewise, Feng Ge concentrated and watched very carefully. She whispered to Luo Zheng, "Do you think the three-eyed boy is still in there?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, "Yes, I think so."</p>

  <p>The last time they were there, they were forced by the three-eyed boy to make countless candles.</p>

  <p>But then accidentally, Feng Ge became a purified being while Luo Zheng inherited the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the three-eyed boy seemed to be against Blood Assembly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no clue if they would ever come across each other again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dorothy had only been listening to their whispers, but kept silent. She seemed quite down.</p>

  <p>Since she and Luo Zheng had entered the Other Shore, the two had had some secrets to one another that others were clueless to. However, after the events that unfolded in the Dark Region, Feng Ge suddenly became involved.</p>

  <p>On the other end of Stage Thirteen, there were many huge, scattered temples.</p>

  <p>Most of the temples had already been explored, and each of them recorded a civilization of the past.</p>

  <p>Hence, the group of Luo Zheng merely passed these temples and continued to move forward. The darkness on both sides continued to spread out towards the center of the road, making it a narrow belt. It seemed that the narrowest place was five feet wide.</p>

  <p>"Twitter twitter."</p>

  <p>"Hiss."</p>

  <p>The creatures that roamed in the darkness seemed to be moving.</p>

  <p>At one point, they even began to hear some voices. This brought chills down their spines.</p>

  <p>"The road seems to be growing narrower by the minute..."</p>

  <p>"The Dark Region is expanding fast. It's only a matter of time until this road is completely consumed by darkness."</p>

  <p>"What if the creatures in the Dark Region begin to rush out at us?"</p>

  <p>Sally asked, holding on to Hutton's clothes tightly. Nothing frightened her more than being killed in Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Noticing the fear in her, Chaim reassured them, "Don't be afraid, everyone!</p>

  <p>The Dark Region is forbidden to us, as much as the Light Region is forbidden to the creatures in the Dark Region. If they come here, they will die for sure."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Luo Zheng agreed. "We'll be fine."</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng finished speaking, several tentacles suddenly squirmed from the Dark Region beside him. They began to make their way towards the light, and for some reason, were unharmed. These tentacles belonged to a plant, and its dark green skin could tolerate the Light Region for a short while!</p>

  <p>"Hiss hiss hiss."</p>

  <p>The tentacles had begun to melt gradually in the light. But before they could completely melt, they had already wrapped themselves around Luo Zheng's neck and dragged him to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Look!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Watch out..."</p>

  <p>The others, who had just been reassured of their protection in the light, had no idea what to do.</p>

  <p>And even if they did have a plan, it might not have been enough to save Luo Zheng in time.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Feng Ge moved quickly and waved her hands at the sky, shedding bright light to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The demon plant screamed in agony, twisting and hissing madly from the effect of Feng Ge's light.</p>

  <p>Just like that, the plant had completely melted.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng's Soul of Light had been dragged into the Dark Region, the light led by Feng Ge protected him from further damage.</p>
