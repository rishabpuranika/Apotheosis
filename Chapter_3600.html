<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Elvinia agreed that she and Zheng should stop, she was still highly concerned about the Moon Fire Slaves' movements.</p>

  <p>Seeing that they stopped as well, she finally sighed in relief. "They've stopped too. They can only withstand a limited amount of power."</p>

  <p>Zheng found some relief in that as well. It didn't look like the Moon Fire Slaves were about to catch up.</p>

  <p>But a few seconds later, they began moving forward once again.</p>

  <p>After No. 13 halted, No. 12 continued on.</p>

  <p>This strategy gave them a great advantage.</p>

  <p>"Now it's my turn!" Elvinia called out without turning to Zheng.</p>

  <p>While she couldn't use the Chaotic Source Spirits in her current form, her corporeal body had refined a great number of Body-strengthening Jades. By no means was she weak.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could say a word, Elvinia frowned. "I'm not useless!"</p>

  <p>She knew Zheng didn't want her to help because he was worried about her safety, but she couldn't let him take on everything by himself. He needed her, and Elvinia was well aware of it.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Elvinia flew over first.</p>

  <p>The centipede had been on guard against Zheng, so Elvinia managed to find a good spot from far away. Even as the centipede reacted quickly, Elvinia managed to extinguish the black flame first.</p>

  <p>Then, she turned to Zheng and said, "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Very good!" He gave her a thumbs up.</p>

  <p>"I will go on then!"</p>

  <p>Without pausing, Elvinia took a moment to observe the scene before rushing on to the next lamp post.</p>

  <p>Both of the two groups moved along the posts at the same speed, maintaining a constant distance between them.</p>

  <p>After some time, Zheng felt a sudden vibration from the gray marks on his body— all the wounds he had gotten exploded simultaneously.</p>

  <p>He had absorbed a massive amount of Body-strengthening Jades, and the Chaotic Source Spirits had almost reached the late stage. His physical strength far exceeded that of his peers. But when the gray marks on his body exploded, even he couldn't suppress the muffled groan coming out of him as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>The power of settlement had exceeded the limit that the Chaotic Source Spirits could bear, resulting in their fatigued state. But the Truth of Godly Way had soon restored them.</p>

  <p>While they were only fatigued for a moment, the power they failed to bear caused much damage to Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he had absorbed the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed and transformed his body with the Chaos Ancient God's blood. Otherwise, the power would have been far too much for him.</p>

  <p>"It's my turn!"</p>

  <p>Since the grey marks had been settled, Zheng could then replace Elvinia.</p>

  <p>In the process of extinguishing the Hidden Spirit Lamps, two gray marks were left on her body. Her body wasn't as strong as Zheng's— she was already lucky enough to have managed to survive them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, by then, they had already finished four-fifths of the way. The exit to the circular desert wasn't far away. With Zheng's speed, he could leave the Moon Fire Slaves far behind him.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the flat gobi were long, narrow caves, widely distributed across the area.</p>

  <p>Over ten huge mice were running wildly within the caves.</p>

  <p>They were the Extremity Mice— the natives of Stage Seventeen. Some time ago, the Ear Mice wanted to join them in the hopes of being recognized as their distant relatives. But the Extremity Mice completely ignored them.</p>

  <p>Over ten Extremity Mice left the caves and arrived at the edge of the desert.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! They're all inside now!"</p>

  <p>"The three Moon Fire Slaves are in there too!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>Scattering in all directions, the Extremity Mice began drawing an array on the ground.</p>

  <p>The creatures cooperated rather well with each other. In less than five minutes, a great magic array appeared on the gobi.</p>

  <p>One mouse pulled out a circular crystal. Under the light's reflection, it could barely even be recognized as a ball, but in the shadow, the ball disappeared, as though it didn't exist in this world.</p>

  <p>After the object was positioned right in the center of the array, the latter was activated. Unlike the rest of the arrays that were glowing brightly, this one disappeared the moment it was activated.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak, squeak! Masters in the void, come quickly!" the leading mouse called out.</p>

  <p>Just then, an invisible wave shot down from the sky.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The moment the invisible wave hit the ground, the south of Stage Seventeen shook violently— the mice surrounding the array were all sent flying.</p>

  <p>Two red balls of light appeared in the very center of the array, each surrounding a faint, human-shaped shadow.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak! Masters, here you are!"</p>

  <p>"Masters, some people are trying to enter the temple! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>By now, the Extremity Mice were speaking over each other.</p>

  <p>"That's why you summoned us?" A cold voice came from one of the balls of light.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Those two are not ordinary folk. The Element Spirit race has even sent out the Moon Fire Slaves!" another one of the mice chimed in.</p>

  <p>"Moon Fire Slaves?</p>

  <p>If they are involved, the two must be truly unusual…</p>

  <p>Do they have the Other Shore Key?"</p>

  <p>In the past, they had tried their best to fight for the temple but to no avail.</p>

  <p>It was because of the Other Shore Key that they failed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Masters, you must hurry— they've been in there for too long!" the Extremity Mouse said urgently.</p>

  <p>Like the Elephant Man race, the Extremity Mice were stationed there to monitor the temple.</p>

  <p>The two figures in the red balls of light took one look at each other before gliding toward the entrance to the circular desert.</p>

  <p>Seeing their masters enter the desert, the Extremity Mice all squeaked— hundreds and thousands of them then surged out of the caves They gathered around the two red balls of light like tidewater, and followed the masters into the desert.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure was more like a bolt of lightning than a person as he flew to the side of the lamp post and extinguished yet another black flame.</p>

  <p>When he looked up to the front, he finally felt a sense of relief.</p>

  <p>The desert's exit wasn't too far away— he only needed to deal with three more lamp posts.</p>

  <p>Only two gray marks covered his body. The larger the size of the Hidden Beasts, the stronger their strength. But even they couldn't keep up with him, so passing was no big deal to him.</p>

  <p>The two Moon Fire Slaves had already passed through the middle of the desert. When they reached the 'disassembled' Moon Fire Slave, they stuffed No. 14's armor and spiritual core into their pockets.</p>

  <p>It was the spiritual core that served as the Moon Fire Slaves' foundation. So long as it was intact, they would never fall to their death.</p>

  <p>Continuing forward, they saw the entrance of the desert suddenly flash with a crimson light, from which two blood-red balls of light appeared.</p>

  <p>The objects carried a special aura. From the moment they entered the desert from the gobi, Zheng was drawn to them.</p>
