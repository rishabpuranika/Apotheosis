<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1937 The Boundary Cloud (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>This kind of information was definitely not hard to come upon, though.</p>

  <p>After he learned that Luo Zheng had taken five months to step into the Spirit Transformation Realm, a look of malicious pleasure appeared on his face. Zheng's speed had actually been much slower than his!</p>

  <p>Looking at things from this point of view, whether or not Luo Zheng would have enough time to make a breakthrough and become a world lord was now uncertain.</p>

  <p>Nathan, on his behalf, chose not to head back into seclusion again after becoming a world lord. Instead, he waited for the other Godly Geniuses in the Valley of Time. Half a month later, the sky above the Valley of Time began to tremble again.</p>

  <p>The Boundary Cloud formed by the resonance of the boundary-forming power and the vitality between heaven and earth spread outward in a consistent fashion.</p>

  <p>"The speed at which this Boundary Cloud is spreading is extremely fast!"</p>

  <p>Nathan said as his eyebrows shot up. He had just achieved an incredible result himself, and he had no desire to be surpassed in just half a month's time.</p>

  <p>As the Boundary Cloud continued to expand, the cloud also continued to lengthen.</p>

  <p>Three miles...</p>

  <p>Five miles...</p>

  <p>Ten miles...</p>

  <p>Fifteen miles!</p>

  <p>Nathan stared at the growing, expanding Boundary Cloud and he wrinkled his forehead. Stressed sweat began to dabble at his hairline.</p>

  <p>The continuously expanding Boundary Cloud maintained a fairly quick pace. In other words, Nathan knew the Boundary Cloud's length would continue to increase.</p>

  <p>Eighteen miles...</p>

  <p>Nineteen miles...</p>

  <p>Twenty miles!</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Nathan said in a low voice while staring at the Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately but expectedly, the Boundary Cloud didn't follow Nathan's request. In fact, at the same time as Nathan had spoken, this Boundary Cloud had already surpassed his own record, spreading out now for a total of twenty-two miles.</p>

  <p>As the Dragon Flyer warriors saw this, they looked at each other questioningly. Nathan had succeeded a twenty-mile-long Boundary Cloud. They never, not even for a second, had thought that someone would expand a twenty-two-mile Boundary Cloud in just half a month!</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two miles... It's been so long since I've seen a Boundary Cloud of such a distance. I can't even remember exactly how many years it has been," said the Dragon Flyer race's leader.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer race had been guessing at the identities of Luo Zheng and his group of Godly Geniuses from the start, and now they felt that things were becoming increasingly strange. Was it possible that all of them could activate a twenty-mile or bigger Boundary Cloud? They had reason to wonder.</p>

  <p>Nathan stared fixedly at the cave at the top of the valley. He was uncertain who created the Boundary Cloud, but one thing he knew for sure was that he definitely didn't want Luo Zheng to be its creator. His level of concern continued to increase, reaching its limits now.</p>

  <p>He continued staring at the same spot and after a while, he saw Tianming leave the cave with his sword on his back. Only then did Nathan slowly heave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Despite his overwhelming sense of relief, Nathan was still surprised that Tianming was capable of surpassing him after stepping into the realm of a world lord.</p>

  <p>That said though, the truth remained that he would much rather be surpassed by Tianming than by Luo Zheng. After all, ever since he had participated in the Illusion Battlefield, Luo Zheng had been the one to deal him the greatest blow. Even though he had reconciled with Luo Zheng, and had even been saved by him, a certain grudge would forever stay in his heart.</p>

  <p>Currently, nine months had passed which meant only three remained.</p>

  <p>Once Tianming had become a world lord, no one else had done so for the following month to come. However, in the eleventh month, Kurt and Lucille broke through to the same level at the same time.</p>

  <p>Beneath the influence of the two boundary-forming powers, two Boundary Clouds appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Amongst them, Kurt's Boundary Cloud had spread out for sixteen miles while Lucille's had spread out for eighteen. These results were considered outstanding, even across the entire divine land. However, they were still far from Nathan's twenty-mile range and Tianming's twenty-two-mile length.</p>

  <p>The four gathered together and waited for the rest of the warriors to break through.</p>

  <p>And that was exactly what happened. Two days later, Xenia broke through and created a seventeen-mile-long Boundary Cloud. Then Karl, Lone, and finally, Lawson made it one after the other.</p>

  <p>The Boundary Clouds that they created were all longer than fifteen miles but shorter than twenty. In fact, no warrior could surpass twenty miles.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer race was very curious and kept a close watch on their group. In the past, a world lord that was capable of producing 15 miles of Boundary Cloud was considered extraordinary. They never thought that this group of people would have all exceeded this result.</p>

  <p>"I originally thought that there would be another world lord with a Boundary Cloud greater than twenty miles, but I didn't expect the others to be so worse off," the leader said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Their cultivation levels are about the same though, and the martial artist that made a breakthrough first has a much higher perception. The ones that came out of their caves later aren't as good as the two from before," an elder responded.</p>

  <p>The leader nodded his head. This sort of analysis was reasonable and it could be said that one who was faster than others in breaking through was much more talented. It was only natural that the spread of their Boundary Cloud would be wider as well.</p>

  <p>"From the looks of it, the Boundary Cloud of the last warrior in this group shouldn't be longer than twenty miles either," the leader said, as he stared at the cave.</p>

  <p>The last person he spoke of was Luo Zheng, of course, who was still secluded inside the cave. As the leader of the Dragon Flyer race spoke, Luo Zheng was actually still training in the cave, with his eyes closed.</p>
