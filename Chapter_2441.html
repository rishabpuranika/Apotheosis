</p>

  <p>However, the Sunrest Wood Spring was much too rare.</p>

  <p>Even in the Sword Clan, it was highly possible there wasn't much of it.</p>

  <p>Just moments ago, Zheng had absorbed at least a dozen pots of Sunrest Wood Spring. Even the Sword Clan would take more than a thousand years to accumulate so much Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>Despite such, the whole of his inner world had only expanded by very little.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was unrealistic to rely on this kind of spring water in order to expand one's inner world.</p>

  <p>After Zheng withdrew his incarnation from his inner world, he once again stepped on the flying sword without hesitation. Together with Yan by his side, he continued his journey downward, along with the other True Gods.</p>

  <p>As they continued working their way down, the quantity of giant bugs that buzzed around them gradually decreased, eventually disappearing completely.</p>

  <p>The surrounding area was totally barren without any vitality, but the Truth of Malice released from the Killing Zone grew more and more intense!</p>

  <p>Many people's eyes were red with anger, and there was a strong sense of murder filling the space, as if they would jump on one another and fight to the deaths at the slightest disagreement, especially Gage and Donne.</p>

  <p>These two in particular, were a little out of control due to their enmity with Yan. It appeared as though they wanted to get into a fight with her, but after Duke obliged each of them to swallow a pill, they ultimately restrained themselves.</p>

  <p>After confirming their safety, a few of the True Gods sat upright on their flying swords. Here, they rested with their eyes closed, all while keeping a certain speed as they descended.</p>

  <p>"Look! Down there! I can see plenty of circles on the cave wall below!"</p>

  <p>Yan stated as she pointed vigorously in the direction she was looking into.</p>

  <p>Zheng equally looked over to where Yan was pointing and indeed, he too saw the white circles on the wide cave wall.</p>

  <p>"Huh. What are they?" Zheng asked in a curious tone.</p>

  <p>"Those are the annual rings," Yan replied frankly, with a smile.</p>

  <p>She not only was powerful, but also knew more than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Or in other words, before they'd gone to the Sunrest Tree, Harold had taught Yan plenty of important information.</p>

  <p>"Are they the Sunrest Tree's annual rings?" Zheng asked anew.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A single branch will appear on the Sunrest Tree every divine era, and at the same time, the trunk will grow another annual ring. These huge annual rings define the Sunrest Tree's age," Yan explained seriously.</p>

  <p>The True Gods standing not far away also felt surprised as they listened to Yan's explanation.</p>

  <p>After all, the truth remained that not everyone had the right to enter here.</p>

  <p>Although the information wasn't necessarily important, it was completely impossible to spread outside this area.</p>

  <p>The four great divine trees were the divine land's foundation, and they were born very early. Many inferred to the birth of the divine trees as the time where the divine land was created.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you just know so much! Full of useful information!" Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>As she heard her brother's praise, Yan tilted her head upward and said proudly, "Of course I am!"</p>

  <p>Everyone continued to descend along the annual rings. They moved in a line.</p>

  <p>It took an entire two days and two nights.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Reinhard warned everyone to slow down, as they had nearly reached the bottom of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Beneath the sudden warning, all True Gods felt slightly shocked and anxious.</p>

  <p>Everyone had kept a very high speed as they dived down from the top of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>It was primordial that they avoided slowing down. In the case that they did, chances were that they'd fall directly to the bottom and the crash would probably be strong enough to shatter their bodies into pieces upon impact!</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Reinhard had warned them in advance.</p>

  <p>Everyone slowed down now and began to descend at a very gradual pace. It took less than an hour before they finally saw the true bottom.</p>

  <p>"And we're here!"</p>

  <p>"Yep! Actually, this is the debate venue!"</p>

  <p>"It's so difficult..."</p>

  <p>As Zheng touched the bottom, he accidentally knocked the flying sword with his foot. The flying sword spun once and fell directly into his hand.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, Zheng's Great Weighty Sword had been damaged in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. These flying swords provided by the Sword Clan, though ordinary, were high-quality supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng could temporarily use one of the swords as his weapon.</p>

  <p>"Now that you've arrived at the debate venue, you must follow us. You're forbidden from walking around," Reinhard called out to everyone.</p>

  <p>"Humph. It's said that the Other Shore Realm warrior's great legacy is hidden in the debate venue. Your Sword Clan hasn't found it after so many years. Do you really think we'll find anything just by following you?" a top-rank True God from the Bai Clan asked, as he sneered at Reinhard.</p>

  <p>Seconds later, another two members of the Bai Clan echoed, "That's right.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Sword Clan can't reach it by themselves and thus misled others during every debate over the Godly Ways. All these years, no one has ever been capable of discovering such a legacy."</p>

  <p>Like the Han Clan, the Bai Clan also wasn't part of the alliance of Floating Islands, and they didn't have much to do with the Sword Clan, either.</p>

  <p>The three members from the Bai Clan had received word that they had only come here specifically for the purpose of obtaining the latter legacy.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what they had to say, Reinhard laughed grimly. "If that's the case, you can do as you please."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The three True Gods of the Bai Clan shouted coldly in agreement before hurrying off in a different direction.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the Sunrest Tree, the messy tree roots formed numerous layers and holes. The environment here was complicated, and in the blink of an eye, the Bai Clan's three True Gods had completely disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>"If you still plan on acting alone, you can choose to leave now," Reinhard said to the remaining crowd, indifferently.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods present were otherwise the strongest group of people in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Following Reinhard's comment, one group of two warriors, and one group of three warriors chose to leave.</p>

  <p>What Reinhard had been hoping for the most was that Duke would take his men away, though.</p>

  <p>That said, Duke, and the True Gods from the powerful clans, such as the Tang Clan, the Leng Clan, the Mu Clan, as well as the Fang Clan, didn't budge an inch. In fact, it even appeared that they wanted to follow them.</p>

  <p>"You're just so crafty." Reinhard glanced back at Duke and noticed the slight irony in his eyes. He turned his head away at once.</p>

  <p>"You're so childish!" said Duke, his voice lowered.</p>

  <p>His biggest goal this time was not inheriting any specific heritage, but to prevent anyone from obtaining any of it at all. It was only normal that he wouldn't go hurrying off to explore the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Reinhard took the lead and chose a direction, bringing over one hundred warriors forward along with him.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the tree was filled with the roots with all kinds of distorted shapes. Furthermore, a few plants with peculiar forms grew in the darkness and the wet places down here.</p>

  <p>Purr...</p>

  <p>Purr...</p>

  <p>It only took a few moments before a strange scream could be heard coming from not too far away.</p>

  <p>A True God looked into the direction where the voice was coming from, and he quickly noticed a bunch of pale yellow Ganoderma lucidum.</p>

  <p>In fact, from what he could see, there were nearly twenty Ganoderma lucidums and they were all neatly arranged in a row, which looked very attractive, to say the least.</p>

  <p>"Can you believe it? The Ganoderma lucidums look supernatural!"</p>

  <p>"They are absolutely not ordinary beings!"</p>

  <p>Enoch and several other True Gods were a bit intrigued by the Ganoderma lucidums. Before the others knew what was happening, they rushed forward and picked them.</p>

  <p>As he watched them do so, Reinhard only turned his head and asked,</p>

  <p>"Solomon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" replied Solomon questioningly, who was standing behind Reinhard and taking a step forward. A long sword shot outward as fast as lightning.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning was completely fused with the sword light, or perhaps, it was completely integrated into it! It appeared as though the two had now become one.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the sword light shot out at a distance of over a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>It immediately pierced through the Ganoderma lucidums.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Surrounded by bright blue lightning, the twenty or so Ganoderma lucidums started twisting crazily as they screamed out in torturous shrills.</p>

  <p>Before long, the Ganoderma lucidums equally changed into groups of ferocious ghost shapes, standing there and contorting wildly.</p>
