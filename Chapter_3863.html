  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3863 A Huge Figure </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back then, Fuxi had challenged Gerald, but he failed. In turn, Gerald had taught him a hard lesson.</p>

  <p>What made it more impressive for Gerald was that even though he was in a bad situation at that time, he was still able to defeat Fuxi.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi had never accepted his fate. He went on to find ways to suppress the truth on the Other Shore since it was at a higher level than the chaos in some way.</p>

  <p>That was why when he felt the space truth's suppressive power, an immensely strong fighting intent filled his heart.</p>

  <p>"You want to take all my powers by just folding the space?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>Then, his arm swelled up, and he released his strength once more.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A mark of the Eight Diagrams and fist radiance exploded in front of Yellow Thearch, but it didn't have any impact on him at all. It was as if they were in two separate worlds.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch leaned against the boundary wall with an arrogant smile and mocked Fuxi's fruitless efforts.</p>

  <p>He calmly stood up and casually reached out his hand. The Yellow Thearch Sword suddenly appeared on his palm.</p>

  <p>Upon closer look, it appeared that the surrounding space was a little distorted as Yellow Thearch moved. It turned out that he was isolated in another space.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch gently waved his sword and leisurely walked towards Fuxi step by step.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a slight buzzing sound, a holy way with intense killing intent slashed towards Fuxi's head.</p>

  <p>In return, Fuxi punched the incoming attack.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, he missed, and his punch went past the holy way. They were in separate spaces that did not intersect.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Yellow Thearch's sword attack hit Fuxi accurately!</p>

  <p>Fuxi had restrained Yellow Thearch before, but that didn't mean that the latter was weak.</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound, and then Fuxi fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch raised his sword, and he looked calm again. Suddenly, he launched another sword attack!</p>

  <p>His spiritual sense flowed through as he swung his sword again.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A large cut immediately appeared on the ground, but Fuxi already dodged it using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>"How can you escape under Othniel's gaze?" The voice of Yellow Thearch boomed from all directions.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he seemed to have heard something and waved his sword towards that direction.</p>

  <p>As the holy way advanced, a passage opened up in the space in front of him, and Fuxi emerged out of it!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The holy way hit Fuxi again!</p>

  <p>After all, the Chaos Ancient God understood the space much better than Fuxi did. Fuxi had changed the space channel by using the Grand Teleportation technique, but Othniel pulled him back and the sword strike hit him again!</p>

  <p>Even though Fuxi's body was powerful, he could not withstand two sword strikes from Yellow Thearch in a row.</p>

  <p>He spat a mouthful of blood and chose not to use the Grand Teleportation technique. Instead, he flew straight into the distance.</p>

  <p>However, Yellow Thearch wasn't in a hurry to chase after him. He even playfully watched Fuxi as if the latter was a domesticated pet. There seemed to be an invisible transparent cover in front of Fuxi. Fuxi couldn't jump out of it, so he would have to return to the starting point.</p>

  <p>"No matter how powerful you are, you are still at the Eternal Realm. You can't fight against the truth."</p>

  <p>Once again, Yellow Thearch paced in the air as he slowly moved with his sword in one hand. Meanwhile, the accumulated power of the holy way in his sword became more and more intense.</p>

  <p>If everything went well, Yellow Thearch hoped to kill Fuxi himself? he didn't want to bother Othniel to aid him.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Chaos Ancient Gods were the foundation of the chaos. Once they participated in the mortal battles, the situation would become quite complicated.</p>

  <p>According to Yellow Thearch's plan, they were supposed to abduct Zheng while they helped Usman increase his strength. If they successfully executed both, then the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race would be forever invincible!</p>

  <p>However, things didn't go smoothly. Now that Othniel was directly involved in the battle, they might have to do everything in advance before they made full preparations.</p>

  <p>But no matter what, he was already invincible because Othniel coated him with a layer of space membrane.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch slashed Fuxi with his sword once more, and Fuxi dodged it using his fast speed instead of the spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Although he successfully evaded one strike, he couldn't dodge all the follow-up strikes.</p>

  <p>In only a short amount of time, Fuxi acquired several horrible wounds, and half of his face had gotten disfigured. He looked miserable.</p>

  <p>"So much for that!"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch's eyes glinted coldly, and then three more holy ways gathered on his sword.</p>

  <p>For him, Fuxi was just like an immovable target. If he couldn't even deal with Fuxi in this situation, he would be worthless.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As his sword, which contained three holy ways sounded, innumerable sword shadows flew towards Fuxi at full speed.</p>

  <p>Just when he thought that Fuxi was powerless now, the latter's aura suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>A bright green beam of light lit up his eyes, as if an immensely powerful life force was infused into his body. All of his severe wounds healed in a second.</p>

  <p>The green light only lasted for a while, and then it turned red. His aura also became quite aggressive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the next moment, he swiftly pounced on Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>Even if Yellow Thearch had the protection of the space membrane, a chill ran down his spine.</p>

  <p>Instead of swinging his sword to fight back, he instinctively dodged and retreated.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The space membrane that covered him exploded, and then his left arm was ripped off by Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Still, his decision to retreat saved his life. Had he relied on the space membrane and counterattacked, Fuxi could've killed him.</p>

  <p>He pulled a long face once he had landed far away. He also looked up at the sky like Fuxi did before. What he had been worried about really happened-another Chaos Ancient God had a hand in their affair.</p>

  <p>Just then, a giant scorpion shadow appeared in the Separate Amber Province and other hundreds of provinces, including the Bloom Divine Province and the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Many creatures raised their heads to look at the enormous scorpion, and all of them had mixed feelings: first was that they felt deeply attached to the scorpion, and second was they also feared it, as if it would destroy them right then and there.</p>

  <p>Gerald was the Chaos Ancient God who controlled the truth of life. In the early days of the Source World, Gerald could interfere with the cycle of life and even create creatures. Therefore, it was safe to say that all living creatures in the current chaos originated from him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he was the ruler of all living creatures. Not only could he create lives, but he could destroy them too.</p>

  <p>As soon as Gerald's figure appeared, another enormous figure also emerged on the other side. It was a gigantic one-eyed monster with a strange stooping body.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Othniel, who had coated Yellow Thearch with a layer of space membrane.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you figured it out yet?" Othniel's voice echoed throughout the hundreds of provinces.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient Gods also had their stands.</p>

  <p>From their perspective, the Purge Way was clearly in line with their interests. That was why Othniel was willing to help Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Othniel didn't want to fight with Gerald. They both came from the last chaotic era, and although they belonged to different races, their races got along well with each other at that time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he still tried to persuade Gerald to stand with him even now.</p>
