  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Lawler's reaction was fast, he was still nowhere near the Snake Spirit King's level.</p>

  <p>Before he could even think to dodge, the Snake Spirit King's tail had already hit him square on the chest.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge hole appeared on the Wine Basin as Lawler's body was shattered into pieces and the set of golden coordinates hidden under his wing was exposed.</p>

  <p>Duran and Orval exchanged looks and quickly spread their wings to rush towards the golden coordinates.</p>

  <p>Their loyalty to their king was absolute and they would do everything to protect him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>However, before the two Bird Masters could even get close, the Snake Spirit King had already lashed at them.</p>

  <p>Their hearts dropped to see the Snake Spirit King's long tail snatch the set of golden coordinates from Lawler. To their horror, he immediately put it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people wouldn't be able to destroy coordinates so easily and often needed a special space hammer to do so.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King was no ordinary person. "My kindest and most honest friend," he muttered with the golden coordinates in his mouth, "goodbye."</p>

  <p>Just as he bit down, a black light suddenly flashed ten feet away from his tail.</p>

  <p>As this black light reached him, the Snake Spirit King instantly stiffened in fear.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>To his absolute horror, the black light continued to spread and move along his body.</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings did not have bones, neither did those at the Snake Spirit King's level but this black light outlined his spine and skull clearly.</p>

  <p>"We can't kill Sheehan," the Snake Spirit King suddenly declared.</p>

  <p>Sewell frowned in displeasure. "Why not?!"</p>

  <p>"Because he is still useful," the Snake Spirit King replied.</p>

  <p>"He'll ruin our plans!" Sewell pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Just do as I say!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King spat out the golden coordinates he had previously put in his mouth and threw it towards Duran.</p>

  <p>Filled with great inertia, the golden coordinates smashed Duran to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was very unwilling to give up and wanted to rush towards the golden coordinates. However, just as he was about to step forward, his body stiffened. He turned around and promptly left the battlefield.</p>

  <p>This left Sewell, Duran, Orval, and Lawler gaping in astonishment. They absolutely had no idea what just happened.</p>

  <p>"My king! My king!"</p>

  <p>Sewell shouted as he followed after the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Retreat."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's order was concise and demanded to be followed.</p>

  <p>Sewell, however, was still unwilling and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We can annihilate the whole Bird Spirit Sect at this point. We can't stop now. We have to..."</p>

  <p>However, before he could finish his words, the Snake Spirit King shot him a cold glare and silenced him. "Do you dare disobey me?"</p>

  <p>As the second most important figure in their sect, Sewell was someone who served the Snake Spirit King with the utmost loyalty and devotion.</p>

  <p>This was probably the most serious warning his superior gave him.</p>

  <p>Sewell opened his mouth as his gut clenched in fear. "I... I dare not," he stammered in response before issuing the order to retreat.</p>

  <p>Almost all the Treacherous Beings on both sides had been killed. Even if Sewell did not give the order, the Treacherous Beings would still return after they died.</p>

  <p>Thus, the fierce battle in the Jade Pure Realm ended in such a strange, abrupt manner.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Divine Bell City of the Ruin Graveyard, the bell began to ring.</p>

  <p>This was a constant thing that happened once a month and everyone at the Other Shore Realm buzzed with excitement.</p>

  <p>Soon, many Other Shore Realm warriors began to ring the bell.</p>

  <p>Tianming was the most eye-catching one.</p>

  <p>The fact that he made it to the thirty-second floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was amazing and shocked the entire Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>With this feat, he suddenly became everyone's hope to reach the top.</p>

  <p>After he managed to obtain the Monta Stone, his cultivation speed increased exponentially and he was able to reach the thirty-second floor quickly. He now set out to challenge the thirty-third floor.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>After a long and melodious ring, he once again sat under the divine bell.</p>

  <p>Tianming closed his eyes and entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>He liked the tower's atmosphere very much and every time he entered, he felt a great sense of joy. Tianming had the impression that the owner was an incredibly optimistic person.</p>

  <p>However, when he entered, he sensed a subtle change in the air. It felt more dignified and solemn.</p>

  <p>Tianming couldn't help but take note of this change. 'Is it because I've reached the top?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He was already on the thirty-third floor and his eyes were already fixated on the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the tower made him straighten his back more.</p>

  <p>Tianming's suspicions were correct. There was indeed a dignified presence within the tower. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his four disciples had gathered in the tower to watch him.</p>

  <p>"Let Tianming get that sword," Dale said.</p>

  <p>Arthur nodded. "I agree."</p>

  <p>Justin was quick to affirm, "I also have no objections."</p>

  <p>"It's all up to you, Master," Derrick said.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded. "Back then, there was something wrong with the Lone Sword but Geoffrey was able to repair it.</p>

  <p>He was able to connect the sword to the eleventh stair and make it so much more powerful. Are you all sure that you won't regret it if Tianming gets it?"</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation at all as the four disciples shook their heads.</p>

  <p>They'd been trapped in this bubble for so long and their ambitions had long since evaporated into thin air.</p>

  <p>"I won't regret it," Dale confirmed. "We've deliberately trained Tianming and guided him to the thirty-third floor precisely for him to obtain this sword."</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey is still in the main world though and there is still no news of him. What if he tries to deliver a message through the sword?" Arthur asked. To be fair, he had a point.</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had already prepared for that possibility and showed them a blood-red, jade pendant in his hand.</p>

  <p>His disciples' expressions changed when they saw the pendant on his palm. "That's the Blood Soul Jade Pendant," Dale muttered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>This pendant was formed by the bloodline of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and nurtured by him for many years. It was an avatar he created and the power it contained was comparable to his own.</p>

  <p>"Summon a soul and I'll integrate your souls into the Lone Sword," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord told them.</p>

  <p>"Why, Master?" Justin asked. They absolutely had no idea why their master would make such an arrangement.</p>

  <p>A soul normally served as a back-up plan during a huge crisis but they'd been safe in this bubble for so long now.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's face became serious. "Since Dale came back, I've been uneasy because our location has already been exposed."</p>

  <p>"But the bubble can't be tracked. We've already changed our location and Arthur's already swallowed up the metal-devouring beast," Justin said, perfectly assured of their safety.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord could only sigh, "I know but I've been so uneasy these days. Just leave your souls in case something happens."</p>

  <p>Though they did not know what their master was worried about, the four disciples still did as he asked and summoned their souls to drill into the jade pendant.</p>

  <p>Their master then reached out and hung the pendant onto the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>The moment it was placed upon the sword, the jade pendant changed into blood threads that attached themselves onto the blade and seeped into the steel.</p>

  <p>Tianming couldn't see nor hear them. He also had no idea of what had just happened when the jade pendant integrated itself onto the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>Compared to the last time he saw it, the Lone Sword's aura had changed and the energy that emanated from it was extremely astonishing. It was no longer the broken weapon that exuded no aura. It seemed like a proper, powerful weapon now.</p>

  <p>Tianming felt it but couldn't figure out how it happened. However, he remained very interested in the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The big bell in the Divine Bell City began to tremble intermittently. Time was almost up.</p>

  <p>With a smile on his face, Tianming reached out and grasped the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>Once the sound stopped, he would automatically leave the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>However, when he turned around, he found an old, sage-like man in front of him.</p>

  <p>His first instinct was to ask this man for identification. "Who are..."</p>

  <p>However, he changed his mind halfway. "Are you the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did you show up because I reached the top?" he asked. Tianming wasn't that surprised at the owner's appearance.</p>

  <p>In fact, he figured that it was only a matter of time before this happened.</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "I want you to deliver a message to Mike."</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes widened. "Bring a message to Holy Mike?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for him to reach the thirty-third floor yet when he got there, the owner of the tower suddenly appeared and asked him to deliver a message to Zheng's father. What exactly was going on?</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head. He shouldn't think about it too much right now.</p>

  <p>"What's the message?" he asked.</p>

  <p>A small butterfly appeared upon the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's hand.</p>

  <p>He tossed it and Tianming watched it fly down and land on the eighth floor.</p>

  <p>"Let Mike ring the bell and enter the tower to bear this butterfly," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord instructed.</p>
