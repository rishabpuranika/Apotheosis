</p>

  <p>Zheng found his gaze drawn to a woman in cyan among the thirteen top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Although it had been several years since he had last seen Lucille from the Evolutionary Universe, Zheng thought that this woman bore an uncanny resemblance to her.</p>

  <p>However, there were so many True Gods in the divine land that there were bound to be people who looked like each other. So, instead of making a move, he decided to observe them quietly.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>Under Lathrop's orders, the array formed by the thirteen top-rank True Gods quickly changed.</p>

  <p>On the surface, the array seemed to be in disorder, but in fact, there was a profound meaning hidden in it. It seemed that Lathrop not only was proficient in the Great Dominance Technique but also had made great achievements in mastering arrays.</p>

  <p>In the forest, the old man of the Cyan Tree Clan called on the other eight top-rank True Gods to form the Cyan Tree Array again.</p>

  <p>Bitterness filled the old man's eyes.</p>

  <p>He had known as soon as he had seen Lathrop that this was a doomsday scenario for the Cyan Tree Clan.</p>

  <p>Although the Cyan Tree Array was said to be able to resist the attacks of consummate True Gods, it wasn't as strong as it had once been.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng had greatly weakened the Cyan Tree Array by breaking it earlier.</p>

  <p>But even so, the Cyan Tree Clan still chose to put up a strong fight.</p>

  <p>When Lathrop saw internal momentum circulating in the forest, disdain filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What they are doing is useless. Form Thirteenfold Poison Array. Break their array!" he ordered with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the bodies of the thirteen top-rank True Gods in Lathrop's control began emitting black poison miasma into the air.</p>

  <p>Waves of sweet smell wafted off of their bodies. It was obvious that the black miasma was extremely toxic.</p>

  <p>Lathrop didn't belong to any of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>He was both righteous and evil. After all, if one wanted to become stronger without the support of the rich clans, using cruel means to achieve it was inevitable.</p>

  <p>The Thirteenfold Poison Array required thirteen top-rank True Gods who were soaked in Phoenix Crown Blood, a kind of deadly poison from the divine land to make thirteen poisonous people. When they were faced with the enemy, they would release poisonous miasma to hinder and hurt the enemy.</p>

  <p>Even the trees and the grass died instantly upon contact with such poisonous people. Lathrop himself didn't dare to touch them.</p>

  <p>What was more amazing was that although the Phoenix Crown Blood was extremely poisonous, it could greatly enhance a warrior's strength after the poison mixed with their blood.</p>

  <p>However, this increase in strength would not last long. The Phoenix Crown Blood would constantly corrode the True Gods' blood vessels and invade their inner worlds. Within half a year, the True Gods' inner worlds would be destroyed, rendering them quite useless.</p>

  <p>So, every now and then, Lathrop had to capture more top-rank True Gods to be his puppets.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared firmly at the woman who looked like Lucille.</p>

  <p>The poisonous miasma wafting from her body was so thick that it almost covered her completely. Since the True Gods relied on their internal momentum to emit the poison miasma, Zheng had a stroke of enlightenment after a moment's observation.</p>

  <p>'Five Elements Godly Way!' Zheng exclaimed to himself.</p>

  <p>Now that he had discovered this new piece of information, he was sure of the woman's identity.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, Lucille had practiced the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Originally, Zheng had not wanted to get involved in the conflict between the Mo Clan and the Cyan Tree Clan, but now, it seemed that he had to do something.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood up ponderously as he weighed his next course of action.</p>

  <p>Although Lathrop was insufferably arrogant in front of the members of the Cyan Tree Clan, most of his attention was focused on Zheng. In fact, Zheng was the only person that he was really wary of here.</p>

  <p>Now, when he saw Zheng get up, the malice on his face suddenly disappeared, replaced instead by a hesitant expression. "I have a deep grudge against the Cyan Tree Clan. Please don't intervene in our affairs.</p>

  <p>After I defeat the Cyan Tree Clan, I will reward you with anything you ask that is within my power. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at him blankly and said indifferently, "Whatever enmity you have with the Cyan Tree Clan, it has nothing to do with me."</p>

  <p>A sense of relief filled Lathrop's heart as soon as he heard this.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng immediately added, "But there may be some enmity between you and me!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Lathrop's face slightly hardened. He didn't know what Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>But before he could even think about how to respond, Zheng disappeared right before his eyes!</p>

  <p>Lathrop had started at a grassroots level and slowly worked his way toward becoming a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>He had been in so many moments of crisis that the moment he saw Zheng disappear, he knew that he was about to be attacked.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As he had expected, the very next moment, Zheng appeared beside him and reached out to grab his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical strength alone was enough to crush Lathrop into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, Lathrop was quick to react. He timely activated Grand Teleportation, narrowly missing Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Then, he reappeared among the thirteen puppets.</p>

  <p>Here, shrouded by the thirteen puppets' poisonous miasma, he had some sort of protection against Zheng. "I have never met you. What hatred do you harbor toward me?" he asked indignantly.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't care to explain. "If I say there is enmity, then there sure is," he said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>He knew that if he revealed the reason he was going up against Lathrop, Lathrop would gain an edge over him. After all, the lives of the puppets were in Lathrop's hands, and they had no way of resisting his control.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With that, the pair of thunder wings on Zheng's back suddenly spread out.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he transformed into a streak of lightning and shot toward Lathrop.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Tree Clan was astonished at the scene in front of them. Until now, they had been terrified that they would perish at Lathrop's hands.</p>

  <p>Judging by Zheng's previous attitude, they hadn't even dared to expect him to help them out.</p>

  <p>And anyway, Zheng was neither relative nor friend to them. They had only wished that he wouldn't make things worse for them.</p>

  <p>But to their surprise, Zheng had started fighting against Lathrop!</p>

  <p>These desperate people now had a glimmer of hope in their hearts.</p>

  <p>The look on Lathrop's face turned cold when he saw Zheng coming toward him despite everything.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>The poisonous miasma on the thirteen venomous human bodies took the shape of tentacles and swept toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even a consummate True God wouldn't be able to do anything in the face of the poisonous miasma. Lathrop was sure that this could, at the very least, make Zheng back off.</p>

  <p>But to his surprise, Zheng didn't retreat at all; instead, he walked straight into the poisonous miasma!</p>

  <p>When Lathrop saw that Zheng remained completely unaffected by the poisonous miasma, his face darkened.</p>

  <p>At this rate, he would definitely be defeated, because the Thirteenfold Poison Array was already his best trick up his sleeve. But he decided to take a risk instead of fleeing.</p>

  <p>With gritted teeth, he abruptly clasped his hands together and then held up his palm.</p>

  <p>The poisonous miasma of the thirteen venomous people gathered in his palm. Mixed with the thirteen people's internal momentum, the poison palm was really powerful!</p>

  <p>Seeing that Lathrop was choosing to fight him instead of retreating, Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>He was pleasantly surprised by that.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he struck back with his palm.</p>

  <p>Although his attack seemed ordinary, the power contained in it was terrifying. Very few consummate True Gods would be able to withstand it. Unfortunately for Lathrop, he wasn't one of those few.</p>
