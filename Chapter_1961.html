<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1961 The Scattered Godly Geniuses </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Within the Fiery Rock World, huge chunks of rocks glowed red from the intense heat.</p>

  <p>Two figures rapidly moved through the embers. The moment their tiptoes touched the rocks, they shot forward with exceptional agility. In a blink of an eye, they traveled over ten miles.</p>

  <p>Behind these two figures was a grand world lord of the Sacred race that chased after them!</p>

  <p>Those two people were Lucille and Nathan!</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had indeed sent the Godly Geniuses back to the Evolutionary Universe, however, the Grand Space Spell made it so that the nine of them were scattered all over the universe.</p>

  <p>Lucille and Nathan fell into the Fiery Rock World together.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this world belonged to the Humanity Alliance and was located in the depths of many supreme worlds controlled by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Their arrival quickly alarmed the Sacred race which in turn led to them getting chased all over the place by a grand world lord.</p>

  <p>This hot pursuit, both literally and figuratively, lasted three days and three nights.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape," the grand world lord said, his voice echoing in the sky.</p>

  <p>Both Lucille and Nathan had used Grand Teleportation multiple times but were still unable to shake off the grand world lord that chased after them.</p>

  <p>The two of them had just recently become world lords and their level wasn't stable yet. It would be extremely difficult for them to defeat their pursuer even if they joined forces.</p>

  <p>The grand world lord suddenly flew higher. There was a cold smile on his face as he looked down at the two young warriors.</p>

  <p>These two were nothing more than tiny mice scurrying about in his territory.</p>

  <p>"Sky Crush!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand and formed a mysterious seal.</p>

  <p>Black rays of light appeared in the sky and continuously spread to form a shape. It seem as if a corner of the horizon had been cut off to be shaped into a dark, formidable hand, which came crushing down.</p>

  <p>Nathan's eyes flashed as he looked up at what was happening. "Grand Teleportation!"</p>

  <p>Lucille nodded before a bright flash appeared underneath their feet and made them disappear.</p>

  <p>Their pursuer sneered. He too employed Grand Teleportation and quickly followed after them.</p>

  <p>This grand world lord's cultivation was much more stable than that of the young warriors so he could travel a distance ten times longer than they could. Before teleporting, he also managed to spread his perception within a thousand-mile range and pinpointed their location.</p>

  <p>Whoosh… Whoosh…</p>

  <p>They were on top of a blazing mountain about a hundred miles away!</p>

  <p>As soon as they landed, the grand world lord also appeared just a couple of feet away. Obviously, they failed to distance themselves from their pursuer, and worse, the Sacred grand world lord was now closer to them.</p>

  <p>Sizzle…</p>

  <p>This flaming mountain range was a field of fire all-year-round. The rocks were cracked and spewed out streaks of scorching flames.</p>

  <p>Nathan held his spear while Lucille's hands glowed from the five elements. It seemed that escape was no longer an option.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape so you want to fight it out?" The Sacred grand world lord laughed. Finally, their game of cat-and-mouse had come to an end and he could finally kill these two, pathetic rats. He had already killed 12 human world lords after he entered the Evolutionary Universe so these two shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite curious though. How could there be such stupid warriors like you? Did you get lost and stumble upon this place?" the grand world lord asked.</p>

  <p>He had already repeated this question thrice along the way but neither of the two answered him.</p>

  <p>The Fiery Rock World was the Humanity Alliance's hinterland so there was no need to station too many powerful warriors there. There also wasn't any Blood Curse Technique that was used to guard this place. If the human race wanted to take over this Fiery Rock World, they would have to attack the supreme worlds that lay at its borders. It was impossible for them to succeed as the boundaries were heavily guarded by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Just as the grand world lord was about to make his move…</p>

  <p>Maha's and Zheng's voices echoed throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>The grand world lord wore a puzzled expression as he listened.</p>

  <p>Even Nathan and Lucille had smug smiles on their faces as they listened to Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>"This guy… Does he have to make a scene when he just came back?"</p>

  <p>Lucille laughed, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, he has stolen the limelight all over again," Nathan grumbled.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Maha's conversation puzzled the grand world lord greatly. He then turned his gaze towards Lucille and Nathan and suddenly realized something.</p>

  <p>These two weren't running very fast, nor was there any sign of haste in their escape.</p>

  <p>There was even a time when the two of them simply ran back and forth around the edge of the Fiery Rock World. It seemed they didn't have any intention of getting rid of him.</p>

  <p>It was a bit strange but the grand world lord simply brushed it off back then. These two had only recently become world lords so he didn't really think they'd be that much of a threat to him. Since he was a bit bored, he indulged and chased them around a bit for some exercise.</p>

  <p>However, upon more careful consideration, it seemed they weren't really trying to escape. Instead, it seemed they had wanted to lure him away...</p>

  <p>For three days and three nights, these two had managed to shake off his subordinates. He was the only one that remained to chase after them.</p>

  <p>Did they honestly think that they could defeat him if they joined forces?</p>

  <p>That was ridiculous! They were mere world lords. He was sure to crush them under his foot!</p>

  <p>However, after Maha revealed Zheng's status as a Godly Genius, a thought suddenly crossed the grand world lord's mind.</p>

  <p>Why did these two warriors get lost? Because they didn't come here from the Thoughtless Minds. The two of them came from a place far beyond this universe!</p>

  <p>They came from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land!</p>

  <p>These two were Godly Geniuses!</p>

  <p>The puzzled expression on the grand world lord's face instantly cleared.</p>

  <p>Nathan noticed this and couldn't help but sneer. "It's time."</p>

  <p>"It has already begun," Lucille said with a charming smile.</p>

  <p>"Rumble!"</p>

  <p>A massive hand suddenly appeared beneath the grand world lord.</p>

  <p>This giant hand was made of rocks, courtesy of Lucille who could freely control any of the Original Laws.</p>

  <p>Before he could even react, the grand world lord found himself firmly caught by the giant hand.</p>

  <p>To say he was panicking was an understatement.</p>

  <p>He didn't know who these two Godly Geniuses were nor just how strong they could be, however, he knew Maha and he was the number one Godly Genius in the Murphy Universe. It seemed that the grand world lord might have bitten off more than he could chew. These Godly Geniuses' strength far surpassed that of ordinary warriors' at the same level which meant that dying in their hands was now a huge possibility.</p>

  <p>However, this huge hand made of rocks could only bind him and caused no substantial damage.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he really wanted to use the Grand Teleportation to escape this sudden predicament!</p>

  <p>However, this Grand Teleportation wasn't something that could be used instantly. It required a certain process.</p>

  <p>As a grand world lord, he would need a few seconds to activate it.</p>

  <p>"What a fool!" Lucille exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to activate the Grand Teleportation, the giant hand tightened around him and smashed him ruthlessly onto the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The impact put him in a daze. The Space Law he had just released formed a blazing white channel on the spot he was smashed into but it was already too late since he was already gone from that spot.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation failed!</p>

  <p>If he was a bit more relaxed and level-headed, the grand world lord could've broken free from the giant hand first and then used the Grand Teleportation. However, in his panic, he put the cart before the horse which led to his failure in teleporting.</p>

  <p>Now it would take him a minute before he could activate it once more.</p>

  <p>Nathan wasn't going to grant him that luxury.</p>

  <p>The young man grasped his spear and shot it towards the grand world lord while his eyes emitted a formidable cyan light.</p>

  <p>To Nathan the entire world had now turned into countless thin lines and dots.</p>

  <p>"Weak spot," Nathan murmured as he charged. He had already found the grand world lord's weak spot. He rolled his spear in his hand and aimed to kill with one shot.</p>

  <p>The grand world lord couldn't help but quake in the face of Nathan's Law Spear Strike. This was a life or death crisis!</p>

  <p>"Dream on! Beast spirits, devour!"</p>

  <p>"Roar... Roar... Roar..."</p>

  <p>Above his head, a scroll quickly unfurled. From it burst forth powerful vicious beasts that pounced towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>These beast spirits were incredibly ferocious, however, all Nathan could see were lines and dots.</p>

  <p>"They could not withstand even a single blow. So lame!"</p>

  <p>In Nathan's eyes, he could see all those beast spirits had weak points all over their bodies.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Truth Godly Way was extremely powerful, to begin with. Even a Supreme Lord would have no chance of surviving Nathan's spear, much less these beast spirits.</p>

  <p>Nathan thrust his spear into the air, shattering all the beast spirits.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it reached the grand world lord's neck.</p>

  <p>"Even if you kill me, you won't be able to leave this place! This is the core supreme world of our Sacred race!" he spat bitterly.</p>

  <p>Nathan smiled. "You don't have to worry about that!"</p>

  <p>The spear was gentle and left only a small bloody hole in the grand world lord's neck. A long, slender crack formed from that hole until his entire body was split apart like porcelain.</p>

  <p>Nathan lightly shook his spear to get rid of the blood. "We need to find a place to hide."</p>

  <p>"I wonder when they will come and save us," Lucille murmured with worry. The grand world lord was right, it would be incredibly difficult for them to leave this place.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Zheng has already revealed himself. My father will definitely figure out where we are through calculation and bring us back," Nathan said with confidence.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was unable to calculate anything within the Evolutionary Universe because they were unable to communicate with the heavens.</p>

  <p>There was no way the heavens of the Evolutionary Universe would help these invaders.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had caused such a commotion, everyone now knew that the Godly Geniuses had returned. Both the human race and Sacred race would try their best to find them, however, this was going to be a challenging task for the Sacred race. The Evolutionary Universe was too big and locating one Godly Genius would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>However, it would be really easy for the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe to find them through calculation.</p>

  <p>The only trouble was, would any Supreme Lord dare enter the Fiery Rock World to come to their rescue?</p>
