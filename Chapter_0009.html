<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 9 Crisis (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The next morning, to Luo Zheng's surprise, no guard appeared to dress and escort him to the Martial Arts Hall. Since the beating process was crucial to his refinement as a mysterious weapon, Luo Luo Zheng dressed and walked to the Hall.</p>

  <p>As he marched, Luo Luo Zheng thought over the disturbing behavior of his two uncles and their sons. They seemed to be defying the rules of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Especially Perrin and Andrew never cared about the family rules. Perhaps this was the reason why some servants in the Luo Clan had dared to become arrogant and haughty.</p>

  <p>However, even if others disregarded the rules set by the Luo Clan, it didn't mean Luo Luo Zheng would ignore the values he grew up with. It also did not mean that others should expect Luo Luo Zheng to look the other way if they openly flaunted the Luo Clan's rules. He was not pedantic, but Luo Luo Zheng did have morals and values that he respected.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng reached the Hall, he noticed that the atmosphere was somewhat different from usual.</p>

  <p>By now word had spread that Luo Luo Zheng had beaten Darren and Grey the previous day.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, Luo Luo Zheng had become a convicted person after false allegations were levied against him and his family. He then became a slave for the Luo Clan. Like other convicted slaves, he was made to work as a human punchbag in the Martial Arts Hall. He always stayed indifferent to violence.</p>

  <p>No matter how much the Luo children attacked and beat him, he endured, let go of his anger, and remained quiet, as if he were a docile sheep.</p>

  <p>People had forgotten that Luo Luo Zheng was the young master of the Luo Clan. They had also forgotten his strength. He was one of the youngest to reach the flesh refining level.</p>

  <p>After the previous day's incident, the children realized that Luo Luo Zheng would not always tolerate everything that came his way. The children could assault him without repercussion as they were members of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Other people who were not part of the Clan were not going to get away with treating Luo Luo Zheng however they chose.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Luo children now began looking at Luo Luo Zheng with respect.</p>

  <p>When the trainer, Corey, asked the Luo children to pick their punchbags, no one dared to select Luo Luo Zheng. This came as a surprise to Luo Luo Zheng. He knew how important this beating was to the refining process, and he had been looking forward to being beaten today.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>What he needed was to exercise and refine his body, but when the Luo children didn't select him as their punchbag, Luo Luo Zheng found himself in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>He could not ask the children to beat him. Being a punchbag was not a fun job, and it would seem very odd for a punchbag to invite a beating. He could not reveal why he needed to be beaten either.</p>

  <p>Once all the punchbags had been selected, Luo Luo Zheng found that he was the only one left in the corner of the Martial Arts Hall. Luo Luo Zheng was very unhappy indeed. The Luo children should not be so frightened!</p>

  <p>He walked toward Melvin Luo who was practicing with a stone man and said,"Melvin, what good is it to fight with a stone man? I'll help you practice."</p>

  <p>"Well..." Melvin said with a frown. After his last encounter with Luo Luo Zheng, and having heard about the beating Luo Luo Zheng gave to Grey and Darren, Melvin wasn't so sure that he wanted to get into a fight with the former young master.</p>

  <p>"I am a punchbag. It is my duty to help you practice! Don't worry, my leather is thick. It can protect me." Luo Luo Zheng patted his chest as he spoke.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Luo Luo Zheng said, Melvin felt embarrassed. What would people say about Melvin if he were to refuse beating a punchbag? The Luo children who practiced daily were supposed to be stronger, meaner, and more resilient than the punchbags who were battered and bruised daily.</p>

  <p>Would he look weak? Would the other children make fun of him? Could he risk angering Luo Luo Zheng and getting a beating similar to Darren and Grey?</p>

  <p>Regardless of what the others would say, Melvin still felt worried. He wasn't as strong as before. If he could get 100 marks because of his strength earlier, now he could only get 50 or 60 marks.</p>

  <p>Melvin shrugged as he accepted Luo Zheng's offer. He couldn't possibly look bad in front of the other children. Once the practice started, Luo Luo Zheng realized why Melvin had hesitated. The strength with which Melvin was hitting Luo Luo Zheng was insufficient to refine his body. The effect this beating had on his body was not the same as the last time when Melvin had beaten Luo Luo Zheng. This dissatisfied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"More Strength! Hit hard right here!</p>

  <p>Your fist is too slow. What are you worried about?</p>

  <p>Now that is much better, but it is still not as good as yesterday."</p>

  <p>Seeing a punchbag tutoring a Luo child was unusual indeed. It was also rare to see a punchbag asking to be beaten harder. A group of children in the Martial Arts Hall were astonished by what they were witnessing. Their mouths hung open as they watched the practice session between Luo Luo Zheng and Melvin. They could not guess what Luo Luo Zheng was thinking.</p>

  <p>However, Melvin didn't pay attention to the other children. At first, he was upset with what Luo Luo Zheng was saying. He felt as though Luo Luo Zheng was taunting him.</p>

  <p>However, when Melvin noticed that he was slowly becoming better, he put aside his anger and focused. His limbs felt more comfortable now, and his power seemed to have returned to normal level.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The power of Melvin's fist passed from Luo Zheng's chest to his inner flesh. Luo Luo Zheng fell to the floor and thrashed in agony until the warmth began flowing through his body. As this continued, Luo Luo Zheng felt the impurities in his bones being refined, like reeling silk from cocoons.</p>

  <p>Each punch purified his bones. With an increase in his bone strength, Luo Luo Zheng could feel that he was getting tougher.</p>

  <p>Melvin's punches were like a Magical Pill for Luo Zheng's body. The joy of this qualitative change could not be described with words. After each punch, Luo Luo Zheng remembered to feign being in agony. Pain showed on his face, but secretly, he rejoiced in the refinement that his body was undergoing. It took all of his will power to stop from shouting 'let your fists hit me more violently!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as the guards went to refill the copper pot. The copper pot was used to keep track of time. The pot had a small opening from which water would trickle out. It took an hour for the pot to get empty. Luo Luo Zheng had been eagerly counting how many times the guards had refilled it. Since the pot had been refilled three times, it meant that three hours had passed.</p>

  <p>The thought brought joy to Luo Luo Zheng as it meant that the Luo servants would be bringing food, both for the children and their punchbags. Usually, Luo Luo Zheng like all other punchbags was unhappy as the Luo children were served delicious delicacies, while the punchbags got cold water and hard bread.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Luo Luo Zheng was too hungry to care about the food. After three hours of refining and practicing, he was very starving. Since the refinement process used a lot of physical energy, he didn't care that the food was unpalatable. Luo Luo Zheng grabbed the bread and was about to stuff it into his mouth when he was interrupted.</p>

  <p>A porcelain basin full of exquisite and fragrant meat suddenly appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he looked up, Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to see that Melvin was standing before him. "Let's eat together," Melvin said as he handed his rice bowl to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Instead of refusing, Luo Luo Zheng smiled gratefully and grabbed a handful of meat.</p>

  <p>"You beat Grey. Young Master Andrew will get you into trouble for that,"</p>

  <p>Melvin whispered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gobbled his food. Since he was a punchbag, he didn't get good food. It had been a while since anyone offered him delicious meat. While chewing, Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He knew that Melvin was simply reminding him of what was going to happen.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the former young master of the Luo Clan, and so he knew these rules better than anyone else.</p>
