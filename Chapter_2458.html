  <p>
</p>

  <p>A ray of sword light, one thousand feet long, appeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been trying so hard in the Immortal Mansion's training tower.</p>

  <p>If the Divine Dao, which were over three hundred, weren't fused and drawn out from the inner world, then they could cause severe internal injury.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Cultivation Nature could be used to integrate them smoothly and make the "Ways-blending Energy" become very obedient.</p>

  <p>However, despite already being obedient, it was still difficult to tame.</p>

  <p>Controlling the Ways-blending Energy after being extracted from the inner world was still difficult because it was very thick.</p>

  <p>He tried using the Emotion Closing Divine Dao but it was still to no avail.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng managed to stumble upon the key to his problem soon.</p>

  <p>Back in the Divine Time Temple, Luo Zheng saw a huge figure send out a hundred-thousand strikes in just thirteen moves.</p>

  <p>Comprehending the mysteries of that amazing master was impossible to do in just a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>However, he remembered comparing notes with Tianming when they were still in the universe.</p>

  <p>It was through these battles that Luo Zheng comprehended a certain extent of the Beginning Swordsmanship, up to the preliminary level.</p>

  <p>He wasn't too sure if the Beginning Swordsmanship was the exact same technique practiced by the giant shadow in the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>Tianming's abilities were limited, after all. What he could concur was that the Beginning Swordsmanship was definitely related to it.</p>

  <p>So after fusing the momentum with the swordsmanship, Luo Zheng launched his strike once again.</p>

  <p>The power that burst out from him shook the entire training tower and startled Saul, Joy, and even Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Gu Bei had put a lot of effort into building the Immortal Mansion after all. It was so solid that even a consummate True God wouldn't destroy it.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the sword light extended, it transformed into a large, new moon and slashed away at the consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The sword light disturbed and cut the flow of the air.</p>

  <p>It was so fast that Luo Zheng did not even have any time to react.</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the guy with soybean-like eyes only saw Luo Zheng waving the sword.</p>

  <p>In just a flash, a long, narrow cut appeared on his opponent's body. It started from his shoulder down to his torso, avoiding Yan entirely.</p>

  <p>It was only then that they felt the wind on their faces, caused by the sword light.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the soybean-eyed guy avoided this.</p>

  <p>"This... This strike is much more powerful than the previous one. It feels like my face is being skinned off by a sharp knife..." the soybean-eyed guy murmured, summoning a light barrier as protection.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, on the other hand, merely stood still with his eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>He just found it incredible how Luo Zheng's first attack diffused the consummate True God's thunderbolt awl.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the anonymous man who had powerful strength, that much had been established. However, it was still inconceivable for them to witness him resisting a consummate True God's attack.</p>

  <p>As for the second sword strike...</p>

  <p>Swords were the Sword Clan's honor.</p>

  <p>It was through swords that made the Sword Clan stronger. Through swords, they were able to occupy the Sunrest Tree and became the second greatest clan in the entirety of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Swords were the Sword Clan's foundation.</p>

  <p>They were considered as the authority in terms of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>A Divine Dao belonging to swordsmanship did not exist but the Sword Clan was able to go around this and merge all Divine Dao with their techniques.</p>

  <p>Using the Elementary Fire Divine Dao, they were able to create a token beyond it? the Flame Dancing Sword.</p>

  <p>Through the Thunderstorm Divine Dao, they were able to create the Thunderbolt Sword.</p>

  <p>Through their understanding of the Parting Water Divine Dao, they also created the Raging Inquiry Sword.</p>

  <p>And so on...</p>

  <p>A sword tablet existed in the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>Each time a Sword Clan master created a new, powerful token, a sword would appear on the sword tablet.</p>

  <p>The swords represented powerful and astonishing theurgies.</p>

  <p>During the course of the divine eras, sixty-three swords were inserted into the sword tablet.</p>

  <p>Reinhard often gazed at this tablet at sunset, admiring this representation of the Sword Clan's painstaking efforts over the years.</p>

  <p>He often thought that his clan had gone far and beyond in the way of swordsmanship and that there was no way the other clans could ever catch up.</p>

  <p>If the time ever came for when he finally became a consummate True God, Reinhard would make it his goal to insert his own sword into the tablet.</p>

  <p>One more sword was equivalent to advancing further in the way of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Such an achievement was considered the greatest honor for a Sword Clan member.</p>

  <p>However, Reinhard's conviction was inevitably shaken after he witnessed Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the strike Luo Zheng performed just now had the same power as Reinhard's Instant Sword.</p>

  <p>His technique relied on agility. Each move of the Instant Sword required exerting the most powerful force behind each slash but the key was in its speedy delivery.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's pursuit of the sword was different. Instead of speed, it was simplicity.</p>

  <p>When two different pursuits reached a certain level, they eventually converged and shared the same goal.</p>

  <p>The extremely simple method also brought with it unparalleled speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, a low-rank True God, performed a strike that made Reinhard feel as if his whole life had been meaningless.</p>

  <p>The young man wasn't his enemy but Reinhard still felt gutted by his display of superior skill.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was someone who climbed the mountain of swordsmanship with enthusiasm but the sudden discovery of someone that was of a higher, seemingly unreachable level dealt a great blow to his pride.</p>

  <p>"Luo Xiao's son is so strong and powerful," he couldn't help but exclaim.</p>

  <p>When the Luo Clan was destroyed, Reinhard merely turned up his nose condescendingly at them.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed the dispute between the Luo Clan and the Dongfang Clan wasn't as unreasonable as he first thought. It might have very well involved powers far above the rich and powerful clans.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>Atlas' body had been cut in half.</p>

  <p>An ordinary blade couldn't have injured his thunderbolt body at all.</p>

  <p>Facing against several consummate True Gods was something he could easily handle with ease.</p>

  <p>He even considered himself as an indestructible existence sometimes, much like a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until he was in his most desperate moment that he realized his vulnerability. In the end, he was eroded to death by the air of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>He had been reborn for no reason.</p>

  <p>He had initially wanted to grasp this opportunity of having been reborn.</p>

  <p>However, he never expected that he would be ended like this by a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"Has everything changed?" he murmured in confusion.</p>

  <p>Half of his body fell down with Yan.</p>

  <p>The other half turned once again into a complete human body although the light of the thunderbolt was noticeably dimmer.</p>

  <p>Dying always made people cherish their life even more. After realizing that his life was threatened, Atlas knew that fighting was futile and opted to run away instead.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud noise as he turned himself into a bolt of lightning and fled at a much faster rate than when he came.</p>

  <p>    </p>
