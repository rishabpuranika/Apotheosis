<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2384 A Small Misunderstanding </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After Zheng and Joy left for a period of time, ripples appeared at the edge of the lake from the colorful circle of light.</p>

  <p>As the ripples spread, Troy jumped out and landed steadily next to the lake.</p>

  <p>He immediately looked around and a glimmer of surprise appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Soon, Shahn, Walton, Rachelle, Alfredo, and the other consummate True Gods stepped out of the circle of light one after the other.</p>

  <p>"This is not the Time Sea!" Walton observed, looking at the great lake.</p>

  <p>Shahn glanced at Walton. "Isn't this nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"That guy must have escaped from the Time Sea," Troy said with a frown. "But with the amount of strength he has, it's impossible for him to escape from the Time Sea all by himself..." Troy took a few steps toward the striking black lake as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Then, he reached his iron hand out to the surface of the lake and tapped it.</p>

  <p>His iron hand, which had been shining with silver light all along, instantly turned black. A resolute expression appeared in Troy's eyes as he said, "Our Holy Emperor has taken action, and even wounded a Holy Being with his Destructive Poisonous Hand. I don't know who the Holy Being was, but it should have been the one who helped that guy escape."</p>

  <p>"You mean that Holy Nicholas has made a move?" Shahn's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Troy nodded. "Yes. But although I can't figure out who that Holy Being is, I know that this Holy Being has been heavily injured."</p>

  <p>"We'll know everything as soon as we get back. But first, we'll have to find out exactly where we are in the divine land," Shahn said.</p>

  <p>The divine land was too vast. Holy Beings could travel through the place at will, but the distance that a consummate True God could teleport was limited in comparison.</p>

  <p>"Why do you keep silent?" Walton looked at Rachelle curiously.</p>

  <p>During these three days, she had been unusually silent and depressed.</p>

  <p>Swish! Shahn spread his fan open and said, "A mere low-rank True God managed to control the jade seal, but it was only with luck and arrogance. I hope you won't let your state of mind be affected by this."</p>

  <p>Everyone who had become consummate True Gods in the divine land had only managed to do so after having their state of mind thoroughly tempered. How could they take a little humiliation to heart?</p>

  <p>"No, it's not that..."</p>

  <p>Rachelle looked up at the sky and gazed at the clouds that were slowly floating in the air. "Before I entered the jade seal, I had a hunch that if I missed that opportunity, I would never be able to kill him... I'm afraid there will be no such chance in the future."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Shahn and Walton burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? That'll only happen if he keeps hiding somewhere in the divine land. The moment he shows up, he will definitely die,"</p>

  <p>Walton said.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle heard this, blood-red internal momentum slowly emitted from her eyes. "Yes, if I meet him again, I will definitely kill him." As the internal momentum of the Murdering Godly Way circulated in her body, a strong killing intent also spread out...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the gate of the fairy palace, Joy took a glance at the surroundings before following Zheng inside.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, Zheng had brought Yudie and his family members to the fairy palace before returning to the universe. After spending a short period of time in the universe, he had sneaked into the divine land. Two years had passed since he had traveled from the ancestral land of the Han Clan to the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>He had sent his family to the fairy palace for two reasons: one, for their safety; and two, the fairy palace was located in the Swirl Forest, where time passed at the same rate as it did in the divine land.</p>

  <p>If he had let them continue staying in the Evolutionary Universe, they would have aged considerably before he went back to see them. Two years in the divine land was equivalent to decades in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>In the side hall of the fairy palace...</p>

  <p>Six tapestries featuring golden Sanskrit words were hanging on the wall.</p>

  <p>At the center of the side hall, a handsome young man in white was holding a brush in his hand. He was writing on the white paper spread on the ground.</p>

  <p>As he wrote, he trembled with sweat dripping down from his face. His white clothes were already drenched with sweat.</p>

  <p>"Seal!"</p>

  <p>When he shouted, an extremely special power entered him and touched his spirit, causing him to roar out through his gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>After shouting the word, he bent over and quickly wrote the word "seal" on the paper.</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of words written on the paper, which was spread behind him for a distance of about a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>After writing the word "seal," the young man looked even more dispirited, but he still gritted his teeth and prepared to yell out the next word.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey! Geoffrey! That's enough for today!"</p>

  <p>Outside the side hall, Yudie continuously knocked on the door.</p>

  <p>All of the people present were concerned about the young man, including Freya, Aura, and Imogen.</p>

  <p>However, the Immortal Book in the library stroked his beard and said calmly, "It's just consuming a lot of his energy. The worst thing that could happen is him passing out. But he will benefit a lot from reading out all these words! So just let him be. Even I don't know how much he'll be able to achieve!"</p>

  <p>"What if his soul gets hurt?" Yudie said angrily.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book laughed. "The Soul Healing Pills in the pill refining room are not for display, you know."</p>

  <p>"Open the door for me now!"</p>

  <p>Yudie was very worried about her son, so she was very angry. She rushed forward and tried to close the Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>Although Yudie was at the Soul Sea Realm, she was still nothing in the eyes of Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>The old man's figure flashed and reappeared far away. There was no way that Yudie could catch him.</p>

  <p>"Saul!"</p>

  <p>Yudie turned to Saul, who was standing next to her.</p>

  <p>Saul's expression was calm. With a slight smile, he said, "The young master said that no one should enter without his permission."</p>

  <p>"You!" Yudie's expression suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only master of this fairy palace. Why was there a young master?</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Saul was saying that just because he and the Immortal Book wanted Geoffrey to grasp the meaning of the Sanskrit words. They were going too far!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a happy smile appeared on Saul's face. "The master is back!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Yudie was stunned.</p>

  <p>The faces of Aura and Freya, who were standing beside them, also lit up in happiness.</p>

  <p>Imogen, on the other hand, snorted coldly. "He has been gone for so many years that I was starting to wonder if he would ever want to come back!"</p>

  <p>Despite saying that, she followed the rest of them to the gate of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>When Yudie saw Zheng slowly walking over from the center of the square, her eyes were filled with joy.</p>

  <p>But just as she was about to rush over to him, she saw a woman standing behind Zheng. Her face froze.</p>

  <p>The woman behind Zheng was tall, graceful, and charming. She was a beautiful woman. More importantly, she exuded an extremely strong aura, which, though plain, instilled a strong sense of fear in anyone who met her.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Yudie to figure out the woman's cultivation level, but she faintly felt that this woman was probably the strongest person she had ever seen.</p>

  <p>What annoyed Yudie the most was that the aura she sensed from this woman was somewhat like Margaret's!</p>

  <p>When Imogen noticed Yudie's expression, she heavily knocked her walking stick onto the ground and gave a cold snort while pulling a long face.</p>

  <p>If it were not the fact that she had sensed the unfathomable cultivation level of the woman, she would have asked, "How dare you bring back a bitch?" right to Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>When Zheng noticed the change in Yudie's expression, he became embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was impossible for Joy to not notice their reactions, but she continued standing near Zheng with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>With her status and temperament, there was no way she would explain anything.</p>

  <p>"Tia, this is a friend of my father," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Although Joy had never explicitly stated the kind of relationship with Zheng's father, Mike, Zheng had been able to read between the lines.</p>

  <p>However, since she was a Demi-holy Being, it was impossible for him to address her with any inappropriate titles.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, all the women were slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>Although their cultivation levels lagged far behind Zheng's, their horizons had broadened during the time they had spent with Zheng. They had a certain understanding of the structure and hierarchy of the divine land and the origins of the universes.</p>

  <p>Zheng's father was the creator of the universe, a Holy Being of the divine land. So, they wondered if this woman was also a Holy Being.</p>
