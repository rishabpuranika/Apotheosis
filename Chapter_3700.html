<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others regarded Ziya as a junior.</p>

  <p>The ancient human civilization had miserably ended because they failed to complete the Finale Way. It was so tragic that even when the human ancestor sacrificed himself, it still didn't stop the disaster.</p>

  <p>At that time, Ziya had a great reputation among the human race, but he wasn't the central figure in the battle of the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>In other words, no one in the chaos had noticed him.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that he would be banished to the Land of Ashes, also known as the Deleting Space?</p>

  <p>Then, over a thousand chaotic eras had passed, and he met his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, again. Of course, he was quite excited.</p>

  <p>"Ziya..."</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that a being like the Primeval Lord of Heaven had seen through the vanity of life. He, however, was enthusiastic to see his beloved disciple.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect King Manard to be the disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "How did you get exiled to the Land of Ashes?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>Ziya was lost in thought. It was a long time ago, so he found it hard to recall the details of the past. After a while, he began to tell the Primeval Lord of Heaven about how he got exiled and what had happened in this space.</p>

  <p>Zheng listened quietly and he found that he had heard about some of those things before, but this time, Ziya had everything spelled out.</p>

  <p>Although Ziya was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's disciple, he wasn't weak compared to the Eternal Warriors such as the Snake Goddess and Houyi. In fact, he had led many powerful warriors to step into the Eternal Realm and become the Eternal Warriors during the 77th chaos.</p>

  <p>Among the twelve disciples of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Ziya was the most important.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a long sigh after Ziya had explained what happened in the past, including the events in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>"Back then, we had absorbed the quintessence of the elders and made ten plans, but in the end, we failed. Since then, the Element Spirit race has suppressed us. I didn't expect that you still got a chance to find such a place," he said.</p>

  <p>When Ziya saw his master sigh, he was confused. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared at him and said, "We have fought against the Element Spirit race on the Other Shore for an exit for a long time. We still haven't attained that exit, and now, it's still in their hands.</p>

  <p>That is one of the reasons we are trapped in Stage Thirty-three."</p>

  <p>"Exit? Master, do you mean there is an exit in Stage Thirty-three?" Ziya asked again.</p>

  <p>He was also an Eternal Warrior and had been to Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>However, the human race's understanding of the Other Shore was far from thorough as it was now when he had been in Stage Thirty-three. Therefore, he didn't know that there was an exit there.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with piqued interest. "Over the years, I've had many speculations about the outside of the chaos, but I can't prove them if I don't go there in person.</p>

  <p>Ziya, please take me there so I can have a look," he asked. "Sure!" Ziya readily agreed.</p>

  <p>He got up, but he seemed to have remembered something. He turned to Zheng and said, "Please come with me. I want to help my master and the elders forge their bodies!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand as he spoke, and instantly transported both of them to another place.</p>

  <p>Since he could control the time and space in the Deleting Space, he was the one who had the final say.</p>

  <p>They walked through some winding paths for a while, and then Zheng saw a small mountain that was several hundred feet high in front of him. This mountain seemed to be a part of the ruins.</p>

  <p>Its surface was wet and sticky like watery soil. "King... What's this, Master Ziya?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Ziya smiled and said, "This is the Nirvana Clay."</p>

  <p>Zheng simply blinked as he didn't know what the Nirvana Clay was.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked at it curiously. "As far as I know, there shouldn't be such a thing in the Source World, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and the others believed that everything in the Deleting Space was deleted from the Source World. However, the Nirvana Clay was a kind of Other Shore Token that could help the Other Shore creatures rebuild their bodies. Thus, it shouldn't be in this place.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't come from the Source World or the Other Shore. I brought it back from the Abstruse Energy World," Ziya said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You can bring things back from the Abstruse Energy World?" the Snake Goddess asked in shock. As for the Primeval Lord of Heaven, he knew that there was another world outside the chaos, but he had never seen that world.</p>

  <p>But since Ziya had named that world the Abstruse Energy World, then they also used that name.</p>

  <p>"I was lucky. I can forge your bodies with the Nirvana Clay, but the new bodies can only live in the Deleting Space," Ziya stated.</p>

  <p>After he spoke, he stretched out his hand towards the small mountain of Nirvana Clay and gently scratched it. Soft clay fell off the mountain wall, turned into human shapes and slowly walked down the slope.</p>

  <p>As the human-shaped clay walked down, their faces, hair, and features slowly formed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Ziya activated the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to make clothes for them.</p>

  <p>Because the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were in Zheng's body, their energy souls had appeared as the Other Shore Tokens. Thus, their energy souls could leave as long as Zheng allowed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The energy souls all drilled into the bodies made of the Nirvana Clay.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Ziya was ecstatic when he saw the former masters, elders, and powerhouses have reappeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was just like he had returned to the 77th chaos, the world of starry regions humans had dominated.</p>

  <p>Once the heroes had adapted to their new bodies, he led them to the cave.</p>

  <p>It was hard to dig this cave, and the cave itself was quite small, so everyone entered one by one.</p>

  <p>Ziya, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess walked in the front. Zheng had been in there once, so he was the last one to enter.</p>

  <p>While Zheng waited for his turn, he heard the Regal Jade Spirit's voice from his inner world that said, "Zheng, Geoffrey wants to see the Abstruse Energy World. Can you let him go there to have a look?"</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey?" he asked in disbelief. Needless to say, he was stunned.</p>

  <p>After he entrusted Geoffrey to the Regal Jade Spirit, he didn't care much about him anymore.</p>

  <p>Now that the Oneness Sky Palace was under attack and in chaos, he didn't plan to release Geoffrey from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Still, it was a good choice to settle him in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, Ziya had mentioned that anyone who had a powerful ability to decipher Sanskrit words would adapt much easier to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey could decipher almost all Sanskrit words in a second, so Zheng wondered if he could quickly adapt to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Tell him that I'll let him out after the human elders return," Zheng told the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>
