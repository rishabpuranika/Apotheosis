  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's acting was vivid, and he was even able to guess what that man was going to say. Needless to say, the warrior was stunned.</p>

  <p>He said in a daze, "How did you know what I? "</p>

  <p>"How did you know what I was going to say?" Luo Luo Zheng continued, "It's simple? it's very easy to guess what an idiot is about to say!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Even Yolande, the leader of the Mist Palace, couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>The man with an aquiline nose was resentful. His eyes were cold and sharp as he glared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the two talents from the Upper World were also glaring at Luo Luo Zheng as they wanted to beat him up.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng learned this from the old man from the Celestial Position race. He always accurately predicted what others were going to say. It could be upsetting at times.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew how to observe people so he knew that the man with an aquiline nose didn't have a good relationship with Yolande. Since they weren't on the same side, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't mind offending him. He was always a straightforward man.</p>

  <p>The man with an aquiline nose had enrolled two good disciples, wanting to show off in front of Yolande. It had gone smoothly at first. Warriors whose Lotus Flower had sprouted seven petals were rare in the universe.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he'd be proud but Luo Luo Zheng ruined his good mood.</p>

  <p>"Kid, warriors don't use their mouths to fight," the man said as he coldly stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother teaching me anything. I have my own master. I don't need you to teach me," Luo Luo Zheng replied. Most warriors would be very nervous when facing a warrior who was as powerful as a world lord. Some would even get aggressive but Luo Luo Zheng was noticeably calm.</p>

  <p>If he became too nervous, he'd make Yolande lose face. If he was too aggressive, he might get her in trouble. Luo Luo Zheng had just told off the two disciples, not the man with an aquiline nose. The two disciples were of the same generation as he was, so it wouldn't cause him much trouble.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to be as neutral as possible when talking to the man with an aquiline nose.</p>

  <p>"Master?" The man chuckled. "I wonder what cultivation level a mere warrior from the Lower World is at."</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared on Yolande's face. 'Does Luo Luo Zheng have a master?' As far as she knew, Luo Luo Zheng was pretty independent on his path of cultivation which meant he didn't have a master.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng said with a straight face, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You don't even know your master's cultivation level? That's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng added, "But he's someone that is widely respected and revered throughout the universe." A faint smile once again appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, both the man and Yolande looked shocked. 'Someone who is widely respected and revered throughout the universe? Is he just showing off? He's being too arrogant!' the man thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then said, "Of course, that's just my opinion!"</p>

  <p>The man with an aquiline nose had lost face in front of Luo Luo Zheng. He found himself constantly responding to anything that came out of Luo Zheng's mouth.</p>

  <p>This wasn't like him at all. He was as powerful as a world lord? he should always be calm and composed in front of a mere warrior like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't help it. He was stunned and he couldn't hide it no matter how embarrassing it was.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that he was in the Mist Palace, he would have killed Luo Luo Zheng already!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't even being disrespectful. Even if he did want to reprimand Luo Luo Zheng, he wouldn't know what to say either. Ultimately, he could only grind his teeth and bark, "Let's go! To the Weapon House!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone else didn't want to stay there a second longer than they needed to, so in the blink of an eye, they were gone too.</p>

  <p>As for Yolande, she was beaming with joy as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng and said,</p>

  <p>"I've really underestimated you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed softly, "I didn't want to, but I've encountered too many people like him. I'm used to it."</p>

  <p>He had encountered so many people who always tried to make everything unnecessarily difficult for him. If he could, he'd teach that warrior a lesson or two. But he couldn't, so the only thing he could do was tell them off.</p>

  <p>Yolande was in a much better mood now. As she walked, she told Luo Luo Zheng that the man with an aquiline nose was Timothy Xu, a vice leader of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>He had a great background and his father was a Supreme Lord. When he entered the Mist Palace, he competed with Yolande to be the leader.</p>

  <p>Since then, they had always been at each other's throats.</p>

  <p>This time, he intended to taunt Yolande, but Luo Luo Zheng had angered him so much that he left. Naturally, this pleased Yolande.</p>

  <p>After climbing the stairs, Yolande extended her hand towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hand it over!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to help Xun recover her soul or not?" Yolande asked.</p>

  <p>"Right now?" Luo Luo Zheng was astonished.</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head and said, "Xun was once almost a world lord. It's impossible to completely repair her soul in a short period of time, but I have a way to wake her up and restore a large portion of her soul."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yolande say this, Luo Luo Zheng happily took out the Soul Nurturing Wood from his space ring. He checked Xun's status in the Soul Nurturing Wood, and a warm feeling was transmitted from it. Xun had been sleeping for a long time, and now she could finally wake up.</p>

  <p>He wondered how she would react if she found out she was in a supreme world.</p>

  <p>After passing the Soul Nurturing Wood to Yolande, he received a jade slip and a small jade pendant from her. "Within this jade slip is the map of the Mist Palace. Whoever enters our thirteen palaces will have the chance to choose a weapon from the Weapon House for free. Whatever weapon you choose is up to you."</p>

  <p>Weapon?</p>

  <p>"What rank are the weapons? Are there any divine weapons?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "What do you think the thirteen palaces are? Do you really think we won't have divine weapons here?" Yolande shook her head. She could tell that Luo Luo Zheng didn't understand how abound in resources the thirteen palaces were.</p>

  <p>The top talents of the 3, 000 supreme worlds were gathered here. It would be laughable if the weapons in the Weapon House weren't even divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. In his last battle with Fenton, his sacred weapon had been broken. Of course, the Illusion Space was just a projection. Naturally, his top-grade sacred weapon wasn't actually broken, but it meant that Luo Luo Zheng didn't actually have a proper weapon.</p>

  <p>Since he already had the opportunity to choose a weapon, he wouldn't miss the chance.</p>

  <p>As Yolande was helping Xun recover her soul, Luo Luo Zheng followed the map in the jade slip to the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spiritual Force House of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place had gathered all the top talents of the tenth-grade sacred place. The Mist Palace, as one of the thirteen palaces, was a place where talents from different sacred places gathered.</p>

  <p>Any one of them was good enough to become a core member of a tenth-grade sacred place. Even the Spiritual Force Sacred Place would have to try pretty hard to get Fenton into the thirteen palaces. They hoped that he could have better resources and opportunities there.</p>

  <p>After traveling through the huge Mist Palace for a long time, Luo Luo Zheng finally found the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the Weapon House, there were also two guards. These guards were much stronger than the ones on the stairs. They were warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>At that time, the guards were being surrounded by warriors.</p>

  <p>These warriors were all very young, roughly the same age as Luo Luo Zheng. The older ones were only around 30 years old. They were all gathered together, pointing towards the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>"Today, the Weapon House has some new secondary first-rank divine weapons."</p>

  <p>"So what? Sounds like we can't get one of them."</p>

  <p>"I want to try my luck!"</p>

  <p>"Bah! It costs 300 life vitality jades to try once. If you can afford, then go on and try it!"</p>

  <p>These warriors should also be talents that had been sent into the thirteen palaces by their respective supreme worlds. Needless to say, Luo Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>One had to pay 300 life vitality jades to choose a weapon from the Weapon House?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had more than 100 life vitality jades in his hands. However, this was far from enough. He'd never heard of a place that required so many life vitality jades. So Luo Luo Zheng, who had originally been planning to enter the House, stopped in his tracks.</p>
