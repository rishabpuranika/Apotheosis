<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After hearing Master Evil's introduction, Zheng's thoughts floated back to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>He thought about Han Liusu and Aleyna.</p>

  <p>At the time, the two sisters were a big headache to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Since Han Clan's Holy Emperor is a Holy Being, what's his relationship with Murphy?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With wide eyes, Master Evil shook his head. "I don't know about that."</p>

  <p>His influence only reached within the Vast Sky Region. Even within the region, he wasn't a peak existence� he had never even been to those Floating Islands, so how could he have known about the relationships between the top level characters in the divine land?</p>

  <p>"But... It doesn't matter, does it?" Master Evil asked helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I've been to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and have met some of the Han Clan's members. If I were to rush in, I'm afraid they would recognize me," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng needed to pay attention to wasn't only the two sisters of the Han Clan, but also the personal guards of the two girls, including Kennan. If the Han Clan had a good relationship with the Mu Clan and if Luo Zheng was recognized, such things would get troublesome.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng knew that since there were hundreds of thousands of proving godly warriors, it was unlikely that the Han Clan would take notice of Luo Zheng, he understood that everything had to be done with caution.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Luo Zheng had no way out.</p>

  <p>"It's no problem if you don't want to go to the Six-Burden Region," said Master Evil, "but the thirty-six smaller regions around it are all under Han Clan's control, so merely leaving this small region isn't an easy task for you."</p>

  <p>The wealthy clans of the Floating Islands all had their own areas within the divine land, and the Vast Sky Region was also a part of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng was unable to use Grand Teleportation, and his Teleportation Token was rendered useless. What was worse, he couldn't even fly. All he could do was use Han Clan's long-distance teleportation channels, but teleportation was quite expensive even for a True God, even more so for the current Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the hundreds of divine might coins Luo Zheng got from Master Evil weren't enough to send Luo Zheng out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng fell into deep thought� it was just as Master Evil had said, divine might coins were too important, but Luo Zheng did not have the ability to earn divine might coins himself yet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng remembered that he had the Soul Searching Flag that Marko, Murphy's disciple, left behind. He had brought it into the divine land. "I have some treasure� Marko's Soul Searching Flag. Is it worth any divine might coins?"</p>

  <p>But Master Evil rejected the suggestion. "The Soul Searching Flag?</p>

  <p>Haha! That's valuable indeed. It was Murphy's treasure. Even though he's given up on using it, it's still very famous. If you use it, you might be discovered soon. That will be even more dangerous."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stuck in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, you're only really afraid that the Han Clan will recognize you. Though they have so many disciples, only a few of them have seen you in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, so the probability of you being recognized is pretty low. I can teach you a skill that can change your appearance� I'm sure even your father will not be able to recognize you in person." Master Evil laughed again.</p>

  <p>Clearly, that was a bit of an exaggeration. For some powerful warriors, once they locked onto the opponent's Mu Ning, they could recognize him even if his body was burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>But in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the ones with the highest cultivation level were merely world lords, and they didn't have such means. Luo Zheng was happy to accept Master Evil's offer.</p>

  <p>While Master Evil advised Luo Zheng in his mind, the latter walked west along the main road of the Mirror City.</p>

  <p>After walking a short distance, a golden light flashed across Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Just then, Master Evil said, "Someone is following you."</p>

  <p>"I know. It's a True God," Luo Zheng replied calmly in his mind.</p>

  <p>A thousand feet behind him, a middle-aged man clad in a gray robe followed Luo Zheng at a steady pace.</p>

  <p>Because he had just arrived at the divine land, it was impossible for Murphy to find him so early. This person was clearly following him because the guardians of the Mirror City had reported something to their leaders.</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't matter. A mere low-rank True God wouldn't dare openly attack people in Mirror City," Master Evil sneered.</p>

  <p>The entire divine land followed a strict hierarchy� even Holy Beings were governed by the rules of the stone slab.</p>

  <p>The central divine cities and the other divine cities of various regions also had their own rules.</p>

  <p>No matter how much someone fought outside of the divine cities and killed people for their goods, normally, no one would even care about it.</p>

  <p>But the rules within the divine cities were extremely strict.</p>

  <p>Back then, Master Evil occupied almost a third of the northern part of the Vast Sky Region, so the Han Clan was naturally aware of it. But they did not send anyone to deal with him. Even Master Evil was also very familiar with these rules� every time he entered Mirror City, he would make sure to behave himself and avoid causing any trouble.</p>

  <p>On the west side of Mirror City was a giant square with a grayish-brown stone wall erected on it. The stone wall seemed out of place among the surrounding buildings of Mirror City. On the stone wall stood several gates ten feet wide.</p>

  <p>These were the Mirror City's teleportation channels.</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be anyone using these teleportation channels."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said curiously.</p>

  <p>The total of nine gates on the stone wall indicated that there were nine teleportation channels. But the entire square was empty save for a few black armored guards standing in front of the stone wall, all wearing bored expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>Master Evil smiled faintly. "Nonsense. It's not easy to construct a teleportation channel in the divine land and teleporting is extremely expensive as well. It would cost at least a hundred divine might coins to teleport from the Vast Sky Region to the Six-Burden Region. It would be difficult even for ordinary low-rank True Gods to afford it."</p>

  <p>"Then if a True God wants to go to the Six-Burden Region, what should they do?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not like the different regions are truly separated from each other.</p>

  <p>They can just go on foot. It might take three or four hundred years, though," Master Evil laughed.</p>

  <p>His response left Luo Zheng stunned.</p>

  <p>Such a thing wasn't uncommon in the universe. For instance, it wasn't easy for someone of the Soul Sea Realm to cross a supreme world. If Luo Zheng didn't have a Teleportation Token, it would have been very difficult for him to travel between supreme worlds. But he didn't expect that after becoming a True God, one would have to face such a seemingly mundane problem.</p>

  <p>The universe's space channels were extremely cheap but a single teleportation in the divine land could actually consume all the wealth of a True God.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng finally understood the importance of the divine might coins. If it weren't for the few hundred divine might coins Master Evil gave him, he wouldn't even be able to enter Mirror City, let alone use the teleportation channels.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man following Luo Zheng frowned when he saw Luo Zheng walk towards the square.</p>

  <p>He had just received news from his nephew who happened to be a Mirror City guard� an extremely powerful proving godly warrior with a powerful soul had just entered the city. Although this person was only a proving godly warrior, he seemed to be rather wealthy.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng didn't reveal his wealth, a proving godly warrior who could casually take out a divine might coin to enter the city was considered a rarity. So the True God targeted Luo Zheng immediately, planning to rob him after leaving the city.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man understood that it was highly likely that Luo Zheng had come from a powerful force, but as the saying went, 'Men die in pursuit of wealth and birds die in pursuit of food, ' he didn't let himself overthink it.</p>

  <p>But never did he expect Luo Zheng to head straight for the teleportation channels.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was also a native True God of the Vast Sky Region. He had fought for three divine eras in Mirror City before finally taking root and buying a house there. But in total, it was only worth 80 divine might coins, making up his entire wealth.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that Luo Zheng might be able to easily take out a hundred divine might coins to use the teleportation channel. This brat was only a proving godly warrior!</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man suddenly felt an ache in his heart� it would be good if he had intercepted Luo Zheng before he entered the city.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was about to leave through the teleportation channel, the middle-aged man gritted his teeth and quickly stepped in front of Luo Zheng. In a low voice, he said, "Friend, why have you come to our Mirror City?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had discovered the person long ago and there wasn't the slightest trace of panic on his face. Although this was his first time entering the divine land, he knew humans' hearts and minds were about the same.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot a glance at the middle-aged man. "Is this Mirror City yours?"</p>

  <p>His question put an awkward expression on the middle-aged man's face.</p>

  <p>After concealing his embarrassment, he said, "The divine city does not belong to one person."</p>

  <p>"Then to whom does this city belong?" Luo Zheng asked once again.</p>

  <p>"Mirror City belongs to the Qian Clan of the Vast Sky Region. Strictly speaking, the Qian Clan is controlled by the Han Clan, making Mirror City belong to the latter." In all seriousness, the man explained.</p>

  <p>"I see, thank you. Goodbye, now." Luo Zheng laughed and turned to leave.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the man was stunned silent before he realized that he had been tricked. He was there to rob the brat, not to talk about the city, and his expression turned dark. "Although I do not know where you came from, if you want to leave Mirror City safely, I'm afraid you will need to leave something behind."</p>
