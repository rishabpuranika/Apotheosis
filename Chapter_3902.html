<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey took a good, long look at the thread but still couldn't figure out its use.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to reach for it in an attempt to pull it closer, a scene flashed in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw a golden beach, picturesque and beautiful, with the cold seawater that constantly surged at the edges.</p>

  <p>His pupils contracted as he took in the sight. "Is this the Sea of Truth?" he muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He traced the length of the thread and discovered that it was connected to a grain of sand on the beach.</p>

  <p>He found himself filled with awe and confusion. "Could it be that such a long thread connects to a single grain of sand?"</p>

  <p>He then remembered Ziya told him that the energy of all Other Shore Tokens came from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked him how exactly the energy was transmitted, but Ziya couldn't answer. After all, it wasn't a subject Ziya dabbled in.</p>

  <p>The concept of space in the Abstruse Energy World was completely different from that of the chaos. Now Geoffrey perceived this thread was very long, but in fact, it might not be necessarily true.</p>

  <p>"A grain of sand connects to a thread. If that is the case, then..."</p>

  <p>As he was thinking, he took a step forward and onto the second stair. He was now on the second page and suddenly, dozens of threads appeared.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey reached out for the threads and saw every single scene at the end of each one.</p>

  <p>"Sand, sand, sand, and sand..."</p>

  <p>It was as he had predicted. Each thread connected to a grain of sand on that golden beach. The threads grew in number but the scene stayed almost exactly the same.</p>

  <p>Upon the realization that the pages at the bottom might just contain endless sand, Geoffrey decided to draw Ziya and climb up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The spiral staircase formed out of the pages. The further he went, the greater the number of threads that appeared was.</p>

  <p>Each time he passed by a page, Geoffrey would reach out just to check and found each page was full of sand.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought that maybe there was nothing else to see, he finally came upon a new discovery. He had arrived on the tenth page and found that the thread connected to a grain of sand, much like the others, except this particular grain was fused with a creature that had just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>This grain of sand was not on the beach but in a round inner world!</p>

  <p>The sand was the lowest-level Other Shore Token and contained less than one divine megaton of power. Only a fool would choose to fuse themselves with the sand, yet Geoffrey was encountering such a fool.</p>

  <p>He was practically speechless and spent quite a while just staring. After his shock receded, Geoffrey decided to continue his ascent.</p>

  <p>Ten pages...</p>

  <p>Twenty pages...</p>

  <p>Thirty...</p>

  <p>After a while, Geoffrey soon climbed a certain height.</p>

  <p>The higher he went, the more threads the pages released. After he reached the thirtieth page, tens of thousands of light threads emanated from the page.</p>

  <p>On the eightieth page, he was finally able to leave the area of sand as stones began to make an appearance.</p>

  <p>"This should be within Stage One of the Other Shore. The power offered by the Other Shore Tokens in Stage One is very weak," Geoffrey remarked.</p>

  <p>He wanted to communicate with Ziya, but there was no way Ziya was going to hear him. He could only rely on himself to judge the things he saw.</p>

  <p>The items connected to the light threads were arranged by size, from smallest to largest, and there were also a few precious Other Shore Tokens strewn about, hidden in rooms of various shapes and styles.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey could only look at them in wonder.</p>

  <p>"The rooms on the Other Shore? The Other Shore Tokens in the temples..."</p>

  <p>He did not know much about the Other Shore and had to think for a while in order to understand.</p>

  <p>After entering the Other Shore, most Source World creatures made it their goal to explore the temples in the hopes of obtaining a decent Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>From here on out, the other ends of the threads connected to multiple inner worlds.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the size and shape of the Other Shore Tokens don't really matter," he muttered thoughtfully. "What matters is the place to which the threads connect."</p>

  <p>He was a thoughtful young man and as he continued to climb, he could judge the strength of the Other Shore Tokens with just a few details and observations.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens that connected to the outermost threads of the page were often ordinary, while those connecting to the inner ones were more precious.</p>

  <p>A bold idea then came to Geoffrey's mind. 'If I change the position of the thread, will the Other Shore Token's nature also change?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Eager to test his idea out, Geoffrey quickly made his way to the edge of the page. After a bit of careful investigation, he found that the root of the thread was a thumb-sized, square stone embedded on the page.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey reached out and tried to dig out this stone!</p>

  <p>To his amazement, it came loose! "It's moveable!"</p>

  <p>Just as he dug out the square stone, the thread that connected to the far distance also disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in an empty corner of Stage Two of the Other Shore, the huge Three-layer Stone suddenly lost its luster.</p>

  <p>Everything on the Other Shore, save for the soul pill, soul crystal, and a few other specific things, contained energy.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey took out the stone, he inevitably cut off the thread that connected to the Three-layer Stone and turned it into an ordinary rock. It was no longer an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Geoffrey walked to the inner side of the page and found a large number of black pits of the same size there.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he stuffed the stone into one of those pits.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>The moment the stone was fitted onto the slot, the thread once again appeared and extended onto the Other Shore. Once again, the Three-layer Stone's surface lit up, this time with red-orange light. The amount of power contained within the stone also rose by more than ten times!</p>

  <p>Two horse-faced creatures that resided in Stage Two sensed the powerful aura that was suddenly released from the distance.</p>

  <p>"What in the world happened over there?"</p>

  <p>These two were from the Triumph race, a very small group of horse-faced creatures in the Source World. They had no might nor any fame to their name.</p>

  <p>They had stayed in Stage Two of the Other Shore all this time because their Souls of Light were nowhere near strong enough to reach the higher stage.</p>

  <p>The two of them made the trek towards the Three-layer Stone and could not contain their amazement when they reached their destination.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't a Three-layer Stone normally contain only two or three divine megatons of power?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, but why does this one seem to have dozens of divine megatons of power?!"</p>

  <p>"I can feel its scorching aura! It seems to contain some sort of special fire ability!"</p>

  <p>"It's at the highest grade!"</p>

  <p>Their hearts boiled with excitement. The two of them had spent so many years here in Stage Two, but they suddenly came upon this strange Other Shore Token that could reverse their fortune!</p>

  <p>Nobody would believe a single word they said about this incident.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Geoffrey, who had seen all of this unfold, felt a strange feeling in his heart. It was when he raised his head to look at the endless black column that he realized it was the overwhelming feeling of omnipotence!</p>
