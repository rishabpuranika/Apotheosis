<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1055 Bewitching Domain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The speed at which a Soul Sea Realm warrior could fly was unprecedented.</p>

  <p>Any warrior that had to chase someone at such a high level could never hope to catch up.</p>

  <p>Even a Soul Sea Realm warrior himself would have difficulty chasing after someone of the same level.</p>

  <p>Taking this fact into consideration, the forces of the Sea God Continent had made the necessary arrangements to prevent the escape of the York Divine Kingdom's powerhouses. Over a hundred strong warriors hid within the nearby surroundings through the use of the Demon Night's secret treasure.</p>

  <p>This treasure was known as the Emerald Tree that could be used to conceal a warrior's Mu Ning. The seeds, once scattered, would germinate and turn into full-grown trees in just three days. These trees were short, about the height of a person, and were special in such a way that they allowed the people standing underneath to hide their Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>These trees were very effective when it came to planning an ambush, but they could not be used for escape. After all, the growth cycle of three days was too slow. If one ran for his life, he wouldn't need it.</p>

  <p>From these trees, over a hundred strong imposing auras were suddenly released and surrounded Master Wallace, Master Abraham, and the others of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Six Soul Sea Realm masters from the Demon Night, as well as Miguel and a few others from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, spread out their own domains.</p>

  <p>A domain was something that a warrior could have once he reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Each domain was unique to the warrior and was often based on the kind of cultivation technique he most excelled at.</p>

  <p>It was these various domains from the Demon Night and Purple Heart Sacred Place masters that enveloped both Master Wallace and Master Abraham.</p>

  <p>The two York Divine Kingdom masters were at a loss at their current situation. They had never foreseen such a thing coming!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was actually able to gather nine mighty Soul Sea Realm warriors!</p>

  <p>There were only a few Soul Sea Realm masters in the four divine kingdoms and Master Wallace and Master Abraham were two of them. Both held important positions in the York Divine Kingdom and enjoyed prestige that was even higher than the Holy Maiden's.</p>

  <p>Breaking through to the Soul Sea Realm was comparable to the transcendence of a mere mortal to an almighty immortal.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the abnormalities that had occurred in the universe, those in the Soul Sea Realm would've already ascended into the Upper World by now.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace did not hold the warriors of Central Region in high regard.</p>

  <p>He knew that a mere Life and Death Realm warrior had recently been able to stir up chaos in the continent. The only reason he brought Master Abraham along was his wariness towards the dragon that resided within Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of warriors from the four divine kingdoms, the Sky Northern Region was as safe as their own backyard.</p>

  <p>They strutted into the region as if they owned it. Their strength and power had gone into their heads as they arrogantly imposed their authority over all warriors in the continent.</p>

  <p>But their high and mighty airs had come crashing down the moment these powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors emerged from the trees and ambushed them.</p>

  <p>They could only rub their eyes and wonder if they were perhaps dreaming.</p>

  <p>How could such an unbelievable thing happen?</p>

  <p>The Central Region was not a conducive area to produce Soul Sea Realm warriors given its limited resources. How was it that nine high-level warriors suddenly appeared before their very eyes?</p>

  <p>Miguel led the warriors that surrounded the York Divine Kingdom masters.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly at his enemies' helpless position. "Last chance: where did the ancient jade come from?" he asked once again.</p>

  <p>The wheels in the heads of both Master Abraham and Master Wallace started turning. They did not have the patience to answer Luo Zheng's question and only thought about how to escape their current predicament.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Realm warriors behind them, however, thought differently.</p>

  <p>The only ones who could face against Soul Sea Realm warriors were Soul Sea Realm warriors themselves. Those in the lower cultivation realms could only expect to be reduced to cannon fodder.</p>

  <p>"I know! I know!" one of the Life and Death Realm warriors piped up.</p>

  <p>"That's the life stone that was dug out from the Feather Emperor Secret Land!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up. "Feather Emperor Secret Land? Is that located within the four divine kingdoms?"</p>

  <p>Master Wallace and Master Abraham both turned and glared at their noisy ally. "You think he'll let you off just because you told him what that bloody piece of jade was?"</p>

  <p>A trace of fear crossed over the man's features but his desperation for survival won over. No matter what the masters said, he had to hope that the information he gave would be enough to convince Luo Luo Zheng to let him live. "The Feather Emperor Secret Land is in the center of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>In other words, it's in the Feather Holy Sea!"</p>

  <p>It sounded as though the life stone was quite famous in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly had an urge to go visit. However, what he wanted right now was a preliminary verification. If it turned out that the ancient jade was actually extremely rare and hard to find, then he would have to think of his other options.</p>

  <p>Entering the Dragon Soar Arena to fly into the Genuine Dragon World was one of his options.</p>

  <p>His current strength couldn't qualify him to enter the Upper World, but if it was for Ning Yudie, he would scour the ends of the earth to make her better.</p>

  <p>He gave Master Wallace a faint smile. "Since he answered my question, I'll let him off. Kill everyone but that one guy who answered me!"</p>

  <p>The other Life and Death Realm warriors immediately felt regret at their decision of staying silent. The life stone wasn't necessarily a secret among the four divine kingdoms. Ordinary martial artists just did not have the luxury of interacting with these kinds of stones very often. They should've told Luo Luo Zheng when he asked.</p>

  <p>However, it was already too late. As Luo Luo Zheng gave his command, the York Divine Kingdom warriors erupted into a frenzy and launched their desperate counterattack upon his oncoming forces.</p>

  <p>The two Soul Sea Realm masters instantly released their own domains and Master Wallace actually dared to envelop Luo Luo Zheng with his as he charged towards him.</p>

  <p>He had no idea how this warrior at the middle stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm got the authority to command these Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm masters. However, there was no time to speculate. He had to eliminate Luo Luo Zheng if he wanted to live!</p>

  <p>This scrawny young man was surely no match for a master like him!</p>

  <p>And he was right. Luo Luo Zheng knew he was no match for the Soul Sea Realm master. He could perhaps take on a fourth or fifth-level Life and Death Realm warrior but a Soul Sea Realm master was a whole other story.</p>

  <p>There was just no way.</p>

  <p>So he smartly retreated and a figure immediately took his place. Miguel, who had the appearance of a transcendent being, stood protectively in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Miguel gave his opponent a faint smirk.</p>

  <p>"You should fight with me."</p>

  <p>Master Wallace hesitated at the sight of another person. However, the frustration he felt at the thought of not being able to eliminate Luo Luo Zheng allowed him to quickly get back on his feet. He quickly halted in his tracks and slapped his palm on the ground.</p>

  <p>A flash of brown-colored light swept through the battlefield, signaling the confrontation that brewed between the powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>None of the Life and Death Realm warriors could do anything but watch in combined fear and awe. This was not a fight that they could interfere in if they valued their lives.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace's light diffused around him. "Bewitching Domain!" he roared as the light expanded at an extremely fast rate.</p>

  <p>Those that were too slow and were enveloped by the Bewitching Domain immediately felt their heart beat wildly. A haze enveloped their minds and they had the sudden urge to attack the person nearest to them.</p>

  <p>It was because of the extremely powerful Bewitching Domain.</p>

  <p>Those drawn into the brown light were doomed to lose their sense of logic and mindlessly attack the people nearest to them.</p>

  <p>Given enough time, Master Wallace could envelop the entire Oracle City with his Bewitching Domain and wreak havoc all over the place. It would only take less than an hour for all martial artists to kill each other.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't really do that right now. Not when he was currently faced with nine Soul Sea Realm warriors. These were warriors on a whole other level who would not lose their minds in the haze.</p>
