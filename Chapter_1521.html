<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1521 Thunderbolt Annihilation </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The outermost layer of Luo Zheng's protection was made up of dozens of Nether God Shadows, while the sword light from the inner layer protected him like a spinning wheel.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's defense was impenetrable.</p>

  <p>But even so, he still found himself unable to block the advancing attacks of the three Celestial Mice.</p>

  <p>The awe-inspiring speed at which these three Celestial Mice advanced greatly exceeded Luo Zheng's anticipation.</p>

  <p>The three tiny golden rat shadows drilled through the dense ghostly Nether God Shadows at a speed which the human eye could not track.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's sword light revolved around him like a roulette, it was not a real one after all, just an illusion created by the sword's high-speed rotation. There were still gaps which the mice could use.</p>

  <p>Those Celestial Mice were so small that they could easily slip through these cracks and then they swiftly closed in on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff!"</p>

  <p>Three blood sprays spurted out as the mice bit Luo Luo Zheng, just like before.</p>

  <p>One of the mice bit Luo Luo Zheng on his clavicle. At the critical moment, he had leaned backwards slightly, otherwise his throat might have been severed by the rodent fangs.</p>

  <p>Although the wound caused by the Celestial Mouse's attack wasn't big, the mouse's teeth were almost invincible. Normal damage to Luo Zheng's body couldn't harm him at all, but when faced with the rat's attack, he couldn't resist at all! The teeth marks were vividly seen on his flesh.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak?"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the three Celestial Mice appeared nearby. They were still maintaining a cautious distance from Luo Luo Zheng and communicated with each other with high-pitched squeaks. However, a trace of ridicule seemed to glitter in those bean-sized black eyes.</p>

  <p>Legendary beasts were all known to have intelligence, so the Celestial Mice were no exception.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grew calmer and calmer as he watched his tiny adversaries.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Mice were ranked number one among all legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>Their race might even be second only to super legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>It was said that the reproductive abilities of the Celestial Mice was much stronger than that of other legendary beasts. Right now, Luo Luo Zheng was only facing three Celestial Mice, so the pressure wasn't too great. However, if he were facing hundreds of them, he might be running for dear life by now.</p>

  <p>In terms of speed, Luo Luo Zheng probably wouldn't be able to do anything to them.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't even be able to track their small bodies, how could he hope to kill them?</p>

  <p>The habits of these Celestial Mice were quite strange. If Luo Luo Zheng didn't move, they wouldn't move either. However, once he moved, they would launch the most precise series of attacks in the shortest amount of time.</p>

  <p>They were perfectly coordinated with each other. Human warriors would struggle to match their synchronicity.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng now stood quietly in the same spot, deep in thought. Not long after, a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Following the appearance of a few ripples on the surface of the sea of chaotic energy, the white smoke once again appeared around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Although this cultivation method was somewhat baffling, in many cases, it had the much desired effect of catching his enemies off guard!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng activated it, his entire body floated like a catkin or smoke on a breeze, and the three Celestial Mice leaped into the air once again!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>They were so quick that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't even see how they moved. He could only hear their squeaking sounds.</p>

  <p>Although he was unable to lock onto the figures of the three Celestial Mice, after the Eight Smoky Melodies was activated, he could be affected by any fluctuations in the air around him. Even the smallest energy wave could push Luo Luo Zheng into motion.</p>

  <p>The moment the first mouse pounced on him, it pushed Luo Luo Zheng backwards and out of the rodent's reach!</p>

  <p>The second mouse pounced over from another direction, and Luo Zheng's body changed direction again, still floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Then the third charged towards him.</p>

  <p>No matter how these three mice attacked, Luo Luo Zheng would always be able to maintain a distance of three inches away from them! Luo Zheng's eyes stared at the colorful mouse teeth in front of him, an indifferent expression now featuring on his face.</p>

  <p>The mice's pouncing speed was shockingly fast, but the speed at which Luo Luo Zheng was continuously reacting matched them perfectly.</p>

  <p>If someone witnessed this scene, they would definitely have been dumbstruck!</p>

  <p>This was because they would only see four intersecting shadows, and would not even be able to tell what these four rapidly flickering shadows were!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh?"</p>

  <p>While dodging the mice's attacks, Luo Luo Zheng was able to draw out strands of chaotic energy from his body!</p>

  <p>Half of the chaotic energy that he drew out was used to replenish the stores consumed by the Eight Smoky Melodies, while most of the other half floated in the air and some even silently sank into the ground.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy that floated in the air quietly connected together, forming a faint ring.</p>

  <p>The ring covered the surrounding space with a radius of a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a tiny bit of the mysterious Law Power began to form on the surface of the ring. The Law Power contained more than just the Thunder Law, and there were even lines of internal momentum intertwined within, as if tiny Genuine Dragons were intertwining with each other.</p>

  <p>This was the second cultivation method which Luo Luo Zheng had practiced in the past few years, the Thunderbolt Annihilation.</p>

  <p>It was the second cultivation method Gus had recommended, and it was very powerful.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Eight Smoky Melodies, the Thunderbolt Annihilation seemed a bit more normal. However, this was only "normal" to Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure what level of cultivation method it belonged to, or whether it was considered a Transcendent Divine Might. However, ever since Luo Luo Zheng had started cultivating it, he had discovered that this Thunderbolt Annihilation consumed an enormous amount of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>For an ordinary Soul Sea Realm martial artist, even if they had used up their Soul Sea, they still wouldn't be able to activate the Thunderbolt Annihilation, because it consumed too much life vitality. It was a costly cultivation method indeed!</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng had used a considerable amount of chaotic energy to arrange this Thunderbolt Annihilation.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was cultivating in the fairy palace, he had also observed the power of Thunderbolt Annihilation several times. However, this was the first time that he was using it in actual combat, and he was curious to witness its full effects firsthand.</p>

  <p>The three Celestial Mice were still swiftly chasing after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Speed was their greatest advantage. At this moment, they were also using their speed to the limit, stimulating their bloodline to the maximum. Their fur was even emitting a pure golden radiance as a result!</p>

  <p>However, what they could not understand was that no matter how fast they traveled, Luo Luo Zheng was merely adjusting his speed accordingly. He simply continued to drift out of their reach.</p>

  <p>If they sped up, Luo Luo Zheng would speed up, and if they slowed down, Luo Luo Zheng would slow down too. It was as if they would never be able to touch him, as if he were an illusion!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng activated the Thunderbolt Annihilation, a throbbing sensation started from within the depths of their bloodlines, causing them to feel a strong sense of impending danger.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the three Celestial Mice seemed to have come to an instant agreement as they fled in three different directions!</p>

  <p>Having lost the propulsion from the mice, Luo Luo Zheng once again came to a standstill, gently bobbing up and down in the air. He looked at the three disappearing mouse shadows as they scattered and fled, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a satisfied smile.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape!"</p>

  <p>After the ring had been formed, the surrounding thousand feet had instantly turned into a disaster zone.</p>

  <p>All living things within it would be baptized by the Thunder Tribulation, with the exception of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter how desperately the three Celestial Mice fled, they were unable to escape this calamity. Their yellow eyes were filled with fear.</p>

  <p>At the same time, their squeaking sounds became sharp and urgent!</p>

  <p>Enormous pressure suddenly formed in the sky. Mysterious Internal Momentum Law was arranged neatly in the air. Only when one was undergoing a tribulation would such a strange phenomenon occur.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had forcefully drawn this Thunder Tribulation over.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>In the sky, a thick dragon-like bolt of lightning circled around once before descending with white hot energy!</p>

  <p>This Thunder Tribulation, which had been attracted by Luo Luo Zheng, began to baptize the entire area within a radius of a thousand feet! The lightning struck simultaneously and continuously all over the area within the ring.</p>

  <p>Even at this moment, the three Celestial Mice did not choose to give up.</p>

  <p>They pushed their speed to the limit and even hid in the gaps that occurred between the branches of the lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>However, the power of this Thunderbolt Annihilation was too great. It nearly covered every inch of an area of a thousand feet. As more and more lightning gathered and the lightning became larger and larger, there were no more gaps left; the three Celestial Mice had nowhere to hide.</p>

  <p>Several minutes later, the sky gradually cleared and returned to normal.</p>

  <p>The three Celestial Mice lay smoldering on the ground, their bodies charred. Not long after, their corpses gradually disintegrated, and at the same time, each of the Celestial Mice created a thousand Illusion Points that moved swiftly towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"There are actually three thousand Illusion Points?" A smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>His goal had been the cave, but he hadn't thought that he would receive such a valuable reward for killing each Celestial Mouse. However, compared to what the other martial artists achieved, three thousand Illusion Points was nothing.</p>

  <p>Once a martial artist had killed sixty of the other martial artists, they would get three thousand Illusion Points as a reward. In the Illusion Battlefield, some radical martial artists had already killed thousands of their opponents, while reaping massive rewards.</p>
