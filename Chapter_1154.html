<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now if Zheng unleashed his strength fully, even if a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm activated his protective life vitality to the maximum, he still wouldn't be able to withstand a punch by the former.</p>

  <p>However, that did not mean Zheng was completely invincible. He was still going to be unable to defeat a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>After all, the strength of warriors who were at the peak of the Soul Sea Realm was calculated not only by their physical strength. Their speed, martial arts, cultivation methods, and mastery of laws were all better than Zheng and they could defeat him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mind right now was focused on the golden leaf, and he was going to use his own strength to smash it open so he could take out the Black Star pickax!</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng wanted to test the limits of his physical body.</p>

  <p>Thus, he began to gather the power of the dragon scales. However, just as he was about to pour the power of the dragon scales into his body, he suddenly heard Fiona shout from not too far away.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing? Where are you?"</p>

  <p>She had entered the arsenal along with Zheng and had been looking around the weapons scattered everywhere. Looking at the curses on them, Fiona was wondering if there was any way to purify the weapons and lift the power of the curses that lay upon them.</p>

  <p>Among various Original Laws, some of the laws were supposed to have similar effects at sufficiently higher levels.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Space Law, the Thunder Law, and the Fire Law all contained a similar effect – that of purification.</p>

  <p>However, the principle behind the purification ritual of different laws was different. The Thunder Law could create countless lightning sparks and a cultivator could release those sparks onto the target to purify it.</p>

  <p>However, the Fire Law worked in a different way. One could even say that the Fire Law burned the curses instead of removing them.</p>

  <p>Fiona had grasped the usage of a special type of flame: Purification Fire.</p>

  <p>The temperature of this Purification Fire was not very high. In fact, it was very low when compared to that of most common fires. Its lack of warmth could be judged from the fact that if one utilized this Purification Fire on normal firewood, the latter would remain completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>However, the Purification Fire was very effective against negative powers like the power of the curses. Similarly, it could also hurt evil creatures.</p>

  <p>However, Fiona wasn't sure if her Purification Fire could work on such powerful curses. They looked dangerous.</p>

  <p>Thinking about that, Fiona decided to give it a try. A milky white flame appeared in her hand as she began to burn the power of curse on a spear!</p>

  <p>Fiona's Purification Fire and the black flame in Zheng's mind were on two opposite extremes. The black flame in Zheng's mind could almost destroy everything. However, Fiona's Purification Fire would not cause any damage to weapons.</p>

  <p>When the milky white flames emerged, the black smoke on the spear began to disappear and dissipate slowly.</p>

  <p>'It works!' Fiona thought as excitement appeared on her face. She was happy because her flame had turned out to be very useful. For other divine-level talents, if they had been able to obtain a few clean sacred weapons from this cursed pile, they would feel very lucky. However, in Fiona's eyes, the value of sacred weapons was no better than that of trash.</p>

  <p>Even if her Purification Fire had the ability to eliminate the power of curses on these weapons, she didn't bother to purify all of these weapons.</p>

  <p>She only wanted to see if the Purification Fire was strong enough.</p>

  <p>Only then did Fiona realize that Zheng had gone into the depth of the arsenal. She then immediately threw away the spear and went to look for Zheng. Who knew what dangers he might have fallen into.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing…."</p>

  <p>She called out a few times and saw Zheng's figure suddenly appear. At the sight of him, Fiona covered her mouth with her hand and asked in horror,</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, what has happened to you?"</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw Fiona looking at him in surprise, he was extremely puzzled. What was wrong with him? He felt completely fine so why did she ask so? He had only devoured a great deal of the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>But he assumed that others wouldn't be able to know what he had done.</p>

  <p>The absorption of heavenly essence shouldn't have caused any change to his appearance.</p>

  <p>However, what Fiona said next startled him. "Tianxing! Did you somehow eat those weapons?"</p>

  <p>His heart started to beat faster at her words. He was unwilling to let anyone know about how he had devoured the heavenly essence. After all, the secret about the black flame and the mysterious furnace was only shared between him and Xun. Xun was his sword spirit and she was attached to his body, so she wouldn't tell anyone either.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" No matter how Fiona came to know about it, Zheng wouldn't admit it.</p>

  <p>Fiona pointed at Zheng's face and asked, "If you haven't devoured those weapons, why would the power of the curses be in your body? Look at the smoke that is coming out of your body!"</p>

  <p>What Zheng did not know was that after he had absorbed the heavenly essence, the power of the curses had not disappeared. Instead, it had gathered within his body.</p>

  <p>And that was the reason why Fiona was so surprised. Because the curses were affecting him now, in a strange way.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unaware that the power of these curses was powerful enough to cause a lot of damage to living creatures. Such damage usually appeared to the naked eye in two ways.</p>

  <p>It would either seep into one's body, slowly eroding the consciousness and taking over. Soon the person would lose his common sense, and start acting weird and even go insane and become a lunatic…</p>

  <p>However, this only happened when a warrior tried to carry a cursed weapon with him. So no one was willing to take these weapons with them.</p>

  <p>Judging from this characteristic of the power of the curses, one could say that the curses were similar to a poison. As for Zheng's body which was a sacred weapon, it was completely immune to this effect.</p>

  <p>However, the power of the curses also had another effect, which was to make these weapons highly vulnerable, rendering them fragile. The hardness of the weapons in front of them right now was only about half of what it had been before they were cursed. Zheng was going to have to pay attention to this negative effect. This was because his body was a sacred weapon, and if his body was contaminated with the power of the curses, his physical strength would be severely weakened!</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely unaware of the effects of the power of the curses.</p>

  <p>However, he would definitely not allow the black smoke to continuously emit from his body…</p>

  <p>Hearing Fiona's words, Zheng was shocked and immediately picked up a large saber from the copper box. The shiny blade of the saber was silver enough to act like a mirror. He looked at his image through the blade and found that there was indeed black smoke constantly rising from all over him.</p>

  <p>This was a bit troublesome. Zheng's heart sank as he asked, "What other effects do these curses have?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know..." Fiona blinked as she stared at Zheng with curiosity. She just couldn't figure out how Zheng had managed to get the curses onto his body from the weapons. Most people wouldn't be able to do that even if they wanted to. Unless a warrior carried a cursed weapon for a very, very long time indeed, he or she couldn't physically transfer curses.</p>

  <p>Did Tianxing really eat those weapons? These were fairy weapons. No matter how strong his body was, it was going to be impossible for him to digest them.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fiona curiously staring at him, Zheng felt helpless. Perhaps Fiona was easy to fool, and even if he didn't say anything, she would not keep asking about it. But the others weren't that stupid. If those powerful masters at Soul Sea Realm happened to see this, they would surely not let him go until he gave them a valid explanation. Then he would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing Zheng could do right now.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's conflicted expression, Fiona faintly smiled. She focused her beautiful eyes on the young man in front of him and told him calmly, "I don't know what the consequences of these curses are going to be, but they are definitely not going to be good. But don't worry, I can purify you!"</p>

  <p>"You can purify me?" Zheng was shocked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Fiona replied seriously. She wasn't the type of woman who joked around.</p>

  <p>"Since you can purify me, then..." A smile appeared on his face as he said half of what he had intended to say.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's line of reasoning, if he had such ability, he would purify all those weapons one by one and sell them out... But the woman in front of him was the dignified princess of a divine kingdom. Of course she didn't lack money and these fairy weapons and sacred weapons were nothing to her.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Fiona had figured out what Zheng wanted to say. She smiled knowingly and ordered him, "Don't move! And don't worry! I know what I am doing."</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, a milky-white flame rose from Fiona's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not feel any heat from the flame.</p>

  <p>"What kind of flame is this?" As Zheng stared at the milky white flame, a stunned expression appeared on his face and he couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>"This is the Purification Fire that can purify everything," Fiona replied and slowly pushed the flame towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>When it touched his body, Zheng didn't feel any heat. On the contrary, he actually felt a chill being emanated from it.</p>

  <p>Zheng found it miraculous that such a flame existed in this world, but as the chilling sensation continuously came to him, Zheng's mind became abnormally pure!</p>

  <p>That didn't mean he was losing his mind. Fiona's Purification Fire could not only purify the power of the curses, it could also purify all distracting and evil thoughts, as well as the ill intentions of all living beings. Of course, any normal person would have distracting thoughts throughout his life time. But when the Purification Fire was inside a person's body, his distracting thoughts would be temporarily cleansed. Once it left his body, his mind would return to its previous self.</p>
