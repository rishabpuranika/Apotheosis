  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Tracy and Jill were standing in the battle ring, many disciples taunted them besides Bass. The majority of male disciples from the 33 Peaks would always talk like that as they considered women to be inferior. Why did Tracy only punish Bass that fiercely? Simply because she had figured that Luo Luo Zheng would stop her.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's increasingly fantastic performance in the ring, Tracy's interest in him grew. Eventually, she thought that carving two holes in Luo Zheng's body would no longer be enough for her. And so, she came up with this crazy solution.</p>

  <p>'Well, if I defeat Luo Luo Zheng, how should I punish him?' Tracy thought as she walked.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, if Tracy left the ring randomly, the referees would declare her as the loser of the match. However, Cloud Sect was biased toward personal disciples including Tracy. In addition, she had a powerful background. The referees would never take the risk of humiliating her! Irritating Tracy would only bring them bad luck. Thus, spontaneously, they pretended not to see her leave.</p>

  <p>Jill had been waiting in the ring for a long time. She was an obedient girl who rarely lost her temper, and she was kind to people. Earlier, when the male disciples talked nonsense, she was offended, but based on her character, she didn't think of doing a cruel thing for revenge as Tracy had done.</p>

  <p>After walking past Jill, Tracy cast an indifferent glance at her opponent.</p>

  <p>Then she shook her head and said confidently, "You have strong talent and strength, but you're not my equal."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Jill lifted her chin in defiance. Disobedience reflected in her expression as she spoke with Tracy.</p>

  <p>"From your expression, I can see that you're not ruthless enough, especially for men," Tracy said with a faint smile. "If you can't be ruthless, you're not my equal as an opponent."</p>

  <p>Jill raised her eyebrows and said sharply, "Are you sure I am not your equal? I may not be ruthless toward men. However, that does not imply that I am not ruthless toward women."</p>

  <p>"You can be ruthless with women?" Tracy repeated. Her smile grew wider. "I don't believe you!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you can try and see if it's true," Jill said scornfully.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, she flipped the delicate little jade sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>Jill's martial arts style was dexterous and quick. Although the killing spirit of her sword was not strong, Jill could quickly and easily break her opponent's defense. In almost every match, she had landed the jade sword against her opponent's neck and won the match.</p>

  <p>Now that she was facing Tracy, a powerful personal female disciple, Jill knew that she couldn't hold back and had to do her best.</p>

  <p>Before Tracy could react, Jill launched a fierce attack by using her special weapon. Just as Jill had said, she could be ruthless to women.</p>

  <p>"Flower Lady Sword!" Jill cried.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, she took a step forward and brandished the sword.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a few streaks of life vitality were condensed and transformed into various kinds of flowers, which soon blended with her Flower Lady Sword. After taking a deep breath, Jill moved nimbly as she headed toward Tracy.</p>

  <p>Also, a hundred attacks launched by Jill's sword in a short period were flying toward Tracy.</p>

  <p>Jill was a serious girl. She was not only talented, but she also practiced extremely hard. To improve her swordplay skills, every day from early morning to sunset, she would practice, regardless of whether it was spring, summer, autumn or winter.</p>

  <p>Every day, she repeated the same actions. She would swing her sword and draw back her sword, hundreds of thousands of times. Although it was monotonous and boring, she would practice every day.</p>

  <p>She intended to reduce the time taken to launch a hundred sword attacks as much as she could.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of her practice sessions, the time that Jill needed to launch a hundred sword attacks was 5 minutes. The effort taken would also leave her body drenched in sweat.</p>

  <p>However, as she continued to practice, the time decreased from 5 minutes to 2.5 minutes.</p>

  <p>Later, it was reduced to the time for fifty breaths and then for forty breaths.</p>

  <p>And now, Jill only needed the time for three breaths!</p>

  <p>What would the time for three breaths mean to her? Within the time taken for each breath, Jill would have to launch over 30 sword attacks.</p>

  <p>The sight was scary indeed!</p>

  <p>The moment Jill raised her sword, most people saw a few sword shadows. Each of the sword shadows was accompanied by all kinds of flowers? peony, chrysanthemum, camellia, and so on.</p>

  <p>Considering the number of swords and their speed, it would be challenging for any opponent to elude them. If a person with weak martial arts were to be stabbed by the sword, they would die on the spot.</p>

  <p>But Jill was fighting Tracy. She was a woman indeed, but she also had special skills and could not be underestimated!</p>

  <p>As soon as Tracy waved her hand, a weapon appeared, and then, innumerable blue-grey sharp shadows flew out of her hand.</p>

  <p>"Ding, ding, ding?!" The crisp sound of weapons colliding with each other filled the arena.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to count how many attacks the two female disciples launched against each other as the audience couldn't see the attacks.</p>

  <p>They only heard the crisp sounds generated by Jill's jade-green sword radiance hitting Tracy's blue-gray sword radiance.</p>

  <p>The sword in Jill's hand was obviously not an ordinary weapon. It looked like it was made from jade, but when it clashed with Tracy's weapon, it made a crisp and melodious sound. It was also strong enough to not shatter on impact.</p>

  <p>After the first round of confrontation, the two women took a few steps back. Jill's chest heaved as she tried to control her breathing, but Tracy seemed quite relaxed. A smile danced at the corners of her mouth. It was not until this moment that the audience could see that the weapon Tracy was holding was a blue-gray Emei prick.</p>

  <p>"Wow, you are so fierce. I like you!" Tracy said with a charming smile.</p>

  <p>For some unknown reason, goose bumps spread across Jill's body when she heard Tracy say that she liked her. Instead of replying, Jill readied herself to attack Tracy.</p>

  <p>The two girls' martial arts styles were light and agile. Most male disciples were ashamed when they saw how graceful and quick the two women were.</p>

  <p>Because of their speed, the fight between the two women was very entertaining. Whenever they drew closer to each other, Tracy and Jill would launch dozens of attacks in an instant. In the blink of an eye, the two women would either withdraw suddenly or make use of an advantageous situation to continue the attack. To the audience, Jill and Tracy looked like two pretty butterflies engrossed in a fascinating dance.</p>

  <p>As a result, quite a number of disciples applauded loudly and heartedly.</p>

  <p>At that moment, no one dared to make any dirty or mean jokes about them. Tracy's and Jill's strength had shown that the male disciples were wrong to consider women as inferior. It was estimated that at least 99% of the male disciples would not be able to resist a single attack from them!</p>

  <p>The fierce competition between the two girls lasted for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>Then, a crisp noise was heard, followed by a scream from Jill. The crowd gasped as the jade sword in her hand fell to the ground. When the audience recovered from the shock, they saw the tip of Tracy's Emei prick pressed against Jill's eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Yet, judging from Jill's expression, it looked as though she were unwilling to admit defeat. Perhaps she was internally scolding herself for making mistakes and not exercising all her strength.</p>

  <p>Tracy then said, "Miss Quan, you seem unconvinced about your failure?</p>

  <p>It doesn't matter. If you don't want to surrender, I can give you one more chance. But you have to promise that if you lose, I will have the right to punish you in any way I see fit!"</p>

  <p>After that, Tracy gently stroked Jill's face. Apparently, she was teasing Jill.</p>

  <p>Jill was unnerved by Tracy's action. An expression of horror filled Jill's face. Hurriedly she turned to the referee next to her, and said, "I admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>Watching Jill's facial expression change rapidly, Tracy was a little unhappy and murmured, "What? Why did you act like that? You look like you've seen a ghost. I'm not a ghost."</p>

  <p>Jill picked up her jade sword and walked down from the battle ring, thinking, 'Actually, you are more terrifying than a ghost!'</p>

  <p>The competition between the two top female disciples was entertaining.</p>

  <p>Yet, since it was a competition between women, it was not bloody enough. On the whole, many disciples had significantly widened their horizons and they had become aware of the fact that the speed of martial arts could reach such an impressive state!</p>

  <p>Once the excitement died down, most disciples prepared for the next two matches.</p>

  <p>The first was a match between Hua Tianming and Jaden Wen, a personal disciple. In the second match, personal disciples, Yasser Yuan and Kimi Shi would battle against each other.</p>

  <p>In the previous match, Tianming did not draw his sword. His decision was regarded as arrogant and shocked everyone. He also succeeded in infuriating Jaden. As a personal disciple, he had never been subjected to this kind of insult before.</p>

  <p>But at the end of the match, Jaden had been defeated. The result showed everyone that Tianming was right not to draw his sword.</p>

  <p>The second match between the personal disciples, Yasser and Kimi, was equally fascinating. It almost destroyed half the battle ring. In the end, Kimi gained an edge on Yasser and won the match.</p>

  <p>These two matches could be regarded as the highest level of competition between Cloud Sect's disciples, as whether it was Jaden or Yasser, or Kimi, the three disciples had qualified to be in the top 10 in Cloud Sect's List!</p>

  <p>The gap between the disciples in the top 100 and those in the top 50 was not huge. However, the gap between disciples in the top 30 and those in the top 15 was greater. For the disciples who had reached the top 10 ranks, it was almost impossible to find a way to improve their ranking as their opponents were rare geniuses with special and powerful skills!</p>

  <p>In the next match, the referee suddenly announced, "Luo Luo Zheng Luo from Drizzle Peak will fight the personal disciple, Johanson Jiang!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! Johanson! It is said that Johanson is qualified to be among the top five in the Cloud Sect List. He is also said to be highly-skilled and a personal disciple of Saint Zara. I do not know how Luo Luo Zheng will deal with him. The match between the two will undoubtedly be very interesting. Wow, this is exciting! I must say that this year's All Peaks Competition is really impressive!" cried one of the disciples excitedly.</p>

  <p>"What? He is the personal disciple of Saint Zara?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed when he heard the other disciples. His expression reflected his vigilance.</p>
