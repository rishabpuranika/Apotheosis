  <p>
</p>

  <p>A gentle light from the Jade Wall of Legends enveloped Zheng and everything around him faded away. He had entered the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he wasn't sent to the battlefield directly. Instead, he came upon an empty room.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What happened?" Zheng looked around in confusion.</p>

  <p>In the past, he would always directly enter the battlefield with an opponent already pitted against him. Why then did he come upon this empty room?</p>

  <p>He walked around and noticed strange divine textures carved on the walls. As he looked around, he also found a small door tucked away on one side of the room.</p>

  <p>Zheng made his way towards the door and pushed it open. As soon as he did, a ray of light hit his eyes and momentarily blinded him. At the same time, he heard a loud noise.</p>

  <p>"So noisy..." he murmured as he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Outside was a huge annular space where small doors were densely packed in a spiral, forming a sort of staircase.</p>

  <p>In this space were countless low-rank True Gods. Some in small groups and barking loudly, others whispering to each other. There were so many of them which made the place such a mess.</p>

  <p>"Where the hell am I?" Zheng asked himself in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a proving godly warrior has come in," a young man wearing a golden crown bedecked with emeralds remarked. The young man had been standing beside Zheng and was now gazing at him with surprise.</p>

  <p>He sized Zheng up and his expression became even weirder. "Wow, he is an anonymous man!" he exclaimed loudly.</p>

  <p>His voice caught the attention of the other low-rank True Gods who also then stared at Zheng. With Joy's help, Zheng was able to hide not just his name, but also his appearance. Anyone who tried to look at him would end up seeing a blurred face and nothing more.</p>

  <p>"He really is a proving godly warrior."</p>

  <p>"Is he going to challenge higher-leveled warriors?"</p>

  <p>"Which powerful clan is he from? How can he have the confidence to challenge those of a higher level than him?"</p>

  <p>Challenging warriors of a higher level wasn't rare in the Arena of Legends. However, they only saw low-rank True Gods challenged mid-rank True Gods, mid-rank True Gods challenged the top-rank ones and top-rank ones challenged consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The difference in strength between a low-rank True God and a mid-rank one wasn't very big so there were a lot of warriors at the low-rank True God level who challenged those a level higher than them.</p>

  <p>It was much more difficult for a mid-rank True God to go against a top-rank True God since the latter could fly and thus had an advantage.</p>

  <p>The same could be said for a top-rank True God who went against a consummate True God. Even if the former could fly, he would still be unable to traverse through space thus making it hard to defeat the latter.</p>

  <p>There were still cases of these challenges though.</p>

  <p>Proving godly warriors, however, were different. They did not possess Godly Tiles which would make it difficult for them to challenge a higher leveled warrior. Many wealthy clans had talents who could participate in the battle of challenging higher leveled warriors but did not necessarily perform that well.</p>

  <p>This was the main reason why Zheng garnered such significant attentions when he entered.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was used to the attention. "Where am I?" he asked calmly.</p>

  <p>The young man next to him smiled. "This must be your first time in the Hall of True Gods. Proving godly warriors aren't really qualified to enter this place..."</p>

  <p>The Jade Wall of Legends was undoubtedly very special. It contained independent spaces of different sizes. These spaces were close to infinite, with some even more obscure than others.</p>

  <p>As the lowest leveled warrior in the Floating Island, a proving godly warrior did not have the qualifications to enter the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>They could only passively search for their own opponents.</p>

  <p>However, a low-rank True God was different. Each low-rank True God had their own independent room that allowed them to find a random opponent or choose a specific warrior to go up against.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw these rooms spiral up in the air. The height of each one represented the ranking of the low-rank True God who owned it. When the ranking changed, so did the position of the room. The higher it was, the stronger the True God.</p>

  <p>The young man's explanation clarified things for Zheng. Joy might have neglected to explain these things to him because she was just so used to it since she was a resident of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"I have just entered the Hall of True Gods and lost my match. Should I challenge you? What do you think?" the young man asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>He also cleared his throat after speaking, as an attempt to cover up his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to him! Come and challenge me!"</p>

  <p>"I've only been a True God for less than three months. My Godly Tile has just reached the preliminary stage and my entire foundation is unstable. I'm the one most suitable to be your first opponent!"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>It seemed Zheng had become quite popular with these low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>He could see why though. Whether he was a genius of a wealthy clan or not, in the end, Zheng was a mere proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>There were a handful of proving godly warriors who had created miracles in the past but they only appeared once in several divine eras.</p>

  <p>Most proving godly warriors had extraordinary strength but the absence of a Godly Tile greatly limited their power. They were still nothing compared to a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Right now, these True Gods regarded Zheng as a weak lamb whom they could hopefully earn a lot of points from.</p>

  <p>Feeling the enthusiasm of these low-rank True Gods, Zheng smiled and turned to the young man beside him. "In that case, I accept your challenge, though you will have to tell me how to do so." He still wasn't that familiar with the rules here and there might be a formality needed in order to accept a challenge.</p>

  <p>The young man was visibly pleased and excited upon hearing Zheng's acceptance. "Splendid! All you'll have to do is go back to your room and activate the divine textures on the wall..."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and quickly went back to his room while the young man also returned to his.</p>

  <p>All the other low-rank True Gods could only look on in disappointment and envy as a potential lamb was taken from their grasp.</p>

  <p>"Lucky Hardy."</p>

  <p>"It's alright. Since this proving godly warrior has already participated in such a battle, he won't be satisfied with just one battle, right? We still have a chance."</p>

  <p>"That's right. We can challenge that guy after his battle with Hardy is over."</p>

  <p>These low-rank True Gods all thought that Zheng would be easy to defeat and naturally didn't want to give up this opportunity. However, after a few discussions, they suddenly became silent. They looked at each other, with vigilance on their faces. Because of this anonymous proving godly warrior, they became competitors now.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was back inside his room and he followed the young man's instructions. He was quickly able to figure out how to use the divine textures on the wall. All he needed to do was to use the room number and he would be able to challenge anyone in the Hall of True Gods at any time.</p>

  <p>As he was fumbling around, one of the divine textures flashed. He touched it and immediately understood the information contained within: the young man had already challenged him.</p>

  <p>Hardy Qin from the Qin Clan. He had one hundred and ninety-three points and was ranked after one million and nine hundred thousandth.</p>

  <p>Such meager points were shabby for Zheng but were, in fact, normal for someone like Hardy who had just stepped into the Hall of True Gods and lost a battle.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly accepted the challenge and the scenery around him changed once again. He finally stepped into the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Hardy, his opponent, stood across from him. "Although it's unfair to challenge you with my cultivation level, you accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>Therefore, you yourself have chosen to participate in this battle. Surely you're well-prepared, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched his arms and legs, giving Hardy a smile. "Of course."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't be mercy," Hardy said, giving Zheng a polite bow. All wealthy clans paid great attention to points and rankings. As a direct disciple of the Qin Clan, the young man was under a lot of pressure and he was eager to win a battle in order to prove his strength.</p>

  <p>After bowing, a great power suddenly surged out from Hardy's body. He looked up and his eyes shone with confidence that he would definitely win.</p>
