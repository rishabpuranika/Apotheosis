  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Zheng had taken out the black box, he quickly began to deal with the bloody Dark Nether Bugs.</p>

  <p>It was just as he had guessed. The blood inside them was strongly attractive to living beings.</p>

  <p>That was why when he and Elvinia first saw the bugs, they felt a strange sensation.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng restrained himself and dismissed such feelings. On the contrary, Elvinia couldn't abandon the desire in her body, as she was a purified being.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had killed the stage ruler, he had also become a purified being and probably understood Elvinia's impulses. When he had opened the black box, he was eager to swallow the mass of blood and flesh. It was very difficult for him to restrain himself with his willpower alone.</p>

  <p>"Since it's because of the blood, the corpses can be disposed of..."</p>

  <p>He squeezed out all the blood from the Dark Nether Bugs, and then took out the broken corpses from the black box. The Light Region would completely devour the bug corpses once they arrived there.</p>

  <p>As for the blood in the dark box, he had tried to taste it, but he didn't feel that much of a desire except for being able to tell it had a delicious taste.</p>

  <p>Once he had confirmed that it was completely fine, he let Elvinia have a few sips. A smile graced her small face.</p>

  <p>"I almost ate this disgusting bug in the Dark Region. I didn't expect that I would drink its blood now..." she commented.</p>

  <p>Immediately after both of them shared the Dark Nether Bugs' blood, Zheng tried to release the Great Sanskrit Light and also let Elvinia try it.</p>

  <p>As Elvinia waved her hand, her body released a blazing white beam of light. The entire inner hall was filled with the white light for a while. "How do you feel now?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it has grown a little bit..." Elvinia answered hesitantly. "The blood has only a little effect. It seems this kind of bug isn't considered that precious.</p>

  <p>If you want to grow substantially, you might have to swallow a lot of bugs,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said with a grin.</p>

  <p>The ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore had stayed in the Dark Region for so many years, and he had devoured numerous Dark Nether Bugs. Yet, he still hadn't become invincible, which meant that consuming only one or two Dark Nether Bugs would have little effect.</p>

  <p>Elvinia just stuck out her tongue childishly and sighed. Although the Dark Nether Bug was quite attractive, she still felt nauseous at the thought of having to drink the blood of many bugs.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Guide Weasel race had already laid out the Other Shore Tokens they had previously collected.</p>

  <p>There were many Other Shore Tokens in this particular batch, totaling to more than six hundred. Some of them were weapons that the Giant race and the Guide Weasel race had treasured for many years.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng wouldn't secretly keep those Other Shore Tokens. After he and Elvinia selected what they wanted, he would ask Yan and the Nine Li members to pick their own next. Then, the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief could also choose their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Beside the Other Shore Tokens were two Ear Mice on standby.</p>

  <p>In the Guide Weasel race's opinion, all of the Other Shore Tokens were either relatively powerful weapons, or magic treasures that contained energy. It was hard for them to sort and separate the good from bad.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ear Mice were talents who were all good at dealing, and also adept at identifying the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>In addition, although the Other Shore Tokens in front of them were rare, they might have already seen, used or kept a considerable portion of them in the past.</p>

  <p>"Master Tianxing, there is only one sixth-grade Other Shore Token among them. Please have a look," one of the Ear Mice said when it saw Zheng.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng looked over and saw a golden sparrow statue.</p>

  <p>Based from its appearance, the sparrow statue didn't appear to be anything special. However, it was at the sixth grade, so it was likely that it wasn't as simple as it looked.</p>

  <p>"This Other Shore Token is called the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow," the Ear Mouse explained. "It has only appeared once in the history of the entire Source World."</p>

  <p>A trace of curiosity filled Elvinia's eyes as she stood beside Zheng and looked on. She asked, "What ability does this Other Shore Token have?"</p>

  <p>"Once the Other Shore Token has been fused, it can't be activated or used in normal times. It can only be activated after the owner dies," the Ear Mouse replied.</p>

  <p>"After death?" Zheng slightly frowned.</p>

  <p>He had seen similar abilities before. Some of the Latent Theurgies would only be activated after death, but since the owner was dead, what was the use of activating them?</p>

  <p>Even Elvinia just shrugged. They couldn't activate it until they died. No matter how powerful the Other Shore Token was, it didn't mean much if that was the case.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Elvinia's reaction, the Ear Mouse added, "Don't underestimate the ability of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. After it is activated, it will enter a state of wrath and kill and devour whoever kills you.</p>

  <p>It's extremely powerful!" "So what? It can only be used to kill the enemy after its master dies, right?" Elvinia muttered.</p>

  <p>"After it devours the opponent, it will give birth to its master again inside its body. Everything will be as good as before after its master's rebirth," the Ear Mouse said in response.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Zheng was shocked when he heard what the Ear Mouse had said. "It can bring its master back to life? You mean one can still be reborn even after they break into pieces?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Not to mention their broken bodies, even their magic treasures, weapons, and their space rings can be restored afterwards. Strictly speaking, the ability of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow is not to revive someone, but rather to completely restore its master and their items to the previous condition."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the abilities of Other Shore Tokens were always extremely amazing.</p>

  <p>For example, Chaim's golden abacus was a very powerful object. Even if he were to face a strong warrior in the Source World, let alone Mount with a low cultivation base, he could use the abacus to restrain their Other Shore Power, no matter how great it was.</p>

  <p>Such unique abilities were often beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>"If one could fuse with this Other Shore Token, does it mean that they can not be dead?" Elvinia asked. It appeared that she, too, was quite interested in the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Every time the one who has fused with it dies, one eye of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow will be blind. Once it gets blind three times, it would be completely destroyed and cannot be used again.</p>

  <p>Even so, since this Other Shore Token is in the sixth grade, it is definitely not weak," the Ear Mouse answered. "If it can revive its master infinitely, I think it can completely surpass the sixth grade, right?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Even the incomparable Other Shore Token like the Heart of Accomplice had quite a catch— one had to sacrifice their own life while they utilized it, and it was a one-time use only.</p>

  <p>Then again, to fuse with the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow meant being immortal, and it could even devour one's opponent. It was simply too powerful that Zheng felt it was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>Squeak! "It has limits. After you have activated it, it needs to devour the opponent to revive its master. Furthermore, it could only be used three times, and one eye will be blind every time you use it. Lastly, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow is not invincible. If your opponent has fled away after killing you, or if they are too powerful to be devoured, it clearly wouldn't be able to resurrect you," the Ear Mouse replied.</p>
