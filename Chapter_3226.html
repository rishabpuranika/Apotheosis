<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The second Zheng showed up in his house in the Flow Sword Sect, Margaret rushed to him, eager to ask him some questions.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had gone to the Clear Lake, he had taken his leave without saying goodbye.</p>

  <p>The fact Trish had returned alone, without Zheng, had left Margaret and the other women very worried about him.</p>

  <p>Now, seeing their beloved Zheng back home safe and sound, they felt so relieved.</p>

  <p>The women demanded an explanation. Zheng shrugged apologetically. He decided to tell them about his adventures at the Clear Lake, but he completely omitted his journey to the Phoenix Palace and Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Trish eyed him carefully. She knew that Zheng was keeping something from them, but she kept quiet. As a servant, she couldn't meddle with how her master chose to deal with these things.</p>

  <p>Barely a day had passed when someone knocked at the door of their house.</p>

  <p>When Trish opened the door, she was surprised to be greeted by a very excited Milo.</p>

  <p>"I heard that your master Zheng is back?" Milo asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>He was becoming more and more polite with Zheng. In the beginning, he didn't even have interest in knowing Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"My master just came back..." she answered hesitantly. Trish wondered how Milo knew so soon. Could he have hired someone to keep an eye on their courtyard house?</p>

  <p>It turned out her suspicions were correct.</p>

  <p>After Milo had gotten a part of the Truth Enlightenment, he started to study it at once and found a huge secret.</p>

  <p>Unable to contain his excitement, he had rushed to Zheng's dwelling to share the news, only to find out Zheng wasn't there. He had no choice but to wait for him to come back.</p>

  <p>Thus, he resorted to hiring someone to watch Zheng's house. He needed to be notified the moment Zheng returned.</p>

  <p>"I have something to tell him," explained Milo, his eyes twinkling excitedly.</p>

  <p>Trish couldn't see how she could refuse. With a meek nod, she went off to fetch her master.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw how Milo was practically giddy with excitement. His curiosity was piqued. 'Is he here for more words of Truth Enlightenment?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>"It's been a long time since you joined in the Flow Sword Sect, Zheng," Milo said with a curt bow. "I wonder what level of cultivation you're on with the truth swordsmanship manual..."</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrow in surprise.</p>

  <p>It had indeed been a while since he joined in the Flow Sword Sect, but he had obtained the Flow Swordsmanship only recently. Additionally, since he had been busy with the Seven Mountains Meeting some time ago, he hadn't really taken the time to study it til he got to the Clear Lake. Even then, he hadn't been able to study it that much.</p>

  <p>"I haven't grasped much of it," Zheng answered honestly. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>It seemed Milo grew even more excited when he heard Zheng's answer. "Then hurry and cultivate it! The first hundred and fifty words of your Truth Enlightenment are truly a perfect match for the Flow Strike, especially the first move of Heart Slaughtering Theurgy. When paired with the Soul of Light, it is extremely profound and powerful..."</p>

  <p>As spoke, Milo's eyes darted all over the courtyard, as though he were looking for something. Lacking a more suitable target, his eyes fell on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Zheng asked vigilantly. He noticed the crazed look in Milo's eyes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Milo activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. With a slight wave of his hand, he began to emanate a powerful aura.</p>

  <p>With a flash of light, Milo transformed into a giant sword and swung at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Heart Slaughtering Strike?"</p>

  <p>Zheng cried in alert.</p>

  <p>He could sense how strong the killing intent was. He darted backward warily.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng dodged the blade just in time. Channeling his power to his feet to act quickly, he prepared to strike back as his footprints left cracks in the pavement.</p>

  <p>The women, who were on the other side of the house at the time, were all shocked by Milo's sudden attack.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng successfully avoid his attacks, Milo came back to his senses.</p>

  <p>Transforming back to his human self, he glanced about the courtyard apologetically. "Ah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to give it a try. I didn't mean to get so carried away."</p>

  <p>Hearing the sincerity in his words, Zheng shook his head in annoyance. Yet, somehow, he was also amused. 'This fellow is truly obsessed with his sword...'</p>

  <p>"Your momentum... is that created by cultivating Truth Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Actually, Zheng already realized that even when he had just started to cultivate Truth Enlightenment. He just wanted to confirm this with Milo.</p>

  <p>After all, the Mind Sword of Truth Enlightenment, which transformed his thoughts into a sword, was similar to Heart Slaughtering Strike.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been too busy to study these days. Milo, on the other hand, kept practicing. Because of this, he had figured out the connection between the Truth Enlightenment and the Flow Strike sooner.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Milo's expression shifted from apologetic to elated in a split second.</p>

  <p>"Impressive, right?"</p>

  <p>"Soul-level methods are indeed very powerful," Zheng said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Milo laughed. "I've been killing many people in Other Shore the past few days. The people from the Bearing race are all scared of me!</p>

  <p>Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Within the first four stages of Other Shore, the three sacred temples of the human race were built together.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors within the first four stages were young. They tended to challenge each other, often resulting in soul-level confrontation.</p>

  <p>In earlier times when the four temples had just been built, everyone had gotten along fine.</p>

  <p>However, with the decay of the temple of the Nine Li race, the temples of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race, gradually rose to power. The Oneness Sky Palace's temple, on the other hand, grew to be at a disadvantage. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were often bullied.</p>

  <p>With the help of Truth Enlightenment, Milo had made great progress in cultivation. This earned some respect for himself and the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is..." Zheng nodded slightly in approval.</p>

  <p>It was true that the battles within the Other Shore were all soul-level. The warriors with a stronger soul would win. If the Flow Strike could work together with the Truth Enlightenment, it would indeed be a great help to them.</p>

  <p>Milo smiled at Zheng gratefully.</p>

  <p>He usually didn't like asking others for help, but he was thankful that Zheng had shared a hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment with him.</p>

  <p>He was determined to repay Zheng's kindness. This was why he shared this exciting news with Zheng.</p>

  <p>While Zheng knew he could've discovered this too on his own through cultivation, Milo's input could speed up the process.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already read through the Flow Swordsmanship, but there were some points he didn't understand. Now, with Milo's guidance, he was able to comprehend it all. His hands twitched, as he was itching to verify Milo's theory.</p>

  <p>Once Milo left, Zheng turned to Trish and asked her to help him apply for the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Ordinary disciples of the Flow Sword Sect could only enter the pagoda once a month, two hours at a time.</p>

  <p>But for elites like Zheng, there was no limit to the number of times he could enter in a month. However, there was still a limit to the time he could stay inside the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Even elite disciples couldn't stay inside for over four hours at a time. If they stayed longer than that, the Flame of Soul would consume them completely.</p>

  <p>Among all the elites, only Zheng and Milo were able to stay for a long period of time inside the tower. This was because, not only were they capable of Instant Enlightenment, but both of them also practiced the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng's personal record in the Flow Tower was a whole day and night.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Flow Tower was a perfect place for comprehending Flow Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>"Turn your mind into a sword.</p>

  <p>Use your mind to kill hearts..." Zheng chanted softly from the tenth floor of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>The white cyclone in his mind began to whirl faster and faster.</p>

  <p>With a gentle flick of his fingers, he seemed to slice the very flames around him. To his satisfaction, in his hand was an invisible long sword, with a power unimaginable.</p>
