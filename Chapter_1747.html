  <p>
</p>

  <p>Who was this old man…?</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng's strength had increased after returning from the Illusion Battlefield, he could only clearly feel that things around him seemed strange.</p>

  <p>It was as if he was being kept completely in the dark.</p>

  <p>But Xun's face explained everything. She seemed to have expected this, even though she didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>The old man circled the corpse of Sword Chen, floating slowly in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't sense a very strong aura from him, but this old man's aura was extraordinary, as if it had a very special affinity.</p>

  <p>As he slowly glided towards Finch, the old man gently reached out and the broken sword fell into his hand. "Catch it…" he said and tossed the broken sword towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"How can I catch it?" Zheng asked holding up his hands in pain. They were just bones now, resembling the hands of a skeleton, but Zheng had the astonishing ability to endure pain. If it was anyone else in his place, they would have surely passed out by now.</p>

  <p>He had even survived the torture of the chaotic energy, so such pain was manageable for him.</p>

  <p>Rumble…</p>

  <p>When Zheng finished speaking, the broken sword hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>The old man looked at Zheng's hands and sighed, "You should have thought of a way to come to our Celestial Position right from the beginning. You ran around on your own and caused a lot of hassles. You are too much of a troublemaker."</p>

  <p>The old man let out a gasp. There wasn't a single Soul Sea Realm warrior in the entire universe who appealed to dozens of Supreme Lords at the same time.</p>

  <p>It was not a big deal that Zheng had landed on the territory of the Humanity Alliance in his ascension, but it was a bigger problem when he ran around over the place. He had proved to be an uncontrollable factor, making it difficult for the Celestial Position to lay out their plans.</p>

  <p>Zheng should have made a trip to the Celestial Position before the Illusion Battlefield was thrown open, but he did not.</p>

  <p>This threw a spanner in the works for the Celestial Position. Xenia, a warrior from the Celestial Position was eliminated by Tianming, and Zheng had something to do with it.</p>

  <p>"I'm still young," Zheng replied with a smile. He had already guessed the identity of the old man. Back when he was trapped in the fairy palace, he got a message that the head of the Celestial Position, one of the most powerful warriors in the universe, had asked him to pay a visit to the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>The old man stared at Zheng for a moment and then nodded. "You're right.</p>

  <p>And you young guys are the last younger generation…"</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" Zheng was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled. "You will know in the future. Let me see your hands."</p>

  <p>Zheng obediently raised his hands and showed them to the old man.</p>

  <p>The old man gazed at the pair of skeletal hands. "Your bones can actually withstand the corrosion of the Corrosive Liquid; it's surprising! But now that your flesh has corroded, I'm afraid there will be a problem. Even if the flesh on your hands regrows, your hands won't be able to recover completely, but I will think of a way, now… let me do something to them first."</p>

  <p>The old man flicked his finger and green waves poured out of his hand.</p>

  <p>The green waves were made up of a viscous green liquid. It seemed to have a life of its own. The liquid flowed on Zheng's bony hands and coated his fingers, forming two hands. It looked as if Zheng was wearing a pair of gloves.</p>

  <p>At the same time, blood-red threads appeared and connected Zheng's bones.</p>

  <p>Zheng had originally lost some sensation in his hands. He could only feel pain from the torn flesh. They had become numb and itchy, but now he had regained sensation in his hands …</p>

  <p>Zheng pinched his newly-formed hands. The green liquid was translucent, and his bones were still visible through it. He could temporarily gain use of his hands, but the green color made them too conspicuous and they looked very strange.</p>

  <p>After giving the simple treatment to Zheng's hands, the old man stretched out his hands and then the broken sword flew back into Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng was able to grab the broken sword. He asked, "What is this for?"</p>

  <p>The old man replied nonchalantly, "This sword is a key item left behind by Sword Chen. Keep it safe. Now, it's time for me to take you out."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He had a lot of questions, but it didn't seem like the right time to ask. At the very least, he would have to take care of Finch first.</p>

  <p>"How should I deal with this guy?"</p>

  <p>His eyes met Finch's, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes. If it wasn't for the appearance of this old man, Zheng could imagine what would happen to him. Both he and Xun would probably die here.</p>

  <p>The old man coolly glanced at Finch and said, "He is just a clown. Let him stay here." After he finished speaking, he casually broke the hexagonal seal in which Xun was locked. With a light wave of his finger, a space crack appeared in front of him out of thin air.</p>

  <p>Xun's face had drained of color. Although she was still in the sword spirit form and Zheng couldn't clearly make out her condition looking at her appearance, he could sense her fatigue.</p>

  <p>If a sword spirit were to be destroyed over and over again, it would also collapse. More importantly, this sword spirit had Xun's soul in it.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun didn't want to say anything. She only paused to greet the old man before disintegrating into specks of red light and entering Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Just as the old man was about to enter the space crack, Zheng pointed at the corpse of Sword Chen and asked, "What about him? How should I deal with him?"</p>

  <p>The old man glanced at him and said, "It's just Sword Chen's vessel. He would have expected this day. Since he didn't give any orders, just let it sit there…"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't give any further thought to what the old man said, but Finch's complexion suddenly paled. Based on what this old man said, it seemed that Sword Chen already knew what he would do.</p>

  <p>Finch watched in horror as Zheng and the old man left, still unable to move.</p>

  <p>He only regained his freedom after the thousand-foot spider closed the bronze door.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he had been unable to break the bronze door to enter. Now it was all the more impossible for him to break open the door to escape. When he looked at the corpse of the former head of the Sword Manor, the fear in his eyes became more and more intense. Suddenly, he felt a chill down his spine, and in his trance, it seemed to him that the corpse moved a little, as if it was trying to slowly get up…</p>

  <p>After taking a few steps in the space crack, Zheng saw the old man open another crack and they arrived at the entrance of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>When they reached the entrance, they saw that the elders of the Sword House and Freya were waiting outside.</p>

  <p>Zheng was relieved when he saw her. Although he had deduced that Finch was lying, he still thought that she might be in danger.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, did you succeed?" Freya asked. She rushed over to him as soon as she saw him.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled rather helplessly and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the old man and asked, "Sword Chen told me that the Killing Sword Mountain would temper my sword intent and help me enter the Emotion Closing Godly Way, but why have I not gained anything from the Killing Sword Mountain?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's primary goal after coming to the Sword Manor was tempering his sword intent. But now, he had obtained a broken sword that he didn't know the use for. This was far from what Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing Godly Way? Ha-ha! Sword Chen is indeed a genius.</p>

  <p>He has already taught you the method," the old man said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"What method?" Zheng was confused again.</p>

  <p>The old man pointed at Zheng, "Malicious auras. Don't you feel that your body has changed after being infused with them?"</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment. "Yes, but can these malicious auras help me enter the Emotion Closing Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Moments ago, those countless small red spiders had turned into malicious auras and entered Zheng's body. What he did not know was that this was the last part of Supreme Lord Sword's swordsmanship. Using the malicious auras to change one's state of mind could make one more impulsive and determined, thus the person would charge forward bravely.</p>

  <p>The old man nodded. "When you can suppress and make use of these malicious auras with ease, you will be able to officially step into the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Keep practicing to control them; this is not difficult for you."</p>

  <p>"Suppress these malicious auras?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. Indeed he didn't have a way to control these malicious auras. How would he suppress them completely?</p>

  <p>"Don't make a fuss. Many cultivation methods that exist in this universe have malicious aura as the core. When you reach that step, you will naturally understand." The old man spoke in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

  <p>'Sounds like I have to figure this out by myself, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>
