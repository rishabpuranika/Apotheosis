<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3723 The Second Hand </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many soul hunters with strange shapes and peculiar figures had already emerged from the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>These hunters moved at an incredibly high speed all over the place. They moved on the ground, on the walls, and along the surface of the soul pillars.</p>

  <p>They were eager to find any chance to devour the Souls of Light as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Feng Ge and Dailey attacked them, the situation stabilized gradually.</p>

  <p>The two of them protected most of the Souls of Light, one on the left side and the other on the right side. As soon as the hunters jumped out of the ground, Feng Ge and Dailey would immediately attack them and tear them apart into a million pieces.</p>

  <p>However, when two deep dark blue eyes suddenly appeared in the massive golden cloud, all the hunters seemed to be frightened for their lives. They quickly moved on the ground to hide in the buildings around the Soul City...</p>

  <p>At the same time, the soul cloud emitted an extremely powerful aura, which seemed to be astoundingly irresistible.</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of this aura, those Souls of Light, which had turned into the Indigo Souls at the ultimate level, immediately trembled. They were shaking so badly as if they were naked in a world with nothing but ice and snow.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"What an intense soul pressure! I feel like I'm going to be torn apart!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! If the door doesn't open soon, we will all die here!"</p>

  <p>Even Dailey, who had already turned into the Colorless Soul and reached the Holy Soul Realm, felt great pressure as he looked up at the two deep dark blue eyes. He clenched his teeth together so hard and his face turned as pale as a ghost.</p>

  <p>The aura of the soul alone was already very terrifying. If the monster within the soul cloud came out, how could he survive at all?</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge was already protected by her physical body and felt slightly better than the rest, the powerful and overbearing pressure also made her incredibly pale and shocked. She didn't think she could resist that thing and survive with her physical body.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the pair of deep dark blue eyes, the corners of his eyes also twitched crazily.</p>

  <p>He had encountered many dangerous experiences and resolved countless crises in his life, but the pair of deep dark blue eyes that he was facing now were undoubtedly the most dangerous type he had ever encountered!</p>

  <p>"Where can I find fire to light the pot? It's simply..."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was feeling extremely anxious, his eyes fell on Feng Ge. His heart skipped a beat as an idea popped into his mind. The divine flames of the Jin Wu! Because of her bloodline, Feng Ge could use this soul token!</p>

  <p>In the Dark Region, Feng Ge had lit up candles through the divine flames.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was so anxious about what was happening just now that he totally forgot about it.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he grabbed the shiny golden pot on the ground and rushed towards the door.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to reach the door with the golden pot in his arms, the pot was suddenly controlled by a huge force and firmly fixed it at the door. Luo Zheng was caught off guard and was thrown out of the cabin with a spire. Fortunately, he grabbed the ladder and didn't fall all the way down.</p>

  <p>The golden pot could never be taken out of the cabin!</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng roared as he hanged on the ladder.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who stared at the pair of huge eyes in the soul cloud, didn't dare to even move a little bit. When she heard Luo Zheng shout, a trace of confidence suddenly blossomed in her heart.</p>

  <p>As long as she and Luo Zheng stayed together, no matter how big and difficult the crisis was, they could overcome it!</p>

  <p>"I need flame!</p>

  <p>Give me the flame as fast as you can. Fire can disperse these demons and ghosts!</p>

  <p>It might also help in opening the door of the Soul City!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's booming voice attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"What? Did I hear that correctly? Can he really disperse these souls?"</p>

  <p>"He can still open the door? Is that true or is he just lying?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether he is telling the truth or not. We should believe him and at least let him try."</p>

  <p>When the Souls of Light heard Luo Zheng's loud shout, their hearts were immediately filled up with hope.</p>

  <p>After understanding the meaning of Luo Zheng's words, Feng Ge took a step forward, then quickly passed by the soul pillars, and ran wildly into the depths of the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a wisp of slender flame appeared in Feng Ge's hand.</p>

  <p>She could use the divine flames of the Jin Wu gracefully and skillfully. As she sprinted, she reached out her hand and gently pointed towards Luo Zheng, who was standing outside the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The wisp of flame turned into a long thin thread and it shot towards Luo Zheng from the distance.</p>

  <p>The cabin was more than three thousand feet high. Even with such a long distance, Feng Ge could still release the flame with ease. As the thin thread continued to extend towards the cabin, the deep dark blue eyes flickered gently in the soul cloud behind Feng Ge. They revealed a trace of malicious aura.</p>

  <p>As the soul cloud surged, a ginormous hand suddenly stretched out!</p>

  <p>The skin of this hand was as rough as a bark of a tree. Its surface was also covered with neoplasm, which looked extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Just as Feng Ge was concentrating on releasing the flame, Luo Zheng suddenly shouted from above, "Watch out! Something is behind you!"</p>

  <p>When she turned around, she realized that she had no time to dodge as the giant hand had already reached her. With a scream, she was grabbed by the hand, and the wisp of flame that she had released was broken...</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Feng Ge is caught by that enormous hand!"</p>

  <p>"What are we supposed to do now? That's our only hope!"</p>

  <p>"Stop it!"</p>

  <p>As the scene unfolded right before their eyes, many Souls of Light were shocked to their core.</p>

  <p>Dailey and the others also realized that the reason why the door closed in advance was definitely because Luo Zheng had entered the small cabin with a spire. And the only chance for them to leave the Soul City was that Luo Zheng used the flame to help them!</p>

  <p>Even if the monster within the soul cloud was ridiculously strong, they could only fight with all their might.</p>

  <p>All of the Souls of Light, including Dailey, tried to stop the huge arm before it caused more damage.</p>

  <p>However, even Feng Ge, who had a physical body, was unable to break free from the strong hand. When these warriors attacked the giant hand, it was as if they were tickling it since it had no effect at all.</p>

  <p>"Break up!"</p>

  <p>A strong desire to survive rose from the bottom of Dailey's heart.</p>

  <p>His hands suddenly transformed into two long whips with sharp edges.</p>

  <p>With countless sharp whip shadows, they cut crazily and deeply on the huge arm.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>The bark-like skin of the arm was cut by the long whips. Bits and pieces of the skin were scattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>Dailey had reached the Holy Soul Realm and obtained a Holy Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other Souls of Light, he could at least do some damage to the giant hand.</p>

  <p>"Dailey! We need you! Cut off this hand now!"</p>

  <p>"If the hand is cut off, it will automatically release Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>"Come on! Do it now!"</p>

  <p>Many Souls of Light encouraged Dailey's spirit and gave him hope.</p>

  <p>However, this injury was nothing to the giant hand. It was not even a flesh injury. Instead, what Dailey did only enraged the monster within the soul cloud more.</p>

  <p>Just as Dailey was carefully cutting the hand, a black shadow suddenly appeared in the soul cloud. It was another hand!</p>

  <p>"Ah, damn it..."</p>

  <p>Dailey suddenly felt an ominous premonition in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The hand quickly descended from the sky and slapped Dailey to the ground.</p>

  <p>The ground in the whole Soul City was trembling because of the impact.</p>

  <p>When the huge palm left the ground, Dailey had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge kept struggling to escape from the first hand, but she couldn't move at all because the huge hand was around her waist.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to be dragged into the soul cloud, the thought of the deep dark blue eyes staring at her sent a chill down her spine.</p>

  <p>In despair, she suddenly thought of her right hand!</p>
