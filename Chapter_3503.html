  <p>
</p>

  <p>Following her sojourn into the Dark Region with Zheng, Feng Ge's personality changed slightly, but not by much. She just became gentler toward Zheng. She was still indifferent to everyone else, especially Dorothy when they were alone.</p>

  <p>"I never said Zheng belonged to me," Dorothy retorted, feeling even more embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"But you were even willing to sacrifice your life for him. Why would you go that far if you don't want him to be yours?" Feng Ge spoke.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, Dorothy had used the Heart of Accomplice regardless of the consequences. Feng Ge had been floored by that. She never realized she had such a terrifying Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"I had no choice. The situation called for it," Dorothy pointed out, a little annoyed. Her patience was growing thin.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge felt smug seeing Dorothy so flustered.</p>

  <p>She asked her the next question bluntly. "Do you like him?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy was once again rendered speechless. She paused before replying,</p>

  <p>"That is none of your business."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Feng Ge leaned forward and hissed in Dorothy's ear. "Of course it's my business. He belongs only to me."</p>

  <p>Dorothy was stunned. But being used to Feng Ge's straightforward manner, she responded just as frankly, "He already has a family."</p>

  <p>"So what?" Feng Ge straightened up. She now possessed the body of a purified being created through imagination. It was even more perfect than her previous body in the chaos. It radiated a different charm.</p>

  <p>She looked up at the large vortex in the distance. "That is his past. I am talking about the future."</p>

  <p>Dorothy frowned at Feng Ge's apparent conviction.</p>

  <p>She didn't know what Feng Ge was thinking. But from what she knew of Zheng, he would never just put his past behind him.</p>

  <p>"What makes you so sure of that?" Dorothy asked slowly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge ignored Dorothy and put on a cold face, as usual.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, Feng Ge did hate Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, after their travel in the Dark Region and having regained her memory, she gradually became interested in him.</p>

  <p>In the Phoenix Palace, Feng Ge was able to chat with her three "disciples", mostly about Zheng's past.</p>

  <p>Xun, who was a woman of few words, had spent the longest time with Zheng.</p>

  <p>But one thing they had in common was when they were talking about Zheng, their faith in him was evident.</p>

  <p>This level of trust shone clearly on their faces.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's tragic experiences in the Divine Lair made her regard everything around her with hostility and indifference.</p>

  <p>Even with Flamine consoling her all these years, her trauma wouldn't heal, and nothing could make her happy.</p>

  <p>She wanted what was lacking in her life.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge suddenly found herself envying how Liusu and the others looked so happy and trusting when they spoke of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once the envy took root, the desire for that kind of happiness grew uncontrollable and became a mad obsession.</p>

  <p>When they were at the Chaotic Source World, Feng Ge finally felt, too, that Zheng was a person she could trust unconditionally. She liked the feeling of being able to trust someone that deeply.</p>

  <p>As the women were caught in their discussion, Chaim busied himself with something else.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace took the Cloud Flying Wheels and flew away, one by one.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng's physical body arrived at the destination, having crossed Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Dorothy silently walked up to Zheng and handed him another Cloud Flying Wheel. After that, Zheng let his physical body dissipate. He returned to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>By this time, more than half of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace had already gone.</p>

  <p>Zheng held the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand and walked toward the edge of the stone platform. Dorothy and Feng Ge followed behind him in silence.</p>

  <p>They intended to go with him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze fell on Feng Ge. "The purified being dominates a certain stage.</p>

  <p>After a living creature on the Other Shore becomes a purified being, they can only stay at that stage. I wonder if you can leave."</p>

  <p>Creatures on the Other Shore were fixed at the stage they were in after becoming purified beings. Zheng had learned this from Athemar.</p>

  <p>However, Feng Ge was an exception.</p>

  <p>She was not a being on the Other Shore, so Zheng didn't know whether she would be limited by this rule.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked at this. "I have asked my father. He also wants me to try to see if I can reach Stage Fourteen."</p>

  <p>It would be a good thing for the Oneness Sky Palace if Feng Ge could dominate only Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>But if she could continue to be promoted and reach other stages, it would be a new record that could make others uneasy.</p>

  <p>A purified being who could grow and become more powerful was enough to change the structure of many forces on the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>"In that case, you can wait here," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze passed over Feng Ge and landed on the place where his physical body disappeared. Feng Ge immediately understood.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was not a purified being, he could also reach the Other Shore with his physical body. After all, Zheng needed to cross twice. Feng Ge could wait for Zheng and complete the crossing with Zheng the second time.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for you, then," Feng Ge said, nodding at Zheng's explanation.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were somewhat puzzled when they heard this. Zheng was obviously here. Why would Feng Ge still wait for him? Perhaps only Chaim, Dorothy and a few other warriors understood.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng and Dorothy activated the Cloud Flying Wheels in their hands.</p>

  <p>As a cloud of mist rose, Zheng's Soul of Light flew in the air, followed by Dorothy's.</p>

  <p>After they flew out for some distance, Zheng looked back.</p>

  <p>From this vantage, he could clearly see the layout of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. It was like a huge island, with the Dark Region spreading from its flanks like dark clouds.</p>

  <p>Below Stage Thirteen's lower edges, many thin lines extended down.</p>

  <p>Zheng surmised all these lines must be connected to the Star Doors of Stage Twelve. But from this angle, Zheng could not see where it was.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng suddenly thought of the space where King Manard was.</p>

  <p>Although King Manard considered the space to be the second Other Shore, it was not that large. It was incomparable to the real Other Shore.</p>

  <p>To create the thirty-three stages in the chaos was truly a magnificent feat.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, be careful," Dorothy reminded him.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng turned around to look, a colorful energy ribbon darted toward him. He gently turned over the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand. As a puff of mist spread around, he easily dodged the ribbon.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to enter the energy vortex. He could enter it as long as he was careful.</p>

  <p>All the disciples who ascended earlier had been sucked into the energy vortex successfully, but it was hard to say whether they were able to pass through it.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Dorothy got closer to the vortex, a strong gravitational force started to pull them in.</p>

  <p>The force was so strong that resistance was futile. The closer they got to the vortex, the greater the gravitational force became.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Both of them were sped along faster and faster in the air until they were sucked into the vortex.</p>
