<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The short creature walked towards Ziya in wobbly little steps. His fearful, vigilant gaze never strayed from the two of them.</p>

  <p>They could also sense many similar gazes falling on them from those buildings. Apparently, many similar creatures were watching them from the dark. But there was nothing strange about this. After all, they were strangers here and aliens to them.</p>

  <p>The short creatures could feel that Ziya was powerful. Their guts even told them that he could exterminate all the creatures on the island with just one finger if he desired it.</p>

  <p>"Gulu... Master... Welcome...What...What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>This race had its own language, but when this short creature realized that neither Ziya nor Geoffrey could understand their language, he started to speak in human language.</p>

  <p>A trace of surprise appeared on Ziya's eyes.</p>

  <p>He'd long known that the human language commonly used on the Other Shore wasn't created by the 77th civilization. Nevertheless, this place was another world, and it was still unknown whether or not there were humans in this world.</p>

  <p>"Master, it's been ages since I last spoke in the common language. Please forgive me if you can't understand what I say..." said the short creature. He saw that Ziya was in a daze, so he thought that Ziya couldn't understand what he said.</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn to speak the common language?" Ziya asked.</p>

  <p>"The common language... is a very old language. Once upon a time, all creatures in the Dream World spoke in this language," the short creature said. A longing expression emerged on his face as he recalled that prosperous era. "Now, I'm the only one in the tribe who knows it."</p>

  <p>The short creature's hair was sparse, and his skin was crumpled. He had lived on the Other Shore for a rather long time.</p>

  <p>"The Dream World he referred to should be about the same as our Other Shore, right?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so." Ziya nodded and then asked, "What happened to the Dream World? Why did it become like this?"</p>

  <p>Ziya's question made the originally gentle and cowardly short creature show an aggrieved, indignant expression on his face.</p>

  <p>This short-statured creature was of the Dark Fiend race, a race that had once occupied a dominant position in the Dream World.</p>

  <p>The Dream World was a very huge annular world with fifteen rings from the outside to the inside. The stronger a race was, the more qualified they were to enter the inner ring. The former headquarter of the Dark Fiend race was located in the fifth ring.</p>

  <p>At that time, this short creature had just been born. His young self often imagined that like the other talented individuals of their race, he would fight for their race and bring the Dark Fiend race to a higher level of glory after he grew up.</p>

  <p>But before he became stronger, a disaster already descended upon the Dream World.</p>

  <p>A strange force that had lurked in the Dream World for many years suddenly started rounds of purging in the Dream World. Even the world of poisonous mist wasn't spared.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the Dream World was destroyed, and almost all intelligent creatures in the Dream World were either killed or injured.</p>

  <p>When the Dream World was destroyed, one of its fragments, within which some creatures happened to be trapped, was bounced out and became the island where they were now.</p>

  <p>Along with the passage of time, the creatures also grew in number. Now, many years after the incident, the island already became densely populated.</p>

  <p>Every place, every corner on the island was occupied. This was how these crowded buildings could come about.</p>

  <p>"Did that strange force have a name?" Ziya asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they called themselves the Nihility!"</p>

  <p>Even after so many years, the short creature still gnashed his teeth with hate every time he said the word "Nihility". After all, this race had destroyed their homeland and everything they had once had.</p>

  <p>Ziya was also stunned to hear the name "Nihility".</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey had never been to the Other Shore, he had stayed together with the Regal Jade Spirit and Ziya, so he was quite knowledgeable. He asked, "The Nihility race also exists in this world?"</p>

  <p>What appeared in Ziya's mind was the appearance of the Grandmaster of Heaven, the junior fellow disciple of his master.</p>

  <p>The last time he returned, Ziya had a long chat with his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, so he had, of course, learned about the current situation of the human race.</p>

  <p>It was quite a shock for him to learn that the amiable Grandmaster of Heaven had become the leader of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Compared to other major races on the Other Shore, the Nihility race appeared relatively late. It was only the 748th civilization. Despite its late birth, this civilization could advance by leaps and bounds. This was something that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and others had never understood.</p>

  <p>Now, the answer finally dawned on Ziya's mind.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the Nihility race didn't come from the chaos.</p>

  <p>So there might still be another existence behind the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The short creature told Ziya everything he knew. However, he was a native creature of the Dream World; he only knew about the situation in the Dream World but didn't know much about what happened with the world of poisonous mist.</p>

  <p>Because of the short creature's limited knowledge, he couldn't answer many of Ziya's questions.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, when Ziya finished questioning the creature, he turned around and pointed to the distance. "Do you want to go to the world over there?"</p>

  <p>The short creature's eyes suddenly lit up. "Master, can you send us there?"</p>

  <p>Creatures of both the Dream World and the world of poisonous mist relied on absorbing poisonous mist as their primary means of survival. This island was densely populated, and there was little poisonous mist on this island.</p>

  <p>The island opposite them, however, was practically covered in dense poisonous mist clouds. For the Dark Fiend race, those poisonous mist clouds were like out-of-reach delicacies they could only see with longing.</p>

  <p>Many of the younger members of the Dark Fiend race drooled over the poisonous mist clouds all day long.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ziya.</p>

  <p>The short creature immediately turned around and spoke to his clansmen in their own language.</p>

  <p>The quiet island suddenly became even quieter.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, deafening screams exploded from all over the place, causing the buildings on the island to shake from the noise.</p>

  <p>"There are many poisonous animals and plants in that world. Aren't you guys afraid?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>The short creature turned around and faced them once more, saying proudly, "Those poisonous animals and plants are just creatures without any intelligence— the growth of their strength will always be limited. Besides, our Dark Fiend race isn't a weak race."</p>

  <p>Thus, Ziya started to shuttle back and forth between the two islands. The pure energy flow between the islands wasn't at all a trifle, so Ziya had to be extremely careful when he was escorting the Dark Fiend race to the other island.</p>

  <p>It took Ziya two whole days to send all the members of the Dark Fiend race over.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all members of the Dark Fiend race were going all-out in sucking the poisonous mist. Geoffrey could only shake his head to see their intoxicated looks.</p>

  <p>Now that he had fulfilled his promise, Ziya said to Geoffrey, "Let's go.</p>

  <p>There's nothing else here."</p>

  <p>A world of deathly stillness indeed wasn't of much value— at least, not according to Ziya.</p>

  <p>"Wait," the short creature called out. "There's one more thing that I think you should know."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" Ziya asked.</p>

  <p>"Before the Dream World was destroyed, the elders of our race secretly mentioned some things to us. I heard that the Dream World was built by the Four Spirits Sect, and the human spirit in the sect looked exactly like you," the short creature said.</p>

  <p>"The Four Spirits Sect..."</p>

  <p>Ziya and Geoffrey looked at each other. Shock once again swept over them.</p>
