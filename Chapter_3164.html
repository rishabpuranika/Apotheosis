<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng cultivated the Flow Strike a few days ago, he came across a strange problem which left him puzzled.</p>

  <p>The Flow Swordsmanship was very different from the other supreme swordsmanship manuals. It was a method used to train the mind, and it contained several extremely powerful killing skills, all without any specific cultivation method.</p>

  <p>According to the records, if one remained in the Flow Tower long enough, they would be capable of mastering the skills on their own. Zheng had been cultivating for a very long time, yet he still could not master any theurgy.</p>

  <p>However, the translation of Sanskrit words that Zheng had just read could transform his thoughts to a sword. It was somewhat similar to the Heart Slaughtering Strike in the Flow Swordsmanship. But Zheng just could not figure out what it had to do with the Heart Slaughtering Strike.</p>

  <p>The translation written by Geoffrey was about 1, 000 words long.</p>

  <p>Zheng kept the fine sword radiance forming in his mind in check and read on.</p>

  <p>Despite his best efforts, the sword radiance continued to accumulate, growing stronger and stronger against his will.</p>

  <p>After reading 50 words, the sword radiance had grown so powerful that Zheng could no longer contain it. It felt as if it could erupt like a violent volcano at any moment.</p>

  <p>If this sword radiance was released, it would most likely cause more damage than the sword radiance which had cut Geoffrey's soul open.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned, still trying to hold on, but he had to pull himself away for a second. The sword radiance gradually dissipated as he stopped reading and waited.</p>

  <p>When he had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, though the pressure was great, it was not fatal and he had managed to make progress little by little.</p>

  <p>But this was very different. Trying to understand the Sanskrit words was proving to be quite dangerous. Had he misunderstood something?</p>

  <p>'Even the True Gods, who aren't perfectly compatible with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, don't encounter such great resistance when they cultivate for the first time. Did I do something wrong at the beginning of the cultivation?</p>

  <p>These two Sanskrit words were arranged behind the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, so should I recite the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent before reciting and comprehending them?'</p>

  <p>The thought sparked a flame in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>He then recited the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent...</p>

  <p>He could now do it quite quickly, uttering the last word after about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p>Zheng then fixed his eyes on the paper again and continued to read the content that Geoffrey had deciphered.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>This time, the sword radiance in his mind did not appear.</p>

  <p>Instead, an invisible cyclone began slowly rising up, bringing with it a peculiar feeling to Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>'What's this?'</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was unsure what it was, he had a guess of what it could be.</p>

  <p>If he directly read the words translated from the Sanskrit words as they were, it would produce the sword radiance to attack him. And if instead he read those words after reciting the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the cyclone would appear.</p>

  <p>Both the cyclone and the sword radiance contained frightening energy.</p>

  <p>But to Zheng, the cyclone now felt gentle and harmless...</p>

  <p>After a short pause, Zheng began to read once more. The cyclone expanded as he did so and the pressuring power returned.</p>

  <p>After reading around 100 words, Zheng could read no more. Even with the current strength of his Soul of Light, he still could not bear the pressure the cyclone exerted.</p>

  <p>Yet feeling it in his mind excited him.</p>

  <p>"It appears that the two Sanskrit words do indeed follow the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent!" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and the Truth of Cultivation Nature had never produced any special energy. These two kinds of truth were related to instructions on using and understanding the energy. They were different from the Godly Ways' internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Now that a cyclone appeared, Zheng naturally found something new and special.</p>

  <p>But how would one utilize the cyclone?</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to get it out of his mind or transfer it to his sword, but after several attempts, he still got nothing but failure.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps this cyclone is too weak. It hasn't completely taken shape yet...' he speculated.</p>

  <p>Over the next five days, Zheng tried making use of the cyclone or growing it further by reading more than 100 words. Still he failed over and over.</p>

  <p>However, every time he tried, he felt a change in the cyclone. He couldn't say what it was, but he felt it undeniably.</p>

  <p>This change was not any of Zheng's doing. It felt as if this cyclone was like a living creature. When the cyclone dispersed, it even turned into countless tiny and intangible things which began to wander around!</p>

  <p>Moreover, it moved through the same route every time, but Zheng couldn't understand why.</p>

  <p>Five days later, Imran appeared in Zheng's courtyard again. The Seven Mountains Meeting was to be held today.</p>

  <p>Zheng made some preparations and exited the courtyard with Imran.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Seven Mountains Meeting to be held?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Please, follow me," Imran responded with a smile, ignoring Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>After walking alongside these independent courtyard houses for a while, they saw that more than 20 people, including Konnor, were waiting in the empty area before them.</p>

  <p>And in the middle lay the most exquisite flying ship Zheng had ever seen.</p>

  <p>He had seen many flying ships before, but this one was abnormally luxurious. The outer layer of the flying ship was embedded with a smooth shell, the railing wrapped with a delicate fabric embedded with the gold threads. This was truly beautiful beyond what he imagined a flying ship could be.</p>

  <p>These elites of the Flow Sword Sect were both gifted and from the rich clans.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, this way please," Konnor said with a smile as he made a welcoming gesture.</p>

  <p>Once everyone had boarded the flying ship, it trembled slightly before flying off at blinding speed. When it reached the midair, a honeycomb-shaped enchanted barrier suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>It was the enchanted barrier of the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Not just any flying ship could go in and out of the Oneness Mountain without permission. If one tried to break in by force, the flying ship would be smashed to a million pieces.</p>

  <p>When they passed the enchanted barrier, two more flying ships flew out from the Oneness Mountain, each moving to fly on either side of the ship Zheng was in.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the young men in the two flying ships whistled loudly.</p>

  <p>"You are filled with the fighting spirit this year! Konnor!"</p>

  <p>"I don't see Milo. Is he too much of a coward to attend the competition?</p>

  <p>If he doesn't come, it's probably best for your Flow Sword Sect to give up!"</p>

  <p>The men on the two flying ships burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>Hearing the taunts, the elite members of the Flow Sword Sect were displeased. Konnor even steered the ship to descend slightly and avoid the other two ships.</p>

  <p>The men on the two ships required no introduction. Zheng could quite easily guess they were from the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>"Konnor, if they're also from the Oneness Mountain, why are they hostile to the Flow Sword Sect?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Konnor pulled a long face after hearing Zheng's words. Finally he said with a smile, "The Oneness Mountain is the dominant mountain of the Oneness Sky Palace. The three sword sects are just competing for their own interests. This keeps the balance in the mountain. If the three sword sects join hands, no other mountains could compete with them. Thus the three sword sects also compete with each other."</p>

  <p>This was not the whole truth, but Konnor did not reveal that to Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Flow Sword Sect was the weakest among the three sword sects.</p>

  <p>Some time ago there was even word that the Flow Sword Sect would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect were always disdainful of the Flow Sword Sect. It was not until the appearance of Milo that the Flow Sword Sect's reputation had been rescued.</p>

  <p>However, Milo had no intention of taking part in the Seven Mountains Meeting. That was why Konnor hastily searched for Zheng to participate in this competition.</p>
