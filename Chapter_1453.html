  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng decided to face the ogre warrior's hammer head-on, a lot of people thought that he had lost his mind.</p>

  <p>Because essentially, in a situation such as this one, the odds of winning were completely against a Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>In the general run of things, when human warriors engaged in battle with ogres, they would opt to think of something else and would in no way face the enemies head-on.</p>

  <p>That being said, at this moment, a strand of cold light manifested on Luo Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword all of a sudden. And at the same time, an immeasurable amount of malicious Mu Ning began gushing out from his body.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, an unstable malicious Mu Ning spread out, effortlessly keeping the Ancient Evil Ape's Mu Ning that the ogre warrior emitted in check. Not long after, everyone watched as Luo Luo Zheng slashed his five-footlong sword down on the giant hammer.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At the point of impact between the long sword and the giant hammer, the only thing the crowd could hear was a somewhat muffled sound. It was in no way clear whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The next scene they witnessed left everyone watching from the sidelines utterly dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The Earth Law which had been enveloping the dark golden giant hammer had just gotten shattered by Luo Zheng's sword with such ease.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the slash from Luo Zheng's sword came out with a relentless force, splitting the giant hammer in half without difficulty.</p>

  <p>It was worth mentioning that the ogre warrior's hammer had already been infused with his full power. If it were in the Lower World, even a continent would collapse from that mighty hammer strike.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the slightest bit fazed. Quite the opposite, at the swing of his sword, it gave the impression that the giant hammer was made of tofu from the way that it had been split into two, ending up in such an unthinkable form. On top of all that, one more thing that had been cut in that same moment was the body of the ogre warrior himself.</p>

  <p>It should be pointed out that the ogre warrior, in no way, underestimated Luo Zheng's capabilities.</p>

  <p>What happened with Luo Luo Zheng and the other two ogre warriors in the Endless Abyss was still vivid in everyone's mind. By now, they probably would've realized already how they should not be writing Luo Luo Zheng off just because he was still at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm. In silence, each of them thought that they should keep a watchful eye on him.</p>

  <p>In any case, the ogre warrior had taken the initiative just now, given the fact he actually thought highly of Luo Luo Zheng as his opponent. That was also the main reason why he let out his bloodline's power during the battle. What he had in mind was that he needed to give Luo Luo Zheng a lethal blow the second he came into contact with the ground.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, there was just no way he could've known that Luo Luo Zheng would end up using quite an intimidating method such as using his sword to directly clash with his own giant hammer.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, he never could've possibly thought that the power expelled by Luo Zheng's sword would be so far beyond what he had expected it to be.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>And just like that, a mountain-like body along with a ten-foot-long giant hammer had been split in half by Luo Luo Zheng. A bone-chilling amount of blood gushed out in all directions. Most of the warriors made use of their life vitality to cover themselves, protecting them from the blood that was spurting towards them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held his sword horizontally. The blade of the sword quivered and the blood on it vanished in an instant. After that, he gently moved his hand and pointed the sword toward his own finger. The long sword proceeded to go into his space ring.</p>

  <p>From within the Sumeru Space, Luo Luo Zheng had been utilizing a place to serve as his weapon storage area. He had actually constructed a row of sword racks that held sword-type weapons in particular. So, when the Thunder Wind Divine Sword went into the Sumeru Space, it directly perched itself on one of the sword racks.</p>

  <p>"Ancient Evil Ape bloodline? Meh!" Shooting the lifeless body of the ogre a quick glance, Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his arm to reach for his space ring.</p>

  <p>He forcibly removed his spiritual mark and poured out all of the items stored inside it.</p>

  <p>A warrior's space ring tended to contain a lot of various items.</p>

  <p>After picking up the icy lotus from all of the cluttered items spread out on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng didn't even bother paying attention to anything else.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, he didn't so much as bother paying any attention to the hundreds of life vitality jades lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>With the icy lotus in his hand, he approached Freya and told her, "Next time, if you come across a situation such as this one, try not to fight back. You should just ask me to lend you a hand."</p>

  <p>Freya was in a state of euphoria at the moment. In her eyes, Luo Luo Zheng had the appearance of a superhero. Just how many people would be willing to do something for others? Probably not a lot.</p>

  <p>She understood full well how genuine Luo Zheng's words were.</p>

  <p>From the moment he grabbed the space ring to the point when he picked up the icy lotus, Luo Luo Zheng was perfectly laid-back, keeping his guard lowered down.</p>

  <p>The other warriors who had intended to gang up on him before had been caught completely off-guard, simply keeping silent as they watched him move.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that they had been planning to come at Luo Luo Zheng all at the same time, they couldn't gather the courage to pull it off. As they marveled at the lifeless remains of the ogre warrior, they could already tell what the outcome was going to be if they were to raise arms against Luo Luo Zheng. The strength this guy possessed was comparable to that of a devil, and these people, who were merely at the Spirit Supreme Realm, wouldn't even be worth mentioning before Luo Luo Zheng. Deep inside, a few of those warriors couldn't help but feel an immense fear.</p>
