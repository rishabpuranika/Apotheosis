<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even in a family as small as the Luo's, there were lots of disagreements.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Alex grew up in a family with third-grade forces.</p>

  <p>Although Alex was a heaven-level talent, if he didn't work hard for the clan, he would be eliminated. The Gongsun family was a large family, and if someone wanted to stand out, they couldn't rely on talent alone.</p>

  <p>So, even though Alex thought of Luo Zheng as weak, he couldn't let his guard down. Throughout the world, the number of martial artists easily killed by opponents was enough to fill Hell. As smart as Alex was, he wouldn't make such an obvious mistake.</p>

  <p>After listening to Alex, Zheng's eyes flashed brightly with an idea. He smiled and said, "Not bad."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng's praise confused Alex and he wasn't sure if he'd heard him right.</p>

  <p>"You're smarter than those idiots if you can understand the concept of a lion fighting a rabbit, so, you're accomplished enough to be my foe," replied Luo Zheng as he chuckled.</p>

  <p>Alex froze at Zheng's response.</p>

  <p>He'd anticipated Luo Zheng to say something weak, or even beg for mercy. If he was in a good mood, he might've even spared Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>He hadn't considered Luo Zheng complimenting him. Alex was having a difficult time accepting the huge contrast at the moment.</p>

  <p>Arrogant people usually had a good reason, but what did this kid have? Luo Zheng was only at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, making him nothing more than a lamb before slaughter.</p>

  <p>Alex could accept a stronger opponent looking down on him since in the warriors' world, whoever was strongest had the respect. If he was looked down on because he was weak, then he deserved it. But, to be disdained by someone weaker than him, Alex couldn't take that.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that? The brat at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm actually said Alex was qualified to be his opponent!"</p>

  <p>"That's the funniest thing I've heard my whole life."</p>

  <p>"When did the Illuminating Soul Realm juniors start bragging at the Martial Arts Contest?"</p>

  <p>When they heard Luo Zheng, the other local cultivators from Oracle City joined in the clamoring.</p>

  <p>Alex angrily said, "Very good, with a single sentence you've gotten me angry. Since I am, you must be prepared to accept baptism by my anger!"</p>

  <p>"Zing."</p>

  <p>Two mid-grade fairy weapons, one green and the other gold, vibrated.</p>

  <p>Then, the arena's enchanted barrier disappeared.</p>

  <p>The battle started.</p>

  <p>"One move and you die! Let me show you the Consummate Sword Intent!"</p>

  <p>Alex waved his swords, causing a purple cyclone of sword intent and a golden one to entwine around each other, and he rushed headlong at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Gongsun Dancing Sword!"</p>

  <p>There was a Gongsun in the past who did a sword dance, and the story of how he used to stun everyone was passed down from generation to generation. The technique Alex was using was passed down from generation to generation in Gongsun Clan!</p>

  <p>The fact that Alex could cultivate two Consummate Sword Intents showed just how talented he was. His steps created a pattern as he elegantly slid towards Luo Zheng, swinging the two swords!</p>

  <p>'This is a sword dance! It's extremely mysterious, but compared to Lily's sword dance, it's still inferior. How weird to see a man dancing with his swords!" Zheng's body started to move rhythmically.</p>

  <p>The moment his body twisted, forceful energy erupted!</p>

  <p>There were actually many areas where body refining and life vitality refining overlapped. For example, when body refiners reached the later stages, they could shape their forceful energy into something they pictured in their minds. However, that wasn't the advantage of forceful energy!</p>

  <p>Compared to life vitality, the greatest advantage of forceful energy was explosive speed!</p>

  <p>Life vitality was gathered in the cinnabar field of the body. When a martial artist needed life vitality, he'd extract it from the cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>But forceful energy was found throughout the whole body, and erupted much faster than life vitality. At the same time, the eruption of power was much fiercer, but, it required a martial artist's body to be very strong to be able to withstand the jolt from forceful energy! Of course, this was no big deal to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the forceful energy erupted in Luo Zheng, a faint golden light enveloped his body. While Alex performed his dance, Luo Zheng was as agile as a small weasel, rapidly darting around the would-be dance floor, dodging the swords.</p>

  <p>"Fleeing? The day you escape is the day the sun grows cold, hahaha.." Alex had already completely entered the state. The characteristic of this set of Gongsun Dancing Sword was its continuance. One move after another was stronger than the last!</p>

  <p>Therefore, what Alex feared most was his opponent to fight him head-on, because in that case, the power of his sword dance moves wouldn't be seen.</p>

  <p>But the deal with Luo Zheng, well, his worry seemed unnecessary.</p>

  <p>When they saw Luo Zheng retreating, the martial arts practitioners watching from the stands began to cheer.</p>

  <p>"Force him into a corner! Let's see how he dodges then!"</p>

  <p>"Once Alex begins the sword dance, there is no escape! He'll have no choice but to fight directly!"</p>

  <p>"But, Alex has two Consummate Sword Intents and Luo Zheng hasn't even drawn his weapon. How is he planning to fight Alex? Does he think he can use his fists? I'm afraid before he can get close enough to Alex, he'll already be torn to shreds by the sword intent!"</p>

  <p>Alex's dance became more stable, and his moves became more powerful.</p>

  <p>"Pair of Beauty Shadows!"</p>

  <p>"Brilliant Anticipation!"</p>

  <p>"Bright Moon in the Sky!"</p>

  <p>The sword move names came from the dance moves, so they were poetic.</p>

  <p>However, concealed within the layers of poetry was killing intent.</p>

  <p>"You have nowhere to run now! Die, scum!" Taking a few more steps, Alex corralled Luo Zheng in a dead end corner. Alex taunted, "It's useless, even if you knelt before me and begged me to show mercy! Flowers under Bright Moon!"</p>

  <p>With that, the two swords simultaneously slashed outward in semicircles, combining to form a perfect full moon!</p>

  <p>"Sching! Chang!"</p>

  <p>The light crisp sound of metal rang out as Alex's consummate sword intent reached Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The sharp consummate sword intent left white marks across Zheng's skin.</p>

  <p>After they struck, Luo Zheng grasped at the swords using an extremely precise method.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Alex's surprise at Zheng's move was evident. Luo Zheng stood in front of Alex, as Alex glared at him.</p>

  <p>The martial artists up in the stands were as dumbfounded as Alex.</p>

  <p>Did Luo Zheng just use his physical body to resist Alex's consummate sword intent and steal his swords?</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>With the ear splitting cracking sound, both of Alex's swords were snapped in half at the bare hands of Luo Zheng! They were mid-grade fairy weapons, though!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng snapped the swords, he punched Alex squarely in the chest.</p>

  <p>"Oaf...!"</p>

  <p>As Alex went flying, he spat, and a long ribbon of blood extended a hundred feet long in the middle of the arena.</p>

  <p>In the end, he landed on the edge of the battle stage, crashing down with all his might and he lay, unmoving on the ground. His life was more or less gone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw no need to kill anyone and opted not to. His goal at the Martial Arts Contest was to kill Marilyn. Before that happened, no matter how much he hid his strength, someone would try to force him to show his ace.</p>

  <p>If he was too bloodthirsty, it might make Marilyn wary of him!</p>

  <p>The local warriors up in the stands were deathly silent. The situation had changed so quickly, they couldn't even react. In fact, even Alex himself didn't have time to react. Before he fainted, he still hadn't figured out what he did wrong.</p>

  <p>What Alex didn't know was there wasn't anything he'd done wrong, it was just that he was too weak compared to Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>On the high platform, Brent, the Ethereal Spirit Sect disciple blinked his eyes and said, "Wow, he's really strong! I probably couldn't beat him when I was at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm."</p>

  <p>The eldest disciple from the Ethereal Spirit Sect shook his head and said,</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. I judged him wrong. Luo Zheng used forceful energy, and he's a body refiner. Perhaps he has a secret technique that allowed him to break Alex's sword intent, suddenly. If my memory serves me correctly, you already comprehended half of the Space Law when you were at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, right? He wouldn't have been your equal back then."</p>

  <p>Being able to comprehend half of the first level of the Space Law when in the Illuminating Soul Realm would have shamed even the old guys such as Morphens of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"That might not be the case." Brent's estimation of his strength was very accurate.</p>

  <p>The eldest disciple continued, "Brent, you're the most talented warrior in the history of the Central Region, and the only divine-level genius from the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Don't compare yourself to a guy like Luo Zheng, or you'll lose your warrior spirit."</p>

  <p>Brent grinned. "Alright, I understand! In any case, as long as this brat perseveres, I'll challenge him sooner or later!"</p>
