<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1787 The Godly Geniuses </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerers paled.</p>

  <p>They had hesitated for a long time before choosing to be patient and let the people on the Divine Kingdom Continent off.</p>

  <p>Their conspiracy was more important compared to killing the people off.</p>

  <p>So they decided, after a discussion, that they wouldn't fight as long as the people didn't trespass the center of the storm.</p>

  <p>They just pretended that this had never happened.</p>

  <p>The warriors that suddenly appeared had extraordinary strength. But they hadn't thought, even in their wildest dreams, that these warriors were, in reality, the Godly Geniuses!</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race had lived on the other side of the world for all of eternity, which was why they hadn't seen the Illusion Battlefield before and hadn't recognized them.</p>

  <p>"If they're Godly Geniuses, then�"</p>

  <p>"Not just the Celestial Position race, I'm afraid even the Thoughtless Minds, and the Humanity Alliance will pay attention to their every move!"</p>

  <p>The universe was so chaotic that it was almost unimaginable how the Supreme Lords could tolerate the Godly Geniuses going anywhere far from them.</p>

  <p>But now that they had dared allow them to come here, they must have had a motive, some cards up their sleeves that they had hidden.</p>

  <p>This would be big trouble.</p>

  <p>"I knew the people from the Pure Jade Sacred Place would cause trouble if they barged into the Lower World. But they did barge into this great world and it's my fault!" Daly's body was shaking more and more violently. If he had known about it earlier, he would have killed them in the ascending passageway. He shouldn't have worried too much and now, it had led them to one of the most troublesome situations ever.</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race's methods were scary, and even Daly knew that he had made an unforgivable mistake. He could only imagine the kind of punishment he would have to face.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer snorted. Daly's heart quaked as the supreme sorcerer said, "Right now, it is a problem, but also a chance to get rid of the Godly Geniuses."</p>

  <p>"But the Netherworld Crystal Towers aren't ready yet. If the Supreme Lords are alerted, wouldn't our efforts be of no use?" Dean objected.</p>

  <p>Supreme sorcerer was silent for a moment. He then said, "We can't wait.</p>

  <p>We don't have enough time. We can only spread out the Netherworld Crystal Towers in advance."</p>

  <p>"This-" Dean hesitated.</p>

  <p>"We have arranged thirteen Netherworld Crystal Towers so far and that took us a countless number of years! It's a difficult decision for me to make as well!" Supreme sorcerer said coldly.</p>

  <p>The two grand sorcerers relaxed a little but it looked like the supreme sorcerer really didn't have the time to argue with them.</p>

  <p>"When will we spread them?" Dean asked.</p>

  <p>"I will give you the instructions before we need to act," supreme sorcerer said coldly.</p>

  <p>The two grand sorcerers nodded. They had already understood that the sorcerer race's higher-ups had already moved the plan ahead of schedule.</p>

  <p>Preston and the others continued to stay in the Divine Kingdom Continent, recovering their consumed life vitality while Luo Zheng brought Ning Yudie back to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't even imagined that his trip down to the Lower World could go this smoothly. It had, in fact, made him suspicious because it shouldn't have been this easy.</p>

  <p>They traversed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars again. Nathan and Lawson suggested that they should go to the center of the storm and take a look.</p>

  <p>But Tianming and the others stopped them.</p>

  <p>That storm was too dangerous. Anyone who entered it rashly could probably lose their life.</p>

  <p>They headed south and soon crossed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and returned to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Once this matter was resolved, the Godly Geniuses were required to return to the Celestial Position and wait for Master Feng's arrangements.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie hadn't met in a long time, which made it difficult for him to just turn around and leave.</p>

  <p>Imogen was excited at Yudie's safe return and all her grudges against Luo Zheng disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't gone back on his word, after all, and had brought Ning Yudie back safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had not seen his mother for a while and clung to Ning Yudie like a nimble little monkey. He refused to let her go, afraid that if he did, she would run away.</p>

  <p>Margaret's mood soured at this, but was also relieved at the thought that Luo Zheng couldn't stay in the Central Region forever.</p>

  <p>A few days later, there was a great feast at the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>All top figures of the great sects in the Central Region were attending the feast, reminiscing the old days with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite Patrick's and Lewis's cultivation levels being relatively low, they were both placed in the front.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere at the banquet was quite warm. Everyone in the Central Region was curious about the people around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, may we have the honor of knowing who the almighty beings around you are?" Dillon said, smiling a loopy smile, now that he was a little drunk.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He hadn't introduced all of them yet and no one from the Central Region had heard of them. So he introduced them by name, one by one.</p>

  <p>They were already familiar with Tianming and Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As he introduced each of others, Lone, Lucille and Kurt stood up and greeted everyone, acknowledging Zheng's introduction. The strength and status of those people around them might not be worth mentioning, but they were still Zheng's friends.</p>

  <p>But Nathan and Lawson behaved as if they hadn't heard Luo Zheng. Nathan even looked away from him, making it even more awkward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care. He hadn't expected Nathan and Lawson to come with him. He was disappointed that they were acting so smugly, but because the universe was in such a crisis, he knew that he couldn't treat these two men as his enemies.</p>
