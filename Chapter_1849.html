<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1849 Reversal </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon, the surrounding scenery transformed rapidly.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the journey route comprised of natural primitive caves. But later on, the landscape changed, revealing a lake and a flat mountain wall. The structures seemed to be man-made.</p>

  <p>There was also a grey dusky, unidentifiable object circling endlessly in the empty lake below.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Teigan, staying close to the boundary, swiftly moved ahead.</p>

  <p>Since there was no other way, they decided to see what existed at the end of the path.</p>

  <p>The man-made lake was only about three miles long. At the end of the lake, there was a long and narrow passage.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the lake, they discovered that the bottom of the passage was an endless pit!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Teigan looked at each other, clueless about the next step. Then Teigan took out a wooden stick from his coat and waved it in the air. And the end of the stick suddenly burst into flames.</p>

  <p>Teigan threw the flaming stick down into the pit.</p>

  <p>The two of them saw the flames increasingly become smaller for a long time before disappearing deep inside the pit.</p>

  <p>Teigan despairingly said, "What do we do now? We cannot even make out its end!"</p>

  <p>When they fell from above and reached the artificial lake, they were already deep in the depths of the Sacred Spring Mountain. They had absolutely no clue as to where they would reach, if they went inside this pit. They were not even sure if they would make out alive with the strong attraction force.</p>

  <p>"It seems like this place is also a dead end. There is no other way out now," Teigan said anxiously. He was afraid of being trapped to death and now that was definitely happening.</p>

  <p>"There's a way," Luo Zheng said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What! Where is it?" Teigan hurriedly asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his hand and pointed upwards.</p>

  <p>The passageway in front of them had formed into a vault, above which there was another passageway, embedded on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"This way!" Teigan soon discovered that the passage beneath their feet was connected to the passage above their head. The problem was that they were unable to pass through it.</p>

  <p>If only they could fly, they wouldn't have to go through all these problems.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he turned around and looked at the lake behind him.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng entered the Sacred Spring Mountain, he discovered that the strength source reversed and flowed in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>The reverse system seemed to be carried across the strength source. If that was the case, then there had to be some sort of mechanism within the Sacred Spring Mountain that controlled the reverse system.</p>

  <p>For the time being, seeing the passageway hang from the ceiling lifted Zheng's spirit.</p>

  <p>The secret path in front of them was definitely designed to allow people to pass through. The gravitational force there was so great that even a great martial artist could not fly in the air, but rely on the reversal gravitational force to pass through.</p>

  <p>So this mechanism had to be somewhere around here!</p>

  <p>There was nothing else in the artificial lake apart from the dusky object.</p>

  <p>Was this the key to the reversal of gravitational force?</p>

  <p>Teigan leaned against the wall. He was impatient because he obtained a lot of strength source during this trip. In this case, being ranked first in this coming-of-age ceremony would be very easy.</p>

  <p>The key was to survive, otherwise this whole expedition would prove useless.</p>

  <p>He faintly smiled when he saw Luo Zheng deep in thought to find a way out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a very determined mind-set, who never seemed to be discouraged by any kind of challenges.</p>

  <p>"It's useless. The terrain here is not that tough, and we didn't see any forks along the way. We will have to jump down. If there's no other way, then let's jump down and try our luck!" Even though Teigan uttered these words, he knew clearly that if he jumped into that bottomless abyss, there might not be any way out. They would be trapped in forever.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't respond to Teigan's words and instead walked towards the artificial lake.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Teigan exclaimed. At the center of this artificial lake revolved that hazy thing. He couldn't understand what it was, since nobody at the Collapsing Mountain race had mentioned it. Probably even the prophet didn't know what it was.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the strength source of this Sacred Spring Mountain had fed quite a few terrifying creatures. An advice for the Collapsing Mountain members when they entered the mountain would be not to provoke any of these strange beasts!</p>

  <p>"You will surely die if you go down!" Even though he said this, Teigan followed Zheng's suit. He did not want to be left behind. At least Luo Zheng would be around to face the challenges ahead!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored Teigan's words and moved ahead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng believed in finding the best opportunity to find a path. Even if the path was risky, he would face it. That was Zheng's way of doing things.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng closed his eyes for a moment and jumped into the artificial lake.</p>

  <p>Since the lake was not very deep, he could walk towards the grey object.</p>

  <p>As he got closer, he could make out the object clearly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng soon realized that the circling object was in fact just a lot of thin smoke. As it kept drifting continuously, it gave an illusion of a circular object.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in the middle of the smoke, Luo Zheng could make out an Eight-diagram Ball!</p>

  <p>By now, Teigan had also jumped into the lake and was wading towards Luo Zheng. He just could not stand helplessly by the shore. Teigan was relieved to see that the object did not attack Luo Zheng as he got closer. He feverishly hoped that the object was their key to escape.</p>

  <p>Teigan just couldn't think of any other way through which they could leave this place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cautiously stepped towards the Eight-diagram Ball. He was very careful of the movements he made.</p>

  <p>He had to be careful and was on the lookout for any kind of traps placed around the ball. If he got trapped, then there would be limited chances to fight back.</p>

  <p>100 feet...</p>

  <p>50 feet...</p>

  <p>30 feet...</p>

  <p>10 feet...</p>

  <p>And finally, Luo Zheng walked into the gray mist.</p>

  <p>Before he entered, Luo Zheng held his breath. He did not trust the nature of the smoke. What if it was laden with some sort of poison?</p>

  <p>'OK. This feels safe! I can move forward!" Luo Zheng felt more optimistic.</p>

  <p>Perhaps his guess was right, and the object should be related to the reversal of attraction force!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grasped the Eight-diagram Ball and snatched it away from its place.</p>

  <p>The ball felt very cool in his hands and was smooth and heavy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the Eight-diagram Ball in one hand and examined it carefully.</p>

  <p>There were two colored holes on it, black and white. Cracks were formed along the lines of the eight-diagram pattern in the center of the sphere.</p>

  <p>After turning the ball many times in his hand and carefully scrutinizing it, he still remained clueless about the ball's mystery.</p>

  <p>He tried to use his blood to make the ball recognize him as its master, and then used his own mental power to immerse himself in the Eight-diagram Ball, but the ball remained still.</p>

  <p>After trying these methods, he grabbed the top and twisted it to the right.</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>With that sound, the black and white holes flipped down and the ball opened.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, there was a rumble, and Luo Zheng saw the strength source of the lake above his head directly toppling down towards him!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Teigan also reached the dusky mist and was about to warn Luo Zheng not to touch the object. If Luo Zheng wasn't careful enough and triggered some mechanism, they would die there.</p>

  <p>But before he could say anything, Luo Zheng had already opened it.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>If a bowl of water was poured, it would cause ripple and commotion.</p>

  <p>Imagine what the entire strength source of the lake could create!</p>

  <p>After the attraction force was reversed, the strength source descended from the artificial lake above their heads to the artificial lake below, immediately dousing Luo Zheng and Teigan.</p>

  <p>Teigan was speechless at this sight. So this was it! This was the whole strength source of the lake! Was it really that easy to get it?</p>

  <p>The strength source kept pouring continuously in the artificial lake below. After a long time, Luo Zheng and Teigan finally floated up from the bottom of the lake.</p>

  <p>"I... I will absorb all the strength source now! Ha-ha!" Teigan was ecstatic after seeing this! By absorbing a small amount of the strength source, he might become the future leader of the Collapsing Mountain race. Imagine his powers if he could absorb the entire strength source!</p>

  <p>Earlier, Teigan had doubts about becoming powerful, but now he could brush those thoughts aside.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, he knew that he could absorb only a limited portion of the strength source.</p>

  <p>Although Teigan was physically stronger than the warriors of other races, there was still a limit. If he absorbed the entire strength source, his physical body would soon reach its saturation point.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Luo Zheng was quietly floating on the lake, advancing ahead.</p>

  <p>His thirst for strength was many times greater than that of Teigan. His capacity to absorb the maximum amount of strength was also higher.</p>

  <p>Soon, he was completely focused on devouring the entire strength source!</p>
