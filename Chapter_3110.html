<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3110 Rushing Out Of The Encirclement </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The three winged women flew over slowly with unusually sweet smiles plastered on their faces.</p>

  <p>The woman that led them was naked, covered only by dazzling golden light. If not for a pair of wings that were each more than 100 feet wide, she would be an extraordinary beauty.</p>

  <p>"Your trip has ended," she said.</p>

  <p>Her voice was like silk, sweet and mesmerizing.</p>

  <p>Satchel stood midair. He managed to maintain a calm composure despite his surprise. "I didn't expect that powerful nonhuman creatures from the Divine Lair like you would come this time."</p>

  <p>"Surprised?" the woman smiled, not giving anything away.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Under normal circumstances, you wouldn't give notice to a single Shade Stone, right? Master Elizabeth even used her Illusory Projection to destroy the Arrays of Innumerable Swords from thousands of miles away. May I ask why?" Satchel asked.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace had the ability to fight against the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>The Mountain Viewing Province, which was not very important to them, only saw the Grand River Fortress erected to guard the place and train the Oneness Guards simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Although the Shade Stone had immeasurable value, it wasn't enough to seriously interest the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>"The Shade Stone is one of a kind. We will stop at nothing to acquire it," the woman replied with a smile. "I don't want to kill all these people. Hand over the Shade Stone, and I'll let you leave."</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a surge of anxiety upon hearing her words.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was to survive and return to the Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even if the Shade Stone could be sent to the Grand River Fortress, it had nothing to do with the Oneness Guards and soldiers at the bottom of society.</p>

  <p>At most, they would get some merit points.</p>

  <p>If they didn't hand over the Shade Stone, their lives would likely end here.</p>

  <p>Satchel, however, merely returned a smile and replied, "You know it's futile to request such a thing. When we accept a task, we either complete it or die trying."</p>

  <p>"Ah, so it's okay for these people to die with you?" the woman asked.</p>

  <p>Whispers spread among the soldiers and some Oneness Guards. Even the most loyal soldiers would think for themselves if they were driven to a dead end and had their lives on the line.</p>

  <p>Satchel tried to maintain his composure as he felt a frown creep up on his face. This woman truly was cunning. She had turned the crowd's morale upside down just like that.</p>

  <p>For now, he couldn't think of a better response than to ignore her. He turned, and with a booming voice, gave out an order. "Sebert, escort Master Cailen away. Other Oneness Guards are to make a sword array. These demonic women are not of the same race as us and will never let us go!"</p>

  <p>With the order set in place, there was neither a room for maneuver nor surrender.</p>

  <p>A cold smile was plastered across the woman's face as she said, "Well then, we have nothing to say. Bella, Mary, you two go take the Shade Stone."</p>

  <p>The moment she gave out the order, the other two women's auras soared.</p>

  <p>Satchel knew there was no room for hesitation. He immediately waved his hand, and with a flash of lightning, a huge sword materialized in front of him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sebert escorted Cailen to flee from the side. It was too late, however, as the women blocked their way before they could rush out of their encirclement.</p>

  <p>The scattering Sun Crows rushed towards the group once more. Countless red shadows flew up in the Falling Fox Ridge as the number of the Blood Sun Crows multiplied more than ten times.</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart sank at the sight of the battle.</p>

  <p>Although the Oneness Guards followed Satchel's order to form a sword array, they knew there was little chance of survival.</p>

  <p>As Satchel just instructed the Oneness Guards, Maxim turned to Rupert and the others. "Try to rush out of the encirclement and run as far as you can.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race isn't aiming at you, so I don't think they will kill you."</p>

  <p>The other Oneness Guards also ordered their subordinates similarly.</p>

  <p>These people came all the way to guard the Blue Cloud City. Now that it had been abandoned, they no longer had a duty.</p>

  <p>Gant was worried about Eira. As he saw a woman chase after his father, he rushed out without much thought.</p>

  <p>Golden lights shot towards him before he could even go further.</p>

  <p>Gant took a deep breath before somersaulting. Despite this, the much more flexible Sharp-winged Sun Crows' attacks were unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Just then, he sensed a cold light behind him. There appeared Zheng, who had killed all the Sharp-winged Sun Crows with his long sword. Zheng looked at Gant intently and shouted, "Follow me!"</p>

  <p>The two of them rushed out of the crowd and headed south.</p>

  <p>The others ran towards either the west, the east, or the Blue Cloud City where there were less Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Those who saw Gant and Zheng heading south wondered why. Powerful nonhuman creatures and many Blood Sun Crows crowded inside the Falling Fox Ridge. Going there would mean a greater chance of getting killed.</p>

  <p>But most of the Blood Sun Crows were attacking the Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Gant were only surrounded by a few Blood Sun Crows, as most of them didn't bother to pay them much attention.</p>

  <p>Quack! Quack! Quack!</p>

  <p>About eight Blood Sun Crows spread their wings and pounced on Zheng.</p>

  <p>For them, these two humans who had just reached the Other Shore Realm were weak, easily killable targets.</p>

  <p>Just as they were still about eighty feet away from him, Zheng looked up as his right eye flashed red.</p>

  <p>By now, even demons that weren't smart enough would feel fear begin to sink in.</p>

  <p>The Blood Sun Crows scrambled into a panic. By then, Zheng had already thrust out his sword.</p>

  <p>"The Six Annihilation Strike!"</p>

  <p>From his sword blade shot out a ray of arc-shaped sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Zheng's calculation was accurate. The sword radiance struck the Blood Sun Crows' heads, which exploded near instantaneously.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The Six Annihilation Strike had completely destroyed not only the Blood Sun Crows' heads but also their souls.</p>

  <p>The dazzling light and sudden horrifying momentum were enough to catch the Oneness Guards' attention from a distance. They all looked at Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>They could only wonder for so long, however, as Blood Sun Crows continued to ambush them.</p>

  <p>After killing several more, Zheng and Gant successfully scared off the Blood Sun Crows. The two rushed out of the encirclement seamlessly as their previous attackers scurried away in fright.</p>

  <p>The moment they flew into the mountain, they heard a terrifying explosion.</p>

  <p>Up in the sky was a golden flame. As it descended, mountains and their trees and rocks were burned off. As the heat waves came closer to the ground, many people's faces heated up.</p>

  <p>"Over there!"</p>

  <p>Sebert and a woman with wings battled in the sky.</p>

  <p>At the same time, another woman chased after Cailen and the weapon refiners.</p>
