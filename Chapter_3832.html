  <p>
</p>

  <p>The room the Eye Spirit went in was a little far away from the one the spider spirit went in, as two rooms of hexagram arrays lay in between them.</p>

  <p>This meant that the Eye Spirit was much stronger than the spider spirit.</p>

  <p>However, such long distance of superiority was easily surpassed by Zheng in less than half a minute.</p>

  <p>"He really surpassed him!"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen anyone who reached this level! He actually surpassed the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>"But isn't the Eye Spirit already in the center of the innermost circle? If he surpassed the Eye Spirit, then will he have the chance to fuse with a bloodline?"</p>

  <p>In everyone's mind, the Eye Spirit was the pinnacle of strength, the symbol of the final destination.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, the Eye Spirit's position remained unshakeable.</p>

  <p>Everyone thought that there might be a select few who could also reach the same destination but never surpass it.</p>

  <p>Yet now, Zheng easily went past this pinnacle. That one step forward meant a lot to these Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"There's still a hexagram array ahead but I can't see if there's also a room. It might just be covered up by darkness..."</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to jump in and out of the scroll painting. He did not have the luxury to observe and could only step onto the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>In the center of the huge vortex was a mass of black substance.</p>

  <p>This eldritch mass had already been repeatedly analyzed by numerous Other Shore creatures. Some believed it to be a form of Void Sand while others thought it was a passage.</p>

  <p>Nobody ever had the chance to verify these assumptions because none of them had ever been able to surpass the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>There were also a lot of arguments about the substance. Since the Eye Spirit stopped just before he reached it, people began to think that it was because he couldn't resist the Void Sand or that he did not dare approach it because he too did not know what it was.</p>

  <p>Today, they finally had a chance to figure out just what this black mass was.</p>

  <p>In a corner of the Grand Plain Stage, a half-human, half-bull creature sat on the bronze ground, his big eyes transfixed on the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>This creature had made a bold guess: that the position of the Eye Spirit was not the destination and that the center of the huge vortex was, in fact, somewhere else.</p>

  <p>Most of the Other Shore creatures he knew viewed his conjecture as a joke.</p>

  <p>This half-human, half-bull creature did not even have the strength to enter the vortex, so what right did he have to assume what lay within that black mass?</p>

  <p>As Zheng stepped onto the hexagram array just at the edge of the black mass, his figure disappeared.</p>

  <p>"A passage!" the half-human, half-bull creature exclaimed. "It's a passage! I was right!"</p>

  <p>He could've very well jumped in joy but, unfortunately, there was nobody he could share his discovery with since the area he was in was deserted.</p>

  <p>"Did he just...disappear?" the Other Shore creatures whispered amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"Was he absorbed by the black substance?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he was transmitted away?"</p>

  <p>There was no blazing light on the Eternal Scroll Painting when Zheng stepped onto the hexagram array. He just simply disappeared; one moment he was there and the next he wasn't.</p>

  <p>It was quiet all throughout the Grand Plain Stage as everyone tried to come up with a reason for Zheng's sudden disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the Grand Plain Stage, a ball floated somewhere. Inside this ball was none other than Claire of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>She was not in the form of a woman nor was there any expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Claire took a good, long look at the Eternal Scroll Painting. "I wonder what the consequences will be..." she muttered under her breath.</p>

  <p>Another woman appeared in a blood-red ball in a different area of the Grand Plain Stage. It was Samantha of the Nihility race. The Grandmaster of Heaven had already left with the Evil God and she was tasked to stay and record what Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"Things seem to be in accordance with the master's guesses," she said with a cautious look on her face. There was a blood-red gem in her hand which recorded all the scenes that had taken place within the Eternal Scroll Painting. Through this gem, the Grandmaster of Heaven would be informed of all the important happenings.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace once again grew nervous since they couldn't confirm Zheng's condition. "Go and see how Zheng's corporeal body looks like," Pearce ordered Athemar.</p>

  <p>Zheng's true body remained in the Oneness Sky Palace but the one on the Other Shore had disappeared. Even Pearce could not understand the consequences of this event.</p>

  <p>Athemar did as he was ordered and withdrew from the Other Shore. Twenty seconds later, he returned and breathed a sigh of relief. "Zheng's corporeal body is safe."</p>

  <p>Pearce nodded in understanding. "I hope he can come out of the Eternal Scroll Painting safely."</p>

  <p>Both Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi remained trapped on the Other Shore. He didn't want Zheng to follow in their footsteps.</p>

  <p>The other Souls of Light remained silent and the atmosphere around them grew frosty. Everyone's heart was naturally filled with worry.</p>

  <p>"You're worrying too much, Elder Pearce. Zheng's never let us down,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said.</p>

  <p>His words eased the atmosphere just a bit. Auden and the others let out a chuckle as they echoed Athemar's sentiments. "That's true! He's never let us down."</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes...</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A sudden ray of blazing light flashed from within the Eternal Scroll Painting. It shot down and smashed onto a Three Purities Stone on the bronze ground. Soon enough, the member of the Jade Crown race with a rather big build emerged.</p>

  <p>He was the one who entered the huge vortex after the one from the Life race. He had seven imprints and managed to enter the ninth circle of the vortex. His other race members couldn't help but look at him in awe since the bloodline of the ninth circle was no doubt enough to make him a backbone of their race.</p>

  <p>Following his return, rays of blazing light would continue to smash down onto the bronze ground, accompanied with a cheer from the respective Other Shore race that received them.</p>

  <p>"Bang..."</p>

  <p>Kirk, Egan, and a talent of the Grasshopper race were the last to arrive. The last one managed to enter an inner circle.</p>

  <p>Save for the member of the Life race who died and Zheng who mysteriously disappeared, everyone managed to return safely.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace craned their necks in an effort to see if Zheng made it.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just them. The Three Eyes race, the Swallow Victory race, and even the other neutral races were also concerned about the situation. Since Zheng supported the Finale Way and had shown his potential by surpassing the Eye Spirit, they all hoped he would be able to come back alive.</p>

  <p>However, there were quite a number of those who hoped for the opposite.</p>

  <p>Those affiliated with the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race, such as the Violet Cloud race, hoped for Zheng's death. There was no way they could stomach the rise of another force.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to wait! That guy has no doubt been eroded to dust by the Void Sand."</p>

  <p>"It's been so long. There's no way he's coming back!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>The ridicule from the Violet Cloud race was truly too much!</p>

  <p>Libby wanted to refute them and say something equally scathing, but Pearce stopped her. Arguing with them was useless in this situation.</p>

  <p>They continued to wait for an hour more before the black mass within the Eternal Scroll Painting fully dissipated.</p>

  <p>The huge vortex and the Other Shore creatures' pictures disappeared, which signaled the closing of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>
