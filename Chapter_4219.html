<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4219 The Backstage Manipulator </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Faint green flames were now dancing on the edges of the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>They were faint, but highly viscous, like a thick liquid, slowly climbing around the sword, and then onto Luo Zheng's arms. Finally, they formed a green head.</p>

  <p>The head looked horrendous, as if a ghost had crawled out of the depths of hell. It had huge horns and breathed fire.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the head opened its mouth, green flames whooshed out instead of breath, and ignited the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was looking at the Snake Spirit King through the green flames. He suddenly remarked, "It is theoretically impossible to get around the Probability Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>I can only see one way of ending this fight. And that is no way! This fight will remain a stalemate, because we can't kill an opponent with infinite speed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, maintaining the Probability Extreme Form requires extreme amounts of energy. I can exhaust you little by little as the fight progresses, but I have a better choice."</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng finished speaking, he disappeared.</p>

  <p>And then he reappeared immediately.</p>

  <p>Using the infinite speed, space and distance were meaningless to him.</p>

  <p>Even though there was quite a bit of distance between him and the Snake Spirit King, it could be said that they were overlapping.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword slashed down on the Snake Spirit King's head.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King also disappeared rapidly. Luo Zheng's attack did not succeed. Both sides possessed almost equal speed.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Although I don't know what use those flames have, no matter how powerful they are, they can't burn me. You..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King couldn't finish his words. He was shocked at what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>A giant hole, several hundred feet in diameter had appeared in the black cloud.</p>

  <p>The green flames had actually burnt through a portion of the black cloud.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng reappeared, turned around, and looked at the Snake Spirit King with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Although the Probability Extreme Form is powerful, there is still a way to restrain it.</p>

  <p>And that is to utilize...</p>

  <p>The Flame Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword was not exactly a living being. Basically, it could only communicate through emotions, and what it felt or made you feel was beyond words.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had obtained the ability to understand what it was trying to say.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began to wave his irregular heavy sword in the black cloud.</p>

  <p>The green flames were beginning to spread everywhere now.</p>

  <p>The black cloud was hanging over them like a huge curtain. But the flames seemed to know what they were doing. In a few seconds, a large area of the cloud was burn out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was moving incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>He could summon nine hundred and ninety-nine avatars and whip thousands of sword strikes in a flash.</p>

  <p>Together, the flames were devouring the cloud like a hungry lion. The hole was now hundreds of thousands of feet long and wide.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the Snake Spirit King roared hysterically.</p>

  <p>In desperation, he pounced on Luo Zheng once again, trying to stop the man from burning down the black cloud.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of speed, Luo Zheng was easily on par with the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>As long as he maintained the Probability Extreme Form and kept dodging, the Snake Spirit King would be unable to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>With flames flowing all around it, the irregular heavy sword in Luo Zheng's hand turned into a burning stick. The flames were now rising up like a dragon.</p>

  <p>A giant hole began to spread out from the center of the black cloud and was expanding surprisingly fast.</p>

  <p>About five minutes later, it had already spread across two thirds of the area of the black cloud. Two more minutes and the black cloud which had been four hundred square miles in area had disappeared almost completely. Only a few fragments of it remained.</p>

  <p>Even though the fragments were not connected to each other, the Snake Spirit King still had the ability to crawl within them.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.</p>

  <p>The worst part was that there was no point in being anxious.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, only a small fragment about ten feet long was left, and the Snake Spirit King was trapped on it.</p>

  <p>By that time, Luo Zheng had already left the black cloud, and the people on the altar could see him.</p>

  <p>"Why has only Luo Zheng appeared? "</p>

  <p>"Where is the Snake Spirit King?"</p>

  <p>"What does he want to do?"</p>

  <p>"Wait... Can you see those flames on the sword? They are so strange.</p>

  <p>They flow like liquid and it's almost as if they're sentient."</p>

  <p>The audience watched Luo Zheng float in one direction and wave the irregular heavy sword around him.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Another whip of the sword and the green flames burned the last fragment of the black cloud where the Snake Spirit King was hiding.</p>

  <p>He was forced to stumble out.</p>

  <p>"Hiss!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King spat out his tongue. He looked furious at being humiliated like that.</p>

  <p>The two black blades on him suddenly morphed into a string of black flowers and chopped at Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>However, without the black cloud, the Probability Extreme Form had become useless, and the Snake Spirit King's speed had returned back to normal.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blocked his attack as if he were confronting a child.</p>

  <p>And not only that, every time Luo Zheng blocked the blades, green flames would spread from his sword to the blades and engulf them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was too focused on his attacks. Therefore, when he finished, unaware to him, the green flames had already spread all over his body.</p>

  <p>The interesting thing was that the flames released by the Flame Extreme Form did not cause any burning physical pain; or at least the Snake Spirit King could not feel it. Therefore, he did not realize that he was wrapped in those flames until after he had stepped back and taken a look at himself.</p>

  <p>And then he saw that Luo Zheng was standing far away from him with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!"</p>

  <p>Just as the Snake Spirit King was about to rush forward again, the green flames suddenly exploded like fireworks. They burned every single part of his body.</p>

  <p>The flames did not have any heat, but they still possessed an astonishing amount of destructive power.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's body was being burned bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It was as if his body had been laced with kerosene. As the flames continued to burn and spread, he began to collapse and shrink.</p>

  <p>In less than half a minute, he had been burnt to a crisp, black death.</p>

  <p>Up until now, only two ways of killing Treacherous Beings were known on the Other Shore. The first one was to be killed by the Light of Annihilation, and the second was to be completely eroded by the Void Dust. The Snake Spirit King, however, had faced his demise in a way that had never been witnessed before by anyone in any part of the world.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit King has been defeated once again!"</p>

  <p>"Not just defeated! He was burnt to death!"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? How can Luo Zheng's flames burn him down like that?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, every single Treacherous Being present there, including the Snake Masters, the snake spirits, the Bird Masters, and the Monkey Masters felt a chill run down their spines. Was it really as easy to kill them now?</p>

  <p>After all, they were all supposed to be immortal. However, if one more way of killing them had just been discovered, it meant crisis!</p>

  <p>"Is it over?" someone piped up.</p>

  <p>"No, not yet. The Snake Spirit King's coordinates are still there." Came the answer.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes turned towards the sky once again.</p>

  <p>The black coordinates of the Snake Spirit King were still fixed there.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed and he whooshed into the sky, holding the irregular heavy sword and slashing at the black coordinates without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Luckily, this wasn't supposed to be hard. Without the protection of the ball, the black coordinates couldn't resist Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>However, just as the man brandished his sword, a ball of black light suddenly emerged from the coordinates. It spread out like a black hole, and at the same time, a black fist stretched out from it, slamming into the irregular heavy sword with a furious metallic clang.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt an irresistible force coming from the irregular heavy sword, and then he was sent flying backwards at an incredible speed. He had been thrown backwards so forcefully that he couldn't even guess how fast he was flying.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Recovering, Luo Zheng began using spatial transference. He traveled around back and forth within a distance of two hundred feet, trying to lose the attacker. He didn't stop until he had moved at least a hundred times.</p>

  <p>He was not surprised at the sudden appearance of the fist, though. He looked at the black hole calmly and then said, "You gave the Snake Spirit King his power. Are you the evil backstage manipulator that ruined the Four Spirits Sect?"</p>
