  <p>
</p>

  <p>Surrounded by three other sects' stones, the Flow Sword Sect knew they were in grave danger of being knocked out soon.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes darted from the helpless disciples to the giant rock Feng Ge was controlling as she watched on her own. She sighed in frustration, knowing she couldn't do anything to help.</p>

  <p>If Feng Ge weren't there, she might have been able to persuade Jermain to help the Flow Sword Sect out. But Feng Ge was aggressively attacking their rock; those from the Origin Mountain had been too preoccupied.</p>

  <p>Among the chaos, Dorothy still focused most of her attention on Zheng.</p>

  <p>She felt a small surge of hope as she recalled how Zheng had miraculously managed to solve the Flow Sword Sect's crisis some moments earlier.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps the situation isn't so bad?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Zheng had recited over ten words and a cyclone had appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>He was standing on top of the two runes, continuously emanating his truth aura.</p>

  <p>The cyclone began to swirl more violently as it started to change his truth aura.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The controlling rune beneath his left foot and the accelerating rune beneath his right began to shine a bright yellow light. Suddenly, the patterns on the rock glowed the same bright yellow.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Zheng whispered, slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>When he first set foot on the controlling rune, he had noticed that it was almost the same as the Imperial Sword Seal. As long as he released his truth aura, the rune would absorb it all.</p>

  <p>When he had summoned the cyclone, the two runes he stood upon suddenly began to absorb the truth aura more quickly!</p>

  <p>On top of the cave, Athemar suddenly stood up urgently from his seat when he saw what Zheng was doing— he barely even flinched when he knocked over a cup of hot tea. He trained his eyes on the runes beneath Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Goran, Winchell and the old man responsible for distributing the flags were surprised at his reaction. Following Athemar's gaze, they too noticed the strange bright yellow light emanating from Zheng's runes and the big rock.</p>

  <p>The weight runes and the rules were designed by Goran. As for the three runes on the giant rocks, they were made by Athemar himself.</p>

  <p>This game was not one to test combat skills or mere strength— otherwise, it might as well have been a martial arts contest. This was a game of teamwork. They were testing the camaraderie among these elite disciples.</p>

  <p>The three runes set by Athemar were actually variants of the Imperial Sword Seal. They were meant to bring the elite disciples' strength up to the same level.</p>

  <p>Of course, the disciples capable of Instant Enlightenment still had a great advantage over the others.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Athemar suddenly sensed something strange through the Imperial Sword Seal!</p>

  <p>"What happened, Athemar?" the old man asked, curious as to why Athemar was acting strangely.</p>

  <p>With an incredulous look on his face, Athemar stared at Zheng. "Zheng's Truth of Eternal Sword Intent..." he said slowly, "Something is wrong with it!"</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong? Are you sure?" the old man asked with a calm smile.</p>

  <p>All the swordsmen in this world cultivated the same Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>No matter they were in the chaos or in the Source World, they all had the exactly same version.</p>

  <p>Even the best supreme swordsmanship manuals might have some flaws in them. However, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent could never have anything "wrong", and nor would any other Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Truths of Godly Ways were known to be the established ways to wield strength. Everyone had to learn them step by step; there was never a shortcut.</p>

  <p>That was why Goran and the rest were confused with Athemar's words.</p>

  <p>Before they could discuss any further, the huge rock that Zheng was standing upon suddenly began to float upwards.</p>

  <p>Due to the weight of the huge rocks, even if the disciples were able to work in unison, it would still be considerably difficult to control them.</p>

  <p>And yet, Zheng was able to control this giant rock with ease— as though it were as light as a feather!</p>

  <p>As the giant rock floated higher and higher, the disciples of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect all paused to watch it in shock. Time seemed to slow down. One question hung in the air: how did he do it?</p>

  <p>Before they could even begin to try to figure it out, the giant rock that was hovering above them suddenly plummeted towards their rocks.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The sheer weight of the massive rock, coupled with its momentum as it shot down from the sky caused the earth to tremor upon impact.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect had no chance to dodge at all. Their rocks were crushed by Zheng's rock, one after another.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Before anyone could react, the giant rocks of the two sects had been knocked down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Even though Hare had ordered a disciple of the Killing Sword Sect to activate the enchanted barrier on the giant rock at the last moment, it was to no avail. The barrier fell apart like a tower of cards under the great pressure of Zheng's rock.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of the two sects fell from the rocks and rolled on the ground. Looking up, Hare and his companions saw the Flow Sword Sect's members floating in the air.</p>

  <p>"They... They must have cheated!"</p>

  <p>"How could the rock move so flexibly?! And how could it generate such a strong impact?!"</p>

  <p>"But no tricks could be played on the huge rocks..."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they used a special Other Shore Token!"</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore Tokens had abilities so strange and unexpected that no one knew how to defend themselves against them. However, using such Other Shore Tokens was against the rules!</p>

  <p>In fact, when Konnor used his Other Shore Token to raise their rock from the ground, he had violated the rules already. However, Tacy and others hadn't pointed it out; they considered it a loophole.</p>

  <p>When Hare heard this conjecture, he immediately jumped up from the ground and shouted at Tacy on the metal mountain, "They cheated! The Flow Sword Sect cheated! We must be given another chance!"</p>

  <p>Tacy and the others from the Land of Sword Grief also felt bewildered at the turn of events. They didn't expect that the remaining seven of the Flow Sword Sect could control the giant rock so dexterously and move in such an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"I heard that there is an Other Shore Token of mysterious type that can make things ethereal and reduce weight," a tall man next to Tacy said.</p>

  <p>"If the giant rock was rendered ethereal, it would not have generated so strong impact force. They might have used some other methods," another man commented.</p>

  <p>Tacy couldn't figure out what the truth was, so she looked up towards the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>She knew that Goran and the rest had been watching the game from above.</p>

  <p>If someone had cheated, she knew they would know.</p>

  <p>As soon as she looked up, she heard Goran's calm voice echoing in her ear,</p>

  <p>"No one cheated. Let them continue."</p>

  <p>Tacy nodded and made a gesture of "No" to Hare and the rest. "They didn't cheat. You were knocked out, fair and square."</p>

  <p>"Then how will you explain their incredible speed?" Hare said, with suspicion on his face.</p>

  <p>"I agree! That's not normal at all!"</p>

  <p>"Even a disciple capable of Instant Enlightenment can't make it! We strongly demand the game to start again!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the two sects couldn't accept the fact that they had been kicked out of the game by Zheng in an instant. Some of them even walked towards the giant rocks on the ground. They really wanted to return to the game.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Tacy's eyes narrowed slightly. As she crossed her thumb and her little finger, countless invisible threads immediately appeared around those disciples.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, these disciples were tied firmly with threads and were yanked and dragged onto the metal mountain, till they hung upside down in front of Tacy.</p>

  <p>"How dare you question my announcement? All of you, get out of here now!" Tacy spat angrily as she spoke. With a flick of her finger, she tossed the disciples onto the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>All people who had entered the Land of Sword Grief obviously had a very bad temper.</p>

  <p>When the other eliminated disciples saw this, they didn't dare to argue anymore and could only retreat dejectedly to the edge of the cave to join those who had already been kicked out of the game.</p>
