<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the voice rang throughout the area, Han Liusu and the others temporarily froze in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Here comes Harold again! He appears every time when the clans' Floating Islands are about to be ranked," Quentin chuckled.</p>

  <p>"That's true. He really worked hard to keep the Luo Clan's Floating Island above the Time Sea," agreed a genius from another clan.</p>

  <p>"It is said that he has completely controlled the Everest Spirit Mountain, and his skills have probably improved so much--which is bad for Rachelle Mu. Actually, it can be considered as Rachelle paying off the debt for the Mu Clan."</p>

  <p>It was known that the ranking of the Floating Islands had changed multiple times in the past few years.</p>

  <p>Most of the members of the Luo Clan had died, while the few remaining ones left and hid away in the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Yet over the years, the Luo Clan's Floating Island never fell into the Time Sea. It still even remained in the third-lowest place among all the wealthy clans, and it was all because of Harold.</p>

  <p>Back then when he had left the Time Sea, he had taken away a piece of the Jade Wall of Legends. Then every time the Floating Islands were ranked again, he continuously challenged a few consummate True Gods, and thus obtained enough points to protect the Luo Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>In addition, every time the first person he chose was Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Back then, it wasn't just the Mu Clan that had destroyed the Luo Clan-- the Hall of Holy Beings had also gotten involved. However, Murphy Mu was at the helm, and he was the one who subsequently launched a war in the Evolutionary Universe. Of course, Harold had released his anger on the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>The True Gods went into thousands of battles in the Arena of Legends every day, but what garnered the most attention were the battles between the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods could have tens of thousands, or even millions of points at a time. The results of their battles determined the ranking of their Floating Islands, and that was one of the reasons why the Holy Beings gave so much importance to cultivating their own disciples.</p>

  <p>While the chances of disciples becoming Holy Beings were very small, they still played an important role.</p>

  <p>Now, the battles between the consummate True Gods were usually open battles. Everyone from the Floating Islands could come to the battle site and watch. Warriors had to pay according to their own cultivation level to watch, as the low-rank True Gods needed to pay forty points, mid-rank True Gods needed to pay two hundred points, and top-rank True Gods had to pay six hundred points.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods all had reached the consummation of some kind of Godly Way, and they often had good comprehensions and strong theurgies beyond way. These True Gods could comprehend a lot from watching the battles, so they would gladly pay to spectate the fights.</p>

  <p>Therefore, numerous True Gods had used their points to pay to watch the open battle after the announcement today.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng had been quite relaxed the past few days. During that period, he spent his time thinking about the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>The last time he fought against Moore, he learned that strength was not an all-around power in the divine land. It was known that Moore wasn't really an outstanding warrior and was only a little stronger than Sheridan. However, he didn't get to figure out a way around Moore's strange skills.</p>

  <p>Moore had employed many weird techniques, especially the Snow Divine Spear activated by the frost marks. Its power had far surpassed the limit of a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the Snow Godly Way wasn't focused on such kinds of attacks, so he assumed that it must've been combined with the theurgies beyond some other special Divine Dao. If he could've activated the Infinity Ruler at that time, he would've had the confidence to see through the skill's origins and formulate counterattacks. He might even be able to make that powerful method his own.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was difficult to survive from that kind of situation, let alone absorb such a kind of theurgy.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler remained silent in Luo Zheng's mind. During this time, Master Evil was afraid that Joy would know about his existence, so he sealed himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had used many methods to activate the Infinity Ruler when it had been stored in his mind. For instance, he had used his own soul to envelop it and injected his own spiritual sense into the Infinity Ruler. He had even led a trace of chaotic energy into his mind, but the jade Infinity Ruler still did not have any reaction.</p>

  <p>'The key to activating the Infinity Ruler is in the internal momentum. All kinds of internal momentum of Godly Way, even the internal momentum of theurgy beyond way will activate it.' He sank further into his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Every time the Infinity Ruler was activated, it was because he absorbed enough internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"Up until now, the Infinity Ruler has not yet absorbed the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way," he said with a glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>However, he did not intend to bring his Emotion Closing Godly Way into the Infinity Ruler. After all, he mainly cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way, so there was no need to add another Godly Way to the Infinity Ruler. He might be able to absorb all of the Divine Dao into the Infinity Ruler in the future, but now he was not in a hurry.</p>

  <p>After he thought about it for a few more days, an idea suddenly occurred to him. He felt like he'd finally found the answer to his problem.</p>

  <p>'Can the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way activate the Infinity Ruler?</p>

  <p>What if I activate it, and then disperse the internal momentum quickly?'</p>

  <p>It obviously was not a good method but then again, his father didn't teach him how to use the Infinity Ruler. He even didn't know what its real power was, but he thought he could have a try.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he quickly closed his eyes. Then, a faint golden light flashed from his soul.</p>

  <p>"Forget myself!"</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes again, his eyes were as calm as a still river without any emotion in them.</p>

  <p>But now, he was in Joy's palace. Although the Demi-holy Being was trustworthy, he was still reluctant to reveal his forbidden way of cultivation. Thus, he had to restrain his momentum to the maximum.</p>

  <p>At that moment, threads of internal momentum leaked out from his soul and slowly spread across his mind.</p>

  <p>"Did it work?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>He had always kept an eye on the changes to the Infinity Ruler. If he hadn't been in the state of emotion closing, he would've looked as if he was expecting something. However, he was emotionless now. His face was devoid of any joy or sadness.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A ray of light suddenly glowed along the edge of the Infinity Ruler. The light constantly swam around the scales, and then eventually stopped at its end.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way is ranked at the end of the 3000 Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>He knew that every single Godly Way corresponded to a scale on the Infinity Ruler. Furthermore, the position of each Godly Way's scale seemed to have been prescribed, and they weren't arranged in the same order as his absorption of those Divine Dao. Now, the golden light had stopped at the end of the Infinity Ruler, which was where the position of the Emotion Closing Godly Way should be.</p>

  <p>Just then, the scale began to absorb the internal momentum he had released. At the same time, he felt his eyes burn as two golden rings glowed around his pupils.</p>

  <p>"It's done!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>After that, the first thing he did was to absorb back all the internal momentum in his mind.</p>

  <p>He did so because he wanted to activate the Infinity Ruler by the Emotion Closing Godly Way, but he didn't really want to let the Infinity Ruler absorb the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The golden rings in his eyes still shone even after he had retrieved all the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way. The golden rings allowed him to see his surroundings normally, but once he saw other beings' internal momentum of the Divine Dao, he could quickly see through their mystery and absorb them into the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe it. His inadvertent attempt actually worked!</p>

  <p>His face was twisted into ecstasy after he freed himself from the state of emotion closing. Through such a method, he could easily solve many problems he had encountered and be more unrestrained in comprehending the internal momentum used by other True Gods.</p>

  <p>The rings in his eyes lasted for about five minutes before they slowly dimmed.</p>

  <p>The moment the light was gone, Joy's voice slowly cut into the silence.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard the sudden voice, he thought that Joy had noticed what he just did. Nervousness coursed through his body as Joy said, "Harold is going to challenge Rachelle. It's an open battle. You can watch the battle after you enter the Jade Wall of Legends."</p>

  <p>"Harold!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed with raised brows. Harold was the one who had taken away Luo Zheng's sister back in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Back then, he was able to catapult Luo Luo Zheng several hundred miles away with the power of just one finger.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Luo Zheng secretly swore that he would definitely defeat that guy one day.</p>

  <p>He never expected that this young man was his father's chief disciple, Harold Yu!</p>

  <p>"Wasn't the Floating Island of the Luo Clan destroyed? Why could he enter the Arena of Legends to challenge Rachelle?" he asked. He was very confused, but Joy just gave him that one message then kept silent, and did not answer his question.</p>

  <p>In any case, he didn't wait any longer and rushed into the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he reached his destination and paid 40 points to enter a huge world.</p>

  <p>A bloody red setting sun hung at the edge of the world, which seemed to be washed over with blood. It even had a salty, coppery smell as well.</p>

  <p>Although it was a made-up space, everything in it looked absolutely real.</p>

  <p>"So many people..." Luo Luo Zheng whispered helplessly. Everywhere he looked was filled with spectators. He saw countless proving godly warriors, low-rank True Gods, and mid-rank True Gods at a single glance.</p>

  <p>Just when the anonymous man had arrived, all the spectators immediately paid attention to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
