<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Pascal flapped his wings again in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Countless feathers, as sharp as knives, swept toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body jerked roughly in the air, and he let out a muffled groan.</p>

  <p>This time, four feathers had hit him. Three of them grazed his shoulders and legs, and the other one pierced through his chest.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen and Tianming stood not far away. They tensed and clenched their fists when they heard Luo Zheng's pained groan.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng may not be able to hold on like this!" Sword Chen told Tianming through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>It was understandable that Luo Zheng's life mattered so much to them. After all, even though they went to the Mountain of Holy Beings to become Holy Beings, protecting Luo Zheng had always been their priority.</p>

  <p>As Sword Chen finished speaking, he thrust forward to dodge the spears falling from above his head. He brandished his long sword to create a sword net and shrouded Pascal.</p>

  <p>Click... Click... Click...</p>

  <p>His sword net could not destroy Pascal's armor. Pascal didn't even mind him. He just continued going after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your method is useless!"</p>

  <p>Tianming exclaimed in frustration. He closed his eyes and felt what was happening in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"What can we do? This is not the Abyss Demon Region!" Sword Chen said anxiously.</p>

  <p>If he was in the Abyss Demon Region, he could use the force of primitive fear. However, even if Rosie lent all the force of primitive fear to him, it was still impossible to break Pascal's armor.</p>

  <p>"The ice flowers of the girl can't transform the black energy. If it goes on like this, Luo Zheng will die." Tianming was also anxious. They were both worried, but they didn't know what to do next.</p>

  <p>Another muffled sound came from the darkness. Through his spiritual sense, Tianming could tell that blood was bursting out of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"There's no other way. Let's pin Pascal down to buy some time for Luo Zheng," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"No," Tianming refused.</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Sword Chen was stunned. He was surprised that Tianming was not immediately on board with his plan.</p>

  <p>After they came out of the Abyss Demon Region safely, his target, Nicholas, was dead. He also obtained a supreme treasure of belief. He thought that he accomplished his mission. And thus, he could continue his life and live happily with his wife, Iris.</p>

  <p>But now, he saw the danger that Luo Zheng was in, and suddenly, he realized that his mission was not completed. It was just delayed.</p>

  <p>His hand that held the Soaring Snake Sword was trembling slightly.</p>

  <p>Although he kept calm, there were still tiny beads of sweat on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng," he said through his life vitality, "could the Reincarnation Soul Weapon really bring people back to life?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had trouble defending himself from Pascal. He had used all his skills.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had also warned him that he must distance himself from Pascal.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he would be killed despite his strong body.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Soul Weapon can bring you back to life, and you will have your Memory Flame, but you will lose your cultivation. You have to start all over again. Why are you asking this?" Luo Zheng explained while he was fighting. His eyes widened when he guessed what Tianming was planning.</p>

  <p>In turn, Tianming smiled wistfully. "That's good. Please take care of Iris for me. I hope this is not the last time that we say goodbye to each other."</p>

  <p>"What? Don't!" Luo Zheng cried out.</p>

  <p>Just then, Tianming raised his Soaring Snake Sword in the air.</p>

  <p>The blade of the sword began to glow.</p>

  <p>Just a few seconds ago, the valley was completely submerged in darkness.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a ray of luminous sword radiance broke through. It was like a candle that suddenly lit up the night. No matter how tiny it was, it instantly attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"What skill is it?"</p>

  <p>"How could that guy break the darkness?"</p>

  <p>"What a unique aura!"</p>

  <p>Some people that had been running turned their heads. They marveled at the sword light with awed expressions.</p>

  <p>Pascal also slowed down in astonishment. He turned his head too, and he stared at the sword light with widened eyes. "How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>The light extended from the tip of the sword to the hilt and then to Tianming's arm.</p>

  <p>Under the brightness of the light, Tianming's arm and body were petrified.</p>

  <p>The entire divine land had a total of more than three hundred thousand Ten Commandments Slates, over fifty thousand Hundred Commandments Slates, over eight thousand Thousand Commandments Slates, and one Ruling Slate. Although they were independent of each other, they formed a gigantic array which was one of the foundations of the divine land.</p>

  <p>No one could lay a finger on the foundations of the divine land, not the Holy Beings or the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Tianming was an exception. He inherited a part of Chiyou's legacy, which allowed him to devour the slates with the special power given by the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>He had devoured over three hundred slates over the years, and that was his limit. The power of the rules contained in the slates was too much for him to bear.</p>

  <p>Chiyou didn't encourage the use of such power, because the price of releasing the power was one's own life. From the moment he devoured the first slate, he was destined to walk on a path of no return.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the sword light blazed brighter and brighter, it turned into a small sun. It lit up the entire plain with a dazzling light.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake Sword continued to extract Tianming's life energy. His shoulders, chest, neck, and even elixir field had turned into stones.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tianming and the Soaring Snake Sword had changed their positions. The sword seemed to come to life and was full of vitality, while Tianming had sacrificed his life to the sword. His energy was gradually weakening, and he slowly turned into a cold stone statue.</p>

  <p>"Tianming!" Luo Zheng's eyes widened in shock. He called out in alarm, as Tianming died in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was not until this moment that he finally understood why his father insisted on letting Tianming accompany him to the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Mike didn't want Tianming to become a Holy Being. He made such an arrangement because he had predicted a disaster would happen in the mountain.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Tianming, who was now a stone man, brandished the sword with all his strength.</p>

  <p>His joints made a crisp sound, and his right arm was broken. He fell, like a bird with broken wings, out of the sky.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The black ball that had floated above Tianming's head shot out black spears.</p>

  <p>They pierced through his body and made a cracking noise. Then, the black energy quickly annihilated his body.</p>

  <p>The golden light, as bright as the sun, rushed straight toward Pascal.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Pascal's face darkened.</p>

  <p>Although he trusted the power of the Abyss Demon Region very much, the golden light in front of him had broken his limits. It had destroyed the strong darkness that he had cast.</p>

  <p>As he faced the sword attack, he had to let go of Luo Zheng. He needed to go all out to deal with it, or else he could die.</p>
