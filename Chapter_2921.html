<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Four-Spirit Hiding Array cast by Ramzi was able to hide the space fluctuation. However, slight fluctuations occasionally managed to escape from the array.</p>

  <p>Ramzi could only hope that the people on the flying ship were so careless that they wouldn't notice the space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>However, the flying ship paused and then flew towards them. He immediately realized that the warriors aboard had espied the fluctuation.</p>

  <p>"They have sensed it. What should we do?" Ramzi asked.</p>

  <p>"Let's see what their next move is," said Timotheus calmly.</p>

  <p>He also had a bad feeling about what was happening, but he couldn't afford to panic because it would affect others.</p>

  <p>Soon, the flying ship in the distance slowly approached. It flew past the Four-Spirit Hiding Array, almost touching it, and did not stop until it was one hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards jumped down from the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>"Looks like there is no space fluctuation..." One of the Yellow Emperor Guards looked around but did not sense any.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," spoke Clement flatly. "I felt the space fluctuation twice. It must be nearby. They must have used something to hide themselves so that the space fluctuation would seem faint..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly turned around and stared ahead. Just then, he felt another trace of space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>Under the cover of the Four-Spirit Hiding Array, Emily quietly narrowed her eyes and whispered, "They must have noticed it."</p>

  <p>"Where did they come from? I don't even know whether they are allies or enemies... If they are enemies, shall we take action first?" Leopold uttered coldly.</p>

  <p>"They may be the Yellow Emperor Guards or helpers invited by the Yellow Emperor Guards in the divine land. For sure, they must be enemies," Emily responded.</p>

  <p>Hearing Emily's judgment, Lorena blinked her eyes and asked, "How did you arrive at that conclusion?"</p>

  <p>"Ramzi has hidden the space fluctuation very well. If the newcomers were the outsiders who didn't know anything about the divine land, they would probably try their best to break through the divine land immediately. If they failed to break the Heavenly Mirror Shield, they might probably, like us, try to break the space barrier. However, they are actually looking for the space fluctuation. Someone must have told them that we are breaking the space barrier, so they are looking for us!"</p>

  <p>Just as Emily finished speaking, Clement stretched out and gently waved his hand. All at once, the array that Ramzi used for hiding the space barrier was broken. A strong space fluctuation spread out, forming a huge spiral floating up.</p>

  <p>They could not stop digging the space barrier. As long as they stopped, the space barrier could quickly recover. Therefore, Timotheus and the others placed a treasure in the space barrier, letting it dig the space barrier for them.</p>

  <p>"We found it! Wow! This hiding array is ingenious." A sneer appeared on Clement's face.</p>

  <p>Abbas looked around and said, "Looks like they have sensed our arrival and have given up on this place."</p>

  <p>"Master Clement, should we continue searching for those Nine Li Guards?" asked Godfrey.</p>

  <p>Clement thought for a moment and shook his head. "They have been digging here for a long time, so it's not that easy for them to give up. We need to guard this place, and we can continue digging the space barrier.</p>

  <p>Once we break the space barrier, we will be able to enter the divine land before they do."</p>

  <p>Although they had the Trumpet Flying Ship, the divine land was still too large. If the Nine Li Guards hid themselves on purpose, it would be difficult to find them.</p>

  <p>However, it did not occur to Clement and Abbas that the subjects of their discussion did not go far and were instead hiding several hundred feet away...</p>

  <p>The voices of Clement and his companions clearly carried over to the people hiding in the Four-Spirit Hiding Array. It was now evident to them that Clement and his men came here because of them.</p>

  <p>"They are definitely Yellow Emperor Guards," Emily said with certainty.</p>

  <p>"Since they came here for us, it doesn't matter whether they are Yellow Emperor Guards or not. We have the upper hand, thanks to Ramzi's array."</p>

  <p>Timotheus's eyes glinted with murderous intent.</p>

  <p>With these words, Woodruff was filled with excitement. "Yes! Looks like we're going to fight."</p>

  <p>"The strongest among them is the young man with grey hair. I can deal with him," Emily said, staring at Clement. "The rest of you can fight the others."</p>

  <p>Emily was extremely decisive.</p>

  <p>Clement's judgment was correct. They didn't need to look for Timotheus and the others; all they needed to do was to guard the space barrier.</p>

  <p>Emily had also made the decision without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Of course Clement wouldn't have expected that Emily and her team were going to kill them, so he gave the order leisurely, "Abbas, go into the space channel to check the situation. We should make haste to break the space barrier."</p>

  <p>"Understood, Master Clement." Abbas nodded. As he was about to enter the space channel, the light of the Four-Spirit Hiding Array suddenly dimmed, and the aura hidden in it was instantaneously released.</p>

  <p>As soon as Ramzi removed the Four-Spirit Hiding Array, colorful rings shot out from Emily's hand. The rings were interconnected from the largest to the smallest. At the front was an incomparably sharp spike.</p>

  <p>Emily had sensed the young man with grey hair was extraordinary, so she spared no effort in trying to kill him.</p>

  <p>The attack caught the Yellow Emperor Guards off-guard. They did not expect their quarry to be hiding close by all this time. When they felt the sudden raging aura, they were all stunned.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Timotheus, Ramzi, Leopold, the rest of the Nine Li race and the Other Shore Realm warriors of the Snake Goddess race began to attack the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>However, Clement was not an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior. The moment he felt the aura, his eyes emitted a sharp light. He reached out his hand, and with a slight tap, a blood rune shot out into the air.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the blood rune exploded, it turned into a mass of black and red blood that blocked Emily's spike attack.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sharp spike speeding toward Clement immediately got sucked into the blood.</p>

  <p>Then, the sharp spike and the colorful rings behind it weakened, losing their original speed and power. Clement quickly grabbed the weapons.</p>

  <p>Clement easily foiled Emily's attack and defended himself against his enemy. However, the other Yellow Emperor Guards weren't so lucky.</p>

  <p>The moment Timotheus made his appearance, he stealthily sneaked beside one of the Yellow Emperor Guards. In one sharp movement, he twisted his opponent's neck with his large hands.</p>

  <p>By the time the Yellow Emperor Guard realized what happened to him, it was already too late. As Timotheus's hands flashed with a golden light, the half of the Yellow Emperor Guard's body had already turned into dust, and the warrior perished.</p>

  <p>Ramzi, Leopold and the women of the Snake Goddess race joined hands and killed two other Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>After a short time, three Yellow Emperor Guards were killed. The other Yellow Emperor Guards quickly moved away.</p>

  <p>Clement held his ground. His face a portrait of calm, he said sardonically, "I applaud your daring. What a surprise to find out that you've been hiding so close all along."</p>
