<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 865 A Grave Silence (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Maurice boiled with fury as Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have a fighting spirit. He attacked while withdrawing back. No one ever dared to get on his nerves and challenge him. However, these were blows of a dying horse in Maurice's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Losers never concede defeat despite their overthrow as they still fight like a cornered wild-monster. This is a futile battle and you are nothing close to a wild beast but an ant that can be simply suppressed and trampled upon.</p>

  <p>It's of no use putting up a fight."</p>

  <p>Maurice was determined to kill Luo Luo Zheng whom he thought was the primary source of all the pandemonium. As long as Luo Luo Zheng died, the Demon Night would have no connection with human race and would not dare to challenge the ogre race. The enthusiasm of getting rid of Luo Luo Zheng stirred up Maurice's psyche. The aftermath of the Demon Night revenging after eliminating Luo Luo Zheng together with their queen was less of his interest. After all the ogre race didn't fear them.</p>

  <p>There was starlight expelled, and it had been unmistakably clear. This was because of Luo Zheng's punch.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch was more influential and vigorous despite it being underestimated for a mild punch. The dim light emanated hidden force from the punch. In the real sense it was more energetic than it seemed and it was even more powerful than any common cultivation technique.</p>

  <p>"Snap!" Being an ogre, Maurice was full of himself and assumed that he would smash the star radiance of Luo Zheng's fist. His hands were masculine, meaning they had tremendous power, but he didn't recognize that he chewed more than he could ingest. His confidence outweighed his capability. According to him, the potential he bore would be abundant to appease his ego while crushing the star radiance.</p>

  <p>There was a dazzling light that spurted out of Maurice's right hand. This was way far beyond his inferences, since according to him his energy could beat the star radiance. The dazzling light was initiated when the two fighters' fists struck. The forceful energy emitted from Maurice's hand was immensely strong.</p>

  <p>An excruciating intense pain erupted from Maurice's right hand because of the effect of the collision.</p>

  <p>His speed slackened. The fellow he assumed way below him had inflicted pain on his right hand. With confusion written all over his face, he lifted his right hand to check. Blood oozed from his hand and cracks had flared up.</p>

  <p>He howled out recklessly in disbelief. "Ha-ha! How spectacular a mere human war fighter has dared defy me and above all injure me!"</p>

  <p>Elder Mei and Madeline had to safeguard Luo Luo Zheng, who by now was in the arena's edge after withdrawing back. They stood in front of him to protect him. Xun also flashed on Luo Zheng's side. She had the opportunity of striking with her sword but she knew she wouldn't be able to hit Maurice.</p>

  <p>So she withdrew back and stood next to Luo Luo Zheng, remaining as mute as a grave.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod exchanged glances and joined Luo Luo Zheng while standing in front of him.</p>

  <p>"How enchanting! You two human clowns! No one has ever crossed my path so who do you think you are to challenge me? By the look of things, you humans really don't want the seats in the Tower of Sin anymore,"</p>

  <p>Malcom uttered the words while over sixty ogre war lords followed him as he strode into the arena.</p>

  <p>The existence of many ogre war lords surrounding them meant more harm than good. The situation was tricky and troublesome for them since it was so complicated to tackle.</p>

  <p>The tallies and positions separated the high and mighty from the inferior ones. From this perception the ogre war lords considered the humans as buffoons. Their positions gave them the title regarding the humans had only four seats in the Tower of Sin. In depth, three of the four human seat holders ranked lower than a hundred, and the only human seat holder who was considered outshining the three was only ranked ninety-second.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod had envisaged what would happen to them if the ogres took the power and that was why they didn't have second thoughts joining Luo Luo Zheng. They had analyzed the positive and negative sides before deciding to join Luo Luo Zheng. It was not an awful idea.</p>

  <p>Demon Night was on Luo Zheng's side. This gave them a slight hope since the Demon Night wasn't feebler than the ogres. They had been afraid previously because they were in no position to tackle the ogres by themselves. In the Tower of Sin, the ogres were strong but the Demon Night had the capacity to overshadow them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng planted a smirk on his face while glancing at Maurice, who was a stone's throw away. Acting as if all was well he spoke calmly, "Huh! Are human seats handed out by you? Or is there a written policy, that the ogre race is the only one entitled to determine everything in the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>Many races from the Sea God Continent had tried to repress the Tower of Sin. All the efforts had turned out to be futile. Finally they came to an agreement that the Tower of Sin was not entitled to a particular race. That was why so many races could send their talents into the Tower of Sin to cultivate!</p>

  <p>Maurice in a twinkle of an eye signaled the ogre war lords to attack. Luo Zheng's assertions were none of his business. An excellent move called for an advantage on his side. The human war lords and the Demon Night war lords would be torn apart if the ogre war lords rushed forward.</p>

  <p>As he plotted his ambush, a crisp voice rang out, "Yes! The Tower of Sin belongs to all races. No specific race should be entitled to it! By the look of things your motions were wholly based on your own opinion without caring about other seat owners who also are a part and parcel of the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Members of the Demon Night in a dozen gathered at the entrance of the eleventh floor. The highest percentage of them were feminine, but few males whose facial appearance displayed attractiveness were present.</p>

  <p>The sight of war lords of Demon Night made Maurice's face turn dull. This changed his mood and his high spirits.</p>

  <p>According to the ranks, Maurice was the second despite him being considered the high and mighty. The top ranked positions were all seized by the Demon Night, who had a dozen seats in the Tower of Sin. Moreover, they had secured the first place among the one hundred and twenty-eight seats, which meant that the toughest seat holder came from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Esther Ling was the holder of the first seat and the person who spoke just now.</p>

  <p>Esther Ling, with a buoyant attitude, led the war lords of the Demon Night and proceeded towards them. She was confident and had faith in herself.</p>

  <p>She emitted an Mu Ning of tact and poise. Just a moment ago, the Mu Ning emitted from Maurice made many of the creatures on the tenth floor feel as if it submerged them in the lava. But now, they could feel vitality and vigor from Esther Ling's Mu Ning, as if they were in the spring when the snow had just melted. Everyone felt immediately revived and vigorous.</p>

  <p>Esther Ling led the many top-level war lords of the Demon Night to ramble towards Xun. Her eyes gazed across the group of people before her.</p>

  <p>Then she went down on one knee and greeted Xun, "Your majesty!"</p>

  <p>All in unison the top-level war lords that followed Esther Ling acted and knelt down.</p>

  <p>After glancing at the top-level war lords, Xun broke her silence and spoke, "Stand up."</p>
