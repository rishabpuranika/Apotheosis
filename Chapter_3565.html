<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Chaim came down from the arena and noticed Zheng off stage. Smiling, he asked, "Zheng, have you finished your cultivation as well?"</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples were watching the fight on the arena and only a few had seen Zheng here, in front of it.</p>

  <p>Chaim's words pricked the ears of all the disciples on the first floor, who suddenly turned towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng had turned the City Guard House of the Myriad Spirits City into the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, lately he'd spent most of his time either travelling away or communicating with the races in the city.</p>

  <p>Getting an audience with him on the Other Shore was not easy.</p>

  <p>However, in the Land of Sword Grief, he was a junior disciple. The difference in status between them was slight, so naturally this made them more comfortable in making requests of him.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Zheng! I seem to recall some race gifting you a rare golden turtle.</p>

  <p>Could I have it please?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, when will you distribute the soul crystal again?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I have received two hundred thousand soul pills. May I keep them for myself?"</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was not very rich on the Other Shore. Even in the Desire World, the soul crystal was rare.</p>

  <p>Neither finding the soul crystal nor obtaining soul pills was an easy task for the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, but they still had to share what they got with the stronghold.</p>

  <p>The stronghold would take care of the disciples and distribute the resources according to their needs. However, several races in the Myriad Spirits City often blackmailed the Oneness Sky Palace before, forcing them to pay a large number of tributes every year. This imposed a heavy burden on the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But once Zheng had arrived, they didn't need to pay the tributes anymore.</p>

  <p>Instead, the Myriad Spirits City now paid tributes to them, and so did the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though the resources of the entire Stage Fourteen rested in Zheng's hands. How could the Land of Sword Grief's disciples not be jealous?</p>

  <p>Zheng had already let Chaim and Dorothy distribute the resources once.</p>

  <p>And all the disciples on the first floor had benefited greatly.</p>

  <p>But the human beings' desire knew no bounds. The Oneness Sky Palace had been quite poor in the past. The disciples had to cultivate on their own because the palace didn't have many resources for them.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was now obscenely rich.</p>

  <p>The disciples from Stage Fifteen, Stage Sixteen, and Stage Seventeen, as well as those from the higher stages such as Cleon, who was at the top of the first floor, intended to head back to Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Cleon might have a grudge against Zheng but that mattered little compared to the soul crystal and the other benefits possible.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng was surrounded by the numerous disciples on the first floor.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Chaim had not at all anticipated a reaction like this when he greeted Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He certainly hadn't expected this either.</p>

  <p>Seeing the crowd only growing larger, all he could do was wave his hand and yell out, "Everyone, please leave these dealings on the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>This rule was well understood by all.</p>

  <p>But getting a meeting with Zheng in the Myriad Spirits City was quite difficult. They had to turn to the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race. But Zheng was here in person. They would not let this opportunity slip by.</p>

  <p>"Talking about them here is the same as talking about them on the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"We are both disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. There is no need to complicate things."</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>A sharp and menacing voice bellowed over the rest.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to discover that it came from Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Zheng had carried Dorothy all the way from Stage Thirteen to Stage Fourteen that day. The disciples were aware of their relationship and the knowledge of it had spread through the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Dorothy was held in high esteem and so no one would dare to respond to her cold rebuke.</p>

  <p>"If you need or want to do something, turn to Chaim. He will record your requests. If your requests are reasonable, Zheng will fulfill them. He may have taken over the Myriad Spirits City but the resources are not limitless. You should know that he doesn't owe you anything," Dorothy continued.</p>

  <p>After occupying the Myriad Spirits City, Zheng had given the resources he had collected to Chaim for allocation and hadn't imposed any restrictions.</p>

  <p>Almost all the requests of the disciples were granted.</p>

  <p>But human beings were all greedy. The disciples on the first floor waited eagerly in the Myriad Spirits City. Apart from the share left for Zheng, the resources that were collected were instantly divided up by them.</p>

  <p>If things continued this way, it wouldn't be long before all the disciples on the first floor were waiting in the Myriad Spirits City for Zheng to raise them.</p>

  <p>This was not only disadvantageous for Zheng, but for all the disciples of the entire Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>"Princess Dorothy is right. Zheng has asked me to act on his behalf. If you have any requests, present them to me," Chaim responded with a smile.</p>

  <p>However, their demands were mostly excessive and unreasonable and Chaim would not agree to them. Plus, Dorothy's words had upset them.</p>

  <p>"Humph, what's the use of turning to you?"</p>

  <p>"It's said that the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race turn in as much as ten thousand finger-size chunks of soul crystal every month, but we get only one finger-size chunk."</p>

  <p>"Chaim, I have already asked you to help me get an Other Shore Token from Clyde. It's not a difficult task, yet you refused me point blank."</p>

  <p>The disciples who had just been fawning over Zheng now flipped their attitudes to blame Chaim.</p>

  <p>It implied that Zheng was under fire too.</p>

  <p>But they dared not offend Zheng and instead targeted Chaim.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at their sudden change in attitude.</p>

  <p>He knew he would obtain a massive amount of resources when he occupied the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>The resources in Stage Fourteen were too many for just him. As a member of the Oneness Sky Palace, he figured he should repay the palace. He was also willing to share some of the resources with the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief but he had never expected this reaction.</p>

  <p>Just then, from the back door of the bronze building, Elvinia walked out. In an icy tone she said, "Do not cut down the tree that gives you shade. You were bullied in the Myriad Spirits City for ages and said nothing. Now that Zheng and I have taken it, you can't seem to ask for enough."</p>

  <p>Elvinia had also contributed to the prosperity of the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Fourteen. Her words left everyone dead silent.</p>

  <p>Some were still not satisfied. From the corner, Abdul suddenly spoke out,</p>

  <p>"According to the law of the Land of Sword Grief, the disciples should turn in half of the resources they have got and the remainder should then be distributed among the rest of us. We have followed this law before, so the requests we make..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, a golden scroll appeared in Elvinia's hand. She sneered and opened the scroll. "The imperial edict of Eastern Emperor Taiyi says that all the resources Zheng and I obtain belong to us. We don't need to share them with the Land of Sword Grief. We can distribute them as we like. Read the edict carefully!" she growled.</p>

  <p>Elvinia would show no politeness towards these despicable ingrates.</p>
