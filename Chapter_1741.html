<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The deafening roar reverberated through the air around the Killing Sword Mountain like an evil spirit.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the huge faces were no different from evil spirits.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was facing this alone, he would have definitely been terrified.</p>

  <p>But as Xun was with him, Luo Zheng felt more confident. After all, two people were always better than one, even though her presence was just spiritual.</p>

  <p>As he realized that lightning somehow had an effect on these giant faces, Luo Zheng decided he needed to deal lightning damage to them.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword contained three kinds of sword techniques. Aside from the Nether God Shadow, it could also produce wind blades and lightning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng poured his chaotic energy into the sword. Countless shadow whips were formed from it, and they lashed crazily at the gigantic faces in the air.</p>

  <p>Pak! Pak! Pak! Pak!</p>

  <p>The enormous face nearest to Luo Zheng suffered the most damage from the strikes of lightning, and was finally dissipated into a cloud of malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>This scene bolstered Zheng's confidence even further.</p>

  <p>The only thing that worried him at the start was that he didn't know if these faces could be affected by anything. Since he had already seen that they could be destroyed by lightning, then defeating them wouldn't be hard.</p>

  <p>The faces were floating towards him at a very slow pace. Even though they were numerous, Luo Zheng had a lot of time on his hands.</p>

  <p>After just a couple of minutes, all the huge faces surrounding Luo Zheng had been eliminated.</p>

  <p>"That was great!" Luo Zheng breathed out a sigh of relief. A look of tranquility passed on his face. "Now, I can focus on finding a way out of here."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished the sentence, he noticed that Xun was looking at him in a strange way. Then he realized that her gaze was not directed at him, but at something directly behind him.</p>

  <p>"Ahem! Ahem!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately turned around and saw a huge head with a gaping mouth, which had attempted to take a bite out of him.</p>

  <p>The head's facial features were similar to those of the giant faces that had attacked him before; but when they were compared, the giant faces seemed like they were made as masks for the head, as if the head was the original.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Before the bite landed on his skin, Luo Zheng shifted and evaded instinctively using the Eight Smoky Melodies. Simultaneous with his retreat, a long whip of lightning slithered out of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword and continued to thrash the head.</p>

  <p>The way that those strange eyes stared at him gave him a weird feeling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had expected from the start that lightning would still be effective in dealing with this as it always did. However, the tenacity of this head eluded his understanding. Or maybe, this thing was not susceptible to lightning at all.</p>

  <p>Not only was it resistant to lightning damage, its movement speed was also quicker than the huge faces from earlier.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>When Xun thrust her spear at the head, the spear shadow pierced a huge hole through it.</p>

  <p>The spear had the ability to destroy everything, but it failed to destroy the head. After a large hole was pierced on it, its face contorted into an even more horrible grimace, which only added to its terrible appearance.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng proceeded forward rapidly, he caught sight of another gigantic head coming towards him from the left side. He could also see some faint red shadows originating from the red mist of the malicious Mu Ning nearby. It was probably more of these gigantic heads.</p>

  <p>It seemed that these things were originally concealed within the malevolent Mu Ning of the killing Sword Mountain. It was Luo Zheng who made them reveal themselves.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't think of any reason why these things had been hidden in the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the malicious Mu Ning was too strong and finally coalesced into these forms of malicious Mu Ning?</p>

  <p>Originally, countless swords were embedded into the Killing Sword Mountain, and many warriors left their malicious Mu Ning into the mountain.</p>

  <p>As the malicious Mu Ning accumulated, it was possible for this kind of phenomenon to occur.</p>

  <p>Given this premise, it was highly probable, but how could it explain what was going on with the tombstone? What was going on with the spatial maze array?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not think straight. This time, he was afraid that he had gotten into real trouble.</p>

  <p>After circling around the area a few times, Luo Zheng once again found himself at the starting point. Another tombstone appeared in front of him. The spatial maze array wasn't dangerous, but more and more gigantic heads were being materialized. They started to crowd against one another, almost formed into a wall, and pushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Things were really unusual in this place. Although Zheng's physical body was strong, it wasn't of any help in terms of destroying these heads.</p>

  <p>What he needed to do the most was still break the spatial maze array.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw the walls formed by the giant heads that were approaching him, Luo Zheng knew that he didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, a dark shadow suddenly rushed past from the side.</p>

  <p>Looking closely, Luo Zheng observed that the black shadow moved with an unusual agility, as if it was a black cat or something similar. However, he knew that a normal cat or dog would not be able to survive in that place, nor have such incredible speed. It might be some kind of small ferocious beast.</p>

  <p>"Follow it!" Xun reminded him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already on the move even before she told him to.</p>

  <p>He knew he would be in big trouble if he did not leave this place soon.</p>

  <p>He wasn't able to find any clues to help him break through the spatial maze array. Luo Zheng did not know the importance of the black shadow's appearance at that moment, but it would be a wise choice to follow it for now.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The black shadow moved forward continuously hidden within the malicious Mu Ning. Even though Luo Zheng was focusing all his efforts at following it, he had a really hard time discerning it from the darkness surrounding it.</p>

  <p>The shadow had four slender legs. Its running speed was almost equal to Zheng's as he flew close to the ground.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable thing was that the black shadow ran not in a straight line, but in a zigzag pattern.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that Luo Zheng had decided to use the Eight Smoky Melodies, which was an incredibly tricky movement technique to begin with, so he was barely able to keep up with this black shadow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lost track of time while rushing forward following the black shadow.</p>

  <p>He astonishingly realized that the scenery around him seemed to be different. He finally confirmed that he had escaped the spatial maze array when the tombstone was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>"We are out of the spatial maze array!" Luo Zheng laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't celebrate too soon," Xun said without expression.</p>

  <p>Zheng's movement speed slowed down after he left the spatial maze array.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he also noticed that the black shadow's speed was decreased significantly.</p>

  <p>"It's strange, huh?" Xun asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his agreement, his expression becoming serious again. This black shadow strangely seemed to be intentionally guiding him forward.</p>

  <p>'I wonder where this thing is taking me?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The intricacy of the situation in the Killing Sword Mountain baffled Zheng's mind. The black shadow might be leading him intentionally to a more desperate situation, so he was wary of being in dire trouble.</p>

  <p>'Is this black shadow really leading me forward to help me? Where does it want to lead me to?'</p>

  <p>Just as these thoughts crossed his mind, Luo Zheng pulled to a stop. Likewise, the black shadow also stopped in its tracks, about a hundred feet away from him. It seemed to turn its head back to look at him.</p>

  <p>With the thick malicious Mu Ning separating them, Luo Zheng wasn't able to clearly see what the black shadow's form was. But he definitely saw a pair of shiny green eyes staring back at him on the head of the black shadow, scaring him a little bit. He felt a sudden impulse to kill the black shadow immediately, but he wasn't able to because of its speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood in confrontation with the black shadow for a while. He really needed to have at least an inkling of what the black shadow's intention was.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng began to gather strength in his legs. If he wanted to catch this thing, he planned to take it by surprise.</p>

  <p>Angling himself slightly forward, he suddenly unleashed his potential as he sprinted towards the black shadow. But at the same time he dashed towards it, the black shadow pulled away from him with an incredible speed. This reaction speed was extraordinarily fast.</p>
