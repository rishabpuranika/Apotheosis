<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3881 Completely Absorbing </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was the most formidable magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven. When he yielded the handle of the Purple Lightening Hammer securely in his grip, the lightning snake emitting extremely daunting aura coiled itself around it till it reached the surface of the hammer.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>The breathtakingly eminent aura radiating from the pure purple lightning made the onlookers gasp in awe.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained rooted to their spots, and their pupils shrank visibly at this sight. Apparently, they too felt intimidated by the daunting presence of the Purple Lightening Hammer.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven seemed unbothered and refused to hold back.</p>

  <p>He had attempted to catch the two for quite a long time without tasting the sweet nectar of success. Because of that, his patience had run out, and there was no longer any room for error.</p>

  <p>When the black fire was extinguished by Gerald, he would catch up again.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven feared if he didn't act quickly, everything he worked so hard for would slip away from his hands once more.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at the space ahead of him and raised his hammer before smashing it into thin air.</p>

  <p>Visually, there was nothing in front of him.</p>

  <p>But when he swung the hammer in the air, it seemed to have hit an obstruction that was indestructible. As a result, the collision sent down shockwaves as it experienced violent tremors. The repercussions were so severe that they pushed back the Grandmaster of Heaven a few steps.</p>

  <p>Amidst the wild outburst of the explosion, countless bolts of thin purple lightning gathered and morphed themselves into the shape of a thick lightning snake that charged towards Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Acting on his sharp reflexes, Fuxi took the initiative and lifted Zheng up right in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The moment the lightning snake came in contact with Zheng's body, it switched its previous ferocious form and transformed into many purple lightning flowers. Within a flash, Zheng had absorbed more than half of the energy of the purple lightning snake, causing its intensity to weaken.</p>

  <p>However, after the lightning snake jumped on Zheng's body once, the rest of it switched its course of direction to pounce at Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>It was one of the attributes of thunder and lightning. Once a bolt of lightning was released, it would jump several times before coming to a stop.</p>

  <p>Even though it was weakened by Zheng absorbing more than half of its energy, the remaining energy of the purple lightning snake still posed as a severe threat to Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When the lightning snake bounced off of him a third time, its energy was reduced substantially. Even so, when it struck the Snake Goddess, it sent her lightweight body flying high before she fell to the ground with a heavy thump.</p>

  <p>The moment Fuxi's body was thrown off like a ragdoll, Zheng's physical body lost contact with him as he was forced to let go of his hand.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the circumstances, the Grandmaster of Heaven reached out to grab Zheng. However, the energy formed due to the space fluctuation was consumed by Zheng's body before he could lay his hands on him. How could he catch him now?</p>

  <p>Frustrated by the constant delays, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned before executing the Grand Teleportation technique to directly appear beside Zheng. Only then did he manage to grab Zheng and he carried him on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>After securing Zheng, the Grandmaster of Heaven had no business left with Fuxi or the Snake Goddess. He could just ignore them and move on.</p>

  <p>But when he began to recall all the unnecessary trouble these two had caused him, a wild fit of rage began to consume every fiber of his being.</p>

  <p>With a tight grip on his Purple Lightening Hammer, he charged in the direction of Fuxi's motionless body with a newly found desire for revenge.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by darkness, Zheng was still recovering from his daze.</p>

  <p>Although he had no sense of direction on what he should do, he decided he could not just sit back and watch anymore.</p>

  <p>The appearance of those light dots gave off the impression that they were connected to him in some way. However, they did not rely on his sheer will, and they didn't seem to be affected by the depth of his comprehension either.</p>

  <p>He had thought long and hard about it, but he still failed to come up with a logical conclusion to interpret the situation.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Another light dot flickered freely in the air as it lit up.</p>

  <p>Zheng's consciousness quickly swept across the light dot.</p>

  <p>As per his analysis, it only contained the explosive power of both thunder and lightning...</p>

  <p>Zheng's consciousness did not linger on this light dot.</p>

  <p>In fact, the energy entrapped in each light dot was free of all impurities and thus was formidable. As long as he could figure out a way to gain control of even one of them, he could bear the fruit of pure primitive power.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was overwhelmed by the presence of so many light dots dominating the space. It so happened that this was only one of the over 180 light dots.</p>

  <p>In his confusion, Zheng didn't realize there were a total of 187 light dots after this one was lit up!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, within the boundaries of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the bronze monkey couldn't contain his excitement as he watched this scene unfold. He kept jumping up and down enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the bronze monkey, the bronze bird, the bronze snake, and the bronze human maintained their composure. However, the intensity of the sparkle igniting in their eyes testified their increasing expectations.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was pure. But at the very same time, it had lost all of its distinctive characteristics.</p>

  <p>It was the creatures that had entered the sacred cup that had once again made the ancestry-level bloodline complete. Simultaneously, it became complicated and also managed to reclaim its once lost characteristics!</p>

  <p>"The 187th light column has risen!" the bronze human murmured, concealing his apparent excitement.</p>

  <p>Each of them was at the edge of their seats, anticipating whether the legend could finally come true.</p>

  <p>Although their growing excitement was undeniable, they still harbored concerns in a deep corner of their existence.</p>

  <p>After all, legends were sometimes nothing more than myths altered through history...</p>

  <p>The remaining light columns seemed to have no intention of rising.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the deep pits of darkness, Zheng felt his consciousness slowly sink into an unusual state, which he had never experienced before.</p>

  <p>In fact, after each light dot appeared before him, Zheng sensed a more in-depth understanding build up in his mind about the energy it carried inside.</p>

  <p>But after that light dot rose up just now, something far stranger happened.</p>

  <p>He could feel the light dots which connected to his left and right sides, and deduce those that did not exist!</p>

  <p>It all came naturally to him. It was as if right after someone counted from one to four, without a hitch, Zheng began to count from five to eight.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Completely engulfed in this strange state of deduction, those dots of light that didn't exist suddenly appeared and stationed themselves in their spots!</p>

  <p>One, two, three...</p>

  <p>In the map, one after the other, many light pillars began to extend at a frightening yet even speed!</p>

  <p>Previously the light pillars in the map made a sudden appearance, but then they stopped growing just as abruptly as they came. Now that the other light pillars appeared with a constant speed, there was definitely something mysterious about this!</p>

  <p>"Is it finally starting?"</p>

  <p>"Is this really happening?"</p>

  <p>"The moment that was once witnessed by history repeats itself. That legend is true!"</p>

  <p>The four statues couldn't help themselves, wanting to get a closer look at the incredible scene taking shape right in front of them. Each of them left the pillars again and walked to the edge of the square to feast their eyes on something they had waited for desperately to happen.</p>

  <p>In a short while, the remaining 186 light pillars had gradually risen one after the other.</p>

  <p>In the map, below the sacred cup, the light pillars were arranged in equal proportions, and they were evenly distributed on every portion, forming a pattern.</p>

  <p>When the very last light column connected itself with the others, the map became flawless!</p>

  <p>Purr...</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline in the sacred cup began to boil and drill into Zheng's body. The thick blood in the cup emptied itself at an alarming speed as if rushing to familiarize itself with his body.</p>

  <p>Ever since the ancestry-level bloodline existed in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, it had never decreased.</p>

  <p>Instead of saying that one fused with the ancestry-level bloodline within the sacred cup at will, it was more accurate to say that the ancestry-level bloodline gave the warrior who entered the sacred cup the powerful bloodline and unfathomable power...</p>

  <p>But this time was different.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline actually drilled itself into Zheng's body willingly.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was as thick as glue. When it moved along Zheng's meridians, his meridians bulged out in such a way that it looked as if a little rat was frantically moving along them.</p>

  <p>Zheng could endure the massive volume of blood pouring into him because of his astonishingly strong body. If his body fell short of the requirement and was weaker than it was, his meridians would probably burst open due to not being able to hold it all in.</p>

  <p>After a short while, all the blood that originally filled up the sacred cup had been emptied into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>At this sight, the four bronze statues' mouths fell to the ground with utter astonishment. Silence reigned the air before the bronze bird took the initiative and spoke, "Has the ancestry-level bloodline... been possessed by him?"</p>

  <p>Judging by the bronze bird's growing grim expression, he seemed to be thirsting for the ancestry-level bloodline that was now possessed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>The increasing desperation in his eyes felt like he was eager to cut open Zheng's belly to extract all of it for himself.</p>

  <p>The bronze snake beside him had a similar intention. Although they were happy to see Zheng create such a miracle, it was difficult for them to digest the fact that he took away all of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Well, let him take it!"</p>

  <p>The bronze monkey, who had been very radical from the start, seemed to have thought of something. His eyes flashed in response to his emotions and reflected a different color, as if he was expecting something big to happen.</p>
