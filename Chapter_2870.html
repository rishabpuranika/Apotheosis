<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This is the Truth Boat!"</p>

  <p>The boat formed by the Truth of Cultivation Nature was like a real object that could be touched.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out and knocked on the railing. An audible echo sounded.</p>

  <p>He knew that this was not in fact real. Even his own body was turned from the soul. The Truth Boat was probably something that was imagined in a certain method.</p>

  <p>"This sea..."</p>

  <p>The last time Zheng had stepped into the Sea of Truth, he had seen a red sea.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the sea was blue.</p>

  <p>The sea was emitting a vast aura, as if all the mysteries of the chaos were gathered within it.</p>

  <p>With a ghostly howl, the sea before him rolled up suddenly and a gust of wind blew over.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a chill run down his spine.</p>

  <p>The chilly air blew into the Soul of Light, penetrating into it and causing Zheng to shiver.</p>

  <p>"No wonder one can cross the Sea of Truth only after turning their soul into a Soul of Light. If one's soul is not powerful enough, the wind will blow at it and smash it into pieces!"</p>

  <p>Only now did Zheng understand why it was so difficult for the people who had come before him to advance in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of passing the Sea of Truth with the soul was probably much higher than with the physical body.</p>

  <p>A splash sounded from his left, like something had fallen into the flowing water.</p>

  <p>A boat had appeared out of nowhere and fallen into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng had experienced it and immediately understood that this person might have just comprehended the complete Truth of Godly Way as he had done.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had no interest in communicating with anyone. An idea flashed through his mind, and the boat at his feet began to move forward. As soon as his boat moved forward, the boat behind followed closely.</p>

  <p>As he stood on the Truth Boat, Zheng felt like he was in an ice cellar, his soul power being consumed even more than usual.</p>

  <p>He slowed a little after he had traversed quite some distance. To his surprise, the boat behind him also slowed down.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused, but a clear voice sounded from behind him. "Could you please move a little faster?"</p>

  <p>At this, Zheng smiled faintly and responded, "You can overtake me if you want to move faster. Why do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"My soul is not as strong as yours. I can save some soul power by following you," the voice said.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng couldn't see the warrior's face, he was somehow attracted to her pleasant voice. 'She must be a beautiful woman, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Can you really save soul power by following me?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course! The powerful warriors usually gather together to cross the Sea of Truth. It's more difficult to cross the sea alone. It is a coincidence that we met here and I'm glad about that," the woman said, with a smile in her voice. She was cottoning up to Zheng in order to keep following him.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. He recalled that when he had first entered the Sea of Truth, all the boats were arranged in order.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng said, agreeing to her following him.</p>

  <p>He sat down and concentrated on driving the boat forward.</p>

  <p>As he sped up, the boat behind him accelerated as well.</p>

  <p>They had moved forward for a while when the warrior behind him asked,</p>

  <p>"Why are you crossing the Sea of Truth alone?"</p>

  <p>"You are also alone, right?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I...I'm different," the woman replied.</p>

  <p>"What's the difference?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm unique. Those guys don't deserve to be with me," the warrior said, a hint of pride in her voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he said, "It doesn't matter if you are unique in this world. You still have to cross the sea like the others."</p>

  <p>"But most people won't be able to reach the Other Shore in their whole lives. I am destined to reach the Other Shore!" she answered confidently.</p>

  <p>"Really? Many congratulations!" Zheng said sincerely.</p>

  <p>He had a vague idea about who this woman was. She was probably a powerful warrior of some great force in the Source World, or an inheritor of a certain strong master.</p>

  <p>He could tell from the aura of her soul that her soul power was on par with his. Hiding behind his boat was just a ruse to save her soul power.</p>

  <p>The woman continued to follow Zheng as they moved forward. She asked questions from time to time, wanting to figure out Zheng's identity and background. Zheng lied and made up an identity.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that there was a freak in the Sea of Truth not long ago?" the woman asked.</p>

  <p>"A freak?" Zheng asked, taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I don't really believe it, but they say there was a guy who didn't rely on the Truth Boat and swam naked in the Sea of Truth with the intention of crossing it. That's incredible, isn't it?" the woman said.</p>

  <p>"Swim to the Other Shore." Zheng's jaw dropped as he realized that the woman was talking about him.</p>

  <p>Had this news spread throughout the Source World?</p>

  <p>It was indeed shocking to see a guy use his physical body to swim in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>After the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace left the Sea of Truth, they immediately reported this to the elders of the palace.</p>

  <p>But the Source World was vast and it took a long time for some rumors to spread through it. Once the senior members of the Oneness Sky Palace came to know about this, they ordered the disciples of the palace not to tell anyone about it. So the news of the strange swimmer had only been spread to a select few within a small range.</p>

  <p>But the woman enjoyed a special status and had heard the news from her clan's elders, which was why she paid attention to it and accorded it some importance.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it horrible? The Sea of Truth can turn all Souls of Light into nothingness. That guy can actually swim freely in the sea. I wonder where he comes from," the woman continued to exclaim. "I don't think he is too far away. Within this period of time, I've spent two Soul Bamboos in order to break through the shackles and enter the Sea of Truth. Maybe I can meet that guy."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed terrifying," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>Only after one's soul entered the Sea of Truth would they understand that the Sea of Truth was dreadful. Their soul would be wiped out instantly if infected with the water of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>It was easy to guess how the others felt when they saw someone swimming almost casually in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the woman chatted and as time passed, they traveled quite a long distance. They were close to the end of the first section of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>It was then that dozens of Truth Boats appeared on the other side of the sea.</p>

  <p>They were not moving against the current, but heading straight for Zheng and the woman.</p>
