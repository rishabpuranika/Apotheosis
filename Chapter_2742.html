<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2742 The Great Fiends </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Amidst the thick mist above the altar stood a huge figure.</p>

  <p>When the figure slowly retracted his fist, the flat body of the little fiend twisted and resumed his original shape.</p>

  <p>"Master, please forgive me!" the little fiend cried in fear, dropping to his knees on the altar.</p>

  <p>At this moment, another mass of blood appeared next to the little fiend.</p>

  <p>The blood rapidly coagulated and took the shape of another little fiend.</p>

  <p>The two little fiends had been refined to death by Clark after being captured by the Holy Beings, so they had been revived at the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region, which was a lot faster than running back from the third stage.</p>

  <p>However, the little fiends actually hadn't wanted to come back at all.</p>

  <p>Since their mission had failed, the ones who returned first would have to bear the brunt of their master's anger.</p>

  <p>"Master, you can't blame us for that. We failed because Wrath came too late. The Soul Devouring Bugs had already started to disperse by then.</p>

  <p>And after the Holy Beings rushed out of the area covered by the Soul Devouring Bugs, we were no match for them at all..."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The little fiend which had just appeared tried to defend himself, but he was met with a huge fist in response.</p>

  <p>The two little fiends were smashed into pieces of meat.</p>

  <p>However, this heavy punch was not at all a punishment for the little fiends.</p>

  <p>They could not feel pain— at least not in the physical sense.</p>

  <p>What the two little fiends feared was that their master would give them other punishments. The fiends had numerous methods of torture. Some of these methods were so sophisticated that they could be called art.</p>

  <p>In fact, putting aside their ugly appearances, the fiends had an excellent talent for art.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. It was only a test. They are the strongest warriors in the divine land. It's impossible for you to stop them," the huge figure in the mist said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"If you knew it was an impossible task, why did you assign it to us?" one of the little fiends muttered in complaint.</p>

  <p>Just like the monsters in the Abyss Demon Region had sprung into existence from the negative emotions of the divine citizens, the little fiends had sprung into existence from the negative emotions of the fiend race. They all had extremely terrible personalities and could rarely control their tempers.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to be the food of the Ghost Dog?" the loud voice from the mist shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>The little fiend immediately shut up.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With thunderous footsteps, the huge figure walked into the depth of the mist and left.</p>

  <p>On the right side of the altar, there was a flat, thousand-foot-wide road.</p>

  <p>The road was paved with square stones that were closely packed together, and on the surface of each square stone, extremely complicated patterns were engraved.</p>

  <p>These patterns were all connected to each other, forming a beautiful painting on the surface of the road.</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine that the fiends, which represented chaos and destruction, would decorate their habitats to such a point.</p>

  <p>At the end of the road stood a great hall which was ten thousand feet high. It was supported by 66 stone pillars, all of which had sculptures of different shapes.</p>

  <p>Compared to the divine land, the Abyss Demon Region didn't have many resources. The materials that had been used to build this great hall were definitely not on par with the materials that wealthy clans on the Floating Islands used.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in terms of aesthetics, this great hall was more exquisite and magnificent than any structure built by the True Gods.</p>

  <p>The huge figure walked along the road all the way to the door of the great hall. The mist covering his body slowly dispersed, revealing his true appearance.</p>

  <p>He was a great fiend who stood at a formidable height of six thousand feet.</p>

  <p>He had a ferocious face and dark red skin. The huge muscles in his body contained a natural explosive force.</p>

  <p>Over the generations, the imagination of the divine citizens, namely the Faith Energy, had created, in the name of fiends, deadly monsters with terrifying power.</p>

  <p>All kinds of shiny pendants were hanging from different parts of this great fiend's body. Some of these pendants were in the shape of a hexagon, some of them were in the shape of a triangle, and many others had complicated shapes.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The fiend pushed the door open. Then, he said indifferently, "Gallio, those guys have already reached the fourth stage."</p>

  <p>There was a large round table in the center of the great hall.</p>

  <p>Three other great fiends were sitting at the table having their meals.</p>

  <p>On top of the round table were a few creatures that were as tall as humans.</p>

  <p>These creatures had two arms and three legs. They were running quickly around the round table, carrying food back and forth.</p>

  <p>These creatures were called the fiend servants. They were also a kind of creature created by the fiends, and their duty was to serve the great fiends.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The great fiend sitting on the right side of the round table pooped some red berries into his mouth.</p>

  <p>These berries came from a kind of tree growing in the abyss. The fiends were very fond of them because the freshly-picked berries exuded the sweet taste of blood.</p>

  <p>The smell of blood pervaded the hall as Gallio chewed on the berries.</p>

  <p>Some of the fiend servants had a greedy glint in their eyes, but they continued to work hard to serve the great fiends.</p>

  <p>"Are we afraid of them, Stuart?" Gallio asked casually after swallowing the berries, wiping his big and sharp fingers with great care.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," replied Stuart, the red-skinned great fiend.</p>

  <p>Gallio smiled lightly. "Then what do we have to worry about?"</p>

  <p>All creatures in the Abyss Demon Region could be reborn infinitely, and the fiends were no exception.</p>

  <p>However, with every death, their accumulated Faith Energy would decrease and their power would be weakened.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the status of the fiends was so stable that such things would have little effect on them.</p>

  <p>"I think this is an opportunity for us. We can't always be restricted to the Abyss Demon Region," said Stuart with a look of yearning on his face.</p>

  <p>"We have thought about this for so many years, and now, finally, we have such a chance. Even if it's a little risky, why don't we take advantage of it?"</p>

  <p>The creatures in the forbidden land were fortunate enough to be born strong.</p>

  <p>However, it was their misfortune that, regardless of whether they were a strong great fiend or a weak fox, all of them were not real existences and were only illusions!</p>

  <p>After the great fiends had become the rulers of the Abyss Demon Region, they had begun to think about how to leave this damned place.</p>

  <p>Their goal was to conquer the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>However, as creatures of fantasy, they would vanish into thin air the moment they stepped out of the forbidden land. This was an inexorable law that even the most powerful fiends could not overcome.</p>

  <p>Still, the intelligent fiends had eventually managed to find a small loophole that would make it possible for them to leave the forbidden land and enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Gallio burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>The two other great fiends sitting with him laughed as well.</p>

  <p>"Why are you all laughing?" Stuart asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Just before you came, we took a vote on whether we should take such a risk. The result was 1 to 2. I lost," Gallio said with a smile. "I thought you would be on my side!"</p>
