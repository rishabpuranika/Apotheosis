<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng pushed the door open, Yudie hurriedly told him, "Zheng, these guests have already been waiting here for a long time."</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that Yudie was a little nervous, so he comforted her first. After that, he escorted her down from the second floor.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, masters!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng reached downstairs, he promptly bowed to the three people before him.</p>

  <p>Athemar asked, "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"This is my principal wife. Tia, greet these masters," Zheng responded honestly.</p>

  <p>As Zheng finished his words, Yudie bowed to them then respectfully retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>The three of them regarded Zheng with meaningful expressions.</p>

  <p>They thought back on what happened in the Vastness Mountain not long ago. They were surprised that Zheng had been married. They also wondered if he already had a child and if Yasamin and Flamine knew about this.</p>

  <p>But of course, it was none of their business. They came here to discuss what happened on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>To keep the absolute confidentiality of this topic, Athemar set up an invisible enchanted barrier with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>In this way, he could prevent Yudie, Trish, and Carrie from hearing their conversation.</p>

  <p>Yudie perfectly knew that they came here to discuss something important with Zheng. Since she was not interested in intruding in their affairs, she quietly stood aside.</p>

  <p>"You were truly amazing today! You destroyed half a temple of the Bearing race. You probably have lots of harvests, right?" Athemar said as he laughed, as if he actually saw Zheng rob the temple.</p>

  <p>Zheng cupped his hands and said, "I took all their Other Shore Tokens and soul crystal inside. I could just hand them over if the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't be able to endure their anger."</p>

  <p>Because he destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, the Oneness Sky Palace must be under a lot of pressure. Zheng didn't want to cause any more troubles for the palace.</p>

  <p>"You are quite gracious," Winchell said as he looked at Zheng with admiration. If it was him in this position, he probably wouldn't be willing to hand them over.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Goran snorted. He said, "For many years, the Oneness Sky Palace was bullied by the Bearing race. This time, you subdued them with your own power. What can they do to us next? You got them with your efforts so naturally, they now belong to you!"</p>

  <p>"But I'm worried that the Bearing race would seek revenge against the palace..." Zheng seemed hesitant.</p>

  <p>"For the past years, people have fought repeatedly for profit in the Source World," Athemar said after he took a sip of his tea. "A fierce war will break out sooner or later. Even if we don't provoke them, they will probably take revenge on us when that time comes. However, they might not dare take actions now."</p>

  <p>The three masters were very open-minded about these issues. They chose their own paths and followed their own fates. It was clear to them that a mere compromise could not stop the Bearing race from fighting against the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"In conclusion, you must hide your identity well on the Other Shore. Don't expose yourself to anyone, even to those who are from our palace!" Goran advised.</p>

  <p>After the accident that occurred on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace counted the number of trapped elite disciples.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the Vastness Mountain, all of the other six mountains had trapped elites. These included the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain. Strangely enough, disciples from the Vastness Mountain were not involved. Because of this, Goran thought that not everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace could be trusted.</p>

  <p>Zheng completely understood what they meant by this. He nodded and asked,</p>

  <p>"How is Milo now?"</p>

  <p>It was clear to Zheng that he wouldn't have been able to escape from the combined attack from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race by himself.</p>

  <p>Milo finally displayed an astonishing skill which allowed Zheng to escape.</p>

  <p>Without his help, the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace, including himself, would have been annihilated.</p>

  <p>With a dark look on his face, Athemar responded, "He hasn't regained consciousness yet."</p>

  <p>"Is his soul severely injured?" Zheng sighed and asked.</p>

  <p>During that time, Milo was completely engulfed by the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>How was he able to bear their ceaseless biting?</p>

  <p>"It's not because of the soul damage," Athemar shook his head as he explained.</p>

  <p>"Then, what?" Zheng asked with uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"You must have seen the sword strike Milo made," Athemar replied.</p>

  <p>"I did," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>For Zheng, Milo's final strike was absolutely incredible. It directly froze all the Champion Fish and even a part of the wall.</p>

  <p>Zheng was thoroughly puzzled. Milo's Soul of Light had not yet reached the level of Indigo Soul. However, his strike was much stronger than those of ordinary Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>"He had utterly overdrawn his talent. Therefore, he was severely punished.</p>

  <p>We are trying our best to revive him but it takes time," said Athemar.</p>

  <p>Yet, Athemar didn't mention to Zheng what talent Milo had overdrawn to launch that strike.</p>

  <p>The reason why they visited Zheng was to ease his worry and confirm the truth as well.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace would never admit that it was Zheng who destroyed the temple. However, the outside world still believed that Zheng had a close connection with the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, other forces wouldn't be able to blame the Oneness Sky Palace for whatever Zheng did on the Other Shore. Moreover, this could also scare other super forces and warned them that whoever dared provoke Oneness Sky Palace on the Other Shore would bring tragedy to themselves.</p>

  <p>Over the next couple days, the Bearing race negotiated with the Oneness Sky Palace. They demanded that the man who destroyed their temple return their soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace only admitted that they indeed stopped that man from demolishing the entire temple. However, it was beyond their ability to ask him to return the soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens he took from the temple for they had no idea who that man was.</p>

  <p>This kind of statement was almost hard to disprove. The Bearing race needed to swallow this bitter loss.</p>

  <p>Despite their anger, they kept their word. They asked the Sun Crow race to retreat from the Mountain Viewing Province. With this, the war between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race ceased temporarily.</p>

  <p>On Stage Four of the Other Shore, many Souls of Light moved back and forth through the temple of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>The ruins needed to be cleaned up while the collapsed beams needed to be rebuilt. For the Souls of Light in the Lust World, this was a very laborious project.</p>

  <p>As he returned to the Other Shore with his body again, Zheng headed to the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace. He wanted to get a space ring from that Thunder Beast.</p>

  <p>For many years, that Thunder Beast stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace's temple. It was a bit apprehensive of Zheng as it might be its first time to see a human body.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the Thunder Beast lowered its head and stretched out its tentacles when Zheng extended his hand toward it. It proceeded to make a carving around Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>Gradually, a shining square formed at Zheng's fingertips. Just as it was about to be completely formed, it suddenly broke like a glazed tile with a sound of "bang".</p>

  <p>"Woo?"</p>

  <p>For a moment, the Thunder Beast appeared stunned. It never expected this to happen.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also shocked as he stared at his fingertips. He had never thought that the Thunder Beast could fail.</p>

  <p>"Please do it again," Zheng implored.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Beast complied. It repeated the process for the second time but as soon as the space ring was almost formed, it broke again.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The Thunder Beast shook its head and now refused to make a space ring for Zheng the third time.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was filled with disappointment. He turned his head and spoke to Dorothy, "It seems like the physical body is unable to get a space ring here."</p>

  <p>Dorothy seemed relieved as she smiled and said, "Your body is invincible on the Other Shore. If you have a Sumeru Space, I'm afraid all of the good things here would be collected by you alone."</p>

  <p>In reality, Dorothy was happy about this.</p>

  <p>She was the only one who knew Zheng's secret on the Other Shore. Zheng needed her help in order to transfer those things he got on the Other Shore to his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>So if Zheng had gotten the space ring successfully, he would not need her help anymore. Hence, she would be useless to him.</p>
