<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1620 The Overbearing Mu Ning (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the warrior transcended the heavens and became a True God, the heavens carved out the stories of her life.</p>

  <p>As he continued through the Corridor of Emperor, Luo Luo Zheng looked at the murals one by one.</p>

  <p>Some of the murals included how the woman became a warrior, and how she was adored by the public. It also included a story on how she activated the Lotus Flower, and so on.</p>

  <p>'Apparently, when she reached the Life and Death Realm, she only activated one petal of the Hinayana Lotus Flower!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, unable to keep a shocked expression.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, the number of lotus petals activated was related to the ability to surpass the heavens. The more petals that the warrior would have activated, the higher chances for the warrior to transcend the heavens. To some extent, people consider it as something akin to a talent!</p>

  <p>The one who could only activate a single lotus petal was perceived as a very basic talent. Even an ordinary tenth-grade sacred place would not view such an ordinary warrior as a core disciple.</p>

  <p>The core disciples of an ordinary tenth-grade sacred place were capable of activating at least five to seven lotus petals.</p>

  <p>As he continued forward, Luo Luo Zheng began to understand how this woman became a True God.</p>

  <p>Every time she experienced a Heavenly Tribulation, she would always activate a lotus petal. This only meant that she was able to activate nine petals of the Hinayana Lotus Flower, after she had experienced nine small Heavenly Tribulations!</p>

  <p>When she was at the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm, she still activated a lotus petal for each Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>In the end, all of the lotus petals belonging to the Mahayana Lotus Flower and the Hinayana Lotus Flower had already fully bloomed. This was how the woman became the Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>It took her most of her lifetime to become the Godly Genius, and once she successfully made it, she had already reached the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm. She was so close to becoming a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed tiredly as he looked at the murals.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already activated thirty-five lotus petals after his first small Heavenly Tribulation. It was a lot, since only the last petal of the Mahayana Lotus Flower hadn't bloomed yet.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had passed through the various Heavenly Tribulations, his cultivation base had increased immensely. But no matter how hard he had tried so far, he couldn't activate the last lotus petal.</p>

  <p>It was only after activating the last lotus petal that he would be capable of becoming a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was at his wits end because he had absolutely no idea how long it would take him to make the last lotus petal appear.</p>

  <p>While walking past the murals, Luo Luo Zheng was able to catch up on the wonderful scenes of this beautiful woman's life, even including the scenes in which she occupied a position that could not be ignored in the entire universe and ascended to be a True God.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng finished going through the murals, another torch suddenly appeared in front of him!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes fixated on the torch, and Luo Luo Zheng could feel a strong, powerful Mu Ning radiating from it. It felt like the same Mu Ning emitted by Hannah, the True God, before. The stronger the Mu Ning grew, the more Luo Luo Zheng focused his attention on it, and he could feel its intimidating and extremely domineering pressure.</p>

  <p>'The flames... They're different... They could also contain the mark of another True God!'</p>

  <p>Surmising this, Luo Luo Zheng took another step forward.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>The flames combusted, and once again, Luo Luo Zheng stilled himself.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Luo Zheng found himself standing in the middle of an empty field. In the distance, he could see an isolated city. Behind him, he found tens of thousands of armed ogre soldiers and cavalries!</p>

  <p>In front of the isolated city's gate, a tall, burly ogre warrior loomed over it, guarding the gate with a large saber.</p>

  <p>The overbearing Mu Ning Luo Luo Zheng had felt earlier seemed to emit from the tall ogre warrior!</p>

  <p>"Attack the city! Attack!"</p>

  <p>With this order, countless ogre warriors roared and ran to seize the city.</p>

  <p>"I-Is this... the ogre civil war?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was astonished by the scene that unfolded in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior's laughter boomed throughout the battlefield. He held his saber high as he let the soldiers come at him. A few moments later, he was able to incapacitate a large portion of the enemies!</p>

  <p>'These soldiers are nothing compared to this magnificent ogre warrior.</p>

  <p>Their auras do not compare to his... Could it be that this ogre warrior is the True God of the second lamp?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered aimlessly.</p>

  <p>Just like what Hannah said, each lamp in the Corridor of Emperor recorded a True God's mark. These True Gods were all born of the same universe. It was through the Corridor of Emperor that the memories were never erased by the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>The soldiers screamed and roared. They were storming towards the True God and Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The first ogre warrior immediately charged at Luo Luo Zheng. As his burly figure flashed before his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng flicked his wrist and stole the giant sword from the enemy's hand. He quickly swung the sword against the soldiers.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Luo Luo Zheng was able to behead a dozen of ogres with one swoop!</p>

  <p>Almost just as quickly, Luo Luo Zheng could sense a strong, dangerous presence behind him. He then bent his body and lay prone on the ground, in order to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Woosh!</p>

  <p>A stream of formidable blade energy spurt out.</p>

  <p>The blade energy spread around, maintaining a distance of three feet with the ground. After Luo Luo Zheng lay down, the blade energy almost touched the tip of his nose.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the entire battlefield was consumed with the wails and screams of the tens of thousands of ogre warriors. The field had gotten violent and bloody very fast.</p>
