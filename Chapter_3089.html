  <p>With Fergus' strength, no one in the Dragon City dared to provoke him.</p>

  <p>The demand for Sword-reading Liquid exceeded the supply. Bottles of Sword-reading Liquid were sold out everywhere.</p>

  <p>It was definitely a lucrative business. The young man calculated that he could earn tens of millions of divine crystals each month from the robust sales of Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Of course, the young man was not the only one in the Taiyi Heaven Palace capable of producing the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>However, the others who could produce the liquid had their own reasons for not trying to compete with him. Some were simply not interested in the income, and others thought it shameful to get involved in such a business.</p>

  <p>This benefited the young man, who chose to stay in the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>"I heard that someone else was selling the Sword-reading Liquid at a lower price, to compete with Fergus," Kate said.</p>

  <p>The young man's brows furrowed. "Someone else? Is it someone from the Taiyi Heaven Palace? But they've already said they wouldn't get involved in the Sword-reading Liquid business."</p>

  <p>Kate spoke up. "No, it's not from Taiyi Heaven Palace. I think the new seller is a Flag Master in Dragon City."</p>

  <p>The young man wore an expression of disbelief. "How can that be? No mere Flag Master could produce the Sword-reading Liquid," he said.</p>

  <p>Taking a look at the young man, Kate pursed her lips and said, "He has just stepped into the Other Shore Realm. But he defeated Fergus though the latter spared no effort in the battle."</p>

  <p>"What?" The young man continued to look skeptical. "You believe he's actually able to produce the Sword-reading Liquid? That he is capable of Instant Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Kate said.</p>

  <p>There were often huge differences in the level of strength among the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Fergus, for example, had grown fat and complacent, and had been kicked out of the Heart Flow Sect. Yet he was still a force to be reckoned with. He had already reached the fifth stage of the Other Shore Realm, and he was in possession of a powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"If I had just reached the Other Shore Realm, it would be very difficult for me to face and defeat Fergus in an all-out battle," the young man said slowly. He frowned, wondering how a Flag Master had managed to beat Fergus.</p>

  <p>"Come on, no need to be modest," Kate said. She had full confidence in the young man. "Milo, you are adept at the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, and you have an innate capacity for the Flow Strike. Anyone affected by your Flow Strike finds it hard to resist. I believe that if you faced Fergus when you had just reached the Other Shore Realm, you might have been able to win against him too."</p>

  <p>The young man gave her a noncommittal smile. He then left the courtyard quickly.</p>

  <p>Kate followed him.</p>

  <p>"I want to meet him in person," the young man said, blinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>With knitted eyebrows, Kate replied, "I'm afraid that might be hard to arrange."</p>

  <p>"Why? Do you think someone will stop me?" the young man asked.</p>

  <p>"I do," Kate said with certainty.</p>

  <p>When one reached a certain position, they became aware of many hidden and unspoken rules.</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters and Alliance Chiefs were blind to the existence of such rules. Someone like Fergus faintly sensed them, but had no ability to discern them in greater detail.</p>

  <p>But Kate was among those who knew and followed the invisible rules.</p>

  <p>"So we'll just ignore the Flag Master? After what he's done?" The young man looked upset.</p>

  <p>"Even if you can't kill him, you can do something else to him, can't you? If you really want to see him, who would stop you?" Kate asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>The young man quickly grasped her meaning.</p>

  <p>Killing was not the only way to solve a problem. He could definitely think of ways to contact and warn the Flag Master without resorting to killing him.</p>

  <p>The market outside Dragon City was a busy place. The owner of the best spot? a good location with a high flow of people? had been changed.</p>

  <p>Standing inside the shop, Kenelm sighed inwardly, watching the crowds of people hurrying past the window.</p>

  <p>While his cultivation base hadn't improved much, he felt that his status had been significantly enhanced overnight.</p>

  <p>He and Beldene had suffered in the past whenever they tried to sell the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Customers who bought from them would haggle nonstop, trying to drive the price down. They would argue about the costs of production, or openly question the purity of the substance. Kenelm and Beldene needed to figure out how to handle such concerns on their own, without relying on Luo Zheng to get involved. Otherwise, what good were they?</p>

  <p>However, the situation now was completely different.</p>

  <p>People who passed by the shop would slow down and look at them with respect.</p>

  <p>They no longer haggled over the price, and willingly shelled out fifteen thousand divine crystals to buy a bottle of the Sword-reading Liquid. Of course, in fairness, that was a relatively low price.</p>

  <p>"Hello, my friend." Someone stopped in front of Kenelm, giving him an innocuous smile.</p>

  <p>The man was obviously an Other Shore Realm warrior. He was polite to Kenelm, even though Kenelm had yet to master even the complete Truth of Divine Dao. Kenelm heaved another inward sigh; he was not accustomed to this yet.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to buy a bottle of Sword-reading Liquid?" Kenelm asked.</p>

  <p>"No, not today. I'm here to meet your Flag Master. I'd like to join him," the man said smoothly.</p>

  <p>'Ah, another one who wants to join Luo Zheng!' Kenelm thought.</p>

  <p>The battle between Luo Zheng and Fergus had assumed an almost legendary status, and many who heard the story wanted to join Luo Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>The problem was that it was considered taboo to change sides and join another Flag Master. The former Flag Master would go out of their way to make things difficult for the new one who took on their old follower.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was different. He was not afraid of offending any Flag Master in or outside Dragon City.</p>

  <p>"Go that way, to your left..." Kenelm gave the man directions.</p>

  <p>Not only were warriors switching sides to join Luo Zheng, but many of the newcomers who had just climbed over the Sword Wall also chose to join Luo Zheng's ranks. In just a week, the number of people under Luo Zheng had risen from a hundred to a thousand.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a door opened softly on the third floor of the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng emerged from the room and walked slowly downstairs.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had disappeared down the stairs, another door opened. This time, Gant emerged from one of the rooms on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Gant had finally passed the tests in the room without getting kicked out.</p>

  <p>Had he managed this feat a month ago, he would have been greatly overjoyed. He would have gone straight to Sellers and tried to convince him to submit an application for him, so he could get admitted to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>However, he had become an admirer of Luo Zheng, and when he saw that Luo Zheng continued to train in Dragon City, he decided to stay for a while too.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! You've finally passed the tests of the first floor. Good job," Luo Zheng said in an encouraging tone.</p>

  <p>Gant sighed gloomily. "I'm so much weaker than you. You've already passed the tests in the rooms of second and third floors."</p>

  <p>Sellers was standing at the entrance of the Sword Tower. When he heard Gant's words, he laughed openly at him. "Ha! You've chosen the wrong person to compete with. Compare yourself to Luo Zheng, and you'll only get disappointed."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, several people wandered into the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>They were Alliance Chiefs. They were led by a man named Walter, who looked at Luo Zheng and gave him an ingratiating smile. "Luo Zheng, we admire your diligence. You have spent so much time here in the Sword Tower already.</p>

  <p>We know practice can get boring, and we are ashamed of ourselves that we have not yet invited you to one of our gatherings. Would you like to join us?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw Walter, Luo Zheng's face darkened. "Thank you for the invitation, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. I'm too humble to stand behind such a person as you," he said in a mocking tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no conflict with these Alliance Chiefs, and it was in his interest to maintain a good relationship with them.</p>

  <p>But the very sight of Walter filled him with disdain. When he thought of Walter's dubious morals, he couldn't help but feel antagonism towards him.</p>

  <p>Monica, for one, had been a follower of Walter. That night, when she had tried to put in a good word for Luo Zheng, Fergus punched her so hard that she almost died, yet Walter stood by and did nothing. He was truly cold-blooded.</p>

  <p>Walter saw that Luo Zheng despised him, and forced a wry smile. He had some idea of why Luo Zheng disliked him so much. He thought he could explain. But before he could speak, Luo Zheng and Gant started to move towards the tower entrance.</p>

  <p>Walter looked in Sellers' direction, hoping the old man would speak up and put in a good word for him. But Sellers kept his face expressionless. He did not say anything.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng left the Sword Tower, he saw something that gave him a sudden and inexplicable sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>A young man in a coir raincoat stood some distance away. He looked at Luo Zheng with gentle eyes.</p>

  <p>There was no hostility in his gaze, yet Luo Zheng felt as though he was being warned. The dread that rose in him was countless times stronger than what he had felt upon meeting Fergus.</p>
