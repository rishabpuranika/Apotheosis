<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents could not remain calm when they saw the Black Star despite knowing they were no match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Several divine-level talents would easily take a risk to obtain even an ordinary divine weapon. This was a supreme divine weapon after all.</p>

  <p>Even if they had to pay for it with their lives, they would still try to take it because the temptation was just too much.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Seven to eight divine-level talents shot out from the leaves in the 36th layer. Although they would be pulled down by an invisible force after they left the leaves, they were able to adjust their direction to a certain degree the moment they left the leaves.</p>

  <p>Of course, their target was the Black Star.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the warriors in the 36th layer, but the ones in the 37th layer also jumped down and joined in the fight for the Black Star.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the 34th and 33rd layers were also waiting for the opportunity to take action. They were only waiting for the Black Star to fall before they would join the fray without hesitation.</p>

  <p>When the golden leaf was destroyed by Zheng, all the fragments, including Zheng and the pickax, were thrown into the air by the force of gravity. The next moment, they were all pulled back down by an invisible force.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, be careful!" Randy, who stood on a leaf not far away, shouted out loud. He was still a fair distance away from Zheng and was unable to reach him. All he could do from this distance was warn him. It was the same for Camilla and Fiona.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened when he saw the warriors rushing towards him. He had spent a great deal of effort getting this pickax. These guys sure knew how to take advantage of things! However, it wasn't so easy to take advantage of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You want to rob me? You're courting death!" Zheng snorted derisively.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the soul pressure in his mind exploded.</p>

  <p>When he had released his soul pressure earlier, he had reserved some of it. Otherwise, with his soul fused with the world's will, it would have been impossible for these Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors to even approach him.</p>

  <p>The Black Star was extremely important to Zheng. He simply would not tolerate people trying to snatch it!</p>

  <p>Therefore, this time, Zheng's soul pressure had erupted with full force.</p>

  <p>He was falling extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he had fallen from the 35th layer to the 20th layer with the Black Star and the fragments of the golden leaf in tow. This was not a short distance from where Randy, Fiona, and the others were.</p>

  <p>But even though there were more than a dozen layers between them, when his soul pressure erupted, the faces of Randy, Fiona, and the other warriors, who hadn't left their leaves, turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>"His soul pressure is terrifying even from so far away. I'm afraid that Tianxing is truly enraged this time!" Randy said with a light shudder.</p>

  <p>Camilla sneered from not too far away. "Tianxing had to put his life on the line to break the leaf, yet these damned fellows have the gall to try to rob him. They're inviting their own deaths. No one can blame anybody!"</p>

  <p>Fiona sat on the edge of a leaf and swung her legs. She was indifferent to the scene playing out in front of her.</p>

  <p>In the past, she would have tried to stop them. Those warriors might not be able to survive this kind of soul pressure. However, at this moment, the balance in her heart was completely tilted. In her mind, she was thinking, 'What Tianxing is doing is right. If you dare to snatch his Black Star, you deserve to die.'</p>

  <p>Some warriors were still on their leaves. They were thanking their lucky stars that they didn't join the others in robbing Zheng. They, too, had wanted to rush down and fight, but they were either too far away from Zheng's leaf or they had restrained themselves. The warriors who had wisely decided to not give in to their impulse felt very happy that they were far away from the eruption. There was probably no one at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who could survive this soul pressure eruption.</p>

  <p>They could feel the force of Zheng's soul pressure even from this distance.</p>

  <p>More than ten divine-level talents were chasing after the Black Star and were only ten to twenty feet away from Zheng, with the closest one being only ten feet away. He had already reached out his hand to grab the Black Star, but he couldn't move forward even an inch. It was as if time had stopped at that moment.</p>

  <p>They were instantly killed by Zheng's soul pressure. Traces of blood flowed from their mouths, noses, ears and eyes. As they fell, the blood continued spilling out. No one could feel any life energy in their bodies.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Black Star landed in a ring of light at the bottom, followed by the divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>On one side of the pyramid, rings of light flashed constantly. Zheng stood firmly in the crater he had created earlier while the Black Star was nailed to the ground.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the rings of light above Zheng's head started flickering nonstop, and one by one, the corpses fell heavily to the ground.</p>

  <p>Crash! Thud! Splat!</p>

  <p>The corpses of the divine-level talents rained down around Zheng. He stood in the middle of the crater with his hand on the Black Star, like a god of death.</p>

  <p>Not all divine-level talents had entered the mine as one leaf could only hold one warrior at a time. Besides, if warriors were too far away from Zheng's leaf and their vision was blocked, then they wouldn't be able to figure out what had happened.</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents outside the pyramid, who were watching this scene unfold, were all terrified and cautious at the same time. Could it be that Zheng had gone berserk and was frantically slaughtering the divine-level talents? If that was really the case, no one here was capable of stopping him.</p>

  <p>"He has killed so many people! Why would Zheng kill them?"</p>

  <p>"What is that thing in his hand? That seems to be..."</p>

  <p>"If I'm not wrong, it is the Black Star that was buried in the golden leaf in the 35th layer."</p>

  <p>"How did he get his hands on it?"</p>

  <p>When the divine-level talents outside the pyramid noticed the Black Star, they completely forgot about the corpses on the ground.</p>

  <p>Killing some divine-level talents was nothing, but obtaining the Black Star was incredible. This was not something they could imagine. Even though the pickax was wrapped in a leaf, who had the ability to take it?</p>

  <p>This question had once been asked by the warriors of the four divine kingdoms. Now, the answer was obvious. It was Zheng!</p>

  <p>He walked out of the crater with the Black Star in his hand. He wasn't thinking about those people. All of Zheng's attention was focused on the pickax in his hand. He didn't care about the divine-level talents present at all as they were no match for him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the rings of light in the mine slowly faded away. Randy smiled and said, "Let's go out and take a closer look!"</p>

  <p>After Randy took his step first, the other warriors also followed. They all jumped off the leaves and started falling down.</p>

  <p>Bram, the crown prince of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, had a smile on his face. Zheng had exceeded his expectations long ago, and he could keep doing it over and over again.</p>

  <p>Previously, Bram had been insecure of Randy's strength and had started to suppress him. He had always held the absolute advantage, but now, because of Zheng alone, Bram would probably be suppressed by Randy, and he wouldn't be able to turn the situation around.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, Randy and Bram were brothers. Perhaps there was no need for them to compete against each other like this. Bram looked relieved, and he also left the leaf.</p>

  <p>Everyone went back outside the pyramid while Zheng stood nearby with the pickax in his hand. He was frowning slightly.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't figure out what material the pickax was made of. Even after he turned it in his hand over and over again and examined it closely, he still couldn't see anything special about it.</p>

  <p>"Is this really the so-called supreme divine weapon? It doesn't look extraordinary at all!"</p>

  <p>Whether it was the semi-divine weapon on Fiona's arm or Fredric's Heavenly Thunder Halberd, the momentum and might contained within them were incomparable to a normal sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Apart from its extremely tough material, Zheng couldn't see how the Black Star was similar to a divine weapon. And this was not just a normal divine weapon; it was a supreme divine weapon.</p>
