<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harper watched the scene in silence.</p>

  <p>He was so anxious that he wanted to interfere, but soon, he gave up that thought and calmed down.</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Bearing Sword is a godly sword...</p>

  <p>Only a warrior who enters the Other Shore Realm can truly wield it.</p>

  <p>If you want to use this godly sword, you need to fully comprehend the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. Otherwise, you will become the Shadow Bearing Sword's slave! But since your talent is so great...I wonder if you can break free from the Shadow Bearing Sword?"</p>

  <p>Harper murmured as he watched the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>Lorena's persuasion had aroused a glimmer of hope in Harper's heart.</p>

  <p>And this tiny ray of hope was Zheng.</p>

  <p>The worst thing in the world was hope turning into disappointment and despair.</p>

  <p>But right now, Harper still had a chance of survival. When the time came, he would not hesitate to sacrifice everything he had, but he hoped that it all meant something because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Come on. Don't let me down! If you can really tame the Shadow Bearing Sword while being a low-rank True God, I, Harper, will definitely follow and serve you for the rest of my life," Harper added.</p>

  <p>The color in Zheng's eyes gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>A powerful spiritual sense burst out from the Shadow Bearing Sword, pouring into his mind in the blink of an eye and exploring his soul.</p>

  <p>It was the soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword had accompanied Harper for countless years. It had been a part of many wars in the Source World. Under the infiltration of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, it had long formed its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>To be the owner of the Shadow Bearing Sword, one had to get its consent.</p>

  <p>One way to do this was to have a complete comprehension of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>Another method was to use another Truth of Godly Way to wipe out the marks in the Shadow Bearing Sword, but this was a much higher expectation of the sword holder. It was impossible to do unless the warrior was at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>But right now, Zheng felt stuck because he didn't fit either of these requirements.</p>

  <p>After he activated the Shadow Bearing Sword with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, its sword soul counterattacked immediately.</p>

  <p>The moment the sword soul infiltrated his mind, it restrained his soul, causing it to fall into an endless abyss of darkness.</p>

  <p>He couldn't feel the existence of his physical body anymore, and there was no connection between him and the outside world at all.</p>

  <p>'What the hell is going on?'</p>

  <p>Zheng remained calm, but he also knew that he was in trouble.</p>

  <p>Since the Shadow Bearing Sword was the sword of a powerful warrior in the Other Shore Realm, defeating it would definitely not be as simple as it looked.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Zheng felt something approaching quickly.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't see anything, he quickly reversed his soul in a moment of desperation, trying to avoid whatever was coming.</p>

  <p>However, his reflexes were too slow.</p>

  <p id="top_11"><a id="p14038" class="calibre2"></a>Fizz!</p>

  <p>Zheng felt something slash his soul.</p>

  <p>The pain he felt was several times stronger than any physical pain he had encountered.</p>

  <p>His soul trembled, but fortunately, the soul was not like a flesh body.</p>

  <p>When a soul was cut, it didn't bleed, and it was quick to heal. However, it would still bring harm to the owner of the soul.</p>

  <p>'It's a sword, ' Zheng exclaimed to himself.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't see, he had realized that it was a sword in soul form that had hurt him.</p>

  <p>When he had just gotten this answer in his heart, he once again felt the sword approaching.</p>

  <p>He wanted to dodge, but he had barely moved a finger when the sword slashed his soul once again.</p>

  <p>The sword was too fast for him! He felt a violent wave of pain wash over his soul.</p>

  <p>Although his soul had lost contact with his physical body, tiny beads of sweat trickled down his forehead.</p>

  <p>'I didn't expect that there would be such a powerful soul hidden in the Shadow Bearing Sword...'</p>

  <p>Zheng felt that something was amiss.</p>

  <p>Although his soul was far stronger than that of an ordinary True God, he was unable to counterattack in this darkness.</p>

  <p>He could do nothing but let the sword soul stab him again and again.</p>

  <p>If this continued, his soul would become weaker and weaker, and would be devoured by the sword soul sooner or later.</p>

  <p>'Why didn't Harper warn me?'</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered sourly, feeling depressed.</p>

  <p>The sword soul continued to fly and attack in the darkness.</p>

  <p>No matter how Zheng tried to escape from its attack, it always hit its target with full precision.</p>

  <p>'It can't go on like this.'</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng suddenly gave up dodging and waited for the sword soul to get close to him.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful this sword soul was, he wouldn't allow it to slaughter him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As he felt the sword soul approaching him again in the darkness, his eyes became cold, and the surface of his soul suddenly formed golden beams of light.</p>

  <p>Golden sword shadows began to constantly circle around the surface of his soul.</p>

  <p>The golden light broke the darkness and shone on Zheng, who finally saw a long, slender, and elegant sword in front of him.</p>

  <p>But the sword was actually a sword soul, so its surface was twisted with ripples.</p>

  <p>'That's the soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>Come on!'</p>

  <p>Seeing the sword soul fiercely spin toward him, Zheng shot the small golden swords on the surface of his soul toward it.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>A metallic sound resounded as the two collided with each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul attack was very powerful, but the sword soul had been cultivated with the Truth of Godly Way, so it wouldn't be defeated that easily.</p>

  <p>However, this time, Zheng used his soul attack to attack the sword soul continuously. At the same time, he kept retreating in order to avoid the sword soul's attack.</p>

  <p>The sword soul circled around Zheng's mind and once again shot toward him. It seemed as if it wouldn't give up until it cut Zheng's soul into pieces.</p>

  <p>This sword was actually so troublesome.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't expected that the sword that his mother had helped him obtain would bring him a fatal disaster.</p>

  <p>But when people were walking on the tightrope between life and death, a powerful force would burst out of them.</p>

  <p>"Ripping Consciousness!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng finally used the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had been using the Emotion Closing Godly Way in the swordsmanship a lot, the Emotion Closing Godly Way was actually related to the soul.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the base of the Emotion Closing Godly Way was the soul.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The sword light on his body intensified.</p>

  <p>As the sword soul approached him again, his soul emitted countless thick golden sword lights that surged toward the sword soul, forming a golden river.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The sword soul was soon washed away by the river and drowned in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>It was evident that the sword soul wanted to rush against the current, but it didn't take long for it to be carried away by the current instead.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were expressionless as he looked at the sword relying on the golden light he had emitted.</p>

  <p>This time, a cold soul and an expressionless sword soul confronted each other in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the sword soul moved and rushed toward Zheng again.</p>
