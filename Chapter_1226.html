  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing that Dorothea wanted to retaliate, Zheng hurriedly waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't!"</p>

  <p>The strength of the Spirit Supreme Realm martial artist was terrifying. If a Soul Sea Realm martial artist could destroy a mountain range with a wave of his hand, then her attack could probably destroy the entire Oracle City in an instant.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Those rays of light struck Zheng and Dorothea but did not cause any harm to them. Zheng's body was as strong as a sacred weapon, while Dorothea had her life vitality to protect her. These runes of third and fourth grades could not harm them.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Stellar Palace is an important place to the World Commercial Alliance. Whoever trespasses will become our enemy!" dozens of figures flashed and appeared. The man in the lead had a handsome face and bright eyes. He held a curved blade in his hand. He looked at Zheng with a surprised expression.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and shouted, "Owen!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! Zheng!" Owen sized up Zheng a few times and his eyes flashed with happiness. "You're back!"</p>

  <p>This was not the first time Zheng had left the Central Region, nor the longest that they hadn't had any news from him. Most people often thought he was dead. Although they were still worried about him going to the four divine kingdoms this time, they knew that he would return sooner or later. They just didn't expect him to come back so early.</p>

  <p>"But the Chaotic Ocean of Stars..."</p>

  <p>Every other week, the World Commercial Alliance would send back news from the far east of the Central Region. The storm in the sky of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars had been triggered a few months ago.</p>

  <p>The storm was so powerful that it could even stop the Soul Sea Realm martial artists. If martial artists from the Divine Kingdom Continent wanted to enter the Central Region, they had to wait for the storm to stop. The storm was the Central Region's natural barrier.</p>

  <p>Since the storm had already started, the Divine Kingdom Continent and the Central Region were completely isolated. So they wondered how Zheng was able to return.</p>

  <p>Looking at the curious expression on Owen's face, Zheng smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Why is the Heavenly Stellar Palace so heavily guarded?"</p>

  <p>Right now, the World Commercial Alliance was the most powerful in the Central Region, and Oracle City was the headquarters of the alliance. No one would dare to intrude the city.</p>

  <p>The alliance had dispatched many guards to protect the Heavenly Stellar Palace. It seemed like they were keeping guard against someone.</p>

  <p>Owen said, "Zheng, you've been away from the Central Region for half a year, so you don't know what has been happening here. Simon is doing everything he can to see the Heavenly Evil Sect rebuilt, so recently he is taking action. That is why our leaders gave the order to send more guards. I also received the order some time ago and came to guard the Heavenly Stellar Palace."</p>

  <p>"Simon?!" Zheng's eyebrows creased slightly.</p>

  <p>Back then, outside Oracle City, after Zheng killed Eddie, Simon ran away.</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng was too busy trying to save Yudie to deal with Simon.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was a vast place, so it was not easy to find someone.</p>

  <p>Since Eddie had been killed, Simon, who was weaker than Eddie, couldn't go around making waves, or he would be immediately recognized. So Zheng decided not to pursue him.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that he would be causing trouble this early.</p>

  <p>Unlike before, Zheng now possessed the will of the great world. As long as he was in this great world, no matter where Simon was hiding, Zheng would be able to find him in an instant.</p>

  <p>"I see..." Zheng sneered. "Let him live for a few more hours!"</p>

  <p>'Let him live a few more hours? What does he mean?' Owen thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew Zheng's talent was extraordinary. Half a year was enough for him to reach higher levels. But even if he reached the Life and Death Realm and could kill Simon effortlessly, he couldn't decide when Simon would die. After all, it would take a lot of effort and time to find Simon in the vast Central Region.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, several rays of light crossed the sky and landed right next to them.</p>

  <p>They were the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"You're back, finally!"</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes, Haber, and others all quickly descended into the Heavenly Stellar Palace with smiles on their faces. They knew that it might be difficult for others to obtain the life stones in the Divine Kingdom Continent, but they were quite sure that it would be an easy task for Zheng who was blessed with a great destiny.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and nodded in response. Actually, Zheng was eager to enter the Heavenly Stellar Palace, but people kept arriving one after another, and so he had to show his respect to them.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, who's the girl beside you?"</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes and the rest looked at Dorothea, wondering who she was.</p>

  <p>They were at the later stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Even if someone was to conceal his cultivation level purposely, they would still be able to tell which levels they were at. For instance, they could feel the difference between them and Miguel, and the other Soul Sea Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>But the girl in front of them didn't seem to be at the Life and Death Realm or the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>So they were quite surprised.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm was the highest realm that Dillon and the others knew.</p>

  <p>There were very few Life and Death Realm martial artists in the Central Region. Those who had reached the Life and Death Realm were considered the top martial artists on the continent. No one had reached the Soul Sea Realm in the history of the Central Region. Only the Divine Kingdom Continent on the opposite side of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars had Soul Sea Realm martial artists. They were the top powerhouses of the great world and the pillars of this world's strength.</p>

  <p>The three alliance leaders were unable to tell Dorothea's cultivation level, although they were very sure that she was not concealing it on purpose.</p>

  <p>They wondered what level she was at, and if she had surpassed Soul Sea Realm martial artists. According to the rules, such a powerful figure shouldn't have appeared.</p>

  <p>The three of them kept guessing. To them, everything Zheng did was too surprising. The powerhouses that he kept bringing were getting stronger and stronger. Last time, he brought a group of Life and Death Realm martial artists and several Soul Sea Realm martial artists. The girl with him this time seemed much stronger than those.</p>

  <p>When they were on their way to the Heavenly Stellar Palace, they spotted the Eight-diagram Wheel above their heads but they did not dare to get close to it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is one of my..." Zheng thought for a moment, not knowing how to introduce Dorothea. After all, his identity had not been confirmed by Dorothea and the others, so he didn't know whether or not they could be considered friends.</p>

  <p>Dorothea replied warmly, "Friends... I'm Zheng's friend."</p>

  <p>Dorothea seemed a little strange, but she was more polite than the people Zheng brought before. Hearing Dorothea's reply, Zheng nodded his head and said, "Mr. Shi, I'll be going in. I have the life stones with me."</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded heads, but no one followed Zheng in. They knew about his relationship with Yudie and wanted to give them privacy. Besides, the Heavenly Stellar Palace was considered a forbidden area in Oracle City. Other than Margaret and a few female servants, no one else was allowed to go in.</p>

  <p>Zheng went straight to the Heavenly Stellar Palace and Dorothea followed close behind him. There was already a servant girl waiting by the door, and seeing Zheng enter, she obediently said, "Mr. Luo, Miss Ning is listening to the zither in the garden behind the palace. Please follow me."</p>

  <p>"She's listening to the zither?" Zheng could not believe her words. "She's awake?"</p>

  <p>The day before, when Zheng had secretly checked on Yudie, she was still sleeping. Now she was listening to the zither.</p>

  <p>The servant girl smiled and said, "You will know soon enough."</p>

  <p>After they passed through the Heavenly Stellar Palace, they came to an open backyard that was filled with all kinds of flowers and grass. There was a clear pond at the side that was filled with pink lotus flowers. The backyard looked peaceful, but Zheng felt hundreds of defensive runes around.</p>

  <p>He smiled as the beautiful sound of zither floated into his ears.</p>

  <p>Not far away, he saw Yudie dressed in ice blue, lying on an elegant bed.</p>

  <p>Close to her, a girl in a purple dress played the zither with greatest skills.</p>

  <p>While plucking the strings with her fingers, her life vitality surrounded her, allowing her to play music beautifully.</p>

  <p>She was focused on playing her zither when she heard someone come behind her. Then she said to her maid expressionlessly, "Faye, bring the fresh flower tea over."</p>
