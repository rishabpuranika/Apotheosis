  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spirits City was an ancient city rich in history which included several hundreds of chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Whereas the City Guard House's opulence wouldn't be anything worth mentioning in the Source World, it was considered to be quite a rare sight on the Other Shore. Neither the Stage Four temples nor the Stage Thirteen strongholds could hold a candle to it.</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel race was known for its intelligence. Once they confirmed that the former city lord was killed, they wasted no time in allying with the Giants to eradicate the Dark Bear race once and for all.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't dare to steal any of the resources that were kept at the City Guard House upon successfully occupying it.</p>

  <p>They focused on their main goal? controlling the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Zheng and the Taiyi Heaven Palace he was representing wouldn't remain in Stage Fourteen. Therefore, there was no need for offending them.</p>

  <p>That was why the Guide Weasel race was willing to surrender the City Guard House to Luo Zheng with utmost sincerity.</p>

  <p>"This dress...it won't fit me."</p>

  <p>"Nor will this one..."</p>

  <p>"And this one..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge complained as she picked and chose from a pile of clothing. Ever since her trip to the Dark Region, she had always robed herself with light-formed attire that couldn't exactly be considered material. She wasn't like Luo Zheng whose vague shape could be barely recognized even if he was naked.</p>

  <p>Although she'd already become more skilled in controlling the Great Sanskrit Light and the garb she created for herself was enough to cover her decently, she always wanted to find a better solution.</p>

  <p>There were also some women of the Fragrant Butterfly race living in the City Guard House, and they had many clothes.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that they were too unsuitable and revealing for her taste. After taking her time going through her options, she finally gave up.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Princess Feng Ge! We'll ask the servants to tailor dresses for you immediately. It'll only take half a day!" a member of the Guide Weasel race offered before he hurriedly left to give orders.</p>

  <p>As she threw the revealing clothes onto the floor, Feng Ge walked out of the room and headed towards the backyard.</p>

  <p>There, a myriad of weapons was lined up in an orderly fashion on the ground.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng scanned through them, disappointment clouded his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically," he began to speak, "some of the races residing on the Other Shore descended from those ancient civilizations of the chaos. They must have brought with them their best treasures when they fled to the Other Shore. So what on earth are these useless scraps we've found here in Stage Fourteen?"</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's perspective, these were nothing but mere scraps of metal. The only ones that provided any real value were the Green Kylin Bows used by the mole crickets. Supposedly, these were specially made with carefully selected materials by the mole crickets.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng believed that there were many legendary weapons like the Soaring Snake Sword in the past. To his disappointment, he failed to find any of them in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Because the Guide Weasel race was indigenous to the Other Shore, they hardly knew anything about the chaos and so they couldn't answer any of Luo Zheng's questions.</p>

  <p>An Ear Mouse moved forward and answered on their behalf, "As far as I know, the legendary weapons were obtained only by the most powerful masters. Since they've gone on to the higher stages, it'd be impossible to keep them in Stage Fourteen."</p>

  <p>"That's right," another Ear Mouse agreed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded to confirm that he heard them. He never thought getting a decent sword in Stage Fourteen would be this difficult.</p>

  <p>As he leaned forward to pick up a thin sword to test its weight, Feng Ge arrived. He grinned at her before throwing the sword towards her.</p>

  <p>She swiftly caught and brandished it before snapping it in half with ease.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said with a smile across her face, "I guess that sword was too fragile for me to wield!"</p>

  <p>A look of disbelief fell on the faces of the Guide Weasels that witnessed this scene. 'Is she aware of the true extent of her power?' they thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>"Are we ever going to find swords that are good enough for us here at Stage Fourteen?" Feng Ge grumbled, sounding depressed.</p>

  <p>A member of the Guide Weasel race hesitated for a moment before saying,</p>

  <p>"In fact, the Riverside race are very famous weapon refiners who have forged many excellent weapons. However, they all moved to the Sky Water City a few hundred years ago..."</p>

  <p>"The Sky Water City... Isn't it the city of the Star Falcon race?" Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>He knew the Ghost Scorpion? along with the black bear? was asking for trouble under the order of the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>Both the Bearing race and the Jin Wu were determined on killing him, their hostility evident in their revenge which knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't feel worried at all. He suspected that it wouldn't be long before the members of the Star Falcon race themselves would arrive and bring all this chaos upon themselves.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. My friends are still waiting in the Source World. It's time for them to return to the Other Shore," Luo Zheng informed with a grin.</p>

  <p>The Land of Sword Grief was currently full of lower-ranked disciples who were panicking.</p>

  <p>Things were just fine for those on the second and third floors who usually stayed in the higher stages of the Other Shore and didn't need to return to Stage Fourteen so frequently.</p>

  <p>But it was a different story for the disciples on the first floor. Most of them just started their adventure in the Desire World. Their stronghold in Stage Fourteen served as a gathering place just like the Stage Four temples.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, with the new disciples' arrival at Stage Fourteen, a massive conflict between them and the Other Shore creatures came.</p>

  <p>"It's all the newcomers' fault!"</p>

  <p>"Why did they have to provoke the Other Shore creatures when they didn't have the power? Now I'll have to remain in Stage Fifteen. I can't go back to the stronghold now!"</p>

  <p>"You've got better luck than me. I was right outside a Stage Fourteen temple when I left. How will I be able to return to the Myriad Spirits City? I'll certainly be arrested once I arrive at the city gate?"</p>

  <p>"Don't blame the other new disciples. We all know that Luo Zheng and Princess Feng Ge are the ones to blame. It's them you should be confronting regarding all of this? if you have the guts, that is."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached the top of the Ranking Stone on the first floor in only one day.</p>

  <p>None of these people would have the ability to challenge him. As for Feng Ge, who would dare to confront her, considering her high status?</p>

  <p>"I just want to know how those two are doing," Abdul sighed.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been angry with the two of them, but Luo Zheng and Feng Ge were still members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Though they had physical bodies on the Other Shore, Abdul couldn't help but wonder if they were strong enough to face the creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Many of the new disciples stood aside and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Soon, the deep and heavy feeling in the room became too much to bear.</p>

  <p>Chaim finally gave in and exclaimed, "Stop worrying! Have some faith in Luo Zheng and Princess Feng Ge, will you?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. Princess Feng Ge can also be considered an Other Shore creature, right? I'm sure defeating them will be no problem for her," Milo added in agreement with Chaim.</p>

  <p>Abdul sneered and said, "Before the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was banned, taking on the physical form while roaming the Other Shore was considered common. However, hardly anyone could defeat those Other Shore creatures as soon as they reached Stage Fourteen!"</p>

  <p>It was no easy feat to improve one's physical form on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was never a wise decision for any new-comer in Stage Fourteen to become an enemy of the Other Shore creatures. It wasn't difficult to kill an ordinary Tail Insect, but the consequences would be unimaginably terrible once the Ghost Scorpion was involved.</p>
