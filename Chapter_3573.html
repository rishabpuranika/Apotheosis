  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng so unaffected, the old man's rage only flared up further.</p>

  <p>With a hot temper, he would never let Luo Zheng get away easily!</p>

  <p>ROAR!</p>

  <p>The old man moved to grab Luo Zheng, his clawed hand launching a huge blue wolf head straight at him.</p>

  <p>But just as the snarling phantom was about to snap at its target, Eastern Emperor Taiyi raised his hand, making it disappear in thin air.</p>

  <p>The old man turned to look at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, surprised at the interruption.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head. "Pearce, calm down. Luo Zheng is stubborn. It would do no good to force him to stay."</p>

  <p>"Humph! He was offered a rare chance only so few are blessed with over generations! Yet, he showed no gratitude and even walked out arrogantly!</p>

  <p>How can I just stand for it?" Pearce ranted angrily.</p>

  <p>A hint of helplessness dimmed Flamine's beautiful eyes. "It's all my fault. I just arranged everything without considering Luo Zheng's feelings," she said guiltily.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Flamine deemed her daughter the best girl in the world. It never occurred to her any man would refuse her.</p>

  <p>Flamine never expected Luo Zheng would react so defensively to keep his principal wife.</p>

  <p>Flamine turned to look at Feng Ge apologetically. She felt sorry for her daughter the most.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had changed so much around Luo Zheng, her character growing for the better. It had made Flamine so happy.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge must feel devastated right about now.</p>

  <p>But to Flamine's surprise, Feng Ge's expression remained neutral. Feng Ge returned her mother's stare. "He's probably headed for the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. I'll go and have a look."</p>

  <p>With these words, Feng Ge strode out the Supreme Dragon Hall and headed for the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.</p>

  <p>In the Fire Bearing Hall of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, Yudie, Margaret, Xun, Nelly, and Liusu sat cross-legged on the floor. A burning red chain hung above their heads, emitting waves of scorching heat.</p>

  <p>This was the Soul Fire Swirl, a unique cultivation method in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.</p>

  <p>Xun, Nelly and Liusu had made great progress with their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Yudie and Margaret, meanwhile, had been here for only a month, so they had some ways to go.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie cherished this opportunity very much. She knew she would never catch up with Luo Zheng, but she didn't want to lag too far behind in terms of cultivation. She took all her training thus far very seriously.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Margaret was purposefully proceeding slowly.</p>

  <p>As she sat, she moved her hands over her abdomen. Streaks of purple light gathered around her belly, which had started to swell.</p>

  <p>Over the years, only Yudie, among all Luo Zheng's women, had borne him a child.</p>

  <p>This had made Margaret anxious, but she couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Last time Luo Zheng had returned from the Chaotic Source World, he had stayed in the independent courtyard house for days. About two months after Luo Zheng left for the Land of Sword Grief, Margaret had discovered the good news within her.</p>

  <p>Because it hadn't been that long, the change in her body wasn't noticeable yet. Margaret decided to keep it a secret for now.</p>

  <p>Just as Margaret touched her belly, Luo Zheng stepped into the Fire Bearing Hall.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Yudie and his other partners were safe and sound, he was slightly relieved. Although he didn't think Flamine would do anything to harm them, he had still gotten worried when she mentioned Yudie.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's eyes fell on Margaret, she was lost in thought and hadn't noticed his arrival. But he immediately sensed the change in her. He walked quickly up to her, his face shining with joy. "Margaret, are you...?"</p>

  <p>Margaret hadn't been expecting Luo Zheng. But now seeing Luo Zheng apparently wise to her pregnancy, a shy smile blossomed on her lips. "After I came to the Phoenix Palace, I couldn't leave as I wished, so I didn't know how to tell you. I'm sorry," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Upon discovering she was pregnant, Margaret had wanted to inform Luo Zheng immediately.</p>

  <p>However, as she was new to the Phoenix Palace and had no servants to order to relay the message, she could only wait for Luo Zheng's return and protect the growing baby in her womb.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden presence here was a pleasant surprise.</p>

  <p>Although Margaret lowered her voice, Yudie still overheard everything.</p>

  <p>"You should have told me you are pregnant! You shouldn't have subjected yourself to the Soul Fire Swirl in your condition," Yudie said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>Margaret scoffed at that. "Why would I tell you first?"</p>

  <p>Although she and Yudie had been on good terms for a long time now, she wanted to share the news with Luo Zheng first. It would have been awkward to tell Yudie, of all people.</p>

  <p>"But Margaret, it is dangerous to cultivate here while you're pregnant.</p>

  <p>Think of the child. You cannot be rash like this. You should have informed them of your condition," Luo Zheng admonished.</p>

  <p>Margaret nodded at that, humbled. "You're right. I'm sorry." For the first time, Margaret wasn't angered at being admonished. She had rarely gotten angry since she got pregnant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently touched Margaret's head and lifted the red chain, removing the Soul Fire Swirl for her.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Yudie. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi summoned me today."</p>

  <p>Yudie dropped her eyes. She knew what Luo Zheng would say next.</p>

  <p>"How could you just decide things on your own like that?" Luo Zheng pressed, staring at Yudie.</p>

  <p>Yudie lowered her head. "Lady Flamine talked to me. If you marry Feng Ge, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would always be there to help you. It would be good for you. I'll be fine. It makes little difference to me."</p>

  <p>Flamine had actually met with Yudie three times. She had been upfront about her purpose and had patiently explained the situation in detail.</p>

  <p>Yudie was smart enough to recognize Flamine's painstaking efforts.</p>

  <p>She also admired Flamine's honesty.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng became the husband of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's princess, it would be of great benefit to him. That was why Yudie gave her consent to Flamine.</p>

  <p>"I just knew it." Luo Zheng sighed. Even before talking to Yudie, he had already guessed she would say something like this.</p>

  <p>"So, did you agree to the marriage?" Yudie asked, staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The practical side of her thought was Luo Zheng should seize the opportunity. But a part of her was grieving at the thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "No."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's answer, Yudie felt relieved and dismayed at the same time.</p>

  <p>Honestly, she couldn't understand herself, at times.</p>

  <p>"There are just some things that can't and shouldn't be changed," Luo Zheng said firmly.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Yudie's face. At this moment, she exuded a kind of quiet charm. A split second later, however, she gave Luo Zheng a sly look. "Do you like Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>Yudie didn't know Feng Ge that much, unlike Xun, Liusu, and Nelly who constantly interacted with Feng Ge and even regarded her as their master.</p>

  <p>"I also want to know the answer."</p>

  <p>A faint voice came from the entrance of the Fire Bearing Hall. It was Feng Ge.</p>
