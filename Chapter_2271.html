  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was clear to everyone that the anonymous man didn't care one bit about the three supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that he had a strong grudge against Ling Shuang and was trying to irritate her on purpose.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang, on the other hand, who had noticed his partiality for Han Liusu, was now in a bad mood.</p>

  <p>"But... I don't think that's a good idea." Han Liusu was surprised at this, having not expected what was happening.</p>

  <p>"I will accept your challenge if you will accept my condition," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Han Liusu said, her lips curving into a lovely grin and eyes wandering to Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Liusu's mocking was the last straw for Ling Shuang and her irritation showed on her countenance. Luo Zheng's attitude towards her was nothing more than provocation and insult. But she knew that it was improper for her to vent her anger at Han Liusu. So she rushed over to Luo Luo Zheng and demanded an answer from him, "What is the meaning of all this discrimination against me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely raised his head and gazed into the distance, not bothering to pay any attention to Ling Shuang. He just pointed into the distance and said,</p>

  <p>"The battle begins!"</p>

  <p>In the distance, the shadow of a slender figure lengthened as it moved in the blood red wilderness. It belonged to a petite woman.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in a blood red robe and walked slowly along the vast wilderness. A strong killing intent emanated off of her. Luo Luo Zheng could feel the threat of death across the vast distance that separated them.</p>

  <p>Her killing intent was like a sharp knife, pressing against everyone's hearts. With just a glance, the knife could pierce through their hearts and take their lives.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle Mu. So this is the Mu Ning of a consummate True God?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Joy was a Demi-holy Being and had an Mu Ning that was completely different from that of Rachelle's. Luo Luo Zheng didn't think that Joy's Mu Ning was more powerful than Rachelle's.</p>

  <p>"It's Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>"What a strong killing intent! Her cultivation of the Murdering Godly Way is already perfect and it is said that she has also grasped three other theurgies beyond the Murdering Godly Way. It seems that she has made a lot more progress!"</p>

  <p>"But will she still be defeated brutally by Harold this year?"</p>

  <p>Since the destruction of the Luo Clan's Floating Island, Harold challenged Rachelle every year, and every year, he would ruthlessly defeat her.</p>

  <p>It was strange that Rachelle never turned down Harold's challenges when she had the option. According to the rules, consummate True Gods only needed to complete one open battle before the new ranking was determined. She only needed to challenge another consummate True God before Harold could challenge her.</p>

  <p>But Rachelle kept fighting him and continued to lose against him. It looked like she was willing to take him up on his challenge every single time. This resulted in a rumor on the Floating Islands that this precious girl of the Mu Clan was a born masochist. She would be happy even if Harold cruelly defeated her every single time.</p>

  <p>"That's my elder sister!" Ling Shuang said, smiling proudly as she glanced at Luo Luo Zheng to see if he had registered what she had said.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was a dignified True God but she was still a woman. Minutes ago, Luo Zheng's obvious partiality towards Han Liusu had made her madly jealous, and now, she wanted to prove herself to him. She was proud of her sister and took this opportunity to remind him that Rachelle was her older sister.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't respond to her. Instead, his gaze wandered over to the other side where a young man stood opposite Rachelle. Harold.</p>

  <p>"So I finally see you again," Luo Luo Zheng muttered as he stared at Harold.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Ling Shuang asked, trying to pay close attention to the anonymous man beside her.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't talking to you!" Luo Luo Zheng snapped at her.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Ling Shuang said, her eyebrows rising angrily. She had never before met someone who dared ignore her to this extent. She was so angry, she could swallow him whole.</p>

  <p>A big smile adorned Liusu's face. She didn't know if the anonymous man was Luo Luo Zheng, but she was happy that he had helped her vent her frustration on Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>In contrast to Rachelle, who was looking murderous, Harold remained calm.</p>

  <p>He looked unruffled, as if nothing in the world could ever affect him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had felt this kind of Mu Ning when he had first seen Harold. At the time, he hadn't understood how powerful it was. He had only gotten the vague impression that the entire great world was afraid of him.</p>

  <p>"Harold looks so mysterious all the time!"</p>

  <p>"He has taken control of the Everest Spirit Mountain. It is said that even the Holy Beings couldn't defeat him. Rachelle will be a piece of cake for him."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Don't you know that the power of the Everest Spirit Mountain cannot be used inside the Jade Wall of Legends?</p>

  <p>Besides, Rachelle has made great progress. Everyone has watched her open battle with Walton. It is said that she still retains her strength!"</p>

  <p>Other than the two people in the distance, Luo Zheng's attention was also paid on what the others were talking about. He was unfamiliar with the divine land, and he needed to get as much information as he could.</p>

  <p>It was then that Harold spoke. "Pleasure to meet you again. This is the sixteenth battle between us, if I remember correctly."</p>

  <p>Prior to this, Rachelle had lost to him fifteen times.</p>

  <p>It was hard for others to imagine that with her level of arrogance, Rachelle had managed to endure so many failures.</p>

  <p>"I will not lose to you this time," she said calmly.</p>

  <p>Harold smiled noncommittally and said, "Every time I earn my points from you, I'm overwhelmed with guilt."</p>

  <p>The True Gods began to whisper among themselves at Harold's words.</p>

  <p>"What an obvious lie!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone knows that he has a terrible relationship with the Mu Clan."</p>

  <p>"In fact, the Luo Clan has been completely destroyed, and there is no possibility for them to rise again. Then why is Harold so persistent?"</p>

  <p>Many people thought that Harold was an outstanding warrior.</p>

  <p>If he gave up acting against the Mu Clan and the Hall of Holy Beings, and gave up rescuing his master Mike, he might even be given the title of a Holy Being in the future. Or he could even establish his own clan on a Floating Island above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"No possibility to rise again, right?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered, rage flashing in his eyes. He clenched his fists as the image of the devastated Floating Island of the Luo Clan crossed his mind, and fury rose from the bottom of his heart. One day, he would revitalize their Floating Island and look down upon every large clan that was present.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was just a nobody who needed to hide his name. Any large clan was a great force that remained beyond his reach. He still needed to hide himself well and move forward carefully.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to feel sorry," Rachelle said nonchalantly. "I will take back all the points."</p>

  <p>Saying thus, she raised her hands, two rays of light flashing around them before two weapons appeared in her hands. In her right hand was a short silver machete with an arc-shaped blade. The thick, broad blade was emitting a faint blue light, and inside the blue light, was a narrow line of golden Sanskrit. In her left hand was a short sword that looked rather ordinary.</p>

  <p>Harold leisurely put his left hand behind his back, while the fingers of his right hand continued to move, as if he was calculating something. He didn't pull out any weapon but merely said, "Let's begin."</p>

  <p>Rachelle's eyes flashed. She moved towards Harold in one big stride and the redness in her eyes spread along her cheeks to the back, leaving two blood-red tracks behind her.</p>

  <p>She was incredibly fast!</p>

  <p>Rachelle quickly approached him, as if she was moving like the wind.</p>

  <p>She silently drew an arc in the air with the short machete in her right hand.</p>

  <p>Harold was rigid as wood and moved stiffly but numbly to the other side, easily avoiding the slash. The arc in the air began to expand, and before long, it had grown into one that was a thousand feet wide. Once it had fully activated the energy contained within it, it created a wave of blood red power that stretched to the end of the wilderness before dissipating.</p>

  <p>"This slash alone has such great power! The entire power of this attack had condensed in her machete from the very beginning!" Luo Luo Zheng said wondrously, stunned as he watched the monstrous wave of blood-red power. This was the first time he had watched a battle between two consummate True Gods.</p>
