  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng entered the building with Michael Mo, trailing behind him. Once he was inside, it dawned on him how completely different the inside was from the outside. The branch of the World Commercial Alliance was luxuriously decorated. There wasn't a single area that looked ordinary inside. 'This place is exquisite, ' Zheng thought, feeling impressed.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance was a commercial organization and had survived for many years. In spite of its current prosperity, it was believed that it might decline one day. Thus, it clearly had to keep a low profile if it wished to do high profile jobs.</p>

  <p>For the World Commercial Alliance, Zheng was an important guest, so Michael welcomed him in person. To be sure, such a warm welcome was given to Zheng because they learnt about his identity.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Lasseter had submitted a portfolio containing all seven rune works of Zheng. The prolific works left everyone, including those people from the headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance, shocked. All members of this alliance were well aware about the value of a runic expert who was excellent at Perfect Brushwork. Therefore, the World Commercial Alliance had decided to ingratiate Zheng at all costs.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was a member of Cloud Hall, the World Commercial Alliance generally didn't get itself involved in the struggles among sects.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was a runic expert, it was concluded that there would be a lot of room for cooperation with this guy.</p>

  <p>After Zheng took a seat, Michael clapped his hands. In a blink of an eye, two beautiful maids appeared and served them tea. The tea brought a wonderful fragrance to the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, do you come here to purchase materials or to sell runes?" Michael asked, without wasting anytime. He wanted to get to the gist of the matter.</p>

  <p>"I do sell runes. But my visit here is mainly made to buy certain materials and some news," Zheng replied curtly.</p>

  <p>Michael nodded, taking out a square nameplate. The entire nameplate was inlaid with gold and jade. In the center of the nameplate, "Zheng Luo" was inscribed. The nameplate looked really exquisite. "Zheng, our sub-alliance has exclusively made this nameplate for you. With this nameplate, you are entitled to get discounts from the branch of the World Commercial Alliance located in any area. You are now considered as our most respectful customer. In addition, we can sell our materials to you at a 20% discount. Moreover, we intend to buy your runes at a price a little higher than the market price,"</p>

  <p>Michael stated in a professional manner. Zheng reached for that exquisite nameplate as a smile crept on his face. 'People of the World Commercial Alliance are really astute! They apparently have made this nameplate for quite a long period. People here seem to be really generous. They have offered me such a privilege without imposing any condition!' he thought.</p>

  <p>People of the World Commercial Alliance were not fools and everyone knew that. Moreover, no merchant would sell hens on a rainy day. It was beyond doubt that they expected something in return from Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng couldn't help but feel impressed with their conducts which were so pleasing.</p>

  <p>'It is always a pleasure to deal with clever people. Besides, I am really on the lookout for a channel to sell divine textures. Undoubtedly, the World Commercial Alliance is the best option for me, ' Zheng thought excitedly.</p>

  <p>He was unable to conceal his gratification.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, Zheng handed several of his divine textures to Michael.</p>

  <p>"These are one star runes, but they are as effective as ordinary two-star runes once they are triggered..." Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>Michael took the runes from Zheng. As he analyzed different routes of the runes, he unconsciously nodded his head in approval. As soon as Michael saw Zheng's mediation runes the first time, he figured that they belonged to a different school from the ordinary ones. These runes followed totally different routes which couldn't be drawn without professional help no matter how gifted he was.</p>

  <p>Now Michael had verified what he thought was true. Yet, what he didn't know was that the runes that Zheng had drawn were actually divine textures.</p>

  <p>Michael casually released his life vitality and lit up the textures. At the sight of bold and perfect strokes on the textures, his face beamed with a bright smile. Judging from the novel routes and Perfect Brushwork, Michael concluded that he could sell the textures at a good price. Thus, he handed the textures over to the servants beside him and asked them to have the textures evaluated.</p>

  <p>In actuality, Michael had no interest in one star or two-star runes. But he was hopeful that Zheng would be capable of drawing four-star, five-star and even six-star runes as he grew up. 'This is going to be awesome, '</p>

  <p>Michael thought with his heart brimming with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, apart from selling runes, do you need to buy any materials?"</p>

  <p>Michael questioned casually.</p>

  <p>He was very confident that he could get all materials within the Central Region. In consideration of Zheng's current cultivation, he assumed that the materials Zheng required wouldn't be beyond his reach. Hence, Michael was hell-bent on helping Zheng get the materials that would be handy for him.</p>

  <p>Upon Michael's questioning, Zheng nodded and responded, "I want to buy two bottles of celestial soul liquid, a purple thunder bamboo plant which has survived for more than 5, 000 years, a withered ginseng plant which has survived for 1, 000 years, and..."</p>

  <p>Michael gaped at Zheng anxiously as he heard his requests.</p>

  <p>All these materials mentioned by Zheng were top-grade materials. Both the celestial soul liquid and the purple thunder bamboo were known as rare treasures, which were occasionally seen over several years or perhaps even decades. Most of the time, the World Commercial Alliance would sell these materials as soon as they got hold of them. There was always a huge demand for them. In the Central Region, the elderly people especially dreamed of owning these materials.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, our commercial alliance would be more than willing to sell these materials to you if they had been available. However, they are too precious and rarely seen. It takes over a decade to get a glimpse of them.</p>

  <p>Hence, I can only assure you that I will inform you as soon as I get any news about these materials," Michael explained with a rueful smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded without any tinge of suspicion. In truth, he had already known that these things were too rare to be collected so easily. Hence, he had come to the alliance for the major purpose of getting some news.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could speak, Michael added, "Recently, someone reported a piece of news about purple thunder bamboo to us."</p>

  <p>"What's the price for the news?" asked Zheng curiously.</p>

  <p>Michael smiled and replied, "Zheng, the news is not a secret, so it is of no great value. To celebrate having a friend like you, I will privately offer you the news as a gift." As soon as Michael finished, he burnt a message rune. A short while later, someone came with a map. Michael reached for the map and then handed it over to Zheng while saying, "But Zheng, I don't suggest that you look for the purple thunder bamboo by yourself."</p>

  <p>A good many warriors would do anything to get these rare treasures. But the task was not as easy as it seemed. Moon Mountain was the place where the precious treasures were kept. And it happened to be an unsafe and dangerous place.</p>

  <p>In Michael's eyes, Zheng was skilled at Perfect Brushwork and incomparably gifted in drawing runes. But in terms of strength, Zheng had only reached the nature level, so his cultivation achievement was far from enough for going to the mountain. 'Getting the rare treasures is not something he can do, ' Michael thought and shook his head.</p>

  <p>However, he had no say in it. It was up to Zheng if he would go or not. But Michael thought it was his responsibility to warn him. Naturally, it was impossible for him to stop Zheng. Once Zheng left, Michael's face contorted with a frown. "Are elders of Cloud Hall so silly? They permitted Zheng to freely stroll outside the Cloud Hall as he wished?"</p>

  <p>Other sects would rear Zheng like legendary beasts if they found that Zheng was such an excellent runic expert. They would be in constant fear that some mishap would happen to him. Hence, Michael was a little puzzled to realize that Cloud Hall let Zheng live the life as he pleased.</p>

  <p>Then one month had passed. All areas which were 5, 000 miles away from Cloudy City in the southwest and outside the West Mountain Pass were categorized as Western Region, where local customs and practices differed from those in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Zheng was dashing along the official road to Western Region. It was not because he enjoyed walking there on foot. Instead, he was compelled to do it. His flying chariot brutally crashed half a month ago. And in the Western Region, it was extremely difficult to buy a galloping horse.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had no choice but to tire himself by walking on foot.</p>

  <p>He sprinted all the way towards the west, feeling all his energy getting drained out of his body.</p>

  <p>The Western Region was a vast territory with sparse population. In general, no one was seen over hundreds of miles. Now, a small town came into Zheng's view. Beside the road, a small plaque was set up. On that plaque, Everest Town could be seen.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng arrived at this town, he rushed into a tavern.</p>

  <p>A waiter of the tavern, wearing a braid, came over to Zheng. He behaved cordially and spoke with a rather strong accent, "Sir, this way please!"</p>

  <p>Feeling a little out of breath, Zheng nodded and followed the waiter's lead upstairs.</p>

  <p>As soon as he reached the second floor, he felt something was amiss. To begin with, there were very few guests. And when he made his way, he found all waiters and the manager were looking in his direction. He felt that they had malicious intentions.</p>

  <p>'Why are they glancing in my direction? What do they want?' he wondered, feeling bewildered. However, once he sat down, his thoughts went back to food. His stomach was growling with hunger.</p>

  <p>The waiter with the braid came over to Zheng with a menu. In the most friendly tone, he asked, "Sir, these are special dishes at our tavern.</p>

  <p>Would you like to have some?"</p>

  <p>Zheng swiftly scanned through the menu. Placing the menu back, he nodded and said, "Yes, go ahead and serve me all special dishes!"</p>

  <p>Traveling outside, Zheng was open to experimenting different tastes. He was never hypercritical about wine, meat or food.</p>

  <p>The waiter shortly replied, looked back and made a gesture to the manager. Afterwards, the waiters exchanged glances with each other.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be communicating with each other using their eyes.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng sat calmly, not bothering to ask what the matter was. But in the pit of his stomach, he had a bad feeling. He assumed that his meal was going to be a disappointing one.</p>
