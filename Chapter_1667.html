<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>When Zheng pulled out the Saint Killing Spear, the faces of the other martial artists drained of color.</p>

  <p>The spear was one of the top three supreme divine weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet. It was the symbol of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>'Isn't Zheng a sword cultivator?</p>

  <p>Why did he switch to use a spear so suddenly?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't stayed in the Upper World for long. But the fact that he was in the Humanity Alliance had already been dug up by many people, as was his performance in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>The Humanity Alliance had probably released the news on purpose, with the intention of proving to the other races in the universe that Zheng was a part of their Alliance.</p>

  <p>But Zheng did not care what others thought of him.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear had been returned to his space ring after one thrust.</p>

  <p>Every other living being in the universe had heard of Zheng's name, but this was the first time they were seeing him in action.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng had killed Norvin, an ogre ace talent. But the Saint Killing Spear was so famous that many would think he had won because of the spear and not because of his true strength.</p>

  <p>Zheng went back into the air and stepped onto a black stone. Close by, a white stone began to float towards him.</p>

  <p>On this white stone stood a slender woman from the Demon Night. Quiet and elegant, she was a little less spirited compared to the other women, but also more dignified.</p>

  <p>As she floated up to Zheng, she stared at him and said, "Friend, please return the Saint Killing Spear to us. It belongs to us and is the Demon Night's most sacred item."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Saint Killing Spear was extremely important to the Demon Night. But the problem was that they were in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear he was using was not the original spear itself but just a projection. But he knew that there was a high chance that he could take the spear out of the Illusion Battlefield as he had marked it in the Hall of Causality. He wanted to surprise Xun when he returned to her side.</p>

  <p>And now, this woman wanted him to return it! How could he do that?</p>

  <p>So he merely smiled as he stared at her. "I'm supposed to return this spear to you just because it is a sacred item of your race?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Of course."</p>

  <p>"Are you an idiot? This Saint Killing Spear is only a projection, not the real Spear," Margaret intervened, unable to hold it in any longer. She had moved her stone and had blocked the path of the woman from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled faintly and said, "Of course I know that. But I also know that he has been to the Hall of Causality and that the Saint Killing Spear has already been imprinted with a mark. So it can be taken out of the Illusion Battlefield." She then turned to Zheng. "Do you really plan to give it to Xun?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>He realized that the woman was reacting rather strangely.</p>

  <p>People of the Demon Night addressed their three queens as "my queen" if and when they mentioned them.</p>

  <p>Even Xun's enemies in the Demon Night respectfully addressed her that way.</p>

  <p>But this woman was calling Xun by her name!</p>

  <p>Who was she?</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled coldly as he said, "I got this spear from the hands of a Demon Night martial practitioner. So of course I should hand it over to Xun. You want me to give it to you? Who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>The woman from the Demon Night wasn't angry at Zheng's words. Instead, she stared at him, and a faint smile snaked its way onto her face. "We will fight each other sooner or later, and you will return it to me then."</p>

  <p>And then, on the white stone, she floated over to the other side.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused. 'Just who is this woman? What does she mean?'</p>

  <p>"She is a Godly Genius of Demon Night. Her name is Shania," a human ace talent told Zheng.</p>

  <p>Shania?</p>

  <p>Zheng had never heard of her before.</p>

  <p>However, since he had never been to the supreme worlds controlled by the Demon Night before, it was normal for him not to know much about their talents.</p>

  <p>The human martial artist continued, "Shania is very strange. I have never heard of her before. Her Mahayana Lotus Flower has fully bloomed. It feels like she emerged from nowhere."</p>

  <p>"Came out of nowhere?" Zheng stared at Shania's receding figure, his brows knitting together.</p>

  <p>"The cultivation of a Godly Genius requires a huge expenditure of wealth and resources. No one has ever heard of the existence of a Godly Genius like her in the Demon Night. And now suddenly she exists? She has of course appeared out of nowhere." The human ace talent knew quite a bit about this, and he even helped Zheng analyze this.</p>

  <p>'Whoever she is, she intends to force me to return the Saint Killing Spear to her.</p>

  <p>It's not going to happen.</p>

  <p>The competition on the Heaven Earth Board won't be life-threatening.</p>

  <p>What does she want to use to force me to give her the spear?' Zheng thought, unable to figure it out.</p>

  <p>As he thought, his gaze fell on Shania. This was most likely related to Xun. It was best to observe the situation quietly.</p>

  <p>The gigantic hand was still putting stones onto the Heaven Earth Board and the battle continued to unfold.</p>

  <p>Three hundred ace talents was a small number, but it still took a great deal of time to finish the matches one at a time.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had fought on the board, he had never gotten another chance to fight. On the other hand, Margaret had battled twice, and she had won both times using the Purple River Sword Array, which had been enough while she handled an ace talent.</p>

  <p>It was the thirty-fourth round when one of the three hundred martial artists was finally eliminated.</p>

  <p>All the black stones on the board had now surrounded the white one, causing the martial artist on the white stone to fight with all his might. If he won, he could still stay on the Heaven Earth Board, and if he lost, he would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>But he had still been defeated and became the first among the three hundred warriors to be eliminated.</p>

  <p>And even though Norvin had faced continuous defeats, he escaped elimination because the stone he had stepped on wasn't being trapped.</p>

  <p>This meant that if his stone wasn't cornered when placed on the board, he wouldn't be eliminated irrespective of the outcome of the match.</p>

  <p>But if a warrior's stone was blocked on the board, he HAD to fight for his life, because if he lost, he would be eliminated.</p>
