<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>For Geoffrey, it wasn't difficult to decipher the six golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>He studied the boy and the long-haired man in front of him. The both of them looked sharp and extraordinary, and Geoffrey knew for a fact that they were the two other disciples of his father's master, so he really didn't mind wringing them for some treasures.</p>

  <p>"No problem!" Without hesitation, Hallet drew a palm-sized bottle gourd from his space ring and showed it to Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>It was a purple-golden color and had two green leaves by the end of its vine.</p>

  <p>"What does it do?" Geoffrey asked curiously. He was very excited to see the bottle gourd, but he tried his best to appear nonchalant.</p>

  <p>"This is called the Purple-golden Creating Gourd. It has a world inside it, and it can make you double the result with half the effort when you are cultivating," said Hallet. "Since you can't leave the fairy palace, you must be very bored. The world within the Purple-golden Creating Gourd is much larger than a great world and there are countless secondary creatures in it. Moreover, there is a large lake in the Purple-golden Creating Gourd filled with erosive water. If you drive the Purple-golden Creating Gourd to absorb an ordinary low-rank True God into it, they would be incinerated in an instant! More importantly, you can use this Purple-golden Creating Gourd without refining it."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was sold.</p>

  <p>He truly was bored staying in the fairy palace all the time. He was young and he wanted to wander around and explore the world around him. He lived a very comfortable life, yes, but staying in the fairy palace was just as boring as being in prison.</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey wanted the Purple-golden Creating Gourd badly, he schooled his face to not show his excitement. "This Purple-golden Creating Gourd is very common. Do you have any other treasures?"</p>

  <p>But Hallet was a smart man.</p>

  <p>When he heard this, he put the gourd back into his space ring and sniffed, "Forget it! It's okay if you don't like it."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's eyes widened. "No, please don't! Deal!" Then his eyes fell on Augustus, who just struggled to his feet. "But there are two of you.</p>

  <p>You're the only one who can see my translation."</p>

  <p>Hallet turned to Augustus and smirked. "You have a lot of scrap metals, don't you? Pick one for this little boy."</p>

  <p>"I don't accept scrap metals!" Geoffrey huffed.</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to him. They are not scrap metals!"</p>

  <p>Augustus said unhappily before giving Geoffrey a toothy grin. "Well, I'm also very generous. I'll give you a puppet for combat!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as he patted his pocket, a brown light flashed and a ten feet tall humanoid puppet appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>The puppet's bronze body glinted under the light. It looked like it had been aged for a long time and its body gave off the feeling of extreme power.</p>

  <p>"This puppet looks amazing!"</p>

  <p>It looked amazing, indeed. Even Zheng felt a bit jealous as soon as he saw it. He wanted one too.</p>

  <p>"Bromley has mastered the best puppet techniques, and his disciple has mastered them as well!" exclaimed Joy excitedly, admiration swimming in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Bromley was a miracle in the eyes of many Holy Beings. He was almost omnipotent in pill and weapon refining, and he had no difficulty in doing pretty much anything. Plus, his attainments in puppet refining were also profound.</p>

  <p>Augustus' heart swelled when he heard her praise. "Master Joy, one doesn't need to become its master to use it. Its combat strength is equivalent to a mid-rank True God's. I have many other powerful puppets. Do you want to see them?"</p>

  <p>"Really?" Joy asked with great interest.</p>

  <p>"Please don't, please don't..." Hallet interrupted when he heard Augustus' offer, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>When Augustus patted his pocket again, streaks of light shot out of it.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Puppets of different shapes filled the side hall one by one, and more puppets appeared in the yard in front of the main hall of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>There were more than a thousand puppets surrounding them.</p>

  <p>"Not again..." Hallet muttered helplessly.</p>

  <p>"These puppets are so powerful!" Yudie's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>Even Xun, who was a world lord, was shocked at the sight of the powerful puppets.</p>

  <p>Each of these seemingly silly puppets was intimidating and could easily tear her apart.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but admire Hallet, Augustus and the woman called Joy.</p>

  <p>They were all extremely powerful warriors!</p>

  <p>Augustus lazily patted a blue-golden puppet warrior by its side. "This puppet is called Laird. Even if it meets a consummate True God, it has the power to fight. It has super speed..."</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Zheng and others were also flabbergasted upon hearing that. Augustus' puppet techniques were indeed supreme in the divine land. As he took out all the puppets, even some consummate True Gods would find it hard to deal with them.</p>

  <p>But soon after, they understood why Hallet was trying to stop Augustus.</p>

  <p>This guy seemed to be in a state of intoxication after he released the puppets. He introduced the puppets one after the other in detail!</p>

  <p>If Augustus were to introduce all of the puppets in detail, it'd be two days before he finished.</p>

  <p>"Enough!"</p>

  <p>Hallet shouted, unable to bear it anymore. "Put these puppets away!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He lifted the fishing rod in his hand, and an invisible line spread a terrible wave.</p>

  <p>Knowing well that his words fell on deaf ears, Hallet got ready to fight Augustus again.</p>

  <p>Augustus, on the other hand, looked at the puppets sadly. It had been a long time since he had the opportunity to show his puppets to others.</p>

  <p>How he wished he could show off in front of Zheng!</p>

  <p>Scowling at Hallet, Augustus reluctantly patted his waist. In an instant, all the puppets turned into streaks of light and returned to their place in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Now, the space around them was empty save for the one puppet beside Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey touched the puppet beside him carefully. "Master Augustus, you say the puppet is more powerful than a mid-rank True God. Won't it defeat my father if I control the puppet?"</p>

  <p>"Defeat your father?" Augustus glanced at Zheng and smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>It was true that with this battle puppet, one could defeat an ordinary mid-rank True God. However, the previous fight between him and Zheng had already made Augustus realize that Zheng was by no means an ordinary mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>In Augustus' eyes, even a top-rank True God would be unable to defeat Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, however, didn't think too much about the answer. He liked the two gifts from Augustus and Hallet very much.</p>

  <p>Fulfilling his part of the agreement, Geoffrey took out his pen, unfolded a piece of soft white paper, and began to translate the six Golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, Augustus and Hallet kept suspecting Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>It was hard for them to believe that the little boy before them could decipher the group of Golden Sanskrit words that even their master couldn't crack. It also didn't help that what he deciphered was a mind method of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>But then again, seeing is believing.</p>

  <p>So when Geoffrey started writing the words one after the other, they recited them.</p>

  <p>In no more than twenty words, the two of them changed colors and felt a streak of the Truth of Godly Way slowly pressing down on their souls.</p>

  <p>This was how they felt when they cultivated the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos given by their master.</p>

  <p>However, in the opening chapter of the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, the Truth of Godly Way was not very strong, and it was far from being as powerful as that contained in the words written down by Geoffrey.</p>
