<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess also got caught in the open space of the Flaming Maple Forest, where Norris stood and looked at her with a frown.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, there were certain conditions to be met for him to capture the creatures from the chaos and drag them back to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't work if these creatures withdrew from the Other Shore more than three days ago. Because in that case, Norris couldn't see the shadow they left behind on the Other Shore. Besides, he could only randomly grab someone from those who left the Other Shore in groups.</p>

  <p>Now, he aimed to get Zheng, but he caught the wrong person twice.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>At that moment, a new arm began to grow from the wound on his left shoulder.</p>

  <p>The arm that broke before grew quite fast, but after he lost it twice in a row, the regeneration speed for the third arm became slower.</p>

  <p>But although Norris felt a little miserable, he wasn't anxious. Zheng was the last one, so he would catch him and take him back to the Other Shore next time. He still had enough time to complete the task.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Ear Mouse had gotten imprisoned. They exchanged worried looks while in silence.</p>

  <p>They survived the war against the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, only to get trapped in the Flaming Maple Forest!</p>

  <p>If Norris caught Zheng and took him to the Other Shore, he would be like a fish on the chopping block.</p>

  <p>Speaking of Zheng, he was now in the chaos with an unusually serious expression.</p>

  <p>"Master Zheng, what should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Were the Human Sovereign and the Snake Goddess really dragged back to the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I'm afraid you'll be the next one to be pulled to the Other Shore. You'd better find a way to escape as soon as possible. Squeak..."</p>

  <p>Dempsey and some Ear Mice, who were with him, couldn't help but feel anxious.</p>

  <p>Zheng just rolled his eyes and felt a little helpless. If only he could run, he would've run away.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what method the opponent had used to pull Fuxi and the Snake Goddess in, the enemy had probably taken advantage of the place where they withdrew from the Other Shore. After all, he couldn't change his position if he couldn't enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was most likely his turn to be dragged into the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>What to do now...</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was also silent, but he too tried to think of a way to break the situation. However, no matter how much he thought, it was useless since the theurgy wasn't allowed within the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>"If you can't use the theurgy, you can only fight with your physical body.</p>

  <p>Then, you need more strength and a stronger physical body..."</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>At that point, streams of blood gushed out from the Snake Goddess's back, and crimson words appeared from top to bottom on her snow-white skin.</p>

  <p>"You're lucky. You'll be the last one. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice and Zheng stared at the words sullenly. It was as if the words mocked them.</p>

  <p>"A stronger physical body and more strength..." Then, Zheng raised his hands and looked around.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline could change his physical form and also give him immensely strong power. However, it was very stingy. It would only strengthen his body when he was on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to persuade the ancestry-level bloodline, he suddenly felt his body become burning hot. The ancestry-level bloodline fluctuated, and then his body began to change drastically.</p>

  <p>Finally, his body instantly grew up to fifty feet high. The muscles on his chest became like small dragons, and his bones changed even more: each of his arms had one tibia before, but now six extra tibiae grew.</p>

  <p>The extra tibiae formed a more complex but very solid bone system.</p>

  <p>As his physical body changed, his aura also changed a lot. Several Holy Soul Realm Ear Mice, including Dempsey, all looked at him in fear.</p>

  <p>Even though they knew it was Zheng, and he could change, they still couldn't help but feel afraid.</p>

  <p>Of course, his excessive strength and powerful physical body also changed his state of mind.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he felt a strong urge to fight!</p>

  <p>His panic was gone without a trace, replaced with a sense of expectation.</p>

  <p>He even waited eagerly for the opponent to pull him to the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, multiple nonhuman creatures waited in the open space of the forest.</p>

  <p>Norris' left arm was still growing slowly. As the new and tender flesh slowly emerged, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan became increasingly desperate.</p>

  <p>Not long after, his left arm had fully grown. Then, he created another bloodstain on his left arm and removed it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Light glowed on the palm of the broken arm and he stretched it towards the void.</p>

  <p>The moment the broken arm touched the void, it caught something.</p>

  <p>"I have caught him!"</p>

  <p>The corners of his mouth curled up into a smirk. This time, he wouldn't make a mistake again.</p>

  <p>With a fierce tug, he dragged Zheng to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the members of the Misty River race who were watching on the side, all expected that an ordinary Eternal Realm human warrior would come out from the other side.</p>

  <p>However, what appeared was not a human, but a massive creature that was fifty feet tall!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the creature, Fuxi instinctively thought that Zheng had activated the Wild God Body, but the Flaming Maple Forest attacked anyone who used the Wild God Power and made any move related to energy.</p>

  <p>Yet, he saw that Zheng had changed his appearance entirely. He realized that Zheng's bloodline must've worked!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' and King Ieuan's eyes both lit up with hope. They knew how powerful the bloodline in Zheng's body was.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that you waited for me, right?" Zheng said as he looked down at Norris in front of him. "You are..."</p>

  <p>At first, Norris was complacent and believed that he would surely catch Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>But now, his voice became slightly shaky as he faced the immensely tall Zheng.</p>

  <p>The nonhuman creatures behind him looked even more terrified. One of them, who held a basin of Soul Interdicting Water, dare not pour it on Zheng!</p>

  <p>Even Larkin of the Misty River race stared at Zheng in trepidation, his bronze-colored face wrinkling by his frown.</p>

  <p>After the Element Spirit Civilization had paid a heavy price, the members of the Misty River race allowed them to act rashly in this place.</p>

  <p>However, this "human being" Norris had pulled into the Other Shore secretly threatened Larkin.</p>

  <p>He had not felt like that in a long time, so he was extremely upset about it.</p>

  <p>"I am Zheng," Zheng replied. "How did you... become like this?" Norris asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"You just need to know the consequence of provoking me," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What consequence?"</p>

  <p>"Crack…"</p>

  <p>Before he could say anything else, Zheng grabbed his shoulder with one hand and gripped his face with the other.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's strong legs suddenly kicked on the ground and dug two big holes.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>At the next moment, everyone saw that he had pushed Norris against the biggest Flaming Maple Tree. His force also hit the tree, which caused many leaves to fall. However, the maple leaves didn't shine or explode.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Next, they all saw that Zheng's hands had turned into countless fist shadows.</p>

  <p>Clouds of blood mist burst out as each fist shadow exploded upon Norris' body.</p>

  <p>About thirty seconds later, Norris' powerful body had turned into thin shreds that clung onto the Flaming Maple Tree. None of his body parts were still intact.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around and said, "The consequence is death."</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't say those words to Norris, who was already dead.</p>
