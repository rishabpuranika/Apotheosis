<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The strong azure flames burned brightly as they gave off a striking aura.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng had already expected such a thing when he had attacked the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were about to spit flames, he immediately shouted, "Everyone, get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Then, he quickly rushed to the far right side of the position.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Basil was also quick to react. As soon as Zheng finished speaking, he sped up and moved to the right as well.</p>

  <p>The other Oneness Generals also followed suit and dodged to the side in pairs.</p>

  <p>However, two Oneness Generals in a position behind Sinclair panicked and dashed towards the opposite directions.</p>

  <p>As a result, their position didn't move with either of them.</p>

  <p>When one of them realized what happened, he ran to the other side and three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows spat out fire in return.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, three blue flames with mysterious sparks were shot forward and swallowed the position in an instant.</p>

  <p>The two Oneness Generals stood in the position and as they looked at the blue flames that were heading towards them, they thought of leaving things to chance.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the blue flames from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were not that powerful.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they would soon realize that they were very wrong.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>At that moment, the array of the Mountain Sea Pass, the positions that protected Zheng, Sinclair, and the others, and the transparent long swords they had formed all shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that the people who guarded the main array had no time to stabilize it with more divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the two Oneness Generals who faced the blue flames were burnt to ashes and vanished without a trace when their position was broken.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the blue flames continued to fly forward, but they did not hit the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>That was because the Sky Net had appeared and blocked the flames when they were about to approach the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Although the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were powerful, they couldn't tear the Sky Net apart with only a few flames from their mouths.</p>

  <p>"Sisters, I'll leave the rest to you. I'll deal with that guy!" Queenie said as a coquettish red light flashed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had almost killed her just now, she naturally wanted to take revenge and kill him herself.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The second she finished speaking, the Invisibility Curtain in her hand spread in the air, and then she and a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Mountain Sea Pass was damaged, and the shattered array couldn't protect Sinclair and the other Oneness Generals anymore.</p>

  <p>Now, they had no room to retreat.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Oneness Guards and the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Mountain Sea Pass ran outside the Sky Net and fought against the enemy.</p>

  <p>Since they were Oneness Generals, they also couldn't retreat to the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Sky Net was not omnipotent. Once it collapsed, they would still have to face the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng saw that Queenie and the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow disappeared, he became more vigilant. He began to fly backward, a long sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>In turn, streaks of sword light swiftly formed a net and advanced forward.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's defense power was quite strong, so he didn't expect the golden light to injure it.</p>

  <p>In the next second, the net-shaped sword light cut across the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's body with a muffled sound. Just like he had guessed, Queenie had driven the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow to try to attack him.</p>

  <p>Even though the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was gone, the sword net still drew its shape.</p>

  <p>"Kill him," Queenie, who stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, ordered in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Despite Zheng having injured her, she still didn't think that he was a powerful being.</p>

  <p>Instead, she believed that he defeated her with the array of the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A strong gust of wind blew as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow circled in the air, its wide wings like thick blades that slashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>In return, he relied on the continuous sword radiance as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow continued to assault him.</p>

  <p>He took a slight step back and suddenly jumped backward, and successfully avoided the wings' attack.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Just as he had dodged, several deep and wide cuts appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked to see those cuts the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow had made, but he didn't show it.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow seemed to have no intelligence, so it couldn't possibly cultivate— let alone enter the Other Shore. Therefore, how did it release so many divine megatons of force?</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Just as he thought about it, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow launched a series of attacks once again, so he quickly dodged and slashed with the sword radiance in response.</p>

  <p>After he had blocked about six strikes in a row, Queenie's beautiful eyes narrowed into slits, and then she flapped her wings and left the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. It wasn't long before she had quietly passed through the net of sword radiance and was now near Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>When she finally landed, she stretched out her hands and quickly patted Zheng on the shoulder two times.</p>

  <p>The seemingly gentle pat left two lock-shaped marks on Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Right after the lock-shaped marks appeared, he felt his arms and legs become incomparably heavy. It turned out that his limbs were fixed in place and he couldn't move at all!</p>

  <p>"You are dead..." Queenie whispered with a smile.</p>

  <p>Then, she turned around and did not look back.</p>

  <p>Not far away was the hidden Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, which finally showed up.</p>

  <p>Its mouth spurted out blue flames as it passed by Queenie and headed straight towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Alas, Zheng failed to dodge. The blue flames had hit him and devoured his entire body.</p>

  <p>Queenie's wings flapped as she looked down from the air, her eyes filled with pride.</p>

  <p>The blue flames that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow spat out was also a kind of divine flame of the Sun Crow race. The Sun Crow race classified their flames, and one of the deadliest flames among them was the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's, which was only inferior to Emperor Charm's.</p>

  <p>As an Oneness General, Zheng was quick to react, but he would die as the flames had hit him.</p>

  <p>The whole battlefield was in chaos, but the light of the blue flames still attracted some people's attention.</p>

  <p>Even Sinclair, who was busy killing the Sun Crows, froze when he saw the scene. He sighed a little and looked away.</p>

  <p>Of course, he thought that Zheng was an outstanding young man. After all, Zheng had just left the Land of Sword Grief, yet he had displayed such strength. It was rare to see a talent like him, so it was a pity that he died like that.</p>

  <p>Basil, Guzman, and the others were also shocked, but they couldn't think too much as they were in the middle of a fight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The blue flames continued to burn Zheng's body for over thirty seconds, but he simply stood still. After a while, golden spirals materialized on his body and absorbed the flames.</p>

  <p>The situation wasn't new to him as he intentionally or even unintentionally let various kinds of flames burn him all the time. Most of the time, however, those flames did not have much effect on him.</p>

  <p>He had taken the test of the God of Fire, known as Zhurong, back in the Creation Myth Temple, but sadly that was only an illusion the Primeval Lord of Heaven had made. Thus, it didn't benefit his physical body at all.</p>
