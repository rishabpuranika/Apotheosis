<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4306 The Attacking Method </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head to scan the downgrader from head to toe. His posture remained unchanged since he appeared, and there was no hint of fear or caution.</p>

  <p>It was as though he was a lifeless statue. There was no movement or momentum, which was peculiar for someone that had infinite energy.</p>

  <p>It was unnecessary for the downgrader to initiate the confrontation using his bare fists. Of course, doing that was just out of habit.</p>

  <p>"Mastema, can you stop?" Luo Zheng asked as he directly addressed the downgrader.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that someone had referred to the downgrader by his name.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng speak it so casually infuriated the downgrader. The six pairs of compound eyes lit up simultaneously and shot out a sharp crimson light. The light was restrained to a certain degree, and it was as thin as a thread. It extended towards the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace and caused faint water ripples upon contact with its surface.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had no intention to attack Luo Zheng with this move, but his reaction was forced out of him through anger.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! You're just a lowly human being. What gives you the right to tell me what to do! Let Clarence come out. Let him talk to me!" the downgrader shouted, his tone reflecting unparalleled rage.</p>

  <p>The people in the fairy palace were all taken aback by the downgrader's extreme reaction.</p>

  <p>Why was the downgrader so triggered by Luo Zheng calling him 'Mastema'?</p>

  <p>"Clarence has grown tired of everything. He has entrusted his entire strength to me," Luo Zheng said as he returned the downgrader's stern look.</p>

  <p>"You can't be serious. Why would Clarence give all his strength to a lowly human like you? This is outrageous!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words seemed to have fueled the rage lingering within the downgrader that he was trying hard to suppress.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a crack extended across his head, forming a large mouth intertwined with sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>He flapped the wings on his back to flaunt his dominance over Luo Zheng. The wings were abnormally huge with scales etched all over them. His appearance was nothing short of a demon who arrived straight from the depths of hell to unleash divine punishment upon them.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he advanced with untraceable speed and crashed into the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier once hailed to be invincible was forcefully twisted out of shape by the downgrader. Although it didn't shatter completely after the first blow, some parts of it took reasonable damage and were weakened.</p>

  <p>The downgrader didn't top there, he continued to press on the enchanted barrier to test the limits of its resistance. He was only about a foot away from reaching Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why? Just why was all of the strength passed down to such a lowly creature who doesn't deserve it?" the downgrader roared out of frustration at Luo Zheng. His voice was even more piercing than before.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's demeanor remained steady and calm as he returned the downgrader's gaze.</p>

  <p>He had seen faint hints of the Evil God's special characteristics from the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The downgrader portrayed all elements of the Evil God's personality; strong, cunning, neurotic, and hysterical.</p>

  <p>The downgrader continued to roar on top of his lungs as he appealed, "I'm this close to fulfilling your most cherished desire. I'm this close in making it happen. I'll be the one who will craft the most beautiful world you've ever seen with my own two hands. I implore you to take back your strength from this lowly creature!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Clarence could see and hear the downgrader. However, he chose to remain silent as he stared blankly at him.</p>

  <p>Why did Mastema suddenly get so worked up about Clarence passing his strength down to Luo Zheng temporarily?</p>

  <p>The downgrader continued his rant for a long time before he went silent.</p>

  <p>His body was ultimately pushed into the air by the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave out an exasperated sigh and shook his head before his body slowly ascended in the air. He made his way out of the enchanted barrier and moved in front of the downgrader to look him dead in the eye. "I'm in charge of the force of Clarence. Your biggest enemy right now is me."</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve to wield it!"</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Countless downgraders overlapped with each other as they launched an individual palm strike aimed at Luo Zheng. It was as though Luo Zheng was being rained with an infinite amount of fists one after another.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>When the first strike struck Luo Zheng, a palm print was imprinted on his chest, and then it was later overlapped with another palm print. Then a third one, and a fourth, and a fifth...</p>

  <p>Within the short span of three seconds, Luo Zheng's chest was covered in tens of billions of palm strikes. His body almost became unrecognizable, now cloaked with countless palm imprints etched all over it.</p>

  <p>After being struck with those attacks, Luo Zheng's features and limbs were bent out of shape to the point that they were severely disfigured. His bones and flesh had been integrated into a single organism, and his appearance was reduced to that of a ball of meat that had been continuously kneaded for tens of billions of times.</p>

  <p>Purr...</p>

  <p>But after a short while, the ball of meat started to tremble voluntarily.</p>

  <p>Luscious thick black hair, a pair of eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrows began to reappear from it. When the mold completely unwrapped itself, Luo Zheng regained his usual self seemingly unscathed.</p>

  <p>The onlookers from the fairy palace remained rooted to their spots as they watched the scene unravel before their eyes with their mouths agape.</p>

  <p>Their eyes couldn't keep up with the rapid palm strikes the downgrader unleashed on Luo Zheng, but they did witness Luo Zheng's body shaped up into a mold due to the pressure. To them, it was like watching Luo Zheng continuously being pinched by an invisible hand, and the mass of his flesh and blood was like rolling water.</p>

  <p>"Were you able to make out what just happened to Luo Zheng? How did he suddenly become that thing? I can't tell what has happened, as it all happened so fast..." Even the Snake Goddess, who was the smartest being present in that crowd, was rendered speechless at this sight.</p>

  <p>"He must have been continuously attacked by the downgrader without pause," Hilario said as he stared up at Luo Zheng's floating figure. He was making this assumption because Luo Zheng had previously mentioned the attacking method of the Probability Extreme Form in front of him before.</p>

  <p>His explanation already sounded too exaggerated. But what Hilario was unaware of was the fact that Luo Zheng was confronted with tens of billions of blows one after another, and if the downgrader wished, he could tamper with the frequency and increase the rate even further.</p>

  <p>"You barely managed to tickle me. Was that the best you could do? It's my turn now," Luo Zheng said as he gave his knuckles a light crack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now the bearer of infinite energy that knew no bounds. He was able to release any amount of energy as he saw fit, and the reserves of it were absolutely limitless.</p>

  <p>"Mirror!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exclaimed on top of his lungs. In response to his call, a circular silver mirror made of light stationed itself above his head.</p>

  <p>"Ten billion." Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes as he glared at the downgrader staring back at him.</p>

  <p>Just as those words left his mouth, Luo Zheng felt the enormous reserves of ancestry-level bloodline gush out from him uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>If the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline was equivalent to that of a flowing river before, it had now upgraded itself and became as endless as seawater overflowing from every fiber of his being.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Soon, the sky was dominated by the presence of ten billion silver light mirrors.</p>

  <p>The silver light mirrors distributed across the space soon became so overwhelming that it was hard to escape the sight of them. They lit up the entire sky in a flash.</p>

  <p>The Troubled Creatures that were still engulfed in their battle were forced to delay it as they raised their heads to make sense of the situation.</p>

  <p>Their vision was filled with many stars flickering and twinkling in the sky.</p>

  <p>The formation of the silver light mirrors seemed unorganized, but in fact, each of their positions was preplanned according to a certain rule.</p>

  <p>"Uniting!" Luo Zheng yelled out another command.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>At his words, each of the silver light mirrors began to emit streams of energy. These streaks of energy collided with each other and constantly bounced off each other until all of them gathered together to form an ingenious structure.</p>

  <p>"Annihilating!" A murderous look appeared in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The silver energy flow collected itself at one point before unleashing itself wholly at the downgrader.</p>

  <p>This killing move was something Luo Zheng extracted from one of Clarence's memories. The technique did not have a unique name to itself. It only consisted of three steps; 'Mirror', 'Uniting', and 'Annihilating'. It was a carefully constructed attacking method that was created using three distinct Extreme Form energies.</p>

  <p>The turbulent energy flow flew across the air and pierced its way through the Burial Land from the center. In a short span of thirty seconds, the energy flow had traveled across the chaos and reached the edge.</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>The energy flow contained an ominous aura and forcefully opened a big hole in the chaos leading to the Abstruse Energy World!</p>

  <p>At this time, the Evil God's avatar was carrying the triangular rock to complete the enclosure. When his gaze fell on the stream of energy sweeping across the sky at an incredible speed, he couldn't help but feel startled at the overwhelming sight. His eyes slowly widened in surprise as he felt a deep fear sprout from within his heart.</p>

  <p>"Where did that attack come from?"</p>

  <p>Before he could speak more to voice his growing concerns, he felt a wave coming from behind him. As he turned around to know the source, his eyes met those of the real Evil God.</p>

  <p>Wherever the avatar carried the triangular rock, the territory it covered was instantly marked as a part of the Source World. The real Evil God could then appear and disappear at will within the range.</p>

  <p>The real Evil God also sensed an astounding amount of energy flow surging from the boundaries of the Burial Land. He moved out to check it out for himself.</p>

  <p>When he witnessed the large hole in the chaos, his expression darkened as a shadow hovered over his eyes.</p>

  <p>The strength of this energy flow was far beyond the conjecture of the real Evil God.</p>
