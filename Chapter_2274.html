  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harold pondered for a moment and then said, "After this re-ranking of the Floating Islands, the members of the Zhao Clan, the Liu Clan, the Qin Clan, the Mu Clan, the Tang Clan, the Leng Clan and the Dongfang Clan are strictly not allowed to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain."</p>

  <p>His voice sounded very calm.</p>

  <p>However, this caused a stir among the True Gods present there.</p>

  <p>"What are you saying? That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Why can't we enter the Everest Spirit Mountain?"</p>

  <p>"Harold, are you out of your mind? Your mere words can't stop us from entering the mountain. What a joke!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods of all the ranks were visibly upset with Harold's decision.</p>

  <p>They were not convinced at all and believed that they had every right to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, members of other clans, such as the Han Clan and the Zhou Clan were undeterred by this decision. They were secretly pleased instead.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands meant a great deal to the powerful clans on the Floating Islands as they provided them with a foundation to gain a foothold.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands consisted of the massive divine might coins and rare mineral resources. Over the years, the powerful clans had explored thoroughly the forbidden lands, and the competition was fierce among them. Their disciples would fight with each other every time the forbidden lands were opened. Although the safety of anyone who went there wasn't guaranteed, all the clans and the True Gods went there without much hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Everest Spirit Mountain was one of the four great forbidden lands, and it wasn't as dangerous as the rest of the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>The Soul Wilderness was quite mysterious and changeable as far as the four forbidden lands were concerned, and the Swirl Forest was full of fierce animals. The Abyss Demon Region was the most dangerous one.</p>

  <p>There was a slim chance of survival even for the top-rank True Gods who went there. It was quite common for the consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings to die there.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Everest Spirit Mountain was of great value and importance to all the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"The Zhao Clan, the Liu Clan, the Qin Clan, the Mu Clan..." Luo Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He took a mental note of all the powerful clans Harold had mentioned earlier.</p>

  <p>Murphy wasn't able to destroy the Luo Clan alone. His clan was way too weak to compete with Luo Zheng's clan, so the above-mentioned clans must have worked together with Murphy in order to wipe out the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>"If the members of the Han Clan, the Moon Clan, the Sword Clan and the Gu Clan wish to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain, I will take it upon myself to open the Cloud Dragon Ravine for you because..." Harold said in a calm voice, as he made a strange gesture.</p>

  <p>This confused various people present there.</p>

  <p>It was no secret that Harold had a liking towards the members of the Gu Clan. Mike and Bromley enjoyed a friendly relationship, so did their clans. But Harold's goodwill towards the Han Clan, the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan was quite baffling to many.</p>

  <p>When the Luo Clan was going through some difficult times, these three clans were privy to their situation. They neither offered them any help, nor did they create any more troubles for them to deal with.</p>

  <p>"What does that gesture mean?"</p>

  <p>"It looks as if he is giving a signal; what is he suggesting?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. But I knew he would create inconvenience for us if he took full control of the Everest Spirit Mountain. Since we can't go to the Everest Spirit Mountain, do we have to go to the Swirl Forest instead?" someone muttered.</p>

  <p>There were some other existences in this fictional world that no one else detected.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, some Holy Beings from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had their eyes fixed upon Harold.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being of the Tang Clan had had enough. He finally stood up and said, "The Everest Spirit Mountain doesn't belong to you, Harold.</p>

  <p>Therefore, you have no right to prevent us from entering it."</p>

  <p>This Holy Being was quite ill-tempered. His booming echoed in everyone's ears. His voice was enough to wake the dead.</p>

  <p>Harold directly looked at him and said, "From the moment I took control of the Everest Spirit Mountain, it belongs to me. Do you have any further questions?"</p>

  <p>"Harold!" The Holy Being of the Tang Clan lost all of his cool and said,</p>

  <p>"Even Estelle isn't as overbearing as you are."</p>

  <p>There had been two rulers of the four forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>The first one was Estelle, who had control over the Soul Wilderness. But she had disappeared for a few years before reappearing in the Evolutionary Universe recently.</p>

  <p>During her dominion over the Soul Wilderness, she did not set any particular rules and allowed the disciples of various powerful clans on the Floating Islands to come in and out freely.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the Soul Wilderness was at her disposal, so she could stop anyone from going in if she wanted. That was why she enjoyed a higher status in the eyes of the Holy Beings. If someone won her over, they would be able to control the Soul Wilderness. Moreover, she had the treasure scepter. The Holy Beings were quite wary of it.</p>

  <p>The second ruler was Harold. As soon as he took control of the Everest Spirit Mountain, he announced that he would not allow the clans that had once suppressed the Luo Clan to enter. The Holy Beings still didn't know what kind of ability the Everest Spirit Mountain had. Thus, they were afraid that Harold might become more powerful by taking in whatever the Everest Spirit Mountain had to give.</p>

  <p>"As you can see, I'm different from Estelle. You should have seen it coming a long time ago. You should have figured this out when you were bullying the Luo Clan. And I have just started with my plot." Harold gave a cold smile. "By the way, let this be a message to the Jiang Clan to not chase me anymore. I won't be so forgiving the next time." he added.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was done speaking, he left. The blood red Arena of Legends left as well and darkness engulfed the surroundings.</p>

  <p>The True Gods left one by one and soon Luo Luo Zheng was left all alone.</p>

  <p>'That gesture was from Yan, ' he thought. Luo Zheng's heart was pounding out of his chest.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had protected his sister ever since their childhood. As he saw Harold make the gesture, he realized that it was from Yan as if she was the one protecting him.</p>

  <p>Since Wynn helped Luo Luo Zheng sneak into the ancestral land of the Han Clan, Harold must have guessed that Luo Luo Zheng had joined the Han Clan. Therefore, he grabbed this opportunity to give Luo Luo Zheng a signal.</p>

  <p>Harold had mentioned the Gu Clan, the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan to distract people from the fact that he really wished to target the Han Clan. Even though the Holy Beings had doubts about it, it was almost impossible for them to find Luo Luo Zheng from these four powerful clans.</p>

  <p>'The Everest Spirit Mountain and the Cloud Dragon Ravine, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, and he also disappeared.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Time Sea stood the Hall of Holy Beings in the clouds.</p>

  <p>An old man with a ruddy face stood in front of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>His eyes were filled with anger. He was the Holy Being of the Tang Clan, Clark Tang.</p>

  <p>Clark Tang appeared quite furious and enraged.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do about Harold?" Clark roared.</p>

  <p>The Tang Clan developed quite swiftly over the divine eras. Their rank increased from twenty-sixth to ninth. This was due to the Everest Spirit Mountain. Among the powerful clans, they knew the mountain quite well and had gathered a great deal of information about the mountain.</p>

  <p>Whenever the Everest Spirit Mountain was opened, their disciples always reaped the most.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Clark was the first Holy Being to lose his temper in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>"You didn't kill Harold when you had the chance. Now he has gained control over the Everest Spirit Mountain. Do you regret it now?" A calm voice came.</p>

  <p>"We won't compromise with Harold. Didn't you see him make that gesture? He has been saving his strength for a while now. Now he is about to make some big moves."</p>

  <p>"He is also good at making plans just like Mike. He must have been fully prepared by now."</p>

  <p>"I wonder which clan and person he targets." The Holy Beings had no clue as to what the future held.</p>

  <p>"No matter what kind of trap he sets, can he really flatten the Floating Islands? He's just bragging and showing off his position. It isn't necessarily our loss if we give up a forbidden land. If we join hands to develop the Swirl Forest and the Abyss Demon Region, there may be some unexpected surprises."</p>

  <p>"Well, we can ask Dongfang about it, when he finishes his practice."</p>

  <p>There was a vast majority of unexplored forbidden lands in the divine land, and no one knew what was in them.</p>

  <p>Although the Holy Beings believed that these uncharted territories would help them, they were still quite upset over the loss of the Everest Spirit Mountain and they knew that it was irreplaceable. That was the reason why Clark was so angry.</p>
