  <p>
</p>

  <p>Currently, the Source World attracted a large number of vicious heads because of its huge structure.</p>

  <p>When the heads first appeared in the Source World, the Evil God instantly realized that something wrong was going on. With this, he immediately summoned numerous avatars of himself and mobilized all the forces.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Bloom Divine Province, the place had been plagued by earthquakes for almost a month now.</p>

  <p>Along with this, a terrible rumor had been spreading among the citizens.</p>

  <p>"Did you know? There are countless humongous and horrifying heads underground. These are what caused these earthquakes!"</p>

  <p>"They said these heads are hundreds of millions of feet in height. They can devour anything, living or inanimate!"</p>

  <p>"We're no longer safe here. We have to run away from this place!"</p>

  <p>But with all these, others just laughed at the nasty rumors and didn't pay much attention to it. After all, a large number of powerful warriors were gathered in the Source World. Even if the rumors were true and the monstrous heads surfaced from the ground, they believed that the warriors of the Source World would save the day.</p>

  <p>However, the Taiyi Heaven Palace no longer existed. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were also destroyed. Right now, no other forces had assumed control over the Bloom Divine Province. Thus, it was currently a land without a ruler.</p>

  <p>With this, some of the big clans around the Clear Lake were preparing to grab the supremacy in the region.</p>

  <p>The Bloom Divine Province had always been a birthplace of great talents, and it had the reputation of nurturing a potential super force. Thus, it should only be a matter of time when one of these large clans rose and replaced the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>In recent days, in order to compete for the power and profit, the big clans around the Clear Lake had been holding continuous competitions.</p>

  <p>The geniuses at the Other Shore Realm from various clans participated and gave their all to battle it out in the ring.</p>

  <p>This day, tens of thousands of people gathered by the Clear Lake to watch another set of breathtaking matches. On the surface of the lake, two young elites were competing like two atrocious waterfowls.</p>

  <p>Every time they would exchange a blow, a deafening sound would reverberate, creating ripples and shaking even the depths of the lake.</p>

  <p>The fierce showdown between the two young elites had lasted for about five minutes. One of them, who was in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm, obviously had a greater edge. Under his constant attacks, his opponent's strength gradually weakened.</p>

  <p>"Take this! Shining Dragon Sword Skill!" the elite on the third stage of the Other Shore Realm roared mightily, ready to finish his opponent with this strike.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a violent earthquake occurred again.</p>

  <p>This time, the tremor they felt was much stronger than the previous ones.</p>

  <p>Fissures appeared on the ground and some houses even started to collapse.</p>

  <p>However, because of the frequent waves of earthquakes recently, nobody was alarmed anymore. They weren't fazed and still focused their attention on the on-going battle.</p>

  <p>As soon as the third-stage Other Shore Realm warrior employed his sword skill, the water in the Clear Lake started to decline sharply. In just a few seconds, the entire lake dried up, exposing the massive lakebed.</p>

  <p>"Wait. Was this caused by the sword skill of that young man from the Su Clan?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Even if he's a promising warrior, he's still currently in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm. He can't be the one who did this."</p>

  <p>"If that's true, then what happened to the Clear Lake?"</p>

  <p>The onlookers chatted with each other, figuring out what had happened to the water in the lake.</p>

  <p>Even the two competitors above the lake were taken aback. They immediately stopped their battle, startled with the strange phenomenon.</p>

  <p>As the water in the lake completely disappeared, everyone soon saw a huge sculpture of a face on the lakebed. It had vivid eyes, mouth, and nose.</p>

  <p>Some people thought that this sculpture was just probably hidden at the bottom of the lake all this time.</p>

  <p>However, as some stared intently at it, they were instantly reminded of that circulating ominous rumor.</p>

  <p>The Source World had already been invaded by tens of millions of these ferocious heads. Sooner or later, this world would be completely devoured by them if nothing was done.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>What they saw was a head five hundred times its original size.</p>

  <p>It had been biting and drilling in a specific direction all this time. It was like a worm that pervaded a fruit. A very long and thin cave was created under the Source World, and now, this head finally emerged above the surface of the Source World through the earth of the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>It meant that the recent earthquakes in the Bloom Divine Province were all caused by this single giant head.</p>

  <p>For these heads, living creatures were actually better prey than any other substances.</p>

  <p>Thus, as it emerged from the bottom of the Clear Lake, it immediately opened its huge mouth and bit towards the edge of the lakeshore and attacked the people there.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Crack!</p>

  <p>A huge tooth mark appeared on the edge of the lakeshore. Both the young elites and tens of thousands of the onlookers were instantly swallowed into the head's mouth. They didn't even have the time to react and escape with the frightening speed of the huge head.</p>

  <p>Similar to the scene that just happened by the Clear Lake, this same disaster was simultaneously happening throughout the Source World.</p>

  <p>The head that appeared in the Clear Lake wasn't even the worst. Some heads were about tens of thousands of times their original size, appearing in various large provinces.</p>

  <p>These colossal heads were by no means something that ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm could handle. At best, they might be able to resist the heads that were about a thousand times their original size.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Clear Lake's bank, some lucky survivors started running like crazy, trying to escape from the huge head that had already killed thousands of people in just a blink of the eye.</p>

  <p>One of them suddenly stopped in his tracks as his body twitched. His face became blurry and gradually turned into that of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Six Truths Explosion!"</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation, this replica of the Evil God summoned six energy balls of different colors from his head, hands, feet, and abdomen.</p>

  <p>Right after he gathered them, he teleported into the mouth of the huge head and rammed these energy balls into it.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>A devastating pillar of light penetrated the head. It left a huge hole in it, where the light surged into the sky. Everyone in the Bloom Divine Province could clearly see this dazzling pillar of light.</p>

  <p>The blinding light continued to disintegrate the head until it turned to dust.</p>

  <p>At the same time, about hundreds of provinces away from the Clear Lake, a large bed lay at the center of a broad, black hall.</p>

  <p>On this very bed, Edna was resting in the arms of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Recently, the Evil God had been bad-tempered and irritable.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Edna would even doubt if this man was the real Evil God.</p>

  <p>Behind the hall where they were was a huge square. Here, over ten thousand people were sitting with their legs crossed as if in meditation.</p>

  <p>These were all replicas of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Although they were just replicas, they were no different from the real Evil God. They shared the same strength, aura, and even thoughts.</p>

  <p>As the current ruler of the Source World, the Evil God discerned that the invasion of the menacing heads would bring huge troubles.</p>

  <p>If he failed to eliminate all these abominable heads, the Source World would be devoured and destroyed in a short time.</p>

  <p>However, though he had already mobilized all his forces throughout the Source World, and even asked the help of the Nihility race through the Black Ship, he still couldn't find an effective way to deal with the heads.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, the Black Ship had already contacted the Nihility race, and the Grandmaster of Heaven himself descended to the Source World to check on the situation. However, he only told the Evil God that he would try to think of a solution and quickly returned to the Other Shore afterward.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment, he could only rely on himself to solve this crisis.</p>

  <p>It might be too late for the Source World if he kept on waiting for the help of others.</p>

  <p>On a whim, he gathered over ten thousand of his replicas in an attempt to think of a viable solution to their dilemma. This was the reason why these replicas were all currently at the square.</p>

  <p>Some of them were thinking by themselves, while others were discussing in groups.</p>

  <p>Even the Six Truths Explosion, which was the powerful skill that his replica had performed to vanquish the huge head by the Clear Lake, was a result of this kind of brainstorming.</p>

  <p>He believed that little by little, they were making progress in destroying their opponents. However, because of the overwhelming number of the heads, the current methods that they formulated were still far from enough to annihilate them all.</p>

  <p>That was why they couldn't afford to stop thinking of a better way.</p>

  <p>Lying on the comfortable bed, the Evil God slowly let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Edna tied up her silky black hair, gazed at the Evil God, and said, "With so many avatars helping you to find a solution, why do you have to bother yourself about it?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God was getting too absorbed with it that his temperament had changed drastically.</p>

  <p>In the past, all he needed to do was destroy everything as he pleased. He was just a reckless and happy-go-lucky guy that did whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>But since he assumed control of the Source World, he now had the responsibility to protect the land and the people.</p>

  <p>And this was something that he was not good at.</p>

  <p>"If all the heads came from a single direction, I wouldn't need to worry this much. But they're everywhere! They're scattered in the entire chaos, and they come from all directions. It's just impossible to guard against them. I don't think there is a perfect solution to deal with them," the Evil God complained in an annoyed tone.</p>

  <p>With her hand covering her bare shoulder, Edna buried her head in thought for a while. Then, out of nowhere, she just blurted out, "Is there anything that would repel the heads?"</p>

  <p>"Repel the heads?" The Evil God furrowed his brows as he entertained this thought. After a few moments, his eyes suddenly lit up, and there was a faint grin on his face. "Edna, what do you think would they hate the most?"</p>
