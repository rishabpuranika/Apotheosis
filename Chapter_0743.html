<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 743 Marilyn Challenged Luo Zheng (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The sixth-grade pill Luo Zheng offered slowly but surely began its task of relieving the pain the man was going through. Since he was not dead, there was a high chance that he could get significantly better after consuming the elixir.</p>

  <p>The pill started to mend his vessels and heal from the inside.</p>

  <p>However, it was concerning that the meridians in Owen's body were almost completely damaged. Even if he was capable of a full recovery from his major injuries, it would be difficult for him to regain his former strength and prowess quickly. He was looking at maybe several years down the road before coming back to his strongest form. If worse came to worst, he might never be able to reach his former level for the rest of his existence.</p>

  <p>With the elixir numbing his pain, his excited smile seemed more like a grimace when he tried to lift his head to look at Luo Zheng. As he paid no attention to the current condition of his body, the fire of hope in his heart that had been extinguished upon being thoroughly beaten had ignited once again.</p>

  <p>Anyone who were in his shoes would have been thrilled despite everything.</p>

  <p>His plan to take down Marilyn failed miserably, which meant that he would never get his girlfriend back unless Eddie released her. However, it was impossible for Eddie to let his beloved go.</p>

  <p>Discovering that someone else had also planned to destroy Marilyn lightened his mood. Although he had still felt hopeless and despair, a beacon of light shone through in the form of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng leaned over him and quietly inspected his weary state, he met the eyes of Owen and tried his best to give him a reassuring nod. "You should take your time and rest," the man stated before walking back to the platform. He quietly muttered, "Leave it to me."</p>

  <p>When Marilyn saw the exchange, a faint sneer graced her features. The woman scoffed under her breath and then turned away, fixing her gaze on the ongoing battle.</p>

  <p>Right in the center of the battle ring stood two men engaged in an intense fight. One of the fighters was Brent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect and his opponent was Joel who hailed from the Mysterious Luna Hall.</p>

  <p>Comparing the rank of both men, Joel appeared to be marginally stronger, as he had reached the medium level of the Internal Elixir Realm while Brent was only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Astonishingly, the latter had the upper hand ever since the fight started despite the difference in rank. Cultivation levels almost always determined the outcome of a match but it seemed that this particular fight was an exception to the norm.</p>

  <p>At a young age, the fifteen-year-old genius surprisingly held his position well against his opponent as he fully displayed his immense strength and ingenious strategies in combat.</p>

  <p>Even though Joel of the Mysterious Luna Hall had showcased his best secret skills, the younger man was unfazed by the attacks and easily countered them. Grunting, Joel was left desperate of any special secret moves that could overpower the other. It seemed as if all his offensive attacks were not effective against him as he fended them off quite easily.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Brent did not feel the need to use his Space Law which he specialized in, due to the fact that his opponent was too weak.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the spectators, it was without a doubt that Brent won the fight. Fortunately for him, it appeared as though luck was on his side when he had gotten a challenge card after.</p>

  <p>Grinning victoriously, he examined the piece of board on his hand.</p>

  <p>"Challenge card, huh.." the boy murmured, turning over the object on his palm and tracing the roughness of its engravings. As Brent stared at the board in his hands, he noticed the anticipation of the people around him and his gaze fell on the platform. With a resolute mind, he nodded to himself as he intended to use the challenge token right away.</p>

  <p>Murmurs such as "Who does he want to challenge now?" rose from the crowd as they wondered who he would choose to face off next in the battle ring.</p>

  <p>"The nerve of this boy, just getting a challenge card and immediately using it. How cocky.."</p>

  <p>"He's got some spirit! As expected, the genius of the Ethereal Spirit Sect is amazing!" Despite the unconvinced voices from the antagonistic folks, there were some who showed intrigue and support at the rising power of the cultivator.</p>

  <p>Scanning his eyes through the cultivators on the opposite side from where he stood, he picked up on the aloofness of a man who seemed strong yet indifferent to the budding atmosphere that surrounded the grounds.</p>

  <p>Smirking at his decision and thus pointing at his next conquest, Brent confidently declared, "For the next match, I want to challenge you, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Slightly surprised, Luo Zheng furrowed his eyebrows as he heard his name being called. Numerous heads turned towards his direction, as they were expectant of his answer.</p>

  <p>From the speculations made a while back, Brent was also a divine-level talent just like Eden. Just having faced off Eden in his previous match and witnessing the fight between Brent and Joel, he had an inkling on the capabilities the fifteen-year-old boy could display. Humming to himself, he also noticed that although Brent was just at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he exuded more strength and showed more potential than Eden regarding battle force.</p>

  <p>Although it would have been a competitive and interesting battle, Luo Zheng planned to save his strength. Reserving his power was important when all he could think about was Marilyn's complete and utter defeat. As he made up his mind, he shook his head blandly and yelled out, "I refuse!" Reaching into his pocket, Luo Zheng took out and raised an exemption card.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the exemption card in Zheng's hand, the young boy pouted with a disgruntled expression. Even the crowd of spectators dissented in hush tones, inaudibly disappointed with what could have been an epic match between the two males.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng's first fight in the battle ring, his prowess caught the attention of many, most especially Brent's. Upon witnessing Zheng's successful maneuvers that defeated cultivators from the Internal Elixir Realm, Brent vowed to himself that he wanted to challenge him. The young boy's former plan was to battle Luo Zheng right after he finished Eden.</p>

  <p>However, he was unfortunately unable to carry out his plan since the two cultivators who he had wanted to fight ultimately ended up fighting with each other. Before he had a chance to choose Eden as his opponent, Luo Zheng had already defeated the other in the blink of an eye. With a total defeat, Eden's warrior spirit was even destroyed. Thus, Brent changed his plan and made Luo Zheng become his first target.</p>

  <p>Disappointed, he crossed his arms against his chest and slouched. "It looks like you don't have the guts to fight with me," the young boy gloomily stated. Nonetheless, he raised his eyebrow in challenge and urged the other man into action by provoking him. "Are you that scared to lose?"</p>

  <p>Shaking his head indifferently, Luo Zheng gave an unimpressed look to the other boy. The cultivator did not intend to respond to such childish provocation from someone younger than him. If fate allowed him, he would battle this boy and take him down a peg right after he was done defeating Marilyn.</p>

  <p>With pursed lips, Brent stomped back to the platform wherein the people from his sect were mumbling angrily among themselves. Uncrossing his arms, he gripped his challenge card tightly and he despondently thought, 'I just wanted to show everyone a good fight..'</p>

  <p>One of them sighed, dissatisfied. "I actually looked forward to watching Luo Zheng and Brent fight!"</p>
