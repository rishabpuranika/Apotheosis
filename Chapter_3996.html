<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the first time in their lives, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Ying, King Ieuan, and the Wing King could finally set foot in the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>This was a momentous achievement for all of them.</p>

  <p>This was a huge deal especially for the Wing King. Because no matter how powerful he was, he had never entered the Supreme Pure Realm yet.</p>

  <p>Because this was their first time there, it would make sense for them to be full of expectations. They were supposed to enjoy and celebrate this wonderful accomplishment.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had been missing for quite a while now. So instead of being excited, everyone's heart was heavy. This unfortunate occurrence had really dampened their spirits.</p>

  <p>They discussed at length Luo Zheng's possible current whereabouts after he left the Whining Road. For the entire day, they only talked about where he could be and how they could possibly find him.</p>

  <p>They were well-aware that talking about it while they were in the village would yield nothing. Still, it was obvious that Luo Zheng was extremely important to them.</p>

  <p>Deep within the hearts of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, they knew that Luo Zheng was the key to the completion of the Finale Way. He was their only hope.</p>

  <p>Even if it would cost them their lives, they definitely would not hesitate to save him.</p>

  <p>Twelve hours had passed by so quickly. Before they knew it, darkness had fallen once more.</p>

  <p>It was nighttime on the Whining Road again. Before long, they heard familiar noises in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were howling again. This had been happening for the past two nights already. They would appear as soon as the darkness had settled in.</p>

  <p>On the third night, the Snake Goddess merely continued counting the number of the Treacherous Beings out there in the dark.</p>

  <p>So far, she had counted one hundred ninety-eight of them.</p>

  <p>However, she suddenly discovered that some Treacherous Beings formed a strange shape on the Whining Road four hours later.</p>

  <p>She kept observing them and realized they were gathering within an area and were making a circle.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a strange and dazzling white light appeared at the center of the circle.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings as well as the white light were blinding. It was almost as if there was a sun shining at night.</p>

  <p>The bright light illuminated the entire area so much that the people inside the thick thatched hut were able to see them clearly.</p>

  <p>"What is that white light? Where is it coming from?"</p>

  <p>"Look! It is getting bigger and bigger."</p>

  <p>As the group watched this scene unfold right before their eyes, they noticed a change in the white light. Seeing this, they instantly had a guess as to what it was.</p>

  <p>As the expanding white light began taking shape, it seemed clear to everyone what was really happening.</p>

  <p>That specific Treacherous Being was being revived.</p>

  <p>It became clear that Luo Zheng made the right decision.</p>

  <p>If they had made the other choice earlier, they could still spend the second night safely, but it would not be the case this night.</p>

  <p>The third night would be riddled with danger. They were quite sure about this.</p>

  <p>It was sure as day that the Treacherous Beings would be able to find out they had occupied a thatched hut and attack them.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to hold off and stand against the Treacherous Beings by themselves.</p>

  <p>"I wished that Treacherous Being came after me instead of Luo Zheng," Ying sighed sadly. Her face was full of regret.</p>

  <p>She would've had gladly traded her life if it meant ensuring Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>She would do this in a heartbeat not only for the completion of the Finale Way, but also for Dorothy's sake.</p>

  <p>Everyone had seemed downcast ever since Luo Zheng's disappearance. They couldn't help but sigh and wish they could have done something.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Wing King kept observing the scene in the dark. All of a sudden, he spoke using his spiritual sense, "These Treacherous Beings don't seem like they have any sort of intelligence."</p>

  <p>His statement was met with looks of utter confusion from everyone in their group. They couldn't quite figure out how or why he came to this conclusion.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Zheng had already deciphered the conversations of the Treacherous Beings before.</p>

  <p>Obviously, this meant that they had their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, they were even able to resurrect their fallen companions.</p>

  <p>How could they not possess any intelligence?</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" The Snake Goddess walked towards the Wing King and asked. Her face was full of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems like they don't know that one of them is missing yet," replied the Wing King. "And whenever they aren't able to enter a thatched hut, they won't even try to force their way in to take a look. Instead, they will just move onto the next one. That way of doing things kind of strikes me as very mechanical," he added.</p>

  <p>If the Treacherous Beings gathered into a group, they would have noticed that one of them was missing and would set out to find their companion.</p>

  <p>Before the Wing King mentioned this, no one felt like there was anything wrong about them. But now that they thought about it, they realized how truly strange it was.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's true." Fuxi nodded slowly with a frown on his face. He was trying to recall what happened for the past two nights. "Whenever the Treacherous Beings came, I just propped the thatches up and they would just leave. No one ever tried to enter and check."</p>

  <p>"Hmm, but how can you explain they know to revive their companion?"</p>

  <p>Thurston questioned. He couldn't quite understand it.</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe they're just doing it instinctively." The Wing King made an assumption. It wasn't that far-fetched if they tried to think about it.</p>

  <p>"How about the Treacherous Being that possessed Luo Zheng? Does it also lack intelligence? If so, then why did it run away on its own?" Sawyer paced back and forth while trying to make sense of all this speculations.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tilted her head and was lost in thought for a while.</p>

  <p>"After that Treacherous Being found us and possessed Luo Zheng, the best move for it was not to run away. It should have woken up its companions and besieged us instead. What it did is indeed very strange."</p>

  <p>To sum it up, the Treacherous Beings' behavior was truly bizarre and incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>Hours passed and it was morning once more. They left the thatched hut and walked to the entrance of the Whining Road again.</p>

  <p>There were two rows of fences still standing on the left and right of the road. In the distance, they could still see the rolling white mist.</p>

  <p>"Well then, let's go! The Supreme Pure Realm is right ahead of us," exclaimed Fuxi confidently.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please climb onto my back. I'm afraid there will be more creatures guarding the entrance of the Whining Road," the Wing King reminded them as he lowered his wings slightly.</p>

  <p>Even though they had gotten rid of the two Shadow Warriors in the Grand Pure Realm, the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi still had the Shadow Marks on their skin.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Shadow Marks would last for five days. There was no way to erase them during this period.</p>

  <p>This meant that once they entered the Supreme Pure Realm through the Whining Road, they would definitely and immediately get noticed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're right. That settles it then," the Snake Goddess replied as she proceeded to climb up.</p>

  <p>One by one, they clambered onto the Wing King's back. As soon as everyone settled in, he stretched out his enormous wings and flew toward the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After they passed along the fences, they eagerly advanced through the rolling white mist.</p>

  <p>The two rows of fences functioned not only as the entrance but the exit as well.</p>

  <p>There were two different worlds on either side of the fences.</p>

  <p>Right after the Wing King swiftly soared out of the white mist, they saw a potholed swamp ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Most swamps were usually dangerous. No one knew what might be lurking in them. Now, the swamp in front of them was quite peculiar.</p>

  <p>Those deep recesses contained blood rather than normal swamp water. It looked a bit horrific.</p>

  <p>"Wow. This is the Blood Swamp. It has already expanded so much!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed in surprise. She did not expect it to be quite this expansive.</p>

  <p>However, the three Eternal Realm Hunters were not surprised when they saw the Blood Swamp. The expressions on their faces remained impassive.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Swamp will expand every thirty years and it will also shrink in another thirty years. Right now it's in the process of expanding. It's normal for it to expand up to the exit of the Whining Road," Pearson chimed in nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the three of you have already come to the Blood Swamp before," Fuxi observed.</p>

  <p>Pearson smiled. His expression revealed a hint of excitement. "Yes, we have. Moreover, we actually hid here for quite a long time. That's why we're very familiar with it."</p>

  <p>"Well then, please show us the way," the Snake Goddess said as she cupped her hands and bowed slightly at Pearson.</p>

  <p>"Our absolute priority now is to find Luo Zheng," Sawyer said with pure conviction.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Eternal Realm Hunters' goal was to hunt down Luo Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>But now, they had chosen to join this group instead because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Okay then. Let's get moving. Wing King, you said earlier that you are able to sense the Civilization Artifact. Can you sense Luo Zheng now?" the Snake Goddess inquired enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to try."</p>

  <p>The Wing King closed his eyes and a green light instantly rose above his head.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how far away he was. He could always communicate with the Civilization Artifact of the Green Jade Civilization any time. His bond to it was quite special. It was almost as though it was a part of his body.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>"The Green Jade Spirit." The Wing King's voice reached the Civilization Artifact and sounded from it.</p>

  <p>"Wing King." The Green Jade Spirit's response was immediate.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Luo Zheng is right now?" The Wing King promptly asked the question they had all been wanting to be answered.</p>

  <p>"After he left the Whining Road, he entered the Blood Swamp. He continues running wildly towards the north. He hasn't stopped yet." The Wing King sensed a deep anxiety in the Green Jade Spirit's tone.</p>

  <p>It was now clear that Luo Zheng's current situation was beyond their control.</p>
