<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a twinkle in Zheng's eyes as he stood.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he had extracted 99% of the strength source from the nine stars in his inner world!</p>

  <p>In addition, Zheng had turned the invisible strength into a huge net that swept towards the sky.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng could even leave everything behind and flee for his life if he chose to, thanks to his strength.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't a selfish man. He couldn't help but go all out every time.</p>

  <p>Then again, doing so allowed him to check how strong his power was when the nine stars were at their peak. For instance, the power he had currently released was equivalent to a third of a Holy Being's physical strength.</p>

  <p>Such power was so strong that it was difficult to measure it because it had already surpassed the existent standard.</p>

  <p>This level of strength was no doubt beyond words. Yet, it did not mean that Zheng truly had one-third of a Holy Being's strength.</p>

  <p>Physical strength was only one of the abilities of a warrior. A Holy Being or even a True God could increase such power by a tenfold or a hundredfold if they had used it. Such beings could use it to exterminate the over a hundred Formless Sky Pythons that were about to come.</p>

  <p>But Zheng could only use the power in a basic way. It was like when a child was given the sharpest knife in the world.</p>

  <p>The knife might be the best tool, but it wouldn't be used to its maximum in the hands of a child, whose knowledge and power were limited.</p>

  <p>"Roarrrr— " The net formed by Zheng's strength spread out and wrapped the Formless Sky Pythons inside it.</p>

  <p>Everyone was utterly shocked at the scene in front of them!</p>

  <p>It was because the Formless Sky Pythons looked like they were inside an invisible bag and held by a giant hand. The hand threw the invisible bag backwards with a loud boom, and the 40 Formless Sky Pythons in the front clashed with the over 50 Formless Sky Pythons at the back.</p>

  <p>The collision of the massive creatures caused an extremely powerful impact. The Formless Sky Pythons' bodies weren't able to endure the violent clash, so a few of them had gotten smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Pythons were clearly aggravated. Pained wails were heard from the grotesque, circular mouths.</p>

  <p>The whole scene looked like a bunch of tangled yarns as the beasts struggled madly to get out. But the more they struggled, the more they got entangled, and the harder it was for them to break free.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Kaydan knew that he shouldn't be distracted at the moment, he couldn't help but turn around when he heard the noise. As soon as he found what he was looking for, his breathing quickened and when he looked at Zheng, reverence filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>Before, he viewed Zheng as a secondary creature who wasn't even worth mentioning. He thought that Zheng couldn't possible lead their exploration, and that he was merely a key to be used at a crucial moment. The first day that Zheng had entered the Skyland race, his performance had made Kaydan change his opinion of him.</p>

  <p>His strength was truly undeniable, and so Kaydan had treated him as their equal. It was already an extremely rare occurrence in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>After all, the entire Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was the territory of this group of aboriginals. The six races had never taken warriors of the other races seriously.</p>

  <p>Although it was just like when Pascal had once been the leader of the Collapsing Mountain race, he hadn't actually convinced all the warriors in the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Now, however, Kaydan understood that he had really underestimated this Zheng. When he first tested Zheng's strength on the first day they met in the Skyland race, Zheng might've held back his true strength.</p>

  <p>Kaydan wasn't the only one who began to see Zheng in a new light.</p>

  <p>Chapman had a glimpse of Zheng's strength before. The man had displayed a terrifying force of strength back when he had fought against the Martial Sacred Beast. Chapman reckoned that by that time, Zheng's strength was at its limit, or was really close to it.</p>

  <p>It was quite hard for him to comprehend that this young man at the Spirit Supreme Realm actually had such terrifying power. He couldn't help but be in awe at the thought of it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Chapman and the other Collapsing Mountain warriors simply looked at Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>Back then when Zheng took the test of strength by pushing the Magic Golden Stone, the test had failed to measure his strength because the distance in the square wasn't enough. Now they knew that even if the square had an ample distance, it would still be unable to test Zheng's limits.</p>

  <p>The brat's strength alone was enough to block dozens of Formless Sky Pythons. Even better was that Zheng had casually thrown them out like rags. Just how powerful was he?</p>

  <p>Had he exerted such force on that Magic Golden Stone, he would've thrown it at an infinitely far away distance. Such tests were actually meaningless to Zheng. Even the title of wild king was just a joke to him.</p>

  <p>The Harmony race mainly cultivated their minds, and their mental states were further enhanced with the tempering of the Mind Refining Tower.</p>

  <p>Ordinary matters of life and death couldn't even cause any fluctuations in their state of mind, so the warriors of the Harmony race were the calmest. They didn't even panic when over a hundred Formless Sky Pythons rushed towards them like a torrent.</p>

  <p>The impact of one's state of mind on a martial artist didn't seem to be a lot, but it played an important role at critical moments. It was because even a small trace of panic meant a complete failure. Only with a calm mind could one find the solution to get out of a crisis.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, the power that Zheng had displayed had still set off a storm in the hearts of the warriors of the Harmony race.</p>

  <p>"A warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm shouldn't have this much power-</p>

  <p>-and, he is a secondary creature!"</p>

  <p>Tilton also knew from Kaydan and Chapman that Zheng was an extraordinary warrior. The issue however was that, the Zheng they saw now was more than extraordinary. He was a freak that no words could even describe.</p>

  <p>Just then, that unimaginably overwhelming power only lasted for a few seconds before it quietly dissipated.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Zheng looked healthy and full of spirit.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, both of his legs went weak and he collapsed on the ground. He had been drained of strength.</p>

  <p>He was so out of energy that he couldn't even lift his head, open his eyelids, or maintain his heartbeat. After his heart stopped pumping, his body's blood flow quickly slowed down, then his face was almost devoid of color.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" Liusu was the closest to Zheng, so she immediately rushed to him and lifted him up.</p>

  <p>"Did he overuse his strength?" Chapman ran over and asked. Soon enough, the rest of them also came over.</p>

  <p>The excessive consumption of strength usually happened only to body refiners. This was because no matter how much power a person had used, it would not be completely depleted.</p>

  <p>Warriors who cultivated life vitality normally used life vitality to fight, and the body's strength was only secondary. They were even less likely to exhaust their strength to such an extent, unless the battle lasted for several days or even months.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the situation for body refiners was a bit more complicated because they had better control of their strength. They had learned to squeeze out all of their power after years of cultivation.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was that if a body refiner had consumed all the power in the Eight Path Platforms, the Eight Path Platforms in their body would continue to absorb the power of the martial artist's physical body.</p>

  <p>It was an automatic process, and part of the body refiner's instincts.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's situation was a bit more special.</p>

  <p>What he consumed was the power of the Nine Divine Stars. Only a moment ago did he decide that he'd draw out 99% of the power of the Nine Divine Stars. He did not use the power of the Eight Path Platforms, nor did he use his main body's power.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that there would be a price to pay for draining all of his strength.</p>

  <p>It was taboo to drain all the powers of such sources, whether it was the Nine Divine Stars or the Eight Path Platforms. Without the nourishment of the strength source, the Nine Divine Stars and the Eight Path Platforms wouldn't be able to sustain themselves, and might even collapse after.</p>

  <p>The Nine Divine Stars' power was almost completely depleted, and since they didn't have enough time to replenish their power through chaotic energy, they could only draw power from the Eight Path Platforms.</p>

  <p>However, the Eight Path Platforms' power was almost nothing compared to the power within the Nine Divine Stars. The two weren't actually in the same league.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the power in Zheng's Eight Path Platforms dried up immediately and in turn, the Eight Path Platforms began to absorb the power from Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical body was the last resort of the supply of power. The problem was, his body only didn't have so much power in it.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's physical body had been drained of its power, he suddenly found everything turn into a blur before he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the consequence… too grave?" Even Zheng didn't expect such a result.</p>
