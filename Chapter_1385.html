  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This brat… he dared to break into the flame pool!"</p>

  <p>"Anyone who touches the Immortal Profound Flame is doomed to be burned into ashes! Is this kid not afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had stood in front of the pool for quite a while and all the leaders thought he would eventually give up and turn away. However, one could imagine their shock when he actually went and jumped into the pool!</p>

  <p>The Immortal Profound Flame was an inextinguishable fire that would never cease to glow. If one valued their life then one would choose to steer clear of it, and it would be a blind faith if one chose to continue moving forward.</p>

  <p>All these leaders had extensive knowledge and experience of the world while their strength could be considered close to the level of world lords.</p>

  <p>But despite their wisdom, it seemed they could still be surprised.</p>

  <p>"Sir, shouldn't we bring that kid back?" one of the leaders asked the Sunset World lord. The world lord pondered for a moment. It would be quite a pity if such an extraordinary warrior like Zheng died in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>Layla was definitely set to be admitted to the Spring Fragrance Pavilion.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, would probably be sent to the Gauze Pavilion!</p>

  <p>There was no way the Sunset World lord could allow this young man to die. He suddenly stood up and prepared to go after him!</p>

  <p>A world lord's stride could cross tens of thousands of miles in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, a gentle voice froze him in place, "Sir, please wait…"</p>

  <p>The sound of Yolande's voice caused a strange expression to appear on the Sunset World lord's face, "Oh? What is it?"</p>

  <p>"There's no need to bring Zheng out. He… He won't perish," she told him.</p>

  <p>She had initially been worried about Zheng and also thought conclusions of these leaders were indeed reasonable, and she could also predict what would happen if Zheng stepped into the flame pool.</p>

  <p>However, after thinking more about it, she realized that Zheng was not someone who would do something so recklessly. Since he had chosen to move forward, then he probably knew what he was doing. There was no need to worry about him.</p>

  <p>These leaders' worries were reasonable and not unfounded but Zheng had proven time and again that he wasn't someone that could be judged by common standards.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord stood his ground after hearing Yolande's words.</p>

  <p>He stood back and looked towards the place where the young man had vanished. He too wanted to see if Zheng would make it.</p>

  <p>With this, the many leaders' worries abated, especially when they saw what happened to him next.</p>

  <p>Within the flame pool, they witnessed that Zheng was moving forward at a fast pace!</p>

  <p>The entire flame pool was only two hundred miles wide.</p>

  <p>His speed wasn't slow so it wouldn't take too much time for him to pass through it.</p>

  <p>In fact, after five minutes, one of the leaders could only mumble in a daze, "He has passed it…"</p>

  <p>"He's already traveled thirty thousand miles. This kid's speed has increased once again!"</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand and five hundred miles!"</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent, including the leaders and the warriors at the side of the square.</p>

  <p>Even Layla was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>She remembered her master telling her that she would be the main character, nay, the star of this era.</p>

  <p>But what was this? Why did someone such as Zheng suddenly come and make her pale in comparison?</p>

  <p>She dazedly pulled the blue butterfly ornament off her hair and kneaded it in her hand.</p>

  <p>This ornament was incredibly vivid and was also a second-rank divine weapon of supporting functions. The blue butterfly also had its own special origin.</p>

  <p>Layla always wore this ornament above her right ear. During times of extreme frustration, she would often take off an accessory from her body and knead it in her hand.</p>

  <p>Cracks suddenly began to appear as she continued kneading the second-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a small, shattering sound snapped her out of her reverie.</p>

  <p>Layla looked down at her hand and found that the butterfly wings had crumbled and broke in two. Then the whole ornament became numerous pieces in her hand.</p>

  <p>A second-rank divine weapon was invaluable and destroying one was not an easy feat. She had obviously used her life vitality to destroy it, causing it to shatter.</p>

  <p>It was only when the ornament had been reduced to dust that she raised her head. Her eyes flashed with a strong aura!</p>

  <p>"I won't lose. Not to someone like you,  Zheng Luo!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>She could accept her loss at this time in the Enchanted Barrier Tower but there were other tests to be accomplished in Passing the Torch. She did not feel discouraged despite this setback.</p>

  <p>However, the price to set her mood back on track was high. The fine dust of the former second-rank divine weapon was proof of her rage but it served to further strengthen her conviction. Compared to those talents who lost and were unable to recover from the heavy blow, Layla's warrior spirit was relatively strong.</p>

  <p>Amidst everyone's silence, Zheng continued to break through.</p>

  <p>Thirty-one thousand miles…</p>

  <p>Thirty-two thousand miles…</p>

  <p>Thirty-three thousand miles…</p>

  <p>There was no limit to how far he could go. Nobody could predict when he would stop.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until he reached thirty-six thousand miles that he halted.</p>

  <p>And only because there was a lightning waterfall in front of him.</p>

  <p>The lightning contained the power of the Water Law which resulted in its peculiar, waterfall-like movement.</p>

  <p>The intense power of thunder and lightning collided and emitted a dazzling light. This electric waterfall exuded a far more intense power than the previous flame pool he jumped into before. There was no doubt that this was also another 'masterpiece' created by some Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply stood in front of this waterfall.</p>

  <p>He probably had a chance to cross it but was there really a need to take that risk?</p>

  <p>Sure, it was important to test one's limits but there was a fine line that must be drawn between guts and reckless stupidity. He could die if he wasn't careful.</p>

  <p>The only reason he was so confident to cross the flame pool earlier was because his body was immune to the attack of the Fire Law. All he needed to do then was to grit his teeth and run.</p>

  <p>However, the power of thunder and lightning was another story.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng summoned the Ancestral Dragon and let it devour the Immortal Profound Flame that was on him!</p>

  <p>After he passed through the flame pool, Zheng hadn't put the Ancestral Dragon back into the spirit beast bag but instead had it accompany him along the way.</p>

  <p>The little dragon seemed unaffected by the Law Power and was able to fly freely in the storm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng used the Immortal Profound Flame to temper his physical body, not really in any hurry to extinguish the flame after passing through the flame pool. Since the golden vortexes were absorbing the Immortal Profound Flame unceasingly, he would just let them be.</p>

  <p>Numerous golden vortexes began to close up, absorbing the Immortal Profound Flame. Zheng had to get rid of it now because Xun had reminded him that he would walk out of here with the ball of Immortal Profound Flame on him. But he didn't think it would be acceptable if others saw him like this.</p>

  <p>After the Ancestral Dragon completely devoured the Immortal Profound Flame, it burped loudly, indicating that it had eaten its fill.</p>

  <p>Zheng then stretched his hand out towards the little dragon.</p>

  <p>With a snort, the Ancestral Dragon obediently went towards him and Zheng stuffed it inside the spirit beast bag. His actions seemed to have displeased it as the little dragon moved wildly for a little bit before finally becoming still.</p>

  <p>With the extinguished Immortal Profound Flame, Zheng's molten red body finally began to cool down.</p>

  <p>His tempered physique had once again risen another level though he couldn't be too sure what rank he had reached since he didn't see any evidence of divine textures on his chest. He could only figure it out in the future.</p>

  <p>However, his strength still increased greatly!</p>

  <p>To test this out, Zheng began to condense the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>The surging power quickly rushed into his body!</p>

  <p>One thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Three thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Five thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Fifteen thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>He had already activated all the dragon scales that had been lit up, but he felt nothing different in his body. All he could feel was the raw power surging through his veins!</p>

  <p>He clenched his fist and marveled at how such a small action could release such a huge force that actually distorted the surrounded space!</p>

  <p>It seemed that he would need to collect more heavenly essence…</p>
