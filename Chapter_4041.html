<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4041 The Strange Pattern </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew ahead of the group. Just as he was about to reach the lake shore, he spread out his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>The spiritual sense was a handy method of surveying one's surroundings; it made studying things at a distance easier, and even the things hidden underground could be detected by it.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng's spiritual sense swept over the terrain beside the lake, a strange image suddenly appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>It was a circle with ten animal teeth hanging around it!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The circle spun violently, and the animal teeth began to flash ominously.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his mind, which made him almost cry out.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and three Eternal Realm Hunters also released their spiritual senses, as Luo Zheng did. They also saw the circular pattern. In unison, they all started crying out in pain.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>"What is that? It hurts!"</p>

  <p>"My spiritual sense is affected..."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng came to his senses, he glanced back at the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the rest in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Do you see anything with your spiritual sense?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"A ring with ten teeth embedded in it," Pearson replied concisely.</p>

  <p>"I saw it, too! Squeak! Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed with a pained expression.</p>

  <p>Fuxi studied the bank of the lake in the distance, his forehead creasing in fear.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, one should be able to send out their spiritual sense unimpeded. However, some special things could block the spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>There were even more powerful things and creatures that could devour the spiritual sense, causing it to disappear without a trace.</p>

  <p>This time, their spiritual senses didn't bounce back or disappear after moving around the area. However, what their spiritual senses revealed was the ring inlaid with teeth.</p>

  <p>This was very strange, as though someone had deliberately shown them this.</p>

  <p>Everyone discussed in low voices, but they couldn't seem to come to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked Campbell about it, but even Campbell was confused. "The Night View Island is a relatively large Pure Sky Platform, and we haven't arranged anything on it," he said. "I've never heard of the ability of affecting the spiritual sense that you just mentioned..."</p>

  <p>As the builder of the world, Campbell was very familiar with the chaos and even the worlds outside it, but even his knowledge was limited here.</p>

  <p>"I'll go ashore first, and you follow me," suggested Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The people present had witnessed Luo Zheng's almost endless life energy, so they all nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew to the lakeshore quickly. He was about to land on a large boulder.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The second Luo Zheng's foot stepped on the rock, a sickeningly loud explosion went off in his ears. His forehead seemed to have been hit hard by a heavy wooden stick. The moment his mind went blank, the ring inlaid with teeth appeared again!</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Luo Zheng frowned, wincing in pain.</p>

  <p>Although what just happened was a bit strange, Luo Zheng figured it was still safe enough to call the others. Luo Zheng still said to the Snake Goddess, "You all can come over now. Be careful when you land. There seems to be a strange spiritual attack..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded and went ashore with Fuxi and the others.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Snake Goddess landed on the ground, she was also hit heavily. Her face turned pale, but after a while, she seemed to gather her bearings.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Ying and the rest.</p>

  <p>The reactions of King Ieuan and Fuxi were the greatest. They fell on their knees, writhing in pain.</p>

  <p>Campbell, on the other hand, landed with ease. He was the only one who didn't feel anything when he stepped on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I saw that ring again..."</p>

  <p>"There is no spiritual attack nearby...."</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was filled with worry, especially the three Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>They had lived in a dangerous environment for so long, and they were trained to stay vigilant at all times. If they were not careful enough, they were in danger stumbling on death's door. Usually, when they encountered this phenomenon which was hard to explain, they figured the best they could do was to keep highly vigilant and be suspicious of everything.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, try to communicate with the Civilization Artifact again," Luo Zheng said to the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had already been prepared. With Luo Zheng's order, he appeared on the top of the book. As the pages were turned, the Civilization Artifact tried to contact the real human heroes.</p>

  <p>The energy souls of the real human heroes, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Emperor Di Jun, Zhurong and the others, also gathered around the book. They all wanted to know the result as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash...</p>

  <p>The pages stopped moving, and it began to glow with a green light.</p>

  <p>The energy souls of human heroes immediately connected to the book, trying to accept the information that was transmitted from the book.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The reaction of these energy souls was exactly the same as that of Luo Zheng and the others when they landed on the shore. They had also been attacked and seen the ring with ten teeth...</p>

  <p>Although the energy souls still had their powerful theurgies, they were very weak in terms of soul. A stronger soul attack was enough to seriously injure them.</p>

  <p>However, the ring's attack did not cause any damage. It only made the people who saw it wince in pain.</p>

  <p>Although these energy souls covered their heads and cried for help, thankfully, they were not injured at all.</p>

  <p>"Even the Civilization Artifact can be affected..." Luo Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>"The Night View Island might be enveloped by some kind of magical power. You can only explore it with your physical bodies," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. They had come a long way to get here, and it was futile for them to even consider giving up.</p>

  <p>Although the Night View Island was by no means small, they hoped to be able to gather some clues around the ominous-looking mountains.</p>

  <p>Surrounding the lake shore was a greyish-white forest.</p>

  <p>When he was flying past the lake earlier, he saw that everything on the Night View Island was grey-white, and now even the forest was in the same color. Out of curiosity, he went forward and picked a leaf. As soon as he took the leaf from a tree, a layer of grey-white ashes fell to the ground, revealing a large emerald leaf.</p>

  <p>It turned out that these trees were not grey-white, but their surfaces were covered in a layer of ashes!</p>

  <p>"Is there any volcano on the Night View Island?" The Snake Goddess's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>If there were any volcanoes on this island that erupted, it would explain why the entire place was covered in ashes.</p>

  <p>Fuxi shrugged as he reached out to pick a leaf. Cautiously, he sniffed at the dust on the leaf, and said, "This is not volcanic ash. There is no smell of sulfur."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also asked for confirmation from Campbell. Campbell said that there was no volcano set up on the island when the Night View Island was built.</p>

  <p>"There has to be some reason why there's dust all over the island..." Sawyer scratched his chin, pondering aloud.</p>

  <p>"No." Pearson shook his head and pointed at a place not far away. "Look, the ashes are not evenly distributed. Only the flowers and trees have ashes, but there is no dust in other places..."</p>

  <p>After careful observation, Luo Zheng and the others found that what Pearson said was true.</p>

  <p>Except for the flowers and trees, there was no ash on the rocks and the ground.</p>

  <p>"This is very strange," the Snake Goddess said with a deep frown. "Either the ashes belong to the plants, or they have been sprinkled on them by someone..."</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was confused, Luo Zheng saw something from the corner of his eye. Turning to see what it was, he was surprised to see that a white claw stretched out from one of the trees with a handful of ashes, carefully sprinkling them on the leaves.</p>

  <p>The emerald leaves Luo Zheng just dusted were now covered in grey-white ashes once more.</p>
