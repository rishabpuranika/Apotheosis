<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I respect you for being a newcomer. You are talented. You defeated Leo, which I admire. So I gave you advice that was well-intentioned. I have shown you the right way to deal with this matter. Don't make things worse." Seeing that his words hadn't changed Luo Zheng's mind, Liam's tone suddenly hardened. He never thought that Luo Luo Zheng would be so proud and unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? What is the right way? What will make things worse? I don't like nonsense. If you don't agree with me, then face me in the battle ring," Luo Luo Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>"Settling disputes in the battle ring is not the only way to solve a problem. I suggest that both of you compromise. Then the situation will not escalate," another disciple interjected. Luo Luo Zheng turned to the disciple who had just spoken only to find a man with a big, fat face smiling at him.</p>

  <p>"Wurth, are you here to poke your nose into my business?" Liam's expression showed the agitation he felt when he saw Wurth.</p>

  <p>The fat man, Wurth Zhang, was ranked 7th among the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak. From among the ten thousand outer disciples, he was definitely a top master. As a grin spread across Wurth's face, two front teeth were revealed. "Well, your business? I don't accept what you just said. Liam, I know that you have a good relationship with the Zhuge family, but you should not support this servant. The slave is spoiled and defiant. He is proud of being?a slave of the Zhuge family. His behavior is superior and supercilious. He seems to forget that he is just a slave.</p>

  <p>Even a slave to the Emperor's family is still a slave! He shouldn't feel superior to other people. In my opinion, killing him is too harsh. But we should not let him go easily either. How about this. Luo Luo Zheng, you can teach him a lesson with your fist! It is better that both of you make some concessions on this matter!"</p>

  <p>Wurth Zhang had made an interesting point. A faint smile grew on Luo Zheng's face. Although Wurth seemed to be fair and unselfish, anybody could see that he was feigning fairness. He was actually helping Luo Luo Zheng. Most people understood that Luo Luo Zheng would not kill Thomas. But they knew that Luo Luo Zheng was angry and that he had a temper. They also knew that he needed to maintain his power and prestige.</p>

  <p>As a result of Wurth's explanation, Luo Luo Zheng now had the opportunity to?hit Thomas, even though it sounded like both sides had reached a compromise.</p>

  <p>Liam clenched his teeth and then stepped away.</p>

  <p>Liam was already somewhat jealous and fearful of the strength that Luo Luo Zheng? had shown to all. And now Wurth was officious. Liam was unable to protect Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, now you can teach Thomas a lesson," ?said Wurth. A sly smile grew on Wurth's face as he stressed on the word 'lesson'.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and seized the back of Thomas' neck. At that moment, Thomas' eyes flashed red. "Luo Luo Zheng, if you beat me to death, my master will destroy you and your family, and grind your bones to dust!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head calmly. He was so tired of these hollow threats.</p>

  <p>Couldn't they think of something new to threaten him with? He flipped his palms and slapped Thomas. Then he landed a mighty blow on Thomas' chest. Thomas suddenly flew back and rolled on the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, everyone was surprised. They felt the punishment inflicted on Thomas was too mild. Luo Luo Zheng should beat him harder.</p>

  <p>Thomas got up from the ground. Instead of showing the convergence necessary, he kept threatening Luo Luo Zheng. He didn't seem injured. To the crowd's surprise, just as he stood up straight, a dull explosion sounded from within his body.</p>

  <p>"Puff, pu-ff..."</p>

  <p>Four holes sprayed blood from his hands and feet. Thomas screamed and fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>"What a good blow!"</p>

  <p>"Well done, Luo Luo Zheng. This idiot deserved that. He dared to cause trouble in Drizzle Peak. Just see how his life ends!"</p>

  <p>From among the spectators, several people looked at Luo Luo Zheng and cheered him with words of praise. But most were silent. They didn't echo the sentiment of the cheering people. They knew that this matter would not come to a good end. Fren was not known to be kind and reasonable. On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng was not from a noble clan. He was helpless. He had no one, and no clan would protect him. They believed that he wouldn't stay in Drizzle Peak for long...</p>

  <p>"You just entered Cloud Sect, and you've already offended the Zhuge family. Aren't you afraid?" Wurth asked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. He was not afraid of anything. He turned to Wurth and said,</p>

  <p>"I have offended many powerful and talented people. It's awful, but I have been used to it. That's a waste of time wondering about this. I have a long way to go."</p>

  <p>"Good point! You got a heroic spirit! Courage is?the most essential trait of a hero. How about we have a drink to celebrate?" Wurth suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not say much. He grabbed Nory and Sean and then followed Wurth. Along the way, they joked and chatted freely with each other, as if they were old friends.</p>

  <p>Standing in a small building not far away, Master Su breathed a sigh of relief. She had been anxious about the fight and the tense situation down there. Luo Luo Zheng was indeed not easily defeated. She always knew that he was not what he seemed. Not only did he beat Leo, but he had also offended the Zhuge family, a powerful noble clan.</p>

  <p>This was beneficial for him. Master Su believed that a person only made rapid progress when under extreme pressure.</p>

  <p>The Zhuge family would retaliate now.</p>

  <p>Master Su's eyes blinked as she dwelled on that thought for a moment. 'I need to stand up for him. Lady Autumn from Zhuge family owes me a favor!' Master Su now had a plan!</p>
