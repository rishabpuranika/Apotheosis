<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1031 Mu Ning Summoned The Swords </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Eddie did not fully understand the principles behind the Life and Death Wind but that did not mean that he couldn't use it to kill other people.</p>

  <p>Using the Life and Death Wind had permanent, negative effects on Eddie which subjected him to a considerable amount of risk whenever he used it.</p>

  <p>It was always a last resort option but since he needed to win this battle, then he would have no choice but to go all out.</p>

  <p>The fragment in front of him flickered with a multitude of colors. One glance would be able to tell anyone that this was no ordinary item and Eddie briefly wondered if this was the "big secret" Master Wallace had been talking about before.</p>

  <p>In Eddie's opinion, Luo Luo Zheng was a kid who had too many secrets. It would greatly benefit him if he could obtain Luo Zheng's secrets, so Luo Luo Zheng must be killed as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He walked towards the young man with the aim of taking that piece of fragment from him. However, an extremely sharp sword radiance suddenly shot out towards him from outside the city wall!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance contained an intimidating momentum as it flew through the air.</p>

  <p>There was no time to react, not even Eddie himself could avoid the sword in time. Swift and sure, it was as if the sword represented the heavens that had come to punish Eddie for his sins.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>The blade slashed at Eddie's wrist and successfully cut off one of his hands.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a young man atop the city walls collapsed onto the green bricks below. The pressure he had exerted upon himself was evident by the two, thick streams of pitch-black blood beside him.</p>

  <p>Tianming lay on the brick with his sword in his arms. It took everything in him to make that strike and he had almost lost his life.</p>

  <p>'What a pity? It actually missed the vital parts, ' he thought to himself regretfully before fully passing out.</p>

  <p>But in truth, cutting off Eddie's hand was already a huge accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Tianming, after all, was only an Internal Elixir Realm warrior but the power of his Heavenly Sword was perhaps already on par with that of the Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>His strike combined the natural law of the heavens! Tianming's Heavenly Sword had gathered heaven's momentum and conformed to the heavenly wishes. If he followed this path and ventured deeper in his cultivation, then Tianming's future achievements might actually rival Luo Zheng's!</p>

  <p>"That attack just now came from an Internal Elixir Realm warrior."</p>

  <p>"Yes! It is Tianming from the Cloud Hall who did it. Apparently, the Heavenly Sword he comprehended had enough power to kill a Virtual Tribulation Realm master. It seems it is actually true!"</p>

  <p>"What a pity that so many extraordinary warriors of the World Commercial Alliance and Cloud Hall are about to be destroyed. Cutting off one of Eddie's hands is not going to help their case at all."</p>

  <p>The sight of his severed hand drew Eddie into a foul mood. He glared at where Tianming had collapsed, his face full of killing intent. Eddie could always mend the severed limb but the new replacement would need to be cultivated from scratch lest it became a weakness in his body.</p>

  <p>If he had the time, Eddie would've surely killed Tianming for what he did but there were more important matters at hand. He had to obtain Luo Zheng's secret!</p>

  <p>He stretched out his injured limb to stop the blood from flowing and then reached out for the fragment with his other hand.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that he felt a shadow pass over his head. Eddie immediately reached out and grabbed what seemed to be a thick and heavy sword. It was a sword that came from the Purple Power World!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the sky opened up as countless gigantic swords rained down upon him, forcing him to retreat!</p>

  <p>A graceful figure appeared along the edge of the battlefield. Mu Ning looked like a pure lotus flower with her white robe and snow-white skin.</p>

  <p>She immediately rushed over to Luo Luo Zheng and felt the cold Mu Ning that emanated from his body. Her heart dropped to her stomach when she realized that she couldn't feel any signs of life in his body.</p>

  <p>Eddie had been pushed back several dozen feet by the rain of giant swords and the sight of this person agitated him. Luo Luo Zheng was almost completely dead but how come so many insignificant people suddenly appeared to protect him?</p>

  <p>That young man truly had a lucky destiny. Even at the brink of death, he couldn't let Eddie end his life so easily.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not really know much about what was happening. She couldn't tell that Luo Luo Zheng had sustained many injuries, nor did she know what the fragment in his chest was for, or if he was even still alive?</p>

  <p>She only knew that the person in front of her had been the one to make Luo Luo Zheng like this.</p>

  <p>The decimation of the Xi Clan led to Luo Luo Zheng being the only person Mu Ning could ever rely on. She knew that he did not regard her that highly and she did not even dare ask him to make her his wife?</p>

  <p>But she still treated Luo Luo Zheng like her husband and thought of him as the only person she could rely on for the rest of her life.</p>

  <p>Her eyes became cold as she glared at Eddie who was not far away with killing intent.</p>

  <p>Eddie returned her gaze indifferently. He would've been interested in her in the past but she was useless to him now that her virginity energy was gone.</p>

  <p>He could care less about what she thought or how she felt, or how strong she was.</p>

  <p>Back then, Eddie had used a secret technique to help Marilyn to activate her Purple Power Body. Although the Purple Power Body was powerful, it was also restricted by the warrior's cultivation level. This woman in front of him was only at the primary stage of the Internal Elixir Realm and posed no threat to Eddie whatsoever.</p>

  <p>"There are a lot of accounts that we must settle between us," Mu Ning spoke. "The lives of our clan, my great-grandfather, and thousands upon thousands of Ethereal Spirit Sect's disciples? you must pay for all of them!"</p>

  <p>Eddie gave her a sarcastic smile, "Oh? How exactly do you plan to settle them?" His tone was mocking as he looked down upon her.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's eyes turned cold. "By killing you!"</p>

  <p>Eddie looked around. "Just you?" Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance still had many fighters but they were in no shape to attack. The Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors seemed to be fully aware of their limits but this stupid woman in front of him was not the slightest bit afraid to face him...</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mu Ning murmured. "Just me."</p>

  <p>A simple wave of her hand wiped the mocking grin away from Eddie's face.</p>

  <p>For the sky was once again commanded to rain down its punishment.</p>

  <p>One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a million - the gigantic swords had suddenly appeared and were now continuously multiplying in the sky.</p>

  <p>The number of swords was innumerable and it was enough to plunge Oracle City in darkness.</p>

  <p>Those on the ground could only gaze up to the sky in combined awe and horror.</p>

  <p>Many had already been witnesses to the power of the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Luo Zheng fought Marilyn, everyone had been amazed by the huge swords that had appeared out of nowhere. The swift sword strikes had been dazzling to the point that the audience couldn't distinguish between Luo Zheng's sword and the ones that Marilyn had summoned.</p>

  <p>But that battle only featured several dozen blades.</p>

  <p>The brewing fight right in front of them was an entirely different matter.</p>

  <p>Above Oracle City, the sky had been transformed into a field of gigantic swords.</p>

  <p>Just how many Heavenly Evil Sect disciples would survive once the rain of swords poured down from the heavens?</p>

  <p>It was only then that Eddie realized his mistake. "You!" he pointed an accusatory finger to Mu Ning. "H-How did you do that?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning sneered and, with a flick of a finger, more swords rained down upon the battlefield.</p>

  <p>She was someone who possessed the best physique in the Purple Power World: a top grade Purple Power Body. The number of swords she could summon was naturally more than what an ordinary Purple Power Body could ever hope for.</p>

  <p>The several million swords she had summoned was not even the peak of her abilities. So long as she was prepared to pay the price, Mu Ning could summon all 99 billion swords and destroy the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>But of course, that would be overkill.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Quickly, run!"</p>

  <p>"We can't escape! There are swords everywhere!"</p>

  <p>"Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>Huge swords continued their barrage onto the ground below, slicing all warriors into muddy flesh.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred thousand Heavenly Evil Sect warriors were killed in a manner of seconds.</p>

  <p>Only Simon and a few Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors were able to survive against Xi Youqin's tirade of attacks.</p>

  <p>The battlefield resembled hell on earth. Once the swords disappeared, all that remained were blood, flesh, and mud.</p>

  <p>Eddie could only look in disbelief at the scene in front of him. His grim expression signaled a storm that loomed over all of them.</p>
