</p>

  <p>After Zheng was handcuffed, he took a look at the materials the shackles were made of— it made him shake his head.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the Upper World's resources weren't as exaggerated as he had imagined. The shackles were a mere mid-grade sacred weapon— managing to bind him was wishful thinking. Although there were some mystical divine textures on the shackles, Zheng was confident that he could break through them with his own strength.</p>

  <p>But just as the armored warriors said, there was no need for him to make anything difficult for them. He was facing several Soul Sea Realm warriors, after all— with his current strength, he couldn't make a complete escape.</p>

  <p>Even after ascending into the Spirit Reading World, he was well aware of the need to act according to his circumstances— he was no longer the reckless young man that lacked patience.</p>

  <p>With the shackles on Zheng, an armored warrior took him to a nearby pavilion.</p>

  <p>Before the armored warrior left him be, Zheng suddenly felt some movement in his spirit beast bag, followed by a cackling sound.</p>

  <p>It made the armored warrior give Zheng a curious look. "You actually brought a spirit beast with you when you ascended to the Upper World?</p>

  <p>Is that a contractual beast?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the question, Zheng thought he would be in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was something the Celestial Position race was after, which meant that it was very valuable. If anyone found out it was with Zheng, he would be cornered. In the calmest tone he could manage, he smiled and said, "Yes, it's a contractual beast captured in the Lower World."</p>

  <p>With a nod, the armored warrior turned and left. After all, in the eyes of the Upper World warriors, there couldn't be anything of interest from the Lower World. Luckily, for Zheng, that particular armored warrior was too lazy to check his bag.</p>

  <p>"How dangerous!" Zheng muttered to himself when the armored warrior was out of sight. "Hey, don't make any noise." He patted the spirit beast bag. "If anyone catches you, I won't be able to save you."</p>

  <p>After a few days of growth, the Ancestral Dragon had the intelligence equal to that of an eight or nine-year-old child, and understood Zheng's words well enough.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng ascended, Margaret had cooked heaps of food to pack into the spirit beast bag. It was likely that the Ancestral Dragon had already eaten it all.</p>

  <p>With the body of a divine weapon, the Ancestral Dragon didn't actually need to eat at all— all it needed to do was absorb the vitality of heaven and earth to grow. But because Margaret had spoiled it with delicious food, it became rather picky. It seemed that it wasn't pleased having to stay in the bag after filling himself up with a feast.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's threat was rather effective. The Ancestral Dragon treated him as its "mother," after all, and was too afraid of being separated from Zheng to act recklessly. After Zheng's warning, it curled up in the bag without making another sound.</p>

  <p>For nearly half a month, Zheng waited.</p>

  <p>In the first week, none of the warriors who ascended were able to enter the pavilion. It was only on the tenth day that the first warrior arrived— a woman in plain clothes and shackles around her hands. When she sized Zheng up, her eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>It seemed that she had a good understanding of the Upper World's rules, something that others usually lacked. She knew that it wasn't easy to adapt to the vitality of heaven and earth after leaving the Ascending Well.</p>

  <p>Even with that knowledge, it had taken her ten whole days to leave the Ascending Well, while it took Zheng only five minutes to adapt to the vitality— the difference in ability made her incomparable to the man before her.</p>

  <p>Taking a seat beside Zheng, she went straight to the point. "How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>With a polite smile, Zheng asked, "What?"</p>

  <p>"How did you adapt to the vitality of heaven and earth in such a short period of time?" After a moment, a thought came to her. "There is only one explanation— you're not a warrior from the Lower World. You must be from the Upper World— you descended to the Lower World and ascended back here. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Her deduction put a stunned look on Zheng's face as he immediately shook his head. "I'm not from the Upper World."</p>

  <p>Pouting her lips, the woman was certain that Zheng wasn't telling the truth.</p>

  <p>With a calm smile, she said, "If you really are from the Lower World, then you will be greatly valued in the future!"</p>

  <p>In spite of her skepticism, Zheng maintained a calm demeanor as he gazed at the Ascending Wells in the distance.</p>

  <p>As Zheng kept quiet, the woman continued, "Actually, one of my uncles is the lord of the Blue City of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. After we leave this place, I can go and join him. If you have nowhere else to go, you can come with me."</p>

  <p>In response to her offer, Zheng merely glanced at her indifferently. When they were in the Ascending Well, the woman didn't even know if this Upper World was ruled by humans. From the looks of it, she was only pretending to be ignorant in the well. Zheng wondered how powerful the lord of Blue City was.</p>

  <p>He didn't know where he was headed. He was still rather inclined to becoming an independent warrior— he wasn't even interested in joining the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, let alone following this woman to Blue City.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his service at the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, he planned to take his leave.</p>

  <p>But things developed beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Reading World was one of the remote supreme worlds among those controlled by humans. Three powers ruled over this supreme world— the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, the Tide Sacred Place, and the Spirit Reading Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>In addition, countless sacred places and divine kingdoms of varying sizes were scattered throughout the supreme world.</p>

  <p>Ninth grade, eighth grade, seventh grade, sixth grade… Sacred places and divine kingdoms of all sort of grades were around, with the fifth grade, fourth grade, third grade, and second grade sects being countless.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place and the Tide Sacred Place were the weaker ones among the tenth grade sacred places. Given its name, the Spirit Reading Sacred Place was naturally the core of the entire Spirit Reading World.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how wide the supreme world was, just the area occupied by the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was already too big for Zheng to imagine.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current speed in flight, it would take him at least three years to leave the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Clearly, this was why Dorothea said that the Divine Kingdom Continent was not even as big as her backyard— the scope of a supreme world was far beyond Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>As for Blue City, it was a relatively important area of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. The woman's uncle was someone who had ascended from the Lower World like her and managed to be promoted to the position of a city lord— he could be considered one of the top figures in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Because the woman had taken quite a fancy to Zheng's talent, she figured she could recommend him to her uncle in the future.</p>

  <p>But much to her dismay, Zheng seemed to be arrogant and not interested in her proposal. After making that judgment, she decided not to bring it up again.</p>

  <p>After the woman left the Ascending Well, more and more warriors gradually adapted to the vitality of heaven and earth. After leaving one after another, each entered the pavilion wearing the standard shackles.</p>

  <p>These powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm all had an arrogant nature— how could they have been willing to wear shackles and be put under control? It was inevitable that they would clash with the armored warriors, but the latter showed no kindness whatsoever. Instead, they started with a warning— no matter how great the warriors were in the Lower World, after choosing to ascend, they were back to zero.</p>

  <p>"In the Lower World, you may have been able to hold the life and death of thousands of people in a single sentence. You may have surpassed countless others where you came from. But in the Upper World, you are nobody!" one of the armored warriors roared at the powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The insult triggered two of them, making them exchange blows with the armored warriors. The result of the squabble wasn't hard to guess— the two Soul Sea Realm warriors had to pay the price. They were shackled with special handcuffs, twice the size of the normal ones. These were divine weapons with two massive black balls hanging from them, restricting the warriors seemingly indefinitely.</p>

  <p>No one knew what material the black balls were made of— even the powerful warriors had trouble pulling them along. It seemed that it would be all too difficult to even fly away from the restraints.</p>

  <p>Three days later, all the Soul Sea Realm warriors left the Ascending Wells before staying with Zheng in the pavilion.</p>

  <p>After the armored warriors counted the warriors that arrived, they registered all of their names before escorting them to a transmission array.</p>

  <p>The supreme world was so wide that even the almighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm had to use transmission arrays to travel. Otherwise, it would take a warrior almost a year to travel the distance of over a hundred million miles between the two main cities.</p>
