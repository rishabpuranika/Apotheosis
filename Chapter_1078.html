</p>

  <p>Both the Feather Emperor Secret Land and the Divine Emperor Secret Land were extremely dangerous areas for martial artists.</p>

  <p>However, they were nothing compared to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>In the Feather Emperor Secret Land, as long as one followed the rules of mining and had the expertise, there wouldn't be any major problems.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was a land of corruption.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Dragon Lineage Human, no other living beings were allowed to enter.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms had discussed this predicament together countless times. In the end, they were able to come up with an alternative method? they would use the corpses in the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Corpses of Dragon Lineage Human were preserved within Divine Emperor Secret Land. Many of them had been preserved using secret techniques, allowing them to withstand the ravages of time.</p>

  <p>If they occupied these corpses and entered the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, they would not be rejected by the blood sacrifice inside.</p>

  <p>But even then, the four divine kingdoms were still in the most rudimentary stages of developing the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. Plus it wasn't easy to obtain these corpses from the Divine Emperor Secret Land and even when they did get them, there were many restrictions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng got a general understanding of these secret lands from Randy. The four lands were originally complementary to each other, and the Feather Holy Sea was home to the Dragon Lineage Human. However, there were many limitations to exploring this place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that he definitely couldn't rush into Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. The four divine kingdoms had spent so many years trying to enter it, and things weren't easy for them even after they had gotten in. So obtaining the life stones and the Ancestral Dragon egg didn't seem like an easy task.</p>

  <p>Even without the obstruction of the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm or the experts of the Life and Death Realm, it wouldn't have been easy for Luo Luo Zheng to enter that place anyway.</p>

  <p>The collaboration with Randy seemed to be inevitable.</p>

  <p>"After I obtain the Harlen Token, I will form a team and enter the Feather Holy Sea. Since you want to excavate the life stones, you must also help me," Randy smiled. However, he was afraid that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't stay.</p>

  <p>Even though he was a Lord and was bestowed many rewards every year, he was nothing compared to the crown prince, who was the future emperor. The difference between the two was great.</p>

  <p>It was possible that Luo Zheng's need would motivate him to agree. But Randy didn't have much of a relationship with him. On the contrary, he had had enmity with him before. The only thing that he could use to convince Luo Luo Zheng was his sincerity.</p>

  <p>Randy was an extremely intelligent person. Therefore, when he spoke to Luo Luo Zheng, he did not hide anything. Every word he said was heartfelt.</p>

  <p>Now that he and Luo Luo Zheng had the same goals, he naturally had to go with the flow and pull Luo Luo Zheng into his team.</p>

  <p>In this aspect, he had done well. Luo Luo Zheng had always been very wary of people from the divine kingdoms, but because of Randy's straightforward nature, he was willing to follow him to his mansion.</p>

  <p>"No problem," Luo Luo Zheng smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Great!" Randy clapped his hands and yelled, "Bring some wine!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, fine wine and delicious food were placed in front of them.</p>

  <p>This wine was as thick as blood, and it didn't smell like alcohol at all.</p>

  <p>Instead, it had an extremely pleasing scent.</p>

  <p>Seeing the hesitation on Luo Zheng's face, Randy smiled and said, "This is my Harlen Divine Kingdom's Intoxicating Fragrance. Despite our cultivation, we can get drunk."</p>

  <p>Ordinary wine no longer had any effect on a martial artist's body. It was like water to them; they couldn't get drunk no matter how much alcohol they consumed.</p>

  <p>To dispel Luo Zheng's doubts, Randy poured the blood-like wine into his mouth, turned over the jade cup, and smiled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled back and raised his glass, too, gulping it down in one sip.</p>

  <p>He was curious about the wine. It would be incredibly hard to kill him thanks to his strong immunity.</p>

  <p>After that, they began to talk merrily and drink heartily.</p>

  <p>After a few pots of the Intoxicating Fragrance, the two of them were indeed a little drunk. Suddenly Randy said to the servant girl, "Go get the princess."</p>

  <p>The servant girl hesitated before replying, "Lord Randy, I'm afraid the princess has already gone to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Then wake her up!" Randy roared.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Lord had lost his temper, the servant didn't dare to delay any longer. Nodding her head nervously, she retreated.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was baffled. Why was Randy calling his woman over?</p>

  <p>Seeing the look in Luo Zheng's eyes, Randy laughed mischievously. He grabbed a luminous wine cup with both hands and waved it at Luo Luo Zheng before finishing it in one gulp.</p>

  <p>"There is a saying in our Harlen Divine Kingdom that if you could see Hester dancing, you would be willing to give up at least a hundred years of your life. She is the most beautiful woman in our kingdom. You'll be amazed," said the tipsy Lord.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that inappropriate?" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. He was speechless.</p>

  <p>He really didn't know what was going on with Randy. Why was he suddenly asking his wife to dance for them? No matter what, she was still his concubine. How could he insult her like this?</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong in that." Randy waved his hand. "I'm happy today!"</p>

  <p>But his words made Luo Luo Zheng feel even more uncomfortable. Randy had told him that Hester was the crown prince's snitch. As a Lord, even his wife wasn't on his side. Luo Luo Zheng thought he must be miserable.</p>

  <p>Still, he thought it was wrong to humiliate her like this.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, a young woman walked in angrily with a few servants in tow.</p>

  <p>Randy waved her over and said, "Hester, perform for us. Sing and dance."</p>

  <p>A furious Hester had stomped over! She wouldn't allow her husband to degrade her like this.</p>

  <p>Her face was red with anger. She wouldn't comply. Born into a famous family and being so beautiful, she was well-known in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Despite that, she had been forced to marry Randy because of an arrangement with the crown prince.</p>

  <p>They had been married for more than a year, but they didn't love each other. At the end of the day, she was still the crown prince's woman. So far, her marriage with Randy was just a show. Her entire family's fate was in the crown prince's hands, so she would only listen to him.</p>

  <p>As per the crown prince's orders, she was to report to him about Randy's activities from time to time.</p>

  <p>Randy, too, was aware of this fact. The entire mansion was full of the crown prince's spies, and everything was handled solely by him. To put it bluntly, the crown prince felt that Randy was too much of a threat and he wanted to imprison him.</p>

  <p>Randy was also wary of her and she knew it too. But she couldn't stand such humiliation.</p>

  <p>She was enraged right now.</p>

  <p>She refused to comply and this made the Lord furious. An extremely sharp killing intent was released, which immediately enveloped her.</p>

  <p>"Dance or die!" said Randy, glaring at her.</p>

  <p>Hester's heart trembled under this gaze. If the Lord decided to kill her, no one would be able to plead with him.</p>

  <p>Helpless, she gritted her teeth and agreed.</p>

  <p>As the musicians played the music, this woman danced in front of Luo Luo Zheng and Randy.</p>

  <p>When he saw the reluctance and hatred in her eyes, Luo Luo Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>However, this was a royal family matter, so he couldn't interfere.</p>

  <p>He realized why Randy was humiliating Hester by making her dance in front of a stranger. He hated the people in his mansion, including his wife. They all worked for the crown prince. It was unbearable, so he needed to vent his anger.</p>

  <p>But he also wanted to earn Luo Zheng's trust.</p>

  <p>However, the Lord was too young and immature. He was not even twenty years old. He only wanted to achieve his own goals without thinking about the consequences of his actions. His own wife dancing for his guest would be a disgrace to himself. It was ridiculous!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Lord didn't care about this. On the contrary, it made Luo Luo Zheng extremely uncomfortable? like he was sitting on a bed of nails!</p>
