<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1135 Saving Fiona </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The arrows were fast, sharp and extremely dangerous considering that both stick and head contained the deadly Dragon Arsenic. One hit was all it would take to kill an ordinary martial artist.</p>

  <p>It was lucky that this group of warriors consisted of divine-level talents who knew how to dodge and possessed varied, unique skills to keep themselves alive. Despite having been surrounded by arrows on all sides, only a few perished under the attack.</p>

  <p>However, Fiona had not been so lucky given that she had been forced into a corner with nowhere left to run.</p>

  <p>Fiona was the princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom and her status was even higher than that of any ordinary crown prince. Any warrior would normally be happy to come to her aid since rescuing someone like her meant gaining favor from the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>However, the situation at that moment was dire. No one dared to risk their lives against the onslaught of the Dragon Arsenic arrows. Aside from containing deadly poison, these arrows were not ordinary projectile weapons. Instead of stopping or slowing down once they hit something, the arrows would greatly increase their speed to kill their targets faster.</p>

  <p>"Fiona!" Callan shouted in desperation once he realized Fiona's position.</p>

  <p>The two of them enjoyed a relatively safe spot at the front of the line earlier but now, Fiona had found herself in an extremely dangerous situation with arrows cornering her in all directions.</p>

  <p>Fiona herself felt hopeless. Her eyes darted around, trying to find a way to get through this predicament.</p>

  <p>Thinking fast, her jade bracelet vibrated violently and a mysterious wave of Law Power emanated from her. Maybe she could use the Time Law to stop the arrows!</p>

  <p>But it didn't. These arrows had already been infused with Time Law that was even stronger than Fiona's. Even after using her powers, the arrows still continued their approach without changing a beat in their speed.</p>

  <p>When two warriors used Time Law at the same time, the stronger law would completely overpower the weaker one which was what happened with Fiona. Instead of stopping the arrows, the effect of her Time Law was redirected to the warriors around her instead, slowing down their speed.</p>

  <p>Realizing what had happened, Fiona quickly withdrew the Time Law in panic. She nearly killed the warriors near her when she unintentionally slowed down their movements so it was understandable that some of them had let out a few curses directed at her.</p>

  <p>Fiona was now left with no more options. Time Law did not work so she did not dare use any other martial skills on the arrows. She could only look on in despair as her doom slowly approached in the form of Dragon Arsenic arrows.</p>

  <p>'Am I not strong enough? Father was right. I am still not qualified to travel alone given my current strength. I just didn't think I'd die the first time I explored the secret land, ' she thought to herself sadly.</p>

  <p>Fiona was someone who had never experienced the cruelty of the real world. She had been sheltered and thus grew up with the naive understanding that everything was bright and beautiful. Now, however, she finally realized just how dark and unforgiving life could be for the uninitiated.</p>

  <p>Before she left, her father had offered her a vest. This vest was a divine weapon that had the capability of blocking these sharp arrows that were now on their way to her. However, she rejected his offer thinking that he doted on her too much which inhibited her growth. She now regretted not taking that vest with her.</p>

  <p>The arrows glowed with a faint, blue light that made her think of the gleam of Death's scythe. As the arrows inched towards her, Fiona couldn't help but regret her childishness. She should've listened to her father, but now, it was too late.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng had given up on pushing the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>Without missing a beat, he crossed over space and rushed towards Fiona.</p>

  <p>'What is he doing back here? Does he want to save me?' she wondered to herself. Four arrows from both left and right trapped her in a corner with no way of breaking out. What was Luo Zheng planning to do in turning back for her? There was no way he could save her unless he was willing to perish by blocking the arrows himself with his body.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing! What are you doing? Just go back and push the stone! Are you trying to kill all of us?"</p>

  <p>"You idiot! We're so close! What are you doing?!"</p>

  <p>"If you don't push the magnetic stone, all of us are going to die!"</p>

  <p>For the other warriors, Luo Zheng was the only silver lining that remained in this situation. Following behind Luo Zheng as he pushed the magnetic stone with all his strength meant passing through the area and living for another day.</p>

  <p>They were only several hundred feet away from safety but Luo Zheng suddenly stopped pushing and actually left the magnetic stone behind. Was he going to see everyone die?</p>

  <p>Although the other warriors were driven into panic and despair upon his departure, Randy, Camilla, and Renzo remained silent. They were also anxious and had no idea why Luo Zheng turned back but they knew they could trust him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. These people were truly demanding. In truth, Luo Zheng did not care about the lives of others but Fiona had left a good impression on him. She was kind and was even willing to lend her the semi-divine bracelet she had during his battle with War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>He felt grateful to her in some way and he couldn't just leave her behind to die.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Luo Zheng that Fiona had done it out of kindness and nothing more. She was a nice girl and he had to save her.</p>

  <p>By the time he arrived at her side, the four arrows were already only a few inches away from her.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you doing?!" she screeched when she saw Luo Zheng reach out his hands towards the arrows. These arrows contained Dragon Arsenic and had instantly killed so many divine-level talents just a few moments ago. What was he thinking just grabbing them like that in midair?</p>

  <p>Everyone also thought of the same thing upon seeing Zheng's actions. They knew he wanted to save Fiona but they didn't think he'd do it by grabbing the poisoned arrows with his bare hands!</p>

  <p>Was he courting death?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed the tips of the two sharp arrows on the right as if they were mere apples from a bright, sunny orchard and not extremely poisonous projectile weapons designed to kill instantly.</p>

  <p>However, there was a reason for his actions. Due to the influence of the Time Law, any casual contact on the arrows would cause them to increase their speed which effectively raised the possibility of piercing through Fiona's body.</p>

  <p>The moment he held the tips, a tremendous force immediately burst forth from the arrows.</p>

  <p>The force was enough to push him forward but, by holding onto the tips, Luo Zheng was able to take advantage of the momentum. Instead of being hit by the arrows, Fiona's body came into contact with the back of Zheng's hand which was enough to push her out of danger's way.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the two sharp arrows pierced through Zheng's hands but immediately flew away and vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>Zheng's hands were comparable to a sacred weapon but the arrows were so strong that they were able to pierce through them. One could imagine how formidable the power contained within these arrows in the Slow Arrow Area...</p>

  <p>Fiona could only stare at Luo Zheng in a daze. Yes, she was now safe but her savior was now doomed!</p>

  <p>Blood flowed heavily from Zheng's hands while the blue Dragon Arsenic spread rapidly through his bloodstream. In a matter of seconds, the poison had made its way from his wrists to the other parts of his body.</p>

  <p>"Stop daydreaming! That guy's now dead for sure! We have to push the stone ourselves!"</p>

  <p>"Tianxing can't help us now! Let's all push the stone quickly! Everyone, be careful! Don't touch him or you'll be poisoned too!"</p>

  <p>The other warriors knew they couldn't rely on Zheng's monstrous strength now, not when he was doomed to die by the poison. They now had to push the magnetic stone themselves, otherwise, they would all die.</p>

  <p>Five to six figures rushed forward and began to violently bombard the magnetic stone with their combined strength.</p>

  <p>The combined efforts of these several divine-level talents had some effect but their strength could only move the magnetic stone a foot at most - significantly less than the distance Luo Zheng had managed by pushing it on his own.</p>

  <p>While the others were busy trying to push the stone, Callan, Fiona, Randy, and Camilla remained with their gazes fixed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'The poison has spread throughout his body but� why is his body not corroding?' Both Fiona and Callan asked the same question inside their heads at the same time.</p>
