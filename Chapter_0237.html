<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 237 Face To The Fight (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>When the Desperate Melee had been triggered, everyone was connected by a thin stream of life vitality. Since there were many people at the beginning, this life vitality had been quite disorganized.</p>

  <p>However, as the battle continued, more and more Illuminating Soul Realm masters were killed. The life vitality stream connecting a person to the other participants would break after his death.</p>

  <p>Now, only three connected streams of life vitality were left.</p>

  <p>They linked Zheng with the other two Illuminating Soul Realm masters, Seymour and an old man with a dragon head stick in his hand.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched, Seymour fought the old man fiercely.</p>

  <p>Since they had managed to survive to the end, both Seymour and the old man must be outstanding in terms of wisdom and competence.</p>

  <p>Both opponents knew that only one of them could survive to the end and that the survivor would become the owner of the fairy palace treasure house.</p>

  <p>The young man in the mask who had been watching them fight had only reached a half-step into the nature level, so they were not afraid of him at all.</p>

  <p>Now, since they were just one step away from success, the fighting between these two Illuminating Soul Realm masters increased in intensity. The raging life vitality burnt crazily and its impact could be felt across all corners of the pavilion. Even Zheng, who was watching from a distance, could feel it. To protect himself, Zheng stood behind the black hawk.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Hearing several loud explosions, Zheng walked out from behind the black hawk. As the burning life vitality faded, he saw Seymour standing with the jade sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>He looked utterly bedraggled with torn clothes and burnt hair. Seymour cursed as he limped, "Fuck! Did you think I would die with you, old bastard? Dream on!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Seymour realized that a stream of life vitality still bounded his chest. He had spent all his energy in fighting the old man and had forgotten that there was still a rival in the pavilion.</p>

  <p>It came to Seymour that he needed to fight the young man in the mask.</p>

  <p>However, the thought didn't worry Seymour. A relaxed expression replaced the confusion Seymour felt when he saw the life vitality around his chest. To him, a young man who had just reached a half-step into the nature level was nothing more than a little beetle. Although he was badly injured, Seymour was confident that he would be able to crush the little beetle.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you have two choices. Either you commit suicide, or you die by my hand. You'd better choose suicide so that you do not waste my time. Otherwise, as punishment, you'll suffer a lot before you die!" With that, Seymour gradually walked closer to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng narrowed his eyes and replied, "What if I don't choose any of them?"</p>

  <p>Seymour shook his head and shouted, "You don't have a third choice!"</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Zheng suddenly burst into laughter. "Who do you think you are? Why should you decide my future? I have a third option. I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng reached out, and the power of the Phoenix Crystal in his right hand was injected into the body of the black hawk beside him.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the power, the speed of the black hawk increased tenfold. Then it flew toward Seymour.</p>

  <p>Seymour had already noticed the black hawk standing besides Zheng. Not only had it increased in size after swallowing countless life vitality, but its power was also astonishing. Thinking about this, fear coursed through Seymour. However, he reminded himself that the person controlling the black hawk was only a young man at a half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>With the control ability of a person at a half-step into the nature level, the black hawk would have no threat to him at all.</p>

  <p>Since practitioners who were at a half-step into the nature level, had not learned how to transform the life energy in their body into life vitality yet, they were unable to skillfully control a life vitality avatar. Therefore, even if the black hawk were significantly powerful, it couldn't match Seymour, who could move as quickly as a ghost.</p>

  <p>However, to Seymour's surprise, when the black hawk was infused with demonic life energy combined with the power of the Phoenix Crystal, its speed had increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>With a whir, the black hawk turned into a strong wind and gushed toward Seymour.</p>

  <p>Although Seymour had been injured badly when he was fighting the old man, as an Illuminating Soul Realm master, his speed and strain capacity were much better than an average person's. Even though he was limping, Seymour still managed to dodge the black hawk's attack.</p>

  <p>"Your black hawk is truly remarkable. It has accumulated such tremendous power so quickly! Even I can't compare with it. However, although very fast, its speed is still not enough. You want to rely on this black hawk to defeat me? Dream on!" Seymour's eyes glittered as he shouted at Zheng. Then, he threw himself into the air at an extremely high speed and swung his jade sword at Zheng.</p>

  <p>If an Illuminating Soul Realm master tried, he could reach incredibly high speeds. With a blink of an eye, Seymour, who had been some distance away from Zheng, narrowed the gap between them to such an extent that he was now less than three feet away!</p>

  <p>"Wow, so fast!" Zheng shouted in shock. He immediately activated the Phoenix Crystal in his right arm. Then his speed suddenly increased tenfold. When supplemented by the momentary burst of power from his legs, Zheng was able to push himself more than a hundred feet away. Thus, he narrowly dodged Seymour's sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng was at a half-step into the nature level, so he could neither burn his life vitality nor fly. Whereas, Seymour could do both of these. Seeing that his target had run away, Seymour gave chase.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was unable to fly like Seymour, he was inevitably at a disadvantage.</p>
