<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face when he heard the voice of the Ear Mouse hawking its soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Normally, a finger-size chunk of soul crystal could be bought with one million soul pills. Now, however, these Ear Mice asked for three million.</p>

  <p>Their greed was really insatiable.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Souls of Light crowding around the gate of the Soul City were in a hurry to pass the trial. If they really fell just a little short of the required level, they would most likely choose to pay three million soul pills.</p>

  <p>Besides, the strong warriors who had reached this level must have a high status in their respective races, so they could afford so many soul pills.</p>

  <p>After a while, the gate of the Soul City slowly opened.</p>

  <p>The moment the gate opened, numerous faces of the Souls of Light appeared on the gate and let out incessant wails.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a vast amount of soul auras flooded out of the city.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen the auras of the Souls of Light of Eternal Realm masters, such as Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm. However, even the auras of Eternal Warriors could not be compared to those in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Soul City was formed by trillions of souls after all.</p>

  <p>"The gate is open!"</p>

  <p>"I hope I can go further this time!"</p>

  <p>"Every time I came, I always failed to move forward. I've been stuck in that step for years."</p>

  <p>As soon as the gate was opened, it was immediately jammed with countless people trying to enter the city.</p>

  <p>"Let's go in," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>He and Elvinia immediately followed the other Souls of Light into the Soul City.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng set foot in the Soul City, he was immediately wrapped in the ubiquitous soul auras. Generally speaking, the soul aura could be seen as leaked consciousness, and consciousness itself could be said as one's deepest thought or desire. For example, when someone's desire to kill was strong, their soul aura would become extremely sharp, just like a sharpened knife.</p>

  <p>A weak soul exposed to a murderous aura would feel very uncomfortable. If it was too weak, it would even be annihilated directly.</p>

  <p>If it was a gentle aura, it could comfort the other party and even had the effect of repairing the soul.</p>

  <p>There were countless souls in the Soul City, and each had their own consciousness, so the soul auras contained within were incomparably complicated. They had a very cumbersome impact on Zheng.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be able to listen to the thoughts of millions of people at the same time. Some of them were crying; some were drowned in sadness; some were feeling like outcasts; some were angry; some were bubbling with excitement; some others were filled with happiness.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was also experiencing the same thing as Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was different from real hearing. Listening to these souls could not be gotten rid of, and they had to bear with it as long as they were in the Soul City. In fact, the test had already begun when they stepped into the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng and Elvinia had already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, so their souls were strong and very stable.</p>

  <p>Not far from them, a Soul of Light casually walked into the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Before long, however, he staggered. The pressure of the complex soul auras gradually increased as he went farther into the city, and he couldn't endure it. He tried to cover his ears to escape from the auras but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Once the auras became too overbearing to bear, he finally let out a scream and used all his strength to rush out of the Soul City. He managed to step out of the Soul City right as his soul power was exhausted, but he soon fell on the ground, dying.</p>

  <p>Many people in the city noticed this scene, and most of them had pity in their gazes.</p>

  <p>"That guy is so bold."</p>

  <p>"How dare he come to the Soul City before reaching the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul? It's courting death!"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, he still had the brain to escape when he couldn't hold on any longer. Otherwise, he would've become a part of the Soul City!"</p>

  <p>After they walked in the Soul City for some time, some pillars appeared in front of them. The pillars were only half a person tall, and they could climb up by leaping. One after another, those who walked in the front started to leap onto the pillars and then sat cross-legged.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was sizing the pillars up, Elvinia said, "These are the soul pillars.</p>

  <p>Let's go up too."</p>

  <p>"Soul pillars?" Zheng repeated curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the test in the Soul City is completed on top of these soul pillars. As long as you pass this test, you will have a Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm," said Elvinia.</p>

  <p>She got this information after rummaging through a number of books. As for what exactly they would experience on the soul pillars, she actually didn't really know.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. After finding an unoccupied soul pillar, he gently jumped up and then sat down on top of it with his legs crossed. Elvinia found a soul pillar beside Zheng's and did the same.</p>

  <p>After everyone sat down, numbers appeared on the soul pillars. Both Elvinia's and Zheng's soul pillars showed "one", while that of the Soul of Light on Zheng's right side showed "sixty-three". A number above 1, 300 even appeared on an occupied soul pillar quite a distance away.</p>

  <p>While Zheng looked around, Elvinia said, "These numbers should represent how many times we've entered the Soul City. It's our first time, so our soul pillars show 'one'."</p>

  <p>"The number on that pillar is more than 1, 300, so the Soul of Light sitting on it has entered the Soul City for more than 1, 000 times?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Elvinia answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>After Zheng sat on the soul pillar, it gave no response. Nevertheless, more and more Souls of Light entered the Soul City, and some humans also entered in groups.</p>

  <p>A group of about six or seven people walked towards Elvinia upon entering the area of the soul pillars.</p>

  <p>"Princess Elvinia!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>Just like the creatures on the Other Shore, Elvinia had a physical body in the Soul City, so her presence was very conspicuous. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace naturally noticed her at a glance.</p>

  <p>Elvinia looked at the Soul of Light and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Gabriel," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"I'm Carver," another man introduced himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm Libby," a woman said.</p>

  <p>These people were all disciples from the third floor. They were quite famous in the Oneness Sky Palace. Elvinia had naturally seen them before, but she wasn't too familiar with them. Now that they introduced themselves like this, she naturally knew who they were.</p>

  <p>Elvinia smiled and said, "What a coincidence. I guess I'll make a breakthrough to the Holy Soul Realm along with you guys."</p>

  <p>Entering the Soul City and reaching the Holy Soul Realm was never an easy task.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely painful test for souls. Some people gave up after trying several times, unwilling to take this test again for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>Those who could come to the Soul City for hundreds or thousands of times were the persistent ones.</p>

  <p>It was the first time Elvinia had entered the Soul City. In the eyes of others, she was a mere newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Princess Elvinia, work hard," Gabriel encouraged.</p>

  <p>Upon introducing herself, Libby looked at the soul pillar next to Elvinia's and asked, "Princess Elvinia, may I know who this man is?"</p>

  <p>In fact, she already knew the answer. After the battle in the Oneness Sky Palace, she knew that Elvinia had a close relationship with Zheng. The man who came to Stage Twenty-nine with Elvinia must be that powerful Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is Zheng," Elvinia replied curtly.</p>

  <p>While Zheng didn't return to the Land of Sword Grief after the battle with the Sun Crow race, the story of his deeds had undoubtedly spread to that place, turning him into a household name.</p>

  <p>Before Goran went to the Dragon Cliff, he said in the Land of Sword Grief,</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't because our Oneness Sky Palace had Zheng, the human race in the Bloom Divine Province would've been exterminated."</p>

  <p>The significance of Zheng's presence was self-evident.</p>
