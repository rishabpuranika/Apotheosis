<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a reason why the word "pariah" came into being.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was situated within the Bloom Divine Province. It had countless branches that further comprised of many clans.</p>

  <p>Every year, over a hundred million humans flocked into the vicinity of the Bloom Divine Province. They would hope to join the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The column of the people was so long that it appeared to be an endless pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>They had set several trials for the warriors to limit their entry into the palace. Sword Wall was one of the many tests they had to pass to get in.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng and his group had come from the Origin Mountain, they didn't meet the other barriers before the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>The aboriginals of Bloom Divine Province looked down upon the outsiders and called them pariahs.</p>

  <p>When the others saw how Zheng was being treated by the young men, they became nervous. They were worried about Zheng and themselves since they all arrived together. Even Beldene and Elgin were tensed since they were all new to the place.</p>

  <p>With a sharp glare, Jagger stared at Zheng and scoffed, "You dare to provoke me?"</p>

  <p>In response, Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly and shrugged. "I never provoke losers."</p>

  <p>"It seems that in your eyes, I am not a loser," Jagger sneered at him meaningfully.</p>

  <p>Zheng cast a sideways glance at Jagger and said, "You're right. In my eyes, you are even worse than a loser."</p>

  <p>The young man from Jagger's group broke out in explosive laughter and said, "Jagger, if you can't win him in words, just kill him. Do you still want to keep such a pariah alive?"</p>

  <p>The killing intent in Jagger's eyes grew stronger. His eyes were fuming with rage as he glared at Zheng. "As I said, anyone making trouble under the Sword Wall shall be killed, regardless of occasions. I will give you one last chance. Kneel here and bow to me and my brother one hundred times, and disable your elixir field. Then maybe, I'll spare your life. Otherwise, I will be forced to follow the rules and take your life!"</p>

  <p>The spectators in the crowd began whispering to each other. "That guy is digging his own grave..."</p>

  <p>"I'd disable my elixir field if I were him. How ignorant he is to fight against the people of the Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>"A warrior who has lost their cultivation base is as good as dead. If he leaves here, he will probably be killed!"</p>

  <p>"This is how one will end up when they offend the Wang Clan!"</p>

  <p>They looked at Zheng with sympathetic eyes.</p>

  <p>As things got more intense, Zheng did not appear to let up. Beldene knew the situation was going to spiral out of their control if he didn't act upon it.</p>

  <p>He mustered up the courage and walked towards Jagger and said, "This is just a misunderstanding. Let's come to a compromise. We can pay for it..."</p>

  <p>"Who asked for your opinion? Get lost!" yelled Jagger, his nerves exploding.</p>

  <p>He had crossed the eighth line in the Sea of Truth. When Jagger roared in frustration, his sharp aura surged through his body like sharp swords that came straight to Beldene. Beldene's face turned pale as he took a few steps back from the impact. He struggled to remain on his feet and almost collapsed to the ground.</p>

  <p>That was the last straw. Zheng could not hold himself anymore. He balled his hands into fists and tightened his jaw. His face turned cold as he sneered at Jagger, "Is this how you always reason with people? By yelling? And you had the nerve to talk about rules? Are all people from the Oneness Sky Palace assholes like you?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that you are not going to compromise," Jagger scoffed as he slowly pulled out a long sword from behind. "Of course Oneness Sky Palace is a reasonable place, but there is only one piece of reason we care about. A good-for-nothing pariah like you should die!"</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent spreading in the cold air turned into tiny swords of ice, each of them compressed and fused into his long sword.</p>

  <p>Dreadfully strong aura gushed out from the sword, but Zheng's expression didn't change. He stood there watching indifferently.</p>

  <p>Closely studying Jagger's aura that emitted from his body, Zheng theorized his strength was close to Nicholas'. Maybe a little weaker than Nicholas, but not by much.</p>

  <p>While the swords continued to compress and merge, Jagger took the moment and charged straight at Zheng without giving him time to react. It was the perfect chance.</p>

  <p>He rushed forward pointing his sword at the middle of Zheng's eyebrows, determined to take Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>"Truth of Cultivation Nature!"</p>

  <p>Jagger was not an Other Shore Realm warrior. Therefore, Zheng didn't feel the need to use the Soaring Snake Sword or the Imperial Sword Seal to deal with him.</p>

  <p>However, being a member of the Bloom Divine Province, Jagger had cultivated some formidable theurgies of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>And that was what Zheng lacked in his cultivation, putting him at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly took a step back to retreat from an offensive and impulsive Jagger. They both flew up in the air to not disrupt the crowd during their battle.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they had made a circuit around the vast area from their fight.</p>

  <p>The people below them dodged and retreated in confusion to not be hurt from the impact.</p>

  <p>"You will die no matter where you run to!"</p>

  <p>A look of disdain reflected in Jagger's eyes when he saw Zheng keep retreating further back. Then, he swung his sword lightly.</p>

  <p>The tiny frosty swords that fused into Jagger's sword came darting out in all directions. After spinning for a while in the air, they began to surround Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had nowhere left to retreat.</p>

  <p>Watching the swords come at him, Zheng didn't move a muscle. He showed no signs of panic. Suddenly with a flash of light in his eyes, Ways-blending Energy emitted from his body.</p>

  <p>Instead of flinching, he charged at Jagger.</p>

  <p>Jagger scorned, "Oh, so now you want to fight me? Let me help you die!</p>

  <p>Sword Destruction Move!"</p>

  <p>In the face of Zheng's sudden advancing, Jagger swiftly waved his long sword.</p>

  <p>The many tiny frosty swords surrounding Zheng exploded into tens of thousands of sharp fragments. The extremely cold aura mixed with the fragments enveloped Zheng completely.</p>

  <p>The Sword Destruction Move was a unique skill of the Wang Clan. Once it was activated, the target was a sure kill. There was never any exception.</p>

  <p>And the area within the perimeters of the attack would turn to ruins.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and the others were lost for words when they saw Zheng submerged in the white cold aura. They froze in place, as they watched in horror, wondering if he was dead.</p>

  <p>A hint of sadness could be seen in Elgin's eyes. He shut them forcefully and lowered his gaze to the ground in sorrow with his fists clenched tight. Even though he was jealous of Zheng and his talent, he showed loyalty to them on the Origin Mountain. Zheng was qualified enough to stay there, and yet he decided to come with his fellow disciples who weren't even that close to him.</p>

  <p>"Is that guy dead?" a disciple in a white robe whispered to break the silence.</p>

  <p>"I've always heard the Sword Destruction Move is a unique skill of the Wang Clan. Now I see it's really powerful," another white-robed disciple exclaimed.</p>

  <p>A malicious smile spread across Carlisle's face as he imagined Zheng being chopped up into pieces within that frosty aura.</p>

  <p>The temperature in the white fog dropped even lower than before. Zheng sensed the killing intent that enveloped him.</p>

  <p>Not only was his pace slowed down but the sharp pieces in the cold aura kept piercing through his body. Even the Truth of Cultivation Nature was unable to assist him in dodging the pieces.</p>

  <p>If it had been anyone else, they would have been split into pieces by now from the continuous fierce attacks in the icy mist.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was not an ordinary warrior. His body began to emit a faint golden light and a mysteriously powerful aura emerged. The aura darted at the frosty swords and turned them to powder!</p>

  <p>The next moment, Zheng emerged from the white fog in one piece.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng break out from the mist unscathed made Jagger freeze in confusion.</p>

  <p>He could sense Zheng's presence in the mist when he trapped him. But he wondered why his body remained intact despite all the swords cutting through him. When he saw Zheng rush out of the mist with no trace of blood anywhere, he was stunned. He desperately scanned his frame for any injury, but he was unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Jagger was unable to hide his frustration in his eyes when he saw the glow of Ways-blending Energy on Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>With his experience, he could not recognize the Ways-blending Energy. But the fierce aura emanating from Zheng's sword reminded Jagger not to underestimate it.</p>

  <p>"Now, let's see who will die first!" Zheng said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>He covered the short distance between him and Jagger in a flash, swinging his sword at Jagger with lightning-fast speed.</p>
