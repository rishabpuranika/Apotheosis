  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng completely forgot about himself with this slash.</p>

  <p>To him, everything in the world was moving away from him. Nothing seemed constant. He felt some sort of distance with everything around.</p>

  <p>Only the sword intent remained.</p>

  <p>It was a cruel strike that even he had forgotten about himself.</p>

  <p>As his sword flashed out, a light appeared out of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>If he were to face the enemy head on, he would be easily defeated because of the obvious reason that he couldn't even move a limb in this motionless state.</p>

  <p>Such was the essence of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. The Ripping Consciousness was a deciding factor of life and death.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword that Luo Luo Zheng thrust towards the sky did not have much impact.</p>

  <p>But the two-inch-wide sword light shot straight into the sky, advancing at an extremely fast speed into the depths of the universe.</p>

  <p>Soon, the small white sword light pierced through the first star, leaving a gaping two-inch-wide hole in between.</p>

  <p>For a star that was tens of thousands of miles in diameter, a two-inch-wide hole hardly made a dent. The star did not even tremble, as if it did not feel anything.</p>

  <p>However, not long after the sword light left the star, it slowly began to sway. The slight sway created countless ripples across its surface.</p>

  <p>There were quite a few Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists cultivating on this star. They were all confused about the sudden movement of the star. Quickly they transformed themselves into light beams and vanished.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As soon as they vanished, the star shuddered and slowly began to collapse.</p>

  <p>But the stream of light didn't stop after piercing through the star and continued to move up. However, no one in the universe noticed its existence and the flurry of activities it created. After all, this tiny bit of sword light was insignificant compared to the humongous universe.</p>

  <p>However, the amount of power that was packed into this little light was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>The light kept piercing through various stars. Despite its increasing ascend, its power and brightness did not dim at all. Finally it pierced through the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword had left a huge gap that was 1, 000 feet deep on the Sighing Wall. However, Luo Zheng's sword was much sharper and more penetrating. It went as deep as 30, 000 feet into the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>When the ray of sword light finally disappeared, Luo Zheng's consciousness gradually returned. Although he was still recovering from the haze, he could slowly move himself around.</p>

  <p>His eyes became sharp and shone with intelligence. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly, and a look of satisfaction appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>After comprehending the Ripping Consciousness, he had a deeper understanding of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the mountain wall that was looming ahead of him collapsed.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, the giant structure was reduced to a heap.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hardly lifted a finger to do this feat. The golden light that emitted from his eyes was enough to slice the mountain into pieces.</p>

  <p>Now, if Luo Luo Zheng activated those small golden swords, he could really kill with his eyes.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, Luo Luo Zheng could hear a strange buzzing sound, as soon as the mountain collapsed. As he was trying to locate the source of the sound, his eyes caught some movement behind the heap. A Lotus Flower slowly rose from behind the collapsed mountain wall.</p>

  <p>"The Lotus Flower?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned seeing the revered flower.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flowers of the nine Godly Geniuses had all bloomed fully, except Luo Zheng's. Luo Luo Zheng could not figure out the reason behind it.</p>

  <p>The truth was, once their Lotus Flowers bloomed, they became complete Godly Geniuses. Only then would they have the ability to cross the heavens. And more importantly, they would not be destroyed upon entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>The secondary creatures in the universe all ascended to the divine land after they became True Gods, just like Tianming.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't sure how long it would take him to condense the Godly Tile, but before that, he needed to become a genuine Godly Genius. And to achieve this, he had to attain a certain level of understanding of the Divine Dao and break free from the shackles of the heavens.</p>

  <p>As the Lotus Flower started slowly rotating, Luo Luo Zheng stared fixedly at it as if hypnotized.</p>

  <p>When the martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, and Spirit Transformation Realm underwent tribulations, these Lotus Flowers had also appeared. But just with their appearance, there was no guarantee that they would bloom. On many occasions, the Lotus Flowers would only rotate a few times before quietly vanishing into thin air.</p>

  <p>Hence there was always an air of speculation, pertaining to the appearance of the flowers.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Luo Zheng was a bit nervous. He was afraid that his understanding of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao wasn't deep enough and that the Lotus Flower wouldn't bloom. After all, even he was unaware of the blooming strategy of the flower.</p>

  <p>He had already comprehended the Great Wishing Spell. In theory, he had become a genuine Godly Genius. However, the Great Wishing Spell wasn't acknowledged by the Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was paying attention to the Lotus Flower, Master Feng and Wynn also fixed their eyes on it. They were equally apprehensive regarding its bloom.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng had processed a new understanding of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. But the moment the Lotus Flower appeared, Master Feng could sense it immediately.</p>

  <p>As the controller of the Heavens-suppressing Object, Master Feng had a clear understanding of every Lotus Flower in full bloom in the entire Evolutionary Universe. Moreover, there were only a few hundred people in the entire universe who possessed the Mahayana Lotus Flowers, and only Luo Zheng's Lotus Flower had thirty-five leaves.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the moment Master Feng sensed it, he informed Wynn.</p>

  <p>"This time, Luo Luo Zheng should be successful," Wynn said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Even after his Lotus Flower has fully bloomed, he still needs some time to condense his Godly Tile. I wonder how much more time will be needed," Master Feng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>It was true that the crisis of the Evolutionary Universe had come to an end, but Murphy would not let this matter rest. Time was never enough for Luo Luo Zheng. It seemed like he was always running after it.</p>

  <p>"No." Wynn shook his head dismissively. "I won't give him more time to condense his Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>Hearing Wynn's words, Master Feng was slightly stunned. "You mean, you will send Luo Luo Zheng, who is only a world lord, into the divine land? That would be too dangerous for him!"</p>

  <p>Wynn silently nodded his head firmly, as if he had already made his decision.</p>

  <p>"But the competition in the divine land is very fierce. Although Luo Zheng's talent is incomparable, it is a huge risk to undertake," Master Feng protested.</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled slightly. "It's not my idea, but my master's. I can't do much about it anyway. We all know that Luo Luo Zheng is a man out of the ordinary. For all you know, he may not be able to condense the Godly Tile." Saying this, his eyes flickered. "But the truth is, he doesn't even need the Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>The Godly Tile corresponded to the perfection of the life vitality cultivation system. Through the Divine Dao Tablets in the divine land, one would comprehend the supreme law of the divine land - the Divine Dao. Then, the Godly Tile would cover the inner world, absorbing the force of the inner world to unleash the strongest power.</p>

  <p>All of these factors cleverly combined to complement each other. And they had been working splendidly until now.</p>

  <p>However, what Luo Luo Zheng was cultivating right now was not the life vitality system, but the more powerful chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>In Wynn's eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was just a secondary creature. However, no one could identify Luo Zheng's level. According to Wynn's understanding, even if Luo Luo Zheng did not comprehend the Divine Dao, it was unlikely that he would be disintegrated within the divine land. Luo Luo Zheng was too special and powerful to be destroyed just like that!</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Master Feng was extremely surprised. Through his experience, he knew and understood a lot of people. Although he felt that Luo Luo Zheng was definitely different, he didn't expect that Wynn would give such a bizarre evaluation.</p>

  <p>"Look! There's movement!" Master Feng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower floating above Luo Zheng's head suddenly began to spin at a furious speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on that Lotus Flower. His gaze was becoming intensely bright, as if there were two flames burning fiercely at the same time.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Evolution Lotus Flower that was originally controlled by Master Feng had escaped from his control. It suddenly condensed and flew towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Master Feng wanted to chant an incantation to bring the Evolution Lotus Flower back, but he was stopped by Wynn. "Don't interfere. This is my master's arrangement. Let us not disrupt it."</p>

  <p>Huff!</p>

  <p>It was astonishing to witness the speed of that Evolution Lotus Flower. It only took a matter of seconds for it to fly millions of miles away. Soon, it arrived above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"A second Lotus Flower? How is that even possible?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was dumbfounded when he saw the Evolution Lotus Flower fly over. "This flower is the one controlled by Master Feng! How did it escape then?"</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower that Master Feng controlled, was slightly different from the Lotus Flowers that floated above the heads of ordinary warriors. For example, the Lotus Flower above Luo Zheng's head was pinkish white, while the Evolution Lotus Flower of Master Feng was deep red.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, there were many other details that separated it from the rest. For example, the Evolution Lotus Flower of Master Feng had always been a bud and never produced petals.</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower suddenly leapt above Luo Zheng's head and overlapped with the Lotus Flower that Luo Luo Zheng had previously possessed, eventually replacing it and forming into one Lotus Flower.</p>
