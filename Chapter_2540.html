  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had nothing to hide from Zelda.</p>

  <p>As he reached out his hand, a jade token appeared in it.</p>

  <p>"I got an Admission Token from the auction," Luo Zheng said quietly.</p>

  <p>"An Admission Token? How is that possible?" A light flashed in Zelda's eyes.</p>

  <p>Only the powerful forces had the authority to give out the Admission Tokens. It was not a task to be taken lightly, and thus it was entrusted only to those at the very top. These forces could obtain the fertile parts of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>In addition, just one Admission Token could bring the owner a very large profit, so the price was terribly high. One could often be sold for the price of hundreds of thousands of wild bones.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's blood wild bone turned out to be quite valuable, it was not even near valuable enough to be able to exchange it for an Admission Token.</p>

  <p>However, Zelda only remained surprised for a moment. Staring at the Admission Token, she asked, "What are you going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to the part of Immemorial Wilderness beneath the Sky South Bone Tower," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"That place!" Zelda's frown deepened. "Do you not know the current situation in that part of the Immemorial Wilderness?" she asked, her voice apprehensive.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded. "I have been told about it."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you going there?" Zelda exclaimed, puzzled. "If a person like you enters that place, you will be killed immediately, either by the Nine Li race or by the Yellow Emperor race!" she continued.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face remained serene.</p>

  <p>As soon as that place was brought up, silence shrouded the auction house like an oppressive mist. Obviously, everyone wanted to avoid it. The risk was too great.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had left the divine land, he knew nothing about the situation there, even though he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>In the face of such an opportunity, he was willing to take the risk.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, there was Chiyou's blood in that part of the Immemorial Wilderness, and he wanted to find out more about their background.</p>

  <p>"I must go," Luo Zheng replied firmly.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's expression, Zelda knew she couldn't persuade him otherwise. She knew that a man like Luo Zheng wouldn't change his mind once he had set his heart on something.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave five hundred wild bones to Zelda, and then he began to refine the rest of them, working quickly, absorbing the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand pieces of wild bones was a lot. Although the efficiency of Zelda's Trickle Spring Method was not bad, Luo Zheng could only absorb seven or eight hundred pieces of wild bones a day.</p>

  <p>Over the course of half a month, Luo Zheng continued to tirelessly imbibe the Wild God Power, day and night.</p>

  <p>After so many wild bones' power was absorbed, Luo Zheng's aura had gotten noticeably more powerful.</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng concentrated on extracting the Wild God Power in the distance, Zelda felt melancholy. The fewer bones remained, the closer Luo Zheng was to leave. The thought of this filled her with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Zelda, you look unhappy these days," Luther said, without making eye contact.</p>

  <p>Zelda sighed and closed her eyes. "I think Luo Zheng is just someone that the fate sent to help us. He is just someone we can trust..." she said pensively.</p>

  <p>"And yet...you are unsure?" Luther asked with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zelda nodded, her face grim. "He gave us wild bones, taught you cultivation techniques and saved our lives. He has done enough. He is a trustworthy man, but when it comes to the rise and fall of our clan, I really dare not to..."</p>

  <p>Luther stared at Zelda, who was obviously struggling in her mind. His eyes, usually naive, seemed suddenly deep and wise. "Zelda, what do we have to lose besides our own lives?"</p>

  <p>"Although you try so hard to practice, how much have you really improved over the years?" Luther continued, "If just five hundred pieces of wild bones is a large sum to you, what would you say if I remind you that it's not uncommon to find fifty thousand or five hundred thousand pieces of wild bones in the bone tower..."</p>

  <p>Zelda had dreamt that one day she and Luther could rely on themselves and be able to return to the bone tower with dignity.</p>

  <p>That was why she had been working very hard on collecting wild bones and practicing.</p>

  <p>As Luther couldn't cultivate to become a Wild God, she had asked Luo Zheng to teach him the cultivation techniques for True Gods.</p>

  <p>But Luther had come to realize that no matter how talented he and Zelda were, they could never reach their goals without the advantage of the wild bones.</p>

  <p>"So, don't hesitate, Zelda. That's our last resort, our last chance! Now the opportunity has presented itself, you should grab it!" Luther declared, a determined look on his face.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luther speaking with such authority, Zelda was surprised. She looked at him with a pleasant smile and said, "Luther, you've grown up..."</p>

  <p>Zelda had made up her mind. Now, she waited for an opportunity to speak out about it.</p>

  <p>On the twentieth day, Luo Zheng had finally refined and absorbed the power of ten thousand pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>There were still three thousand wild bones in his hand, and he wasn't in a hurry to completely refine them. After all, it was a long way to the Sky South Bone Tower. These wild bones could be used for cultivation, and could also be used as currency. He had to keep some just in case.</p>

  <p>He had been using his mind to extract the Wild God Power for over twenty days and nights. Even though his soul was strong, he felt tired.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he still couldn't wait to go out of the Iron Tribe to test the result of his work.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power had been completely integrated into his own body, and this kind of power was more intuitive than the strength source.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath and muttered, "Get bigger!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A pale yellow light began to radiate from the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body began to grow, faster and faster.</p>

  <p>He was thirty feet tall...</p>

  <p>A moment later, he was a hundred feet tall... and later still, two hundred feet tall...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked down. The houses of the tribe were as big as his fist.</p>

  <p>And his body continued to grow.</p>

  <p>Now he was three hundred feet tall... four hundred feet tall... five hundred... six hundred!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had turned into a tall giant, and the houses of the Iron Tribe did not even come to the top of his ankles.</p>

  <p>As for Zelda and Luther, they seemed as small as ants!</p>

  <p>"The power..."</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power stirred in his body and he had a sudden urge to eject it.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a huge step forward.</p>

  <p>With each step, a crater formed in the ground.</p>

  <p>After taking just about dozens of steps forward, Luo Zheng had walked far away from the tribe and reached the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>"The power..." he continued to muse, mesmerized.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng abruptly raised his hands, bent down and hit the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>An immense force exited in his body, forming a faint wave in the air, which spread out, like ripples on a lake.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>With this wave, the ground within a dozen mile radius of him began to shake violently. He had triggered a small earthquake just with a clap of his hands!</p>

  <p>"Now I know the Wild God Power can't be compared with my strength source. But it's rising fast. I'm only six hundred feet high. How powerful will it be if I become a giant a thousand miles high?"</p>

  <p>After a period of learning to control his newfound powers, Luo Zheng understood that the speed of cultivating the Wild God system depended on the quantity of the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng's body was special enough to have the capacity to absorb all of the Wild God Power in a bone.</p>

  <p>If he managed to find enough wild bones, his strength would grow faster still. He would become invincible.</p>

  <p>"It's time to leave..."</p>

  <p>With this thought, Luo Zheng shrank his body back, and returned to the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>    </p>
