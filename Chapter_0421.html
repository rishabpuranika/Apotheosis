  <p>
</p>

  <p>In contrast, Johanson had decided to kill Luo Luo Zheng. And so, Luo Luo Zheng had no scruples anymore!</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng had been on his guard for Johanson's killing intent since the very beginning. And Luo Luo Zheng could tell that Saint Zara and Saint Viana were behind all this. Nonetheless, he couldn't be sure. Therefore, he would not point it out in front of all the disciples of Cloud Sect as he had no evidence yet.</p>

  <p>While keeping a lookout for Johanson, Luo Luo Zheng also figured out what he was thinking. If Johanson wanted to have a prolonged tangle with Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>However, now that Johanson was enraged by his one remark, Luo Luo Zheng knew that despite his great power, he was not a very skilled assassin. And that was why Luo Luo Zheng just flopped onto the ground and said offensive things that would lead the disciples of Cloud Sect to provoke Johanson further.</p>

  <p>As Johanson felt that Luo Luo Zheng had blocked his soul attack, his expression changed!</p>

  <p>He came to realize that he had made a huge mistake!</p>

  <p>'The soul attack of Luo Luo Zheng that Vale just described is definitely one of his trump cards!</p>

  <p>How can it be? How is it possible? His body is already formidably strong for a man at the second-grade of the nature level, but how can his soul be so tough as well? My soul attack didn't hurt him at all? Is he a human being?'</p>

  <p>Just as Johanson was trying to rationalize his opponent's abilities, Luo Luo Zheng had launched his counterattack, the Spiritual Thorn.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the soul thorn pierced Johanson's brain. Johanson felt a powerful force assault his soul, and the pain caused nearly sent him into a coma.</p>

  <p>But compared to Luo Zheng's prior opponents, Johanson's performance was fairly great.</p>

  <p>As Johanson had been nourishing his soul since childhood, his soul was far stronger than that of a normal practitioner's. Hence, Johanson's soul managed to withstand Luo Zheng's Spiritual Thorn.</p>

  <p>As a result, even though Johanson was in excruciating pain, he did not pass out. He might have lost the match on the spiritual level, but he still had his snake-shaped short sword.</p>

  <p>'Once this snake-shaped short sword penetrates Luo Zheng's body, there is absolutely no hope for him.'</p>

  <p>However, precisely at this moment, he saw the broken flying knife emerge in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>'A broken knife?' Johanson snorted. 'He wants to repel my snake-shaped short sword with that thing?'</p>

  <p>His snake-shaped short sword was a fairy weapon!</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's broken flying knife were also a fairy weapon, after being damaged, the heavenly essence it contained would disperse as time went by. The more severe the damage, the faster its heavenly essence would dissipate.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the broken flying knife in Luo Zheng's hand, Johanson assumed that it was, at best, as powerful as a low-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>And he had no chance of stopping Johanson's snake-shaped short sword.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the two weapons clashed, Johanson was dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>The broken flying knife in Luo Zheng's hand knocked the snake-shaped short sword into the air. And Johanson's eyes widened when he saw that the clash left a distinct dent in the blade of his snake-shaped short sword!</p>

  <p>What surprised him more was that the dent had not been caused by a right-angled collision of two flying blades. It was merely an outcome of the snake-shaped short sword flitting across the broken flying knife from one side.</p>

  <p>If the two had collided head-on, Johanson's snake-shaped short sword would probably have broken!</p>

  <p>'What the hell is that broken flying knife? How can it still be so powerful even when it's damaged!'</p>

  <p>Johanson was stupefied. While he was frozen in place by the shock he felt, the broken flying knife soared toward his forehead. When Johanson realized what was happening, he was scared out of his wits. If the broken flying knife injured him, he would die.</p>

  <p>The instinct for survival suddenly surged inside Johanson. He leaned back to dodge the broken flying knife. The escape was narrow as the broken flying knife did scrape Johanson's forehead as it skimmed over his face. Fortunately, the gash wasn't too deep.</p>

  <p>When Johanson drew himself back, he hid among the shadows in midair.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng jumped to his feet with a jeer, beckoned with his left hand, and the broken flying knife flew back to his hand.</p>

  <p>The two fought at top speed. This time, it happened in a blink of an eye, but it was way more dangerous than any previous battles.</p>

  <p>The disciples also realized that Luo Luo Zheng and Johanson were risking their lives in this battle!</p>

  <p>The seriousness of the contenders and the stakes were so high that the disciples watched the fight with bated breath! Then, they were dazed for quite a while before they began to discuss it.</p>

  <p>"How risky! I never knew that Luo Luo Zheng has a weapon! His weapon is a broken flying knife!"</p>

  <p>"That knife is definitely not a normal knife. The snake-shaped short sword that Johanson is holding is a fairy weapon. But when Luo Zheng's damaged flying knife clashed into it, the snake-shaped short sword got a dent, while the broken flying knife was still intact. This means the broken flying knife is at a much higher grade than the fairy weapon!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is indeed hiding his true potential and his attack strategies. I wonder what else he's got!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, you're so ignorant! Let me tell you what else Luo Luo Zheng has got. Just now when Luo Luo Zheng and Johanson attacked each other with their weapons, they were also engaged in another fight? a battle on the spiritual level. It seems that Johanson lost to Luo Luo Zheng, and he suffered from that soul combat."</p>

  <p>There was a large assembly of talents at the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Although a moment ago Luo Luo Zheng and Johanson concluded an attack in just one second, only a handful of people had caught on to what had really happened.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>At those words, many disciples showed disbelief on their faces.</p>
