<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After half a year cultivating in the Dragon City, Luo Zheng wanted to test his own strength.</p>

  <p>Fergus coming here to challenge him was the perfect opportunity.</p>

  <p>Fergus held the Wild Snow Sword as his incomparably intense truth aura soared. At that moment, Luo Zheng saw a beast ready to attack.</p>

  <p>The aura that soared out of him had so much power and presence that many Alliance Chiefs unconsciously trembled out of fear.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe this. Fergus is actually getting serious." Ioan was taken aback as he felt the aura pervading from Fergus.</p>

  <p>Other Alliance Chiefs reacted with equal disbelief.</p>

  <p>Ioan had always boasted throughout the Dragon City that he was the number one Alliance Chief. He had, in addition, obtained the recognition of the other Alliance Chiefs.</p>

  <p>Walter and other Alliance Chiefs were inferior to him. This time, Ioan had successfully passed the examination and became a Oneness Guard, a title which everyone exclaimed he was worthy of. If he had failed, no one else could pass.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, others regarded Fergus as the weakest among the Alliance Chiefs. Not many deemed him to be fearful enough.</p>

  <p>Only then did Ioan realize that he underestimated Fergus.</p>

  <p>"Fergus has hidden his strength so well."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen him fight before?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody in the Dragon City dares to offend him, so we never had the chance to see him at full strength."</p>

  <p>Plastered across the Alliance Chiefs' faces were bitter smiles. Only now did they realize their mistake in underestimating Fergus.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked grave as Fergus' aura kept soaring.</p>

  <p>He didn't know much about the Alliance Chiefs, but he thought their cultivation was similar to that of one-star Oneness Guards. The Taiyi Heaven Palace was a force as influential as the Bearing race, so Luo Zheng assumed that Fergus was on par with one-star Yellow Emperor Guards. In terms of strength, he would be just like Hamish and Zavier.</p>

  <p>The aura that he saw from Fergus now was beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>"Since you are provoking me deliberately, then I'll do what you want."</p>

  <p>Fergus was not as stupid as he looked. Of course, he was aware of what Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>However, he still couldn't understand one thing. Why did Luo Zheng dare to challenge him? Even if he had innate superhuman strength, he'd just reached the first stage of Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Your reliance or any late bouts of regret doesn't matter now," said Fergus with a sinister expression.</p>

  <p>He then stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The soft soil suddenly cracked and collapsed.</p>

  <p>Fergus did not even flinch. He merely stood there, motionless, as if nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>Everyone went quiet while some retreated to a distance, not wanting to get hurt accidentally. Even so, such a fight between powerhouses was still destructive.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The very next second, Fergus vanished from where he stood and rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He acted so swiftly that no spectator even had time to react.</p>

  <p>Even several Alliance Chiefs' jaws dropped at the unexpected sight.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng kept up with him.</p>

  <p>Although he had always provoked Fergus, there was no instance that he would underestimate him.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Wild Snow Sword started to cut towards his head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen too many powerful sword strikes and thought of this one as a standard move, but the strike actually provided him with a decent illusion.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to face it head on.</p>

  <p>No matter what method he resorted to, he would be cut in half.</p>

  <p>"This sword strike..."</p>

  <p>A thought crossed Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"It's the Flow Strike!"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that Fergus has mastered it!"</p>

  <p>"He has such immense talent. Why would he stay in the Dragon City?"</p>

  <p>Many of the Alliance Chiefs who witnessed Fergus' sword strike were left puzzled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had heard of the Flow Strike before. The Flow Swordsmanship could be found in one of the light columns on the Truth Library's third floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng became interested in the Flow Swordsmanship after hearing of it from the guard of the Truth Library.</p>

  <p>It was said that its user could read their opponent's mind and make perfect judgments through subtle changes. The user would also go into a flow state, completely absorbed in their actions. They could make the best decision calmly even in the face of an extremely powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, there was a major sect called Flow Sword Sect in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and the Flow Swordsmanship was the most powerful sword skill of the sect.</p>

  <p>However, the guard of the Truth Library noted the high threshold needed to learn the Flow Swordsmanship. He said that the manual alone wasn't enough. In order to thoroughly learn it, one had to go to the Flow Tower in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Though he was curious, Luo Zheng ignored this supreme swordsmanship manual because it was unsuitable at the time.</p>

  <p>As he faced Fergus' sword attack, Luo Zheng finally understood the feeling of the Flow Strike.</p>

  <p>He couldn't dodge it, but he had to.</p>

  <p>Fergus had forced him into a corner with just one strike.</p>

  <p>No wonder the Flow Strike was a supreme skill.</p>

  <p>Any other Alliance Chiefs would be in a dead end. Unfortunately for Fergus, Luo Zheng was a different story.</p>

  <p>Even though Fergus was infinitely strong, Luo Zheng had no need to dodge.</p>

  <p>"The Three Annihilation Strike!"</p>

  <p>After extracting power from the demonic eye, Luo Zheng gripped the Snow Sword tighter as it glimmered with mixed colors. Three interconnected strands of the Ways-blending Energy covered the sword's surface.</p>

  <p>Then their swords struck against each other.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A dazzling white light surrounded the two again as the Three Annihilation Strike caused an explosion.</p>

  <p>Fergus' face twitched slightly as he felt the impact from Luo Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just unleashed the force of twenty Jun, striking power that was still far from his limits.</p>

  <p>However, Fergus himself fell into the flow state as he launched the Flow Strike. All the emotions that rattled him were quickly offset. He would attack like a puppet, striking repeatedly until he killed his opponent.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's Three Annihilation Strike sent him flying, he quickly turned around and made another chop. The strike was similar to the one before, and once again Luo Zheng could not dodge.</p>

  <p>Fergus struck with his sword for the second time before the light of the first Three Annihilation Strike even disappeared.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Those who had retreated in the distance could only see enormous balls of light gleaming one after another on the plain. The sight made the deafening sounds seem like thunder.</p>

  <p>The people who stayed nearby, on the other hand, either lay on the ground or stared at the two in shock.</p>

  <p>They could barely distinguish the two faint shadows clashing against each other. They didn't know how the fight was turning out.</p>

  <p>"Fergus is so powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Who said that he was an unqualified Alliance Chief? I think he is even more powerful than Ioan."</p>

  <p>"Hey, don't forget his opponent."</p>

  <p>Upon admiring Fergus, they came to realize that they paid attention to the wrong person.</p>

  <p>Fighting Fergus in the white light balls was Luo Zheng, who had just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Despite being merely in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, he could already keep up with the powerful Fergus.</p>

  <p>As they witnessed the ongoing battle, the group felt ashamed. Unlike Luo Zheng, they felt that they had never progressed even years after reaching the first stage.</p>
