<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Collecting as much information as he could, Luo Zheng had already prepared himself for the dangers of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>However, upon hearing what the master of Soul Sea Realm said, Luo Zheng was more sure that the Dark Nether Cave was an extremely dangerous place.</p>

  <p>About seventy top-level war lords had joined forces to explore this place, but in the end, all of them had perished. What was hiding in the core area of the Dark Nether Cave?</p>

  <p>'Mist knew very well that it is extremely difficult and dangerous to explore the Dark Nether Cave, yet he sent me here. Is this one of his tricks?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself. However, nothing stopped him.</p>

  <p>The chance to enter the cave was immensely tempting for other creatures, too, but it was of utmost importance for Luo Zheng. It was an opportunity he might not get again. He had no intention of missing it.</p>

  <p>Despite a hint of bitterness in his smile, Miguel believed in Luo Zheng. He also knew it was useless to prevent him from getting inside such a dangerous place.</p>

  <p>That particular trip to the human sacred place was more symbolic than literal.</p>

  <p>Led by Olivia, Luo Zheng attracted enough attention and gained applause wherever they passed by.</p>

  <p>The younger generation of the Purple Heart Sacred Place seemed to have a great deal of interest in Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the younger generation, Luo Zheng was unbeatable. His unique way of taking over the Tower of Sin and his ability to drive the ogres away were achievements that no one else could surpass.</p>

  <p>The humans grew an intense curiosity towards Luo Zheng. How could someone so young have achieved so much for his unripe age?</p>

  <p>Although incomparable to the objects he got from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Luo Zheng was glad to receive rewards from the Purple Heart Sacred Place members.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place gave him a top-grade sacred long sword. Even if Amber had plans of giving that sacred weapon to Xun, it was Luo Zheng that obtained it eventually. Everything had its rightful owner indeed.</p>

  <p>The treasures and resources of the human's sacred place were less than that of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, but Luo Zheng perfectly understood the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Asking him to inform the Demon Night that the Purple Heart Sacred Place had intended to ally with the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Miguel sent Luo Zheng to the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Truly, Luo Zheng had driven the ogres away from the Tower of Sin, but how were they to deal with the two sacred places of the ogre?</p>

  <p>If the two ogre sacred places were to declare war on the Purple Heart Sacred Place again, the humans would have no way to resist without the interference of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Although races seldom got any benefit from the alliance between different races, Miguel, who knew the relationship between Luo Zheng and the Demon Night, still hoped that Luo Zheng would be able to help him with this matter. At the very least, humans would be able to obtain the protection of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place before the Purple Heart Sacred Place became strong and powerful enough to stand on their own.</p>

  <p>Well-aware of Miguel's worries, Luo Zheng didn't consider this matter as unimportant. Besides, because of his close relationship with Xun, this planned alliance between two sacred places was fully possible.</p>

  <p>Upon his return to the Tower of Sin, Luo Zheng told Esther about this matter. After Esther accepted the deal, Luo Zheng did not meddle with it anymore. After all, no matter what kind of price the Purple Heart Sacred Place paid and how many years they had to be protected by the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, there was no need for Luo Zheng to do anything about that. That was the negotiation between Miguel and Amber.</p>

  <p>In the following days, Luo Zheng continued to cultivate himself.</p>

  <p>The required points at the Tower of Sin were not of Zheng's concern anymore.</p>

  <p>He was free to do as he pleased.</p>

  <p>In order to gain more time for cultivation, Luo Zheng used the practicing rooms that were under the time flow rate spell.</p>

  <p>However, it was different for matters concerning the arena.</p>

  <p>War lords knew how unlikely it was for them to defeat Luo Zheng in any way, but there were still those who had the guts to challenge him. Even some from the human race wanted a piece of him.</p>

  <p>Compared to the battles before, the existing ones were not as intense. Now, fighting would cease after Zheng's victory, and there were no fatal injuries.</p>

  <p>Months passed in just a blink of an eye. Zheng's opponents were now seventh-level war lords.</p>

  <p>As his opponents continued to change, Luo Zheng climbed higher and higher until he reached the fourteenth floor of the Tower of Sin. At that time, he was already able to challenge some top-level war lords with weaker talents. Luo Zheng was also promoted as a ninth-level war general.</p>

  <p>In addition to his cultivation base, Luo Zheng also focused on his own methods and techniques, including the Stellar Body and the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death. With all these, he had made significant progress. It was impressive.</p>

  <p>Walking out of his practicing room that day, Luo Zheng had noticed some drastic changes in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The walls of the tower were covered with a faint red glow which was constantly flowing. The glow also appeared on the floor and the ceiling.</p>

  <p>These lights resembled blood which flowed along the meridians of the human body.</p>

  <p>"Weapon spirit, talk to me. What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The weapon spirit lived in the walls of the tower. Luo Zheng had the ability to communicate with it so long as he was in the tower.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Nether Death Light has weakened," the weapon spirit stated blankly.</p>

  <p>"It has weakened! Is the Dark Nether Cave open?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, his voice filled with both excitement and curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the weapon spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"The time has come,"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes shot up. As he took a step forward, the ground beneath his feet began to split open, taking him to the top of the tower from the fourteenth floor.</p>

  <p>In the hall at the top, many top-level war lords appeared. All of them entered at once, clearly aware that the constant flow of the red light meant the opening of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! The cave has opened itself!" Fabian exclaimed upon seeing him.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>No one knew the exact time when the Dark Nether Cave would finally open. Only predictions and assumptions were made.</p>

  <p>When the Dark Nether Cave opened in the past, only twenty human warriors were allowed entry as they only had a total of four seats at the Tower of Sin. Now that their seat number had increased, more of them could now explore the cave.</p>

  <p>More warriors to enter meant a bigger chance to gather riches!</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave was enormous. If one was lucky enough, great opportunities were granted even just on the outer layer of the cave.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the cave had its limits. It didn't just grow resources out of the blue. It could run out of them. This was also why the number of seats was limited.</p>

  <p>Beforehand, Fabian had already collected the names of the warriors and allocated their places accordingly. The other races with seats in the tower also gathered their members.</p>

  <p>There were a total of one hundred and twenty-eight seats in the tower. Each seat was allocated five warriors who were allowed to get in the cave. Plenty of war lords and war generals who were able to take a spot and reached the top of the tower were all preparing themselves for the journey into the cave.</p>

  <p>The spacious hall became a little crowded as the number of warriors grew.</p>

  <p>"Yolande?"</p>

  <p>Among the crowd, Luo Zheng was able to find her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng learned from Xun that Yolande was the incarnation of a master in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was not strange for Yolande to be ranked first at the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>But, according to Xun, Yolande's duplicates didn't pursue the growth of cultivation and just continued to practice.</p>

  <p>Despite staying on the tenth floor for such a long time, Yolande failed to increase her cultivation. She also didn't climb to the higher floor of the tower.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's surprised expression, Fabian was quick to explain, "Yolande has taken the initiative to apply for a spot to enter the cave, so I gave her the permission."</p>

  <p>Yolande was human after all. Despite this, her talent was ranked in the first row. Moreover, Yolande's contributions to the humans over the years were substantial and significant. It was appropriate for her to get a chance to enter the cave.</p>

  <p>Yolande casually walked over to Luo Zheng. She stared at him and said, "I will go with you on this trip to the cave."</p>

  <p>The confusion enveloping Luo Zheng grew. Being in the Tower of Sin for so long, Yolande definitely had so many chances of entering the cave. But why now? Why did she choose to follow him?</p>

  <p>Before he had the chance to say anything, a beam of red light shot up from Zheng's body. It slowly began to take the shape of a Demon Night. That was no other than Zheng's sword spirit, Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun, as calm as ever, looked at Yolande and said, "Luo Zheng, don't let her come with you."</p>

  <p>"This… Why?" Keeping the good impression he had of Yolande, Luo Zheng felt strange. Since she chose to be on his side, he thought allowing Yolande to come with him wasn't such a big deal.</p>

  <p>"You know what's in the cave, right?" Xun asked Yolande while walking over to where she was.</p>

  <p>Xun's words immediately attracted the attention of many top-level war lords in the hall. In their eyes, Yolande's and Xun's origins were mystical. It was possible that they knew something not everyone else did.</p>

  <p>At that certain moment, everyone was all ears to the ongoing banter between the two mystical ladies before them. After all, the more they knew about the cave, the more their survival chance increased.</p>
