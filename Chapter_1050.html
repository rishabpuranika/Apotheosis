  <p>
</p>

  <p>"But...but..." the person reporting the information stammered.</p>

  <p>"You can't even speak properly. What a stupid good-for-nothing you are!"</p>

  <p>Xiao snapped furiously. The person reporting the matter was one of his subordinates for whom he had high hopes. The fellow was usually calm and steady, but today, he was blabbering like a moron.</p>

  <p>Xiao felt something was amiss. "What happened exactly?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There...there are a lot of people outside, many warriors," the flustered man said.</p>

  <p>"Many warriors? What level of strength do they have?" Xiao asked again.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. Sir, you'd better check it out personally," the man suggested.</p>

  <p>Xiao snorted coldly. His puzzlement grew. 'What kind of warriors are these who have scared the life out of him?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>He walked out of his residence and looked up. He saw around a hundred people floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>"What kind of strength..." he muttered as he looked at the army of warriors.</p>

  <p>He inhaled sharply and cold air filled his nose, making him cough violently.</p>

  <p>"Hem..."</p>

  <p>Xiao was a warrior at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw the scene above him, he could not stop coughing, as if he could no longer control his body.</p>

  <p>"Life and Death Realm experts!</p>

  <p>They are all Life and Death Realm experts!</p>

  <p>There must be about a hundred of them!</p>

  <p>No, the first few are not Life and Death Realm experts. They are far more powerful! Are they the legendary Soul Sea Realm experts?" Xiao finally stopped coughing with great difficulty. His eyes were wide with disbelief.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my God!'</p>

  <p>After a momentary lapse, Xiao's mind began to work quickly.</p>

  <p>'These martial artists can't possibly be from the Central Region. There's only one possibility: they must be from the four divine kingdoms on the other side of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.'</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect had fought against World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall in Oracle City. The news had spread throughout the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>People had also been spreading news that the York Divine Kingdom was about to invade the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, Xiao was not anxious. His sect was merely a third-grade one.</p>

  <p>Even if the York Divine Kingdom really did occupy the Central Region, he could choose to submit to it.</p>

  <p>Back when the Heavenly Evil Sect was rampant, the Fish Dragon Sect didn't fight back and chose to become a member of the former sect. Even Xiao himself had declared that he wanted to join the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom and become a member of the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Evil Sect attacked Oracle City, Xiao used the sect's affairs as an excuse to not participate in the battle.</p>

  <p>Eddie had never taken the Fish Dragon Sect seriously.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Evil Sect was destroyed, the Fish Dragon Sect had not been affected at all.</p>

  <p>It was precisely this strategy that allowed the Fish Dragon Sect to remain safe and sound. Therefore, he wasn't too worried when the York Divine Kingdom attacked.</p>

  <p>But he was astonished now because of the strength of the four divine kingdoms. If York Divine Kingdom could easily send out ten Soul Sea Realm experts, just imagine how powerful the four divine kingdoms could become.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng would be in trouble. The previous time, the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall had escaped, but this time, they would not be able to save themselves.</p>

  <p>Xiao had already determined their fate in his heart.</p>

  <p>Around a hundred people were floating steadily in the sky. Miguel looked at the many humans below and faintly smiled to the others. "I will be the one to ask for directions. After all, they are humans just like me," he said and darted down towards the Fish Dragon Sect.</p>

  <p>The Fish Dragon Sect had their own sect-protecting array. But they didn't have any thoughts of resisting a powerful warrior of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Miguel casually flew towards Xiao. "You! Tell me, where is Oracle City?" he asked coolly.</p>

  <p>Xiao immediately broke into a smile. Indeed, his guess was correct! These fellows had come from the four divine kingdoms, and they were heading towards Oracle City. He hurriedly said, "It is in the southwest."</p>

  <p>He also quickly pulled out a map from his space ring. This map was specifically drawn for Xiao and was extremely detailed. All sorts of geographical names were drawn out using golden lines.</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is a map of the Central Region. Follow the markings on it and you will find the city," he offered with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Not bad," Miguel said coldly. He wouldn't deem it necessary to be polite to a war lord. Moreover, the man in front of him was only a fifth-grade war lord. He could barely spare him so much as a glance. After putting away the map, Miguel didn't even bother thanking the helpful stranger. He casually tossed an item down and flew back up towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The hundred people immediately turned into beams of light and flew southwest.</p>

  <p>Xiao relaxed after they left. The auras of those experts were like mountains crushing them and making it difficult for them to breathe.</p>

  <p>Only when he was sure that the experts had gone far enough did Xiao take a look at that item. He discovered an ordinary-looking dagger and his eyes suddenly emitted an intense light and even his voice began to tremble.</p>

  <p>"This...this... is a...a...sacred weapon."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, the informant was indignant. Xiao had previously taught him that cultivating martial arts required a peaceful heart. How could Xiao himself be so excited now?</p>

  <p>Of course, he did not dare to say this out loud. He could only stare blankly at an ecstatic Xiao.</p>

  <p>Even the weakest among the hundred warriors was a Life and Death Realm warrior. How powerful it would be when a hundred of them flew up at the same time!</p>

  <p>This high-speed of the army of hundred beams of light caused quite a stir in the Central Region. Some martial artists thought that some treasures had appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>One day later, the experts finally arrived in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>There were countless craftsmen working day and night to repair the city walls, which had been destroyed during the war. Restoration would be a huge, time-consuming project.</p>

  <p>"Look, what's that?" A craftsman suddenly discovered the rays of light shooting in his direction, as if it was a meteor shower.</p>

  <p>When the warriors heard him, they also raised their heads and looked towards the horizon.</p>

  <p>When one of the city guards saw this, he panicked. He rushed towards the tower. There was a large bell atop the tower. The guard hastily rang it.</p>

  <p>It was a warning bell. As it rang, so did the rest of the bells in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Soon, the tolls reverberated in the entire city.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Have the powerhouses from the divine kingdom arrived? So fast!"</p>

  <p>"How should we deal with them this time?"</p>

  <p>The martial artists of Oracle City were in a tizzy.</p>

  <p>An Internal Elixir Realm warrior stood on the wall and inspected the situation. In the end, he mumbled, "There are around a hundred Life and Death Realm martial artists. How can we deal with them?"</p>

  <p>As the bells rang, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance and about twenty Virtual Tribulation Realm elders flew over. They gathered together, looking at the experts in the sky, horrified.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had said that he would ask Soul Sea Realm experts to help him, but Dillon and the others knew the reality. It would be a miracle even if one or two arrived.</p>

  <p>A favor from a powerful warrior of the Soul Sea Realm wouldn't come easy. It would cost a lot.</p>

  <p>But it didn't matter how many of them would come to their rescue. Even with only one or two Soul Sea Realm experts holding the fort in Oracle City, there would be a better chance of fighting against the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>After all, the York Divine Kingdom wouldn't send too many Soul Sea Realm experts to the Central Region. Although the divine kingdom was far more powerful than the Central Region, the Soul Sea Realm experts were more valuable. They wouldn't dispatch all their experts just to suppress the tiny Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, it was the experts of the divine kingdom who had arrived before the Soul Sea Realm experts Luo Luo Zheng had mentioned.</p>

  <p>"There are nine Soul Sea Realm experts and ninety Life and Death Realm experts." Dillon said bitterly, "It doesn't matter anymore whether Luo Zheng's reinforcements come or not."</p>
