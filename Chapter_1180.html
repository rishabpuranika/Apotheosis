<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Two snow flood dragons' lair was originally built in the middle of the mountain, but suddenly, the entire mountain disappeared and the dragons began to fall down. Luckily, they managed to fly up. They were intelligent beings, but they still couldn't understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>How did a mighty mountain just disappear all of a sudden?</p>

  <p>However, what happened next left these dragons flabbergasted. The towering mountains in front of them were rapidly disappearing. The moment those mountains started to collapse, they would disappear!</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>There were not many people in the western part of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>About fifty to sixty thousand mountains sat right next to each other. Even if a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior wanted to cross over such a large mountain range, it would probably take him very long.</p>

  <p>Right this moment, these mountains were getting annihilated within seconds...</p>

  <p>This strange scene was not taking place only in the western part of the Central Region, but all over the entire Central Region. All the mountains were being destroyed!</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance were holding a meeting on a small, thousand-foot-high mountain on the southern side of Oracle City. All of the investors of the World Commercial Alliance attended the meeting. Now, only the World Commercial Alliance stood out in the Central Region. However, Dillon did not hold any ambitions of forming a sacred place. The World Commercial Alliance was indeed a powerful force, but the members were all merchants after all.</p>

  <p>However, suddenly in the middle of the meeting, the small mountain started to collapse.</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked, and before they could figure out what happened, the ground beneath their feet had disappeared. The entire mountain was instantly erased...</p>

  <p>"Are we under attack?" an Internal Elixir Realm warrior shouted. Although they had recouped from the previous attack of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom, it had left a deep impression on many warriors.</p>

  <p>"Attack? Damn it!" Hobbes, who was floating in the air, cursed loudly.</p>

  <p>Many warriors could destroy a mountain, so could Hobbes and the others. It was not so difficult, but nobody could do it in an instant! This remarkable skill had captured their imaginations!</p>

  <p>An even more intense crumbling sound followed and the White Mountain, which was fifteen thousand feet tall, suddenly disappeared from Oracle City!</p>

  <p>In Oracle City, as long as people looked to the south, they would be able to see the black shadow of the White Mountain. It stood like a giant guarding the south of Oracle City. But now it had vanished without a trace!</p>

  <p>"The...the White Mountain has also been annihilated..."</p>

  <p>Hobbes swallowed hard. Fear was reflected in everyone's eyes; they had no idea what was happening.</p>

  <p>One by one, the mountains vanished into thin air...</p>

  <p>In this way, almost a hundred thousand mountains disappeared! These mountains, no matter how high they were, were all obliterated by an unstoppable force.</p>

  <p>The Central Region, the Divine Kingdom Continent, the Sea God Continent and that was not all...</p>

  <p>Every mountain in the whole great world was getting wiped off the face of the planet.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still pitch black, as if he had just crawled out of a black quagmire. He stood still but his mind was spinning rapidly. Through his memory, which was constantly updating, he was able to find out how many mountains were left in the whole great world!</p>

  <p>Five million mountains...</p>

  <p>Four million mountains...</p>

  <p>Three million mountains...</p>

  <p>Two million mountains...</p>

  <p>One million...</p>

  <p>'Is there no way to withstand the power of this black light if all the mountains are wiped out?' Zheng thought to himself, his eyes flickering.</p>

  <p>He could feel the power that the black light was continuously releasing.</p>

  <p>There was no way to know how much power it had. It was a terrifying thought. However, Zheng still had mighty backup forces behind him— the sea and continents.</p>

  <p>Zheng chose not to transfer the power of the black light to the sea.</p>

  <p>In order to resist the Heavenly Tribulation before, Zheng had transferred most of the power into the Feather Holy Sea, causing a huge tsunami. It might have caused immeasurable loss. The warriors were not afraid of the tsunami, but ordinary people would get injured or even killed by it.</p>

  <p>Eventually it was brought under control by the Soul Sea Realm masters, who saved the four divine kingdoms from being destroyed.</p>

  <p>If the power of this black light was transferred to the sea of the entire great world, it might cause a tsunami of unimaginable proportions, perhaps tens or even hundreds of thousands of feet high. Perhaps the Sea God Continent, the Divine Kingdom Continent and even the Central Region would be totally obliterated, and most of the creatures would be annihilated. This was why Zheng didn't choose to transfer the power of the black light to the sea.</p>

  <p>And he also wasn't willing to transfer the power directly to the continents. If he transferred it to the vast Divine Kingdom Continent, he feared that it would collapse in an instant despite its size!</p>

  <p>However, if there was no other choice, he might be compelled to do so.</p>

  <p>But he wanted to avoid this catastrophic destruction as much as possible!</p>

  <p>In the world of warriors, the strong preyed on the weak and most of warriors were extremely conceited. But Zheng was different, he didn't want to attain power at the cost of billions of innocent lives.</p>

  <p>This was not to say that Zheng was kind-hearted and righteous, and he was sometimes as ruthless and cold as any great warrior, but he just did not want to lose the last trace of humanity. In this regard, he broke free from the so-called law of the jungle like a wild beast.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the countdown of destruction continued. Five hundred thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>Zheng gritted his teeth, his brows deeply furrowed in concentration.</p>

  <p>Three hundred thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>The speed at which the mountains were being annihilated far exceeded his imagination!</p>

  <p>Two hundred thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was beating faster and faster. He was about to face a difficult choice. Would he choose to die alone? Or would he sacrifice tens of millions of creatures?</p>

  <p>This was a very simple and selfish choice for many warriors, but it was too difficult for Zheng.</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand mountains...</p>

  <p>If the power of the black light still didn't weaken after all these mountains were destroyed, then Zheng might have to use the mountains in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>He thought about the Thirty-three Peaks where he used to stay. Countless disciples were cultivated there. Most of them were nature creatures that couldn't fly. If those peaks were destroyed, numerous disciples would die!</p>

  <p>Zheng was getting more and more distressed when he suddenly felt the black energy starting to weaken.</p>

  <p>This black light had arrived menacingly, but it had disappeared just as quickly. In the blink of an eye, Zheng's originally black body began to change as the black energy vanished!</p>

  <p>His body seemed to have been washed clean and it quickly returned to normal.</p>

  <p>"I have survived this encounter..." There was no trace of joy on his face.</p>

  <p>Instead, he appeared sad.</p>

  <p>He had indeed pulled through. While he was still in one piece, the entire great world had paid a huge price on his behalf.</p>

  <p>There were five million mountains in total destroyed. There might be a great number of living beings, including humans, which were sacrificed.</p>

  <p>"Zheng withstood the black light; it was unable to kill him. This guy is really..." Marine was so shocked that his breath got caught in her throat.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were also silent. They knew that Zheng was able to transfer the black light's power. The little monster from the Nine Furnace Martial House had displayed this ability more than once before.</p>

  <p>However, no one knew the limits of this ability. Could it be that there was no limit to how much power Zheng could transfer?</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters didn't know much about the black light's power. But the one thing they did know for certain was that it could destroy them all easily. Even if the number of the Soul Sea Realm masters increased by a hundred times, they still wouldn't be able to survive the black light!</p>

  <p>But Zheng was able to withstand this incredible attack. What had he sacrificed in order to do so? Where did he transfer the power?</p>

  <p>There were no mountains on the Feather Emperor Island, so many Soul Sea Realm masters had no clue that all of the mountains on the Divine Kingdom Continent had disappeared...</p>

  <p>Turner couldn't take the suspense, so he asked him directly, "Tianxing, I know you have transferred the power to some other place, but... where did you transfer the black light's power?"</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked before he replied, "Mountains..."</p>

  <p>"Mountains? How many mountains?" Turner asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The mountains of the whole world," Zheng responded sadly.</p>
