<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A range of emotions, complicatedly intertwined with each other, flitted across Derek's face as he learned that these seven were from the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race did not have a good reputation in the Upper World. It had a mixed background and a small population, but almost all of its members were elites.</p>

  <p>But the biggest problem was that they were a bunch of lunatics.</p>

  <p>Derek had originally hoped to scare these people by revealing the force that backed him. Although the force of the Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment was the weakest of the three great human powers, it still occupied 2, 000 Supreme Worlds. It wasn't inferior to any race.</p>

  <p>If he had known that these people belonged to the Celestial Position race, Derek wouldn't have even bothered to talk.</p>

  <p>The problem, however, was that he had to get the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms stood aside and did not say anything. After all, the Ancestral Dragon would not fall into their hands, no matter what happened. If Derek was powerful, he could just snatch it from their hands.</p>

  <p>Derek rolled his eyes before saying, "So you all are from the Celestial Position race. But I've been trying to get the Ancestral Dragon for— "</p>

  <p>Max interrupted Derek impatiently, "No matter how much effort you've put in, hoping for this bunch of natives to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land to obtain the Ancestral Dragon's egg was nothing more than a dream. We were the ones who hatched the Ancestral Dragon and took it out."</p>

  <p>Woody and the burly man were fiddling with the weapons in their hands, staring at Derek and grinning from time to time. It looked like they were quite eager to fight him.</p>

  <p>Derek said, "Even though you are from the Celestial Position race, you can't be so unreasonable— "</p>

  <p>Woody and the burly man were charging at him even before he could finish talking, trying to attack him without warning.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Supreme Realm warriors had a speed that was absolutely terrifying.</p>

  <p>The two men were aggressive as they attacked Derek, the crowd watching closely.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>But Derek was fast. As the two men moved forward, he retreated putting thousands of feet between them, shouting, "Stop! We can talk about it!"</p>

  <p>The small shield in his hand transformed into a ray of multi-colored light, blocking any attack from the front.</p>

  <p>The two men cursed in unison, moving back to Max's side.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms sighed. These guys were truly tyrannical, not thinking a single jot about Derek.</p>

  <p>But Derek was a clever man. It looked like he could only look for help through the Reverse Spirit Channel. He looked at Luo Zheng, who was holding the Ancestral Dragon in his arms, and thought, 'If the Celestial Position warriors were not lying and they did indeed hatch the Ancestral Dragon, then why is the Ancestral Dragon following Tianxing?'</p>

  <p>Max didn't care about what was on Derek's mind. Their goal was simple: to verify if Luo Zheng really had obtained a title from the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>And as for the Ancestral Dragon that was following Luo Zheng, they wouldn't take it back for now.</p>

  <p>"Since you really possess the mark of our race, the next step is to find the Tower of Crystal," Max said as he walked towards Luo Zheng. His tone became much gentler because he could feel the mark of his own race on Zheng's body. And right now, he could truly see Luo Zheng as one of his own.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He would never get involved in the dispute between Derek and the Celestial Position race. "Of course. I will take you to the Tower of Crystal."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze now concentrated on Brianna's body, and at the same time, he asked the cyan dragon, "Can we do something to help Brianna?"</p>

  <p>"She is affected by the Soul Sealing Spell. Although her body is alive, it's like she is dead. Only if someone can break the Soul Sealing Spell will she be able to recover. But the Soul Sealing Spell is a secret technique of the Soul Race, and the creatures mastering it are too few," the cyan dragon answered and sighed. The nine Genuine Dragons shared a deep bond with Brianna, which was why, naturally, the cyan dragon was very concerned about her.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had brought Brianna out, the cyan dragon naturally hoped to help her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw Dorothea walking towards Brianna, disappointment etched on her face.</p>

  <p>"Is this just an empty shell? A soulless body?" She reached out to touch Brianna's face, ignoring Zheng's presence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless at the scene playing out before him.</p>

  <p>Dorothea was indeed strange. He knew that Brianna probably started getting angry within her inner world.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, Brianna's consciousness suddenly spread out. "How dare you say I'm a soulless body!"</p>

  <p>"Huh? Another soul in the body?" Dorothea looked pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to Dorothea and said, "Her soul has been sealed within the inner world."</p>

  <p>"Sealed in the inner world?" Dorothea frowned, but then her eyes lit up and she asked, "The Soul Sealing Spell?"</p>

  <p>Although it was a secret technique of the Soul Race, the Soul Sealing Spell was very famous. And Dorothea was already proficient in soul cultivation methods. She guessed the reason behind Brianna's soul being sealed within the inner world the moment she heard of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, a plan forming in his mind. The cyan dragon couldn't break the Soul Sealing Spell. But could Dorothea do it? Weren't there a lot of capable people in the Celestial Position race?</p>

  <p>"Hey, can you help her break the spell?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothea became serious. Only those who knew about the Soul Sealing Spell would understand how difficult it was to break it. She thought for a moment and then seemed to make up her mind before saying, "I can break it, but..."</p>

  <p>'She can do it!' Luo Zheng was overjoyed, and quickly asked, "But what?"</p>

  <p>"But there is a condition!" she answered.</p>

  <p>"What condition?" Brianna spoke first this time, before Luo Zheng could even open his mouth to speak.</p>

  <p>For the last 100, 000 years, because of the Soul Sealing Spell, she had obtained longevity that far surpassed an ordinary warrior's. Her body had even stopped aging, and the Five Aging Processes had yet to descend. In truth, the Soul Sealing Spell was also one of the ways that warriors from the Upper World used to extend their lifespans.</p>

  <p>The problem was that over the past few years, she had been only able to build her own world within her inner body slowly. She felt rather lonely.</p>

  <p>Brianna hoped, even in her dreams, that someone would be able to break the Soul Sealing Spell.</p>

  <p>Now that Dorothea was saying that she could help her solve this problem, Brianna was extremely excited, no matter how much she hated Dorothea.</p>

  <p>Dorothea giggled, temporarily forgetting about Luo Zheng and returning to be her cheerful self. She smiled and said, "The condition is that you have to marry me. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Ahem!" Luo Zheng began coughing violently.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race warriors shook their heads in exasperation.</p>

  <p>They knew about Dorothea's personality and her sexual orientation very well.</p>

  <p>Brianna was silent, not knowing what to say at that moment.</p>

  <p>She was not like Dorothea. She was not gay, and it was impossible for her to fall in love with a woman, but the Soul Sealing Spell was much more torturous when compared to the prospect of being married to her.</p>

  <p>At Brianna's silence, Dorothea blinked and said, "You also know that breaking the Soul Sealing Spell is going to be quite troublesome. I have to ask someone to help me, and I will have to pay a heavy price. This condition isn't too much, is it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head, but didn't say anything. He didn't have anything to do with the relationship between these two women.</p>

  <p>He had left the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. He had also obtained the Ancestral Dragon and the life crystals to save Ning Yudie. He would first return to the Central Region to wake Ning Yudie up, and then bring this bunch of people to the Sea God Continent to find the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what Brianna and Dorothea were talking about, but in the end, Dorothea flashed a very satisfied smile. It looked like the two of them had reached an agreement.</p>

  <p>Max said to Luo Zheng, "We better not stay here any longer. Since you know where the Tower of Crystal is, take us there immediately!"</p>
