<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Zheng's figure disappeared from the Eternal Scroll Painting, the fox girl remained where she stood without moving an inch as though she were paralyzed.</p>

  <p>When she snapped out of it, she noticed a white light dot flickering above the void.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's gaze followed the white dot of light as it floated above for a while before it finally slid down towards the exit of the Eternal Scroll Painting. She heaved a sigh of relief and then turned to look at the face that was bruised to the point of no recognition by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Confronted by Zheng's fearsome relentless attack, the face of the brush-wielder gave in and was smashed beyond repair.</p>

  <p>"Master brush-wielder... are you alright?" the fox girl called out to him in a concerned voice.</p>

  <p>As the words left her mouth, the pieces that once sprawled lifeless on the Eternal Scroll Painting regained their lost vitality and slowly crawled their way towards the face of the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder raised his face carefully as though it were as delicate as porcelain.</p>

  <p>At this moment, his face portrayed a strange calmness to it as he remained in his place without uttering a word. He was neither laughing nor crying.</p>

  <p>"Please speak to me, Master brush-wielder. Are you alright?" the fox girl asked once again, her tone brimming with undying concern for him.</p>

  <p>"I was born with the Eternal Scroll Painting. As long as it is not destroyed, I won't die. Don't worry. I'm fine," the brush-wielder replied. His tone showed no hints of anger when he addressed the fox girl after he recovered from his wounds.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we were able to deceive the downgrader just now..." The fox girl voiced her worried thoughts out loud.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be a problem." The brush-wielder sighed softly.</p>

  <p>Compared to the creatures of the third-grade and fourth-grade worlds, the brush-wielder held more knowledge about the boring life in the Wall World. Everything within that world was divided by length, and it was free from any sort of thickness. Even if there were any sort of life being born within the second-grade world after a long time, those lives would be proclaimed the weakest and the lowest of all lives present there.</p>

  <p>In fact, the third-grade world was the lowest limit of life diversification. It was the Lower Extreme World after all, meaning it should be the lowest-grade world. If it continued to downgrade, the life it held within its borders would lose its sense of existence and the purpose attached to it.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder harbored deep-seated resentment for the second-grade world. But he was powerless against the downgrader, so the only option he was left with, was to cooperate with the fox girl to collectively play a trick on him.</p>

  <p>"It seems the downgrader is cautious about Zheng, so he must be afraid of him. Perhaps there is a chance that Zheng will succeed," the fox girl said with her eyes glowing with hope.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't give her a definite answer, the fox girl remained hopeful and pinned all her expectations on him.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng left the Eternal Scroll Painting, countless dots of white light gathered and shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng was completely surrounded and mesmerized by these light dots.</p>

  <p>His ability to keep track of time and distance disappeared without a trace, rendering him helpless.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng had already anticipated this scenario, so he came prepared.</p>

  <p>Before he could lose sight of everything, he contacted his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, are you ready?" Zheng asked as he prepared himself.</p>

  <p>If given a fair amount of time, coupled with the ancestry-level bloodline's ability, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization would have been fully replenished, or even more powerful compared to before.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the time it was granted was far too short to accomplish anything. It was also an extremely complicated task to construct the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>Even though the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had mastered the technology, they had only managed to build the core halfway.</p>

  <p>To prove itself useful to Zheng's cause, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization sealed the core forcibly. The moment it received Zheng's message, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization responded to his call and began to operate rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this," the Heavenly Obsession Civilization replied back to Zheng with confidence.</p>

  <p>"I need your help to decipher it!"</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best!"</p>

  <p>As it spoke, a ray of green light suddenly began to hover over Zheng's eyes, shrouding them in its influence.</p>

  <p>The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization took control of Zheng's eyes and ran his gaze, scanning each light dot one after the other to decipher their meaning. Once everything lay bare to it, it transferred the information gathered into Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Because its ability to calculate didn't have enough time to fully restore itself, the process was slower than usual.</p>

  <p>After five minutes of continuous repetition of this tedious process, a blurry picture revealed itself as it flashed before Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw four chains extending in four respective directions, and he also witnessed four obscure pillars standing in the distance...</p>

  <p>As this blurry scenery flashed before his eyes for a brief moment, Zheng was able to faintly determine his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>"This must be in the center of those four pillars!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey told me that he stays at the pillar on the north side...</p>

  <p>I need to get there!"</p>

  <p>Taking the help of the blurry picture alone wasn't enough for Zheng to successfully make his way over the long chain.</p>

  <p>However, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had a strong learning ability, which helped it to overcome any difficult task it was confronted with. It continued its vigorous attempts to explore the light dots. As a result, it successfully deciphered the rules behind their distribution. Soon, it picked up the pace and started restoring the scenes at a quicker rate, which made the picture clearer than before.</p>

  <p>But it would still take some time before the picture was as clear as day to maneuver Zheng's way to his destination without facing any difficulty...</p>

  <p>After Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting from the exit of the passageway, the Human Spirit King, Kincaid, descended to Pear Hill once more.</p>

  <p>He turned towards Tianming to relay his message to Geoffrey through the Lone Sword. "Your father is on his way to the main world. He should be able to reach the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. You can meet him there."</p>

  <p>The information was crucial.</p>

  <p>It was because it was inconvenient for Zheng to move as freely as Geoffrey could in the main world.</p>

  <p>It was better to let Geoffrey await Zheng's arrival at the exit than for Zheng to look for him instead.</p>

  <p>After hearing the message, Ziya wasted no time to run frantically towards Geoffrey and stood before him. "We should head to the Eternal Divine Courtyard immediately. Your father is supposed to meet you out there."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey remained calm as he kept his eyes closed and kept his breathing steady. He took his time to accumulate all his strength to prepare himself to meet Zheng.</p>

  <p>This body was entrusted to him by the Levitation Tower. So it should be the most powerful body in the entirety of Deep Space with a solid recovery ability.</p>

  <p>His body and soul suffered from exhaustion after being overexerted, but after he rested for quite a while, they began to show signs of recovery.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey only hoped the downgrader would not show up soon.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the main world was exceedingly large, so it would be hard for the downgrader to pinpoint Geoffrey's location at the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Ziya had said, Geoffrey opened his eyes slightly and asked, "Really? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am!" Ziya exclaimed, unable to mask his feelings.</p>

  <p>"Alright. Take me there..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Geoffrey declared his wish, his eyes fell on a creature flying over from afar, painted in several appealing colors. It was none other than the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>Although it was Geoffrey's first time witnessing the Starry Roc-fish in the flesh, he immediately sensed from its demeanor that the beautiful fish was seeking them out!</p>

  <p>Although the pillar under their feet was very wide, the surface of the pillar was quite bare. They were unable to dodge or hide.</p>

  <p>As the Starry Roc-fish continued to close in on them, Geoffrey was suddenly struck with an idea. He grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff and put it into Ziya's hand before he exclaimed, "Use this to let it hide us! Hurry up, we don't have much time!"</p>

  <p>Ziya's powerful ability might have been insufficient when trying to dispose of the Starry Roc-fish. However, making use of a small hiding method seemed to be not that difficult.</p>

  <p>Ziya was surprisingly quick to react. He had seen how Geoffrey used the Heavenly Ring Staff before. Therefore he encountered no difficulty in wielding it. After taking it, he raised the Heavenly Rising Staff and yelled out, "Hide us!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he voiced his command, Ziya felt the energy from his inner world gush out uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>When a small-scale hiding technique was put to use, his inner world went through dramatic changes as almost half of the energy was drained from it.</p>

  <p>But the effect was surprisingly effective!</p>

  <p>A faint net of light veiled their bodies and suppressed their auras as though they were never there.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were hidden from the naked eye, the Starry Roc-fish flew over from afar till it reached where they stood.</p>

  <p>"Woo...</p>

  <p>Goo..."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish lowered its head to try to get a whiff of their auras but failed at its attempt. After searching unsuccessfully for a while, it moved on to the next holy pillar.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, we must hurry and head to the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It will be bad if that fish reaches my father before us," Geoffrey said, relaying his concerns to Ziya.</p>

  <p>The two of them didn't resort to flying in fear of the Starry Roc-fish locating them. They could only climb along the extended chain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they were able to move quickly along the chain.</p>
