<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3339 The Graveyard </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The divine land itself was extremely huge and had taken Chiyou a lot of effort and time to build.</p>

  <p>The tombstone was about the same size as the divine land, a fact that shocked Timotheus greatly.</p>

  <p>He thought back to a rumor.</p>

  <p>The chaos was vast and empty but many secrets and forbidden areas lay hidden within it. Those who entered dangerous sections of it, like the Ruin Graveyard, had no chance of returning.</p>

  <p>Rumor had it that if you saw a huge tombstone, it meant that you had stepped into the Ruin Graveyard and there would be no way back.</p>

  <p>Timotheus never believed in rumors like this. He only believed what he saw.</p>

  <p>But now that he was looking at this huge tombstone, he was finally on high alert.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands around, causing his body to spin 180 degrees to his right.</p>

  <p>The fast-moving divine land turned abruptly and sped on towards the other side.</p>

  <p>This time, Timotheus did not drive the ship into the chaos cloud because he couldn't see properly up there. He had to make sure he stayed away from the tombstone.</p>

  <p>He had controlled the divine land to fly for a while along the cloud when the sight of the tombstone looming in front of him again caused him to pale.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>A sense of foreboding rose from the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>Once he had accepted the captain's position, the entirety of the divine land had come under his control.</p>

  <p>He would be in big trouble if he entered the Ruin Graveyard. How would he ever face Grand Chieftain Chiyou if the divine land were to fall to ruin?</p>

  <p>Timotheus decided to change direction. He drove the ship to fly straight up.</p>

  <p>But it was not long before the same thing happened. The huge tombstone was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"We can't go out."</p>

  <p>Timotheus muttered, gritting his teeth. He drove the ship in the direction of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>He passed by it and the moment he did, he saw another huge tombstone up ahead.</p>

  <p>These tombstones, each of which was the same size as the divine land, were everywhere. But they looked dilapidated, as if they had been here in storage for tens of millions of years and had already turned into ruins.</p>

  <p>"So the rumor about the Ruin Graveyard is true!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus had flown for a while before he realized that he couldn't go on anymore. So he decided to discuss the situation with his group.</p>

  <p>He retreated from the rings, took the Sun-resisting Umbrella, and emerged from the sun. He then used the Grand Teleportation to head for the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The largest Floating Island in the center of the Time Sea was magnificently scenic, but despite all of it, the atmosphere in the hall seemed stiff and solemn.</p>

  <p>Many Holy Beings were gathered in the hall where Lorena sat on the throne, Rosie standing behind her.</p>

  <p>Mike stood in the middle of the hall, his brows furrowed as he asked Timotheus, "Is it true?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded and said, "That place is quite famous in the Source World. Almost everyone who has explored the chaos has heard about it. It is not just a baseless rumor."</p>

  <p>"Then the divine land will be ruined, won't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is the only place where we can live in!"</p>

  <p>"What makes that place so dangerous?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were whispering among themselves.</p>

  <p>Their worry stemmed from the fact that all of them were in the same boat.</p>

  <p>All of them lived here and shared lives and deaths with each other.</p>

  <p>"Timotheus," Rosie called out loudly over the whispers. "You said that whoever sees the tombstones can't find a way out. Then who gave the Ruin Graveyard its name? The person who named it must have been there. How did this person return to the Source World?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus folded his hands and bowed to Rosie. "That's why I don't believe in the rumor. Maybe we can find the way out. Maybe we can go back. But you will have to make a decision for us."</p>

  <p>Timotheus was the smartest, most far-sighted person in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Whenever he didn't know what to do, he asked Lorena and her sister for their opinion. After all, they were the direct descendants of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Lorena and Mike looked at each other. Mike then suggested, "How about we send some people out of the divine land to investigate it?"</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy was terrifying, but there were many people, including the Holy Beings and the masters at the Other Shore Realm who could travel through it.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea," Ramzi agreed.</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded. "I'll stop the divine land right away and then go make an investigation."</p>

  <p>"Timotheus, you should stay in the divine land. We'll take responsibility for the exploration," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Given that the divine land was still weak when compared to the strong beings of the chaos, Mike's suggestion was reasonable. They couldn't afford to put Timotheus in danger.</p>

  <p>"But..." Lorena hesitated. She didn't want to risk Mike's life.</p>

  <p>Mike laughed and said, "It's not a big deal for us to die outside since we have Rebirth Lands of our own. I will lead a team for the exploration."</p>

  <p>Lorena was aware that the Rebirth Land wasn't the best option. But she had no choice but to agree in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>It was not long before many Holy Beings, including Mike, Holy Jay, Estelle, and Sword Chen, went out of the divine land. Ramzi was the only Nine Li Guard who went with them.</p>

  <p>They approached the outer wall of the divine land and stood at it, taking in the horizon. Their eyes widened as they saw the huge tombstone.</p>

  <p>"The tombstone is so huge. I wonder who is buried underneath?" a Holy Being exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There is no tomb, just the tombstone. This place is strange," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Ramzi stared at the tombstone before cautiously saying, "There are many inconceivable things in the chaos. We must be more careful."</p>

  <p>"Everyone, follow me," said Mike as he leapt up and traveled through the chaos.</p>

  <p>The others followed him closely.</p>

  <p>Though it seemed the divine land stopped not far from a tombstone, it would still take a lot of time for a Holy Being to reach it.</p>

  <p>A day and a half later, the Holy Beings finally arrived at the tombstone.</p>

  <p>The dark tombstone floated in the air. This lonely, lifeless object emitted a strange aura, and its huge shape exerted an inexplicably great pressure on the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>One side of the tombstone was covered with cracks, each as deep as an abyss.</p>

  <p>One of the Holy Beings approached a crack.</p>

  <p>The moment he got close, a huge tongue stretched out from within the crack.</p>

  <p>A number of hooks jutted out of the surface of the tongue, each glinting dangerously.</p>

  <p>The tongue caught the Holy Being, the hooks piercing his body as it sucked him into the crack of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that a sudden vibration rocked the divine land. A universe had just collapsed.</p>
