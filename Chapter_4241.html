<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been a while since Geoffrey had left the Deleting Space. He only used the human language when he talked to Ziya.</p>

  <p>That was why he was stunned when he heard the familiar language.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me?" he said, still reeling from the shock.</p>

  <p>The man of the Elemental race smiled. "I asked if you were looking for me."</p>

  <p>"So you... you are Elder Xue?" Geoffrey asked, finally coming back to his senses.</p>

  <p>The man of the Elemental race nodded in confirmation, peering at Geoffrey with continued interest.</p>

  <p>He had never thought that someone from the main world would come looking for him.</p>

  <p>He had initially thought that only the members of the Four Spirits Sect would have access to the Deep Space. But all of them could not return to the main world, not to mention the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue knew that there were humans in the chaos. But as far as he knew, they had difficulty surviving the main world. Entering the Deep Space was a different ball game altogether.</p>

  <p>So when he came to know of an outsider wanting to meet him, he became as excited as Geoffrey was.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, what happened to you? How did you end up like this?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue sighed and said, his voice deep and pained. "I did all this for survival."</p>

  <p>As a creature of the fourth-grade world, it was beyond difficult for Elder Xue to survive in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>He had been through a lot in order to keep himself alive in this mysterious and foreign place.</p>

  <p>First of all, he had to get used to life in the fifth-grade world, for everything here was different from the fourth-grade world.</p>

  <p>"I spent a long time here before I got the chance to possess a man of the Elemental race. It was because of this that I was able to live," Elder Xue said. But a sudden thought occurred to him. "Are you from the chaos?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded in affirmation.</p>

  <p>"Have you met..." Elder Xue's words petered out.</p>

  <p>The only member of the human race that Elder Xue knew from the chaos was the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>'I bet he knows the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. He wouldn't have been able to get here otherwise, ' Elder Xue thought.</p>

  <p>"I've seen Kincaid," Geoffrey answered the unasked question.</p>

  <p>"What?" Elder Xue exclaimed, but his voice soon began to tremble. "Did Master Kincaid wake up?" he asked again, excitement dripping off of him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has awakened," Geoffrey responded, nodding.</p>

  <p>He knew Kincaid's true identity and had seen him through the Other Shore Token. He didn't think Kincaid was a great person and that Kincaid was more powerful than his father. That was why he didn't get why Elder Xue was so excited.</p>

  <p>"How did he wake up?" Elder Xue pressed on.</p>

  <p>"He was awakened by my father," Geoffrey answered with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Who is your father?" Elder Xue asked.</p>

  <p>"My father is  Zheng Luo." Geoffrey's voice dripped pride.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue was not interested in humans, which was why he had never heard about Zheng. He waved dismissively and said, "I've never heard of this person."</p>

  <p>His reply upset Geoffrey. "Kincaid asked me to deliver a message to you.</p>

  <p>My father absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline, but lost the sword.</p>

  <p>Kincaid has asked you to look for an item that contains power from the Deep Space and that only my father can master," Geoffrey said.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue stood up abruptly at this, his black tail shivering.</p>

  <p>"Your father managed to absorb the ancestry-level bloodline?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did!" Geoffrey confirmed proudly.</p>

  <p>He was glad to see Elder Xue's reaction. After all, Zheng was his role model, someone he looked up to.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue walked back and forth, his heart beating faster with every step he took.</p>

  <p>'He made it!</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had also succeeded!'</p>

  <p>But he was soon lost in thought yet again.</p>

  <p>After a long while, he asked, "Who taught you to walk normally in the main world and the Deep Space?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe these powers come naturally to me," Geoffrey replied, shrugging again.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey couldn't answer this question, and neither could Ziya or Zheng.</p>

  <p>That was why Geoffrey considered it to be his talent.</p>

  <p>"Did your father cultivate Grand Weapon Refining Method before your birth?" Elder Xue asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Geoffrey replied.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue looked relieved at this. He smiled and said, "Your father is indeed amazing. But you have been able to reach this place only because of me."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking?" Geoffrey snapped. . 'Such a shameless old man! Taking credit for something he hasn't even done!' he thought angrily.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue wasn't angry. He used to be famous for his good temper in the Bold Conjecture House. "Yes. Your father was able to get the Grand Weapon Refining Method and managed to absorb the ancestry-level bloodline because of me. You can travel through different worlds because your father has a special physique. So, technically speaking, you were able to get here because of me. Is that clear enough?" Elder Xue explained patiently.</p>

  <p>His words took Geoffrey by surprise. "My father learned the Grand Weapon Refining Method from you!" he said wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"No, no. That's not what I meant. I gave it to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord through a certain method," Elder Xue said.</p>

  <p>"I see!" Geoffrey nodded.</p>

  <p>"You said that your father lost that sword. How did that happen?" Elder Xue asked again.</p>

  <p>Kincaid had explained everything that had happened in the chaos to Geoffrey in detail. Geoffrey hadn't understood what he had said but he filled Elder Xue in on what he was told without missing any details.</p>

  <p>When he heard that the humanoid creature had gotten his hands on that sword, Elder Xue's eyebrows furrowed, a troubled expression taking its place on his face.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Deep Space for a long time, and had uncovered all the secrets of the Deep Space that the people of the Four Spirits Sect had failed to figure out. That was how he was aware of the terrible thing that would happen since the humanoid creature had now obtained that sword.</p>

  <p>"Kincaid told me that the most important thing is to get the other item. Do you know what he was talking about, Elder Xue?" Geoffrey asked. .</p>

  <p>Elder Xue walked past Geoffrey and approached the entrance of the oval-shaped building. "The thing that Master Kincaid asked you to look for is over there. I have been thinking about how to get it all these years," Elder Xue said, pointing at the huge chimney in the distance.</p>

  <p>"You've been here for so long and you haven't got your hands on it?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey said, his lips pursing in disapproval.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue didn't know how to respond to this question. He shook his head helplessly and said, "Anyone who gets that item would be able to rule the Deep Space. Do you think it would be easy to acquire it? Look at this place." He pointed at the several oval-shaped buildings in the distance.</p>

  <p>"There are also members of other races of the Deep Space in these buildings. They arrived here with the same purpose as us and that is to obtain that thing. For countless years, the six races of the Deep Space sent countless people here. None of them made it out of there alive," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Stop bluffing. It's not that difficult. Those people died there just because they were not intelligent enough. Send me in. I can make it," Geoffrey said confidently, a tinge of arrogance lacing his tone.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue stared at Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>'What a cocky guy!</p>

  <p>He has no idea what he is up against.'</p>

  <p>But it suddenly occurred to Elder Xue that Geoffrey was different from others.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he can do it. Is this fate?</p>

  <p>I gave his father the Grand Weapon Refining Method although we were in different worlds back then, and now he is here, right before my eyes.'</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Elder Xue said calmly. "You can give it a shot. But if you fail, you will meet your death."</p>
