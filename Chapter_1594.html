  <p>
</p>

  <p>Damon, standing across the deep ravine, was constantly provoking Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>However, from inside the fog there was nothing but silence.</p>

  <p>After a long while, a voice finally sounded with a ghostly echo from within the mist.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!"</p>

  <p>When Damon heard this voice, he was momentarily stunned before a furious look appeared on his face. "You dare to scold me?"</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" yet another voice said in an almost bored tone.</p>

  <p>"You're the idiot!" Damon roared, his voice echoing throughout the spacious hall.</p>

  <p>"Liar! Didn't you say that you won't fight back or return curses? I only scolded you twice, and already you swore in return. How can I then believe your words?" Zheng's voice retorted from within the mist.</p>

  <p>"I...I..." Damon was startled, and his words stalled in his throat at hearing the rebuke. He had been trying to provoke his enemies, but now he was the one who became infuriated due to Zheng's words instead. He didn't know how to respond now.</p>

  <p>"Damon, don't concern yourself with them. They won't be able to last long." Lone's voice floated over from the darkness.</p>

  <p>Damon suddenly nodded, took heart and said, "You are right! Let's see how long these guys can endure!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Janet, who was in the fog, laughed as she looked at Luo Zheng, who was standing beside her. "I didn't know that you are also just as good at verbal quarreling as at actual fighting."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and smiled. Right at that moment, his left hand shot out like a lightning bolt and grabbed Janet, retreating a step to the right. In the blink of an eye, a hook shot out across the deep ravine and flew straight towards Janet.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Zheng's swift reflexes, Janet was able to escape being caught!</p>

  <p>"That was close!" Janet got so frightened that she stood out in a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>If she had been caught by the hook, she would definitely have been killed by the ten opponents. Even if Luo Zheng and the others were then still able to pass through this Hall of Causality, the next part of this saga would have no mention of her.</p>

  <p>"There's someone on the other side who has the ability to see through my fog. I don't know whether this is due to the sounds in the mist or something else," Jeffrey said with a grave expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Just like Zheng's magical eyes were able to see through some of the Dark Laws, some of the warriors on the other side seemed in turn able to see through the Illusive Fog as well!</p>

  <p>"I... I can kill them using this," said Hailey, who had been silent all this time, as she gently lifted the Moon Bursting Flame Bow in her hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly at this moment. "Don't bother. I'll deal with this ogre.</p>

  <p>However, they will definitely have other tricks up their sleeves. We'd better stand further apart."</p>

  <p>After passing through the second Hall of Causality, Luo Zheng had become their unofficial leader.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had spoken, he must then have the confidence to do as he pledged. Therefore, no one had any objections.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng's figure flashed, and he appeared in the middle of the fog. His eyes fixed on the ogre across the deep ravine. His left hand grasped the long chain affixed at the end of the hook, and his right hand suddenly hurled the hook towards that ogre.</p>

  <p>Because Jeffrey had summoned the fog, both sides were in a stalemate.</p>

  <p>Now that their impasse was about to be broken, everyone had naturally reached a state of high tension!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The long hook drew a bright silver arc through the air, heading straight for the ogre!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng saw a cunning smile spread on the ogre's face.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's expression was incomparably calm. No matter what ability the ogre possessed, Luo Zheng could still instantly kill him!</p>

  <p>The speed of this hook was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it crossed the three-thousand-feet gap and attached to the ogre. With a light tug from Luo Zheng, the ogre was pulled over by him!</p>

  <p>In principle, the hooks in this Hall of Causality were special treasures that belonged to the Illusion Battlefield. It was similar to the Teleportation Token in Zheng's hands. The rules contained within the hooks were nearly unbreakable and warriors were powerless to act against these irresistible laws.</p>

  <p>This hook wouldn't cause any harm to a martial artist, but at the same time, no one could break free from it either. The moment that the ogre was hooked, his burly body had almost no weight and was immediately reeled in by Luo Zheng like a fish on a line.</p>

  <p>"Huff�"</p>

  <p>As the ogre was pulled towards Luo Zheng, he simultaneously let out a wild and mocking laugh. At the same time, his body suddenly erupted with wild and violent forceful energy!</p>

  <p>A body refiner's forceful energy would usually erupt within the body of a martial artist. Because the forceful energy couldn't be used to visualize things like life vitality, there was no need to channel forceful energy out of one's body to use it.</p>

  <p>However, when this ogre named Damon roared aloud as soon as he was pulled over, the forceful energy within his body instantly transformed into diamond-shaped crystals that covered the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>"Forceful Crystal Armor!"</p>

  <p>This skill came from Supreme Lord Mathias' Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that the risk of being caught by their enemies was very high. The warriors who entered the Halls of Causality were all ruthless figures of the Illusion Battlefield, and had all established reputations for being resourceful and not to be trifled with. These warriors all featured at the top of the food chain in the main cities, and they were almost invincible.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Damon had the utmost confidence in his Forceful Crystal Armor!</p>

  <p>After condensing the forceful energy into the Forceful Crystal Armor, even the warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm and Spirit Transformation Realm wouldn't be able to break through his defense in a short period of time. Soul Sea Realm warriors didn't stand a chance of even fracturing the powerful armor. Damon would have plenty of time to throw the hook backwards, and as long as he could hook Lone over with him, this bunch of cowards, who hid in the mist, would reach the end of their path in the Halls of Causality.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had condensed the Forceful Crystal Armor, he wanted to throw his hook towards the back. As for any attacks from his enemies, his Forceful Crystal Armor would deal with them and protect him.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Luo Zheng didn't make a move; instead, he only smiled.</p>

  <p>Damon also noticed Zheng's smile, but he failed to read anything into it.</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng's smile appeared, another long hook flew out from behind Luo Zheng and sucked Damon in, pulling him off his feet yet again!</p>

  <p>"Whap!"</p>

  <p>The moment the second long hook wrapped around Damon, his Forceful Crystal Armor was destroyed by the rules of the heavens contained within the long hook. Not far away, Jeffrey was clutching the long hook, while he stared indifferently at Damon. It was as if he was looking at an idiot.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Hall of Causality, a martial artist who was caught by the long hook was unable to break free and became powerless to fight back. The Forceful Crystal Armor possessed an extremely strong defensive power, but no matter its strength, it still couldn't overcome the rules of the Hall of Causality!</p>

  <p>Originally, Luo Zheng had intended to immediately push this ogre into the deep ditch. It was likely that no one would be able to resist the colorful energy river inside it. Even if Luo Zheng were to fall into it, he too would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>However, his original plan still had some risks.</p>

  <p>As always, he was extremely confident in his own strength. It was likely that very few in his generation would be able to match him in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>However, with so many geniuses in the Illusion Battlefield, and given the confidence of this ogre, Luo Zheng had to come up with a more secure method of overcoming their enemy.</p>

  <p>The Laws of Causality in the Halls of Causality were often filled with hidden murderous intent. If someone violated the laws, they would be killed. For example, the energy river in the trench and the square boulders in the second Hall of Causality were not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>But the mighty power of the Laws of Causality could be taken advantage of as well, if one was very clever.</p>

  <p>This long hook contained an extremely fierce Law of Causality. The martial artists that were hooked were placed in a special state. In this state, the martial artists had no weight and couldn't fight back. They also couldn't use life vitality or forceful energy, nor could they be harmed while attached to the hook!</p>

  <p>Only once they were released from the hooks would the two sides be able to fight, and slay their enemies!</p>

  <p>Therefore, as soon as Damon condensed the Forceful Crystal Armor, Jeffrey, who had been hidden not too far away, immediately shot out his hook.</p>

  <p>The diamond-shaped crystal that Damon had consumed lots of his forceful energy to condense was naturally broken by the heavens' rules contained in the hook!</p>

  <p>As for Jeffrey, he hooked Damon over to his side and quickly retreated out of reach. He did not dare to confront Damon directly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Damon's face revealed a trace of panic! The Forceful Crystal Armor that he had spent a large amount of his forceful energy to condense was instantly broken by a small hook, just like that! This was the strongest Transcendent Divine Might his father had ever mastered, but it was destroyed by a mere hook.</p>

  <p>"Forceful Crystal Armor!"</p>

  <p>Damon reacted extremely fast. He did not attack Jeffrey, but instead he focused and condensed his Forceful Crystal Armor once again. At the same time, he threw the hook in his hand! The most important thing for him was to hook Lone over so that he might have reinforcements!</p>

  <p>"Swish�"</p>

  <p>But this time, Janet, who was standing even further away, cast out her hook.</p>

  <p>Damon's Forceful Crystal Armor was just formed, while it was also broken by Janet's deftly thrown long hook. At the same time, it wrapped around Damon's burly body and he was again knocked down and pulled towards Janet.</p>

  <p>It was like they were playing a little game of tug-of-war with him. One warrior after another dragged Damon along. There was not a single stop between them. The instant he was released by Janet's long hook, another hook wrapped around him once again. As for Damon's Forceful Crystal Armor, it was constantly being condensed, and also swiftly crushed by the heavens' rules contained in the long hooks. Damon never received the chance to throw his own hook back at Lone!</p>
