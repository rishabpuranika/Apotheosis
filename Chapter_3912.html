<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3912 The Second Truth </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The marks of Eight Diagrams appeared one after another under the Grandmaster of Heaven's feet while he dodged the palm prints that kept descending from the sky.</p>

  <p>The ground behind him was densely packed with palm prints, which formed a wide ditch.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The moment he avoided another one palm print, he became shocked when he saw the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>His spiritual sense always covered an area with a radius of over a hundred million miles. He saw that the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gerald, and Herbert were fast approaching!</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi."</p>

  <p>Although it was his first time to descend into the chaos, the Black Ship was always the one that gathered the information from the Source World then sent it to him before.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had defeated Emperor Di Jun easily.</p>

  <p>He also knew that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gotten trapped in Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>It must be the case that someone had taken over his physical body, which greatly enhanced his strength.</p>

  <p>The truth behind it might be a puzzle for others, but the Grandmaster of Heaven easily figured out what had happened.</p>

  <p>Now, Fuxi had become much more powerful, and perhaps the Snake Goddess's strength had also increased. They might have let the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess take over their bodies.</p>

  <p>Since the Grandmaster of Heaven faced them alone, the pressure he felt naturally increased.</p>

  <p>Had it been someone else, they probably would've run away by now. He could at least join the two Chaos Ancient Gods who were in the Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>Yet, he didn't choose to escape.</p>

  <p>Instead of continuing to dodge the palm prints of Eight Diagrams, he suddenly stopped in midair!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Fuxi continued to slap the ground in the Li Shan mountain, but the palm prints went through the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was like a ghost in the air, and he avoided all his attacks.</p>

  <p>That was the ability of the Chaos Ancient God Othniel? the Void Illusory World, which could create a unique separate space for him to stay.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven, long time no see!" the bright-eyed Snake Goddess exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Because it was the real Snake Goddess, she spoke in an unusually confident manner.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, it's just as I thought. Even if you have a complete body to use, you still can't bring your full strength into play," the Grandmaster of Heaven coldly shot back.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Snake Goddess spread her fingers and gently lifted them.</p>

  <p>In turn, crimson energy filaments burst out from her snow-white skin.</p>

  <p>The energy filaments constantly whirled and changed, then finally turned into a gigantic shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Usually, after the Snake Goddess activated her Wild God Body, her body would grow as high as eight million feet, while her shadow reached up to ten million feet high!</p>

  <p>This time, however, her shadow extended up to a hundred million feet high.</p>

  <p>It covered the sky and the sun, and contained endless energy!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, Gerald, and Judson looked very small in front of the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"It should be enough to kill you," the Snake Goddess said seriously.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, her large shadow slammed down the Grandmaster of Heaven's head.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The Void Illusory World was completely independent from the outside space. Although the shadow of Snake Goddess was powerful, it didn't harm the Grandmaster of Heaven at all.</p>

  <p>Still, she was in no way discouraged. The energy beams on the shadow's hands continuously entangled with the Grandmaster of Heaven until they completely wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>"It's useless," the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered.</p>

  <p>"Really? The Void Illusory World may not be invincible as you think!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Gerald, who was at the side, released powerful life energy.</p>

  <p>Numerous silkworms with wings came out of the dark green fog, and each of them had a pair of sharp teeth that glowed blue on their heads.</p>

  <p>They were the World-devouring Silkworms, a kind of creature Gerald had created.</p>

  <p>He knew that he would fight against the other Chaos Ancient Gods one day, so he was naturally prepared.</p>

  <p>He created the World-devouring Silkworms to deal with Othniel, but he did not expect that the Grandmaster of Heaven had Othniel's ability. Thus, they came handy at the moment.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The World-devouring Silkworms flapped their wings and flew towards the Grandmaster of Heaven. The sharp teeth on their heads clattered and devoured the space bit by bit. The task looked as easy as eating leaves to them.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't know that Gerald had such a power.</p>

  <p>When he saw the World-devouring Silkworms move forward to devour him, he had no choice but to get out of the Void Illusory World.</p>

  <p>Just as he came out, however, the Snake Goddess's energy beams were already there to bind him!</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>Crimson energy beams quickly corroded his body!</p>

  <p>Even the body of a warrior at the Eternal Realm could not endure the erosion from the shadow of Snake Goddess. At that point, the Grandmaster of Heaven's skin became charred.</p>

  <p>However, it only lasted for quite a short period.</p>

  <p>A strong force of life truth suddenly emerged from the Grandmaster of Heaven's body. A green mist rolled out, and not only did it repair his body, but it also left a thick layer of tissue on his skin.</p>

  <p>The mist formed the layer of tissue, especially to deal with the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>As a result, the erosion caused by the shadow of Snake Goddess wouldn't be as strong.</p>

  <p>"Life truth?</p>

  <p>He can also use the life truth!</p>

  <p>How did he make it?" Gerald said in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a big deal that the Grandmaster of Heaven used Othniel's token, as perhaps Othniel had made an exchange with him.</p>

  <p>The big deal was that the Grandmaster of Heaven also exhibited the life truth, which was puzzling.</p>

  <p>But now they were in a battle, so Gerald didn't have the time to think about it.</p>

  <p>When he saw that the Grandmaster of Heaven was about to forcefully come out of shadow of Snake Goddess, his body suddenly slipped, and his large tail stabbed the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Poison of Decomposition at the end of his tail was incurable. Someone as powerful as Claire still died after she was poisoned, and the Grandmaster of Heaven was no exception.</p>

  <p>But of course, the Grandmaster of Heaven knew Gerald better than Claire did.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had decided to pay particular attention to Gerald's movements. As soon as he saw the needle stab towards him, he turned over and quickly avoided it.</p>

  <p>The second he dodged the tail, a golden sword shadow fell straight towards him.</p>

  <p>Without even looking at it, the Grandmaster of Heaven held the Cyan Misty Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>The huge swords clashed against each other, and the sword radiance danced in all directions.</p>

  <p>Every collision was powerfully destructive. If the creatures in the Victory Province looked up, the dazzling golden light would blind their eyes.</p>

  <p>After the Grandmaster of Heaven and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had exchanged dozens of sword strikes in an instant, the Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly stepped into the void. His big body was like a ghost as he flew south, which was the location of the Taoism Province. His goal was to get the other two Chaos Ancient Gods who were in the Taoism Province involved.</p>

  <p>"Go after him!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the Snake Goddess, Gerald, and the others followed him closely.</p>

  <p>At first, Othniel and Herbert, who were in the Taoism Province, were still panicking when they faced Fuxi's attack.</p>

  <p>However, the attacks of the Eight Diagrams and the palm prints came a little delayed as they reached the Taoism Province. Furthermore, it wasn't hard to avoid them with their abilities.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the two Chaos Ancient Gods also noticed that the Li Shan mountain took the initiative to attack the Grandmaster of Heaven!</p>

  <p>Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were not on the same side. In reality, Othniel was afraid of the Grandmaster of Heaven when it came to strength. Since the Li Shan mountain had exhibited powerful capabilities, it would be a good thing for them if they took the opportunity to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>After all, the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake didn't require Othniel to help the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>It turned out that all this time, the two Chaos Ancient Gods chose to standby and not interfere. What they didn't expect was that the Grandmaster of Heaven evaded the attacks launched by the people of Li Shan mountain, then charged straight towards them.</p>
