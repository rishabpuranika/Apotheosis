<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Water suddenly gushed out and filled the surroundings of the palace.</p>

  <p>The temperature gradually reached an extremely low point but the water continuously flowed without being frozen.</p>

  <p>However, as the water eventually made contact with Zheng, a sudden unimaginable chill seeped into the deepest parts of his soul. He instantly lost focus and was flabbergasted by the uncontrollable piercing sensation brought about by the cold water.</p>

  <p>"It's so cold..." Every part of his body was already trembling.</p>

  <p>The water rose quickly, almost submerging four-fifths of their bodies.</p>

  <p>Gonggong then said to Zheng, "If you're able to hold on for five minutes, you pass. If not, then you fail."</p>

  <p>Soon, the rising water filled the whole palace, fully submerging both Zheng and Gonggong.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body heat quickly dissipated and his entire body grew stiff. It was a very dangerous situation as he couldn't even move an inch.</p>

  <p>'I can't take this anymore...'</p>

  <p>Previously, during the test by Zhurong, the God of Fire, Zheng easily aced it as his body couldn't be harmed by fire. However, as he faced Gonggong, his weakness was exposed as he had so much difficulty in dealing with the low temperature that was overwhelming his body.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Under the supreme pressure brought about by the numbing cold water, cracks began to appear on the surface of Zheng's body. His flesh was gradually being torn apart.</p>

  <p>What scared him more was that as his body started to rip, he didn't feel any pain.</p>

  <p>'How did all my strength leave my body? Is it because of the very low temperature?' Zheng thought as his mind went hazier by the minute.</p>

  <p>When his body started to crack, even the Chaotic Source Spirits couldn't be activated. This was the first time that Zheng had experienced being subjected to such a low temperature.</p>

  <p>'I need heat to restore my strength!'</p>

  <p>He remembered that energy could bring heat into one's body as it swirled inside.</p>

  <p>In the moment of desperation, Zheng madly extracted a lot of divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>As the force surged through his body, his stiff bones and muscles gradually recovered. Heat quickly gathered and spread throughout his body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Gonggong was looking at Zheng indifferently from a distance. He was quite disappointed with his performance.</p>

  <p>'He should have been smarter than this and done something right away when he came into contact with the cold water. Now it might be too late for him.'</p>

  <p>Zheng had been frozen for a while and Gonggong thought that it might be impossible for him to counter the situation.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the palace, Zheng was standing still like a frozen figure.</p>

  <p>From the outside, it seemed like he was already finished as he was unable to do anything to get rid of the cold water.</p>

  <p>However, inside his body, many divine megatons of force was furiously circulating.</p>

  <p>The faster it moved, the more heat and energy it accumulated.</p>

  <p>Just when Gonggong deemed that Zheng had miserably failed the test, Zheng's fingers suddenly shook. His arms also began to move, followed by his shoulder, torso, and legs.</p>

  <p>"Oh? This guy..." Gonggong's eyes narrowed as the scene developed in front of him.</p>

  <p>As Zheng gradually recovered and unfroze his stiff body, his movements became more natural. The ice-cold water in the palace began swirling around him.</p>

  <p>The water rotated frantically as the temperature increased gradually. In a matter of seconds, the once ice-cold water that filled the palace became lukewarm.</p>

  <p>As Gonggong became satisfied with Zheng's performance, he gently waved his hand. The abundant water quickly rescinded and flowed away until there was none left.</p>

  <p>What was left was Zheng's figure enveloped by a thick mist. It turned out that due to Zheng's high body temperature, the cold water nearest to his body vaporized into this mist.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly stepped out from the mist and said, "Can I leave now?" He was proud of his achievement but still managed to show utmost respect as he bowed to Gonggong.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on his face, Gonggong didn't say anything but pointed his finger at the door, signaling Zheng that he could now leave.</p>

  <p>This region of stars that Gonggong was in charge of was called Water Region. It occupied many stars, about the same size as the Fire Region under Zhurong's jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>'The Water Region and Fire Region should be comparable to a super force in the Source World. It also means that the strength and status of Gonggong and Zhurong must be about equal to the Snake Goddess' and Eastern Emperor Taiyi's. However, those two have been on the Other Shore for countless years. I wonder how strong they really are now...'</p>

  <p>Zheng was immersed in these thoughts as he flew through the stars.</p>

  <p>As he continued traversing across the starry sky, he knew he had to pass the tests of thirty-nine heroes.</p>

  <p>'It seems like I don't have a choice but to accept all of their challenges. I'm not actually against it. Actually, it would be such a great honor if I could meet them all in person. It's just that...'</p>

  <p>Zheng realized a great problem that was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Facing all the heroes generally meant that he would have to face the real Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, and so on.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess in the Source World could be considered as another persona that was created purposely. They were both the Snake Goddess but were different at the same time. Zheng understood the concept but still felt a little strange.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As Zheng dashed at top speed, the surrounding stars changed in appearance yet again.</p>

  <p>Bright golden stars began swarming towards him one after another.</p>

  <p>When he landed, he saw golden Buddha statues all over the place. Each golden Buddha statue had a different shape and appearance. Some were standing while some were lying on the ground. There were myriads of statues in various postures.</p>

  <p>In fact, wherever one's eyes went on this golden planet, it was still covered by Buddha statues.</p>

  <p>"So this must be the Buddha Region…" Zheng narrowed his eyes as he scanned the entire area that was beaming in golden lights.</p>

  <p>In his father's universe, Buddhism was inherited and practiced in some portions. However, upon reaching the divine land, there wasn't a single trace of Buddhism. It disappeared from the Source World as well.</p>

  <p>There was actually an explanation regarding that.</p>

  <p>The civilization of the 77th chaos shouldn't have appeared in this particular round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were seeds that were planted purposely.</p>

  <p>Likewise, Buddhism might have been spread, but for some reason, it hadn't developed.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had read through the ancient books in the Source World, he also found out the origin of Zhurong, the God of Fire. He discovered that he belonged to a human force that had fought with the Sky Rending Rhinoceros before. But since the said force didn't develop, they also disappeared in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>A loud and melodious bell rang out in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a ray of golden light bloomed out before Zheng as a huge Buddha statue appeared from the blinding lights.</p>

  <p>His hands took the mudra of teaching. Then he looked at Zheng with an amiable gaze.</p>

  <p>Just when Zheng was about to speak, the Buddha suddenly closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng felt that his chest became unusually heavy. His eyes were also forced to close. Everything turned dark and inaudible.</p>

  <p>However, for Zheng, whose six senses were sealed, did not fall into the darkness.</p>

  <p>In his innermost being, the golden light bloomed once again. He faced the Buddha with his consciousness. He saw that the Buddha was still staring at him with the mudra of teaching. With this, his innermost being was also sealed and he sank to the innermost being of his innermost being.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to face the Buddha again using the innermost being of his innermost being, the same thing happened that forced him into the third layer of his innermost being.</p>

  <p>As Zheng kept on being sealed repeatedly, he had lost count of which layer of his innermost being he had reached.</p>

  <p>He only felt that the change of time was extremely slow, and every time that he would open his eyes, he could always see the calm face of the golden Buddha.</p>
