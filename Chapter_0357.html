<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 357 The Demonic Phantom (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After the constant practicing of Zheng, the demonic life vitality became darker as the purple color mixed in it gradually faded away. The tiny starlight embedded in it became more lustrous and brilliant.</p>

  <p>Inside Zheng's body, there were six streaks of life vitality flowing out.</p>

  <p>Under his control, this life vitality would form a silhouette of Zheng, but a smaller version. This was the form of the demonic phantom.</p>

  <p>Zheng glued his eyes on the phantoms, pointed his fingers at them and uttered lightly, "Rise up!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, the six demonic phantoms started flying in the room. As the demonic phantom itself originated from life vitality, it was weightless. Thus, it could fly briskly and fast. Moreover, the six of them flying around would make the best defense from enemy attack.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, he could only summon up to six demonic phantoms. However, according to the records from "Heavenly Ogre Fist", with much practice, those with strong psychic force could summon up hundreds of demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>Each demonic phantom could absorb the enemy's life vitality to strengthen its own–a special attribute of demonic life vitality. Once the demonic phantoms matured, their powers would be more terrifying.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…"</p>

  <p>"Bang…." Something was flying crazily and crashing onto something. It just happened with a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>It was one of Zheng's demonic phantoms. Due to Zheng's relatively weak power, it slipped out of his control, crashed directly into the wall of his practice room and then penetrated through another two walls of the house, leading to the collapse of the half outer wall of the house.</p>

  <p>The inner disciples' houses had a secret practicing room where they could conduct further studies and practice their own unique skills in their own time. The walls of these rooms were filled with heptyl gold–a kind of hard metal that isolated the soul snoop.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Zheng did not expect that the demonic phantom could be so powerful that it would directly crash through the hard walls made from heptyl gold.</p>

  <p>"What the fuck happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why did the walls collapse?"</p>

  <p>Other disciples were surprised to see what happened and didn't understand what caused the hard walls to collapse. Zheng's house was not far from the other inner disciples' houses; thus, they easily heard the loud noise, so they went to check out what happened.</p>

  <p>Zheng came out from the hole on the wall, wearing an awkward smile, and said apologetically, "I'm sorry! It's just a small accident while I was practicing."</p>

  <p>The damage on the outer wall of the house was no big deal as a few civilian craftsmen could repair it. However, when they saw that the wall of Zheng's secret room was also damaged, they could not help but gasp.</p>

  <p>They knew very well that the walls of the secret practicing room were made of heptyl gold and iron sand. It was supposed to be extremely solid to resist any impact, even one's whole might.</p>

  <p>What kind of cultivation was he practicing exactly?</p>

  <p>The onlooker inner disciples were all between five-grade to six-grade natural level. But even at a high-grade natural level, they couldn't be able to break the walls of the secret practicing room unless they had a high-grade weapon.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Zheng!" Just then, someone called out Zheng's name abruptly.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around and saw Cleve walking towards him. Since Zheng became an inner disciple of the Drizzle Peak, he concentrated on practice at the secret room every day, thus hardly had any time to meet Cleve.</p>

  <p>The last time they saw each other was when they fought demons together.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Cleve! Long time no see," Zheng greeted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Yeah! Anyway, I am here to deliver a message from our senior disciple, Yehudi. He asked you to come over his house to discuss the matters of All Peaks Competition," Cleve said, cutting through the chase. Cleve had also locked himself in his own secret practice room to cultivate, and it was just a few days ago when he completed his secret practice. The desire to improve his strength was stimulated by Zheng when they were both in a trial of killing demons.</p>

  <p>During his long practice, Cleve made another big improvement in his strength. But when he saw Zheng's strength jumped from half step to nature level into the grade-two natural level, he could not help but admire the progress that Zheng was making. Moreover, being sensitive to "sword intent", Cleve could also feel the strong spiritual aura that Zheng was emitting at present, even though the latter was just plainly looking at him.</p>

  <p>'Has he already grasped the sword intent?</p>

  <p>How did he do it?' Cleve's mind was racing wildly.</p>

  <p>He had seen Zheng's fighting technique and how the latter used to rely on his fists and his mysterious flying knife.</p>

  <p>'When did he learn to use a sword?</p>

  <p>And how could he have grasped the sword intent if he hadn't used a sword?' Cleve thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Cleve had been practicing swordplay for decades, but until now, he couldn't grasp the sword intent at all. Sword intent was something that could not be learned easily. It would just come out naturally and only those with a high power of understanding would be able to figure it out.</p>

  <p>'But for just a short period of time, Zheng has grasped it?' Cleve asked himself.</p>

  <p>Though Cleve found it hard to believe, the faintly discernible strong spiritual aura emitting from Zheng was undeniably sword intent.</p>

  <p>In front of many onlookers, Cleve couldn't bring himself to ask Zheng directly. Anyway, he would find out later once Zheng participated in the All Peaks Competition. At the Competition, Zheng would inevitably encounter strong enemies that would require him to show his sword intent, if he had already grasped it. But deep down, Cleve could not bear the thought that he might be right about Zheng. After all, the sword intent was not easy to acquire, at least for him since he still hadn't got it after many years of hard practice.</p>
