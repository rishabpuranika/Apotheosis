  <p>
</p>

  <p>Prior to this, everyone had been talking about Eddie's possible arrival at the Cloud Hall, so Cloud Hall and Cloudy City were both under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had hurriedly set up the Small Circulation Killing Array, but there had been no news of Eddie for a full three months, so, many people thought that he would not come.</p>

  <p>Although Cloud Hall had not let its guard down and the Small Circulation Killing Array was still operating day and night, many people had assumed he wouldn't come and had started to relax a bit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a house in Cloudy City, a one-year-old toddler was trying to take his first steps. He had just started walking cautiously when a terrifying might suddenly crashed outside. He plopped down on the ground and began to wail.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of people lived in this huge city. From the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm to little babies, their faces visibly stiffened as they felt the overwhelming force of the power.</p>

  <p>The master of a third-grade family sighed wearily, "Eddie is here."</p>

  <p>The warriors who knew what was happening simultaneously turned to look at Cloud Hall in the sky. A vast majority of the commoners had no idea what was happening but knew that it was the arrival of a demon, an omen of great maliciousness.</p>

  <p>Bells were hurriedly sounded in a few small temples in the city. Thousands of monks sat in the Buddhist hall, chanting the Rebirth Spell continuously.</p>

  <p>This was the strength of the strongest in the Central Region. With just his voice and his thoughts, he could control thousands of people. If he wanted and had the time, he could even take their lives without any fear of being surrounded by a malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>In these three months, Eddie had taken his son on a trip to the South Sea.</p>

  <p>Eddie could think of many ways to save Eden if he was just seriously injured. However, his dedication to martial arts had been destroyed, which was worrisome.</p>

  <p>However, there was a hidden sect in the South Sea that was well-versed in the special secret techniques about the soul and memories. They might be able to remove the obstacles Eden encountered.</p>

  <p>This trip to the South Sea had taken Eddie three whole months. The first thing he did upon returning to the Central Region was to rush to Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Eddie was a warrior with luck on his side. He had accidentally found an island on the trip to the South Sea to save his son, and unexpectedly took over the mantle of an ancient martial artist.</p>

  <p>He was lucky, but the people around him weren't. His son's dedication to martial arts had been destroyed by Luo Luo Zheng, and Marilyn had died tragically under Luo Zheng's sword. This was devastating to him.</p>

  <p>He had never suffered such a loss before.</p>

  <p>Not to mention Cloud Hall. Even if his enemy was the Ethereal Spirit Sect or the World Commercial Alliance, he would rebel against them.</p>

  <p>Looking down at Cloud Hall and seeing the huge enchanted barrier in front of him, Eddie shouted loudly, "Imogen, come out!"</p>

  <p>The door of a thatched cottage creaked open, and Imogen came out, expressionless. At her age, she was already detached from life and death, but she hated to part with Cloud Hall and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Inside the Ice Palace, Yudie's and Luo Zheng's expressions changed, and they, too, rushed out.</p>

  <p>Now everyone in Cloud Hall was panic-stricken. All the elders who were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm immediately rushed up to the sky. All of them knew they were facing a great enemy, and were terrified.</p>

  <p>A single person was enough to take on a fourth-grade sect with millions of warriors. Such was the strength of the number one martial artist in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Imogen flew high up in the sky, looked at Eddie through the barrier, and asked faintly, "What brings you here, Evil East Lord?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," Eddie laughed wildly in response, like a bolt of lightning exploding in the sky. "Imogen, it has only been three months since the Martial Arts Contest. Even at your age, you can't be so forgetful, right?"</p>

  <p>Imogen was indifferent. She retorted, "As for what happened at the Martial Arts Contest, all the warriors in the Central Region know that Cloud Hall did not do anything wrong."</p>

  <p>"Wrong?" Eddie ridiculed her saying, "Did I say that you were wrong? My son's skills were inferior to Luo Zheng's, so he lost to him. My son's dedication to martial arts was not strong enough, so Luo Luo Zheng managed to destroy it. It was my son's fault. Marilyn was not powerful enough, so she was killed by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Obviously, it was her own fault."</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent. The elders of Cloud Hall had already heard about the events that had occurred during the Martial Arts Contest through various channels.</p>

  <p>"However, Eden is my son and Marilyn is my love. I have vowed to avenge them, no matter who my enemy is! Right now, you Cloud Hall is my enemy," Eddie sneered. "Being weak is wrong!"</p>

  <p>As he said this, he struck the crowd with a strong force. The elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm turned pale. Only Imogen, Ning Yudie, and Luo Luo Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly flew up to the light curtain, looking at Eddie through the thin Light of Water. "You're right, but so what if the Cloud Hall is wrong? So what if I'm weak?"</p>

  <p>"Give me your life as compensation," demanded Eddie nonchalantly. This ant-like little fellow didn't fear him at all. This was the case at the Martial Arts Contest, but it was still the same.</p>

  <p>"What if I don't?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>"In that case, after I kill you, I will ruin the entire Cloud Hall too," Eddie challenged Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone's collective heartbeat quickened at his words. No one could deny that Eddie was powerful enough to carry out his threat. Imogen was the strongest in Cloud Hall. Even if Ning Yudie joined the fight, it would still be impossible to stop Eddie. It seemed like the only thing they could rely on was this thin barrier in front of them.</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts were in their throats.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still had a smile on his face. He knew very well that fear, cowardice, or begging for mercy was useless. He calmly asked, "Can you do that?"</p>

  <p>"You can only rely on this barrier, right?" Eddie was smart. From the moment he arrived, he had found out that this barrier was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Back at the Martial Arts Contest, the barrier that blocked his fist strike was still fresh in his memory. There was actually a barrier in the Central Region that was able to block his fist strike!</p>

  <p>It was easy for him to guess that Luo Luo Zheng had enhanced the strength of the barrier. Presumably, he learned runes somewhere.</p>

  <p>But Eddie did not care. On that day he did not display his full strength but threw just two punches in anger. The barrier covering the arena was impressive, but it was impossible to stop Eddie.</p>

  <p>As for the barrier in front of him, Eddie thought nothing of it either.</p>

  <p>"You could say that," Luo Luo Zheng said as he stood at the edge of the barrier. At that moment, he was less than half a foot away from Eddie, almost as if he was standing face-to-face with him.</p>

  <p>Eddie slowly raised his wrist, shook his head and taunted, "I really hope you can maintain your calm!"</p>

  <p>Earthen yellow life vitality leaked out from Eddie's body. In the skies above the Cloud Hall, the rich energy of heaven and earth slowly gathered into a massive whirlpool, and the surrounding thick clouds also followed this whirlpool as it spun.</p>

  <p>After entering the Virtual Tribulation Realm, one could use the energy of heaven and earth. Eddie was a warrior of the Life and Death Realm, so the manic energy of heaven and earth was as obedient as a sheep in his hands.</p>

  <p>He did not intend to talk much with a young man at Illuminating Soul Realm. He did not even want to waste time here.</p>

  <p>As the energy poured into Eddie's body, a heavy force spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Eddie was about to attack.</p>

  <p>The people of the Cloud Hall also armed themselves with weapons and prepared for the battle. Deep in their hearts, the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm really wanted to hand Luo Luo Zheng over, but with Imogen and Ning Yudie here, it was impossible to do so.</p>

  <p>Imogen shook her old crutch and several tender buds grew on top of it. The light green life vitality enveloped her. As the life vitality circulated, her old skin started to regain color. The wrinkles on her face disappeared gradually, and her white hair turned black. As her short, stooping body became upright, she no longer looked old and frail.</p>

  <p>Imogen had turned into a beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>The Ice Phoenix quickly rushed out of the Ice Palace, rammed into Ning Yudie and started to disintegrate. The ice crystal armor wrapped tightly around her petite body. At the same time, the Mysterious Ice Halberd also appeared in her hands.</p>

  <p>Once Eddie broke the barrier, the people from the Cloud Hall could not sit still and wait for death.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Luo Zheng stood behind the barrier, unmoved, as he faced Eddie who was about to attack.</p>
