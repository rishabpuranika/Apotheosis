<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2989 The Secret Of The Copper Sheet </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Doubts continued to linger inside Zheng's mind. However, he didn't say anything when he saw how pleased Kenelm and the others were.</p>

  <p>After all, they had worked hard to get the tomb. The last thing Zheng wanted was to pour cold water on them. Additionally, he didn't know much about the Source World. Perhaps the Sword Light Palace had truly set such a weird kind of rule.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Kenelm immediately collected the belongings of the Stinger Guard. Then, they left the underground cave and hurriedly returned to the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>Later that day, Kenelm hosted a fantastic banquet at the biggest restaurant in the Excellence City. Zheng had already made up his mind that he would refuse to join the banquet. However, Kenelm's kind words changed his mind as he finally accepted the invitation.</p>

  <p>"I have entrusted a caravan to send the news about the tomb to the Sword Light Palace. With their great efficiency, they'll certainly complete the task almost immediately. I believe that it won't take long before they come to the Excellence City." Kenelm raised his cup as a sign of respect. Afterward, he looked at Zheng with sincere eyes. "If it hadn't been for you, we would not have been able to enter that cave. Thank you very much!"</p>

  <p>After he said such kind remarks, Kenelm pulled his cup towards his mouth and gulped the wine.</p>

  <p>An appreciative smile was revealed in Zheng's face as he followed Kenelm's toast.</p>

  <p>After the toast, a friend of Kenelm said in a curious tone, "I really want to know the star class of the owner of the tomb."</p>

  <p>The Stinger Guards were similar to the Nine Li Guards and the Yellow Emperor Guards. However, the Sword Light Palace was still inferior to the super forces like the Bearing race and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Is it really that important?" Zheng asked curiously. With creased eyebrows, he looked at the speaker with confusion.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, Kenelm blinked his eyes and answered seriously, "Of course it is! If the owner of the tomb was a one-star Stinger Guard, his belongings can be exchanged for a place in the Sword Light Palace. If he was a two-star Stinger Guard, that means we can have two places.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if he was a five-star Stinger Guard..."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the audience lit up as they heard the remarks from Kenelm.</p>

  <p>They were already aware of the rules of the Sword Light Palace. The rewards from the rules were the main reason why they risked their lives to follow Kenelm in search of the tomb.</p>

  <p>That was an opportunity they couldn't miss. They were currently consummate True Gods. If they could join the Sword Light Palace, their future would definitely be bright. With the abundant resources of the Sword Light Palace, it would be possible for them to enter the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Zheng maintained his composure and remained calm. Truth to be told, he wasn't really interested in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>In his long adventure in the divine land, he had already met the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm like Timotheus and Emily. Even with their enhanced strength, Zheng didn't think they were that big of a deal.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had already stepped into the Sea of Truth. Therefore, the resources of the Sword Light Palace didn't pique his interest.</p>

  <p>After the banquet, Zheng returned to the house arranged by Kenelm. With a wave of his hand, he cast an enchanted barrier to separate himself from the outside world.</p>

  <p>After he was sure that he couldn't be disturbed or spied on, Zheng took out a few space rings that previously belonged to Allen and his men.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his companions knew that Zheng had taken away those rings, but they said nothing. If it wasn't for Zheng's help, they wouldn't have succeeded.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they thought the several space rings were rightfully his rewards.</p>

  <p>It took a while, but Zheng eventually sorted out all the things in the space rings. The treasures of Allen's men were all very ordinary. They only had twenty divine crystals in total. Other people might view such loot as a large fortune, but Zheng wasn't impressed by it.</p>

  <p>However, Allen's space ring had several extraordinary objects. A sword as thin as a cicada's wings was one of the treasures. When the sword was pulled out, a tinge of cold air was emitted, which was about to condense into something.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng possessed the Soaring Snake Sword, he couldn't use it most of the time. Allen's sword would definitely be a fine replacement for the time being.</p>

  <p>In addition to the majestic sword, Zheng had also found some special magic weapons and over a thousand divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Compared to Zheng's wealth, such a loot was already too common to mention.</p>

  <p>However, Allen was already rich compared to the consummate True Gods of his level.</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng took out the octagonal copper sheet. With curious eyes, he studied it carefully. After a while, he asked with creased eyebrows, "No. 9527, do you know what it is?"</p>

  <p>"No, sorry. I don't know what that is," answered No. 9527 almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Although it knew many secrets and information that most people did not know, it still had its limits. It was rather impossible for it to know everything since the world was very complicated.</p>

  <p>Without a useful answer from No. 9527, Zheng's curiosity heightened. With caution, he put his finger on the surface of the copper sheet. Then, he gently tapped his fingertip. A drop of blood immediately dripped and quickly slipped down. However, he still didn't find anything unusual.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he channeled the internal momentum onto the lines of the copper sheet. Nonetheless, the copper sheet remained unresponsive.</p>

  <p>After he thought for a while, an idea brightened up Zheng's mind. With a smirk on his face, he took out a divine crystal.</p>

  <p>The divine crystals were used to feed the Other Shore Tokens. Zheng learned such a technique when he was in the divine land. Since the True Gods didn't have the Other Shore Tokens, the divine crystals could only be used as a currency in trades.</p>

  <p>Zheng put the divine crystal in front of him. Afterward, he grabbed it with two fingers and pinched it gently. With a click, blue energy flowed out of it like water.</p>

  <p>It might be a waste to use the divine crystal that way. However, out of mere curiosity, Zheng was more than willing to try it.</p>

  <p>When the blue energy flowed on the copper sheet, it was immediately absorbed by the symmetrical lines on the sheet's surface.</p>

  <p>As he witnessed the absorption of the blue energy, Zheng couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. It seemed that his hunch was correct.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A slight tremble of the copper sheet separated the lines from its surface.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the lines constantly moved to form an extremely complicated map. In the center of the map was a golden mark which looked like a Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"What map is this? Where is this? Why is there a golden Sanskrit word in it?" There was a strange expression in Zheng's eyes. Confusion seemed to overwhelm him.</p>

  <p>With sharp eyes, Zheng carefully studied the map. After some time, he finally asked, "No. 9527, do you know where this map..."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," No. 9527 replied decidedly even before Zheng could finish his words.</p>

  <p>Disappointment enveloped Zheng as he pursed his lips. It seemed that he had to figure out the origin of the octagonal copper sheet by himself.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what the golden Sanskrit word meant, but he could turn to his son for help. Geoffrey was still in his inner world, and he should be able to figure out the meaning of the golden Sanskrit word. He had to put the copper sheet into his inner world and ask Geoffrey to study it.</p>

  <p>Two days later, a silver flying ship suddenly streaked through the dark sky and appeared in the air above the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>It scanned the area and checked the direction before it berthed at a dock next to the East Port.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>An old man in a fur robe appeared from the ship. A furious aura enveloped him as he came down from the ship. His face was darkened with anger.</p>

  <p>A guard behind the old man came forward and saluted. With a respectful voice, he said, "Master Baber, although the Excellence City is a remote and small city, the people and their relationships are complex here. It is difficult to find Master Allen."</p>

  <p>When the old man heard Allen's name, pain appeared in his eyes. His eyelids trembled a few times as his confusion seemed to settle. After a while, he said, "Go and buy news from the Mice League! We have to find this murderer by any means!"</p>
