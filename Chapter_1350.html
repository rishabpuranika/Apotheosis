<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Queen of Punishment stared blankly at Xun's statue, which seemed to stare back at her. She'd felt a deep sense of foreboding— if she did not kill Xun the soonest possible, she might end up being dethroned.</p>

  <p>She had learned from the queen's statue that a strand of Xun's soul still remained. As long as the statue wasn't completely dark, Xun's soul was alive somewhere in this universe.</p>

  <p>However, the Queen of Punishment thought that it was useless.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul would soon vanish any time, like a candle flame amidst a gale.</p>

  <p>Thus, she didn't think too much when she found out about Xun through the queen's statue.</p>

  <p>The remaining soul had little to no effect, and at that time Luo Zheng was only a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. To her, Luo Zheng was no more than a mosquito.</p>

  <p>The second time the Queen of Punishment saw Luo Zheng, he had broken through to the Life and Death Realm. It had only taken him a year or two and he also had quite the fast cultivation speed. However, she still didn't consider him a big threat. In her opinion, warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm and the Life and Death Realm weren't that powerful.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she had decided to be on guard during that time.</p>

  <p>That was why she had forcefully controlled the members of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place— she had intended to destroy Xun's soul. However, Luo Zheng had discovered her plan in advance, and managed to stop her from fulfilling her plan.</p>

  <p>And now, Xun's soul had gotten a million times stronger!</p>

  <p>It was further confirmed as it was something that she could sense from the statue, which was filled with killing intent.</p>

  <p>'An almighty master has helped Xun repair her soul...' The Queen of Punishment's face was unreadable. 'It seemed like that man has ascended to the Upper World, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>While Xun's soul had been repaired, it still wasn't enough to threaten the Queen of Punishment— only later, she had discovered that Xun's soul which used to be like only a spark, seemed to have the power to burn now.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Queen felt uneasy and threatened.</p>

  <p>It was possible to restore Xun's soul now, which meant that she could obtain a complete physical body in the future. She might even recover her cultivation and be strong enough to fight back against the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, the Queen of Punishment began to feel queasy. Even Xun's statue looked like it had a mocking look in its eyes.</p>

  <p>"How dare you mock me?" With teeth clenched, the Queen of Punishment angrily flicked a finger. An invisible wave of energy rippled out, which caused Xun's statue to crack and suddenly collapse.</p>

  <p>The queens' statues which were scattered throughout sacred places of the Demon Night were made of different materials. Those that were in the Queen of Punishment's hall were made of the best adamantine spar, but could not withstand the power of a light flick from her finger.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Punishment glanced at Xun's statue. Even though it was broken, its head was still intact, and even looked back at her with wide, open eyes.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hand and lightly flicked it again, and the head of Xun's statue finally shattered.</p>

  <p>But although Xun's statue was no more, it wasn't enough to quell her mood. She was even more agitated as she walked around the hall.</p>

  <p>At that moment, there was a heavy tapping sound against the hall's floor.</p>

  <p>Two female guards in leather armor walked into the hall, and then knelt down on one knee in front of the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>"My Queen, we have already found Amber's whereabouts. She flew into the Black Spark World three days ago," one of the female guards reported.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Punishment's lips curved up into an icy smile. "Really? I never thought that she would even ascend into the Upper World! Bring her here!"</p>

  <p>During the battle between the Queen of Punishment and the Queen of Killings, Amber had maintained a neutral stance. The battle between the two queens was something she couldn't partake in.</p>

  <p>Of course, Xun and Luo Zheng didn't blame her. Besides, she had done her best to help Xun and Luo Zheng even though she couldn't defy the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>However, the Queen of Punishment didn't find Amber's decision acceptable. For her, it was an unforgivable betrayal!</p>

  <p>And because she was the queen in charge of punishments, anyone who crossed her would be the receiving end of her unimaginable wrath.</p>

  <p>Although it was useless to punish Amber, she needed to calm down quickly, and Amber was perfect for the job.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Punishment wasn't the only one who knew that Xun's soul had recovered. Almost everyone in the Demon Night paid their respects to the queens' statues almost everyday, so naturally they had noticed as well.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Queen of Punishment, all the warriors in the sacred places of the Demon Night also knew that the Queen of Killings' strength seemed to restore quickly... There were even some warriors among them who once followed and supported Xun!</p>

  <p>What was more, there was even a Supreme Lord who supported Xun as well!</p>

  <p>Roughly an hour later, that Supreme Lord's voice resounded throughout the universe, and it was old and sorrowful.</p>

  <p>"Xun, are you back? Are you back in the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>His voice was heard by every living creature. Of course, the Queen of Punishment, Luo Zheng, and Xun had all heard it.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Xun mumbled.</p>

  <p>She was surprised to hear the call, as she had never expected it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she realized who it was. "It's Leroy Meng! Supreme Lord Leroy!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Beside her, Zheng's eyebrows twitched in confusion. "Who's Supreme Lord Leroy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He's one of my supporters!" Xun said with a smile.</p>

  <p>However, her expression soon dimmed as she lamented, "He's probably the only Supreme Lord left among my supporters. Moreover, he might've been severely injured and hid away from the Demon Night..."</p>

  <p>It was generally known that every queen of the Demon Night had their own many supporters.</p>

  <p>In the past, Leroy Meng wasn't the only Supreme Lord who supported Xun. But as she and the Queen of Punishment fought, the latter had used every method to get benefits. Besides, with Xun's carelessness at that time, some of Xun's supporters had changed their minds and sided with the Queen of Punishment instead.</p>

  <p>Majority of the warriors in the Demon Night were female, and only a few male warriors had become Supreme Lords. Leroy Meng, who was both a male warrior and a Supreme Lord had supported Xun all the way.</p>

  <p>It was because of his support for Xun that he'd gotten attacked by several other Supreme Lords of the Demon Night. When he became seriously injured, he had no choice but to escape and hide.</p>

  <p>But even though in hiding, Leroy Meng had created a queen's statue. He had also noticed the abnormality of Xun's statue and guessed that she might've already ascended to the Upper World. It was why he used the Roaring Token to try to talk to her.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that I don't have a Roaring Token, so I can't respond to Leroy," Xun said miserably.</p>

  <p>A strange smile formed on Zheng's face when he heard her words. It was true that Xun didn't have a Roaring Token, but Luo Zheng had one...</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to tell Xun that he had a Roaring Token, they heard another voice.</p>

  <p>"Leroy, you're such a shameless traitor. Haven't you died yet? Ha-ha! If I remember correctly, you were supposed to enter the Five Aging Processes!"</p>

  <p>Xun thought that the voice sounded quite familiar. Luo Zheng also knew who it was. It belonged to the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>When Xun heard her call Leroy Meng a traitor, she felt annoyed and infuriated. But her face remained stone cold as she said, "One day Yao, I will definitely destroy your position of being a queen!"</p>

  <p>"So the Queen of Punishment is called Yao," Luo Zheng said. He decided to remember her name by heart, as he couldn't always call her a bitch.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Leroy Meng responded right away, "You bitch, you're not even qualified to call me a traitor! Xun's soul has recovered a lot, and some powerful master might've even helped her. I'm sure that you'll be dethroned someday. I am indeed about to enter the Five Aging Processes, but I believe that I could wait and see you be exiled in the future!"</p>

  <p>Leroy's words had sent Xun into a state of frenzy.</p>

  <p>Back then, Xun had always maintained a calm and cold exterior no matter the situation. However, she was extremely excited right now, which had never happened before.</p>

  <p>"A powerful master has helped her? Ha-ha! Just so you know, only a part of her soul has been repaired, and she hasn't completely recovered yet.</p>

  <p>She even has no way of responding to you right now. I'm afraid that she doesn't even have a Roaring Token!" the Queen of Punishment sneered.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a few other voices from around the universe chimed in as well.</p>

  <p>"Leroy, find a suitable replacement for Xun, as the Queen of Killings is right.</p>

  <p>Why are you still so stubborn? Can't you see the current situation now?"</p>

  <p>"Now, it's impossible for Xun to return to the Demon Night. Her remnant soul won't be able to hold on for long..."</p>

  <p>"Leroy, do you think we're only good for show? Who in the universe could cast Yao off the throne? You? Humph! Don't be so silly!"</p>

  <p>Those who responded with the Roaring Tokens were none other than the Night Demon's Supreme Lords, who were all supporters of the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>When Xun heard their words, she bit her bottom lip and said, "It's really sad that I don't have a Roaring Token..."</p>

  <p>While Xun felt gloomy, Luo Zheng simply smiled.</p>

  <p>Xun saw Luo Zheng and frowned. "What's so funny?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have a Roaring Token," Luo Zheng said with a sly smile.</p>
