  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stepped onto the first floor of the Tower of Sin, many creatures of various races stared at him with eyes filled with reverence.</p>

  <p>However, the eyes of the many ogre war fighters were only filled with unbridled fear.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng was a human war general less than twenty years old and had only been in the Tower of Sin for three months, he had already turned the tables for the entire human race.</p>

  <p>Despite being just a mere war general who used to be a war fighter when he had first entered the Tower of Sin, he had rendered the top-level war lords helpless, and had even used the power of the Cursed Land to indirectly kill two ogre war sages.</p>

  <p>No one in their right mind would attribute those to luck and coincidence.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the process, Luo Luo Zheng had indeed succeeded and had thoroughly suppressed the arrogance of the ogres.</p>

  <p>In the past, from the first floor to the fourteenth floor of the Tower of Sin, regardless of whether it was an ogre war fighter or an ogre war general, they were all superior to other creatures. Their powerful race had more seats in the Tower of Sin than any other race, and they also had the most powerful forces on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Also, no creature dared to confront the ogres head on. Apart from the Demon Night, the other races could only clench their fists in anger in front of them.</p>

  <p>The reason why the ogres were so arrogant was that they were the most powerful race on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, the ogres had been very restrained recently. From war fighters to war generals, and even war lords, their voices were not as loud as they had been in the past. One could even find a trace of fear and uncertainty on their faces as of late.</p>

  <p>It was because they didn't know what Luo Luo Zheng was going to do to them when he returned to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Would he drive all the ogres out of the tower? Or would he just kill them all?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have used some kind of power to expel the two powerful ogre war sages out of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>But whether or not Luo Luo Zheng could use the power of the Tower of Sin to exterminate the creatures in the tower, or whether he had any other methods, everything would still depend on how well Luo Luo Zheng controlled the tower. The outsiders couldn't figure it out. After all, the Tower of Sin itself was very mysterious. The creatures on the Sea God Continent didn't know its origins or the secrets of the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>In short, ever since Luo Luo Zheng did what he did, the ogres had been acting like struggling fishes on a chopping board. They were in such a tricky situation.</p>

  <p>Now, as for whether they would fight Luo Luo Zheng or would instead try to make peace with him, everyone could only wait and see.</p>

  <p>After entering the first floor of the Tower of Sin, Luo Luo Zheng looked at Esther and the rest and suddenly said, with a smile on his lips, "You take the stairs. I want to take another way."</p>

  <p>Esther, Cheryl and the other members of the Demon Night looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a strange expression. There was only one path to the lower floors of the Tower of Sin, and that was to take the stairs. They didn't understand why Luo Luo Zheng said there was another way.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng finished what he was saying, a circular crack that seemed to only allow one person to fall in appeared beneath his feet. Standing directly on top of it, Luo Luo Zheng fell through when it opened.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, all of the top-level war lords, including Esther, were stunned. How could Luo Luo Zheng play like this in the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng landed firmly on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Many war fighters on the second floor were shocked when the ceiling suddenly cracked open and a human general fell from the crack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shot the war fighters an indifferent glance before another round crack appeared beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>And it went on? the third floor, fourth, fifth, sixth... Every floor had a crack in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body continued to fall vertically. Within just a few seconds, his feet finally landed on the floor of the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>From the third to the ninth floor, the war fighters and war generals only saw a shadow shooting down, and they didn't have any idea who it was.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the tenth floor, the cracks of the previous floors he had been in began moving and quickly disappeared, leaving behind the stupefied expressions of all the creatures who saw them.</p>

  <p>"Hey, did you see that?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. It seems like a human was falling down...a hole?"</p>

  <p>"This... I'm afraid that was truly the fastest way to go to any floor in the Tower of Sin."</p>

  <p>Even the top-level war lords on the fifteenth floor had to climb the stairs to go to another floor. During the battle between the war lords, there was a time when the ceiling was broken and a war lord fell to the next floor.</p>

  <p>While the floors of the Tower of Sin had the ability to heal themselves, they weren't particularly sturdy. But no war lord had dared to break through one in order to go to another floor.</p>

  <p>In the arena on the tenth floor, a nimble figure was flying about. It was Olivia, a divine-level talent of the human race.</p>

  <p>Her opponent was a giant who was nearly forty feet tall.</p>

  <p>Olivia practiced the cultivation method with the ice attribute. The cold air formed rings that surrounded the giant one after another.</p>

  <p>The giants of the Sea God Continent were all incomparably powerful. Even if an ogre was punched by a giant, he would be smashed into minced meat, let alone a human.</p>

  <p>But as scary as the giants could be, their weakness was very obvious. They were too slow, and they couldn't keep up with their opponents most of the time, mainly because of their sizes.</p>

  <p>Now, under the constant suppression of Olivia's ice rings, the giant's speed was even slower. Although the iron rod in his hand was constantly swinging, it couldn't even come anywhere near her.</p>

  <p>When Olivia saw Luo Luo Zheng suddenly appear on the tenth floor, her eyes sparkled and a smile appeared on her face. As life vitality flashed between her eyebrows, the cold energy suddenly erupted from her body.</p>

  <p>A pair of wings of ice formed behind her, and she turned into a streak of light as she charged towards the giant.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was because she wanted to show how powerful she was to impress Luo Luo Zheng, or perhaps it was because she was excited to leave the arena to meet him, she directly used her trump card.</p>

  <p>As a divine-level talent, Olivia was one of the best warriors on the tenth floor. There was no need to use her trump card when dealing with this giant.</p>

  <p>"Swift Ice Feather!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Olivia was like a fairy in the snow, swiftly floating towards the giant. Facing the oncoming iron rod, she made a strange turn in the air, easily dodging the powerful strike from her opponent.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, her figure rapidly approached the giant. When she reached him, she extended her snow-white hand and lightly stroked the giant's neck.</p>

  <p>A seed of ice and snow was instantly planted within it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The neck of the giant flashed with a white light, and an icy frost immediately blossomed, creating a beautiful ice flower.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the blood vessels in the giant's arms, chest, and legs started cracking. The moment blood came out from the giant's body, it was frozen.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>The giant's incomparably huge body crashed onto the floor. Olivia was standing firmly at the side of the arena, watching her attack take effect. A ray of Lucky Light shot out from the giant's body, shooting towards the token on her chest.</p>

  <p>Pak, pak, pak! A clear round of applause for her rang out.</p>

  <p>Slowly walking towards the arena, Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his hands to clap with the spectators. At that moment, the eyes of all the creatures on the tenth floor were focused on him.</p>

  <p>In the days following Luo Zheng's departure, many humans had already felt the subtle changes in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>In this situation, even a fool would understand that the human race was on the verge of rising up.</p>

  <p>In the past, as long as humans stepped into the arena, they would encounter endless ridicule and hostility from other races. Their opponents would also never show mercy to them. Humans were likely to get severely injured or killed by their opponents in the arena.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, however, whenever humans walked into the arena, their opponents would always be extremely cautious. Even if humans were defeated, their opponents would not take advantage of the victory to pursue and take their lives.</p>

  <p>This change caused many of the humans to become overjoyed. It was very clear that this change originated from one person, and that person was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the human race still only had four seats, it wouldn't be long before that number would increase. Every human was excited for it, for how far the human race could grow. At first, all of that seemed like it would depend on how far the ogres would be willing to give in. Now, however, it seemed like it solely depended on how Luo Luo Zheng would behave.</p>

  <p>And on that gracious day, Luo Luo Zheng had finally returned.</p>

  <p>When Olivia saw Luo Luo Zheng clapping his hands, a smile appeared on her lips. She then quickly jumped off the arena and walked towards him.</p>
