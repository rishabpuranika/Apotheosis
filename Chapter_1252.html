  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ice that Ning Yudie had condensed was as hard as iron, but still Zheng's power erupted, the muscles in his body trembling. Countless cracks appeared on the surface of the ice coffin. From the outside, the originally transparent and flawless ice coffin donned a milky white color due to the cracks.</p>

  <p>This was followed by a sharp sound when the ice coffin suddenly shattered.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was still peeved. When the ice coffin collapsed, she once again released her strong life vitality and another ice coffin replaced it.</p>

  <p>However, soon after, Luo Zheng used his strength again and the new ice coffin broke down.</p>

  <p>As the ice shards continued to condense and collapse underneath the pair of them, their number kept increasing. The ice shards gathered together to form a small ice mountain, causing the two to ascend higher and higher.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie went through her tribulation last time, the dome of the Ice Palace had almost been ruined by her. Afterward, it was reconstructed, leaving an opening in the dome. One could see the sky through it in the middle of the palace.</p>

  <p>As the ice mountain continued to rise, it pushed the two of them through the opening in the roof.</p>

  <p>Yudie's Ice Palace was not only built in the deepest part of the Cloud Hall, it was also the highest point.</p>

  <p>Guards patrolled the Cloud Hall. Their eyesights and vision were strong.</p>

  <p>If the warriors below looked up, they would witness the scene at the top of the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still held Ning Yudie tightly in his arms when the ice mountain lifted them out of the roof.</p>

  <p>"Why is there an ice mountain growing out of the Ice Palace?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that the leader is in the process of cultivating a new method?</p>

  <p>Is there a new breakthrough?"</p>

  <p>"Idiot! Can't you see that there are two people on top of the ice mountain?"</p>

  <p>Although the discussions were taking place quite far away, as a Life and Death Realm warrior, Ning Yudie had a keen sense of hearing. Even though their voices were hushed, she could hear them clearly.</p>

  <p>She felt embarrassed and ashamed. Lowering her voice, she said to Luo Zheng angrily, "Let go of me!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not letting you go!" Luo Zheng said to Ning Yudie with resolution.</p>

  <p>"Please!" Ning Yudie had never begged in her life, but she felt she had no other choice.</p>

  <p>"It's useless even if you beg me." A trace of a smile surfaced on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The various elders, stewards, and disciples of Cloud Hall realized that they must stay away and give Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng some private moments, but they could not contain their curiosity. More and more people looked up at the couple from windows and corners.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face turned red from pale. The blush spread across her neck.</p>

  <p>Even though she was lying on the ice-cool mountain, it didn't do anything to help the temperature. She suddenly felt warm all over.</p>

  <p>She was furious and mortified. After repeatedly begging Luo Zheng to no avail, Ning Yudie, who was always as tough as a man, could not hold it in any longer and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"You jerk! You're bullying me!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"I like bullying you," Luo Zheng said playfully, grinning and staring fixedly at her pretty face.</p>

  <p>Tears welled up in Yudie's eyes as she bit Zheng's shoulder heavily.</p>

  <p>However, his body was strong like a sacred weapon. Her teeth almost broke due to the bite.</p>

  <p>She couldn't beat him, nor could she scold him. Now, she couldn't even bite him! She was like a helpless little girl, burying her head in his shoulder and crying.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ran his fingers through Yudie's hair, lifted her head and pulled her face close to his. He looked at her tear-stained face, lowered his head and gently kissed her lips.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie whined unwillingly, but not long after, she gave up resisting and closed her eyes, giving in to the kiss. She kissed him back passionately.</p>

  <p>As the leader of Cloud Hall, she could not believe herself. She was kissing a man on the top of the Ice Palace under the watchful eyes of so many warriors. However, she stopped giving it any thought. She was so absorbed in the kiss that she forgot about the people witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of a small thatched cottage on the side of Cloud Hall, Imogen gazed at the pair with a satisfied smile on her face. After a long while, she turned around and entered her cottage, muttering, "It is perfectly normal for young people to kiss each other."</p>

  <p>When Yudie's frenzied mind calmed down, she reached out behind Zheng's back and gently pressed a hand to the ice mountain. The ice disappeared in an instant, turning into life vitality and dissipating in the air.</p>

  <p>Losing support of the small ice mountain, Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie plummeted downward.</p>

  <p>Thud! Luo Zheng fell to the ground with a heavy sound while Ning Yudie used him as a cushion. Her petite body bounced from his body, her hands adjusting her messy long hair as she stared at Luo Zheng with a shy smile.</p>

  <p>Their passionate kiss had aroused him. Many warriors had experienced the beauty of sex at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. However, Luo Zheng had only slept with one woman before and that was Mu Ning. He was unable to contain his desire for long. With a flash, he pulled Ning Yudie close again.</p>

  <p>This time, Ning Yudie showed signs of panic. She covered her chest with her hands and frowned. "No!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng pouted. He wouldn't force Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"You promised me before! We can only do that after our wedding."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was a strong warrior, but deep in her heart, she was a very traditional woman. Many warriors did not value marriage, but she was an exception.</p>

  <p>She did not want this so soon, so Luo Zheng didn't force her. "Then tomorrow we'll start preparing for our wedding ceremony," he whispered softly in her ear.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips but didn't say anything else, meaning that she agreed with him.</p>

  <p>The news of their wedding ceremony soon spread like wildfire across the Central Region through the World Commercial Alliance's channels within a matter of three days.</p>

  <p>Currently, the World Commercial Alliance was the largest force in the Central Region. However, the Cloud Hall, which Luo Zheng belonged to, was the largest sect. They had sent out countless invitations to the third-grade forces and above in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The fight between Ning Yudie and Mu Ning seemed to have come to an end.</p>

  <p>In the past, Ning Yudie could not have imagined sharing her husband with another woman. But now, even though she had strong jealousy in her heart, she had to let go of it because of Luo Zheng. In the future, she and Mu Ning might quarrel a lot, but at present, she did not care for it.</p>

  <p>Preparations for the wedding ceremony continued for more than a month. After an auspicious day was selected, the transmission array in the Cloudy City flashed continuously, and the reputable warriors came to congratulate the couple. The various rare gifts alone were the size of a small hill about twenty to thirty feet high.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall had been whitewashed and had a bright, new look.</p>

  <p>The three divine textures created by Luo Zheng had made the Cloud Hall's runic expert, Felix, feel inferior to him. Even if he expended all his energy, he still wouldn't be able to set up a sect-protecting array as strong as Zheng's.</p>

  <p>However, Felix's talent in runes was nothing to be ashamed of. By studying Zheng's divine textures, his knowledge of runes had increased manifold. Other than Luo Zheng, no one else in the Central Region was stronger than him. This time, Felix did help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He created several runes to decorate the Cloud Hall. Their power was not exceptional, but as long as one replenished life vitality crystals to activate the runes, they effused different colors. Some rays projected onto the enchanted barrier named the Light of Water and morphed into flying dragons and phoenixes, dancing on top of it with exuberance.</p>

  <p>In the Cloud Hall's Martial Arts Hall, a dense pack of warriors had gathered from all over Central Region. These big names were all leaders of various top clans and sects.</p>

  <p>Of course, the sect leaders of the fourth-grade sects, including the Mysterious Luna Hall, Bloodwood Cliff and Black Mountain Sect, were all present.</p>

  <p>When they had first met Luo Zheng, he had merely been a junior at the Illuminating Soul Realm. However, right before their eyes, Zheng's cultivation level soared without limits, and soon no one in the Central Region could contend with him. As they came up to congratulate him, they sighed in their hearts. They used to look down on him, but now all they could do was worship him.</p>
