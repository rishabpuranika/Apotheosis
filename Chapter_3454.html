</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly taken aback when seeing the Evil God fall out from the space channel. Then, Chaim sent him a message using the life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," he said, "he can use the blood theurgy of anyone in this world, but once a warrior leaves, he can no longer use the blood theurgy of that warrior!"</p>

  <p>Since Mount had moved outside of the world using spatial transference, Zheng immediately understood everything.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that you lost a bloodline theurgy as soon as I appeared.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it is the truth-level theurgy of a Chaos Ancient God," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>So, it turned out Mount carried the blood of a Chaos Ancient God. No wonder his blood theurgy was so powerful!</p>

  <p>Shera had once introduced the many powerful masters of this world to him.</p>

  <p>Those Chaos Ancient Gods she told him were the founders of the entire chaos and they were the most powerful beings!</p>

  <p>No wonder Mount's blood theurgy could easily break the restriction of the Chaotic Source World. Now that he lost such a priceless bloodline theurgy, he clenched his fists tightly with regret.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it's a pity," the Evil God sighed, then straightened up. "I'll just redeem it with your life!"</p>

  <p>In the Evil God's eyes, Zheng kept countless secrets.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a creature born in Zheng's inner world. If he managed to control his own master, it'd be an incredible feat.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess flashed behind the Evil God and he flew towards Zheng at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng promptly flew backward, in what looked like an attempt to evade the approaching Evil God.</p>

  <p>Even though the Evil God couldn't use the spatial transference now, the bloodline theurgies he had now were still difficult to deal with! In the blink of an eye, the Evil God closed in on Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blood red shadow of the Snake Goddess swept over Zheng, poised to strike. However, to the Evil God's surprise, Zheng didn't retreat this time. He passed through the energy streams and reached behind the Evil God with unimaginable agility. Then, Zheng drew his long sword.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng moved extremely fast, the Evil God reacted just as quickly.</p>

  <p>With three heads and six arms, he didn't even need to turn around. The Evil God's hands clenched into fists and swung at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's eyes flashed a menacing red. At the sight of this, a trace of fear welled up within the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's soul force was extremely powerful; even the power of fear from the giant eye had difficulty fazing him.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes of the Evil God, Zheng was the creator that had made him after all. He still maintained a trace of innate reverence for Zheng deep in his heart.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God looked into the eyes of his creator now, he couldn't help but tremble.</p>

  <p>This gave Zheng a split second to act. In a flash, he swung his long sword, slicing deep into the Evil God's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Phew...</p>

  <p>While Zheng had put a lot of effort into that blow, to his disappointment, the blade of his sword had sunk only three inches into the shoulder of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had several bloodline theurgies to protect himself. The Mighty Golden Body of the Separate Abyss race alone was enough to make his body indestructible, not to mention that there were other bloodlines to strengthen his physical body. So how could Zheng possibly pierce further?</p>

  <p>With so many bloodline theurgies working together, the Evil God's body was even stronger than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Click, click, click!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's three right arms stretched out simultaneously and each seized the blade of Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>With the power of the Mighty Golden Body, his three right arms gleamed with metallic luster. When they gripped the long sword, it sounded like metals clanging.</p>

  <p>"Clang clang clang..."</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, the three arms actually broke the sword into pieces!</p>

  <p>As the Evil God's three right arms destroyed the long sword, the three arms on his left side reached out to grab Zheng. Since he finally had the opportunity to get close to Zheng, he wouldn't let go of Zheng so easily.</p>

  <p>But Zheng acted quick. Even before the long sword broke, he had let go of the sword and darted backwards.</p>

  <p>With the help of that cyan feather, his escape was made skillfully and elegantly.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was about to put distance between him and the Evil God, the Evil God suddenly stretched out the palms of his three left hands.</p>

  <p>In each palm, a colorful whirlpool had formed. Gritting his teeth, Zheng felt the strong gravitational pull of each whirlpool.</p>

  <p>"It's the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race!" Chaim cried in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I hope Zheng won't be sucked in! Since the Evil God came from Zheng's inner world, there won't be any barrier for Zheng to be absorbed!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Seeing Dorothy's and Chaim's horrified expressions, Sally cocked her head in confusion. "Dorothy, this White Myth race isn't a big race...their bloodline theurgy shouldn't be a big deal, right?"</p>

  <p>It was true. The White Myth race was so small in number that they were practically ignored. At the time the Chaotic Source World opened, they were granted only one ticket.</p>

  <p>However, the member of the White Myth race who had gotten into the Chaotic Source World was a bit lucky, as he made it to the core area without any hitches. But since he made it there alone, he didn't get any Chaotic Source Spirit and had no choice but to seek shelter in an array.</p>

  <p>He had patiently waited for an opportunity. Alone, there was no way he could take down the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. No, he needed to wait till other warriors arrived and chaos ensued. Maybe, in the midst of the chaos, he'd be able to snag some crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits...</p>

  <p>The blood theurgy of the White Myth race was very special. The entrance to their inner worlds was not in the cinnabar field, but was a whirlpool on the palm of their hands.</p>

  <p>It could absorb mountains, rivers, trees and houses, and sometimes, even some unintelligent creatures.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the blood theurgy of the White Myth race could have a miraculous effect. For example, when the powerful warriors of the Source World had broken into the Heavenly Riverway, they would like to recruit some warriors from the White Myth race. This was because there was a kind of poisonous mosquitoes that dwelled in the Heavenly Riverway.</p>

  <p>These mosquitoes were extremely difficult to kill; neither fire nor water could do any harm to them.</p>

  <p>However, these mosquitoes were quite unintelligent, and acted only on instinct. The White Myth race needed only to extend their hands to activate the whirlpools, then the mosquitoes would be sucked into their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>As they were the creators of their own inner worlds, they could do anything they wanted. In their inner world, it was a piece of cake for them to kill off the mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>However, there was a catch to the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race, which had something to do with the weakness of their inner worlds. If they tried to suck in an intelligent creature, the creature needed to willingly accept in order for them to enter their inner world.</p>

  <p>For example, when Zheng tried to suck No. 9527 into his inner world, it would only be successful if No. 9527 didn't resist.</p>

  <p>If one showed the littlest bit of resistance, they would not be pulled into the inner world of the other party.</p>

  <p>As a result, this trick was only useful with unintelligent or even dead creatures; in actual combat, it was rendered useless.</p>

  <p>However, in the case of the Evil God and Zheng, the situation was different.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng and the Evil God came from the same origin, the two of them didn't have the slightest rejection to each other.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the Chaotic Source World, Dorothy had reminded Zheng that the Evil God could be used as an Inner-world Generating Avatar for him, because there was no rejection between them.</p>

  <p>Consequently, this worked vice versa. If the Evil God was strong enough, he could easily refine Zheng into an Inner-world Generating Avatar!</p>
