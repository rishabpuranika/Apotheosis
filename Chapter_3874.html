<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3874 Taking Advantage Of The Moment </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It never occurred to Claire that someone would dare to attack her.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, no one matched her in strength, other than the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>She was moving to the left, as the Grandmaster of Heaven fell towards that direction.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as she emerged from the space channel, a long spear shot towards her unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The spear itself was extremely sturdy, and the power contained within it was immensely great.</p>

  <p>The impact from the spear sent Claire flying back into the space channel.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she slammed into it so hard that the space channel was smashed into pieces. As she flew backwards, the space around her cracked and shattered.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God waved his hand, the spear moved according to his control, dancing in the air a few times.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Finally, he had adjusted the spear enough for it to point directly towards Claire. Without any hesitation, the Evil God launched another spear attack on her.</p>

  <p>Claire had been caught off guard. When she finally came to her senses and saw the spear shooting towards her, her eyes flashed with rage.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>She violently swung Luo Zheng, using him to parry the incoming spear.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the spear didn't shatter, but she did manage to deflect it.</p>

  <p>They stood no chance against her as long as she had her wits about her.</p>

  <p>However, just as Claire had deflected the spear, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared from behind.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A ray of cyan light shot out like a delicate thread. Then, a thin chain was made out under the light. It was the Heart-piercing Lock.</p>

  <p>If he managed to cast three chains, the battle would finally come to an end.</p>

  <p>However, Claire's speed and strength far exceeded the expectations of the Grandmaster of Heaven. In their last battle, he was left at a complete disadvantage.</p>

  <p>While the Grandmaster of Heaven tried to retreat quickly, the long spear suddenly flew to his aid.</p>

  <p>He stabbed Claire through the ribs with his sword. Just as he was about to use the first chain, Claire's body suddenly transformed.</p>

  <p>Fire spurted out from every orifice on her head. Her body erupted in flames, too. The flames soon enveloped Luo Zheng, rapidly moving him to the side.</p>

  <p>This was Claire's true form.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Element Spirit race didn't have a clear concept of life.</p>

  <p>From the moment they were born, they continued to grow in strength, devouring weaker members in the process.</p>

  <p>No one knew just how many fire spirits of the Element Spirit race Claire had devoured in her lifetime. They only knew that she was a combination of all kinds of fire energy.</p>

  <p>She had sensed the strength of the Grandmaster of Heaven's sword, so she quickly transformed into her real form to avoid the strike.</p>

  <p>However, it slipped her mind that she was carrying Luo Zheng, a human who could somehow absorb all kinds of energy.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Any flame that touched Luo Zheng was quickly absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>Claire was frustrated as she realized what was happening. However, she figured that Luo Zheng had a limit to how much he could absorb, so she decided to stay in her true form.</p>

  <p>But the next moment, she felt the speed at which Luo Zheng was frantically absorbing her flames. She panicked. If she held on to Luo Zheng, it wouldn't be long before her whole body was absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>'What the hell is with this guy?' she cried in her mind.</p>

  <p>After occupying the Xuanyuan's body, Claire had suppressed a portion of her energy.</p>

  <p>Even an Eternal Realm warrior would not be able to withstand the eruption of her energy.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was absorbing her flames as though they were harmless rays of sunshine. Unbelievable!</p>

  <p>At this point, Claire realized she had no other choice but to let go of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But by the time she loosened her grip on him, he had managed to absorb more than a third of her body!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng plummeted towards the ground, in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, more than thirty light pillars suddenly rose from the map surrounding the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>The energy of most flames was destructive, and the rising light pillars were mostly in the area symbolizing destruction. Only a very small number of light pillars were in the areas symbolizing creation and life.</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues were numb to the light pillars that came out from time to time. The man in the sacred cup was obviously different from any other creature in the past.</p>

  <p>But now, more than thirty light pillars suddenly appeared, which shocked them.</p>

  <p>"Is this man a monster?"</p>

  <p>"Is he trying to perform some miracle?"</p>

  <p>"No one has ever reached this level before!"</p>

  <p>While they were shocked, their expectations of Luo Zheng grew exponentially.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After dodging the attack of the Grandmaster of Heaven, Claire took shape again. In a flash, she reached out to grab Luo Zheng once more.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't going to let this happen. As he waved the Cyan Misty Sword, a ray of cyan light rushed towards her.</p>

  <p>Just as Claire was about to close the gap between her and Luo Zheng, the cyan light spilled into the gap, effectively blocking her way.</p>

  <p>Angry, Claire had no choice but to withdraw her hand. Quick witted, she used spatial transference and reappeared on the other side of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw this coming. Just as quickly, he shook the Cyan Misty Sword again, launching a cyan light to block Claire's way.</p>

  <p>As the two fought, Luo Zheng continued to fall to the ground at a dangerous speed.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to land, a figure poked his head out of a space fluctuation. A pair of hands suddenly emerged and plucked Luo Zheng out from the air, dragging him into the space channel.</p>

  <p>Once they saw what had happened, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were stunned for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It's Fuxi!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's expression darkened.</p>

  <p>Because of Claire, he didn't have the time to finish off the two fakes.</p>

  <p>Even so, he never expected they would take action while he was preoccupied with battling Claire.</p>

  <p>How dare they!</p>

  <p>Just a moment earlier, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had been fighting fiercely. Now, they wordlessly decided to join forces to go after Fuxi.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng in his arms, Fuxi retreated back into the space channel and flew rapidly along it.</p>

  <p>With his speed, it was impossible for any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior to chase him. Perhaps only the Chaos Ancient Gods could do that.</p>

  <p>However, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven were special. In a flash, the two of them also entered the space channel and caught up to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Tiny fire snakes burst out from Claire's hands one after another. These fire snakes had a mind of their own and rushed towards Fuxi in the space channel.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven also summoned cyan sword radiance directed at Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Sensing their theurgies quickly closing in on him, Fuxi turned around, with Luo Zheng in front of him.</p>

  <p>Click! Click! Click!</p>

  <p>The extremely sharp sword radiance and the extremely fierce fire snakes all disappeared the instant they connected with Luo Zheng's body. Fuxi smiled. He could now use Luo Zheng as a really handy protective treasure!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire didn't give up the chase. However, after a while, they realized they couldn't seem to catch up to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>In fact, it seemed as though he was getting farther and farther away!</p>

  <p>"How is he so fast?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that something is pulling him..."</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were puzzled. They both knew that despite Fuxi's incredible strength, there was no way he could travel at that speed alone. They keenly sensed that something was yanking Fuxi forward.</p>

  <p>This was true. In the space channel, a thin energy beam was wrapped around Fuxi's waist.</p>

  <p>The red energy beam was actually the shadow of Snake Goddess!</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess could extend indefinitely. Now, the Snake Goddess, who was over a hundred miles away, was dragging Fuxi forward at high speed.</p>

  <p>In front of the Snake Goddess, there was a huge light sail. In order to reach this speed, the Snake Goddess was pouring most of her shadow into the light sail. The light sail then dragged her, Fuxi and Luo Zheng to quickly escape.</p>
