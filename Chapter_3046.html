<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3046 The Depressed Flag Masters </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Flag Masters also stared at Luo Zheng, some of them fascinated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first person to have climbed over the Sword Wall and was popular among the Flag Masters.</p>

  <p>If any one of them were to have him alongside them, their team would have bright future.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a dozen Flag Masters simultaneously raised the flagpoles in their hands and flew towards the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who has just climbed over the Sword Wall needs to choose to follow a Flag Master. Join me and you will be rich and powerful!"</p>

  <p>"I am Flag Master Tang. If you choose me, no one will dare hurt you here!"</p>

  <p>"I am Flag Master..."</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters sent frantic invitations to Luo Zheng, afraid that if they were any slower, he would join another Flag Master.</p>

  <p>Harden flew down from the Sword Wall to convey a message. "Flag Master Galen has said that if anyone dares take this guy into their team, they will become his opponent. I hope you will think it over before making any decision, Flag Masters!"</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters looked concerned at this message.</p>

  <p>They had different cultivation bases. Galen was at a higher level among all of them. He also had a stronger backer.</p>

  <p>Therefore, some of these Flag Masters would reconsider if it was worth it to go against Galen and take Luo Zheng as their teammate.</p>

  <p>Harden watched the Flag Masters retreat before turning to look at Luo Zheng with a smug smile on his face. He said, "I told you. You will regret offending Flag Master Galen!"</p>

  <p>But he had barely finished talking when two Flag Masters walked up to them.</p>

  <p>One of them had a broad forehead and a large mouth, and was more than ten feet tall. He was wearing golden armor which glinted as he shouted in a rough voice, "Young man, join me. I'm Parr and I'm not afraid of Galen."</p>

  <p>The other Flag Master was a woman. She threw a sideways glance before saying, "You can join me."</p>

  <p>There were many Flag Masters. Only some were not afraid of Galen. Not only were these two not afraid of Galen, but they also considered him to be their enemy. They wouldn't take Harden's words seriously.</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters looked regretful. The moment these two Flag Masters appeared, the other Flag Masters knew that they had no chance of drawing Luo Zheng over to their sides.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng clasped his hands together as a sign of respect to the two Flag Masters and said, "Flag Masters, I am not going to join any of you."</p>

  <p>Parr, the man in the golden armor, had thought that Luo Zheng would say yes to his offer. After all, he was a picky Flag Master and would only accept warriors with potential. Now that Luo Zheng had won first place and he liked Luo Zheng so much, it was obvious that he would like to accept him as his teammate.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's answer surprised him. "You don't want to join me?" He thought for a while before adding, "Are you going to be a Flag Master yourself?"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I'm thinking of," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the other Flag Masters shifted at this revelation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was qualified to become a Flag Master since he had reached the sixth layer of the Sword Wall, something that most people wouldn't do.</p>

  <p>A Flag Master had greater authority than others and would not be restricted by any other Flag Masters. But they also had to face more trouble, including conflicts with other Flag Masters. To those present, Luo Zheng, who was at odds with Galen, should join the others to seek protection. But he was choosing to become a Flag Master himself. This was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"There used to be many people like you who hadn't reached the Other Shore Realm but became Flag Masters. But such people have been rare in recent years. You have a conflict with Galen. Aren't you afraid of death?" the female Flag Master asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied calmly, "I haven't reached the Other Shore Realm yet. But I will reach the realm in a few days."</p>

  <p>"Wow! In a few days? You sound confident!" the female Flag Master said, her eyebrows rising up as she smiled.</p>

  <p>A strange smile also appeared on the other Flag Masters' faces.</p>

  <p>No matter what age it was, crossing the Sea of Truth was difficult for a True God. But Luo Zheng made it sound like it was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Someone who could effortlessly pass through the Sea of Truth would probably be one of the talents from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. If Luo Zheng really had such talent, he wouldn't have had to struggle in this place.</p>

  <p>Parr laughed. "What else can I say? Good luck!"</p>

  <p>As they were talking, the young man in cotton clothes, who had earlier been with Luo Zheng, also climbed over the Sword Wall. He heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>It took him great effort to hang the sword on the fifth layer. And once he climbed over the wall, he looked up at Luo Zheng admiringly. Luo Zheng hadn't even lost a breath as he had climbed to the sixth layer of the Sword Wall. The young man believed that even if the Sword Wall were three times higher, Luo Zheng would still be able to scale it.</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters turned to the young man. But before they could say anything, he flew down to Parr and clasped his hands together, saying,</p>

  <p>"Uncle Parr, I made it. But I didn't come first."</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Luo Zheng, the man would have won the first place. He had promised Parr that he would be the first to climb over the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that. You have done a good job," Parr said with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters had originally wanted to invite the young man. But seeing that Parr and the young man were family, they had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>The young man glanced at Luo Zheng and advised him, "My friend, it would be absolutely the right choice to join my uncle Parr. It's difficult to become a Flag Master on your own, and you need to at least have fifty teammates. I'm afraid you can't recruit so many people in such a short time."</p>

  <p>"He's ambitious, brave, and not afraid of death. That's his choice," Parr interjected. He didn't want to force people who didn't want to join his team.</p>

  <p>But if Luo Zheng got into trouble, he didn't mind adding insult to injury.</p>

  <p>None of those who could be Flag Masters were soft-hearted.</p>

  <p>Soon, more and more people climbed over the Sword Wall. Two women followed close on the heel of the young man.</p>

  <p>They walked towards the female Flag Master who had extended an invitation to Luo Zheng. It was obvious that they knew each other well.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Elgin and Beldene were next.</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene had excellent talents in the Sword Light Palace. Here, they were only mediocre. But with the help of Luo Zheng's Sword-reading Liquid, their compatibility degree had greatly increased, and their speed was faster than that of others.</p>

  <p>Since the Flag Masters had failed to win the first four warriors, they would not want to miss the fifth and sixth warriors to climb over the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters were about to invite them when Elgin and Beldene turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I choose to be a Flag Master myself. Are you willing to join me?" Luo Zheng asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Elgin said and walked up to join Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Beldene did not hesitate either. This was not even a choice.</p>

  <p>They couldn't have come this far without Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Elgin had always been jealous of Luo Zheng, but when he had recognized the difference between him and Luo Zheng, this feeling had disappeared. He was not ungrateful, because of which he was unwilling to join any other Flag Master. He had made up his mind to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters were now depressed. The fifth and sixth warriors had finally climbed over the Sword Wall but had chosen to join Luo Zheng's team.</p>

  <p>More people climbed over the Sword Wall. On a closer look, they turned out to be more than ten disciples from the Sword Light Palace, including Faegan.</p>
