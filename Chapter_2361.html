<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng took out the five times refined pills, their fragrance filled the entire hall.</p>

  <p>Most of the members of the Eagle race had never seen magical pills before and didn't know how useful they were, but the chief had seen the effect with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the six milky white pills, his breathing became heavy as he imagined how it would be to have them in his hands.</p>

  <p>During the past few years of fighting, a lot of Royal Eagles had died.</p>

  <p>Most of the remaining ones were injured and couldn't fly anymore.</p>

  <p>Among these injured eagles were the precious golden-feather Royal Eagle and the bloody-feather Royal Eagle.</p>

  <p>These six pills alone could heal the injured eagles as well as greatly enhance their strength.</p>

  <p>"If you take me there, these are yours," Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>The chief found his proposal very tempting.</p>

  <p>Recently, the conflict between the Eagle race and the Roc race had been getting more and more serious. The chances of a fierce war breaking out between the two races were very high. The Eagle race needed these magical pills to enhance their strength before that.</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to take you there, but I don't think the other chiefs would agree to it," the chief replied after a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The Eagle race was divided into five tribes— the Eagle Castle and four other tribes.</p>

  <p>Even if the chief of the Eagle Castle agreed to Zheng's proposal, the other four might not agree.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned, wondering how to solve this dilemma.</p>

  <p>Judging from the clues he had obtained, the Heavenly Wheel Temple was probably the only place that could control the jade seal. He had no choice but to go there.</p>

  <p>He had been searching the desert for so long, but to no avail. Without the guidance of the Eagle race, it would be impossible for him to find the temple.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, he turned and looked at Nelly.</p>

  <p>With a glass of wine in her hand and a smug smile on her face, Nelly said, "Oh, it turns out that you are using these pills to entice these people to do your bidding."</p>

  <p>Nelly couldn't understand the conversation between Zheng and the chief of the Eagle race, but she managed to get the gist of it by looking at their expressions and actions.</p>

  <p>The chief of the Eagle race was obviously very interested in these healing pills, and Zheng was probably offering them to him in return for something else.</p>

  <p>Moreover, judging from Zheng's expression, she could tell that the chief of the Eagle race had not agreed to his request.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any healing pills? They must be refined pills, but it doesn't matter how many times they've been refined," Zheng said, ignoring Nelly's jab.</p>

  <p>Even if she had only one or two times refined pills, those pills would still be able to heal the injured Royal Eagles. He had no doubt that the Eagle race would agree to his request as long as he offered them more pills.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a lot of them," Nelly replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Give them to me," Zheng said, reaching out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why do I have to do as you say?" Nelly asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes darkened slightly. "Because I saved you three times!"</p>

  <p>He had saved Nelly twice in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. And in this world, he had just helped her escape from the cage. Otherwise, there was no telling what kind of fate she would have faced.</p>

  <p>"You voluntarily saved me," Nelly said, shrugging.</p>

  <p>Zheng glared at the proud expression on her face. "Don't push me."</p>

  <p>Even in the divine land, Nelly was no match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in this world, it was impossible for her to use the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Although both of them were low-rank True Gods, there was a great gap between Nelly and Zheng in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>Nelly's expression turned sullen at his words. After thinking for a while, she said firmly, "I'll give you those pills. But you have to promise me one thing— wherever you go, you must take me with you!"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible." Zheng shook his head without even thinking about it.</p>

  <p>He didn't trust Nelly, not to mention that Rachelle was also in this world.</p>

  <p>It was always a hidden danger for him to have Nelly at his side.</p>

  <p>"Then there's no need to talk," Nelly sighed softly. "Perhaps I'm no match for you, but I can instantly destroy those pills." She smiled and looked at Zheng with provocative eyes.</p>

  <p>"You!" Zheng's eyes widened in disbelief. He couldn't believe that she would stoop to such lengths to get what she wanted.</p>

  <p>At this time, Nelly suddenly said with a very serious expression, "I swear that I won't bring you any trouble. Moreover, my sister wants to kill you.</p>

  <p>If you let me come with you, I'll try persuading her into letting you off.</p>

  <p>Even if you're Mike's son, you don't have to be considered an enemy by my clan."</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Zheng's face when he heard this.</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't known Nelly for a long time, he had seen enough to know how smart she was. So why was she saying something like this?</p>

  <p>Was she really that naive?</p>

  <p>It was impossible to persuade a woman like Rachelle!</p>

  <p>Did Nelly really believe that the conflict between two great clans could be solved simply by a few words from her? Nonsense!</p>

  <p>Nelly wasn't able to convince even Zheng, let alone Rachelle.</p>

  <p>However, the serious expression on her face remained.</p>

  <p>"Promise me," she said, staring earnestly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>After thinking about it for a while, Zheng decided that it was better to just agree than to waste time arguing with her. With a slight nod, he said,</p>

  <p>"But you have to listen to me."</p>

  <p>The serious look on Nelly's face immediately turned into a look of victory. Then, with a flick of her slender finger, golden pills jumped out of her space ring one after the other.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Zheng had had countless pills, but he hadn't been able to bring them with him to the divine land. Since he had only been here for a short period of time, he didn't have many pills yet. The few pills he had in his possession had been obtained from trading with the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>However, Nelly's case was different. She was born in the divine land and had grown up in a powerful clan. The sheer number of precious pills and treasures in her space ring was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>"These are all pills that can be used to heal wounds, but their effects will be different," said Nelly.</p>

  <p>She took out hundreds of pills from her space ring, among which there were two to six times refined pills; some of the pills emitted a pungent smell while others gave off a sweet smell.</p>

  <p>They might be different in terms of medicinal effect, but all of them could restore the bodies of the eagles.</p>

  <p>After Zheng got the pills, he turned to the chief and said, "Are these pills enough to persuade the other chiefs?"</p>

  <p>Staring at the pills with a mixture of greed and shock, the chief nodded cautiously. "Yes."</p>

  <p>In order to make sure that the Eagle race kept up their end of the bargain, Zheng only handed over 15 pills to the chief and kept the rest of the pills in his space ring. Only when they reached the temple in the desert would he hand over the remaining pills to the chief.</p>

  <p>For now, all Zheng could do was wait. During this period of time, his understanding of this world broadened.</p>

  <p>This world was not very large. The boundless desert in the middle was completely filled with Heavenly Wheel Bugs; only the surrounding areas were suitable for living. And once they reached the edge, they would not be able to move forward.</p>

  <p>This confirmed Zheng's judgment that this world wasn't a space and time in the past of the divine land. It only existed within the internal space of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>And if the consummate True Gods had reached the same conclusion as him, they would probably be heading toward the Heavenly Wheel Temple right now.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was also the possibility that those consummate True Gods had already discovered and entered the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>As the jade seal had appeared after the Time Elk was killed, the ability of the jade seal was naturally related to time. The death of the consummate True God of the Sword Clan might have been because he had been affected by the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A purple light shot toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was sitting on the top of the tower of Eagle Castle, didn't even look at it. With a casual wave of his hand, he grabbed the purple light.</p>

  <p>It was a palm-sized purple fruit with a transparent hard shell on its surface. The transparent flesh inside was very sweet with a faint flavor.</p>

  <p>"Just eat it!"</p>

  <p>A voice came from above his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head and saw Nelly standing on the back of a Royal Eagle, looking down at him.</p>

  <p>With her snow-white skin and jet-black hair, she exuded infinite vitality.</p>

  <p>Her beauty would make anyone stop in their tracks.</p>

  <p>After Nelly had discovered how Zheng had become friends with the members of the Eagle race, she had begun offering them a lot of valuable things.</p>

  <p>Now, in the eyes of the members of the Eagle race, Nelly was a hundred times more generous than Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had taken out powerful divine textures from her small space ring, as well as pills and magic weapons with different uses.</p>

  <p>It hadn't taken long for the Eagle race to give Nelly certain privileges over Zheng. They even assigned a Royal Eagle to provide services specially to her.</p>

  <p>After some simple practice, Nelly had been able to control the Royal Eagle with a bamboo flute in her hand. During this period of time, she had been riding the Royal Eagle to tour around the Eagle Castle, always bringing back some strange things and food.</p>

  <p>The first person to taste the food was Zheng. It was lucky that he was not afraid of the poison, or he would have already died.</p>

  <p>"Waah!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, a crying sound came from not far away.</p>

  <p>A woman from the Eagle race was holding a boy in her arms and weeping.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow, the members of the Eagle race would gather at the Heavenly Wheel Temple. At that time, a few boys and girls would be offered up to the snake as sacrifices, which meant that the boy would be separated from his mother forever.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Nelly jumped down from the Royal Eagle and landed lightly on her feet.</p>

  <p>Then, she sat down next to Zheng and looked at the mother and son below.</p>

  <p>As she pursed her pink lips, a hint of sadness appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>The expression on her face was rare for a woman like Nelly.</p>
