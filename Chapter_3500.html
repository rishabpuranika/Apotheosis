<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3500 The New Record </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Land of Sword Grief's top warrior, Libby had also chosen a senior disciple to challenge when she first arrived. Her ranking had gone up to the 300th right after that battle.</p>

  <p>It used to be an unprecedented record.</p>

  <p>But today, this fact changed.</p>

  <p>Never did anyone imagine that Zheng could easily break that record.</p>

  <p>Some disciples even believed that if it weren't for the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, Zheng could easily challenge a second-floor disciple right away and ascend to the second floor on his first day.</p>

  <p>After Zheng left the arena, he quietly retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>All the newcomers had to challenge at least one opponent after reaching the Land of Sword Grief to gain new rankings.</p>

  <p>Many newcomers challenged each other as the rankings on the stone constantly shifted.</p>

  <p>Among these newcomers were some warriors who could fight against the low-ranking senior disciples.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Feng Ge, Milo, and Chaim were among such competent warriors.</p>

  <p>But to be cautious, they chose not to challenge any senior disciples just yet.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred people chose their own opponents and quickly carried out the one-on-one battles.</p>

  <p>The number of names on the Ranking Stone continued to grow.</p>

  <p>As expected, Chaim, Feng Ge, and Dorothy ranked between the 1, 117th and 1, 125th.</p>

  <p>But these rankings were merely temporary.</p>

  <p>If one had extraordinary talent like Milo and Chaim, they could easily make rapid progress. Surpassing the Lust World, arriving at the Desire World and carrying the new Other Shore Tokens, most especially, promoted a quick rise in the rankings.</p>

  <p>About six hours later, all the new disciples' rankings had been decided.</p>

  <p>And so the Land of Sword Grief assigned everyone to their respective training rooms based on the rankings.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the Land of Sword Grief, the warriors received their monthly salaries from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>They were no longer "disciples", but "officials" of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>So long as they made steady progress, they could become influential top warriors.</p>

  <p>As officials, they received proper compensation.</p>

  <p>Salaries were decided according to their training room numbers.</p>

  <p>The salary for the warrior of the first room was special and offered according to the second floor standards, so everyone was naturally envious of it.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng settled down in the first room, the top thirty warriors had immediately decided to exercise their right to challenge Zheng at the beginning of the next month.</p>

  <p>Although Cleon was thoroughly defeated, many people were making speculations about Zheng and believed they could take him down.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't look particularly powerful, after all.</p>

  <p>Just as the first-floor seniors did, many warriors on the second floor were already paying close attention to Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the next month, Zheng had the right to challenge them too.</p>

  <p>Now, his target was probably on the second floor, since he was already ranked first on the first floor.</p>

  <p>But who would he choose to duel?</p>

  <p>On the first day, many newcomers had settled in.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were all busy? they were either heading off to the Dragon City to get tasks or training on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Normally, disciples were regularly heading in and out of the bronze palace.</p>

  <p>And on their way, they'd take a look at the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>Rankings on the stone generally changed at the beginning of every month.</p>

  <p>As it was only in the middle of this month, most people paid particular attention to the new disciples.</p>

  <p>"What... What happened?"</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man clad in black suddenly exclaimed in front of the stone.</p>

  <p>Some of the disciples next to him didn't seem fazed by his reaction.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng's name appeared, every person who happened to pass by the stone expressed some reasonable shock and disbelief.</p>

  <p>"What? Cleon has been surpassed? This name on top isn't familiar at all!" the man continued to yell.</p>

  <p>"Well, he is a newcomer, after all," someone responded.</p>

  <p>"How is it possible? The newcomers only just arrived today. Am I blind or is something wrong with the stone?" It would be hard to believe the fact without seeing it with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>"You can consider it a mistake if you wish," said the man beside him, his lips curling strangely.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man clad in black took a moment of thought in front of the Ranking Stone before leaving. Realizing he had missed a wonderful battle, he hurried off to learn more about the story.</p>

  <p>Another three came in after him.</p>

  <p>Taking a look at the Ranking Stone, they were just as shocked as the man who came in before them.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! What happened today?"</p>

  <p>"Did we miss something?"</p>

  <p>"He's a newcomer, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>New names were only added to the Ranking Stone every ten years.</p>

  <p>Naturally, most people could tell that Zheng was a newcomer at a glance.</p>

  <p>The several disciples guarding the Ranking Stone looked uneasy.</p>

  <p>All they could do was to briefly explain the matter before sending the three guys away.</p>

  <p>It was expected that all the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief would be greatly surprised after seeing the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>Of course, Cleon was the most displeased.</p>

  <p>He wasn't in the mood to cultivate at all, that day. Instead, he stood by the door of the second training room and quietly observed all the people get amazed by the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>Someone had surpassed him beyond imagination, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of dejection.</p>

  <p>From the outside, the bronze palace's training rooms looked very small.</p>

  <p>But their interior area was as spacious as a palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't planned to stay in the Land of Sword Grief for very long, and he'd have preferred to stay in his courtyard house of the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't appropriate for him to leave so soon, as he had just arrived there, after all.</p>

  <p>After night fell, Zheng pulled out the Regal Jade chessboard and let the Regal Jade statues descend for his training.</p>

  <p>The battle with Cleon did not turn out as easy as he thought it would.</p>

  <p>While the strength of his Chaotic Source Spirits already seemed overbearing, he was still at the primary stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The gap between him and Cleon was undeniable.</p>

  <p>But Zheng could still use his Truth of Godly Way to ease the fatigue of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The endless Truth of Godly Way and the Chaotic Source Spirits formed a unique closed loop, extending the lasting time of the Chaotic Source Spirits to a great extent and easing their fatigue. The two complemented each other, doubling the power that could be produced.</p>

  <p>The next morning, two stewards of the Land of Sword Grief knocked on the newcomers' training rooms and told them to enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, one should be well-prepared to break through to the Desire World.</p>

  <p>As the stewards informed the disciples, they realized that there was one missing.</p>

  <p>When they felt confused, they discovered that this disciple was actually in the first room at the far right of the first floor, which surprised them so much.</p>
