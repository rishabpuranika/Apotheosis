<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fiona's interruption made War Emperor York completely out of patience.</p>

  <p>His face darkened as he turned furiously to War King Wind and spat,</p>

  <p>"Discipline your daughter!"</p>

  <p>But even War King Wind was clueless at what his daughter wanted to do.</p>

  <p>Fiona's figure lightly floated towards the enchanted barrier. She landed just at the edge and promptly stretched out her left arm. The bracelet on her arm vibrated before sliding off her.</p>

  <p>She lightly hooked her finger on the bracelet and held it out for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I will lend this to you," she told him.</p>

  <p>There was a collective gasp at Fiona's actions. Even Luo Zheng himself was caught off-guard.</p>

  <p>The bracelet she was offering wasn't just a mere trinket. It was a semi-divine weapon. How could she just lend it to Luo Zheng so casually?</p>

  <p>"This can greatly enhance your strength!" she said, urging Luo Zheng to accept her offer.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face when he realized how serious the princess was. "Thank you for your good intentions, but I don't think I'll need it."</p>

  <p>Fiona blinked innocently at his words. "What? Why won't you need it?"</p>

  <p>This display of tenderness made War Emperor York irate and impatient.</p>

  <p>"Little girl," he said to Fiona. "This enchanted barrier wasn't made to withstand the power of my fist, so I suggest you stand far away from us, or you'll only end up getting hurt."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, War King Wind couldn't idly sit by in the stands. He immediately rushed towards the enchanted barrier and pulled his daughter away from the chaos that was about to ensue within the arena.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was a Soul Sea Realm master, after all, and nobody knew if the enchanted barrier would hold up against his attacks. Those near the enchanted barrier were thrown into a mild panic.</p>

  <p>If the enchanted barrier failed, they were dead meat. In an instant, all divine-level talents quickly retreated from the square and put a distance of around ten thousand feet between them and the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Realm warriors and Soul Sea Realm warriors, however, remained unbothered. Their strength was enough to withstand a punch from War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York turned to Luo Zheng. "You brought this upon yourself, you brat. You only have yourself to blame for angering the York Divine Kingdom. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>His fist flashed with purple light as he hurled a punch towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In War Emperor York's mind, Luo Zheng was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>All the warriors present thought the same thing. The power of a Soul Sea Realm master was no joke, and anyone who faced one would be doomed to die.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York's strike was the first attack Luo Zheng had ever faced from a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>The punch seemed to have gathered its strength by sucking away the power of the surrounding air. Luo Zheng watched closely as his opponent's fist inched closer to his gut.</p>

  <p>He roared inwardly, 'Transfer the strength!'</p>

  <p>The thought flashed in his mind as he immediately established a connection with the entire West Dragon River just as War Emperor York's attack reached him.</p>

  <p>The punch was powerful, but Luo Zheng was able to make the connection just in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The sound was similar to a muffled explosion as War Emperor York's fist blasted through Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Even if his body is tough, that punch is really powerful! There's no way he would survive."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's even going to be anything left of him. Just how powerful is War Emperor York?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, what a pity! He is such a talented young man!"</p>

  <p>But the audience spoke too soon and they were not prepared for the scene that awaited them once the dust settled.</p>

  <p>"Am I seeing things?" someone mumbled in disbelief. The distance the spectators had retreated to was so far that even a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior had trouble seeing the warriors in the enchanted barrier clearly.</p>

  <p>But there was no mistaking it. Luo Zheng hadn't been reduced to ashes. In fact, he hadn't even moved from his spot at all.</p>

  <p>A few miles away, two mountains along the West Dragon River began to crumble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was, at the moment, trying to resist eighty percent of War Emperor York's power by funneling it to the entire West Dragon River that now roared violently as a result.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the mountain ranges surrounding the river all began to erupt ominously with a series of violent sounds, causing smoke and dust to cover the skies and the entire West Dragon River.</p>

  <p>More than twenty mountains by the side of the river collapsed simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The scene shocked Luo Zheng to the core. War Emperor York's punch contained only eighty percent of his strength, but it was enough to crumble twenty strong mountains into dust.</p>

  <p>He was simply too powerful!</p>

  <p>Good thing Luo Zheng had rerouted the force of his attack or else it would've been him who was in trouble.</p>

  <p>It was also good that his sacred weapon's physique had been enough to bear the minimum percentage that he hadn't rerouted.</p>

  <p>There was a whir and then a roaring gale, throwing everything into chaos.</p>

  <p>Everyone was caught in the billowing smoke and sudden dust storm that were the direct result of War Emperor York's attack.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, everything calmed down after a couple of lengthy minutes.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and War Emperor York remained standing within the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"I-I'm not seeing things, am I?" One of the divine-level talented spectators had his mouth open at the scene in front of him. "Tianxing Luo…</p>

  <p>He's safe and sound?"</p>

  <p>"What happened just now? Didn't the mountains by the West Dragon River just collapse? How is he fine? Tianxing seems to have inherited the little monster's ability!"</p>

  <p>"Back then, didn't the little monster also use this skill to transfer Tianxing's power to the two mountains by the West Dragon River? It seems Luo Zheng also has this power now!"</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Could it be that Luo Zheng has also acquired the little monster's power?"</p>

  <p>Nobody could be certain.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the spectators, even the Soul Sea Realm masters were stunned at the current state of things.</p>

  <p>What was going on? How did Luo Zheng do it? Since when did he figure out how to transfer power?</p>

  <p>Did he truly acquire the little monster's ability?</p>

  <p>He must have, since he used it just now!</p>

  <p>This immediately gave all of them hope.</p>

  <p>The little monster's ability had served as the hope of the Soul Sea Realm masters in one day making a breakthrough above the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng turned the little monster into an idiot, all their hopes had been dashed and Turner was unable to stand out to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But, with what they saw just now, Luo Zheng had inherited the little monster's ability, which meant there was hope for them once again.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, however, thought differently.</p>

  <p>He raised his fist, now fully intent to display the full, hundred-percent extent of his power. The little monster had previously been under his control and he benefited a lot from him. However, since it turned out that Luo Zheng had inherited the little monster's ability, then the other Soul Sea Realm masters would be the ones to utilize it while War Emperor York would be left in the dust.</p>

  <p>He had to kill Luo Zheng right here, right now. War Emperor York did not care whether or not Luo Zheng inherited the little monster's ability. All he thought about then was Zheng's quick death at his hands.</p>

  <p>"Lucien Liu! Stop that right now!" Turner shouted.</p>

  <p>"Lucien Liu, let's investigate first. What if Tianxing Luo..."</p>

  <p>War King Wind followed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, War Emperor York's attack was just too fast and his fist was already close to Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression darkened. "Do you actually think that a hundred percent of your power can take me down? You are going back on your word.</p>

  <p>How shameless!" he grumbled, forcing all the dragon scales in his body to activate.</p>

  <p>With this activation of the dragon scales, Zheng's strength wasn't that much weaker than War Emperor York's.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had the skill to transfer any attack dealt to him just like what he did earlier. Meanwhile, the force of Zheng's dragon scales and the eruption of his forceful energy and life vitality were to be taken all at once by War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Zheng's actions took War Emperor York aback especially now that the power that emanated from the young man was so terrifying.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's fist landed on him, it felt like taking on the force of an entire mountain. The punch sent War Emperor York flying and he spat out a lot of blood once he landed.</p>
