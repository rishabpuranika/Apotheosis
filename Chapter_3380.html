<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3380 The Living Puppet Chains </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah!"</p>

  <p>"An ant is biting me!"</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>Two members of the Moon Spirit race and one of the Celestial Wolf race shrieked miserably as the fearsome jaws of the ants clamped down on them.</p>

  <p>But they then froze and flopped to the ground as they died, their bodies rotting immediately.</p>

  <p>This surprised the others.</p>

  <p>The one from the Lofty Mountain race and the other from the Celestial Wolf race launched a frenzied counterattack on the ants.</p>

  <p>They could certainly kill a few ants with their strength, but it would be far from enough.</p>

  <p>The member of the Lofty Mountain race was seriously disheartened and disappointed. If he had known this would happen, he would have found an excuse to avoid all this and hide outside before the hurricane showed up.</p>

  <p>His longing for the Chaotic Source Spirits had put him here however, and now he was caught in his own trap with no chance of escape.</p>

  <p>It would be a pity to die like that.</p>

  <p>Chaim and Sally stood at the entrance to the cave, their faces grim as their situation seemed to be getting bleaker.</p>

  <p>As the ants got closer and closer, Chaim cleared his thoughts and made his mind up.</p>

  <p>He stood shielding Sally, knowing what he had to do.</p>

  <p>He was one of the best disciples in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. His strength could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>He cared little for the lives of the other races, but he could see at a glance that Sally and Luo Zheng shared an unusual relationship and so he would do whatever was necessary to protect her.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he raised his hand and activated his Other Shore Token. dozens of chains spread out along his left hand, each with thin, sharp spikes on the end.</p>

  <p>The chains slithered out and suddenly darted towards Chaim's own body.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>The chains pierced deep into his chest, cinnabar field, arms, legs, and even forehead.</p>

  <p>Once his entire body had been punctured, the chains began spreading throughout his veins, bones and internal organs, covering his whole body.</p>

  <p>The light in his eyes faded as he fell into a trance. His energy force had gone and he now looked like a dead man pierced with chains.</p>

  <p>But he was now extremely flexible and agile.</p>

  <p>He drew a long snow-white sword from his waist and floated like a terrifying ghost.</p>

  <p>"Chaim..."</p>

  <p>His aura had changed drastically. To Sally, he was no longer a living creature. He seemed more like a puppet.</p>

  <p>To any creature, he seemed like a puppet.</p>

  <p>The chains were a very rare token on the Other Shore, called the Living Puppet Chains.</p>

  <p>Chaim had practiced the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent at the same time, and so he had two Other Shore Tokens. He seldom showed the Living Puppet Chains to others.</p>

  <p>Once the Living Puppet Chains had been activated, his energy was lost and he fell unconscious. He was now in the control of the Living Puppet Chains, truly a puppet.</p>

  <p>But as a puppet, his strength could skyrocket in a matter of moments.</p>

  <p>His speed, reactions and power would be boosted considerably.</p>

  <p>There was, however, a huge drawback to the Living Puppet Chains; they would take a massive toll on the user's body. After employing them, the user would be left weak for a while and even the inner world would be greatly disrupted and disturbed.</p>

  <p>In other words, if the user failed to kill his opponent with this Other Shore Token, he would most certainly die himself.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Chaim would only use it when absolutely necessary, and right now he had no other option.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>He glided swiftly with his long sword.</p>

  <p>Even the sword he had thrust out swayed. He was as clumsy as a puppet.</p>

  <p>However, the swaying long sword was precise, cutting a flying ant in half with a single flick.</p>

  <p>The ants attacking the other races now focused their efforts towards Chaim on seeing the sharp counterattack he had produced.</p>

  <p>The chains deeply rooted in his body were closely connected to his every vein, muscle and bone.</p>

  <p>He showed incredible skill in his movement, not allowing a single ant to touch even his sleeve.</p>

  <p>With every wave of his long sword, he sliced several ants in two.</p>

  <p>Five to six hundred ants had pounced at him and in the blink of an eye, only two to three hundred were left. The ants' severed bodies lay on the ground, fluttering their broken wings uselessly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance crisscrossed.</p>

  <p>"So powerful!"</p>

  <p>"It's no wonder he ranks highest in a super force!"</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Celestial Wolf race, the Moon Spirit race and the Lofty Mountain race were all stunned by what they saw.</p>

  <p>Previously, they thought Chaim was only a little stronger than them. Alone they had no shot, but if they worked together, they might be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>However, the power Chaim now displayed was enough to kill them all.</p>

  <p>Chaim continued to kill most of the remaining ants.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>Once the crisis had been averted, the chains shuddered, slid out from his body and disappeared into his left hand.</p>

  <p>Chaim was conscious again but totally exhausted and unable to walk. Sally ran over to hold and help him.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. There may be more fierce ants coming. I'm counting on you now," Chaim said as he sat down slowly and took out some divine crystals from his body. He tried to crush them to absorb their energy, but with his strength dwindling, he could not do it.</p>

  <p>Sally saw this and assisted him.</p>

  <p>The few remaining fierce ants flew over, but they were no threat to the group.</p>

  <p>They might have been fast, but there were not many of them now. The other races were on high alert and could take care of them quite easily.</p>

  <p>"I want to go down and have a look," Sally said after she helped Chaim absorb several hundred divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was not afraid of the ants' poison, Sally was still concerned.</p>

  <p>The members of the Lofty Mountain race, the Celestial Wolf race, and the Moon Spirit race all nodded. Of course, it was not Luo Zheng they were worried about. They cared only for the Chaos Source Spirits in the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng killed those ants and did whatever was necessary to open the pillar, he would take the Chaotic Source Spirits for himself.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down together," Chaim said.</p>

  <p>He could move freely now that he had absorbed the divine crystals, but his strength had still not yet been fully restored.</p>

  <p>The three members of the other races, Sally and Chaim began making their way down. Before they entered the cave below, they heard the clangs of Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>There Luo Zheng stood. The bodies of ants piled up beside him and only a few ants were left in the air.</p>
