<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1595 Disarm </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Damon was being pulled around like a toy, hooked to multiple leashes in the hands of several people, and was screaming in rage.</p>

  <p>"You guys entered the Hall of Causality before us and took the initiative, but it doesn't look like you used your brain!</p>

  <p>Advancing in the Hall of Causality doesn't need brute force. You might be a martial artist at the Soul Sea Realm, as powerful as an ace talent and with a supreme divine weapon in your hand. But the Law of Causality contained in the supreme divine weapon you hold would still not be as strong as the rules laid down by the heavens.</p>

  <p>Reasonable use of the rules is the key. I do not know the original name of the Law of Causality contained within the long hook, so I will call it 'disarm'. Once you are hooked, you do not have the ability to resist, even if you are an ace talent! And that's because you are disarmed!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said, fixing Damon with a steady gaze.</p>

  <p>His voice wasn't loud, but everyone in the Hall of Causality could hear him clearly.</p>

  <p>When the nine people hiding in the darkness on the other side heard this, panic filled them.</p>

  <p>The ten of them had entered the Hall of Causality and had set up the Dark Law long before Luo Luo Zheng had. They had seized the initiative.</p>

  <p>But they didn't spend much time or effort observing the long hooks in their hands.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they didn't think of it on purpose; just that they were too conceited for it to have occurred to them.</p>

  <p>Of the 10 people on their side, one was an ace talent, two were descendants of Supreme Lords, and two were descendants of grand world lords. In addition to the ace talent, the four descendants were also fated to lead the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Why would such a strong group even look at a group like Luo Zheng's?</p>

  <p>So Damon suggested that Luo Zheng's group hook him to the other side and he then bring Lone over. What followed was torture: simple and crude.</p>

  <p>The only reason they dared execute such a plan was because of their full confidence in their own strength.</p>

  <p>They couldn't see what was happening amidst all the fog but they could imagine what was happening to Damon.</p>

  <p>"The guy who is talking is really interesting," Lone said, grabbing the hook and studying it. He had never thought about how strong the Law of Causality was; he only knew that this hook had the protection of the rules of the heavens and couldn't be broken. And once the hook caught someone, it would definitely bring him over.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now? Damon has not died yet. Should we save him?" another warrior asked.</p>

  <p>Lone stretched his arms and said rather helplessly, "How can I save him?</p>

  <p>If he hooks me up, I will obviously be able to kill the people on the other side."</p>

  <p>All the other martial artists fell silent. Damon's loud cry pierced everyone's ears, as if jeering at the martial artists' childishness. Whoever it was wouldn't be happy being played around with so easily.</p>

  <p>Especially not one of a group of proud and arrogant talents.</p>

  <p>Since he'd been caught, Damon was obviously the unhappiest of them all.</p>

  <p>Coleman had a complacent smile on his face. They were both ogres but he didn't have the conscience to pity his own kind.</p>

  <p>All the Illusion Points Coleman had obtained were from his own kind.</p>

  <p>He had probably killed thousands of his own kind on this trip alone.</p>

  <p>Right now, all he knew was that this guy before him wasn't his companion.</p>

  <p>"My turn!" Coleman said, throwing the long hook once again and pulling Damon towards him.</p>

  <p>The moment Damon skidded to a halt before him, another long hook shot over. Luo Luo Zheng had struck again.</p>

  <p>But there were no other hooks when Luo Luo Zheng pulled Damon up behind him.</p>

  <p>Damon was stunned. With a roar, he struck out with both palms, his impressive strength on display. He had wanted to kill all seven of them by himself. But now...</p>

  <p>Damon didn't have the time to throw the hook to pick up Lone.</p>

  <p>All he wanted was to smash this human youth's head into a pile of mud.</p>

  <p>The two palms came together, slapping each other with great force. It was powerful enough to destroy a temple!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, merely gazed at Damon and said, "It's over."</p>

  <p>Jeffrey's short figure leaped high into the air, the Buddha Curse Blade silently sweeping past Damon's neck.</p>

  <p>"Buddha said that life and death for all living things in this world will always be a cycle of reincarnation. You should be reincarnated," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile, but his eyes were flat. He then patted Damon's chest, transmitting a powerful force into Damon's body that destroyed his internal organs.</p>

  <p>He would not really be reincarnated because they were in the Illusion Battlefield. After being killed in the Hall of Causality, Damon would naturally be kicked out and would have to return to the main city to wait for his revival.</p>

  <p>A trickle of blood spurted down Damon's neck, widening as the blood flowed.</p>

  <p>The color of the blood was brown.</p>

  <p>BAM! The huge body fell to the ground before Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As his body gradually disintegrated, countless Illusion Points began to dissipate from within and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Buddha... Buddha never said that," Jeffrey said, visibly depressed. Since he cultivated in a great temple, he knew that Luo Luo Zheng was spewing a load of crap. But at the same time, he said, "Why do all these Illusion Points belong to you?"</p>

  <p>Whoever killed the opponent would be able to absorb half their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey had unleashed the most lethal blow. In comparison, Luo Luo Zheng had only sent out a single palm strike.</p>

  <p>The rule of the Illusion Battlefield determined who possessed the Illusion Points. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know why he had absorbed all the Illusion Points in Damon's body.</p>

  <p>Since Damon had had more than two million Illusion Points, Jeffrey was naturally depressed.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. There are still nine people left on the other side," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>In the third Hall of Causality, two groups of people were clashing. The difficulty had increased but the rewards were also incomparably generous.</p>

  <p>After all, those who were able to enter the Hall of Causality were martial artists who were extremely wealthy. If they could pay five million Illusion Points, they would have had at least seven million Illusion Points in their bodies. And once someone killed any one of them, they could obtain at least one million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>"This guy shouldn't be the strongest person on the other side," Janet said, staring at Damon's fading figure.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Luo Luo Zheng said, nodding and looking at the dark space before him.</p>

  <p>He took a pause before he added, "In addition to this ogre martial artist, the one who has used the Dark Law has extraordinary strength. I have a feeling there's another powerful character hidden along with him. Or this ogre martial artist wouldn't be so daring."</p>

  <p>"When he was hooked, he wanted to pull the other person over," Hailey said. "Going by that, this person should have the confidence to kill all of us!"</p>

  <p>"A person with such confidence should at least be an ace talent," Janet added.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists scowled darkly as this conclusion was reached.</p>

  <p>There were more than one hundred warriors in the entire universe who could be called ace talents and each of the 50 supreme worlds of the Illusion Battlefield only had three ace talents on an average. Some supreme worlds probably had more ace talents, and some did not even have a single one.</p>

  <p>When Janet had first entered the Hall of Causality, she had two ace talents accompanying her. And now, she was facing a third ace talent as her opponent.</p>

  <p>"How should we deal with that ace talent?" Jeffrey asked, his voice low.</p>

  <p>Even though he was powerful, he didn't have the strength to fight against an ace talent.</p>

  <p>Sensing this subtle change in the atmosphere, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and said, "Even if there is an ace talent, we can still kill him. But that ace talent has now also understood the rules of this long hook. I'm afraid they won't be hooked over by us now. What about letting them hook me over?"</p>

  <p>"What?" Jeffrey said, surprised.</p>

  <p>Everyone was clear about the power of this long hook - the "disarm" could destroy almost any power or martial skills. The only ones who could struggle free of the heavens' rules were probably the Supreme Lords. Even a world lord would probably be unable to resist if he were caught by the hook and would be bound before he knew it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood this logic. So why was he making such a suggestion?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed at Jeffrey's blank expression and said, "I am just kidding.</p>

  <p>I'm not that stupid."</p>
