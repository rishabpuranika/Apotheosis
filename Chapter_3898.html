  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The leader of a mountain stepped forward and bowed before the Snake Goddess. "Snake Goddess, why are we banned from leaving our places?"</p>

  <p>"If an enemy were to attack, all the elites of our Hot Mountain will go all out to fight. We will even be ready to give up our lives to protect our place!" Another mountain leader stepped forward, her lips set in a firm line.</p>

  <p>These leaders of the various mountains and sects were loyal to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The crisis of the Pear Hill was also their crisis.</p>

  <p>It would be a great insult to them if they couldn't stand up for it in times of danger.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked at them in silence and then at the cloudy sky.</p>

  <p>She then said, "The battle we are going to face is not something you can participate in."</p>

  <p>"Why can't we participate?"</p>

  <p>"We aren't powerful enough, but we'd be pleased if we could do our bit!"</p>

  <p>"Not even an outstanding warrior at the Holy Soul Realm like the leader of the Hot Mountain can participate?"</p>

  <p>These mountain and sect leaders were also top-level masters at the Holy Soul Realm. If they couldn't even participate in the battle, what kind of enemy would the Pear Hill have to meet this time?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shook her head and said, "Even Fuxi and I can't protect ourselves in the battle that is to come."</p>

  <p>The leaders froze at these words.</p>

  <p>The people of the Pear Hill had immense confidence in the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. The reason why the Pear Hill had stood there for so many years was because of these two people.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were powerful, but if the Pear Hill could come together, these two races might not be able to defeat them.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Goddess was telling them that even she and Fuxi couldn't be sure of the fate they were about to meet in the coming battle. This was truly inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"What kind of powerful existence in the Source World can make it difficult for you to protect yourself?" the leader of the Hot Mountain asked. .</p>

  <p>"Are they the Chaos Ancient Gods?" the leader of the Witching Mountain pitched in. .</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded. "Yes, but also creatures that are stronger than them."</p>

  <p>"Stronger than the Chaos Ancient Gods!"</p>

  <p>"How could such creatures exist in the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The many leaders of the mountains and the sects were stunned as the Snake Goddess told them that Other Shore creatures could descend to the Source World.</p>

  <p>This was not a secret, and there was no need for her to hide it from her subordinates.</p>

  <p>The mountain leaders remained silent for a moment, shocked to hear that the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had descended to the Source World.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Witching Mountain said, "Even if we are really mosquitoes in the grand scheme of things, we still have to contribute what little power we have."</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Even if we die, we want to die a worthy death!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The clamor began to rise but the Snake Goddess raised her hand to silence them all, exercising her absolute authority over them. .</p>

  <p>"There is a way you can contribute your power while you are in the Pear Hill. The Cloud Cover Array can absorb your power," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"What if it absorbs all of our power?"</p>

  <p>"There are so many of us and so many different kinds of power. Can the array make full use of our power?"</p>

  <p>"The Cloud Cover Array couldn't really achieve that, could it?"</p>

  <p>If so many different kinds of power were gathered together, it would be in what felt like a violent flame. Not being careful would result in one being hurt by their own power.</p>

  <p>"The Cloud Cover Array can't do it, but someone else can," the Snake Goddess said. "She needs your power."</p>

  <p>The leaders frowned at this. But their eyes soon lit up as they realized what it meant.</p>

  <p>These powerful cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm knew many secrets of the Pear Hill. After all, the Snake Goddess hadn't really secretly trained Yan somewhere. What was more, Yan also needed a group of warriors at the Other Shore Realm and the Chaotic Source Realm to protect her when she roamed the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The secret of nurturing the Energy Shaft in Yan's body had already spread among the senior leaders.</p>

  <p>That was how they guessed almost immediately that there might be a big breakthrough in the Energy Shaft being nurtured in Yan's body.</p>

  <p>The moment the Chaos Ancient God, Gerald, entered the Pear Hill, he began to communicate with another two Chaos Ancient Gods, Kendrick and Judson.</p>

  <p>The six Chaos Ancient Gods each took charge of one kind of truth. They also had different understanding of the chaos, and a communication method at a different level, which ignored the distance.</p>

  <p>Because of the conflict between the Finale Way and the Purge Way, the Chaos Ancient Gods had been divided into two factions a long time ago.</p>

  <p>They had argued with each other in the beginning, but had ended up fighting fiercely together.</p>

  <p>At the time however, the end of the chaos had still been distant to them, so the fierce battle had not reached a point where people fought to death.</p>

  <p>Herbert dragged Gerald to the bottom of the chaos. Herbert believed that everyone was equal and everyone should let things take their own course but Judson had turned up and forced him away. The fierce battle among the Chaos Ancient Gods had thus finally stopped.</p>

  <p>It was now time they fought again.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng arrived in the Pear Hill along with the others, he settled his companions from the Oneness Sky Palace. Then, with Fuxi leading the way, he went to see his sister, Yan, whom he hadn't seen for a long time.</p>

  <p>After they had parted last time, Zheng had never seen his sister again, but had always protected her in some way or another.</p>

  <p>When Yan was on the Other Shore, all the humans she had met had taken good care of her. Since Zheng had gotten rid of all the enemies along the way on the Other Shore, there were almost no force that could act against them.</p>

  <p>As a result, Yan was able to rapidly ascend to the upper stages on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even before Feng Ge had passed the test in the Soul City, Yan had already stepped into the Soul City.</p>

  <p>In addition to the improvement in her cultivation, the biggest change in Yan was the way she used the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>Yan had been able to draw a portion of that energy in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>She had still been weak at the time. Being able to draw and transform the energy of the Evil God was already testing her limits.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Goddess's personal training, coupled with her own unique talent, pushed her into becoming more and more proficient in the use of the Energy Shaft until she could transform more and more energy.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had always been prepared. Before Yan's Energy Shaft had completely matured, she could integrate different kinds of energy into one and transform it for her own use. The Snake Goddess thus changed the Cloud Cover Array and set up positions on each mountain and sect, so that Yan could absorb the energy through these positions.</p>

  <p>Happy as she was to see her brother again, Yan told him about what she had gained during this period.</p>

  <p>"This Energy Shaft is interesting. If it can freely transform space, time and energy, and have infinite power as we're expecting, then it will be really powerful," Fuxi said, shrugging.</p>

  <p>It had been the Snake Goddess's idea to cultivate the Energy Shaft, and Fuxi hadn't thought highly of it. But what Yan had done had exceeded Fuxi's imagination.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can do it yet. The maximum amount of energy I can transform is seven hundred thousand divine megatons. I can't control the energy once it exceeds that amount," Yan said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"Is it because your body can't bear a more powerful force?" Zheng asked. .</p>

  <p>"No." Yan frowned. "The power doesn't fall on me. It is the Energy Shaft that can't bear too much power. And I don't have a way of strengthening it!"</p>

  <p>No one could tell what kind of substance the Energy Shaft in Yan's body was made of, making it impossible to strengthen it like the way she had done to the magic treasures.</p>

  <p>If the strength of the Energy Shaft couldn't be increased, Yan's limit would probably be stuck where it now was.</p>

  <p>A warrior who could control seven hundred thousand divine megatons of force could also be considered a powerful figure in the chaos. The ability had surpassed that of ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm. The potential of the Energy Shaft was probably more than that.</p>

  <p>Yan looked at her brother who had a faint smile on his face, and said, frowning, "Zheng, why are you smiling?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like there is a way to solve the Energy Shaft problem," Zheng said, his smile broadening.</p>

  <p>Yan blinked, as Fuxi stared at Zheng, gobsmacked.</p>

  <p>The information about the Energy Shaft had spread on the Other Shore for a while now. Now that Zheng suddenly looked as if he was absolutely confident of solving the problem, they were naturally confused.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that a green figure appeared above Zheng's head, and asked Yan, "Can you show me your Energy Shaft?"</p>
