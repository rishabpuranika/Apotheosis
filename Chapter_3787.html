  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was not until he left the Other Shore that Luo Zheng discovered the Blood Spirit Tortoise had projected an illusion of their fight into the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>When he awoke, Pearce and the others gathered around him. Some asked how it went, while others were more concerned about his injuries.</p>

  <p>When these powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had faced Luo Zheng in the past, they looked at him as elders looked at the younger generations. But now, there was a reverence within them that only appeared when they looked upon a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Many disciples in the Land of Sword Grief had already flown over and landed in the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>Milo, Chaim and the others were among them, all watching from afar.</p>

  <p>Those surrounding Luo Zheng were all core figures of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were not even permitted to approach him.</p>

  <p>"It hasn't been long since Luo Zheng left Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, has it?" Chaim asked as he sighed heartily. He had wondered when Luo Zheng would return to Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, but it turned out he had already reached Stage Thirty-one.</p>

  <p>The corners of Milo's mouth twitched slightly at Chaim's words and his eyes unintentionally fell on Li Bianxue. After waking Luo Zheng from the Other Shore, Li Bianxue had taken a step back from the commotion.</p>

  <p>Right now, even a genius like her could do little more than retreat to the side.</p>

  <p>She had her back to Milo and her thick straight hair fell on her thin shoulders, looking a little dejected.</p>

  <p>Milo was still a junior, but he followed a similar path to Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>If the Taiyi Heaven Palace continued to operate steadily, once Li Bianxue left the Land of Sword Grief, Milo would most likely be her replacement and the next promising talent in the land.</p>

  <p>But any light they shone was not worth mentioning with Luo Zheng around. They were like fireflies competing with the sun, and so Milo understood how Li Bianxue felt.</p>

  <p>To the southeast of the Dragon Cliff, the endless mountains and forests were shrouded in a poisonous miasma.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people, and even powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm, had no choice but to take necessary precautions when entering the mountains.</p>

  <p>But the savage alien races that lived here had adapted to it and most of them were poisonous creatures themselves anyway.</p>

  <p>This was why the people of the Bloom Divine Province did not go to the southeast. They simply guarded the Dragon Cliff to prevent the savage alien races from invading.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, a giant creature had come to this place.</p>

  <p>The savage alien races, famous for their ferocity, stopped fighting endlessly among themselves and instead aimed at this giant creature.</p>

  <p>The most ferocious race among the savage alien races led the attack.</p>

  <p>But the elites of the savage race were trampled to powder in a single step.</p>

  <p>The rest of them had never imagined such a powerful being would ever exist here. In fear, they scattered like birds and beasts and hid, observing the giant creature's movements in secret.</p>

  <p>Earlier today, they had seen two threads extending straight into the sky.</p>

  <p>A while later, the giant creature's head suddenly stretched out and smashed into the ground and the strong soul aura began dissipating.</p>

  <p>Had it died?</p>

  <p>Such a powerful being died so silently?</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit race, who lived on the back of the tortoise, were more shocked than the savage alien races.</p>

  <p>They had relied on the Blood Spirit Tortoise for generations, it also being the figure of their faith.</p>

  <p>That it would one day die had never even crossed their minds.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise's soul aura dissipated and stunned everyone still and silent. Once they came to terms with what had happened, they then began wailing and whining bitterly.</p>

  <p>They were still stuck in grief when the savage alien races lurking in the forest began making their move.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise was a powerful being whose body was full of treasures.</p>

  <p>Now that its aura was completely gone, it was obvious its soul had been destroyed. How could the ferocious savage alien races miss this opportunity?</p>

  <p>Countless creatures surged out of the poisonous miasma from all directions.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit race had no choice but to fight. Although their race was powerful, they couldn't match the savage alien races charging over like a tsunami.</p>

  <p>This time, the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attack on Luo Zheng made the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace nervous, and at the same time confused.</p>

  <p>It now seemed that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits that could summon Other Shore creatures, were indeed very important to the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>From what they knew of the Element Spirit race, they would not let this opportunity slide.</p>

  <p>They could have sent powerful warriors like Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer to fight. If these powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm joined forces, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would not be able to compete with them.</p>

  <p>But the fact was that all the Element Spirit race had done was to bring the Blood Spirit Tortoise here. Moreover, the Blood Spirit Tortoise had only used the Dragon Threads in an attempt to take Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Divine Farmer and Xuanyuan didn't have many resources to use. Either that or they had something more important to do.</p>

  <p>These were of course just the speculations of Pearce and the others.</p>

  <p>In Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, Pearce and the others had also sent a message about the Blood Spirit Tortoise to the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm from the Li Shan mountain, so those of the Holy Soul Realm could then pass the information to the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>In addition to collecting information, Pearce and the others had also gone to the star rings of the Grand Plain Stage, Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, to receive Luo Zheng in person.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned to the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Ear Mice and the members of Separate Abyss race wouldn't wait there for Luo Zheng. After the obstacle in the passage was removed, they carefully bypassed the Dragon Threads and headed straight for the top end of the cave.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue followed Luo Zheng back to the Other Shore. She carefully removed the long spear and exclaimed, "Here you are!"</p>

  <p>In the Taiyi Heaven Palace, she had already heard that Luo Zheng had managed to kill the Blood Spirit Tortoise, in large part due to the so-called Celestial Spear.</p>

  <p>With it, he had quadrupled his own strength, meaning he now possessed five to six hundred thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>This was an absolutely astronomical number for Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>It meant Luo Zheng himself needed to release more than a hundred thousand Jun of force. Li Bianxue wondered how his body was able to withstand such a terrifying amount.</p>

  <p>"We have to fly through the star ring later. Please keep it for me for the time being," requested Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue nodded obediently and put the Celestial Spear back into her Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>Before she came to the Other Shore, she had been told several times to try her best to assist Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Deep down, she was unsure of how to feel about this.</p>

  <p>She had once been the most promising prospect in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and had become a powerful warrior of the Holy Soul Realm after passing through the Soul City. But now, she had become nothing more than Luo Zheng's follower and companion, having to serve him and obey his every command.</p>

  <p>However, on second thought, she remembered that if it weren't for Luo Zheng, she wouldn't have been able to pass the Blooming Jade Stage, let alone the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>After climbing to the top of the bone cave, they arrived at the exit.</p>

  <p>Outside, on the huge round platform, were many neatly arranged star rings.</p>

  <p>Beside one of them, waited a powerful human warrior of the Holy Soul Realm.</p>
