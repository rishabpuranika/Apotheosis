<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Master Shi," Luo Luo Zheng stood and greeted him with a salute.</p>

  <p>To acknowledge Luo Zheng's greeting, Kenneth nodded and said, "I think you have heard what that man said."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," Luo Luo Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>"That man is so powerful that I dare not go against his orders, so I can do nothing but take Yan away and hand her over to him. I hope that you won't blame me for not looking out for Yan's safety, Luo Luo Zheng," Kenneth said while shaking his head as a show of extreme helplessness regarding the current situation.</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, you're thinking too much. How can I blame you for this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>He shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"While I fully support you in your vow with your loyalty to martial arts to put him to death, let me remind you that it is quite challenging to kill him... In the Central Region, there are still several people who can be paired up to fight that man, but it might be impossible to find someone to kill him," Kenneth sighed.</p>

  <p>No one in the Central Region was powerful enough to kill him?</p>

  <p>When Kenneth said this, Luo Luo Zheng was slightly surprised before he realized that the man was indeed a top strongman in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>There were distinctions between winners and losers in top strongmen's fights. But killing their opponents in these battles was a little difficult for them. After all, warriors were neither timber piles nor beasts. Aside from their exceptional strength, top strongmen were skilled at fleeing and dodging. When two top strongmen fought with each other, it was extremely hard for either of them to kill the other if anyone ever tried to escape.</p>

  <p>Other than being shocked, Luo Zheng's eyes didn't dim at the information fed to him. Shortly after, his eyes gleamed to manifest his inherent self-confidence.</p>

  <p>Seeing the young disciple still look that confident with so great willpower for fighting, Kenneth could not help but admire Luo Luo Zheng tremendously.</p>

  <p>Although Kenneth was mightier than Luo Luo Zheng, he knew not to speak out when in front of that prominent figure. Instead, he held his breath in fear, as was a common practice among warriors. The weak ones had no choice but to yield to protect themselves. If they didn't know how to measure and consider the current situation, given their weak strengths, death was inevitable.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Luo Luo Zheng the enormous disparity in strength between that man and himself, but he chose to maintain his self-confidence. It was unexpected for Kenneth to realize that Luo Luo Zheng was much more loyal to martial arts. The greater his loyalty to martial arts, the higher the likelihood for Luo Luo Zheng to achieve greater things in his career as a martial artist in the future.</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, I have yet another question," Luo Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Kenneth prodded with a firm nod.</p>

  <p>"Just say it!" he said loudly as Luo Luo Zheng hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that man's name?" Luo Luo Zheng demanded.</p>

  <p>He wanted to know who this mighty person was.</p>

  <p>"His name?" Kenneth asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>After thinking awhile, he continued, "He is known as Evil East Lord in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>But his real name is Eddie Cui!"</p>

  <p>"Evil East Lord... Eddie Cui," Luo Luo Zheng repeated that man's names several times to imprint them in his mind. Then, nodding, he said, "Master Shi, thank you for telling me this."</p>

  <p>Since Eddie had given orders to capture Yan and turn her over to him, Kenneth decided it was no longer wise to make the same excuse that Yan was training in Hell Mountain. For fear that he would be on the receiving end of Eddie's might, Kenneth had to send Yan out of Cloud Sect. As head of Cloud Sect, he also felt somewhat depressed for not being able to protect his disciple. Kenneth was helpless to do anything to save Yan.</p>

  <p>But he had to face up to realities. In terms of strength, Kenneth was far stronger than Luo Luo Zheng. And since he held a higher position, he was also far-sighted. Hence, he had a clearer understanding of how dreadful and horrible Eddie was.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had one advantage over Kenneth, and that was his youth.</p>

  <p>Since he was still very young, Luo Luo Zheng had infinite potential for further exploration. There are ups and down in every human being's life, and no one could accurately predict his or her destiny. If Luo Luo Zheng could put the Evil East Lord to death as he had sworn to do, this would be entirely dependent on his luck.</p>

  <p>To this end, the first step for Luo Luo Zheng was to take part in the subsequent test of Cloud Road. His final destiny would depend upon the achievements he would collect along Cloud Road, and if he could gain support from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>In the early morning of the following day, Yan was set to leave. As she stood on the Bluesky Parking Ground, Yan turned back from time to time while heading towards the chariot. Judging by her eyes, it was evident that she was reluctant to leave her brother Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With one foot already on the staircase extending towards the enormous flying chariot, Yan abruptly turned around, ran over to her brother and gave him a bear hug.</p>

  <p>Since she was ten years old, she and Luo Luo Zheng had been seldom together. After this separation, the two didn't know when they would meet again, or if they even would.</p>

  <p>Parting was just a matter of time. Although she was reluctant to leave, Yan finally stepped aboard the huge flying chariot, which ascended slowly towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Staring through the glass window of the huge flying chariot, Yan sat there still in a daze. On the other side of the glass, Luo Luo Zheng gently waved his hand and then assumed a pose.</p>

  <p>His posture was quite familiar to Yan, who had seen it in Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>So, naturally, Yan understood what this indicated.</p>

  <p>It meant 'I will protect you!'</p>
