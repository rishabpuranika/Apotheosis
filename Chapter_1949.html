  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sacred warrior of the Internal Elixir Realm, continued to stare at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning that emanated from Luo Zheng's body made the warrior realize that he was not to be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>The gap between their cultivation levels was enormous. Although he could not detect Luo Zheng's true strength, he was sure that Luo Zheng's cultivation level would be at least at the Spirit Supreme Realm. It was possible that he might be a world lord!</p>

  <p>'We have occupied the entire Seven Ultimate World! Despite this, he came here alone! Is he courting death?' the Sacred warrior wondered.</p>

  <p>"Who, the hell are you? What do you want? Oh, I see! You are here to surrender yourself to us!" Maybe the Sacred warrior's cultivation level wasn't very high, but he definitely had a vivid imagination. He quickly came up with the most probable reason suggesting Luo Zheng's presence.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really came to surrender, then he might still have a chance at survival. The warrior wanted to think the situation was in his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason for you to know about my intentions," Luo Luo Zheng replied coldly as he loosened his grip on the whip.</p>

  <p>The Sacred warrior was surprised with Luo Zheng's reaction. He had thought he understood Luo Zheng's intentions. 'Maybe he is too embarrassed to admit it', thought the warrior.</p>

  <p>However, his optimism was crushed with Luo Zheng's next response.</p>

  <p>"You are too weak to even spar with me," Luo Luo Zheng said, closing his eyes.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he released the pressure from his soul, spreading it across all directions.</p>

  <p>The Internal Elixir Realm warriors, noticed the commotion down below.</p>

  <p>They examined Luo Zheng's movements from a safe distance.</p>

  <p>They started to panic once they understood what Luo Luo Zheng said. They realized that situation was not in their favor and immediately turned around to escape.</p>

  <p>But just as they escaped, they felt a sudden sag as if their heads had been struck with a heavy hammer. Their heads and souls instantly burst like bubbles.</p>

  <p>The souls of Internal Elixir Realm warriors had never been trained before. They were as fragile as newborn babies and had no way to resist Luo Zheng's attack from his soul.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, the Sacred warriors escorting the human captives, suddenly turned into headless corpses and plummeted downwards.</p>

  <p>Silence filled the entire valley.</p>

  <p>All of the mortals raised their heads to look at Luo Luo Zheng with disbelief. They couldn't imagine his power.</p>

  <p>For them, Luo Luo Zheng was like a savior sent by the heavens to save the people of the Creek Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at these mortals briefly and was about to leave when he heard a voice from below, "Sir, please wait a moment!"</p>

  <p>A figure flew into the sky towards him. This person was none other than the king of the Creek Kingdom. He was at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and hence possessed the ability to fly.</p>

  <p>There were only a few people with such cultivation levels in his entire kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I am the ruler of the Creek kingdom. Since you saved us from these warriors, can you help us a little more and take my people out of the Seven Ultimate World?" The King pleaded with Luo Luo Zheng. He knew that his cultivation level was much lower than Luo Zheng's. Luo Luo Zheng already did a huge favor by saving their lives and he did not have the liberty to ask for more favors.</p>

  <p>But he was also aware that without Luo Zheng's help, they would not be able to survive in the Seven Ultimate World. The Sacred race would discover his people very easily.</p>

  <p>What was more, once the Blood Curse Technique was used, no humans in this supreme world would have a chance to live. Even if they hid in caves that were 10, 000 feet underground, they would still be affected by the Blood Curse Technique.</p>

  <p>Their only way was to get out of this supreme world.</p>

  <p>The little girl stuck her head out from the king's arms and stared innocently at Luo Luo Zheng with her deep black eyes. Her curiosity towards Luo Luo Zheng overcame her fears as she carefully measured him with her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng of course figured out what was going on in the king's mind. But he only shook his head and refused, "There are too many of you. I can't take all of you away. It is too much even for me to handle."</p>

  <p>The king looked dejected. He knew he went beyond his limit to ask for a favor. Luo Zheng's help was already a blessing for them, and they should be content with it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng's eyes cleared as he looked at the wall on the side of the valley. Gazing at the valley, he fell silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>He approached the steep mountainside and lightly tapped with his finger.</p>

  <p>Instantly, a ten-feet-high hole appeared on the wall of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's finger was like a sharp blade as it cut through the cave and continued to expand downwards. After about half a minute, he had dug out a cave that was hundreds of thousands feet wide and millions of feet deep.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng got out of the cave, he asked the king, "Do you have enough food with you?"</p>

  <p>The king immediately understood Luo Zheng's intentions and a troubled expression appeared on his face. "We have enough food, but it is pointless to hide in this cave."</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had forced their entire kingdom to migrate. Before leaving, the king had already ordered everyone to bring all the food they had with them. With the current ration, they could easily live for half a month.</p>

  <p>But what was the use of hiding in this cave? Once the Blood Curse Technique was activated, the result would be the same no matter where they hid.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng realized the king's worries. "I will not let the Blood Curse Technique affect you all. You only need to hide in this cave for a few days," he said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the king was slightly astonished.</p>

  <p>His cultivation level might be very low compared to Luo Zheng's, but that didn't necessarily mean he was a shortsighted man. After all, he was still a warrior of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The king realized that Luo Luo Zheng wanted to stop them from using the Blood Curse Technique.</p>

  <p>"You will have to trust me," Luo Luo Zheng said in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>When the king saw Luo Zheng's determination, he felt a sense of trust. 'Perhaps this young man could really do it, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your great kindness. If you help us overcome this crisis, we..."</p>

  <p>The king originally wanted to promise Luo Luo Zheng great rewards. But all of a sudden, he was doubtful if it would be enough to express his gratitude.</p>

  <p>He was an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior. Only warriors understood the gap in strength between the strong and the weak.</p>

  <p>The mortals, on the other hand, couldn't tell the difference between an Internal Elixir Realm warrior and a world lord. In their eyes, all warriors were the same.</p>

  <p>The king had vaguely guessed Luo Zheng's true strength. Since he dared to come to the Seven Ultimate World alone, he had to be a world lord or maybe even a Supreme Lord. They had no way to repay such a powerful being.</p>

  <p>"We... We don't have the capabilities to repay your kindness. We can only bow down to you and thank you for what you have done for us."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the king knelt down in front of Luo Luo Zheng and bowed to him with respect.</p>

  <p>Seeing their king bowing down before Luo Luo Zheng, the mortals below also followed suit. Hundreds of thousands of humans in a long line prostrated themselves on the ground and bowed to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely shook his head and said, "Just take your time and get into the cave. I will then shield the entrance."</p>

  <p>The king nodded and quickly gave the orders to his subjects.</p>

  <p>After everyone had entered the cave, Luo Luo Zheng used the divine textures to set up a magic array around the cave entrance. After he activated the magic array, the entrance disappeared out of sight.</p>

  <p>This magic array couldn't deceive the world lords. Even a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior could easily find the flaws in this magic array and discover the hundreds of thousands of humans inside there.</p>

  <p>However, the task of escorting these mortals was given to the Internal Elixir Realm warriors. With Luo Zheng's current strength, even a Virtual Tribulation Realm or Life and Death Realm warrior wouldn't be able to see through his magic array, let alone an Internal Elixir Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Thus, he believed that this cave was enough to keep these people safe.</p>

  <p>After he was done with his arrangements, Luo Luo Zheng left and continued on his way to the Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>The king stood at the entrance of the cave as he held the little girl in his arms and stared after Luo Zheng's disappearing figure.</p>

  <p>"Who is this man, Your Majesty?" The little girl asked in her sweet voice.</p>

  <p>The king smiled and said, "He... He is our great hero."</p>

  <p>"A great hero? Is he a very, very great one?" The girl asked, tilting her head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a very, very great one!" The king repeated and laughed.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded her head and stared in the direction that Luo Luo Zheng had disappeared for a long while without blinking. Luo Zheng's image was already engraved in her little mind.</p>
