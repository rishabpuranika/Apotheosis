  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>"Let's not argue with them!"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of pleas from the people surrounding Feng Ge. They could feel her rage, and sought valiantly to calm her down.</p>

  <p>They were familiar with how stubborn Feng Ge could be.</p>

  <p>But to fight the Bearing race here and now was reckless. She was asking for trouble! But the pleas of Feng Ge's companions fell on deaf ears.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Feng Ge launched an attack. The golden light on the surface of her soul shimmered and trembled, and instantly, the divine flames of the Sun Crow race lashed forward like a golden whip.</p>

  <p>The energy struck out at the two members of the Bearing race who stood nearest to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>They were struck forcefully by the golden whip, a crackle of energy sounding as it hit them.</p>

  <p>A bright golden light spread outward across their souls from the point of impact.</p>

  <p>If not taking measures, their souls would be completely burnt to ashes by the golden light.</p>

  <p>"Bitch!"</p>

  <p>"How dare she!"</p>

  <p>Feeling the burning in their souls from the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, the two persons who had been struck withdrew in a hurry from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Anger rose up in the soul auras of the other members of the Bearing race, and they rushed towards Feng Ge, intent on avenging their comrades.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, we'd better leave the Other Shore now!"</p>

  <p>"They outnumber us. I'm afraid we're no match for them!"</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, please withdraw from the Other Shore now!"</p>

  <p>The people around Feng Ge clamored to leave immediately, pale with fear.</p>

  <p>None dared to voice their thoughts, but inwardly they were not pleased with her. Over the years Feng Ge had always gotten them into trouble every time they accompanied her to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>These guards were elite members of the Oneness Sky Palace. As such, they were quite strong enough to deal with the forces of small races. The problem now was that they were severely overwhelmed by the sheer number of the people from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge ignored them.</p>

  <p>There was a sharp, buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's body suddenly sent out tendrils of golden light, soaring high into the air as the divine flames of the Sun Crow race turned into twelve whips all lashing forward.</p>

  <p>It was a bold, powerful move. However, these Souls of Light at Stage Thirteen wouldn't be defeated so easily.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had already lost two of their members from the Other Shore because of Feng Ge's first attack, so they were more prepared for this one.</p>

  <p>As the twelve whips swooped and slashed through the air, the members of the Bearing race jumped back from the golden strands, evading Feng Ge's attack.</p>

  <p>None of those in her line of sight could get close to her. They were focused entirely on defending themselves.</p>

  <p>But while the members of the Bearing race in front of Feng Ge captured her whole attention, their companions flanked Feng Ge, slowly surrounding her on both sides.</p>

  <p>The several men with Feng Ge quickly stood with their backs to her, forming a protective circle around her. They activated their soul theurgies to prevent the Bearing race from coming closer to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Despite this defensive stance, the people from the Bearing race still had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>On the sidelines, the members of the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race watched Feng Ge's struggles coldly.</p>

  <p>The several guards with Feng Ge soon realized that they couldn't defend her for too long. As the Bearing race pressed closer and closer, they began edging away from Feng Ge. There was no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, we can't hold them any longer. You must retreat now from the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, at this point, was entirely surrounded, and her companions couldn't protect her any more. If she didn't leave the Other Shore right this instant, she was doomed.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge was entirely focused on her attack, and didn't seem to hear what she was being told. The golden whips were becoming more and more ferocious. The members of the Bearing race who bore the brunt of the whips were getting weary as they dodged, fearful of slipping up and getting hit by the bright golden energy of the divine flames.</p>

  <p>While Feng Ge concentrated on manipulating the whips, someone came up behind her. He had a small snake wrapped around his hand. When he was near enough, he shook the little snake lightly, and it formed a circle and shot towards Feng Ge's body.</p>

  <p>Too late, Feng Ge noticed the movements behind her, and she turned around.</p>

  <p>Seeing the snake, her face changed.</p>

  <p>Instantly, she realized her danger and decided to use the Illusion Breaking Rune to escape the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>She recited the spell, and her body blurred. The man who had thrown the snake quickly stepped forward, shaking his hand once more, and a blue thread was released. The Soul Binding Thread rose and floated over Feng Ge's body.</p>

  <p>Her spell failed. She couldn't leave when she was held by the Soul Binding Thread.</p>

  <p>The little snake hissed and moved, enclosing her in the trap completely.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was stunned as her soul force froze. She couldn't launch any further attacks. The golden light faded as the divine flames were extinguished.</p>

  <p>The man who had defeated her was named Haider. Seeing her predicament, he sneered, "I can't tell if you are very brave, very foolish, or perhaps both!</p>

  <p>How dare you pick a fight with us when you are so obviously outnumbered?"</p>

  <p>"What a hot-tempered woman! I like her spirit!"</p>

  <p>"Look, she's still trying to escape Haider's Dragon Snake Trap! She's crazy!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race jeered and laughed at Feng Ge as she struggled desperately to break loose. But the longer the little snake held her, the more her soul force weakened. She was utterly unable to escape from the trap.</p>

  <p>Haider motioned with his hand, tugging at the snake, and Feng Ge was dragged to his side. He lifted her up easily.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's guards had also been surrounded by members of the Bearing race, but they shouted loudly when they saw Feng Ge tied and lifted.</p>

  <p>"Let go of Princess Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know who she is? How dare you treat her this way!"</p>

  <p>Haider glanced at them and then smirked at Feng Ge. She glared at him.</p>

  <p>"Let go of me right now, or you will regret it!" Feng Ge threatened.</p>

  <p>But the people of the Bearing race were not afraid of the Oneness Sky Palace at all, especially Haider, for even among his own people he was powerful, and he held a high position in the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Thus, Haider merely snorted at Feng Ge's outburst. "You hold some sort of unusual position at the Oneness Sky Palace, don't you? Seems like you're an important person. How unfortunate that you met me. If someone else had caught you, you might have a better chance of succeeding with your threats."</p>

  <p>Before Feng Ge could reply, he tossed her in the air, and caught her again, chuckling to himself.</p>

  <p>He moved to hand her over to one of the other members of the Bearing race. "Take her to our stronghold. Let the Oneness Sky Palace know that we will return her in exchange for soul pills. Then our costs today will be offset," Haider instructed. He chuckled again, imagining the reaction of the leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace to his demands.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's face was flushed. She had never been humiliated like this before.</p>

  <p>Held in the Dragon Snake Trap, she closed her eyes, focusing on amassing her remaining strength. Faint golden lights flickered on the surface of her soul.</p>

  <p>But each flash and flicker of the golden light was absorbed by the snake, leaving no trace behind. The Dragon Snake Trap was too powerful for her.</p>

  <p>She had no chance of escaping.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race were about to take Feng Ge away when over a dozen people suddenly rushed towards them.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>The newcomers ran up to the Bearing race, blocking their way.</p>

  <p>They were from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace did not always act in unison. For instance, after hearing about the Grand Sky Temple, Feng Ge had taken a few of the elite members of the Phoenix Palace and gone alone to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Other mountains, like the Bright Mountain, had also heard the news. Chaim from the Bright Mountain quickly organized his own group and led them to the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Chaim was the man who had shouted. He and his companions had been astonished to reach the Grand Sky Temple and witness Feng Ge being carried away by the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Against outsiders, the people of the seven different mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace always presented a united front. Moreover, Feng Ge held a unique and important position, so Chaim was duty-bound to try and stop the Bearing race from abducting her.</p>

  <p>"Ah, more people from the Oneness Sky Palace, I see," said Haider in a bored voice. He was clearly not afraid of the newcomers.</p>

  <p>Chaim let the others block the way of those who had Feng Ge. Correctly identifying Haider as the leader of the Bearing race contingent, Chaim walked up to him and said, "Sir, Princess Feng Ge is the favorite daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. You are inviting trouble by trying to take her away like this."</p>

  <p>That caught Haider's interest. But his arrogant expression remained.</p>

  <p>Sneering, he said, "So that's the reason everyone says she's important. I have miscalculated. If she's the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, then I should ask for an even greater ransom!"</p>

  <p>Haider had been born into one of the most influential clans in the Bearing race, and was himself a relative of Yellow Thearch. He was completely unimpressed by Feng Ge's status as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it's a shame for the Bearing race to kidnap Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter for ransom?" Chaim asked.</p>

  <p>Haider's face turned cold. "Don't you think it's wrong for this girl to provoke us, start a fight, and almost kill two of us? You should be glad her only punishment is to be held for ransom. She will not be harmed. And if you doubt my story, there are people here from races apart from the Bearing race who witnessed the whole thing."</p>

  <p>Chaim paused. He did agree that Feng Ge was in the wrong. It would not work to try and make Haider feel guilty or ashamed. Being a clever man, Chaim quickly switched tactics.</p>

  <p>"So you are definitely not going to let her go?" Chaim asked.</p>

  <p>"She stays with us," said Haider, in a tone that brooked no argument.</p>

  <p>Chaim tilted his head, giving him a thoughtful look. "Like everyone else here, you came for the Grand Sky Temple, didn't you? Wouldn't it be prudent to make sure no one gets in your way after the gate to the temple is opened?</p>

  <p>After all, your ultimate goal here is the Grand Sky Temple. If we try to make things difficult for you, it would put a wrench in your plans. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>This time, Chaim's veiled threat worked. Haider's face darkened, and his aura became ice cold.</p>
