<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Monica speak about it so cautiously, Zheng asked, "Are the truth swordsmanship manuals on the third floor extremely expensive?"</p>

  <p>Monica nodded and replied, "Apart from a few Alliance Chiefs, no Flag Master dares to go to the third floor. The high price is the main deterrent.</p>

  <p>Besides, the manuals on the third floor are called the supreme swordsmanship manuals, which have strict requirements for the compatibility level of Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"What? They have requirements for the compatibility level of Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng was surprised to learn this.</p>

  <p>"That's right. It's believed that those supreme swordsmanship manuals require a compatibility level of at least 80 percent or 90 percent and some even require a perfect compatibility level of 100 percent," explained Monica.</p>

  <p>She thought Zheng would choose a truth swordsmanship manual from the second floor. There was no need for him to consider the manuals on the third floor now.</p>

  <p>If one's compatibility level was not enough, they could take the Sword-reading Liquid regularly in order to practice the supreme swordsmanship manuals. However, a bottle of Sword-reading Liquid cost ten to twenty thousand divine crystals. Taking the Sword-reading Liquid regularly would be a very expensive affair.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was capable of Instant Enlightenment, he had an almost perfect compatibility level with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. So that was not a problem for him. As for the price... That wouldn't be a problem, either. His interest in the third floor was very strong now.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to go to the third floor and have a look," Zheng announced, looking at the stairs not far away.</p>

  <p>Monica was speechless. All she could say was, "All right, then let's go up and have a look."</p>

  <p>With Monica leading the way, they proceeded upstairs to the third floor.</p>

  <p>The space on the third floor was obviously much smaller than that on the first or second floor. From the moment they stepped onto that floor, they could feel waves of energy under their feet.</p>

  <p>The stairway behind Zheng and Monica had completely disappeared now.</p>

  <p>They had entered another space.</p>

  <p>This space was filled with a dozen light columns that soared up to the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at them and spotted books with faintly golden covers inside the light columns.</p>

  <p>'Those must be the supreme swordsmanship manuals that Monica mentioned, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City, located at the foot of the Oneness Mountain, was a part of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, the supreme swordsmanship manuals here were extremely important, so rigid protective measures were in place to ensure their safety.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a faint voice was heard, "Follow the patterns under your feet. If you take one wrong step, you will be smashed to pieces by the Swords Lightning Killing Array."</p>

  <p>This was Monica's first time on the third floor. She was not nervous when she entered the illusion on the third floor. However, after hearing this grim warning, she could vaguely sense the killing intent hidden in this space, and her heart trembled.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, remained calm. The patterns beneath his feet were one foot wide. He followed the patterns easily and headed straight for the first light column.</p>

  <p>When he approached the first light column, the voice sounded again. "The Sword Texture Technique sells for three million divine crystals."</p>

  <p>Monica smiled wryly when she heard the price.</p>

  <p>Perhaps only a handful of the richest Alliance Chiefs could afford to spend three million divine crystals. Even if powerful Flag Masters like Monica, Parr, Galen and the like, pooled their wealth together, it still wouldn't be enough.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. Sword Texture Technique... What's so special about this supreme swordsmanship manual?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>The owner of the voice patiently began explaining, "The Sword Texture Technique is actually two theurgies. One is the Vision Theurgy, and the other is the Swordsmanship Theurgy. With these theurgies, one can look through every flaw in the world. As long as one can see the flaws, they can destroy them with one strike."</p>

  <p>"Oh really? If I master the Sword Texture Technique, can I slash that red stone on the square into pieces?" Zheng's interest was piqued.</p>

  <p>This question baffled the man for a moment, but he chuckled and said, "If you're strong enough, of course you can. But with your current cultivation level, even if you really master the Sword Texture Technique, you won't be able to see through the flaws in the red stone."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly. The Sword Texture Technique sounded good, and the price was not a problem for him. However, it required a high level of cultivation, which was a criteria he obviously did not meet.</p>

  <p>So he followed the patterns on the floor and continued his 'shopping expedition'. As he wandered about, the voice chuckled and said, "Boy, I have to remind you about one thing. My time is very precious. If you're only planning to look and not buy anything, please leave now. If you don't buy any of the thirteen supreme swordsmanship manuals here after you inquire about all of them, I will let you go only after you pay me a million divine crystals."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I didn't know there was such a rule."</p>

  <p>Monica's face turned pale.</p>

  <p>She knew that the guard on the third floor of the Truth Library had a very bad temper, but she didn't expect him to make things so difficult. Just looking at the manuals would cost them a million divine crystals if they chose not to buy any. No one could afford such an expensive tour.</p>

  <p>When she remembered how angry an Alliance Chief had been after he returned from the third floor, it suddenly occurred to her what might have happened to him. Clearly, it was not that easy to get into the third floor.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, let's leave," Monica suggested timidly.</p>

  <p>She could hardly imagine that Zheng was capable of taking out a million divine crystals at one time. If they were to really get trapped in here, it would be troublesome.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Zheng took a step forward and continued walking towards another light column. He did not seem worried at all. Monica had no choice but to bite the bullet and follow him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng got close to the second light column, the voice boomed again,</p>

  <p>"Termination Swordsmanship, by cultivating this theurgy, you will be able to raise the power of your Other Shore Token to the maximum. It's sold for 3.5 million divine crystals."</p>

  <p>'Raise the power of the Other Shore Token to the maximum? Such a powerful supreme swordsmanship manual!' Monica thought and stared at the manual in awe.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm couldn't make full use of their Other Shore Tokens. Only by burning their Other Shore Tokens would they be able to extract all of the power in the tokens. However, they had to pay the price with their lives and suffer endlessly. They would never opt for this unless they were desperate.</p>

  <p>If she could master this supreme swordsmanship manual, she might be able to double her strength. But it was all just wishful thinking. It was for 3.5 million divine crystals! Even if she sold herself, she wouldn't get that much money.</p>

  <p>This supreme swordsmanship manual was useful, but Zheng hadn't merged with any Other Shore Token. He kept it in mind for the future when he would merge with an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>So he continued onward to the other light columns.</p>

  <p>The rest few supreme swordsmanship manuals had their own advantages and the swordsmanship they recorded was second to none. The further he went, the higher the price of the swordsmanship manuals was.</p>

  <p>When Zheng stopped at the last but one light column, he heard the voice say,</p>

  <p>"The incomplete Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, created by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Back then, the Eastern Emperor Taiyi wanted to integrate the three thousand Godly Ways into the swordsmanship so that he could master the Truth Strike, but he failed... However, the reason he failed is that the three thousand Godly Ways couldn't be fused together. It is not the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship's fault..."</p>

  <p>"The Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship?" Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed in delight.</p>

  <p>Blending the Godly Ways had once become a trend in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Some extremely talented masters tried it out but all had failed. And the Eastern Emperor Taiyi was one of them.</p>

  <p>"This incomplete swordsmanship manual is the result of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's hard work. As it is incomplete, it costs only one and a half million divine crystals," offered the voice.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's expression, Monica who was behind him gently tugged the corner of his robe and said, "Hey, you don't want to buy this one, do you? This Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship is a theurgy about blending Godly Ways. It can't even showcase the power of the Truth of Godly Way!"</p>
