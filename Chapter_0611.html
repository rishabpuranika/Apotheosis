  <p>
</p>

  <p>Considering that the Devil Phantom's essence had soul strengthening properties, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "Do you really need it now?"</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded, smiled bitterly and continued, "Cultivating the Heavenly Sword requires a really strong soul. I can hardly keep it up without a tough soul."</p>

  <p>To take advantage of the heavenly momentum, the practitioner must be able to withstand the powerful momentum of both heaven and earth in the first place, and then diverted the heavenly momentum towards his opponent through the sword. How could a practitioner deal a strong blow if he himself couldn't handle the momentum?</p>

  <p>Tianming's soul wasn't weak before, and it was at least strong enough to bear the sword, but after he stepped into the Illuminating Soul Realm, his soul couldn't handle the heavenly momentum anymore. This could all be attributed to the fact that now he was able to draw more of the vitality between heaven and earth and take advantage of even more heavenly momentum, but this also meant he needed to take on even more momentum within his soul.</p>

  <p>The accident was caused by Tianming's failure to control the gathered vitality, causing it to implode and detonate, blowing up the entire practice room where he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flashed Tianming a faint smile and said, "I'll help you ask about extracting method for the Dark Devil Phantom's essence, but I have something for you in the meantime. You can use this first." With that said, Luo Luo Zheng tapped onto his space ring and promptly took out a red treasure chest.</p>

  <p>Tianming's face lit up like a Christmas tree when he heard that Luo Luo Zheng would inquire about the purification process. Since Luo Luo Zheng had narrowly escaped from the flood dragon's jaws, Tianming also realized that the mysterious disciple from the Cloud Hall also survived. Luo Luo Zheng didn't tell him who the disciple was, and Tianming dared not ask.</p>

  <p>He was about to thank Luo Luo Zheng when he saw a delicate red treasure chest appear on the palm of Luo Zheng's hand. "What is it?" he asked, his eyes full of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Go on, open it! Then you'll know," Luo Luo Zheng chuckled, deliberately maintaining the suspense.</p>

  <p>With gusto, Tianming opened the chest. The very next second, some kind of black matter shot towards the middle of his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Like Luo Zheng's first time, Tianming reflexively tried to dodge, but failed spectacularly, so the black soul essence stuck to him.</p>

  <p>Feeling no ill intent from the black matter, Tianming closed his eyes and accepted the nourishment for his soul. It felt incredibly comfortable as if his soul was being caressed by a pair of soft invisible hands. To his amazement, his soul grew stronger at an alarming rate!</p>

  <p>When Tianming opened his eyes again, his eyes could see so clearly. "It's..</p>

  <p>Oh my god.. Luo Luo Zheng, it's some kind of soul enhancer!" Tianming exclaimed with an excited look.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a huge grin on his face as he nodded and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden display of generosity embarrassed Tianming. Tianming, who was badly in need of soul strengthening, and was a proud man by nature, was at a loss for words when he found himself owing Luo Luo Zheng big time.</p>

  <p>"It's just one of the treasure chests that I found on the Cloud Road. That is the soul essence that was extracted from the Devil Phantom's essence..." Luo Luo Zheng tried to ease Tianming's discomfort. "Don't look at me like that. It's not that valuable," Luo Luo Zheng emphasized while looking at Tianming with amusement on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still had several red treasure chests just like this one, and he had not used them yet. So, giving Tianming one of these chests wasn't that much of a loss.</p>

  <p>But Tianming thought differently. Having accepted the chest, he took this as a big favor to him. In fact, the elite disciples of Cloud Hall who watched them thought the same. Their faces were various looks of admiration. Luo Luo Zheng had just become the richest man in their hearts. They all wanted to come over and form friendships with Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>The elite disciples in the room all came from good families. As members of the Central Region, the worst of their families was at grade two, whose power was comparable to Cloud Sect. However, they were all reluctant to give away treasures like soul essence.</p>

  <p>"Well, we're from the same sect, so forget about it," Luo Luo Zheng gently muttered.</p>

  <p>Right then and there, he heard a soft, sweet voice. "Hey! You've been at the Cloud Hall for several days, but you haven't even contacted me!" whined the voice. "It was because of me that you got a purple Cloud Hall Token, and you haven't even showed me a shred of gratitude! How insufferable you are!"</p>

  <p>Tia had given Luo Luo Zheng a message token, so they could communicate without even a message rune. Luo Luo Zheng, however, was taken aback when Tia's voice suddenly spoke in his ear.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng should have thanked Tia, not only because of the purple Cloud Hall Token, but because he hadn't encountered any difficulties yet since he came to the Cloud Hall. He could practice to his heart's content thanks to her!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a really hard time when he first entered the Cloud Sect. Now the treatment he received in the Cloud Hall was drastically different from then, and most of the people here showed him respect.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me why I should show you my gratitude? I haven't forgotten that I should have a half share of the Heavenly Fruit Tree. Besides, there are a lot of things that actually belong to me, but I haven't received them yet. So who should I really be thanking?" Luo Luo Zheng passed on his words via the message token using a small amount of his life vitality.</p>

  <p>"You call yourself a man? How can you be so evil? Besides, your present realm is just too low, and it's certainly not the right time for you to devour the Heavenly Fruit. Just keep trying to improve your strength, but.. It's too boring cultivating in the practice room, so I'll give you a great present, hee hee..." Tia laughed.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tia's laughter, Luo Luo Zheng found her voice so horrifying that it almost turned his blood to ice. He had a terrible feeling about what was coming next.</p>
