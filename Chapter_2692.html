  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm was a cultivation realm, and it especially referred to the creatures that had stepped onto the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The strength of two Other Shore Realm warriors could be quite different.</p>

  <p>Being a Yellow Emperor Guard, Hamish was considered a powerful person in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But in Timotheus's and Emily's eyes, his ability was nothing.</p>

  <p>Hamish felt strange about Timotheus' words? he stared at him and asked, "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Emily smiled faintly and answered on Timotheus' behalf, "Chiyou built the divine land, and Timotheus, a member of the Nine Li race, is a five-star Nine Li Guard. Don't you find it too naive to think you can trade with the divine land?"</p>

  <p>The words changed the faces of Hamish, Nicholas, and Murphy dramatically.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how Luo Zheng managed to invite these mighty warriors.</p>

  <p>Because they couldn't deal with the warriors, they intended to instead sacrifice their interest in the divine land to bribe them.</p>

  <p id="top_23">It was a last resort, but much to their surprise, the old man before them was a member of the Nine Li race and a Nine Li Guard.</p>

  <p>Timotheus' face was solemn as he said in a deeply stern voice, "The divine land belongs to my clan. If you are smart enough to leave quickly, I will let you go without killing you."</p>

  <p>Now, Timotheus and Emily had fully expressed their stands? there was no room to maneuver.</p>

  <p>The wisps of souls of Murphy, Hamish, and Nicholas grew silent.</p>

  <p>Even Hamlin felt dejected at the moment. It seemed that the people there were truly hostile and he feared for his own survival.</p>

  <p>"What if we don't leave?" Hamish asked.</p>

  <p>A glint flashed in Timotheus' eyes before he shook his burly body and picked up Hamlin into the air.</p>

  <p>An irresistible force then enveloped Hamlin, containing immense power from the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Having been bound by Emily, there was no way for Hamlin to resist Timotheus' attack.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Hamlin could feel the irresistible force pouring into every part of his body in an instant right as he exploded.</p>

  <p>His bones began breaking.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With an explosive sound, his body turned into fine powder.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to leave, this is what you will end up with," Timotheus announced grimly.</p>

  <p>His blow killed Hamlin, a Holy Being, so easily.</p>

  <p>But when Hamlin's body was completely crushed, a strange dot of light appeared in his belly. With a flash, the dot fled from the space atop the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>From beside them, Ramzi saw the dot flee as a strange color filled his expression. He moved to the back of the dot while rapidly making several palm marks in an attempt to stop it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The palm marks turned into circles of dark-green runes? they continued covering the dot, but they failed to block it.</p>

  <p>In spite of his attempts, Ramzi could only watch as the dot fled and entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary True God's body was broken into pieces, their inner world directly collapsed, leaving their soul for death. In this case, their death became absolute.</p>

  <p>But after a Holy Being built their own universe, it became one with the divine land. So long as the universe was intact, they wouldn't be totally dead.</p>

  <p>There were only two methods to kill a Holy Being. One was to destroy them and their universe simultaneously, and the other was to break their connection to the universe while they were killed.</p>

  <p>Ramzi was trying to cut off Hamlin's connection to his universe, but his attempts failed.</p>

  <p>He didn't have enough power to deal with Chiyou's design.</p>

  <p>The only person who was powerful enough to do so in the divine land was Lorena.</p>

  <p>Such was why she had managed to kill several Holy Beings with the Lethal Fire Magma underground.</p>

  <p>"Good, let's wait and see if this day will come," Hamish's soul said with a sinister smile before it exploded and dissipated into the colorful halo.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nicholas' and Murphy's souls burst as well.</p>

  <p>Timotheus maintained his posture after crushing Hamlin. After gradually calming down, he said to Emily, "Since they sent someone to inquire about our stand, we could kill him directly. Why did you have to mention Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Ramzi flew back. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he said, "We shouldn't have sent Luo Zheng into the divine land through the space tunnel in the Holy Being's universe. They must have found us along this space tunnel? it puts Luo Zheng at an extreme disadvantage."</p>

  <p>They still couldn't enter the divine land? once Luo Zheng was in danger, they'd be unable to help him.</p>

  <p>Emily smiled faintly. "Since you've put so much of your hope in Luo Zheng, if he can't overcome even such difficulties, how do you expect him to return to the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Those are two different matters. Even if you want to train him, there's no need to have him directly face the masters at the Other Shore Realm,"</p>

  <p>Timotheus returned.</p>

  <p>"Clearly, they belong to the same matter. Moreover?" Emily looked down at the divine land under her feet. Colorful rays of light spread out in her view, her gaze reaching infinitely far.</p>

  <p>It was as though she could see Luo Zheng in the divine land right at this moment like everything was in her control. "Moreover, since I could send Luo Zheng in, I can also get him out!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Swirl Forest, Luo Zheng was sitting still on an emerald green lake as he silently circulated the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum in his inner world collided fiercely.</p>

  <p>Such was the greatest trouble brought by Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>It was no easy feat blending hundreds of Divine Dao perfectly.</p>

  <p>Once one of the Divine Dao had changed, the original Ways-blending Energy became extremely unstable. One could imagine what a disaster would come about if unstable Ways-blending Energy burst in the inner world.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Luo Zheng needed to integrate all the Ways-blending Energy once more after reaching the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>"It's too troublesome. Each time you absorb one Divine Dao, you need to integrate this again. It's too inefficient? it won't do you any good even after you merge all of them in the end. To achieve the Divine Dao Great Unity is merely wishful thinking." No. 9527 conveyed its consciousness to Luo Zheng's mind. It had long despised the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>"It remains important to me at this stage," Luo Zheng simply replied.</p>

  <p>The power of mixing Ways-blending Energy and the Emotion Closing Divine Dao was not to be underestimated. In fact, it was enough to act as his trump card. All that mattered was that he believed his father's arrangement must have some sort of hidden meaning, so he had no intention of giving up.</p>
