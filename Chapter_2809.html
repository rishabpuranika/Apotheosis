<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2809 The Spear Of Supreme Harmony </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Zheng replied flatly.</p>

  <p>Samuel wanted to explain, but the woman had already manipulated the Holy Beings' clones to circle and surround him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the woman also commented, "Whatever your reason, now you have to cut off the connection between those two girls with the spear that Zheng mentioned."</p>

  <p>Her tone sounded like she was giving an order, telling Samuel that as long as he said "no", he would definitely suffer the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, better do as she says," Nicholas suggested.</p>

  <p>Zheng had revealed some of Samuel's secrets to him before. It seemed like Samuel could check his memories. He had doubts about Samuel, but along the way, he had no time to investigate about it.</p>

  <p>Choosing to believe Zheng in this matter, even if the woman didn't plan to start a fight, Nicholas would force Samuel.</p>

  <p>Hearing what the woman had said, the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans all stared at Samuel. The woman led a group of Holy Beings' clones to surround him with a fiendish look.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, why do you prefer to trust a junior? Can't you see he's trying to put a wall between us? I don't have that spear!" Samuel retorted.</p>

  <p>"We can just ask your clone whether you have the spear or not," Zheng suggested with a smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing his suggestion, the woman patted her forehead.</p>

  <p>She was so anxious just now that she forgot about Samuel's clone.</p>

  <p>Shifting her eyes to Samuel's clone, who was standing not far away from her, she watched carefully how the clone tapped his thumb. A light flashed from his space ring as the Spear of Supreme Harmony appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Spear of Supreme Harmony gave off the abstruse internal momentum of the Space Law, making the Holy Beings' eyes flash when they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region had suppressed all of the Space Laws. This spear could have a powerful effect in this place.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, Samuel, you are really hiding something from me." Nicholas laughed coldly. "I didn't expect you to have such a powerful weapon in your possession," he added as coldness appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although his lie was exposed, Samuel still remained calm and answered,</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, you have misunderstood. I gained the Spear of Supreme Harmony by chance."</p>

  <p>"Since we are in trouble right now, please help us," Nicholas requested, squinting at Samuel.</p>

  <p>Although Samuel's clone also had the Spear of Supreme Harmony with him, Nicholas was forcing Samuel to do it personally.</p>

  <p>Obviously, if Samuel rejected, he would immediately need to fight Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Samuel as he bowed his head.</p>

  <p>And then he quietly glanced over at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Noticing Samuel's bloodthirsty expression, Zheng just smiled indifferently.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't tell the truth about Samuel's real identity because he had taken the interests of the whole into account. If Samuel's identity was revealed now, Nicholas would sure want to fight with him immediately.</p>

  <p>Now that their group was being hunted by two girls, Zheng also didn't want to provoke an internal strife.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the void was boundless. The energy of the two girls, one red-eyed and one blue-eyed, seemed to be inexhaustible. At the moment, red lotuses and ice flowers covered hundreds of miles in the void.</p>

  <p>The two girls distanced themselves from each other, a blue thin line connecting them.</p>

  <p>As Samuel concentrated on activating the Spear of Supreme Harmony, he squinted and vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>With the use of this spear, he could choose to show up in any space at will, while the other Holy Beings needed to create, cross and leave the space channel when using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>These three steps still took a while even though the Holy Beings seemed to only need an instant to display the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Samuel had disappeared, everyone looked in the distance, hoping he would cut the line off.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>However, Samuel didn't act like he was expected to.</p>

  <p>Instead, he appeared in front of the red eyed girl.</p>

  <p>"Little girl, you can't get your food, right?" Samuel asked her kindly.</p>

  <p>Confused with Samuel's question, the girl stared back at him and answered,</p>

  <p>"They are all running. Are you willing to serve as my food?"</p>

  <p>"No," Samuel said, shaking his head. "I just want to help you."</p>

  <p>With that, he thrust his Spear of Supreme Harmony at the girl.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He surely knew that he couldn't kill her, so that was not his intention.</p>

  <p>The Spear of Supreme Harmony was a magic spear that could control space.</p>

  <p>Piercing through the air, the spear created a big hole and swallowed the red eyed girl in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The moment the red eyed girl got swallowed, another hole appeared beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>The red light glowed from the hole, Zheng felt her hot breath coming at his face.</p>

  <p>It turned out that Samuel had created a space channel, sending the red-eyed girl to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Some red lotuses blossomed around the little girl, one after another.</p>

  <p>Initially there were only ten red lotuses.</p>

  <p>After a while, it blossomed to a hundred red lotuses.</p>

  <p>Zheng lost count as countless red lotuses blossomed in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>After putting away his weapon, Sword Chen drew a thin line in the void and then flew backward at full speed.</p>

  <p>Due to fear of being surrounded by the red lotuses, the Holy Beings' clones also used their methods to leave as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was the nearest to the girl, ended up getting trapped in the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" the woman called out, her face full of fear at this scene.</p>

  <p>She wanted to rush in to save Zheng, but she was worried about the power of these red lotuses. Like the Explosive Crystals, these red lotuses emitted extremely powerful flames.</p>

  <p>She was unable to resist the flames. Even if she rushed in, Zheng would probably have already been burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>The scene had Sword Chen's face ghastly pale, while Tianming also looked worried.</p>

  <p>But then he remembered that Zheng's body was not afraid of fire. This girl's flames were so fierce that even Holy Beings couldn't resist them. He was unable to confirm whether or not Zheng could withstand them.</p>
