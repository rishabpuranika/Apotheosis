<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3259 Demand An Exorbitant Price </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though the Dark Region was extremely dangerous, the mystery about it made it all the more fascinating.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, no one had ever stepped into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light that had entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore were all elite disciples of the younger generation in each race. Perhaps it was their youthful spirit that tempted them to further explore the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, it was rather difficult to enter the Grand Sky Temple, as there was a very limited number of Other Shore Keys. One usually waited several years, or even decades, before the Grand Sky Temple opened.</p>

  <p>But there were still some keys despite the small number.</p>

  <p>In fact, a few of the creatures possessed the Other Shore Keys to the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>There was news that was spreading rapidly that there was a path from the temple that led to the Dark Region. It was most likely that those who did possess the keys had caught wind of the news by now; it was only a matter of time before someone opened the gate to enter the temple.</p>

  <p>All the Souls of Light that gathered at the gate were determined. No matter the cost, they absolutely had to break into the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>It was possible that the one who possessed a key would be willing to let them pass in exchange for soul pills. But it was also likely that they would need to fight for it.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear? Just today, the Ear Mouse race auctioned an Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple!" a nonhuman creature among the crowd suddenly announced.</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light had been waiting here for a long time now. As soon as they heard that news, they began to whisper amongst themselves excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Really? I didn't even know the Ear Mouse race had an Other Shore Key!"</p>

  <p>"I've told you so! I told you that they definitely had the key."</p>

  <p>"But why would they be stupid enough to sell the key? They could have just charged soul pills as entrance fees; that way, they could've earned so much more!"</p>

  <p>Thousands of Souls of Light were present, and each of them had hundreds of thousands of soul pills they were willing to trade to enter the temple.</p>

  <p>Moreover, more Souls of Light kept arriving. The Ear Mouse race had always been known to be intelligent. How could they have missed such an opportunity?</p>

  <p>"I don't know. A member of the Heavenly Pine race offered over sixty million soul pills, but the Ear Mouse race refused. They wanted to sell it to a human."</p>

  <p>Many creatures had witnessed what happened at the auction, and felt a bit unsettled at how the events unfolded before them.</p>

  <p>"They wanted to sell the key to a human?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, when does the human race deserve special attention from the Ear Mouse race?"</p>

  <p>The nonhuman creatures laughed.</p>

  <p>To them, this all seemed like a petty rumor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng and Dorothy found a suitable place to wait. "You can leave the Other Shore first," Luo Zheng said to her seriously. "There are too many nonhuman creatures here, who knows what might happen."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng checked the time. He had about 14 hours left. He had to leave the Other Shore now and re-enter in the form of his body. Fearing for her safety, he didn't want Dorothy to stay on the Other Shore alone.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded obediently. Just as she was about to leave the Other Shore, Luo Zheng suddenly said, "Wait."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Dorothy asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"Stretch out your hand," Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>Without asking for a reason, she immediately obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Something may be useful after we enter the temple," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Activate your space ring."</p>

  <p>A square appeared above the palm Dorothy held out. Luo Zheng also activated his, and positioned near Dorothy's.</p>

  <p>After the two squares connected, Luo Zheng stealthily transferred all the candles from his space ring to Dorothy's. Even though the knowledge about the candles wasn't widespread, he still didn't want others to see what he was doing, just in case.</p>

  <p>"These are the candles from the bottom of the sea." Dorothy's mouth hung open in shock.</p>

  <p>"Shh," Luo Zheng shushed her. "They might come in handy in the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>"Candles... You mean they might light up the Dark Region?" Dorothy's eyes twinkled with excitement.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had told Luo Zheng before that these candles could be useful in the Dark Region, but he hadn't told Dorothy about it.</p>

  <p>However, she was a smart girl. It wasn't hard for her to connect the dots.</p>

  <p>"It's possible." Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's mind whirled at the possibilities. If they could use these candles in the Dark Region, did this mean they could finally explore the forbidden and unknown?</p>

  <p>Dorothy safely tucked away the candles and then left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to gaze upon the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Realizing he wanted a better vantage point, he headed for higher ground.</p>

  <p>Again, he fixed his gaze towards the Grand Sky Temple. Sure enough, he found a little light shining from behind the temple.</p>

  <p>"Those are the three small huts in the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>Because he was too far away, Luo Zheng could only barely make out the faint silhouette of the three small huts.</p>

  <p>But it was enough. After confirming the existence of those huts, Luo Zheng retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Around four hours later, even more throngs of Souls of Light gathered at the gate of the temple.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! This is the territory of the Separate Abyss race!"</p>

  <p>More than a dozen of massive Souls of Light from the Separate Abyss race came to take up the space right in front of the gate.</p>

  <p>Having shoved away all the other Souls of Light, the Separate Abyss race planned to enter the temple first, if someone were to open the gate.</p>

  <p>"So what? The Separate Abyss race might be invincible in Stage Eleven, but we're in Stage Thirteen. Just who do you think you are?" Several nonhuman creatures clamored in protest.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race had always exhibited a superiority complex over other races. As a result, they had offended many super forces in the past.</p>

  <p>In Stage Eleven, the other super forces didn't dare to fight against the Separate Abyss race; it was widely known that Stage Eleven was their territory. But things were different in Stage Thirteen. Everyone's soul was roughly on the same cultivation level. If the other races worked together to attack the Separate Abyss race, they wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"You dare provoke us?" shouted a member of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>"We are not afraid of you. Are you challenging us to a fight? Right here, right now?"</p>

  <p>Just as the Souls of Light were about to strike each other angrily, a nearby Ear Mouse cleared its throat. "If anyone fights here, they will instantly be disqualified from entering the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>If it were a creature from any other race, no one would have paid it heed.</p>

  <p>But it was an Ear Mouse, and the race was known to be credible sources.</p>

  <p>After all, they were the ones who possessed the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the Souls of Light backed off quietly.</p>

  <p>"Mouse, do you really have the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple?" the member of the Separate Abyss race asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we do," the Ear Mouse said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the answer, the rest of the Souls of Light cheered. Entering the Grand Sky Temple seemed so possible now.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you open the gate to the Grand Sky Temple now?" urged the member of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>"It's not the time yet," the Ear Mouse squeaked. "We still have to wait a few hours. We are waiting for an important guest."</p>

  <p>"What important guest?"</p>

  <p>"Quit wasting our time! Just open the gate!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the light in the Dark Region would vanish soon."</p>

  <p>The nonhuman creatures at present tried to convince the Ear Mouse to open the gate to the temple.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse said unhurriedly, "If you want to enter the temple, you have to follow our rules. We won't open the gate until our important guest comes." With a sly smile, he continued, "You'd better pay the soul pills first to share the cost of the Other Shore Key."</p>

  <p>"How many soul pills does it cost?" a nonhuman creature asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"One million soul pills per Soul of Light," the Ear Mouse announced with a flourish.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the faces of the creatures that had gathered there fell.</p>

  <p>There were probably around two thousand Souls of Light gathered.</p>

  <p>If each Soul of Light needed to pay a million soul pills, it'd amount to roughly two billion in total! How could this be? The price of the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was usually only a few million.</p>

  <p>This was way too expensive!</p>
