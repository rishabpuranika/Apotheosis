<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3441 The Abstruse Energy State </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No matter how prosperous the chaos was, it was impossible to avoid the needle.</p>

  <p>All the creatures would be annihilated.</p>

  <p>This wasn't a disaster, something nobody had seen. It had, in fact, been predestined since the chaos was born.</p>

  <p>Only one thing could prevent this from happening: turning into creatures on the Other Shore and hiding there.</p>

  <p>In the long history of the chaos, each creature had the same fate.</p>

  <p>They either entered the Other Shore or they died. They could try to become the Sons of Truth but their chances were remote. Besides, they would still die after two rounds of chaos.</p>

  <p>A number of creatures and talents had tried all kinds of methods.</p>

  <p>Escaping from the chaos was the easiest and the most direct way.</p>

  <p>Countless civilizations had come into existence and declined, but no one had ever succeeded.</p>

  <p>And now, King Manard was hiding in this space to avoid death when the end arrived. He had even broken through the chaos. The shock that No. 9527 and the Green Jade Spirit felt couldn't be described in mere words.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if they believed it or not. It was an undeniable fact. They hoped Luo Zheng could explore the cave and find more.</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the enchanting woman entered the cave first, Luo Zheng following close behind.</p>

  <p>The wall of the cave was covered with a kind of dense brown material that was neither rock nor soil. Luo Zheng reached out, pressing gently on the wall and releasing the Other Shore Power within him.</p>

  <p>But there was no reaction. The material was so solid that it was almost impossible to separate it from the cave wall.</p>

  <p>The man noticed Luo Zheng's move and smiled before saying, "It's impossible to break this wall. Our master has said that no one can leave a single trace on it even if they are to use a million Jun of force."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>He remained speechless for a while before he found his voice. "How solid is this wall?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not a matter of solidity. Our master has said that this wall can never be damaged," the woman said.</p>

  <p>"Then how did your master dig through this?" Luo Zheng asked, exasperated.</p>

  <p>"He has his own ways," the man said with pride.</p>

  <p>The man and the woman never stopped talking about their master.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave up testing the strength of the cave wall and went ahead with them.</p>

  <p>The length of this cave was beyond Luo Zheng's imagination. It stretched for dozens of miles into the distance even though it wasn't that high. It didn't take him much effort to climb, but it took him four hours to reach the end of the cave.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the cave, Luo Zheng, No. 9527, and the Green Jade Spirit looked around.</p>

  <p>"Is this the world outside the chaos?"</p>

  <p>A starry sky had appeared before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The light spots, close or far, were bright blue.</p>

  <p>According to the man and the woman, this world was mysterious. But all Luo Zheng could see was an empty space filled with stars.</p>

  <p>The man laughed and said, "No. It's not like what you see. Try putting your hand out of this cave."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at him strangely before putting his hand out of the cave.</p>

  <p>A strange scene appeared.</p>

  <p>The moment his fingers left the cave, they turned into countless star lights and spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>The further Luo Zheng extended his hand, the farther away the star lights became from each other. And when he slowly withdrew his hand, all the star lights gathered at the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>The scattered star lights returned to him once he withdrew his hand.</p>

  <p>"Wow! It's so amazing!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, awed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't felt anything odd throughout. His hand had turned into star lights but he hadn't felt pain. Instead, he had felt the touch, bright and sharp.</p>

  <p>The man and woman weren't surprised at Luo Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>The woman also stretched out her hand and waved it around. At her movement, the star lights that had spread out began to dance in the air.</p>

  <p>"I'll go out and have a look," said Luo Zheng, standing up.</p>

  <p>He had just turned to leave when a voice called out to him.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The man and the woman were taken aback at Luo Zheng's actions and they made to block his path.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The man said, "My master has told me that this is the Abstruse Energy State. It's okay for some parts of your body to enter the Abstruse Energy State. But if your whole body does, you will never find a way to return. You will have to live in this state forever."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gasped at this information. The world outside the chaos was really something else.</p>

  <p>What was before him was not the void, but a special state. Substances within it were presented in a different way, and space and time had undergone unimaginable changes.</p>

  <p>"Then how can your master and the others get in?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"He has his own ways. If you really want to see what's outside, you can poke your head out and we will pull you back after five minutes," the woman suggested.</p>

  <p>The man and the woman didn't dare to enter the space outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>But they had been curious and they had used this method to observe the space.</p>

  <p>"Good idea!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, nodding. He leaned out while the man held his legs behind him.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's head emerged from the cave, it also turned into countless bright blue star lights. As more and more parts of his head emerged, the star lights began to spread quickly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't felt anything strange until this moment.</p>

  <p>As he craned his head, he felt everything go black. He couldn't see anything anymore.</p>

  <p>Instead, he felt a different kind of feeling course through him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never experienced this feeling before. In this void, everything around him had merged into nothingness. He was the only star in it.</p>

  <p>The distance became infinitely long yet remained infinitely short. No matter how vast the space was, he could touch any end of it. And no matter how short the distance was, he could not reach it.</p>

  <p>Time instantly sped up with his thoughts. Billions of years passed with one thought, but the next moment, it seemed like only an instant had passed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not describe this feeling.</p>

  <p>Just as the man and the woman had said, he couldn't see the chaos or find the cave in such a state. Even his physical sense had disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>If he was reckless and rushed in, he would probably be permanently lost in this state.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had lost all sense of time and felt like countless years had passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>As the star lights rotated, Luo Zheng was pulled back into the cave, familiar sights appearing back in front of his eyes.</p>
