<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2920 Searching For Space Fluctuations </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Following Clement's command, Godfrey gently pressed the jade plate in his hand.</p>

  <p>A bright crescent appeared on the jade plate.</p>

  <p>Soon after, an invisible wave spread out, covering a large area around them.</p>

  <p>"The Slaughtering Moonlight Array has been activated," reported Godfrey.</p>

  <p>Clement nodded leisurely. The flying ship floating in the sky slowly descended and finally landed on the peak point of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Clement jumped off the flying ship in relief and glanced around. The peak point of the divine land was actually flat, and everything within his sight was extremely desolate.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guard who jumped down right after him said, "The divine land is much larger than I imagined."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a world that Chiyou created, after all," Clement said flatly.</p>

  <p>Then, he squatted down and lightly knocked on the ground.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he suddenly leaped up into the air, conjuring up a bright scarlet rune in his hand.</p>

  <p>As he came back down, he slapped the scarlet rune hard on the ground.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The moment the scarlet rune touched the ground, a ring of scarlet light spread out from the center of his palm with a dull buzzing noise.</p>

  <p>The peak of the divine land trembled for a moment.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At that moment, a triangular shield quietly appeared on the surface of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Clement asked, frowning and staring at the shield at his feet.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful treasure! Master Clement, even you failed to break this with your full strength," Godfrey exclaimed. He couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>The other Yellow Emperor Guards could sense the power of this shield, but they shook their heads in response to Clement's question. They didn't know the origin of this treasure either.</p>

  <p>However, a relatively young Yellow Emperor Guard who was standing at the rear thought about it for a while before he said, "I heard that Chiyou had a supreme treasure? the Heavenly Mirror Shield. It is supposed to be in the shape of a triangle, and it is said that it can't be destroyed by any force in the world. Is this the Heavenly Mirror Shield?"</p>

  <p>Clement looked at this Yellow Emperor Guard in surprise and asked,</p>

  <p>"Abbas, are you sure?"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guard named Abbas nodded. "This treasure is in the shape of a triangle, and we are in the world that Chiyou created. It can't just be a coincidence."</p>

  <p>"No wonder Leyton said that we couldn't enter the divine land directly,"</p>

  <p>Clement said with a frown. "He said that there was a barrier in the space channel too. I wonder if this barrier can block us."</p>

  <p>After saying that, he took a casual step forward. As a trace of space wave materialized in front of him, he stepped into the space channel in an elegant manner.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, Clement staggered backward. He had been so confident that he had bumped into the space barrier without any precaution, making himself look awkward as he tried to regain his balance.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! The space barrier!" he cursed angrily.</p>

  <p>"It seems that it's not that easy to break through the space barrier of the divine land," said Abbas.</p>

  <p>Clement took a deep breath to calm himself down, and then said, "Leyton said that it took them more than ten years to drill just a small crack in the space barrier. It will not be easy for us to break through the barrier in a short period of time. But those Nine Li Guards arrived here a long time ago. They must have been trying to break the space barrier day and night."</p>

  <p>"If we can find them and kill them, we can just continue their work and break the space barrier. This will save us a lot of time," said Abbas. "The spot where they've been drilling must have strong space fluctuations.</p>

  <p>Although the uppermost part of the divine land is wide, it won't be difficult to find that spot."</p>

  <p>Clement nodded approvingly and cast a satisfactory glance at Abbas.</p>

  <p>Although Abbas was a mere one-star Yellow Emperor Guard whose cultivation base was the lowest among the group, he was the smartest one.</p>

  <p>Clement made a mental note to invest more resources in him and make him a powerful assistant in the future.</p>

  <p>"What we need to do is just to observe the space fluctuation ahead. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards returned to their flying ship. The ship maintained an alarmingly close distance from the surface of the divine land as it flew.</p>

  <p>All the Yellow Emperor Guards released their spiritual senses as far as possible.</p>

  <p>The further the spiritual senses spread, the slower they would be in reacting.</p>

  <p>However, since they were only trying to find space fluctuations, not people who were constantly on the move, the sensitivity of their spiritual senses was more than enough to do so.</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand miles away, Ramzi had already set up an array.</p>

  <p>It was called the Four-Spirit Hiding Array and it could hide everything from outsiders, including the breath of life and soul.</p>

  <p>Even if someone stood face to face with them, they would not be able to sense the existence of anyone hiding inside the array.</p>

  <p>The people of the Snake Goddess race, the Nine Li race, Lorena, and the Holy Beings of the divine land were all enveloped by the Four-Spirit Hiding Array.</p>

  <p>"That flying ship is approaching us," Mike said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if they are enemies or friends. But if they are enemies, I will immediately enter the divine land," Vanessa said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Moon rolled his eyes at her and said, "Since our Moon Clan has chosen this path, there is no reason for us to retreat just because we encounter difficulties. Although I might not be powerful enough, I will still try my best!"</p>

  <p>Moon was very clear about the staggering amount of difference between a Holy Being and a warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"They are coming this way! We'd better keep silent!" said a Holy Being of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Ramzi laughed. "My Four-Spirit Hiding Array can block everything, including sound. Whether they can discover us has nothing to do with the amount of noise we make. Even if you shout at them, they won't hear us."</p>

  <p>But despite Ramzi's words, everyone couldn't help holding their breath when they saw the ship coming closer and closer.</p>

  <p>It only took a moment for the Trumpet Flying Ship to cover a distance of 30, 000 miles at full speed.</p>

  <p>Even though the Yellow Emperor Guards were driving the Trumpet Flying Ship slower than usual in order to observe the space fluctuations, they still arrived in less than half a minute.</p>

  <p>Clement was sitting with his eyes closed as his spiritual sense spread out like thin threads, densely covering the entire area within a radius of thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>Space in the chaos was the most stable, even more stable than it was in the Source World. Therefore, even the slightest trace of space fluctuation would be very eye-catching.</p>

  <p>"Hm..."</p>

  <p>Clement suddenly felt a faint space fluctuation, but it disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>The moment he made a sound, Godfrey stopped the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>The others were trying to sense the space fluctuation too, but none of them had found anything.</p>

  <p>"Master Clement, did you sense the space fluctuation?" asked Godfrey.</p>

  <p>Clement looked to the left and pointed in that direction. "That way!"</p>

  <p>"That way? I see nothing..."</p>

  <p>"I didn't sense the space fluctuation either."</p>

  <p>"Master Clement's spiritual sense is stronger than ours. Maybe he can see something we can't."</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship quickly turned and moved in the direction that Clement had pointed in.</p>

  <p>When Ramzi saw the ship turn toward them, he clenched his fists, and a trace of tension finally appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Of course, they had already known that the space fluctuations were likely to reveal their position. But since they had worked so long to excavate the space barrier here, they couldn't give up. That was why Ramzi had specially set up another array to mask its position.</p>

  <p>However, it was very difficult to completely cover up the space fluctuations.</p>
