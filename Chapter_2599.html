<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2599 Exposure </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon after the Chaos Ancient God's death, most of his powers and skills were distributed among the brain masters.</p>

  <p>But the powers seemed to be wasted on those naive brain masters. They were only concerned with their inner beautiful dreams in the spiritual world and cared least about what was happening outside.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the brain units like No. 9527 showed keen interest in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the brain masters would assign their powers to the brain units like No. 9527 to fulfill certain tasks that seemed to take too much of their time.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while, some undisciplined exiles would try to break into the Chaos Ancient God's skull, but they were easily eliminated by the small brain units.</p>

  <p>Of course, like No. 9527, they too had borrowed the strength from the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The arrow with a considerable length of about 620 feet disappeared the moment it left the bowstring.</p>

  <p>According to the estimation of No. 9527, the arrow would find its target Tyler, who was hiding in the void, in a very short time.</p>

  <p>But Tyler was very proficient in the Truth of Void Destruction. There was a chance of survival for him from the arrow.</p>

  <p>However, No. 9527 didn't consider the probability that Tyler could even dodge the arrow. Tyler's life was like dust to it, and held little significance for it.</p>

  <p>What was important was to refrain Tyler from killing Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tyler, who was hiding in the void, carefully controlled David and gradually forced Luo Zheng into a corner.</p>

  <p>He felt like he was fighting Luo Zheng in person. He never imagined that Luo Zheng could be so stubborn. It took tremendous effort on his part to duel with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tyler sighed as he felt sorry for Luo Zheng. After all, Luo Zheng was his opponent now.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to end Luo Zheng's life, he suddenly felt a tremor.</p>

  <p>He solely focused on practicing the Truth of Void Destruction. Hence, he had a sharp sense of space, which was far more superior to other exiles.</p>

  <p>Even though the wave of spatial fluctuation was tens of billions of miles away, he could still sense it. What was more, he knew it headed in his direction.</p>

  <p>'It's a fluctuation that will come very soon. I think...'</p>

  <p>His pupils dilated, as he thought about the fluctuation.</p>

  <p>He barely had enough time to gauge the speed of the fluctuation. It was much faster than he had expected.</p>

  <p>Terror crept through his spine, in turn freezing his mind and thoughts.</p>

  <p>He didn't have time to think. Instinctively he twisted his body and activated the Truth of Void Destruction to eliminate the void that had helped him to hide.</p>

  <p>As soon as the void was disposed of, he immediately bounced out and stumbled in the air for a long time before he could stop himself. He felt a bit giddy with the fall.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was pushed out, a slender white form flew past him from behind.</p>

  <p>The figure had reached the vertex of its speed. In the Flying Sickle City, except for Tyler, no one really saw it clearly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the white figure flew into the void again and disappeared without a trace. Tyler could hardly make out its route.</p>

  <p>Tyler looked towards the direction from where the white figure flew.</p>

  <p>Judging from the distance, he could tell that the white figure came from the high sky where there was only the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Did this attack come from that tower?</p>

  <p>While Tyler was lost in his thoughts, David, who was under his control, continued to stand motionless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took advantage of this opportunity to keep some distance away from David. He looked at Tyler in puzzlement. He didn't imagine that there was someone hiding in the void above him. Judging from Tyler's aura, he could tell that he was an exile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not the only one to be puzzled. Everyone from the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race stared at Tyler with a strange expression.</p>

  <p>It was an established rule that the exiles would not participate in the battles between the Wild Gods. And so far, all of them peacefully followed this rule.</p>

  <p>Even the people of the Yellow Emperor race was shocked to see Tyler appear out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Up above, a bright white vortex was rolling slowly.</p>

  <p>Soon a figure floated out of the vortex. Before he could step out, an angry voice rang out. "The Yellow Emperor race has always been following the rules diligently. By hiding here, you have tarnished your race's image and put my clansman's life at stake! Tyler, I want to know how you will justify your actions!"</p>

  <p>Ramzi bellowed those words as he walked out of the vortex. His face darkened as he glared at Tyler.</p>

  <p>He had sensed there was something wrong with David, but the oldest man kept stopping him, so he didn't do anything to save Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew that the oldest man wanted to see Luo Zheng's limits, but he didn't know that Luo Zheng could hardly resist David who was controlled by Tyler.</p>

  <p>Tyler felt thoroughly embarrassed after being questioned by Ramzi.</p>

  <p>He had been very confident that he would go undetected by the Nine Li race with the help of the Truth of Void Destruction.</p>

  <p>However, someone had attacked him from the top of the Sky South Bone Tower. If he hadn't run fast, he would have been pierced through by that arrow.</p>

  <p>Although he escaped the disaster, he exposed himself completely.</p>

  <p>"I... I..." Tyler also realized that he had stepped over the line. However, his confidence came back as an idea formed in his head. With a smirk he replied, "I was just observing the fight. David is my disciple. I was concerned that something untoward might happen to him. What's wrong with that?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Tyler's explanation, Lancelot and the other elders of the Yellow Emperor race were relieved.</p>

  <p>They were not aware that David was completely under Tyler's control, like a puppet.</p>

  <p>But the Nine Li race found out his true intentions. Things were getting very intense.</p>

  <p>Tyler was left with no option but to deny it.</p>

  <p>Ramzi sneered, "Watch the fight? Really? And is this the way to watch the fight? By hiding in a void?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed his finger at the top of the sky and infused a force of soul into David's brain.</p>

  <p>David, who had been fuzzy in the brain, quickly sobered up. After he regained his strength, his body started shaking violently. He looked in surprise at Tyler. "Master? Why are you here? I feel so weird. It seemed that I was being manipulated by someone."</p>

  <p>Hearing David speak, Lancelot sighed helplessly and rubbed his forehead. Although David was extremely talented, he could be real slow in observing the situation around him.</p>

  <p>As for his master Tyler, the corners of his mouth twitched in nervousness.</p>

  <p>Ramzi said, "Tyler, what else do you have to say?"</p>

  <p>Frowning, Tyler looked at Ramzi and then at his disciple David. He cursed himself for his action.</p>

  <p>If he had known that he would be exposed, he would have never interfered in the fight.</p>

  <p>Even if they lost, at least, he would not put himself and his race in such a position.</p>

  <p>At that moment, ripples appeared in the space behind Tyler, out of which a faint voice floated out. "Tyler's actions can be justified to his impulse.</p>

  <p>Ramzi, you don't have to be too hard because of this. You want the Sky South Bone Tower, right? We can give it to you."</p>

  <p>"Give it to us? Is this a joke? We won the bet in a fair deal, so automatically the Sky South Bone Tower belongs to us. In what context do you mean that you will give it to us?" Ramzi asked coldly.</p>
