<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing the determination in Supreme Lord Leroy's eyes, Luo Zheng finally understood— this Supreme Lord was in hiding, but not because he was afraid of Yao or the Supreme Lords behind her.</p>

  <p>His Heavenly Destiny was bestowed upon him by Xun, and the only reason he resided in the depths of the earth was to wait until he could help her take revenge.</p>

  <p>"I, Supreme Lord Leroy, was born of the Demon Night race. Never have I thought of betraying my own." Supreme Lord Leroy stared at Luo Zheng as he spoke with determination. "But if anyone tries to lead my people astray, I will be the first to object!"</p>

  <p>He then tapped the bow in his hand and the three Blood-devouring Bone Arrows started trembling. After a series of trembles, they rose from the ground and flew towards Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The arrows pierced and entered his body, but they didn't seem to leave any wound.</p>

  <p>Then, Supreme Lord Leroy stepped onto the stairs as a fierce Mu Ning emanated from his body.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord had been silent for countless years, but in less than two hours since Zheng's arrival, he had undergone a fundamental change.</p>

  <p>Leroy was like an aged arrow, silent and unmoving, but this was not a sign of his loss of power. So long as there was a sliver of a chance, he would forsake his own life for his ideals.</p>

  <p>Once more, Supreme Lord Leroy appeared before the Demon Night warriors. The corners of his eyes were wrinkled and his pupils seemed to be burning. Although he appeared old, one could tell that he was handsome in his youth.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng saved you from the Prison Island," he said. "As a Supreme Lord of the Demon Night race, I am not responsible for the punishment. But now that the Queen of Punishment has led our own race down the wrong path, it's unfair. No matter what crimes you have committed in the past, from now on, I will let bygones be bygones! I forgive you all for your crimes!"</p>

  <p>The people of the Demon Night race respected orders. Even after they escaped from the Prison Island, they were still guilty since Yao had condemned them.</p>

  <p>So Leroy had to follow through with the procedure. As a Supreme Lord, he had the qualifications to pardon them.</p>

  <p>"Now that the two queens left our race in a mess, I need to put our people on the right track. Before you follow me, you should know that I cannot guarantee your safety or your survival," Supreme Lord Leroy warned them sternly.</p>

  <p>To that, Abby immediately responded, "I will die for our queen!"</p>

  <p>"I will go for our queen!" The cheers continued.</p>

  <p>"I will go!"</p>

  <p>"I will go!"</p>

  <p>"I will go!"</p>

  <p>The people on the Prison Island had suffered for a long time, only dreaming of freedom. For the chance to follow a Supreme Lord to accomplish such a goal, they wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice their lives.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Supreme Lord Leroy muttered to himself, "Our queen is our glory!</p>

  <p>Our glory is our life!" Gradually, his voice grew louder, echoing within the spacious cave.</p>

  <p>"With eternal slaughter, we will guard the borders of our race. We will be merciless in protecting the prosperity of our race…"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the Demon Night members of the Saint Spear Sect began muttering as well.</p>

  <p>This was the declaration of the Saint Spear Sect.</p>

  <p>"Our queen is our glory! Our glory is our life!" The declaration of the Saint Chain Sect began similarly. But it was followed by, "We will uphold the order of our race with just punishment…"</p>

  <p>Now that Supreme Lord Leroy had come out, they were using the name of the Queen of Killings to gather as many Demon Night members as they could.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, under Supreme Lord Leroy's lead, many people of the Demon Night race walked through the Purple Snow World, all with a powerful Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After advancing about twenty thousand miles, they followed this boundless, snowy mountain north and finally arrived right in front of a Demon Night sacred place.</p>

  <p>The entire Purple Snow World was covered in purple snow. Only the sacred place of the Demon Night race was suffused with a green glow.</p>

  <p>The purple snowflakes that drifted there would quickly melt into nothing.</p>

  <p>It was a remote supreme world with infertile land. Its strongest sacred place was only in the eighth grade— the Purple Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The warriors that Yao and Ying had recruited were all the elites, and they were basically Spirit Transformation Realm warriors and world lords. No one in the Purple Cloud Sacred Place was ever recruited. Their Saint Lord had just entered the Spirit Transformation Realm, after all.</p>

  <p>They weren't even qualified for recruitment.</p>

  <p>When winter came, beast attacks rose in the north of the Purple Snow World— Purple Cloud Sacred Place stood tall there, blocking the attacks.</p>

  <p>Every winter, warriors of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place would be fully armed, all of the enchanted barriers would be activated, and all the warriors would be on standby.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the sacred place, dozens of Demon Night warriors stood guard atop exquisite wooden buildings, spears in hands.</p>

  <p>"Look! What is that?" one of the Demon Night warriors called out as she pointed her long spear to the horizon.</p>

  <p>A large group of black dots appeared atop the snowy mountain. Because of the great distance, it was difficult to really distinguish them. The warriors assumed it was a large flock of birds.</p>

  <p>But birds that could cross the snowy mountain were also extremely powerful and fearsome beasts.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Woo...</p>

  <p>Some of the Demon Night warriors blew their horns.</p>

  <p>The trees of the sacred place began shaking as the agile sound rang through the trees. From time to time, the sound of bowstrings tightening could be heard.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From the depths of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place, a few rays of light shot over.</p>

  <p>Leading the group was a woman wearing a red battle robe, holding a long blood-red spear in her hand. She was none other than Loraine, the Saint Lord of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Jumping onto the tallest tree she could find, she gazed into the distance.</p>

  <p>Scarlet light flickered within her eyes— she was using some sort of theurgy.</p>

  <p>Something seemed to puzzle her as she looked around.</p>

  <p>"Saint Lord, are they the Bloody Corpse Eagles?" an elder below asked.</p>

  <p>The Bloody Corpse Eagle was known to be an extremely violent giant bird, and was infamous in the Purple Snow World. Often they would come and go in groups of at least a hundred to plunder the Purple Cloud Sacred Place. If there were thousands of Bloody Corpse Eagles, they would undoubtedly cause some damage.</p>

  <p>But Loraine shook her head as she looked strangely at what lay ahead.</p>

  <p>"No, no… It's a group of Demon Night members!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Hearing the Saint Lord's words, all the elders of the sacred place wore strange expressions.</p>

  <p>At such a time, it was supposed to be impossible for the Demon Night members to visit. The elders suspected that the Saint Lord was merely mistaken.</p>

  <p>But Loraine sounded firm and when she looked at the approaching group again, she could even discern their cultivation levels. "They are all strong warriors. There seems to be world lords among them!"</p>

  <p>"World lords?" The elders below could only stare, wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>There was quite a number of world lords in the universe, adding up to a few hundred thousand. But their Purple Snow World had none.</p>

  <p>A prerequisite to gaining a world lord was having a tenth-grade sacred place. If some peerless geniuses were to appear in an eighth-grade sacred place, they would be selected before coming of age and leave the sacred place.</p>

  <p>Because of this, not many people within the Purple Cloud Sacred Place had ever seen a world lord in their lives.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be more than one world lord," Loraine grew more alert and vigilant at the thought.</p>

  <p>Although they were all from the Demon Night race, who knew what kind of people they were? It was entirely possible for them to turn out to be enemies.</p>

  <p>"How many?" the elder asked again.</p>

  <p>"Eight, no, nine... Hold on!" The red light in Loraine's eyes flickered crazily as her voice grew louder, her expression growing more and more shocked. "So many world lords? I think there are even two grand world lords among them!"</p>

  <p>Beneath Loraine, the elders were left dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warriors stared blankly at the black dots in the sky that seemed to be growing larger and larger. At the rate they were going, it didn't take long before they would enter the Purple Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" asked an elder anxiously.</p>

  <p>Withdrawing her gaze, Loraine closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, the red light in them had already dissipated. Her expression seemed to calm down when she jumped down from the treetops.</p>

  <p>"What else can we do? No matter who they are, if they want to enter our Purple Cloud Sacred Place, we will welcome them respectfully!" Loraine said calmly.</p>

  <p>Faced with a team led by two grand world lords, the Purple Cloud Sacred Place had no other choice but to wait.</p>

  <p>"You're right." The elders all gathered behind Loraine and arranged themselves orderly. Regardless of which power they were from or what their goal was, the Purple Cloud Sacred Palace did not have the qualifications to join their mission. There was no need for them to be too nervous.</p>
