<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1927 Soul-sealing Needle </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black flame, flicking its way along the eight-diagram disc, had penetrated Zheng's body like small snakes. Then, the black wisps gushed out of Zheng little by little.</p>

  <p>It was known that, first and foremost, chaos turned into Dark and Light energies. Then, Dark and Light energies turned into everything.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light Fire Array was deduced by the great technique of Dark and Light energies - and it was incredibly powerful. Refining weapon with this technique could yield twice the results, with half the effort.</p>

  <p>Quite a few True Gods in the divine land exerted the great technique of Dark and Light energies by means of clockwise rotation.</p>

  <p>Life vitality was actually quite similar to chaos. If chaos was an ordinary energy, then life vitality, in fact, could be seen as secondary energy.</p>

  <p>Under the clockwise rotation, the great technique of Dark and Light energies replaced chaos with life vitality and turned life vitality into Eight Diagrams. Eight Diagrams crushed down and would ultimately destroy the heaven and earth, which was extremely overbearing.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Drew's Dark and Light Fire Array was anticlockwise.</p>

  <p>In order to refine a supreme chaotic weapon, such was one of the key factors.</p>

  <p>Under an anticlockwise turn, chaos, but not life vitality, was turned into Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>If Holy Drew refined a supreme chaotic weapon, then it was only natural that he himself would have to prepare the chaos. This time was different though, as he was refining Zheng whose cinnabar field was filled with chaos.</p>

  <p>As the Dark and Light Fire Array rotated, Zheng's inner world developed at a constant rate!</p>

  <p>To Zheng, the concept of time became extremely delicate.</p>

  <p>After sinking into a deep slumber, his body began to grow old.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm had an average lifespan of tens of thousands of years. On the other hand, warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm could actually live anywhere from hundreds of thousands of years to millions of years! Eighty thousand years wasn't too much for Zheng to handle. It wouldn't make him grow too old, nor would it cause him to enter the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>Because she had been accompanying Zheng for such a long time, Xun had also fallen into a highly focused state.</p>

  <p>A long thin needle was afloat in the depths of her soul. The needle was mysteriously patterned with an abstruse refining technique that had never been seen in the universes.</p>

  <p>Every Demon Night queen would hold a rather mysterious ceremony when she ascended the throne.</p>

  <p>This ceremony concerned top confidential information in Demon Night.</p>

  <p>None, except perhaps a few clansmen, in Demon Night knew about it.</p>

  <p>This ceremony had been inherited from ancient Demon Night. Even Xun didn't fully understand the function or the purpose of such a ceremony.</p>

  <p>Xun wasn't the only one, though. Yao and Shania were equally just as unaware.</p>

  <p>Once the Illusion Battlefield was over, this long needle within her soul began to take action. The needle had two parts: one rotated left and the other toward the right, giving off crucial information.</p>

  <p>This information suddenly began invading her thoughts, something that Xun couldn't control nor resist.</p>

  <p>At first, the information provided by the needle was incomplete. The constant drive of information had side effects and suddenly, a strong feeling of disgust came over Xun.</p>

  <p>Astonishingly, she began to dislike Zheng!</p>

  <p>Xun quickly felt confused about her feelings. How could she dislike Zheng?</p>

  <p>This instinctive disgust, this feeling of considering Zheng as a natural enemy affected her in every moment. There was no way for her to ignore it.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, she had these feelings, but on the other, Xun knew she was fascinated by Zheng. With these two conflictive feelings, Xun had grown irritated. In order to restrain her temper, she had allowed herself to fall into a deep sleep for a certain time.</p>

  <p>As the information released by the needle grew, more and more of it came to her, and it slowly became clearer, too.</p>

  <p>Over time, she no longer just had these feelings of hatred for Zheng. Oh no, even worse, she found herself hating all human beings.</p>

  <p>This needle was just like the blood exchanging in the Celestial Position that Zheng had experienced.</p>

  <p>Blood exchanging was putting critical information into blood. The holder of the golden blood would be given a certain ability or power. But this ceremony, the one held by Demon Night, was to embed specific information into one's soul.</p>

  <p>Demon Night's method was even more overbearing. This was because not only did Xun acquire a certain ability, but even more than that, her mind had changed, too.</p>

  <p>The only way she could describe it was as though she and Zheng were natural enemies, born to hate each other, like a snake and a mouse.</p>

  <p>Xun was rather impotent to resist such a heritage from her soul.</p>

  <p>And once she had noticed this, Xun had grown even more silent in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was neither willing to leave Zheng's body, nor become his natural enemy. Therefore, instead, she curled up and went to sleep. Although Xun went to sleep, she felt very worried. She had no idea how things would proceed now, with the needle's effects.</p>

  <p>Thanks to her wisdom, she had vaguely understood that the Demon Night held a different position from the human being, and the existence of this needle had explained everything else she needed to know.</p>

  <p>The planted agents in the Evolutionary Universe included not only the sorcerer race, but also the Demon Night. Maybe even the ogre race was a planted agent in the Evolutionary Universe! The Celestial Position seemed to be on guard now, though. They were inclined to isolate the Demon Night and the ogre race when they summoned Supreme Lords to resist.</p>

  <p>The needle in Xun's soul was her nightmare. She was too worried to talk with Zheng about it. There was nothing she could do but keep as much of her mind and body as possible in a deep slumber.</p>

  <p>Xun woke up when Zheng entered the door to be tempered.</p>

  <p>After she woke up, the needle rotated again. Now, the information emerging from the needle gave her a comprehensive knowledge about the history.</p>

  <p>To destroy the Evolutionary Universe, many Holy Beings created the Demon Night in secret and placed them in the universe in a very specific way. They had actually planned this nearly three billion years ago.</p>

  <p>They were discreet when they carried out this plan. Unlike the Celestial Position, who could openly obtain the inheritance through blood exchanging, Demon Night could only obtain theirs by means of the Soul-sealing Needle.</p>

  <p>Blood exchanging could only pass on critical information, and couldn't change a person's mind.</p>

  <p>In other words, Zheng could understand the hidden information in the blood once it awakened at an appropriate time. However, the blood couldn't force Zheng to do anything and all choices and decisions remained in Zheng's hands. If Zheng felt reluctant to do something, nothing would push him to do it anyway. And the same went for the other Celestial Position members.</p>

  <p>The Soul-sealing Needle could directly manipulate one.</p>

  <p>Comparatively speaking, the Soul-sealing Needle was harder to carry out and limited to a certain amount of people, unlike the method used by the Celestial Position, which could exchange the blood of plenty clansmen.</p>

  <p>Such was one of the reasons why the Demon Night had such a unique social structure.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members believed that their three queens were at the core of everything, from the civilians to the Supreme Lords. With three queens here, all the clansmen of Demon Night were completely submissive to each of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they only needed to plant a Soul-sealing Needle in their three queens' souls, by which they would eventually control the Demon Night in its entirety. These three queens were unclear about their own destinies, but they would once the Soul-sealing Needle was activated.</p>

  <p>With this kind of scheming and conspiracy, they had created an entire race in order to overturn a universe. Was killing a Holy Being really that impossible?</p>

  <p>"I... I want to root this needle out of me!"</p>

  <p>This idea of pulling this needle out of herself had been long on Xun's mind.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately though, the Soul-sealing Needle was so deep in Xun's soul that it had already merged with her as one. It now seemed impossible to pull it out. If the Soul-sealing Needle controlled Xun's thought completely, there was no way for her to resist.</p>

  <p>If she couldn't pull it out, she then had to grind and obliterate it!</p>

  <p>A resolute expression quickly appeared on her pretty face.</p>

  <p>She had plenty of time to destroy the needle, now. Eighty thousand years was sufficient to grind the Soul-sealing Needle. What she needed now was a little perseverance.</p>

  <p>There had only been a strand of Xun's soul remaining when it was broken by Yao. She was sure she could recover this time, just as she had recovered the last time, too.</p>

  <p>Her soul lurked within Zheng's sword spirit and separating the two was easy.</p>

  <p>Xun worked hard, but the difficulty of obliterating the Soul-sealing Needle was beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>The last time Xun's soul was broken, her memories were still intact.</p>

  <p>The Soul-sealing Needle deep within her connected closely with her soul.</p>

  <p>As she tried to grind and obliterate the Soul-sealing Needle, she suffered great pain and her memories slowly faded away.</p>

  <p>Her memory declined quickly and dramatically. At the end of it all, Xun couldn't even remember why she had tortured herself like this.</p>

  <p>She'd had one and only one obsession: to erase the Soul-sealing Needle from her soul.</p>

  <p>Because her soul was so damaged, Xun's statue changed and its light faded again in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>But the Demon Night didn't notice the statue's change. The race's many powerhouses were in a state of panic, because they had received a new instruction that they couldn't resist on the day when Sacred race invaded.</p>
