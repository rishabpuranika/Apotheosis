<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A drop of sweat ran down Zheng's forehead. After a long and arduous process, his consummate sword intent was almost perfect now.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be ample streams of consummate sword intent cyclones, which Luo Zheng had often seen before. This consummate sword intent had almost reached perfection, and looked like it was impossible to advance it any further.</p>

  <p>But just in a split second, Luo Zheng was shocked to discover that his consummate sword intent suddenly became extremely unstable!</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng could easily release the sword intent with just a thought, as if it only came from his arm. However, Luo Zheng now felt that it was quite hard to control� even if the faint sword intent that lingered around his long sword had gotten increasingly powerful.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the whirlwind formed by the sword intent wasn't enough anymore. It suddenly became fidgety like a snake and constantly jumped around Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>To put it simply� instead of becoming stronger, the sword intent only became worse!</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips curled down into a frown. "Why did the sword intent suddenly become like this?" he complained.</p>

  <p>While honing the sword intent with the help of the white sword shadows did greatly enhance the sword spirit, Luo Zheng now found it difficult to control the sword intent.</p>

  <p>There was a slight trace of hesitation on Zheng's face. Should he continue this?</p>

  <p>While his eyes roamed around the scattered white shadows, he felt his determination rise up again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the type of person that once he set out to do something, he would do his best. Giving up halfway simply wasn't in him. Thus, he decided to see how his sword intent would develop at this rate.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Zheng's sword intent was impossibly strong� but he managed to suppress it by force.</p>

  <p>In addition, the speed at which the white shadows were being chopped down had increased much greater as the sword intent became even sharper.</p>

  <p>It was a good progress, and it was now possible for Luo Zheng to shatter the white sword shadows in about four sword strikes instead of the usual seven.</p>

  <p>It didn't come a surprise for Luo Zheng to hit hundreds of white sword shadows with his sword when he faced a torrent of them. And true to his prediction, he had done the job in just four consecutive strikes!</p>

  <p>The grey, rocky surface of the stone seemed to mirror Zheng's mood. His feet ached slightly as he had been standing in front of it for four hours.</p>

  <p>As he tried his best to kill the white sword shadows, Yolande's voice reverberated throughout the area.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you still contemplating the words on the huge stone? The Passing the Torch is about to begin..." she said in a faint voice. Her question was met with a slight pause.</p>

  <p>"Can you wait a bit longer?" Luo Zheng finally responded.</p>

  <p>"Sure I can, but we'll have to hold the first round of the test after the Passing the Torch begins. You should come over as soon as possible..."</p>

  <p>The disciples of thirteen palaces were still required to undergo a test together. If Luo Zheng would be late for the test, he might be ranked last. In addition, the stone inscriptions of the Original Law would be distributed after the assessment. It might have an influence on Luo Zheng if he were the last person to choose a stone inscription.</p>

  <p>However, there was a slight problem. Luo Zheng had no time to attend the examination at this moment.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand danced in a progressively swift manner as the sword intent became sharper and sharper.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Alas, Luo Zheng became a little careless and the sword intent that lingered around the sword suddenly shot out. It dashed quickly like a passing comet and shattered a dozen white sword shadows. Then it entered straight inside the nearby desert, and left behind a tiny crack.</p>

  <p>Naturally, losing his sword intent meant that Luo Zheng couldn't resist the white sword shadows, and before he could condense another sword intent, those white sword shadows engulfed him once again.</p>

  <p>Bright light entered Zheng's eyelids as he blinked repeatedly. He had apparently passed out for a bit, but he stood up and fought the white shadows once again. Luo Zheng grew braver in each passing second of the fight.</p>

  <p>Two strenuous hours later, Luo Zheng only needed three sword strikes to finish each of the white sword shadows!</p>

  <p>Another two hours had passed, and Luo Zheng needed just two strikes now.</p>

  <p>In the next two hours, Luo Zheng didn't faint again. Not a single one of the endless white sword shadows had broken through his sword flowers, and he had successfully chopped all of them off.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had failed to control his sword intent this time. Although he tried his best to maneuver it on the sword blade, it shot out every nine seconds every time he condensed a new sword intent!</p>

  <p>At least now, the white shadows could no longer devour his sword intent.</p>

  <p>It would cause Luo Zheng serious injuries or even death if the shadows were still able to do that.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's failure to control his own sword intent had made him upset. He could make hundreds of sword strikes in nine seconds, but he had to quickly condense a sword intent in that time frame as well. At this rate, he would quickly run out of his body's chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>If his belly had contained life vitality, he probably would've replenished over a thousand supreme life vitality crystals. Nevertheless, he was lucky that his body had chaotic energy in it. A wisp of it would suffice for now.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Landry and Damian watched Luo Zheng practice his sword in awe.</p>

  <p>They just sat there, motionless and full of admiration for a few hours.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't understand what was happening, they felt that something was about to come...</p>

  <p>They kept their eyes firmly fixed on Luo Zheng as they didn't want to miss anything. If Luo Zheng revealed the secret of Supreme Lord Sword, then they would have a chance to take action.</p>

  <p>It had been another hour since Luo Zheng had continuously cut the white sword shadows, and then he suddenly stood still. His sword intent suddenly shot out, but there was no newly formed sword intent this time, as no sword shadows had erupted from the large swords on the huge stone...</p>

  <p>"What happened? Why there are no sword shadows?" Luo Zheng eyed the large words in curiosity and said, "Aren't there enough sword shadows? I don't know how many white sword shadows I have shattered!"</p>

  <p>He tried to trace back what happened. In the past few hours, Luo Zheng had smashed countless white sword shadows...</p>

  <p>However, what Luo Zheng didn't know was that he had cut 9, 960, 000 white sword shadows during that time.</p>

  <p>In the past, the sharp sword intent was left on the words when Supreme Lord Sword carved the words with his sword. What pierced into the warriors' hearts were these very white sword shadows!</p>

  <p>There were originally 9, 990, 000 white sword shadows in total, but there had been too many warriors in the past millions of years who had come here to comprehend the stone in this place. While they weren't as powerful as Luo Zheng who could see the white sword shadows, some of them still accidentally shattered some of the sword shadows.</p>

  <p>Thus, it had made the other white sword shadows to attack them and make them faint! However, only a few warriors had actually done that.</p>

  <p>Even those who had noticed the sword shadows only thought that they couldn't withstand the "heart-piercing" pain, and would be ridiculed by the others...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng however, was the complete opposite. He had now shattered all of the white sword shadows and his sword intent had reached its maximum peak! It was true that he couldn't control this sword intent, but it was powerfully sharp and fierce.</p>

  <p>It seemed like Supreme Lord Sword arranged this so that he could hone his sword intent. 'But why did he create such a strange sword intent?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought. At that point, Xun decided to move.</p>

  <p>Her graceful body had left Zheng's own, and she now stood by his side.</p>

  <p>After that, she scanned her own body as well.</p>

  <p>Aside from the fact that Zheng's sword intent had become so sharp and uncontrollable, the sword spirit body had also undergone a tremendous change.</p>

  <p>The sword spirit was just an illusion at the beginning. Although Xun looked exactly like an ordinary person, she actually looked a bit different from an actual human on a closer look. She was like a reflection in water while floating in the air. The strong light could even penetrate her body!</p>

  <p>However, at present, if Xun didn't tell anyone that she was a sword spirit, nobody could know the truth! She looked just like a real body.</p>

  <p>From her flowing black hair to her snow-white skin, her whole body looked so vivid and life-like. She was no different from an ordinary person, and her body looked convincingly solid.</p>

  <p>She slightly raised her wrist and lightly touched her arm. "It seems that the sword spirit body becomes real! And when I control this sword spirit body, my strength will increase by a lot as well," she said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Back when she didn't have a vessel, she had still liked to rely on Zheng's body. It could be said that she wasn't that motivated to find a body for herself.</p>

  <p>Now that this had happened, Xun thought that she had also made a good choice in life when she accompanied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng glanced at Xun. He felt his heart race at the sight of her glossy hair and fair face. However, he soon turned back his attention towards the enormous stone.</p>

  <p>It looked like there was no way to reveal the secret left behind by Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>It had taken him several hours to strengthen his sword spirit to such an extent. This was already considered a good harvest. As for figuring out the secret of Supreme Lord Sword, that was something that could just depend on one's luck. Luo Zheng would not persist.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Passing the Torch had already begun, so Luo Zheng wasted no time and flew towards one side of the huge stone.</p>

  <p>Not long after Luo Zheng left, the two Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, Landry and Damian, were still blankly focused on the huge words on the stone.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a slight rupturing sound came from one of the words, and a crack appeared!</p>
