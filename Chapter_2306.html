<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2306 The Appearances Of Holy Beings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>There were nine pagodas, all built within ten feet of each other.</p>

  <p>Complicated, mysterious patterns were carved onto them which emitted an extremely powerful Time Law.</p>

  <p>"These nine pagodas can be pieced together, it seems," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Each pagoda had its own distinct pattern that seemed to be able to connect to another pagoda. If all nine were put together, it could form the complete picture.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race currently worshipped these nine pagodas, so a solemn and peaceful environment hung over the area.</p>

  <p>"Please wait here. Be quiet," a Sun Blind member told them in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The True Gods all nodded and found a place to sit down.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey, who had been following Liusu closely, took this as an opportunity to get closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young man was looking at the pagodas when two girls suddenly appeared beside him. He was a little surprised but kept calm. "What is it?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"What did you do to my sister?" Aleyna asked in a low voice, but there was a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Liusu doesn't seem to look happy recently," Kelsey added.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but reveal a helpless smile with these two girls questioning him.</p>

  <p>He didn't think he did anything wrong. Liusu was a princess of the Han Clan while he was a desperado who had been walking in the dark.</p>

  <p>Agreeing to her proposal would only cause her more harm.</p>

  <p>"Say it!" Aleyna snapped angrily at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng figured that she wouldn't give up that easily. He shook his head helplessly and used his chaotic energy to communicate with her.</p>

  <p>"I will be leaving soon. Your sister wanted to leave with me but I refused."</p>

  <p>It might be a better choice to just tell her the truth since Aleyna might be able to change her sister's mind. It made Luo Zheng's heart ache to see such a sad expression on Liusu's face.</p>

  <p>Aleyna tilted her head in thought and glanced at her sister carefully.</p>

  <p>She then turned to Luo Zheng and raised an eyebrow. "Why did you refuse?</p>

  <p>Isn't my sister a good woman? She was even willing to elope with you!</p>

  <p>You're so heartless to refuse her like that. A man like you..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at her in a daze. He never expected Aleyna to rebuke him.</p>

  <p>Kelsey looked at them in confusion. She just knew they were talking through telepathy. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored her and chose to reply to Aleyna verbally instead. "You know my background," he said and pointed to the ground. "If I'm here, I'll be in danger all the time."</p>

  <p>If his identity was ever exposed, then the Mu Clan would kill him with no hesitations.</p>

  <p>"My sister isn't afraid of death," Aleyna replied, chin high.</p>

  <p>"What? How can you treat your sister like that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His question made Aleyna think, and she quickly realized that she might have been overreacting. Even though she was a proving godly warrior, she was still only a teenager, and if she thought about it more rationally, she understood that Liusu wouldn't really be able to leave with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Even if you did the right thing, you shouldn't have refused her," she still insisted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew there was no use arguing with this girl, so he chose to stay silent.</p>

  <p>At this time, a group of Sun Blind members appeared at the other end of the flat square.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race normally dressed in grayish-brown robes, with some even half-naked.</p>

  <p>However, these warriors that approached were dressed in luxurious clothes decorated with faint, colorful lines. Time Law leaked out of the fabric which nobody knew just what kind of material it was made of.</p>

  <p>"These people... Are they the True Gods of Sun Blind race?" Luo Zheng asked, his gaze sweeping over the group.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind members Luo Zheng met were all divine citizens, but these ones all had high cultivation levels. The auras they emitted were completely different. The only similarity Luo Zheng could place was that they were also blind.</p>

  <p>These members were lined up on both sides of the square, arranged from highest to lowest of rank. The low-rank True Gods were outside while the top-rank True Gods and consummate True Gods were on the inside.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God slowly walked out from the middle. He quickly scanned the area with his life vitality and said in a polite voice, "Today is the Astronomical Transit Day of our Sun Blind race. We welcome the Holy Emperors from the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True God then put his hands on his chest which was indicative of the Sun Blind race's highest etiquette.</p>

  <p>His voice also faded as he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Emperors are also joining the celebration?" Luo Zheng asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race might hold a special position, but he didn't think it would be possible for them to invite the Holy Emperors of all powerful clans on the Floating Islands. True, they were an indispensable part of the Time Sea, but at the end of the day, they were mere ferrymen.</p>

  <p>Now that they were able to invite such esteemed guests, then that meant their status was much higher than what Luo Zheng first imagined.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>There were loud, swishing noises as the island began to surge.</p>

  <p>Endless, auspicious clouds bloomed one after another, as if a rare treasure had just arrived into the world. In the blink of an eye, a man in a yellow robe suddenly appeared over the island.</p>

  <p>Flying and space travelling were prohibited over the Time Sea, so even top-rank True Gods and consummate True Gods were restricted in their movements. The rules, however, didn't seem to apply to this yellow-robed man.</p>

  <p>"He is a Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked to himself after feeling an extraordinary aura emanate from this man.</p>

  <p>It wasn't his first time seeing a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>He had already met Holy Bromley when he accepted him as his personal disciple in the library of the Immortal Mansion. Later on, he met two more Holy Beings in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land: Holy Jay and Holy Drew. He also met Holy Murphy and Holy Mike.</p>

  <p>However, he did not meet them physically. The Holy Beings Luo Zheng interacted with were all soul marks or projections in their inner world.</p>

  <p>Murphy and Mike were only two energy souls when he met them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the yellow-robed man appeared, the consummate True God of the Sun Blind race immediately bowed in respect. "Greetings, Holy Hamlin!"</p>

  <p>"Holy Hamlin? Which clan is he from?" Luo Zheng asked Aleyna quietly.</p>

  <p>However, she still seemed to be unsatisfied with him and thus ignored his question.</p>

  <p>Kelsey was more helpful. "He's the Holy Emperor of the Zhao Clan, Hamlin Zhao. Outsiders call him Holy Hamlin."</p>

  <p>Hamlin Zhao nodded in acknowledgment of the consummate True God's greeting before suddenly disappearing. The next moment, he suddenly appeared above the square.</p>

  <p>As he appeared above the square, another ball of red light rolled over from the horizon and a burly man appeared out of thin air.</p>

  <p>The consummate True God politely bowed at the newcomer. "Greetings, Holy Clark!"</p>

  <p>Holy Clark's face was flushed red and he let out a loud laugh. "You're too polite!" he said, descending from the sky. He raised his fingers and gently rubbed them together. Wisps of flame appeared, weaving together and forming a huge flame throne for him to sit in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard Holy Clark's voice before. Back in the Arena of Legends, Harold announced that he forbade the Tang Clan from entering the Everest Spirit Mountain and got into a fierce argument with Clark as a result.</p>

  <p>The flame throne summoned by Holy Clark was peculiar, and Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat when he took a closer look.</p>

  <p>The flame was condensed from the Elementary Fire Divine Dao and its internal momentum was astonishing. There was no doubt that the Holy Being had mastered the Divine Dao with ease since no heat emanated from the throne despite it burning so brightly.</p>

  <p>Judging from his behavior, Holy Clark most likely became a Holy Being through his reliance on the Elementary Fire Divine Dao. Luo Zheng wasn't sure what stage it was in, but if he used the Infinity Ruler to get its internal momentum, then it would benefit him greatly.</p>

  <p>He thought about it, but did not dare act rashly.</p>
