<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3099 The Sharp-winged Sun Crows </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Tens of millions of swords rained down on the Sun Crows, killing most of them.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Sun Crows had quickly dispersed to avoid the shower of swords. They screamed in anguish at their fallen kin, and dove towards the Blue Cloud City walls, claws poised to attack.</p>

  <p>"Here they come!" Rupert's eyes sparkled and a hint of a smile played on his lips. He couldn't conceal his excitement. Turning to Zheng and Gant, he instructed, "Guys, be careful!</p>

  <p>If you can't resist them, hide under the city wall!"</p>

  <p>With a long sword in his hand, Zheng quietly inspected the invaders.</p>

  <p>Gant, on the other hand, shuffled from one foot to the other nervously. He was keenly aware that he wasn't strong enough to fight such a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>"Ca-Caw!"</p>

  <p>The piercing screams of the Sun Crows filled the air. While most of the flock flew directly into the Blue Cloud City, a fraction of them circled over the people defending the city wall.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Rupert pulled out a long sword with two blades. The blades glistened under the sun, reflecting the black of the Sun Crows that flew above.</p>

  <p>"What a good sword! This is an intermediate Profound Blood Treasure, right?" Alfie asked, unable to conceal his envy.</p>

  <p>Rupert nodded with a complacent expression.</p>

  <p>Actually, he had paid a grand price to get this sword, but he wasn't going to tell Alfie that.</p>

  <p>"Maple leaves!"</p>

  <p>Rupert's eyes flashed as he held his long sword up in front of him with both hands. Suddenly, dots of red light materialized around him, forming the shape of a maple leaf.</p>

  <p>As he swung his sword, bright red maple leaves arced in the air, slicing the Sun Crows cleanly.</p>

  <p>"Impressive!"</p>

  <p>Alfie raised an eyebrow, obviously impressed. Not wanting to be outdone, he wielded his sword.</p>

  <p>"Coiled Snake Strike!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke those words, a ray of snake-shaped radiance burst forth from his sword. The snake flew into the sky, piercing through multitudes of Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>"Wow, it seems you've mastered the Coiled Snake Swordsmanship! I'm really impressed!" Rupert praised with a look of surprise on his face.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to look weak, the others displayed their strength through their own sword skills. After all, they had dared to come to the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Gant, however, rolled his eyes at them praising each other nonstop.</p>

  <p>While his cultivation level was lower than that of the others, he knew he was their equal in terms of strength. 'I wonder if they could defend themselves against even one move from Zheng, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Zheng calmly kept to himself.</p>

  <p>He stood atop the city wall, poised with an ordinary long sword.</p>

  <p>Every time a Sun Crow got near him, with a light flick of his wrist, a white light would flash and swallow the crow.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't look particularly powerful, nor did he kill hundreds of Sun Crows in one blow, as the others did. However, upon Gant's close observation, he realized Zheng's strategy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's goal was to kill only the Sun Crows that got close to the city wall.</p>

  <p>That way, he didn't need to exert so much energy.</p>

  <p>'Zheng truly is a capable Flag Master. He doesn't show off, unlike the others.</p>

  <p>He kills the Sun Crows that actually pose a threat to the city!' Gant gave a nod of wonder and satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Wow, that guy is really weak. He's only killing one or two crows at a time," the others muttered amongst themselves whenever they'd glanced at Zheng's progress.</p>

  <p>While they didn't know what sword skill Zheng was using, they noticed he wielded his sword in a peculiar manner. He might be able to move faster, but the power in his strike was terribly weak.</p>

  <p>After a while, the excitement died down.</p>

  <p>These Sun Crows were the most common and weakest species in their race.</p>

  <p>As opposed to the Self-exploding Sun Crow and the Soul-depriving Sun Crow, these crows did not have their own innate abilities, other than sharp claws.</p>

  <p>A few minutes passed. By now, fewer and fewer Sun Crows swooped down to attack, leaving the group with a sense of relief.</p>

  <p>"With the help of the four arrays, it is a simple task to protect the Blue Cloud City," Alfie said with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>Before the attack, he had been very anxious, but now he seemed completely relaxed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that it's not that simple," Rupert said ominously, his eyes staring at something in the distance.</p>

  <p>A new flock of Sun Crows were approaching steadily. The warriors gripped their swords, poised to strike. However, once the crows were but a few thousand feet away from the city wall, rays of golden light suddenly flashed.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The black Sun Crows emitted golden lights.</p>

  <p>And their speed increased a hundredfold.</p>

  <p>Before they had a chance to react, the rays of golden light shot towards them at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!</p>

  <p>Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Rupert managed to shout as he tried to shake off his shock.</p>

  <p>One of the men on the city wall tried to sidestep to avoid a shot of golden light, but he was a split second too late. As he stumbled backwards, he clutched his chest, only to find it was slashed open and bleeding profusely.</p>

  <p>While the blow missed his vital organs, he lost his balance and stumbled over the end of the city wall.</p>

  <p>The others witnessed this in shock, and hastily made their way down the city wall. All their confidence was lost as they warily watched the sky, looking out for rays of golden light.</p>

  <p>"These are the Sharp-winged Sun Crows!" someone cried.</p>

  <p>"Their wings are as sharp as a blade, and they fly incredibly fast. They are intelligent and cunning. They can easily cut open our bellies if we are not careful enough!"</p>

  <p>"Lean against the wall! Don't reveal your weakness!"</p>

  <p>The shots of golden light dashed so quickly that it was hard to swing their swords or cast their arrays at the crows.</p>

  <p>Quickly losing hope, the people trembled with fear. Faced with formidable enemies, Gant knew what to do: stay close to Zheng. 'If Zheng can't kill these Sharp-Winged Sun Crows, no one can, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Sun Crows lived up to their reputation as intelligent creatures. They were keenly aware that if the people remained vigilant, they wouldn't have the opportunity to attack. Therefore, in the meantime, they decided to circle above the people, patiently awaiting a chance to strike.</p>

  <p>A silence fell over the city wall as the two sides regarded each other quietly, each one waiting for the other to make a move. Suddenly, the sound of a large crack pierced the atmosphere. Zheng abruptly turned around to see where the noise came from.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!"</p>

  <p>Zheng cried in horror at the scene that greeted him. The man behind him had a gaping hole where his stomach should have been, blood and guts spilling everywhere.</p>

  <p>Apparently, a cunning Sun Crow had managed to pierce through the city wall and right through the belly of this unfortunate man.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Grabbing that man's arm, Rupert rushed forward. "Don't lean on the wall!"</p>

  <p>Everyone started screaming as they scrambled to find a safe spot.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Sun Crows recognized this as their chance, and shot down in golden streaks of light.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Panic filled the air as one after another person was shot in the stomach with a ray of golden light. How could they fight back?</p>

  <p>Gritting their teeth, Alfie, Rupert and the others determinedly pointed their swords towards the sky. However, no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't seem to stop or even weaken their opponents. The speedy Sharp-winged Sun Crows easily dodged all of their attacks.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was losing hope, a white ray of sword radiance shot out into the sky.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance accurately hit a ray of golden light, completely swallowing it. When the radiance faded, the Sun Crow was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>Before Rupert and the others even had the time to react, a second white ray of sword radiance was shot out.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Another golden light was engulfed by the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Dazed and confused, the people looked around to see what was causing this white sword radiance, all except Gant. Gant smiled at the wielder of the long sword. Zheng stood calmly behind the group, holding up his sword.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Sun Crows let out piercing screams. Just then, another shot towards him at incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't even wince; he calmly flicked his wrist, summoning another white ray of sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Once again, the golden light was extinguished within the white ray.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Sharp-winged Sun Crows lined up to hit Zheng's sword radiance as if they were bewitched.</p>

  <p>"How can this be?" Rupert's mouth fell open in shock.</p>

  <p>Only Gant knew what was going on.</p>
