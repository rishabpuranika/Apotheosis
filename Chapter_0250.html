  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <p>With the demonic life energy flowing through his body, Zheng stretched his hand and forced some demonic life energy out of his body.</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy had changed indeed. Although it was still dark purple, it looked like thick dark purple fog.</p>

  <p>"I have made a breakthrough!"</p>

  <p>After being at a half-step into the nature level for a long time, Zheng had finally entered the nature level!</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy that was flowing in Zheng's body was changing into life vitality. The thick dark fog in his hand was demonic life vitality!</p>

  <p>After Zheng entered the nature level, his strength was promoted to a higher degree.</p>

  <p>It was more important that he had broken the barrier to the nature level, as in the future, Zheng would enhance speed for cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. You are now a nature creature," Saul smiled faintly and praised Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, with Saul's vision, let alone a nature creature, even a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm was insignificant.</p>

  <p>But Saul was only a servant at the fairy palace, and now, Zheng was the temporary host. As long as Zheng continued to perform well, he was destined to become the real host of the palace. Saul naturally had to respect him.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and smiled at Saul. After becoming a nature creature, Zheng was one level closer to his goal.</p>

  <p>Then he closed his eyes and started to consolidate his realm.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Zheng opened his eyes. As a nature creature, Zheng felt that his body had changed.</p>

  <p>His breath was longer and more forceful. It would take thirty minutes to take a breath.</p>

  <p>After Zheng solidified his realm, he jumped up and threw a punch in the air. This was the first move of the Heavenly Ogre Fist called Ogres Shaking the World.</p>

  <p>When he threw the punch, a black fist shadow emerged rapidly. It was more solid and faster. Since Zheng had absorbed power from the Sun Moon Stars Picture, the shadow glittered with the power of the stars.</p>

  <p>Looking at the fist shadow, Zheng curled his lips. Unfortunately, he had no opponent on whom to test the power of the Heavenly Ogre Fist. Zheng considered Saul for a while. Although Saul remained expressionless, Zheng shook his head and dismissed the idea. He knew that Saul's strength was endless. If he decided to test his new powers on Saul, there might not be a reaction.</p>

  <p>There was much for Zheng to celebrate. After all, he had become the temporary host of the fairy palace and had received the best Contemplation Picture. However, Zheng was crestfallen when he learned that he couldn't use anything in the big palace.</p>

  <p>If he could enter the pill refining room and acquire an elixir, could his strength be significantly improved?</p>

  <p>The cause and effect of everything was a blessing. Since the third host of the fairy palace had made such an arrangement, it must be for a reason.</p>

  <p>Zheng wouldn't insist on it, however.</p>

  <p>Saul had informed Zheng that he couldn't enter any other place in the fairy palace except the room in which he found himself. Considering the limitations, Zheng thought it would be a waste of his time to remain in the palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng saluted Saul and said, "I have been in the fairy palace for a long time. If there is nothing else to do, I will leave."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Saul was astonished. "This fairy palace is the perfect place to cultivate, especially since the speed to congeal life vitality is several times higher than in the outer world. If you want to cultivate, the palace is the best place. Why do you want to leave?"</p>

  <p>Saul had waited so many years to welcome the new host of the fairy palace. Now that Zheng had become the temporary host, Saul hadn't thought that Zheng would leave so soon.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head, "I have many things to do outside."</p>

  <p>Saul thought for a while and then stretched his hand. A magical token appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't understand all the complex patterns on the face of the token.</p>

  <p>However, he did recognize the word, Wind, that had also been engraved on the surface.</p>

  <p>"If you want to return to the fairy palace in the future, you need to show this token at the entrance," Saul told him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng lifted the token, it felt heavy. It was not made of gold or iron.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Zheng studied the token. He was unsure of what metal had been used to make the token.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng left, a lonely expression filled Saul's eyes. Although Saul had the body of a puppet, he had a living soul. After waiting for so many years, his soul had suffered tremendously.</p>

  <p>Zheng was touched when he saw Saul's expression. Saul had helped him many times during the tests, and so he said to Saul, "Don't worry. You have waited thousands of years. Believe me. I will return soon. Although I am only the temporary host now, I will surely become the real host of the fairy palace!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile crept on Saul's face. He said, "Come on. Maybe you can revitalize this fairy palace!"</p>

  <p>What Saul didn't tell Zheng was that after the third host of the fairy palace died, seven or eight temporary hosts had come to the palace one after another in the past. However, none could inherit the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Saul walked with Zheng until they reached the gate of the fairy palace. As Zheng took another step forward, Saul whispered to himself, "However...</p>

  <p>Ever since the first host, only this youth was able to get the Sun Moon Stars Picture. Even the second and third hosts of the fairy palace didn't qualify for it. Maybe he can complete the host's last wish."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>After leaving the fairy palace, Zheng walked inside the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>To protect himself, Zheng wore the mask again. When he returned to the Dragon Valley, he found the group of nature creatures from the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>That group of nature creatures had been waiting beside the pond because they couldn't pass the jade path.</p>

  <p>Owing to the enchantment's isolation, they couldn't see what happened in the pavilion in the middle of the pond.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a long time, they had to leave the fairy palace. After all, the palace was dangerous to them.</p>

  <p>If the two giant puppets who were led to the square edge returned, probably none of them would survive.</p>

  <p>After exiting the fairy palace, they returned to Dragon Valley and waited patiently.</p>

  <p>Perhaps seven or eight days had passed as they waited.</p>

  <p>There was no news from the fairy palace, and they didn't see anyone leave.</p>

  <p>The nature creatures felt restless. It was possible that the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm from their clans had died.</p>

  <p>Anything was possible in the dangerous fairy palace!</p>

  <p>Just at the moment, a light flashed between the two bamboos, and Zheng appeared.</p>

  <p>"It's him! It's the bloke in the mask!"</p>

  <p>"He is alive. No way!"</p>

  <p>"Where is my uncle? How is he?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the masked boy, the nature creatures were astonished. Without hesitating, they began inquiring after their clan members.</p>

  <p>Zheng crossed the jade path and entered the pavilion safely. The nature creatures were clear about the strength difference between Zheng and the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Since the pavilion was dangerous for the higher level people, they assumed that the bloke in the mask would be the first to die.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the weakest among those who entered the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had killed two nature creatures with some tricky tactics before, the nature creatures didn't think highly of him.</p>

  <p>There was a natural chasm between nature creatures and the people at the Illuminating Soul Realm, which was impossible to cross.</p>

  <p>Since only the bloke in the mask had returned, the people waiting outside couldn't accept that.</p>

  <p>Some nature creatures asked Zheng about the elders of their clans.</p>

  <p>Zheng sneered and lowered his head. He didn't intend on answering their questions.</p>

  <p>He was not in the same boat as these people and didn't feel as though he owed them an explanation. At the same time, Zheng didn't want to make trouble. As long as these nature creatures didn't get aggressive, he would let them go.</p>

  <p>While Zheng wanted to leave, the other people didn't allow him to.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Do you want to leave?" Several nature creatures blocked Zheng's path.</p>

  <p>"I don't know you. If I stay as you have requested, will you treat me to tea?" Zheng smiled faintly and mocked them.</p>

  <p>The nature creature in the front replied coldly, "We can have tea. My clan has the best Heavenly Spirit Tea in the Eastern Region. If you can explain what happened inside, I will treat you to tea every day!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head, "I am not interested. Goodbye!"</p>

  <p>"What happened to the elders from my family? Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>The man was unwilling to step aside and questioned Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression soured. "I will repeat what I said earlier. I don't know you. I am not in the mood to answer your questions. Get out of the way if you don't want to die!"</p>

  <p>The strength Zheng showed before had already left these people puzzled.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng could kill Yves and had taken Leon's life.</p>

  <p>Although some of these nature creatures were more powerful than Leon, the distance between each of them and Leon wouldn't be large. Everyone was afraid of Zheng for now.</p>

  <p>The force with which Zheng had spoken was so great that the nature creatures moved one step back. One of the men shouted, "Everyone, come together. He must know what happened in the fairy palace. Don't let him go!"</p>

  <p>It was said that there was strength in numbers. Perhaps this was why the other men felt encouraged to the degree that they challenged Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone had been fearful of Zheng, but they didn't believe that Zheng could defeat so many nature creatures by himself.</p>

  <p>Seeing so many nature creatures surrounding him, Zheng narrowed his eyes and emitted a strong killing intent. He didn't want to kill more people, but these people from the noble clans were so hard to deal with!</p>

  <p>"If you want to lose your life, come closer. I can fulfill your wish. All of you will die just like the people at the Illuminating Soul Realm in the palace!" Zheng summoned his dark purple demonic life vitality and prepared for battle.</p>

  <p>"What? All of them died?"</p>

  <p>"How about my uncle?"</p>

  <p>"No way! They are masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm. How can they die so easily? You are a liar!"</p>

  <p>What Zheng said revealed that all the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm were dead. Everyone heard that, but none of them could believe it.</p>

  <p>Since the fairy palace was a dangerous place, all of these clan members knew that even masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm were as powerless as insects and could die of an accident at any time.</p>

  <p>But they didn't believe it because they couldn't accept the truth.</p>
