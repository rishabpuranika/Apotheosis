  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <p>With the demonic life energy flowing through his body, Luo Luo Zheng stretched his hand and forced some demonic life energy out of his body.</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy had changed indeed. Although it was still dark purple, it looked like thick dark purple fog.</p>

  <p>"I have made a breakthrough!"</p>

  <p>After being at a half-step into the nature level for a long time, Luo Luo Zheng had finally entered the nature level!</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy that was flowing in Luo Zheng's body was changing into life vitality. The thick dark fog in his hand was demonic life vitality!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng entered the nature level, his strength was promoted to a higher degree.</p>

  <p>It was more important that he had broken the barrier to the nature level, as in the future, Luo Luo Zheng would enhance speed for cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. You are now a nature creature," Saul smiled faintly and praised Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, with Saul's vision, let alone a nature creature, even a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm was insignificant.</p>

  <p>But Saul was only a servant at the Immortal Mansion, and now, Luo Luo Zheng was the temporary host. As long as Luo Luo Zheng continued to perform well, he was destined to become the real host of the palace. Saul naturally had to respect him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and smiled at Saul. After becoming a nature creature, Luo Luo Zheng was one level closer to his goal.</p>

  <p>Then he closed his eyes and started to consolidate his realm.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes. As a nature creature, Luo Luo Zheng felt that his body had changed.</p>

  <p>His breath was longer and more forceful. It would take thirty minutes to take a breath.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng solidified his realm, he jumped up and threw a punch in the air. This was the first move of the Heavenly Ogre Fist called Ogres Shaking the World.</p>

  <p>When he threw the punch, a black fist shadow emerged rapidly. It was more solid and faster. Since Luo Luo Zheng had absorbed power from the Sun Moon Stars Picture, the shadow glittered with the power of the stars.</p>

  <p>Looking at the fist shadow, Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips. Unfortunately, he had no opponent on whom to test the power of the Heavenly Ogre Fist. Luo Luo Zheng considered Saul for a while. Although Saul remained expressionless, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and dismissed the idea. He knew that Saul's strength was endless. If he decided to test his new powers on Saul, there might not be a reaction.</p>

  <p>There was much for Luo Luo Zheng to celebrate. After all, he had become the temporary host of the Immortal Mansion and had received the best Contemplation Picture. However, Luo Luo Zheng was crestfallen when he learned that he couldn't use anything in the big palace.</p>

  <p>If he could enter the pill refining room and acquire an elixir, could his strength be significantly improved?</p>

  <p>The cause and effect of everything was a blessing. Since the third host of the Immortal Mansion had made such an arrangement, it must be for a reason.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't insist on it, however.</p>

  <p>Saul had informed Luo Luo Zheng that he couldn't enter any other place in the Immortal Mansion except the room in which he found himself. Considering the limitations, Luo Luo Zheng thought it would be a waste of his time to remain in the palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng saluted Saul and said, "I have been in the Immortal Mansion for a long time. If there is nothing else to do, I will leave."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Saul was astonished. "This Immortal Mansion is the perfect place to cultivate, especially since the speed to congeal life vitality is several times higher than in the outer world. If you want to cultivate, the palace is the best place. Why do you want to leave?"</p>

  <p>Saul had waited so many years to welcome the new host of the Immortal Mansion. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had become the temporary host, Saul hadn't thought that Luo Luo Zheng would leave so soon.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head, "I have many things to do outside."</p>

  <p>Saul thought for a while and then stretched his hand. A magical token appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't understand all the complex patterns on the face of the token.</p>

  <p>However, he did recognize the word, Wind, that had also been engraved on the surface.</p>

  <p>"If you want to return to the Immortal Mansion in the future, you need to show this token at the entrance," Saul told him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng lifted the token, it felt heavy. It was not made of gold or iron.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Luo Luo Zheng studied the token. He was unsure of what metal had been used to make the token.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng left, a lonely expression filled Saul's eyes. Although Saul had the body of a puppet, he had a living soul. After waiting for so many years, his soul had suffered tremendously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was touched when he saw Saul's expression. Saul had helped him many times during the tests, and so he said to Saul, "Don't worry. You have waited thousands of years. Believe me. I will return soon. Although I am only the temporary host now, I will surely become the real host of the Immortal Mansion!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile crept on Saul's face. He said, "Come on. Maybe you can revitalize this Immortal Mansion!"</p>

  <p>What Saul didn't tell Luo Luo Zheng was that after the third host of the Immortal Mansion died, seven or eight temporary hosts had come to the palace one after another in the past. However, none could inherit the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Saul walked with Luo Luo Zheng until they reached the gate of the Immortal Mansion. As Luo Luo Zheng took another step forward, Saul whispered to himself, "However...</p>

  <p>Ever since the first host, only this youth was able to get the Sun Moon Stars Picture. Even the second and third hosts of the Immortal Mansion didn't qualify for it. Maybe he can complete the host's last wish."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>After leaving the Immortal Mansion, Luo Luo Zheng walked inside the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>To protect himself, Luo Luo Zheng wore the mask again. When he returned to the Dragon Valley, he found the group of nature creatures from the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>That group of nature creatures had been waiting beside the pond because they couldn't pass the jade path.</p>

  <p>Owing to the enchantment's isolation, they couldn't see what happened in the pavilion in the middle of the pond.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a long time, they had to leave the Immortal Mansion. After all, the palace was dangerous to them.</p>

  <p>If the two giant puppets who were led to the square edge returned, probably none of them would survive.</p>

  <p>After exiting the Immortal Mansion, they returned to Dragon Valley and waited patiently.</p>

  <p>Perhaps seven or eight days had passed as they waited.</p>

  <p>There was no news from the Immortal Mansion, and they didn't see anyone leave.</p>

  <p>The nature creatures felt restless. It was possible that the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm from their clans had died.</p>

  <p>Anything was possible in the dangerous Immortal Mansion!</p>

  <p>Just at the moment, a light flashed between the two bamboos, and Luo Luo Zheng appeared.</p>

  <p>"It's him! It's the bloke in the mask!"</p>

  <p>"He is alive. No way!"</p>

  <p>"Where is my uncle? How is he?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the masked boy, the nature creatures were astonished. Without hesitating, they began inquiring after their clan members.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng crossed the jade path and entered the pavilion safely. The nature creatures were clear about the strength difference between Luo Luo Zheng and the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Since the pavilion was dangerous for the higher level people, they assumed that the bloke in the mask would be the first to die.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the weakest among those who entered the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had killed two nature creatures with some tricky tactics before, the nature creatures didn't think highly of him.</p>

  <p>There was a natural chasm between nature creatures and the people at the Illuminating Soul Realm, which was impossible to cross.</p>

  <p>Since only the bloke in the mask had returned, the people waiting outside couldn't accept that.</p>

  <p>Some nature creatures asked Luo Luo Zheng about the elders of their clans.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sneered and lowered his head. He didn't intend on answering their questions.</p>

  <p>He was not in the same boat as these people and didn't feel as though he owed them an explanation. At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to make trouble. As long as these nature creatures didn't get aggressive, he would let them go.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng wanted to leave, the other people didn't allow him to.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Do you want to leave?" Several nature creatures blocked Luo Zheng's path.</p>

  <p>"I don't know you. If I stay as you have requested, will you treat me to tea?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and mocked them.</p>

  <p>The nature creature in the front replied coldly, "We can have tea. My clan has the best Heavenly Spirit Tea in the Eastern Region. If you can explain what happened inside, I will treat you to tea every day!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head, "I am not interested. Goodbye!"</p>

  <p>"What happened to the elders from my family? Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>The man was unwilling to step aside and questioned Luo Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression soured. "I will repeat what I said earlier. I don't know you. I am not in the mood to answer your questions. Get out of the way if you don't want to die!"</p>

  <p>The strength Luo Luo Zheng showed before had already left these people puzzled.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng could kill Yves and had taken Leon's life.</p>

  <p>Although some of these nature creatures were more powerful than Leon, the distance between each of them and Leon wouldn't be large. Everyone was afraid of Luo Luo Zheng for now.</p>

  <p>The force with which Luo Luo Zheng had spoken was so great that the nature creatures moved one step back. One of the men shouted, "Everyone, come together. He must know what happened in the Immortal Mansion. Don't let him go!"</p>

  <p>It was said that there was strength in numbers. Perhaps this was why the other men felt encouraged to the degree that they challenged Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone had been fearful of Luo Luo Zheng, but they didn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng could defeat so many nature creatures by himself.</p>

  <p>Seeing so many nature creatures surrounding him, Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and emitted a strong killing intent. He didn't want to kill more people, but these people from the noble clans were so hard to deal with!</p>

  <p>"If you want to lose your life, come closer. I can fulfill your wish. All of you will die just like the people at the Illuminating Soul Realm in the palace!" Luo Luo Zheng summoned his dark purple demonic life vitality and prepared for battle.</p>

  <p>"What? All of them died?"</p>

  <p>"How about my uncle?"</p>

  <p>"No way! They are masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm. How can they die so easily? You are a liar!"</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng said revealed that all the masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm were dead. Everyone heard that, but none of them could believe it.</p>

  <p>Since the Immortal Mansion was a dangerous place, all of these clan members knew that even masters at the Illuminating Soul Realm were as powerless as insects and could die of an accident at any time.</p>

  <p>But they didn't believe it because they couldn't accept the truth.</p>
