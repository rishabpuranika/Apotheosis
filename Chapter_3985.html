  <p>
</p>

  <p>After some of Pearson's threads were corroded, he grew a little weak.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Stone Spirits with a pale face, he shook his head. "I've tried my best, but I can't stop them."</p>

  <p>He wanted to take Sawyer and Thurston away but the two brothers' serious demeanor made him hesitate.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>While the Stone Spirits seemed to be slow in movement, they were actually quickly rushing forward, making the ground tremble.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the creatures held their breaths. They were looking for an opportunity to make their move, but first, they had to carefully observe the humans' skills.</p>

  <p>Fuxi narrowed his eyes at the sight of the Stone Spirits growing closer and closer. Finally, he couldn't restrain himself any longer and stretched out his hand to make a smack.</p>

  <p>The palm condensed by the Solid Lightning Powder appeared among the Stone Spirits and collided with the Eight Diagrams mark, now emitting a snow-white light.</p>

  <p>Almost all the creatures were enveloped by the light? they had to shield their eyes with their hands.</p>

  <p>Following the flash of light, there was a dense and indistinct sound of thunder, like the piercing pitch of a sharp object tearing at a surface. The power that surged had all the mist creatures and Terror Mice quickly retreat.</p>

  <p>Some of them even jumped from the seventh stair to the sixth.</p>

  <p>After a while, the lightning finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>Once everyone recovered their sight, they saw the Stone Spirits in the center of the open space lying on the ground. Most of their bodies were completely charred, their hands and feet were chopped to pieces, and some figures were even smashed into powder.</p>

  <p>"How horrible?" a Terror Mouse remarked while climbing up from the sixth stair, getting a peek at the scene.</p>

  <p>"It was the Heavenly Thunder Plain's lightning. How did he make it?" The mist creatures exchanged glances, confused.</p>

  <p>"It has something to do with the powder," shouted a giant.</p>

  <p>Then, the others began yelling as well, making the other creatures cast a cold glance at them.</p>

  <p>Anyone with a discerning eye could easily see that it had something to do with the powder in Fuxi's hand? they wondered if he still had any with him.</p>

  <p>On the ground lay the Stone Spirits that could no longer get up. They gathered so densely that all of them were enveloped by the lightning. None of them managed to escape.</p>

  <p>Silence filled the seventh stair.</p>

  <p>All the creatures' eyes were on Fuxi.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the lightning was the humans' best trump card.</p>

  <p>The powder was supposedly highly rare, so it was likely to be limited.</p>

  <p>If Fuxi didn't have any left, the situation would be simple.</p>

  <p>Noticing all the creatures staring at him, Fuxi couldn't help but feel a tad bit embarrassed.</p>

  <p>He undoubtedly knew what they were thinking.</p>

  <p>But now, he had used up all the Solid Lightning Powder. He couldn't use it again.</p>

  <p>While Fuxi stood stiff, the Snake Goddess suddenly turned to Pearson.</p>

  <p>"Eternal Realm Hunter, you still have some brown divine thunder powder.</p>

  <p>Please bring it out."</p>

  <p>What was that divine thunder powder?</p>

  <p>Before Thurston and Sawyer could even comprehend what she said, Pearson knew exactly what the Snake Goddess was referring to. With a flip of his hand, brown powder began pouring out.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the Solid Lightning Powder, but the Bone-coagulating Powder that had been used to destroy the Space Manipulating Spirit's Endless Corridor.</p>

  <p>The two kinds of powder looked exactly the same. Both were brown, but their auras were completely different? one contained the power of lightning, while the other contained the power of space. One's spiritual sense could pick out the difference.</p>

  <p>But as an Eternal Realm Hunter, Pearson was experienced. When he poured out the Bone-coagulating Powder, he hid its aura ingeniously.</p>

  <p>Seeing what Pearson did, the Snake Goddess seemed appreciative.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that the Eternal Realm Hunters could stay in the Three Purities Stage for such a long time. Their reactions were rather quick.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, Pearson had just obtained quite an amount of Bone-coagulating Powder? it turned into a palm as tall as ten feet and stood before Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>The sight rendered the creatures speechless.</p>

  <p>Previously, the brown palm wasn't as large as the current one, but it had still managed to annihilate all the Stone Spirits with its immense power. Just how terrifying would this brown palm be?</p>

  <p>Just like what happened the last time, no one dared to make a move.</p>

  <p>But while Pearson and Fuxi's cooperation was flawless, there were still some doubts.</p>

  <p>The golden-horned bull-headed man knew that Thurston, Pearson, and Sawyer were the Eternal Realm Hunters from the very beginning. Although they weren't humans, when the Snake Goddess asked Pearson for the powder, Thurston and Sawyer looked completely stunned and unaware of the powder? it was all too strange.</p>

  <p>Even stranger was the fact that Pearson had deliberately hidden the brown powder's aura.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed man quietly sent his analysis to the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. The latter agreed, but she sneered as she asked, "Will you dare to launch an attack? If you want, I'll send you there."</p>

  <p>The bull-headed man merely glared at her and said nothing.</p>

  <p>While he was indeed suspicious, he didn't have to risk his life over it.</p>

  <p>But the situation couldn't go on as such.</p>

  <p>Soon, some of the creatures came up with an idea? they asked each of the races to gather some creatures and set up an attack together.</p>

  <p>The plan was acceptable enough for all the races to agree.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the creatures prepared for a new attack, Fuxi and the rest pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>They were still facing an impasse, after all. No one was attacking them yet, but who could tell when they would need their defenses up before the wind in the Purple Wind Gorge came to a halt?</p>

  <p>As quickly as possible, the creatures selected a number of daredevils.</p>

  <p>These daredevils were to test the powder in Fuxi's hands? if it was truly the Solid Lightning Powder, they would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>But the leaders' orders were to be strictly followed without complaints.</p>

  <p>After forming a new team, they were ready to make a move.</p>

  <p>Fuxi frowned. The Eight Diagrams mark was now floating before him as the great palm was ready to slap at any time.</p>

  <p>The selected daredevils' bodies trembled violently. If the palm exploded, they would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>"Are you courting death?"</p>

  <p>When Fuxi roared, the mark of the Eight Diagrams began rotating.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was actually going to slap the palm, the daredevils who were determined to sacrifice themselves stopped simultaneously, some of them even stepping back.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi didn't dare to use the palm.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the creatures would find out it wasn't the Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's calm expression shifted, a trace of anxiety filling his eyes. While he had hidden it well, the Snake Goddess had sensed it.</p>

  <p>What he was waiting for hadn't arrived.</p>

  <p>But a great battle could spark at any moment.</p>

  <p>"It's fake!"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't dare to use the powder. This is their last life-saving straw.</p>

  <p>Attack them!"</p>

  <p>"We aren't cowards!"</p>

  <p>At this point, the leaders began encouraging the daredevils.</p>

  <p>While the daredevils were unwilling, they continued to grit their teeth and rush forward.</p>

  <p>Regardless of what means Fuxi used, he couldn't scare the daredevils away.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng sensed something.</p>

  <p>At the far end of the Purple Wind Gorge, a purple wind mixed with a green wind, the latter rolling and dancing, approaching rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Master Fuxi, use the palm!" Luo Zheng suddenly called out.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Fuxi asked in return, stunned.</p>

  <p>"Do as I say!" Luo Zheng firmly ordered.</p>

  <p>While Fuxi didn't appreciate Luo Zheng's tone, he didn't dare to ignore his command at the critical moment of life and death. And so he struck the giant palm made from the Bone-coagulating Powder.</p>
