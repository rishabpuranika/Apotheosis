  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lawler, Duran, the other Bird Masters, Alphonse and the other human spirits were all raring to initiate the fight.</p>

  <p>It was, after all, better than doing nothing.</p>

  <p>They were bound to face the Treacherous Beings starting to come alive one after another anyway.</p>

  <p>But the Monkey Spirit King had the final say here.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters and the human spirits couldn't disobey his order.</p>

  <p>An hour had passed when they suddenly spotted a space fluctuation in the distance, rapidly coming nearer and nearer. Before long, it was already floating close to the altar. It was in the shape of a ball, enclosing something shining with a golden light.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes widened in sudden recognition. "This is a set of coordinates!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"The coordinates of the Snake Spirit King?"</p>

  <p>"The two golden crosses are huge. It must be his!"</p>

  <p>The sizes and coordinates of Treacherous Beings were directly proportional to each other.</p>

  <p>This was why the coordinates of the monkey spirits, such as Manuel and Tearrag, were far smaller than that of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The coordinates in the ball were almost the same size as the Snake Spirit King, so they were likely his.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King scoffed and strode forward. "I don't know what you're thinking, but you must have a death wish since you're showing your coordinates to us."</p>

  <p>"No, wait!" the Snake Goddess said, wanting to stop the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>But he was bull-headed and intractable.</p>

  <p>He turned a deaf ear to the warning. He launched himself into the sky and tried to grab the ball.</p>

  <p>The ball continued to float in the air undisturbed.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King caught nothing.</p>

  <p>"Hiding in space, huh?" the Monkey Spirit King sneered. One of the wolf teeth flashed and began emitting a strong power of space.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's palm began to glow with the space power, making it look like he was wearing a blue crystal glove.</p>

  <p>He leapt up and tried to grab the ball again.</p>

  <p>He still got nothing.</p>

  <p>The ball was like a pocket of air which could only be seen and couldn't be touched.</p>

  <p>In the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan was best at using the space theurgy.</p>

  <p>But even he wouldn't be able to get the ball.</p>

  <p>A huge snake head slowly emerged from the golden coordinates in the ball. It was the Snake Spirit King, laughing loudly. "You are as strong as ever, Orlando, but you still have nothing on me."</p>

  <p>Seething at Cornelius' mockery, Orlando lunged at the ball again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King kept swiping at the ball, to no avail. His fists, as big as hills and usually powerful enough to destroy the heaven and earth, proved futile now. They couldn't touch the Snake Spirit King at all.</p>

  <p>"What's that ball that contains the coordinates?"</p>

  <p>"It must be formed by some mysterious Space Law."</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Spirit King can't break it!"</p>

  <p>"Who knows what it is?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was stumped.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. "The Snake Spirit King must be confident in that ball to dare to bring the coordinates in it."</p>

  <p>"We don't know what the ball is. Does it make the Snake Spirit King invincible?" the Wing King muttered, thinking aloud.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters and the human spirits trained all their attention on the ball, trying to figure it out.</p>

  <p>There were many masters who were proficient in the space theurgy among them, but even they were puzzled.</p>

  <p>Under the violent attacks of the Monkey Spirit King, the Snake Spirit King had revived from his coordinates. He darted out while the former was off-guard, gripping him with lethal force.</p>

  <p>Orlando was taken aback by the sudden attack, but soon found his bearings. "You think you can kill me with this? How arrogant."</p>

  <p>Had Cornelius continued to just hide in the ball, Orlando wouldn't have been able to reach him. But now that he had come out, he could smash him like an egg.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's arms began to expand. With his strength, he could break Cornelius easily.</p>

  <p>But just then, silver runes appeared on Cornelius' body. His soft flesh took on a metallic sheen. In a moment, his body had hardened like steel wrapped around the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King struggled, but he failed to break free.</p>

  <p>"I'm never arrogant. That's more your style," the Snake Spirit King sneered.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Silver spikes jutted out of the Snake Spirit King's body and pierced into the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A huge Holy Stone suddenly appeared in the ball still floating above the two kings.</p>

  <p>The Holy Stone had already been activated. The Light of Annihilation enveloped the two kings.</p>

  <p>This was now a fight to the death.</p>

  <p>"I can come back to life again and again. What about you? Could you also revive?" the Snake Spirit King hissed menacingly.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't even kill me once!"</p>

  <p>As the Monkey Spirit King spat these words out, the twenty-two wolf teeth around his necklace began to flicker.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power of the wolf teeth flowed and gathered in his body.</p>

  <p>Before long, a wild aura burst out from him.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had always been domineering and overbearing.</p>

  <p>The first thirteen wolf teeth possessed blended bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, different bloodlines would be used one at a time to deal with different enemies.</p>

  <p>But when enraged, the Monkey Spirit King couldn't care less. He would just deploy all thirteen bloodlines he had mastered.</p>

  <p>The thirteen kinds of bloodlines would usually not fuse with each other.</p>

  <p>At worst, they could even clash.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King could integrate them forcibly to obtain an unexpectedly destructive power. This was how he had once been able to kill thirteen ancient monsters of a powerful race with a single punch, shocking the entire main world.</p>

  <p>The Bold Conjecture House had tried to analyze the technique and recreate this power, but failed. Elder Xue had bitterly noted then that the Monkey Spirit King had simply lucked out and discovered the extremely powerful technique by accident.</p>

  <p>If anyone else had tried to integrate the bloodlines, they would have died.</p>

  <p>Now, the Monkey Spirit King meant to use the same method for twenty-two bloodlines.</p>

  <p>The bloodlines tangled in his body. One released the smell of fire.</p>

  <p>Another revealed the power of life. Another sent a thousand bolts of lightning crackling throughout his body. Even the space around him began to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>"What power is this?" The Snake Spirit King was utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"The power to kill you," the Monkey Spirit King said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>A ball of light bloomed from his body like a rapidly growing sun. The light soon devoured him, the Snake Spirit King and everything within a few miles, including the ball which protected the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>
