<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Stirring up any trouble on the island of the Sun Blind race was not, by any means, a wise decision for anyone, including the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The head of the Sun Blind race wore a mask, hiding her expression, but her voice remained calm. "The Sun Blind race holds the Astronomical Transit Day celebration, and all the young warriors we invited are our friends. Obtaining a chance in the Time Sea Forbidden Land highly depends on one's own luck and ability! Now that the young man has obtained the jade seal, he can give it to whomever he wants to."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Nicholas chuckled and said, "That would be great. Samuel, I'm afraid you'll have to give up this time!"</p>

  <p>Samuel's face darkened at that.</p>

  <p>'Humph! If it were Alfredo who succeeded in acquiring the jade seal, Nicholas would be too shameful to say something like that, ' he cursed inwardly.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's identity was such a sensitive matter that Samuel couldn't come up with an idea for a retort.</p>

  <p>The jade seal should've belonged to the Han Clan, but Samuel could only watch helplessly as it was about to be handed to the Dongfang Clan. It was no wonder that Samuel was frustrated, in spite of him being a Holy Being— someone supposed to be always calm and composed.</p>

  <p>Still, he managed to recover in the blink of an eye. With a slight smile, he generously said, "Congratulations, Nicholas. You have extraordinary insight. You must have known from the beginning that Tianxing could obtain the jade seal. I must endure any pain and give this treasure up."</p>

  <p>With that, he shook his head— his face was full of admiration for Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The other nodded slightly, staring at him with mutual admiration. "I don't have many people I can look up to in the divine land, but you must be one of them. I believe the Han Clan will rise up the ranks in the future."</p>

  <p>Now, with Zheng's help, the Floating Island of the Han Clan had gone up a higher level.</p>

  <p>Even if the Han Clan continued climbing up, it was impossible to defeat the Dongfang Clan. But the rise of the Han Clan meant the inevitable decline of the other clans. It was rather interesting to think about what Nicholas meant by what he said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Jeremiah, the Holy Being of the Leng Clan, remained silent as a look of disdain surfaced on his expression.</p>

  <p>Below the Holy Beings stood the True Gods who had already left the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't sense the scene in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, they could clearly hear the Holy Beings' discussion.</p>

  <p>Soren, Reginald, and the other top-rank True Gods were all shocked upon hearing the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo has obtained the jade seal?"</p>

  <p>"He is indeed in the halo of light, but many consummate True Gods have entered it as well!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that guy too lucky? How could he have gotten the jade seal before so many consummate True Gods? He'll be killed if he shows up!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the True Gods, a consummate True God was simply impossible to overcome.</p>

  <p>But they didn't know that the space and time within the jade seal had blocked all of the internal momentum of the divine land. The strength of a consummate True God had been reduced to less than a percent of their peak— all they could do was fight hard with their brute strength.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brute strength was not an absolute disadvantage in the face of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, he actually made it!" Surprise was written all over Aleyna's pretty face.</p>

  <p>Even Kelsey was shocked by it. "This guy…How lucky he is!"</p>

  <p>Though she had already known of Zheng's extraordinary strength in the Heavenly Han House, she thought that he was only outstanding when compared to those grassroots. Never did she think that Zheng could really compare with the warriors from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>But this fellow had produced so many incredible miracles before her— her heart was so filled with shock that she couldn't even begin to describe Zheng's many achievements.</p>

  <p>Standing between the two girls was Liusu, gawking at the exit of the Time Sea Forbidden land. There was no trace of joy on her face.</p>

  <p>So what if Zheng obtained the jade seal?</p>

  <p>How could he fight against Nicholas, a Holy Being?</p>

  <p>It sounded like her father, Samuel, had no plan to fight Nicholas for the jade seal— he had intended to give both Zheng and the jade seal to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas was interested in Zheng before, now, he was much more interested in the jade seal. He would probably take it and kill Zheng; such a result was almost irresistible.</p>

  <p>Having thought it over, Liusu couldn't do anything but watch it happen. She was merely a True God, after all. What could she really do?</p>

  <p>But she didn't stop praying in her heart. Zheng was the son of miracle, and she was hoping he could somehow perform another miracle for her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the forbidden land, Zheng took Nelly and went back the way they came.</p>

  <p>They faced no obstructions along the way.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts should have been lured away by the True Gods who returned ahead of time.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the road to the Divine Time Temple was completely empty.</p>

  <p>In this section of the road, Zheng slowed his pace.</p>

  <p>His mind was running thoughts about various possibilities after he left the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Behind him, Nelly said nothing and quietly followed after him.</p>

  <p>Soon after they passed the Divine Time Temple, Zheng saw pieces of gold scattered on the ground. They were the pieces of gold left after the Time Ghosts cut up the Golden Beast Statue.</p>

  <p>Previously, to lure the Time Ghosts away, Zheng had no chance to take the pieces of gold back. At this moment, all he focused on was collecting all the pieces of gold until they melted into the Golden Beast Statue once again.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng had sent the Golden Beast Statue to Master Evil to serve as his body, it wasn't the right time to consider the insignificant parts.</p>

  <p>Soon after taking the statue, he walked forward until he finally encountered a group of Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>Halting in his steps, he whispered to Nelly, "We will use the old way. I'll use the statue to lead the Time Ghosts away and you must follow up."</p>

  <p>But Nelly thought nothing of them at all. "Are you nervous?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Why should I be nervous?" Zheng looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"You will face those Holy Beings soon."</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely shrugged his shoulders in response.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue turned into a golden light that shot right at the Time Ghosts. When they grew restless and started following the Golden Beast Statue, Zheng shouted coldly, "Run!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The two dashed to the exit.</p>

  <p>After the statue led the Time Ghosts away, no more obstacles stood in their way. They took the chance to quickly move forward.</p>

  <p>But much to their surprise, a large group of Time Ghosts suddenly appeared before them once again just as they had rushed out a significant distance.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Nelly asked in urgency.</p>

  <p>Not far behind Zheng, she also saw the group of Time Ghosts trying to stop them.</p>

  <p>The statue had already attracted a group of them. If the first group turned against them again, they'd be surrounded. But if they didn't lead the Time Ghosts ahead of them away, they wouldn't be able to get to the exit at all.</p>

  <p>"Charge," Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>With that, Nelly realized that he had a special ability with the help of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>She couldn't figure out how he made it. It seemed as though no matter how seriously injured he was, he could recover in an instant.</p>

  <p>But no matter what the situation was, she trusted him wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>When they approached the Time Ghosts, the large group began circling crazily like a group of headless flies before rushing towards Zheng and Nelly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land also craned their necks to catch the scene.</p>

  <p>They were also aware that the ability of the jade seal seemed to have been able to devour a period of time. But their curiosity lingered because they hadn't actually seen Zheng display such an ability in person.</p>

  <p>As the densely packed group of Time Ghosts pounced, a sudden thought flashed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>'Swallow the time of nine seconds…'</p>

  <p>The giant bugs lying on the beams of light began to wiggle, swallowing up all the nine seconds.</p>

  <p>With this thought, Zheng tore up another three pages of the book of time.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of the Holy Beings, Zheng and Nelly were already caught by the Time Ghosts. They were dragged into the time cracks and the two were cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>But after a sudden flash of their figures, they were able to pass through the crowd of Time Ghosts and swiftly move forward.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts even seemed to be in a daze. It wasn't after a moment that they got their senses back and chased after Zheng and Nelly in a frenzy.</p>
