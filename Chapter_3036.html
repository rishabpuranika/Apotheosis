  <p>
</p>

  <p>"That is... Master Goran!" exclaimed Laura in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Winchell might be a stranger to Ingram, but Goran's name had long resounded in Ingram's ears. Goran was one of the three Taiyi Governors in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and both him and Qiu Yinhe were well-known there.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had really made it!</p>

  <p>All the disciples were shocked.</p>

  <p>Elgin had given up. Luo Zheng had threatened him once and he didn't dare to say anything since then.</p>

  <p>But the moment he saw Luo Zheng's reinforcements, he realized he had made a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>Disciples like Beldene regarded Luo Zheng with reverence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's background was mysterious. The fact that he could call in such powerhouses meant that he was strong as well. But why had he joined the insignificant Sword Light Palace in the first place?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself could not answer this question. No. 9527 had asked him to join the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Winchell ignored Reynald and the members of the Black Armor race and looked down as he asked, "Who is  Luo Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood up and bowed to him. "I am," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Great! You are still alive!" Winchell laughed as he flew down. He crushed the Latent token and landed on the ground beside Luo Zheng. He stared at him as he said, "I heard from Dora that you can save my son. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can," Luo Zheng replied without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Very good! I hope you won't let me down!" Winchell said, patting Luo Zheng's shoulder in satisfaction. He liked Luo Zheng's frankness.</p>

  <p>He had gone to such lengths so fast for his son's sake and now that Luo Zheng had personally confirmed it, he felt much more relieved.</p>

  <p>Reynald's and Ibrahim's hearts sank as they watched this scene unfold.</p>

  <p>The two men who had appeared so suddenly didn't show any killing intent, but they knew from their auras that they couldn't resist them. They felt like two ants standing before elephants and that it would be meaningless to run away.</p>

  <p>'Even I can't call in such powerhouses.</p>

  <p>How did Luo Zheng, a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, do that?'</p>

  <p>Reynald thought, his blood boiling.</p>

  <p>"Tell me. Who has trapped you here? Who are you going to kill?" Winchell asked.</p>

  <p>Winchell and Goran used their sharp insight to tell what was going on with a single glance. The warriors outside the Heaven Earth Umbrella could be killed, including the man at the Other Shore Realm who stood with the people of the Black Armor race.</p>

  <p>Winchell looked fierce, but he was thinking something furiously. He wanted to tell everyone that he had made his way through so many big provinces just to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew this and smiled as he looked at Reynald.</p>

  <p>Reynald trembled as he felt Luo Zheng's gaze on him. Luo Zheng pointed at him and said,</p>

  <p>"He has to die along with the people of the foreign race."</p>

  <p>Knowing that he was about to be killed, Reynald tried to display the Grand Teleportation before Luo Zheng finished talking.</p>

  <p>Ibrahim and the other members of the Black Armor race thought the same.</p>

  <p>This might be their last chance to escape.</p>

  <p>But it was too late. Winchell had already clenched his fists and launched a few punches into the sky.</p>

  <p>Invisible fist prints twisted the space, clanging dully.</p>

  <p>The space fluctuations that Reynald and his group had condensed were shattered by the fist prints. Their bodies, cinnabar fields, and souls followed.</p>

  <p>The disciples were shocked yet again.</p>

  <p>Reynald had been the leader of the Sword Light Palace for a long time, but he wasn't strong enough to fight Winchell. In the end, he died in the same way as the people of the Black Armor race who had just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Winchell hadn't needed to bring out all his strength. He had only needed one strike to slay all his opponents.</p>

  <p>That was what a real human master was capable of.</p>

  <p>Once Winchell had killed all the enemies, Goran descended slowly as he stared at Laura. "What happened to the time-honored Sword Light Palace?</p>

  <p>Why was it destroyed so suddenly?" he asked in concern.</p>

  <p>Winchell didn't care about the Sword Light Palace. But since the Sword Light Palace was part of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Goran needed to know what had happened.</p>

  <p>"The one who Master Winchell just killed was our leader."</p>

  <p>Laura filled Goran in on what had happened in the Sword Light Palace these past few days.</p>

  <p>Goran paced, his hands behind his back as he said, "The Seven-Star Province is desolate. It was quite difficult for Qiu Yinhe to build the Sword Light Palace against so many nonhuman creatures. And I know it mustn't have been easy for you to resist for so long."</p>

  <p>"This damned place is not as valuable as he thought. The business alliances have made a fortune by virtue of the trade routes you built. I think all survivors should leave this place and be sent to the Taiyi Heaven Palace for Qiu Yinhe to deal with," said Winchell.</p>

  <p>The disciples lit up at his words.</p>

  <p>For outstanding disciples like Elgin and Beldene, the Taiyi Heaven Palace was their ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>It was just that with their talents, the Taiyi Heaven Palace wouldn't choose them. That was why Elgin was jealous of Luo Zheng. And it would be a blessing in disguise if they could really go to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Goran glanced at the disciples and then at Laura and said, "It's an option, but they have to choose for themselves."</p>

  <p>Laura and Ingram looked at each other, their eyes full of decisiveness.</p>

  <p>They yearned for the Taiyi Heaven Palace too. With Ingram's talents and temperament, he might become a Taiyi Guard if he went to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>But as key members of the Sword Light Palace, they couldn't leave when the palace was in trouble.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star City had been destroyed but there were more than a dozen other big cities in the Seven-Star Province. If they left, more than ten million divine citizens would be eventually devoured by monsters, and the Seven-Star Province would become desolated again.</p>

  <p>Laura told Goran what she was thinking.</p>

  <p>Goran didn't force her. Instead, he helped her control the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>Although the Sword Light Palace had been destroyed, it would be prosperous again under the protection of the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>Winchell and Goran stayed in the Seven-Star Province only for half a day.</p>

  <p>After that, he put Luo Zheng and over a hundred disciples in a small world. He then drove the Guiding Sword to leave alongside Winchell.</p>

  <p>In the small world, Beldene, Elgin, and the others were very excited.</p>

  <p>Faegan and Kenelm felt like they were in a dream.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace was the place where really powerful human warriors lived. It was a legendary great force. Kenelm invited Luo Zheng to look for the tomb, and accidentally involved them in the disaster of the Sword Light Palace. He was now on his way to the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He couldn't believe his good luck.</p>
