<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the World Commercial Alliance didn't underestimate Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, this magic array wasn't designed for the warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm like Luo Zheng, nor for those who already reached the peak of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>In fact, the massive magic array was particularly designed for the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm. There weren't many warriors at the peak of the Illuminating Soul Realm that were permitted to enter it. However, they were able to make it to the sixth or seventh wave of attacks before their pagodas were destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Let's see. Anyway, it's amazing that a runic expert could pass the registration examination by simply changing the color of the magnetic stone," Michael said with surprise, shaking his head. Although he admired Zheng's rune accomplishments, the magic array hadn't tested the rune level.</p>

  <p>However, it did test the strength of the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Actually, I'm also curious about how this guy passed the registration examination," said the middle-aged warrior with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cultivation was far too low to be noticeable. He was a warrior at the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm and attracted the gaze of other warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged warrior continued, "I have already sent someone to ask Xiao to bring the records of the examination today. I don't even know whether he's on his way here."</p>

  <p>While they were talking, an old man arrived. The man standing at the gate was Xiao, whom the middle-aged warrior had mentioned before. He was exactly the examiner with the moustache, who was in charge of the registration.</p>

  <p>Michael greeted Xiao with a broad smile on his face, "Hello, Xiao. You've arrived at the perfect moment, as we were just talking about you."</p>

  <p>Xiao nodded. His eyes had already shifted to the huge Picture Slab. He then asked, "What's the result of the warrior,  Luo Zheng Luo, in the magic array?"</p>

  <p>What he said confused Michael and the middle-aged warrior a lot. Michael asked, "Why do you want to know his result?"</p>

  <p>With a smile, Xiao shook his head without saying anything at all. He then narrowed his eyes on the Picture Slab, where Zheng's picture was displayed vividly, next to all of his personal information.</p>

  <p>"He is the 392nd to pass the first wave?" A look of surprise graced Xiao's face. "What a low result," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Zheng's result was beyond his expectation. He thought that Luo Zheng had the potential to do much better than that.</p>

  <p>Seeing Xiao's surprised expression, Michael and the middle-aged warrior grew even more confused. Michael said, "What's wrong? This result is quite normal. He is just a runic expert at the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm…"</p>

  <p>"A runic expert? Are you serious?" Xiao shrieked while interrupting Michael.</p>

  <p>Michael continued with a smile, "Oh, you're so forgetful. Don't you remember? I got this news from Cloudy City. A promising runic expert emerged in the Cloud Hall over there. He has performed Perfect Brushwork and has the potential to become a remarkable runic expert one day."</p>

  <p>Xiao screamed in disbelief, "Oh, good lord!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Michael asked impatiently. 'What's up with Xiao today? He seems different, ' Michael thought.</p>

  <p>Xiao threw a list over to Michael, "Have a look."</p>

  <p>Michael stared at Xiao with confusion on his face and then proceeded to open the list. He discovered that  Luo Zheng Luo was the first name on the list.</p>

  <p>It was the list of results of the registration examination. Generally speaking, the one with the highest score ranked first. When Michael saw that Luo Zheng was the first, he grew even more curious. He then moved his eyes and saw Zheng's result, which was 5 minutes!</p>

  <p>"Heh…" Michael had a really bad cough. "What... 5 minutes? Xiao, did you make a mistake?"</p>

  <p>What was the magnetic stone?</p>

  <p>Excavated from a magnetic mountain, located in the depths of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, it seemed very strange. It was not gold or iron and nothing could destroy it. It couldn't be refined or used for weapon refining either.</p>

  <p>After the World Commercial Alliance received it, they studied it for decades. However, none of the refiners in the Central Region knew what it was supposed to be used for. Finally, they found that it could perceive certain Law Power, which was why they made use of it as a stone for testing.</p>

  <p>Michael tried that magical stone once. Even he was only able to change its color for a period of thirty seconds. Moreover, he saw personally that Hobbes, one of the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance, beat the stone with his sophisticated Fire Palm. However, he could only change the color for a period of one minute.</p>

  <p>Michael began to doubt whether Xiao was playing tricks.</p>

  <p>Xiao looked him straight in the eyes. "Michael, what do you mean by that?</p>

  <p>Is it necessary for me to play tricks?  Luo Zheng Luo has nothing to do with me!"</p>

  <p>Xiao and Michael were the elders of the World Commercial Alliance, but Michael was the leader of the branch, which meant that his status was a little higher than Xiao's. Xiao worked at the headquarters. Even though he was marginalized in recent years, he didn't need to care about Michael's feelings.</p>

  <p>"Well…" Michael was somewhat embarrassed. He tried to diffuse the tension in the room with a smile, "Don't take it to heart. I'm just really struggling to believe it."</p>

  <p>Xiao wasn't angry at all. If he hadn't seen what Luo Zheng did with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe it either. He only focused his eyes on the Picture Slab and said, "My goodness... I've never seen anything quite this strange. He didn't seem to have practiced the cultivation methods with Thunder concerned. Instead, he simply used the power of Thunder Law. I've never seen such a pure power of Thunder Law before."</p>

  <p>Xiao couldn't figure out the reason.</p>

  <p>If a warrior was proficient in the power of some kind of Original Law, he would certainly practice the cultivation method concerning that power. For example, Xiao was proficient in the power of Wind Law, which was why he practiced it, so that he could get the most out of it. It was something that all of the clever warriors did.</p>

  <p>However, since Luo Zheng was so proficient in the Thunder Law, why didn't he practice its related cultivation methods?</p>

  <p>What Xiao said shocked the elders of the World Commercial Alliance and the middle-aged warrior. If Luo Zheng really did that, he surely wasted God's gifts.</p>

  <p>However, they were oblivious and didn't know that Luo Zheng was proficient in more than just the Thunder Law. As a matter of fact, he had grasped the power of nine kinds of Original Laws but only managed to use the power of the Thunder Law on the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>"Even so, it doesn't mean that he could pass the pre-qualifying match and get a place in the main draw match," said the middle-aged warrior, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Michael also maintained his own view, "Indeed. Even though he has already acquired a substantial amount of power of the Thunder Law, his cultivation is far too low."</p>

  <p>Xiao touched his moustache and replied, "I think  Luo Zheng Luo is qualified to enter the main draw match. Michael, let's make a bet."</p>

  <p>Michael laughed. He didn't say anything. He obviously didn't accept the bet.</p>

  <p>While they were talking, the second wave of attacks commenced in the magic array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still studying the points beside his pagoda. He was surprised at the ingenuity of the magic array. After he killed the three-eyed spiders, he got a total of 1, 000 points.</p>

  <p>He didn't count the number of spiders in the fight. It seemed that he had killed exactly 1, 000 spiders, resulting in one spider offering one point.</p>

  <p>These points were the key to getting three places. Most importantly, they could even be used to reinforce the pagoda.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged warrior had also mentioned this rule before. With waves of attacks, the beasts in the magic array would become so strong that warriors wouldn't be able to kill them by themselves. So, that was why they had to make the best use of their points. With the upgrading of the pagoda, its strength would improve and help the guardians.</p>

  <p>"1, 000 points for reinforcement!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng placed all his points into the pagoda without the slightest hesitation.</p>

  <p>Instantly, his points recorded next to the pagoda returned to zero. At the same time, the pagoda was shrouded by a red light. Soon, the red light dissipated, allowing for a new pagoda to appear.</p>

  <p>The reinforced pagoda had risen one meter in height. The edge of the pagoda was inlaid with a golden pattern, which made it even stronger.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there was one more bowman on the pagoda, which meant that there were a total of two bowmen.</p>

  <p>How much could this pagoda possibly be reinforced with more points?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was looking up at his pagoda, a bell rang out in the sky. The second wave of attack was about to begin.</p>
