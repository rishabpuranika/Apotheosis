  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the self-healing ability of the space in the Source World was quite strong.</p>

  <p>The space usually repaired itself quite quickly after it was damaged. To put it simply, the space cracks created by even the mighty warriors of the Other Shore Realm only lasted for a moment before they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>However, Othniel's impact on the space was too much. The dilapidated space was exposed and formed strange scenes.</p>

  <p>"You're just a coward who is good at hiding!" He tried several times, but he failed to touch the man in black every time. Now he felt a little anxious.</p>

  <p>A powerful being like Othniel knew almost everything. There were few secrets that they couldn't understand. Thus, he naturally felt uneasy when he faced an unsolvable problem.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, another ray of cyan light bloomed on his forehead.</p>

  <p>This time, he didn't dodge. His eyes glowed blue, and the space in his head had changed. As soon as the cyan light entered his head, it refracted ninety degrees and ran through towards the other side.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh— "</p>

  <p>The cyan light flew towards the direction where Fuxi and the Snake Goddess located. Although the Snake Goddess dodged very fast, blood flowed out from her strong, graceful leg.</p>

  <p>Still, she remained nonchalant, and she didn't even frown. The injury was nothing to her.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Fuxi's eyebrows furrowed tightly.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Snake Goddess personally reassured Fuxi and told him to not get agitated, but to be patient.</p>

  <p>But it was not Fuxi's style to hold back his emotions.</p>

  <p>"Now that this man in black is here, let's take this chance to kill Othniel together!" Fuxi told the Snake Goddess through telepathy. The Snake Goddess slightly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Even if we managed to kill Othniel by working together, how would we deal with the man in black from the Nihility race?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes only darkened at her question, which was rather rare for him.</p>

  <p>He seldom felt discouraged, because except for the Three Purities Stage, there was no opponent he was afraid of on the Other Shore or in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But the man in black was stronger than anyone he had met before. Fuxi didn't think he had any chance to win against him.</p>

  <p>"There will be a chance," said the Snake Goddess in a gentle voice with a smile in her wise eyes. "Fuxi, be patient."</p>

  <p>No matter how irritable Fuxi was, he would calm down when he heard the soft voice of the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Now, Othniel might have mastered the method to fight against the Cyan Misty Sword.</p>

  <p>A small space stood out and blocked the cyan light whenever it lit up. The cyan light that could pierce through millions of feet deviated due to the reflection of the space.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>However, the cyan light was too powerful. It could extend up to several or even dozens of provinces, and all the creatures in its way would suffer.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Separate Amber Province, the great warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace stared at the mighty warriors of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>Their previous fight had gotten suspended because of Othniel's and Gerald's appearances. Naturally, their battle became meaningless since beings with higher levels of power had arrived.</p>

  <p>The battle would come to an end when the fight between the great warriors at the higher level ended.</p>

  <p>Right after that, however, Gerald suddenly disappeared. A few moments later, rays of immensely strong cyan light began to shoot everywhere.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Holy Soul Realm and the Chaotic Source Realm didn't have a physical body as powerful as the Snake Goddess'. It was bearable if the cyan light hit their hands or feet since they would only lose their arms or legs at most. However, they would die if it hit their heads or chests.</p>

  <p>The two sides who had been confronting each other in the air finally withdrew tacitly and dodged. However, it was useless, because after all, the cyan light bypassed almost any kind of obstructions.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A ray of cyan light pierced through the sky and hit Zheng's body, but it did not puncture him. That was the first time that the cyan sword radiance failed to penetrate something.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's body had blocked it, the cyan sword radiance turned into a pool of liquid that glimmered with cyan light. It did not last long, however as Zheng's body quickly absorbed it.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch had put Zheng above his head to use him as a shield, but he wasn't sure if Zheng could block the cyan light or not.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Zheng was still safe and sound even after the cyan light had hit him, he was utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>'This guy is really extraordinary...'</p>

  <p>"It's a waste of time if you only hide in the dark," Othniel said as he moved slowly. His eyes divided the entire world into blocks, and he shifted his attention to the energy reaction inside those blocks.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the Son of Truth of space. As he continued to observe, he gradually understood how the man in black made it.</p>

  <p>Countless figures flashed inside the space blocks. Those figures were the man in black.</p>

  <p>The man in black did not disappear. Instead, he moved at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>According to the common space rules, one had to create a short distance or even a long distance space channel for the Grand Teleportation or instant teleportation. Only then could they cross from one end to the other end of the space channel.</p>

  <p>However, the man in black didn't need to do that. He could appear at any point then disappear at another point on his accord.</p>

  <p>Even Othniel couldn't do such a thing.</p>

  <p>"You can't possibly refract all my sword radiance, nor can you stay cautious all the time. Just three sword strikes are enough. It's impressive to kill a Son of Truth with three sword strikes," the man in black said from the space.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his sword released more concentrated cyan sword radiance.</p>

  <p>The long sword radiance, which was as thick as a finger, was like a thick thread. While Othniel was at the center, it refracted in all directions like mad.</p>

  <p>In this way, the mighty warriors of the Eternal Realm, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Mahoney, were in a more dangerous situation. The sword radiance came and pierced through them from time to time, and they almost couldn't dodge it.</p>

  <p>Only Yellow Thearch remained unharmed because he placed Zheng above his head as a natural shield.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Like the man in black had said, Othniel couldn't be careful all the time.</p>

  <p>Although he could refract ninety-nine point nine percent of the cyan sword radiance away, there would always be a little cyan sword light left as time went by.</p>

  <p>Finally, one ray of cyan sword radiance dodged Othniel's refraction and punctured his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The second sword strike." The voice of the man in black came again.</p>

  <p>Othniel's face darkened.</p>

  <p>The man in black had just said that he could kill him with three sword strikes.</p>

  <p>Based on the cyan light's lethality, not even thirty or three hundred strikes could cause any substantial damage to him, let alone only three strikes.</p>

  <p>Yet, according to the man in black, there might be some other consequences if the cyan light hit him thrice. Or was it just a threat?</p>

  <p>The Three Purities Stage was a magical place with all kinds of strange abilities.</p>

  <p>At first, Othniel wanted to deal with the man in black slowly while he tried to come up with a solution— but after he felt that things had gotten much worse, he suddenly looked ferocious.</p>

  <p>His eyes suddenly turned into two weird blue energy entities and abruptly exploded. At the same time, a large block appeared covering dozens of miles around the man in black.</p>

  <p>Then the block disappeared, together with the man inside it.</p>
