<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 483 The Way Evan Came On Stage (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For example, the golden bell defense that he had used in the beginning was of no use when faced with Luo Zheng's extraordinarily strong power. After that, he had used the move of the Diamond-like Body, but even that hadn't been able to shake Luo Zheng's spiritual weapon like body at all.</p>

  <p>And then he had tried the Acalanatha Shadow, which was supposed to deliver quite a fight for Luo Luo Zheng since he wouldn't have been able to find a way out.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, out of nowhere, Luo Zheng's sword spirit Lily had showed up with the sword dance, using her malicious Mu Ning to its upmost. Even the Heavenly Punishment Sword was supposed to be no match for the Acalanatha Shadow, but Lily's sword dance had beat it easily anyway.</p>

  <p>It had actually taken Luo Luo Zheng himself by surprise as he didn't have any idea why and how Lily was so powerful.</p>

  <p>And then it came to Patrick's best card? Green Lotus Karma Fire.</p>

  <p>Anyone who saw it would have thrown in the towel immediately. How could a human body stand that furious fire?</p>

  <p>Patrick never could have expected that his best card would turn out to be the reason he would call it quits.</p>

  <p>It just happened that Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid of any kind of fire. Instead, his body craved fire to refine itself and make itself stronger. The Karma Fire was hell to others, but to Luo Luo Zheng, it was like Alice's wonderland. He couldn't like it more; to Patrick's chagrin, he absorbed every bit of it like an alcoholic enjoying a glass of beer.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for that, Patrick wouldn't have lost.</p>

  <p>"Patrick, there's no need to feel frustrated. It's not that I am stronger than you. It just happens that some of your best moves weren't as effective as usual, but that doesn't mean they are not powerful enough." Of course Luo Luo Zheng could understand how upset Patrick was. Anyone in his shoes would feel the same. As a warrior, he didn't want his opponent to feel upset.</p>

  <p>But to his surprise, Patrick suddenly closed his eyes and took a deep breath with his palms pressed together in front of him. When he opened his eyes again, his face had suddenly become much calmer. "Life is like a river and the Buddhist path is like a raft. Make the best use of the raft and it will take you to the shore. How can I reach the shore if I get upset just because of one failure? Thank you, Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Karma lies in one's destiny. It was a eureka moment for Patrick after experiencing all the coincidences and witnessing the unusuals these days.</p>

  <p>He was wise and clever because he had been an Acalanatha in his previous incarnation, and this meant he could get to understand more of the Buddhist Dharma through many trivial things in life. Now his heart was like a calm and still lake again.</p>

  <p>He turned around and told the referee, "I give up."</p>

  <p>The referee nodded at him, pleased with Patrick's calm intake of defeat, then announced the results of the All Peaks Competition, "Luo Luo Zheng from Drizzle Peak won and Disciple Patrick lost."</p>

  <p>After the announcement, one of the elders came onto the stage and announced the Cloud Sect ranking.</p>

  <p>The audience erupted in a buzz of conversation as the results were announced. After the fight going his way just now, it was Luo Luo Zheng who now ranked first among all the disciples. While everyone was busy talking about the results, suddenly there was a flash of white light in the south.</p>

  <p>It was coming straight towards the stage at a furious pace from far away like a shooting star moving across the night sky.</p>

  <p>As everyone stared at it, it got closer and closer.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Patrick stared at it too. When it was only a few miles away, they realized the flash of white light was actually a man flying with the force of his life vitality. The problem was that now he was only a couple of hundred feet from the stage, but he showed no sign of slowing down. It looked like he was going to crash onto the stage head first.</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet, three hundred feet, one hundred feet from the stage...</p>

  <p>"Hey, watch out!" Luo Luo Zheng wanted to warn him, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>"Crash!" There was a loud noise.</p>

  <p>The man in the white light crashed head first right into the stage. But he didn't stop? the inertia made him roll over and over again on the stage floor like a ball. Finally he stopped and rose to his feet. Since he had landed head first, his neck looked very weird, tilted to one side in a strange way, like it had been broken. But the man held his head with both of his hands and twisted it with a sharp crack. It sprang into position again and now, he looked relaxed and comfortable.</p>

  <p>The young man, in his twenties, looked handsome in some ways but not all. There was something strange about his features? his eyes, nose, and mouth somehow didn't look right together, and sometimes they even seemed funny.</p>

  <p>The way he had showed up in front of everyone was embarrassing, even shameful. But no one was going to laugh at him or doubt his strength.</p>

  <p>Anyone else who had hit the floor head first would have died immediately of blunt force trauma; but this young man had survived unscathed, which was clear proof that he was no ordinary person.</p>

  <p>Patrick let out a sigh. The man had a habit of always showing up in such unusual ways, causing absolute chaos. But still, he greeted him politely,</p>

  <p>"Nice to see you, Evan."</p>

  <p>So that was it! The young man was actually Evan Li, the real top disciple of the Cloud Sect ranking and supposedly the most powerful disciple in the entire Cloud Sect.</p>
