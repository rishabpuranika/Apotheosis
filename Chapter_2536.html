  <p>
</p>

  <p>The blood wild bone required inheritance.</p>

  <p>The unimaginably enormous bone towers at the bottom of the chaos almost fully belonged to the clans that had the same blood as that contained in the bones.</p>

  <p>As a result, these forces occupied a large area of the Immemorial Wilderness. The number of wild bones they had accumulated in the past countless years was unimaginable to ordinary people.</p>

  <p>But these clans didn't care about ordinary wild bones at all. The only wild bones that caught their eyes were bones of their own blood, and since these clans were rich, they often spent a lot of money on them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's wild bone, which was huge in size, was particularly enticing.</p>

  <p>"What kind of blood is hidden in this piece of wild bone?" asked one of the middle-aged men.</p>

  <p>With a calm look on his face, Luo Zheng replied, "You can see for yourself."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man immediately stood up and strode over to Luo Zheng, his eyes fixed on the blood wild bone.</p>

  <p>With a few flicks of his fingers, he made a series of knocks on the surface of the wild bone.</p>

  <p>Soon, a wave of blood-red Wild God Power appeared.</p>

  <p>'The method he used to extract the Wild God Power is different from what Zelda used, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Zelda had used the Trickle Spring Method. But even though Luo Zheng had no idea of what method this man was using, the result was the same.</p>

  <p>The blood-red Wild God Power slowly spread out, circling around and turning into the shape of a wolf.</p>

  <p>Looking at the little blood-red wolf, the three middle-aged men cried out in unison.</p>

  <p>"The Spirit Wolf God!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's it!"</p>

  <p>"What a coincidence! Haha!"</p>

  <p>Excitement appeared on the three middle-aged men's faces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't understand what they meant, so he asked, "Why do you say it's a coincidence?"</p>

  <p>"The Blood Wolf Clan in the Northern Leaning Bone Tower has been looking for the wild bones of the Spirit Wolf God, so the price of the wild bones of the Spirit Wolf God has risen greatly!" answered the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>Blood wild bones were comparatively rare, so people who dug them out would choose to hoard them until they could find a suitable opportunity to sell them later.</p>

  <p>When some elders and masters of the Blood Wolf Clan started to buy the wild bones that contained their blood without restraint in order to break through the bottleneck, these blood wild bones would be sold at a high price.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see." Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was still a bit worried.</p>

  <p>Zelda had warned him that if the Falcon Caravan set their eyes on this kind of blood wild bone, they would try to kill him for it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, an auction house in Sand Core City would not do such a thing.</p>

  <p>The truth was, Luo Zheng did not have the strength to keep this blood wild bone. What if they really wanted to get their hands on it?</p>

  <p>But as the three middle-aged men enthusiastically helped him estimate the base price of this wild bone, Luo Zheng realized that he was worrying too much.</p>

  <p>A piece of blood wild bone was of great value, but the auction house belonged to a big force in the bone tower, so this piece of blood wild bone was not enough for them to take at the risk of damaging their reputation.</p>

  <p>"Normally, one piece of wild bone of the Spirit Wolf God can be exchanged for 50 ordinary wild bones," said one of the three men. When he said one piece, he meant a fist-sized part, which was the average size of an ordinary wild bone. "But now, due to the Blood Wolf Clan, I guess that it can be exchanged for more than 65 ordinary ones!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's blood wild bone was as tall as a person and shaped like a triangle.</p>

  <p>The man measured it up, and then said, "Your blood-red wild bone can be dismantled into 200 fist-sized wild bones. The base price can be set at 12, 000 ordinary wild bones. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"12, 000?!" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>According to what Zelda had said, Luo Zheng had roughly calculated that his blood wild bone could be exchanged for about 10, 000 ordinary wild bones. He had never expected that these middle-aged men's valuation of it would be higher than hers.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the middle-aged man continued, "This is just the base price. If it is auctioned at the auction house, anything could happen; the final price may be far higher than this price."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, but then another doubt came to mind. "Since only members of the Blood Wolf Clan can absorb this kind of wild bone's power, why would other people bid for it?"</p>

  <p>One of the middle-aged men was stunned by Luo Zheng's question and the naivety it betrayed.</p>

  <p>Another one of the men grinned and explained, "It's useless for others to bid for it. They don't have the Spirit Wolf God's blood, and they simply can't absorb its power. However, the Blood Wolf Clan is willing to obtain the Spirit Wolf God's wild bone at any price, no matter how high it is. So obviously, anyone who buys that wild bone can make a sizeable profit off of it. But this is not something we can control or interfere in!"</p>

  <p>Deals between two powerful clans involved many problems.</p>

  <p>Even if an ordinary person found a blood wild bone, they could only sell it. Later, through a series of transactions, it would finally go to the big clans.</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Then, he left the wild bone in the cubicle and followed the woman who had fair and clear skin.</p>

  <p>Now, she was much politer. "Our auction house can arrange a lounge for you. You can wait for the result there or participate in the auction."</p>

  <p>"Participate in the auction? No." Luo Zheng shook his head slightly.</p>

  <p>The truth was, he couldn't participate even if he wanted to. He had absorbed almost all of the wild bones he had picked, so he had no wild bones left to buy things.</p>

  <p>Seeming to have guessed what Luo Zheng was thinking, the woman smiled and said, "There is a rule in our auction house. If the blood wild bone of the Spirit Wolf God is sold out first, you can directly use the wild bones you will get to bid on the auction items. We can calculate the balance afterward."</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile. "In that case, I want to see what valuable items are on auction today."</p>

  <p>"I can arrange a seat for you," the woman said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Zheng entered a wide hall.</p>

  <p>It was still early, so there weren't many people in the hall. Luo Zheng found a seat in the corner of the hall and sat down before closing his eyes, waiting for the auction to start.</p>

  <p>An hour later, people began to enter the hall one by one.</p>

  <p>Those who could participate in the auction here were the most respected people in Sand Core City and their strength was much more powerful than the ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's gaze swept over these people, he noticed that about seven of them were exuding great Wild God Power. These people were much more powerful than the four people he had met in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the hall became lively. Everyone talked loudly as they waited.</p>

  <p>Deciding to take this chance, Luo Zheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.</p>

  <p>"It is said that there will be several major items in this month's auction!"</p>

  <p>"Hey! I heard that the Heaven Core Bone Tower and the Moon Orchid Bone Tower are fighting again!"</p>

  <p>"On the eve of the war, the price of wild bone will soar. It's so pitiful for us..."</p>

  <p>'The Heaven Core Bone Tower and the Moon Orchid Bone Tower...</p>

  <p>Do great forces in this world also have wars among each other? It seems that wars happen frequently in this world, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, an old man dressed in glorious clothes, his hair loose, came from the side of the hall and stood on the stage. With a quick glance, he said, "Everybody, welcome to the monthly auction at our Sand Core City!"</p>
