<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1473 The Shake Of The Heavens </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The experience of walking along the road of stars was indescribable.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Xun could not help but size up the surrounding stars.</p>

  <p>Those countless stars were densely packed. No one knew what method Livingston had used to imprint the stars in the previous round of heavens and condense them into a star plate of this size.</p>

  <p>Similar to the stars that Zheng communicated with, the sizes of these stars differed greatly from one another.</p>

  <p>Some of the stars were several dozen or even a hundred times larger than a person. However, most of the stars were like tiny grains of sand, extremely tiny.</p>

  <p>"Hm?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked along the road of stars, he noticed a small azure star floating beside him. It was only the size of a fingernail. Nonetheless, it was extremely beautiful as its surface seemed to be covered by a sea. It was just that it was so tiny, so Zheng couldn't see its surface clearly.</p>

  <p>Other than this tiny star, there was also a fireball that was countless times larger than it.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful!" Xun exclaimed.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng was about to reach out and grab the azure star, Livingston at his side stopped him. "There are many stars in the star plate and every single one of them is very important. They are part of the Milky Way. Thus, you can't take them away."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders. He let go of the small azure star and continued to walk forward.</p>

  <p>Although the road of stars didn't seem long, he realized that it was indeed very long while he was walking. Livingston's body was clattering as he led them. Thus, they were walking really slowly.</p>

  <p>It took about an hour for Zheng to realize that the distance between him and the center of the Milky Way was not getting any shorter.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take for us to walk like this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, crossing this half of the star plate at this speed will take about two days and two nights. Back then, I spent hundreds of years building the star plate, and every star was completed..."</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes. He did not wait for Livingston to finish speaking before he grabbed Livingston and started sprinting on the road of stars.</p>

  <p>Now he had to make the best use of his time. He must be nuts if he followed Livingston's pace.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Zheng had crossed over half of the star plate and arrived at the center of the Milky Way. There was a massive sphere of light, emitting blinding scarlet rays.</p>

  <p>The sphere of light was around 10, 000 feet wide. The sand-like stars that surrounded it were almost negligible.</p>

  <p>"Is this the sun of the last grand era?" Zheng questioned as he stared at the huge ball of light.</p>

  <p>The sun was the most dazzling star in the universe. It was so bright that it made all the other stars surrounding it dim whenever it glowed. None of the stars there could outshine it.</p>

  <p>Livingston nodded and fiddled with a star on the plate.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the light of the sun gradually dimmed. It was just then that Zheng noticed a hidden palace within the sun!</p>

  <p>"Follow me. This palace is the core of the Reincarnation Plate. Osborn started cultivating here many years ago. Maybe he hasn't died yet," said Livingston.</p>

  <p>Nervousness showed on Zheng's and Xun's faces as they heard those words.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be good for them if Osborn was still alive. No one knew what method Osborn had used to cross a grand era. Everyone knew that even a Supreme Lord would find it difficult to endure the mass extinction at the end of a grand era. Since this sort of thing had happened, it was likely that Osborn was still alive.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Plate?" Xun spoke after thinking for a moment.</p>

  <p>Livingston slightly nodded. "The Reincarnation Plate is a space tool I made. We are currently in the Reincarnation Plate."</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Plate is the Endless Abyss?" It was Zheng's turn to ask.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right." Livingston smiled.</p>

  <p>Xun and Zheng finally understood that the underground palace was actually a space tool. Thus, it wasn't a wonder that they experienced a lot of odd things there.</p>

  <p>An empty palace welcomed Zheng when he followed Livingston. There wasn't any sign of Supreme Lord Osborn or his remains.</p>

  <p>It had been a very long time after all. Supreme Lord Osborn's body would have turned into ashes if he really passed away here.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Wandering around the empty palace, Livingston shook his head and said with disappointment, "Osborn, you have gone ahead of me and entered the six paths of reincarnation."</p>

  <p>Xun also walked around, checking on some of the divine textures in one of the palace corner. "Are these divine textures used to control the Reincarnation Plate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Livingston nodded.</p>

  <p>"Since the plate is a space tool, does that mean we can fly away with its help?" Xun followed up with another question.</p>

  <p>Livingston smiled at her. "Of course. The Reincarnation Plate that I refined is more than that. You are underestimating the number one weapon refiner in the universe!"</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes suddenly lit up at his words.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng's gaze fell upon a strange object floating in the air above a large throne at the side of the palace.</p>

  <p>It was similar to a headband, but also looked like a crown. It was made of neither gold nor iron. Its surface was emitting a faint golden light. The strange phenomenon of it floating in the air attracted Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>Unable to stop himself, Zheng reached for the crown and asked, "What is this?"</p>

  <p>Xun and Livingston were talking about the control over the Reincarnation Plate when they heard Zheng's voice. Thus, they both turned their heads to him. As Xun saw the crown, her eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>However, she immediately thought of something even before she could open her mouth. Confusion flooded her face when she subconsciously said, "Zheng! Don't touch that!"</p>

  <p>Livingston also said, "This is strange. Why does this thing stay here?"</p>

  <p>However, Xun was too slow. It was already too late when she stopped him. Zheng's fingers already touched the crown and before they could even get themselves ready, it suddenly started to tremble.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the round of heavens in the universe began to shake.</p>

  <p>Several tens of thousands of supreme worlds away, a Supreme Lord that was in a deep slumber suddenly opened his eyes. His cultivation method was very special, he cultivated by sleep.</p>

  <p>Now a new chaotic world had begun, many Supreme Lords didn't waste time and began to cultivate. This Supreme Lord was no exception, but when he woke up, his eyes were filled with bewilderment as he looked at the sky and the stars.</p>

  <p>"The round of heavens is trembling. Why is this happening?! Are we going to have a new Supreme Lord?" The Supreme Lord was amazed.</p>

  <p>"The one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords are all in their positions. How could there be the hundred and twenty-ninth one?! It is impossible! No one can forcefully be one of us!"</p>

  <p>He was not the only one to be shocked. In fact, all of the other Supreme Lords in the universe were looking up at the sky in confusion too. What was happening before them exceeded their scope of knowledge.</p>

  <p>There was no Supreme Lord in this universe at the beginning of a new grand era. Therefore, there was no one to bear the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>But as millions upon millions of years passed, the universe, which had suffered the mass extinction, began to give birth to new life forms.</p>

  <p>The races were slowly established and evolved in the span of hundreds of millions of years due to various reasons.</p>

  <p>Then, a competition started.</p>

  <p>There was a limit to the number of the Supreme Lords that bore the Heavenly Destiny. As the saying went, the early bird caught the worm.</p>

  <p>At this point, whoever could surpass the world lord level would be bestowed the title of Supreme Lord and be able to bear the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Humans were at the forefront in this grand era under this new round of heavens called Cosmos. Thus, humans had the highest number of Supreme Lords. With the Supreme Lords of the three great human forces added together, the Supreme Lords of other races were far from matching this number.</p>

  <p>In a perfect situation, nobody would be able to become a Supreme Lord anymore since there were already one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords. Even if other martial artists surpassed the world lord level, they shouldn't be getting to the Supreme Lord level anymore. They would have to wait for the Supreme Lords to die first before they could seize their Heavenly Destiny and become new Supreme Lords.</p>
