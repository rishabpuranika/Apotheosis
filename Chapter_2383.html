<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black spears aimed at the crowd, turning all the faces of the consummate True Gods ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>Even Walton, who was lazily lying down, stood up and stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods had witnessed the power of the black spears before.</p>

  <p>Both Mikail Sword, the consummate True God of the Sword Clan, and Troy had been shot by those spears before. Mikail Sword had instantly died when the black spear pierced him.</p>

  <p>Troy, on the other hand, had been fortunate enough to survive, but even though he had recuperated for a long time, the wound caused by the black spear still hadn't healed completely.</p>

  <p>When these fatal countless black spears shot out, how would all the consummate True Gods escape?</p>

  <p>Rachelle didn't speak. She still held the machete tightly, unwilling to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>She was far more stubborn than ordinary people, and she would not yield even when facing death.</p>

  <p>At this moment, her body bent slightly and a great surge of power went through her long and slender legs. She leaped high in the sky, taking the arc of a parabola as the machete in her hand came at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Huh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly before he disappeared.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's machete missed its target and landed on the ground. Before she could steady herself, Zheng reappeared in front of her again.</p>

  <p>But this time, he had a handful of sand in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he saw Rachelle come up again to attack him, he threw the sand at her.</p>

  <p>"Kill..."</p>

  <p>The thin lines of sand swept off Rachelle's wrist, leaving bloody cuts.</p>

  <p>The impact of the sand also made the machete fly out of her hand.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Shahn and Walton rushed over.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>They had barely taken a few steps when two black spears shot out and pierced the ground in front of them.</p>

  <p>They instantly froze.</p>

  <p>The time in the area that the spears had pierced passed quickly and the originally fine sand turned into dust.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Since she didn't have the machete in her hand anymore, Rachelle abruptly turned around and released another surge of power, aiming straight at Zheng's face with her knees!</p>

  <p>She had almost unleashed all of the power of the nine stars in her body.</p>

  <p>There weren't many people in the divine land who would be able to resist this blow.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng just raised his hand and casually deflected her attack.</p>

  <p>Then, without missing a beat, he released his own surge of power, knocking Rachelle's body to the ground.</p>

  <p>After that, handfuls of sand flew toward Rachelle's hands and legs.</p>

  <p>Although she had released more power in an attempt to stand up, it was to no avail— the sand had firmly fixed her onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng did not completely control the jade seal, after he had broken through the first light curtain, the extent of his control over this world was not much different from the extent of his control over his inner world. And since no one could use Godly Ways in this world, the consummate True Gods here were no match for him.</p>

  <p>Kneeling on the ground, Rachelle couldn't even raise her arms.</p>

  <p>"If we were outside, you wouldn't be able to take even one move of mine!" she said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on his face, Zheng slowly walked toward Rachelle. He half-squatted down and grabbed her chin, raising her beautiful and angry face. "But here, you can't even withstand a single move of mine."</p>

  <p>Rachelle was forced to look up at Zheng, a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>She had never been insulted like this before.</p>

  <p>At this moment, her stunning face was almost completely distorted in anger, revealing a different kind of beauty in her.</p>

  <p>If she had nothing to bind her, she would probably have pounced on Zheng and devoured him by now.</p>

  <p>"Actually... If I let you go just like this, I will be very upset," Zheng said, looking down at Rachelle.</p>

  <p>When they heard Zheng's words, many of the consummate True Gods' eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>They were all very clear that their lives were in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>And from what Zheng had said just now, it had sounded like he was going to let them go!</p>

  <p>"Just as you said, I am far from being a match for you if we are not in this time and space." Zheng continued, his eyes fixed on Rachelle. "But don't forget, I am just a low-rank True God. There's still a chance for us to meet again in the future."</p>

  <p>Then, he stepped back.</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of his hand, the light curtain equipped with the black spears outside the Heavenly Wheel Temple disappeared.</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng stretched out his hand and pointed at the ground, where a colorful circle of light appeared.</p>

  <p>"That's the passage to leave here..."</p>

  <p>"Is he going to let us go?"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods were surprised. They had almost completely believed that they were done for.</p>

  <p>Before stepping into the circle of light, Zheng said, "I am arranging some insects in the circle of light, so if you enter this passage now, you will be devoured clean by them. However, three days later, I will remove all the insects. You can leave then. Look out for yourselves!"</p>

  <p>With that warning, he stepped into the circle of light and disappeared from everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>In the time passage, one's corporeal body would be pulled into a special state. Under such circumstances, even consummate True Gods would be unable to fight against those insects.</p>

  <p>Walton thumped the ground, producing a huge sandpit.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I will make you regret it if you fall into my hands one day," he cursed angrily even though Zheng was no longer there to hear him. He couldn't believe that a mere low-rank True God could be so arrogant.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng left, the sand that was binding Rachelle fell down, but she remained kneeling motionlessly on the ground.</p>

  <p>With her head down and her dark hair covering her face, it was hard to see her expression.</p>

  <p>Drops of blood dripped down her lips and sank into the sand.</p>

  <p>Shaking his fan, Shahn frowned as he looked at the colorful circle of light. "It seems that the kid is under certain pressure and doesn't dare to kill anyone."</p>

  <p>Troy, who had been silent all this time, nodded. "From what he said, it seemed that there was really something that held him back from killing us."</p>

  <p>"He must have reached an agreement with the Holy Emperors! Maybe he threatened the Holy Emperors with our lives and fled the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>Shahn guessed, holding the fan.</p>

  <p>However, Troy shook his head. "That's impossible. My father wouldn't be threatened by a low-rank True God!"</p>

  <p>"Then why did he let us go?" Shahn asked, feeling puzzled.</p>

  <p>"We're trapped in this world and we barely have any information. I wonder what's happening outside. Let's talk about it after we get out of here three days later," said Troy, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>When Zheng returned from the jade seal, he told Joy, "Everything is arranged. They will soon escape from that circle of light. We can't stay here for too long."</p>

  <p>Three days in the jade seal was only equivalent to an hour in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Joy nodded her head. She planned to leave this place with Zheng again using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a token and said, "Although the divine land is vast, there are still some risks. Why don't we just hide in the fairy palace for some time?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had been in the divine land for a while now, but he had never returned to the fairy palace during this time.</p>

  <p>Joy looked at the mountain token in Zheng's hand and raised her eyebrows in surprise. "Bromley's fairy palace in the Swirl Forest?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>She thought for a while before nodding back in agreement.</p>

  <p>Although Bromley's fairy palace was not unbreakable, it was indeed a good place to temporarily take refuge in.</p>

  <p>Once Joy agreed, Zheng activated the mountain token in his hand.</p>

  <p>Soon, the surrounding space started to vibrate slowly.</p>

  <p>The space in the divine land was several times stronger than that of the universes.</p>

  <p>In the universes, it only took him a split second to enter the fairy palace, and it was convenient. But in the divine land, it was difficult for the mountain token to break through space. It was only after about half a minute that the mountain token dragged him and Joy into a space channel.</p>

  <p>Soon after, they appeared at the gate of the fairy palace.</p>
