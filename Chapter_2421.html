<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan was a relatively peaceful race in the divine land.</p>

  <p>At the very least, they rarely caused any disputes in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact they were the second-ranked clan, they had no use for violence. They were very devout in their belief of kindness.</p>

  <p>They expected every member to cultivate his or her mind to not kill indiscriminately or be bloodthirsty. Therefore, the clansmen were extremely humble and righteous beings.</p>

  <p>However, those who knew the Sword Clan knew of the terrifying strength hidden behind the humble exterior.</p>

  <p>"It's not uncommon for members of the Sword Clan to die when they cultivate in the Killing Zone. You must not force yourselves. If you cannot hold on, crush the Sword Card in your hands, and our clan members will rescue you." Bill glanced at the crowd and waved his hand, adding,</p>

  <p>"Remember, in the Killing Zone your killing intents will be ignited, but you cannot kill each other. If you attempt to do so, the Sword Clan will not be kind. Does everyone understand?"</p>

  <p>Paying little heed to the warning, the large group of True Gods charged into the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>The dark-skinned man glared coldly at Zheng before entering.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked unhurriedly to the back of the queue.</p>

  <p>As Bill watched them enter the zone, an emerald bird spiraled down from the sky toward him.</p>

  <p>A small jade slip hung from its feet.</p>

  <p>Bill stretched out his hand, and the bird perched atop his wrinkled finger.</p>

  <p>"Tweet, tweet, tweet!" it chirped.</p>

  <p>A look of doubt appeared on Bill's face as he unbuttoned the jade slip.</p>

  <p>"Hayden's letter? The kid has just taken office as the lord of the Famous Sword Divine City and no longer caused any trouble. He has been quiet for the past few days. What could the letter be about?"</p>

  <p>"Clank!"</p>

  <p>Bill crushed the jade slip in his palm, and a flash of thought flew out.</p>

  <p>"How could this be? Someone in the Famous Sword Divine City has got twenty-three swords?"</p>

  <p>It was rare for someone of the Sword Clan to be able to get twenty-three swords.</p>

  <p>"His name is  Zheng Luo.  Zheng Luo..."</p>

  <p>Bill murmured the name several times.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I've heard this name somewhere before..."</p>

  <p>Bill's eyes popped open in surprise moments later.</p>

  <p>"The man who holds the number 9400 Sword Card!</p>

  <p>Zheng, the one who had caused trouble to the Floating Islands several years ago!"</p>

  <p>As one of the seven elders and a consummate True God in the Sword Clan, Bill had seldom done business on the Floating Island. Instead, he resided in the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The story from the Floating Island, however, had spread out to his domain.</p>

  <p>Significant happenings such as that even reached as far as where he was.</p>

  <p>The name jogged Bill's memory of when the Floating Islands were re-ranked.</p>

  <p>It told of an anonymous warrior, the Time Sea Forbidden Land, and the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Mikail, one of the seven elders of the Sword Clan, had died in the jade seal.</p>

  <p>In response to Mikhail's death, two of Bill's comrades had asked of Zheng's location in their rage.</p>

  <p>When a member of the Sword Clan died outside of their own land, the body should be taken back to the Sword Clan and buried, no matter the distance in between.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to bury a member of the Sword Clan in other places, especially a consummate True God like Mikail in this instance.</p>

  <p>They only heard from Zheng that Mikhail died. How could the Sword Clan allow one of their elders to die casually?</p>

  <p>Glancing at the dark entrance, Bill felt the impulse to rip Zheng out and demand an answer.</p>

  <p>He had to restrain himself though.</p>

  <p>Unlike the past debates over the Godly Ways, this time the situation of the Sword Clan was the most important.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped into the Killing Zone, there was a strong change of the momentum.</p>

  <p>Actually, the moment Zheng had entered the Non-combat zone, he had felt a great momentum radiating from it. It was so irresistible that the True Gods would be unable to gather the slightest amount of killing intent.</p>

  <p>Even when he entered the Killing Zone, the momentum still existed, but it wasn't what he had expected it to be. The momentum was encouraging him to release his killing intent, not suppress it!</p>

  <p>A nearly overwhelming desire to fight ignited in Zheng's blood.</p>

  <p>"What a massive difference!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of this momentum, there was a faint impulse in the back of Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>He wanted to burn his life and use his strongest strength.</p>

  <p>"Is this the other side of the Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>This feeling was slightly similar to what Zheng had felt when he performed the Emotion Closing Godly Way, but in reality they were completely different.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be similar to the Murdering Godly Way, but there was still a difference.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was infused with two kinds of opposite power, which was very eerie.</p>

  <p>While pondering these thoughts, Zheng walked slowly down the steps into the tree hole.</p>

  <p>The tree hole was inside the main stem of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The surface of the Sunrest Tree's main stem was very large, so the inner world must be too big to imagine. Could it be that the whole core of the Sunrest Tree was the Killing Zone?</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The True Gods ran along the wide tree hole as quickly as possible, distancing themselves from one another.</p>

  <p>After walking a long distance, Zheng sped up.</p>

  <p>The first part of the journey went unchanged.</p>

  <p>As they traveled deeper into the hole, vines inched out of the wooden surface.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! Don't get tangled up in those vines!"</p>

  <p>"They are the spiritual roots of the Sunrest Tree. Don't try to destroy them if you get caught!"</p>

  <p>Just as a True God gave out the warning, a swishing sound cut through the air.</p>

  <p>The huge hole was like the belly of a monster. All the vines waved in time with each other, and swept towards the True Gods all at once.</p>

  <p>If the creatures in the divine land were to be ranked, the four great divine trees would be the top creatures in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Among the four great divine trees, three wouldn't attack any living beings on their own, especially the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>If warriors cultivated on the Sunrest Tree, they'd be able to feel its strong life energy. Under its nourishment, the warriors could promote their cultivation speed immensely.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Zheng watched many of the Sword Clan members stab their swords into the tree to cultivate.</p>

  <p>But as this was the Killing Zone, some parts of the Sunrest Tree were affected by the Truth of Godly Way. This area was extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>Countless vines spread at an incredible speed, and almost instantaneously a majority of the True Gods were ensnared.</p>

  <p>"Whish! Whish!"</p>

  <p>A scream caught Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>A short distance from Zheng, a top-rank True God's feet were tightly wrapped up in the vines. Suddenly, seven to eight vines curled around him so tightly that no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape.</p>

  <p>The more the top-rank True God struggled, the stronger the vines became.</p>

  <p>In no time, a crunching sound came from him. The vines had snapped his bones.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Now desperate, the top-rank True God had no choice but to break the Sword Card. He did not dare move anymore. Realizing their prey was still, the vines stopped moving and didn't get any tighter.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at the scene before him, but the sound of rustling overhead caught his attention. Several vines, like the tentacles of an octopus, formed a complicated net and came at him from different directions.</p>
