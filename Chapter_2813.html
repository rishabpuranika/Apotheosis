<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But if it wasn't the Sea of Truth, then what was it?</p>

  <p>In the void, Zheng was still trapped by the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he thought it was his end. As he had seen that Clark was burnt by the flames released by red lotuses, there was no reason to believe he would survive.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that the golden Sanskrit words on his body lit up at an unprecedented speed.</p>

  <p>But this time, the situation was slightly different from the usual.</p>

  <p>As he continued to absorb the flames released by the red lotuses, his five senses suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>He realized that he could no longer see or hear anything, as if his soul had completely left his body.</p>

  <p>By the time he regained his consciousness, he was already in this crimson sea.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>He could hear the sound of his body as it plunged into the sea. Strangely, he felt no pain when he soaked in the magma sea.</p>

  <p>But every time he tried to move, he felt an indescribable pain from inside his body.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this place?"</p>

  <p>Wanting to leave the crimson sea and head for the sky, Zheng tried to use his internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Jumping out of the water, he was determined to leave the sea.</p>

  <p>Just then, he felt the magma sea pulled on him firmly, as if it had a life of its own.</p>

  <p>"I can't get rid of it!"</p>

  <p>Surprised, Zheng's eyes widened. The magma turned into sticky glue, and he was stuck.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>After some standoff, Zheng fell into the magma sea again.</p>

  <p>Soon, he also discovered that he would stay afloat even if he didn't swim.</p>

  <p>There was a strange buoyant force keeping him on the surface, so he didn't have to make any efforts to swim his way above the water.</p>

  <p>"Those brain masters were wrong. My master is always right. He has never made any mistake."</p>

  <p>During that moment, Zheng heard No. 9527 talking in his mind.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527?"</p>

  <p>Zheng abruptly rolled around the sea.</p>

  <p>He could feel a nauseous wave of pain breaking over him as long as he moved slightly on the sea.</p>

  <p>Hearing No. 9527's voice, Zheng was so excited that he forgot how his body ached. His body was now swollen, and he couldn't help but cry out.</p>

  <p>"Where are you?" Zheng asked again, hoping he would get a response.</p>

  <p>He already realized that No. 9527's consciousness came from his deep brain, not from his chest.</p>

  <p>"I'm still inside your body," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to me? Why did my soul leave my body?" Zheng found a whole line of questions he needed to ask.</p>

  <p>"No, it's not like that," No. 9527 replied. "It is more like your body that left."</p>

  <p>"What? My body left? How could that be?" Zheng's curiosity grew as that was not the answer he was expecting.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, one's soul could leave through acupoints. But now he was being told that his body was the one who left his soul. How was that even possible?</p>

  <p>"It's just a metaphor," No. 9527 clarified.</p>

  <p>"Where am I? Am I at the Sea of Truth?" Zheng raised another question, confused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are at the Sea of Truth," No. 9527 confirmed Zheng's guess. "But this is not a normal Sea of Truth. It's likely that no one has stepped into this Sea of Truth for many years."</p>

  <p>Splash, splash!</p>

  <p>An ancient aura covered the crimson magma sea. Looking at the boundless Sea of Truth, Zheng felt like he was as tiny as dust.</p>

  <p>"Only those practicing the Ancient God Cultivation Method can step into this Sea of Truth, right?"</p>

  <p>Figuring out what No. 9527 meant, Zheng asked to confirm.</p>

  <p>Timotheus once told him that the cultivation method of the ancient gods was about absorbing the wild bones and cultivating the Wild God system.</p>

  <p>And the ancient gods could also cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Yes," No. 9527 responded quickly.</p>

  <p>"But there are so many warriors practicing the Wild God system at the bottom of the chaos. Even those powerhouses who have reached the Other Shore Realm also absorb the wild bones for body refining. How come none of the Wild Gods has been able to step into the Sea of Truth even after so many years?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He previously asked Timotheus about it, but he didn't get an exact answer.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 paused for a while, as if it was thinking. After a while, it replied,</p>

  <p>"The truth has been altered. As a result, it is impossible to enter the Sea of Truth just by absorbing the wild bones. However, my master said that you were an exception."</p>

  <p>No. 9527's master, known as the Chaos Ancient God, had previously chosen numerous targets in the prison built by Herbert, but none of them had passed the test before.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, it was Zheng, an outsider, who was able to pass the test in the end. They considered it a coincidence.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is because of my body refining skill?" Giving it a thought, Zheng was personally curious to know why.</p>

  <p>"I guess so," answered No. 9527 with a slight smile. "Although I'm a part of my master's soul, I really have no idea on what he thought exactly. But now it appears that his judgment is absolutely right. You've already taken the first step in the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 explained everything so calmly, but Zheng could hear the excitement coming from its voice now.</p>

  <p>In No. 9527's perspective, Zheng was still a nobody, but he had a special characteristic which made him different from any other persons.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Zheng started hearing the sound of waves.</p>

  <p>From where he was at, he could see an indistinct shadow of a small boat rowing on the Sea of Truth. A shadowy figure was standing on the head of the boat.</p>

  <p>The boat emitted a strong Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, which Reinhard of the Sword Clan had used before, if Zheng remembered it correctly.</p>

  <p>"What kind of boat is that?" Zheng asked, looking back.</p>

  <p>"That is the Truth Boat that crosses the sea. I think it won't be long before you also take the same path," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>According to the Grand World Cultivation Method, Zheng needed to reach the limit of Godly Way, grasp the Truth of Godly Way, make a Truth Boat, and cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash, splash!</p>

  <p>Several other Truth Boats appeared.</p>

  <p>Their indistinct shadows all sailed on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Why are so many people crossing the Sea of Truth?" Astonishment was written all over Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>According to the information he got from Timotheus, Emily and the others, there were a lot of powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World, which meant many people had crossed the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng couldn't imagine that there would be more than ten people sailing on the Sea of Truth in such a short time.</p>

  <p>After thinking about it for a while, No. 9527 concluded, "It's a bit strange.</p>

  <p>Maybe the disciples of some great force in the Source World are trying to reach the Other Shore Realm at the same time."</p>

  <p>At that moment, one of the boats seemed to come a bit closer to where he was.</p>

  <p>The shadow on the Truth Boat suddenly shouted, "Look! Look! I can see someone in the water!"</p>

  <p>His loud voice was transmitted far away on the sea. Soon, the people on the other Truth Boats who heard him instantly turned their gazes at the same direction.</p>

  <p>"There's someone floating in the Sea of Truth? Stop talking nonsense. Wait.</p>

  <p>What the..." Seeing Zheng's figure in the sea, another man was stunned and was lost for words.</p>

  <p>"Is he planning to cross the Sea of Truth with his physical body? I have never heard of anything like that. It's so..." the shadow on another Truth Boat commented in an incredible voice.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was right.</p>

  <p>This group of people, currently sailing, were disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>This time, the Oneness Sky Palace opened the Sword Sky Road for its disciples to comprehend. Out of the 490, 000 inner disciples who embarked on the sky road, only sixteen had mastered the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, made their own Truth Boats and sailed towards the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>They could not see each other's real appearances but could see each other's vague shadows and hear each other's voices as they sailed across the Sea of Truth. Unlike Zheng's perception of the sea being a crimson magma, these disciples perceived the Sea of Truth as a brilliant sea of stars.</p>
