<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1487 The Moving Fairy Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two Demon Night warriors were a man and a woman. The man was called Maddox, and the woman was called Tanya.</p>

  <p>They were Yao's most capable subordinates, and their strength was on par with Viveca, Aneisha, Salvador, and Elspeth.</p>

  <p>However, since the two warriors had followed Yao all these years, the benefits they had obtained were naturally much greater than those of the latter four.</p>

  <p>The weapons in their hands were both supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>The crystal sword in Maddox's hand was called Infinite Crystal Sword.</p>

  <p>As long as he was strong enough, he would be able to turn the crystal sword into two, then into four. The stronger he was, the more crystal swords he would be able to divide. Each crystal sword would have the same power as the original one.</p>

  <p>On the Universe Spirit Tablet, the Infinite Crystal Sword was currently ranked the 2, 120th.</p>

  <p>As for the weapon in Tanya's hand, it was a machete called Slash. The machete's weapon refiner was a man with a very strange temperament.</p>

  <p>He had made only a few weapons, each of which was named with one word and was listed in the top 3, 000 in the Universe Spirit Tablet rankings. Moreover, every weapon also contained a Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>When Tanya waved the Slash, the cold glint on the blade suddenly became so bright that no one could look at it. It was as if a star had been embedded on the surface of the machete.</p>

  <p>With a wave of the machete, Tanya sent forward an attack.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The blade light spread out in the shape of a fan, making it seem as though a gigantic fan had appeared in the vast sky.</p>

  <p>Anything that came within the range of the light would be cut in half.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality in Slash was very similar to that in the pickax named Black Star. However, the Law of Causality in Black Star was penetrating everything while that in Slash was cutting everything in half.</p>

  <p>Tanya had intentionally brandished the machete in such a way so as to cut the Reincarnation Plate into two.</p>

  <p>However, when the fan-shaped light had extended enough to almost touch the Reincarnation Plate, the enormous plate suddenly rose to a higher altitude, dodging the attack in an extremely strange manner.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng was the one who was controlling the Reincarnation Plate. He couldn't avoid the densely-packed crystal swords, but he had the confidence to avoid the slowly-spreading blade light. He was not an idiot who knew nothing but to run as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sight, Maddox couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was so large, yet Tanya had missed her target. It was indeed a joke.</p>

  <p>Tanya had never thought that the Reincarnation Plate would be able to dodge her attack even though it was riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of anger in her eyes as she snorted coldly. Then, she crazily swung Slash around in her hands.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The machete in her hands transformed into rings of light, followed by dozens of blade lights. With Tanya at the center, they spread out, and this time, the speed of the blade lights was a hundred times faster. Moreover, some of these blade lights were vertical, some were horizontal, and some were slanted. There were no blind spots at all. Even Maddox had to step back to avoid being grazed by these blade lights.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A sound that could make anyone's head ache echoed out from within the Reincarnation Plate. The blade lights were unstoppable and instantly cut the massive Reincarnation Plate into several pieces.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was because the blade lights were too sharp� the Reincarnation Plate kept flying forward out of inertia even after it had been cut into several pieces. However, a few more thin lines appeared on the surface of the plate. It flew like this for a period of time before the plate began to disintegrate bit by bit into giant, shapeless pieces that floated and rolled in the air.</p>

  <p>One of the gigantic fragments of the plate was slowly rotating in a spiral, and Luo Zheng had his feet firmly nailed to it. His entire body rolled along with the fragment, but his gaze was always directed at Maddox and Tanya. He even had a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"This is the brat!" Maddox announced, taking a look at Luo Zheng. "Xun is his sword spirit, so she is within his body."</p>

  <p>"Kill him first," Tanya said coldly. In her eyes, this young man at the Soul Sea Realm was only a novice who had just set foot on the road of cultivation. There was no need to waste words on him, and following Yao's orders would always be the first priority.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, the token of mountain appeared in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Instantly, it transformed into a mini-sized fairy palace, and his figure disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Tanya was slightly stunned. "There's another space tool?"</p>

  <p>Space tools were not very common, so Tanya and Maddox hadn't expected Luo Zheng to have another small space treasure to hide in after the Reincarnation Plate was destroyed.</p>

  <p>"It is a waste of time," Tanya added quickly, shaking her head. Without any hesitation, she headed straight for the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>However, just as she was about to charge over, she saw that the fairy palace was flying forward at an extremely fast speed, faster than she could comprehend.</p>

  <p>"How can this space treasure be so ridiculously fast?" Maddox raised his eyebrows as well. It was obvious that the scene in front of him was nothing like anything he'd seen before.</p>

  <p>Both of them were top world lords. They were one of the few beings in this grand era that had an acute understanding of the Space Law. They just hadn't obtained any Crown of Destiny; otherwise, they could become Supreme Lords too.</p>

  <p>And yet, the tiny fairy palace was somehow several times faster than them. In the blink of an eye, there was a great distance between them and the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"No matter how fast you are, it's useless!"</p>

  <p>Snorting again, Tanya swung her machete down, tearing apart space.</p>

  <p>With a single step, she crossed several hundred miles of space, accompanied by the Space Law Power.</p>

  <p>Maddox did the same. With a single step forward, he teleported and stood right in front of the small fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The speed of the fairy palace was indeed extremely great, but in the end, it was still flying within space. Compared to the two of them who could cover hundreds of miles in just a single step, it was still a lot slower.</p>

  <p>"Break apart!" Seeing the fairy palace heading straight for her, Tanya swung Slash straight at it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Not only was the small fairy palace extremely fast, but it was also agile.</p>

  <p>The fairy palace made a ninety-degree turn in the air, avoiding the might of Slash.</p>

  <p>However, just when it managed to dodge the large blade, it was met with Maddox's crystal swords. The densely-packed crystal swords poured down like beautiful but deadly rain. Surprisingly, the fairy palace maneuvered through the rain of swords without coming into contact with a single crystal sword.</p>

  <p>After escaping Tanya's and Maddox's interception, the fairy palace continued to fly away. The two warriors once again teleported through space to intercept it.</p>

  <p>They were growing increasingly impatient with Luo Zheng, who kept managing to slip through their fingers even after being chased and intercepted so many times.</p>

  <p>They had destroyed the huge Reincarnation Plate so easily that they had never thought that they would be unable to deal with the small fairy palace. The fact that there was nothing they could do about it was a great humiliation to them.</p>

  <p>Inside the fairy palace, Luo Zheng was standing on a square. Saul was standing behind him. In front of them was a crystal wall, and on the crystal wall was an image of the outside world.</p>

  <p>To be more accurate, what was outside the fairy palace was not a part of the universe at all; it was a place unknown to Luo Zheng. The real outside world had been blocked by the enchanted barrier that was being released from the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The small fairy palace which was being pursued was nothing more than an illusory manifestation of the real fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we can't get rid of them." Luo Zheng looked at the image of the two Demon Night warriors chasing after him on the crystal wall.</p>

  <p>Saul smiled slightly. "Luo Zheng, there's no need to worry. These two have comprehended spatial transference, so the fairy palace can't flee by flying alone. However, we don't need to be afraid of mere world lords.</p>

  <p>Even if the fairy palace remained motionless, they wouldn't be able to break through it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He still didn't know how to resolve this crisis, but at the very least, he was able to guarantee his own safety as well as Xun's.</p>

  <p>Right now, all he could do was take one step at a time and see how long Yao could pester him like this.</p>

  <p>The chase lasted for about two days, and the distance between them and a bright yellow star in the Middle Sky Region was getting closer and closer. This whole time, although Maddox and Tanya were pursuing them with all their might, they still couldn't do anything to this small fairy palace.</p>

  <p>However, just at this moment, a streak of black smoke appeared behind the two of them. As the black smoke rolled over, a giant hand reached out and grabbed at the two of them.</p>
