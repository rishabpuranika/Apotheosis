<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1654 Three Hundred Stars </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the moment, the warriors in the blood-red hall were engaged in fighting with all their might.</p>

  <p>Only a very small number were able to battle with relative ease.</p>

  <p>Nathan was one of them.</p>

  <p>He had in his possession a number of Illusion Points, so the statue that he consolidated was much stronger than those of the others. If he was eliminated, the others would probably be eliminated as well.</p>

  <p>Nathan was like a living legend.</p>

  <p>He had experienced many hardships since he was a child. When he was born, the stars were triggered by him. To the Xuanyuan Clan, this was an auspicious sign.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan only belonged to a distant branch of the large Xuanyuan Clan.</p>

  <p>This phenomenon, which had originally been an omen of fortune, had instead brought him great trouble.</p>

  <p>One of the main branches of the clan had found his own in the shortest amount of time. They replaced Nathan with another baby and planned on drowning the real Nathan...</p>

  <p>However, since Nathan was favored by the heavens, he possessed great luck that ordinary people did not have, even if he was just a baby.</p>

  <p>Not only was he saved from getting murdered, he also grew up in a special environment. In the end, he became the Godly Genius of the Xuanyuan Clan and avenged himself on those who had harmed him in the past.</p>

  <p>Although Nathan was confident, he was also full of distrust because of his complex childhood.</p>

  <p>So far, he had been with no woman around him.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the four large clans of the Thoughtless Minds, once the Godly Geniuses and ace talents reached a certain age, they needed to get married. However, every suitable match was rejected by Nathan. Rumors were rife that he was possibly homosexual and only interested in men.</p>

  <p>From not far away, he heard Margaret's words and sighed with emotion.</p>

  <p>He had never met such a woman before...</p>

  <p>Wave after wave of beasts surged over.</p>

  <p>Two thousand and five hundred warriors had been present in the three blood-red castles at the beginning, but now the number had started to drop rapidly.</p>

  <p>Two days and two nights later, most of the warriors were exhausted. The beasts finally stopped their attacks.</p>

  <p>At the moment, only three hundred warriors occupied the blood-red lobbies. About ninety-percent of them had been eliminated in this round.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Illusion Battlefield were incomparably cruel, its final goal aimed at choosing the main character who could lead the world of chaos...</p>

  <p>In the first stage, only two thousand and five hundred warriors among the trillions of participants could win and subsequently enter the second stage.</p>

  <p>In the second stage, only three hundred would be selected out of the two thousand and five hundred candidates.</p>

  <p>In this sort of competition, the final survivors would undoubtedly be the ace talents and Godly Geniuses of the various races.</p>

  <p>These three hundred warriors were destined to become the most dazzling stars in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the roofs of the three blood-red castles opened up and fused together, forming three massive arched bridges. In the middle of these three castles, a thick purple light column rose up. Inside the light column were many fish. The momentum of the heavens and the earth spreading out was formidable enough to make most people scared.</p>

  <p>Only one hundred warriors were left in each of the blood-red castles.</p>

  <p>Now that the castle was open, they leapt onto the bridge and headed for the purple light column in the center.</p>

  <p>"It's time for us to go over," Luo Zheng said to Mu Ning, who was in his arms.</p>

  <p>She had not even glanced at the purple light column as it appeared. She was still cuddled up against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded slowly and followed Luo Zheng onto the bridge.</p>

  <p>The strongest warriors of the fifty supreme worlds had all gathered there.</p>

  <p>As they stood there, observing the fish swimming in the purple light column, they quietly observed each other as well.</p>

  <p>Some of them, such as Nathan and Lawson, already knew each other from before.</p>

  <p>Others had distinctive features, such as Karl. He wore a heavy armor, his face reflecting the righteousness he felt. With just a single glance, one could tell that he was the Godly Genius of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng was famous.</p>

  <p>However, only a few warriors had actually seen him...</p>

  <p>Before he could even get close to the purple light column, someone wielded his sword and came to stand before him.</p>

  <p>"This is surprising. I had thought that with your minimal strength, you wouldn't even be able to enter the second stage. I didn't expect you to successfully enter the second stage and not be eliminated at all in the process... Interesting! Very interesting!"</p>

  <p>The dark colored iron sword in this particular warrior's hand was unremarkable and even a bit broken.</p>

  <p>He waved the sword in front of Luo Zheng with a proud demeanor. He was none other than the Otherworldly Swordsman whom Luo Zheng had met in the Hall of Causality before.</p>

  <p>Standing not far away, when Nathan heard the Otherworldly Swordsman's words, his eyes flashed...</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman came from the Thoughtless Minds and had participated in the competition of the four clans, so Nathan naturally knew of him. But he was also curious and wondered how Luo Zheng had managed to offend the Otherworldly Swordsman.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the Otherworldly Swordsman's voice, everyone looked at him.</p>

  <p>They had all heard of the Otherworldly Swordsman and his mystical sword...</p>

  <p>He seemed to hold a grudge against the warrior, seeing as how he was so intent on provoking Luo Zheng with his arrogance. However, none of them knew what had actually happened.</p>

  <p>Hearing the Otherworldly Swordsman's words, Luo Zheng was indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it is interesting. On my part, I will at least give you a chance..."</p>

  <p>"What? Give me a chance?" The Otherworldly Swordsman was slightly stunned at the words.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a chance to eliminate me," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>The others were astonished at his words.</p>

  <p>Even though the Otherworldly Swordsman was only an ace talent from the Thoughtless Minds, he could be as powerful as a Godly Genius if he made use of his magical sword!</p>

  <p>The other warriors present wondered who the young warrior standing before the Otherworldly Swordsman was.</p>

  <p>His arrogance was proof enough that he despised the Otherworldly Swordsman, who was indeed remarkable.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? I must thank you for giving me this opportunity!" The Otherworldly Swordsman's eyes were full of anger. Defeated by Luo Zheng in the Hall of Causality, he was extremely indignant. To him, his failure in the Hall of Causality had been a great insult and he wanted to get back at Luo Zheng for it.</p>

  <p>Because of the conversation between the Otherworldly Swordsman and Luo Zheng, several warriors turned their heads to where they were...</p>

  <p>At some distance stood a woman in purple. Her skin white like snow, she was very pretty. She was Lucille, who had lost to Luo Zheng previously.</p>

  <p>When she saw Luo Zheng, she strolled over to him as soft snowflakes fell around them. Her eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng as she said, "We meet again."</p>

  <p>After entering the second stage of the Illusion Battlefield, Lucille, who practiced the One Soul in Two Bodies, had taken the opportunity to merge her two beings. The present Lucille was in her true and complete form, her temperament also slightly changed.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>The moment Mu Ning saw Lucille's beautiful face, she held onto Zheng's right arm tightly. Her eyebrows knitted together as she stared at Lucille with a wary expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Noticing the intimacy between Mu Ning and Luo Zheng, Lucille was a bit surprised and guessed that they were in a relationship. However, she had no idea where Mu Ning had come from.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could say anything, another warrior greeted him, "Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The warrior carried a sword on his back. He looked confident and energetic, with a pair of sharp eyes. He was Hua Tianming, who had finally reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Tianming!"</p>

  <p>A smile rose on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Meeting Mu Ning and Tianming here had come as a true surprise to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was delighted at the pleasant happenstance.</p>

  <p>Only after they heard Tianming call out Zheng's name did the other warriors realize that the person in front of them was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, both the Otherworldly Swordsman and Lucille, who had fought Luo Zheng before, were surprised.</p>

  <p>Ever since Lucille had entered the Illusion Battlefield, she had triumphed over the others. She had only been defeated by Luo Zheng so far.</p>

  <p>However, she did not expect the warrior to be none other than Luo Zheng, who often told stories through the Roaring Token.</p>
