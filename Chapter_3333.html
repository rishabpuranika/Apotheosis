  <p>
</p>

  <p>After merging with the Civilization Artifact, Luo Zheng headed for the other end of the Other Shore with Feng Ge and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had been confused, but she decided it was better not to ask questions. Instead, she meekly followed Luo Zheng's lead.</p>

  <p>Once they made it to the other end of the Other Shore, Luo Zheng went straight to the auction house of the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>There, he found them moping desolately; they had even stopped the auction. They took a hard blow when they opened the Grand Sky Temple for exploration last time, which lowered their morale considerably.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy emerged from the Grand Sky Temple, she had returned the Souls of Light of the Ear Mice to them. Nobody knew how the latter would help the said Souls of Light withdraw from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng and Dorothy approaching, the Ear Mice perked up a little.</p>

  <p>However, when they saw Feng Ge with them, they were all surprised. Their whiskers wiggled in curiosity.</p>

  <p>Eager to know more about this elegant lady's background, they pestered Luo Zheng with countless questions about her. But Luo Zheng refused to answer, and Feng Ge herself ignored them as well.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng had cut to the chase. He told them why they were really there: to remove the Soul Binding Thread from Dorothy. To his pleasant surprise, the Ear Mice cooperated enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>While the Soul Binding Thread was quite troublesome, there were multiple ways to remove it. The Ear Mice took out a mysterious liquid and sprinkled some on Dorothy. After they waited for around an hour, the Soul Binding Thread gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to pay the Ear Mice with soul pills, but they firmly refused.</p>

  <p>Although they had failed in the exploration of the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice thought it would be good if they made friends with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Luo Zheng was the spokesperson of Tianxing. Whether they were one and the same person, it didn't matter. What was important was that the Ear Mice could communicate with Tianxing through Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice gently reminded Luo Zheng that when the Bearing race tried to buy information from them about Luo Zheng's body, they had refused.</p>

  <p>While the reputation of the Ear Mice wasn't great, Luo Zheng believed them.</p>

  <p>After all, he knew they were only after communication with Tianxing. To the Ear Mice, the benefits that Tianxing would bring them would be far greater than the riches offered by the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>After this, Luo Zheng took Feng Ge and Dorothy back to the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Unless they were in a temple or the Dark Region, Souls of Light could easily withdraw from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But this time, the circumstances were different.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had entered the Other Shore with her Soul of Light, but after she became a purified being, she now had a body.</p>

  <p>In essence, she was still a soul on the Other Shore, and her real body was still in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew if she would be able to leave the Other Shore. What would happen to the purified being's body after she made it out of the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>"Do you still remember the Illusion Breaking Rune?" Luo Zheng asked gently.</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Breaking Rune? What's that?" Feng Ge asked, blinking confusedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had expected this. Luckily, the Illusion Breaking Rune wasn't difficult to learn. He patiently taught her the spell, and she obediently learned and recited it.</p>

  <p>Dorothy watched this scene silently, recalling what happened in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng just arrived at the Sea of Truth, he didn't even know what the Illusion Breaking Rune was. Back then, it was Dorothy who taught him the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>When they were trapped in the Dark Region, she was allowed to leave.</p>

  <p>However, this depressed her a little bit. She'd have preferred to stay in the Dark Region, if it meant she could be by Luo Zheng's side. Even if this meant becoming a fool, like what happened to Feng Ge, she would have been willing to go through it all to be with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Snapping back to reality, Dorothy turned to watch Feng Ge remaster the Illusion Breaking Rune. Although Feng Ge's memory was an absolute mess, she was still talented.</p>

  <p>After reciting it a few times, she had fully mastered it.</p>

  <p>With her eyes closed, Feng Ge sat still and activated the rune.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge? Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook her by the shoulders gently, but received no response.</p>

  <p>He and Dorothy exchanged surprised looks.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Feng Ge's Soul of Light had left the Other Shore, but her body as a purified being remained there.</p>

  <p>"We should leave, too," Dorothy suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>No matter what, the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace was safe.</p>

  <p>Even if there was trouble brewing, the other Souls of Light were probably not strong enough to hurt Feng Ge's unconscious body.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>In the room on the second floor of Luo Zheng's house, Feng Ge moaned as she slowly opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yudie and Margaret exchanged excited glances. Then, they both turned to stare at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"She woke up!" Yudie cried excitedly.</p>

  <p>"How about Luo Zheng? Is he awake?" All of a sudden, all of their worries revolved around their beloved husband.</p>

  <p>Margaret rushed to Luo Zheng's side. She didn't care whether Feng Ge had woken up or not. Luo Zheng was all that mattered to her in this moment.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge frowned.</p>

  <p>She sat up and stretched awkwardly. In a low voice, she muttered, "This body is so weak..."</p>

  <p>The purified being's body back on the Other Shore was much stronger than her own. Naturally, she felt a little uncomfortable with her old body.</p>

  <p>However, the purified being's body was an item from the Other Shore, so she was unable to bring it back to the Source World. If she merged with that body as an Other Shore Token, she could bring it to the Source World, but her soul was in the purified being's body... This was complicated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just returned to his physical body when he heard Margaret's and Yudie's anxious cries.</p>

  <p>With a smile, he reached out his hands to them.</p>

  <p>Yudie and Margaret were caught off guard. They screamed for joy and pounced onto Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They didn't say anything more and just leaned on Luo Zheng's chest, quietly enjoying the serenity.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had also woken up at this point. Opening her eyes to this scene, she felt a little awkward.</p>

  <p>She had stayed in the Flow Sword Sect for a while, so she knew about Luo Zheng's wives. However, even then, she felt a little depressed watching him coddle them.</p>

  <p>"Hey, why are you hugging him?" Feng Ge's cold voice cut through the air.</p>

  <p>Her memory was still jumbled up; she didn't remember anything about the Taiyi Heaven Palace. In fact, Luo Zheng was the only thing she was sure of.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yudie and Margaret in Luo Zheng's arms, Feng Ge narrowed her eyes in irritation.</p>

  <p>Yudie gave her a funny look, but didn't answer.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Margaret glared at Feng Ge in disgust. In her eyes, this was the woman who had put Luo Zheng through all that trouble on the Other Shore. Actually, he had almost died there! How dare Feng Ge question her haughtily?</p>

  <p>"So, what if I hug him? Luo Zheng is my husband!" Margaret said indignantly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked slowly, as if ruminating the meaning of the word "husband".</p>

  <p>Then, as though it suddenly dawned on her, her eyes flashed and she suddenly yanked Luo Zheng towards her. "From now on, he is my husband. You are not allowed to touch him."</p>

  <p>Margaret's jaw dropped dumbfoundedly. She looked at Feng Ge as though she was an idiot.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yudie was very perceptive. She sensed something was off with Feng Ge. Turning to Luo Zheng with inquisitive eyes, she silently asked him for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Dorothy buried her face in her hands and sighed helplessly. This truly was such a mess.</p>
