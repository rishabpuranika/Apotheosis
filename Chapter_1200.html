  <p>
</p>

  <p>This Dragon Lineage Archer was a mere puppet, but he was designed to be the best archer there ever was.</p>

  <p>The moment the puppet's gaze landed on him, Luo Luo Zheng immediately felt shivers run down his spine as if he was a sheep currently being stalked by a deadly wolf.</p>

  <p>"Will you die if he shoots you?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>It was a given that a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's body was even stronger than a Soul Sea Realm one, and Luo Luo Zheng was curious just how much more resilient the former was compared to the latter.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Brianna retorted angrily. "His bow is a semi-divine weapon, but his arrows are true divine weapons. How could I possibly block them with my physical body?"</p>

  <p>'Arrows of the divine tier...' The astonishment was apparent in Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>It was truly evident that the Dragon Lineage Human indeed had an eighth-grade sacred place when even a puppet guard wielded a divine weapon. It was no wonder that the black arrow light had been so glaring.</p>

  <p>That shiver he had felt before now escalated to a full-body chill as an uncomfortable feeling of wariness pooled in his gut.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the golden sea, the Dragon Lineage Archer had already notched a black arrow onto the semi-divine longbow and took aim.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed in contempt and braced himself to charge towards the archer. However, Brianna suddenly spoke in his mind. "Are you just going to charge? Using just my life vitality and my body to kill him? Just like that?"</p>

  <p>"What else can we do?" he told her.</p>

  <p>A Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's life vitality and physical strength would be enough to crush a Soul Sea Realm warrior. Despite being fierce, the Dragon Lineage Archer would still be nothing compared to Luo Zheng's speed.</p>

  <p>"But to activate... Hey!" Luo Luo Zheng did not give her any room to argue and quickly charged towards the archer.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's attacking! He just charged towards the statue!"</p>

  <p>"I hope he destroys that thing in one go! May the heavens bless us!"</p>

  <p>"Stop talking nonsense! If the heavens really did bless us, then what's the point of Heavenly Tribulations?!"</p>

  <p>"That statue is taking aim at Luo Luo Zheng! I hope he'll miss."</p>

  <p>All the Soul Sea Realm warriors watched with rapt attention as the agile figure of a young girl flew across the sky and swooped down with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes zeroed in on the Dragon Lineage Archer below who let his arrow loose towards the approaching opponent.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The black light shot towards Luo Luo Zheng who suddenly leaped and spiraled into the air.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>There were three consecutive explosions as the black arrow continued shooting towards Luo Luo Zheng at a terrifying speed.</p>

  <p>It grazed past his ear and the air current that it carried smacked Luo Luo Zheng in the face. Even a Spirit Supreme Realm body felt the pain from the arrow's momentum.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Brianna snarled. It was still her body after all.</p>

  <p>"My apologies, but your face is too tender," Luo Luo Zheng chuckled.</p>

  <p>At that moment, countless blue arrows intersected his path. These ordinary blue arrows were inferior to the speed Luo Luo Zheng flew at.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's approach quickly pushed the Dragon Lineage Archer to retreat.</p>

  <p>Even as a puppet, he was intelligent enough to understand strategy.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Luo Luo Zheng realized that the Dragon Lineage Archer couldn't fly; nor did the archer rely on his life vitality to stand on the water's surface. Stone pillars had been submerged just under the surface of the water that the archer used to jump to and from the area.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but imagine a dragonfly skimming across the surface of the sea as the puppet jumped onto these pillars to run away from him.</p>

  <p>But of course, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't just about to let him off.</p>

  <p>Distance was an archer's greatest ally. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had gotten too close, the archer was now desperately trying to widen the space between him and his target. Of course, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to let that happen.</p>

  <p>Tup! Tup! Tup!</p>

  <p>Both of them rapidly bounced off the surface of the water. Luo Zheng's legs were tense as his body flew horizontally. He focused his life vitality in his hands and watched as it solidified into a thin blade.</p>

  <p>This life vitality contained the rules of the inner world that existed within Brianna's body. The visualized blade was a provisional measure for Luo Luo Zheng to deal with the puppet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was relentless with his chase and the Dragon Lineage Archer quickly realized that this fellow would truly never quit. Knowing this, the archer suddenly stopped and steadied himself on a stone pillar. He then stomped his foot down and golden waves splattered all around him, disrupting Luo Zheng's line of sight.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this, the archer once again drew out an arrow, now planning to shoot Luo Luo Zheng at a distance of just three feet.</p>

  <p>Before the golden spray fully settled, Luo Luo Zheng had found himself facing the Dragon Lineage Archer head-on. He stared at the black arrow aimed at him with conviction.</p>

  <p>"Haha, die!"</p>

  <p>The archer spoke! And he was speaking the human language!</p>

  <p>However, there was no time to dwell on this. The archer suddenly released his grip on the bowstring, and Luo Luo Zheng saw how the black beam quickly approached his face.</p>

  <p>His reaction was quick: just a slight tilt of his head had been enough for the arrow to brush past his ear and miss him. A faint smile appeared on his face at his successful dodge. "I won't die that easily!"</p>

  <p>This black arrow had three stages of acceleration. After three explosions, it would be enough to kill even a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. Luckily, it was neither powerful nor fast enough to threaten Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Frustrated at missing his target, the Dragon Lineage Archer brandished his longbow and swung it towards Luo Zheng's neck, fully intending to use the bowstring as his blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly reached out and grabbed the bowstring using Brianna's delicate fingers.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>Although he managed to stop the bowstring from cutting off his head, it still cut his fingers and made blood spurt out from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Can you be more normal? This is still my body!" Brianna scolded, thinking that Luo Luo Zheng did not value her body at all because it wasn't his. If it weren't for the cyan dragon, she would've definitely pulled his soul into her inner world and ravaged it.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the case at all. Luo Zheng's own physical body was invulnerable to swords and spears, so he got used to dealing with enemies in such a brutal way. He forgot that although Brianna was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, her body was still made of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>However, he chose to remain deaf from Brianna's nagging. Instead, Luo Luo Zheng pulled on the bowstring and released it as fast as lightning.</p>

  <p>The bowstring bounced back and let out a strange hiss as fish scale-like ripples appeared on the surrounding sea surface.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Archer froze in his spot as his scarlet eyes stared intently at Luo Luo Zheng. Not much later, a thin line appeared on his neck before his entire head slowly slid off his body.</p>

  <p>The cut was clean and the puppet seemed to have been made of some sort of soft jade. Just as the head slid down onto a stone pillar, Luo Luo Zheng quickly reached out to take the bow and arrows from the puppet's body.</p>

  <p>He would be crazy to just throw away a semi-divine longbow and a quiver of divine-tier arrows into the sea.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to take the valuables, the Dragon Lineage Archer's body suddenly moved. It seemed losing his head did not make him any less agile. The body quickly drew out a black arrow from the quiver and intended to stab Luo Luo Zheng in the face.</p>

  <p>Just as he brandished the arrow, a loud explosion rang throughout the vicinity. The headless puppet's arm quickly went slack and moved no more.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, smiled. He lifted his foot and quickly crushed the Dragon Lineage Archer's head beneath him.</p>
