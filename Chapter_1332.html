<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1332 The State Sword </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Space, the combatants, Luo Luo Zheng and Fenton, were maintaining a cautious distance from each other.</p>

  <p>The large and small wind blades collided together at this moment with a shower of sparks.</p>

  <p>In power and size, these two wind blades were completely opposite.</p>

  <p>Fenton's was infused with the strength and power of metal. It was exceptionally sharp, seemingly able to cut through anything in the world, slicing it to pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's wind blade seemed to be an ordinary one, with only a few fragments of sword light emanating from it in occasional flickers.</p>

  <p>So, from the bystanders' perspective, it was like a lion pouncing on a helpless rabbit. It seemed obvious who was going to win the fight.</p>

  <p>The instant the two wind blades collided, an ear-piercing sound rang out in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>It was the sound of the wind blades colliding with each other.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the power hidden within Luo Zheng's cyan wind blade suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>The cyan wind blade became like a ferocious beast. The moment it collided with the golden wind blade, it bared its hidden fangs and attacked.</p>

  <p>In just a split-second, the golden wind blade was completely defeated, as it was utterly engulfed by Luo Zheng's cyan wind blade.</p>

  <p>But after that the terrific cyan weapon's momentum didn't decrease at all, even continuing to roll back towards Fenton to pursue the attack.</p>

  <p>In the Dragon Tiger Hall, witnessing this scene, the martial artists of the Myriad Spiritual Force House were silent for a moment before a tumultuous uproar broke out.</p>

  <p>"Th-this is..." someone stammered, too stunned to finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? Fenton already has the fourth layer of Wind Law while Luo Luo Zheng has only the third. How is it possible that Fenton has been defeated by Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Moreover, the cultivation method that Fenton practices is something special. He has also completed the fourth layer of the Metal Law. Thus, he is much more powerful than before."</p>

  <p>In the uproar, all of the martial artists' mouths were left wide agape.</p>

  <p>Some of the martial artists even vigorously rubbed their eyes, as if they couldn't believe what they had seen.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place suddenly stood up and stared blankly at what was happening in the Illusion Space. Disappointment and chagrin were evident on his ancient features.</p>

  <p>The other elders of the sacred place were also left silent and dispirited.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? How could this happen?" asked the Saint Lord, frowning as he stared at the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng indeed only has the third layer of Wind Law, but now it seems he is much more powerful than that."</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord and the elders had already mastered the fifth or even the sixth layer of Law Power. They knew completely how powerful each layer of the Wind Law was. Even with the force of other cultivation methods, Luo Luo Zheng shouldn't have been able to harness such immense strength.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were even more shocked by the scene than the talents of the Myriad Spiritual Force House. Confusion reigned in the Dragon Tiger Hall as the spectators tried to understand how these unlikely results had occurred.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong thought for a long time before finally frowning and saying,</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the third level Wind Law. Even if Luo Luo Zheng had used a special martial skill or technique, he still wouldn't have been able to launch such a powerful attack against Fenton. This is simply impossible!"</p>

  <p>Elder Gong clearly thought Luo Zheng's sword attack was impossible. The problem was that this "impossible" scene had played out right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, the Saint Lord suddenly slapped the violet gold chair he was sitting in, instantly turning the armrest of the chair into smoke. He had always been gentle and refined, but now he lost his composure as he cursed, "Damn, I've lost this time!"</p>

  <p>The elders looked at the Saint Lord in silence, sighing in their hearts.</p>

  <p>They had indeed suffered a terrible loss.</p>

  <p>When the thirteen palaces of the alliance had asked them to send Luo Luo Zheng over, the Saint Lord had paid special attention to him. He had been trying to figure out why they had requested Luo Luo Zheng, while Fenton was a much more experienced and accomplished fighter.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had ascended to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, but now the thirteen palaces wanted him. This would displease any sacred place.</p>

  <p>After all, there were also some talents among the figures who had ascended from the Lower World. They were worth their training.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when one was serving in the mines, the cost of becoming an independent warrior was much higher than joining the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Joining the sacred place required 100 life vitality jades, but being independent and free would cost 200 life vitality jades. The extra 100 pieces were the cost of borrowing the Ascending Well. After all, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place had built a channel for the ascending, and they had dug many more Ascending Wells to help the ascending figures to get used to the pressure of vitality between heaven and earth. None of those could be used free of charge.</p>

  <p>Countless sacred places in the Upper World were doing the same thing. It had a certain economy to it which enabled the ascension process.</p>

  <p>After knowing that Luo Luo Zheng had been selected, the Saint Lord had been observing him carefully. He hadn't noticed anything strange in the past, believing that Luo Luo Zheng was at most born with an innate godly strength. But that wasn't enough to make the Spiritual Force Sacred Place pay any special attention to him. Since the thirteen palaces wanted him, the Saint Lord would just send him over. Clearly, Luo Luo Zheng had not been a significant cultivator when compared to the other talents.</p>

  <p>That was why the Saint Lord had wanted Fenton to challenge Luo Luo Zheng. It would give an excuse to recommend Fenton to the thirteen palaces. With Fenton being accepted, it would add much more prestige and funding to the pot.</p>

  <p>Now the Saint Lord realized that he had made a huge mistake.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed not an ordinary warrior. There was a reason why the thirteen palaces had chosen him. Yet the Saint Lord had been blind to his potential!</p>

  <p>Of course, the Saint Lord could not refuse the thirteen palaces' request for Luo Luo Zheng. However, he could have asked for an enormous reward from the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Saint Lord was extremely conflicted. Now that he saw the strength that Luo Luo Zheng had displayed, he wouldn't get anything other than jealousy. After all, it wouldn't be appropriate for him to ask the thirteen palaces for anything now that the deal had been sealed.</p>

  <p>He was incomparably depressed when he thought of the loss.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong let out a long and heavy sigh and said, "However, we can still use this opportunity to send Fenton to the thirteen palaces."</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord understood what Elder Gong meant. In fact, he had already thought of this notion a moment ago. The alliance wouldn't refuse if the sacred place sent Fenton together with Luo Luo Zheng to the thirteen palaces for free.</p>

  <p>In other words, Fenton entering the thirteen palaces was a sure thing, but so what? The Saint Lord still felt that he had suffered a great loss. If they accomplished that, it would be nothing more than a slight compensation.</p>

  <p>It was far from enough to cover his loss.</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Space, after Luo Zheng's wind blade had crushed Fenton's wind blade, it continued to attack Fenton.</p>

  <p>Fenton hadn't expected to lose to Luo Luo Zheng, so when he saw the wind blade sweeping towards him, his usually calm face was filled with astonishment and a flicker of fear. When the wind blade began to harass him, he flung his body backward, and started to frantically retreat. Luo Zheng's wind blade mercilessly pressed the advantage.</p>

  <p>The shattered jade sword in Fenton's hand began to reform as he retreated. He swung it five or six times to fend off the attack before he finally dissipated Luo Zheng's wind blade.</p>

  <p>Though the two of them had exchanged blows, Fenton hadn't suffered any substantial damage, but his warrior spirit was deeply wounded.</p>

  <p>Every successful warrior had a certain arrogance which was usually well earned, but Fenton had just met his match and was brought low for a moment.</p>

  <p>Fenton was far-sighted and broad-minded, but incredibly proud. He might treat others kindly, but that was only if they didn't hurt his pride, or if they didn't pose any threat to him. He was so proud that he didn't even bother to flaunt his pride.</p>

  <p>But now, that pride in Fenton's heart was shattered by Luo Zheng's attack. His eyes were filled with confusion, and he couldn't stop asking himself why he had lost. That strike had completely shattered all of his long held beliefs that he had accumulated over the past years.</p>

  <p>It didn't make sense!</p>

  <p>However, in the blink of an eye, Fenton suddenly bit into his own arm.</p>

  <p>The bite was extremely forceful, and blood instantly flowed out of the teeth marks, the intense pain instantly clearing his mind. The contempt within his heart for Luo Luo Zheng completely disappeared, and was replaced by a serious attitude. He knew now that he was facing a great enemy. Fenton was a professional and was not about to give up.</p>

  <p>"You're really strong.</p>

  <p>The thirteen palaces have shown good judgment. I was wrong.</p>

  <p>Among the younger generation in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, you are the only one that I have had to fight using my full strength,"</p>

  <p>Fenton said. After he had finished speaking, he took out the jade sword which he had stored in the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>The State Sword was a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The moment he held the sword in his hand, a strange red light burst forth from the blade. When the red light reached Luo Zheng's eyes, he sensed a majestic Mu Ning. This Mu Ning seemed to emanate from the life force of billions of creatures, and Luo Luo Zheng felt both strange and awed.</p>
