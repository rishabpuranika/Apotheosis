  <p>
</p>

  <p>The commotion over the Moon Shield City went practically unnoticed, even with the death of two cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The people didn't stir, possibly because they didn't even know that two cultivators had just been killed.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Evil God was slowly descending into the prison in the north of the city.</p>

  <p>The prison guards barked orders at each other while swarming out to rush towards him.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Evil God, these guards meant absolutely nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Barely even shooting them a glance, countless stalagmites as thick as wrists suddenly popped out from the ground and strung the guards together.</p>

  <p>Then, the prison's walls and fences collapsed with a loud bang, frightening the prisoners inside.</p>

  <p>The prisoners didn't dare to make a move, staring fearfully at the Evil God who was descending from the sky.</p>

  <p>With a smile on her face, Edna slowly walked towards the Evil God as he landed on the prison ground.</p>

  <p>She had been consumed with worry and had hoped that the Evil God wouldn't come in person. However, now that he was here, she couldn't help but be drawn towards him.</p>

  <p>Without uttering a word, she fell into the arms of her husband.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," the Evil God whispered into her ear.</p>

  <p>Wrapping his arms around her waist tightly, he then launched themselves into the sky and flew to the deck of the black ship.</p>

  <p>As soon as she set foot on the deck, she felt a blazing gaze boring into the back of her head.</p>

  <p>Turning around, she saw Shera glaring at her with a hint of jealousy.</p>

  <p>Edna met Shera's gaze calmly. "Nice to meet you."</p>

  <p>Shera was planning to say something first, but was immediately caught off guard by Edna's courteous greeting. At a loss for words, she didn't respond.</p>

  <p>However, seeing Edna leaning on the Evil God intimately, she felt her heart sink.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had come all the way to the Blood Sea Province to save Edna. What more could she say?</p>

  <p>However, Shera was a veteran in battle. Surely she could survive these trivial matters. Forcing a smile, she asked in a strained voice, "Who are you to him? What are you doing in the Blood Sea Province?"</p>

  <p>"She's my wife, and she's also from Luo Zheng's inner world," the Evil God suddenly cut in, answering for her. "Not long ago, Luo Zheng let her go, but she was taken here by the Bearing race."</p>

  <p>"I see," Shera said through gritted teeth. "Since we've saved her already, can we go now?"</p>

  <p>She and the former captain had predicted that the Xuanyuan would take action shortly after they entered the Bearing race's territory. However, he hadn't shown up since, which made Shera feel a bit uneasy.</p>

  <p>Since the Xuanyuan didn't show up, there was no need for the Black Ship to stir up any more trouble. Now, leaving the territory of the Bearing race seemed like the best choice.</p>

  <p>"No." The Evil God shook his head. "The Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer are coming soon. I want to challenge them."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, both Shera and the former captain, who was standing nearby, frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Along the way, the former captain had been reporting the situation of the Evil God to the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>There were too many risks involved in challenging the Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>He had to ask Grandmaster of Heaven for advice.</p>

  <p>To his disdain, however, the Grandmaster of Heaven had no means to stop the Evil God. Instead, he hoped to assess the true strength of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>However, in order to do so, he wanted the Evil God to fight the Xuanyuan alone.</p>

  <p>If the Divine Farmer got involved, the situation would change drastically.</p>

  <p>Edna looked at her husband when he said that. She had heard of the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Back in the Heart Flow Sect, she had asked for information on the masters in the Source World.</p>

  <p>These two were Eternal Realm masters.</p>

  <p>And the way to the Eternal Realm had been sealed, so at this point, it was impossible for the Evil God to reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Even so, she no longer felt anxious. She had learned to trust in her husband.</p>

  <p>"Are you confident you'll win?" the former captain asked. "Shera and I can help you pin down one of them."</p>

  <p>Although there were no other members left, there was still Shera, who was at the top level of the Holy Soul Realm, and the former captain himself, an Eternal Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to do anything. They're already here," the Evil God said, turning suddenly to look at the space on the side of the ship.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure they've heard what I just said."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A unique triangular space appeared, and from within, the figures of the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer floated.</p>

  <p>The triangular space had completely sealed off the auras of the two people. They were so close, yet the former captain and Shera didn't notice them till the Evil God pointed them out.</p>

  <p>"Young people are really something. You haven't even reached the Holy Soul Realm, yet you dare to challenge the two of us," the Xuanyuan said calmly, locking eyes with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up slightly. "I'm a little curious. In just a few days, you seem to have changed into a different person. Is the Blood-controlling Method really so powerful?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of the Blood-controlling Method, the Xuanyuan's expression darkened slightly. "How did you know?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at him knowingly, as though he could see everything the world had to offer. "The Source World can't keep too many secrets from me."</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan's frown deepened.</p>

  <p>This ability was much too terrifying!</p>

  <p>Usman, who they cultivated so painstakingly, turned out to be a stepping-stone for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>However, the more the Xuanyuan thought about it, his heart began to beat faster.</p>

  <p>Usman wasn't strong enough to control the Source World.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the Evil God was infinitely stronger than Usman, at least in terms of merging with the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan began to explore the idea of using the Evil God. If he could somehow find a way to control or devour him, he could benefit greatly.</p>

  <p>"Well, we're not ones to step down from a challenge. Let's fight to the last breath, right here, right now." As the Xuanyuan spoke, he turned his head towards the sky. "Othniel!"</p>

  <p>A huge creature suddenly appeared in the sky above the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>With the huge creature blotting out the sun, a huge shadow fell over the entire province. Confused, the people in the Moon Shield City looked to the sky to see what was going on. Chaos ensued as the people's hearts were struck with fear.</p>

  <p>If a battle this massive were to take place, the whole Blood Sea Province would suffer collateral damage!</p>

  <p>"Othniel is here!"</p>

  <p>Shera and the former captain frowned deeply as they watched the huge creature hovering in the sky.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer were already a handful to begin with. Now, with the Chaos Ancient God Othniel involved, the Black Ship had no chance of winning.</p>

  <p>The first thing the former captain thought of was to ask the Grandmaster of Heaven to come help them.</p>

  <p>"This place is not large enough. Come into my illusion!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Othniel finished speaking, a triangular door appeared in front of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Othniel's invitation was a thinly veiled challenge.</p>

  <p>"You are all famous masters in the chaos. It's ridiculous for you to stoop so low as to face the Evil God together," Shera shouted to them. Then, turning to the Evil God, she pleaded, "Don't fall into their trap, please!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at the triangular door and pressed his hand against it cautiously. Closing his eyes, he tried to feel the space beyond it. Turning to his wife, he said abruptly, "Wait for me." Without further hesitation, he entered the door and disappeared in it.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The very next moment, the triangular door closed and vanished.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan, the Divine Farmer, and Othniel also disappeared quickly.</p>

  <p>The people of the Moon Shield City were all relieved to see that the huge creature was gone. Naturally, they didn't want to suffer from collateral damage.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God has gone in! What should we do now?" Shera cried anxiously.</p>

  <p>Without a word, the former captain sat down cross-legged and began to recite the Truth of Divine Dao. He planned to enter the Other Shore again to communicate with the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Seeing how flustered Shera was, Edna took her hand gently. "Don't worry, my husband will be fine. He will win."</p>

  <p>"You know nothing!"</p>

  <p>Shera yanked her hand away, shooting Edna an indignant glare.</p>

  <p>How could a weak True God know how fierce the battle of top masters was?</p>

  <p>What Shera said stunned Edna, but she decidedly remained calm. "I don't know who is stronger, but I know my husband. Since he asked me to wait for him, he will definitely come back."</p>

  <p>Edna's eyes shone with an almost child-like innocence as she spoke. Shera turned away in disgust, secretly praying in her heart that what Edna was saying was true.</p>
