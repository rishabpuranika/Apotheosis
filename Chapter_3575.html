<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy passed through the forest and walked halfway around the lake before she arrived at the pavilion.</p>

  <p>She pushed the door of the pavilion open, only to find a wholly different space greeting her from within.</p>

  <p>Countless rays of sword light floated in the air, circling around like a big whirlpool. This was the famous Origin Sword Light.</p>

  <p>Among all the disciples in the Origin Mountain, few had the chance to be taught by Yasamin herself. And among these few, Dorothy was the only one who had the right to cultivate the Origin Swordsmanship in this space.</p>

  <p>Dorothy went up to the whirlpool formed by the sword light.</p>

  <p>Yasamin was floating in the center of this whirlpool. She seemed to be adventuring on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The moment Dorothy approached, a ray of sword light flew towards her.</p>

  <p>She stretched out a hand and gently played with the sword light. A long, melodious sound was immediately transmitted into the big whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Yasamin was able to sense this on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If someone else were to play the sword light in an attempt to wake Yasamin, she would have become furious. She would then just ignore the sound and stay on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But every time Dorothy played the sword light, Yasamin retreated from the Other Shore as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Dorothy played the sword light for a while before she sat down, arms around her knees and waiting for her grandmother to wake up. She was also mentally preparing herself to talk to her grandmother, trying to decide what to say to her.</p>

  <p>Her grandmother had figured out her affection towards Zheng a long time ago and wanted to help her fulfill her wish. That was why Yasamin had had the conflict with Flamine in the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>But though Dorothy was passionate, she was extremely reserved when it came to relationships between man and woman. And though Yasamin was anxious for her granddaughter, she could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>At the time, Dorothy had liked traveling with Zheng on the Other Shore. She hadn't thought that Feng Ge would appear suddenly.</p>

  <p>Chaim had reminded her of her love in the Land of Sword Grief. Only then had Dorothy realized that she should strive for her love, just like Feng Ge had.</p>

  <p>But the question of how to speak euphemistically to her grandmother still remained.</p>

  <p>She fought an internal battle for quite a while. When she came to her senses, she found that five minutes had passed, but her grandmother was still floating at the center of the sword light whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was confused. Even though Yasamin was on the Other Shore, she should have known that Dorothy was coming. But five minutes had passed and she still hadn't retreated from the Other Shore. Could she have been trapped somewhere unusual?</p>

  <p>There were some places like the Dark Region and the temples that warriors were not allowed to exit at will.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was discomfited as she remembered the provocative look in Feng Ge's eyes. So she merely waited.</p>

  <p>She waited for about one more hour before she realized that there seemed to be something wrong with her grandmother. Yasamin's body seemed somewhat illusory in the midst of the sword light, but Dorothy could still see her clearly.</p>

  <p>Yasamin's wrinkled face was usually ruddy, but it was now pale as paper.</p>

  <p>"Grandma!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy's cultivation level was not very high, but she knew that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>She played the sword light once again. The sword light buzzed sharply and was transmitted to within the whirlpool. Her grandmother would wake up the moment she heard this sound, she knew it.</p>

  <p>But Yasamin remained motionless. Her face paled with every passing second and every ray of Origin Sword Light in the entire space began to vibrate.</p>

  <p>This sword light could be seen as Yasamin's avatar. It would usually be taken back to her body. But when she cultivated here, she'd release all the Origin Sword Light from her body.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was familiar with the sword light. It trembled and howled, as if sensing that Yasamin was in danger. It sobbed and complained to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Grandma! Grandma!"</p>

  <p>The scene unfolding before Dorothy reminded her that Yasamin was in trouble.</p>

  <p>She took a couple of steps forward before she realized that she couldn't get close to her grandmother. She remembered that every time Yasamin had woken up, she emerged from the whirlpool by herself.</p>

  <p>Dorothy thought for a moment before she turned around and rushed out of the pavilion. Emerging from the forest, she pulled out the message runes and crushed them one by one.</p>

  <p>Before long, beams of light flew up from the halls in the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>They headed straight for the top of the mountain, gathering outside the forest.</p>

  <p>Each of these had a strong aura. Not for nothing were they the backbone of the Origin Mountain. Winchell, one of the few people qualified to enter the forest, led the group.</p>

  <p>At Dorothy's words, he went straight into the forest without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Two other people accompanied him into the forest.</p>

  <p>Dorothy meant to follow them but the moment she took a step forward, she felt her foot become heavy.</p>

  <p>It looked like even a powerful existence like her grandmother, who was at the top level of the Other Shore Realm, couldn't avoid danger.</p>

  <p>She was afraid that once she entered the forest, she would see her grandmother's soulless body before her.</p>

  <p>She trembled with fear at the thought, but someone caught her from behind.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Felicity!" Dorothy cried out.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine," Felicity said, comforting her while looking at the forest. "Madam Yasamin will safely leave the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>It would actually be very difficult for a warrior at such a high level as Yasamin to die on the Other Shore, because the souls of strongest warriors like them had already risen to another level.</p>

  <p>'So, did something unexpected happen on the Other Shore?'</p>

  <p>Felicity had many possibilities mapped out in her mind, but she did not say anything. She merely tried to comfort Dorothy in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>After a long time, Winchell walked out of the forest.</p>

  <p>Dorothy felt her heart plummet at the seriousness on his face. She then heard him say, "I think Madam Yasamin is trapped in a dangerous situation, but she is still fighting hard. I don't know how long she can hold on. I'm going to the Phoenix Palace."</p>

  <p>The seven mountains under the Oneness Sky Palace were closely connected to each other, like siblings. And especially the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain. Now that something terrible was happening to Yasamin, they had to inform Eastern Emperor Taiyi as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>With gloom dangling over them, Felicity, Dorothy, and the other powerful warriors of the Origin Mountain watched Winchell leave.</p>

  <p>In the Flow Sword Sect...</p>

  <p>Margaret had been very satisfied over the past few days. Zheng had been with her all the time, and even Yudie had taken good care of her. The atmosphere in the independent courtyard house had never been so harmonious.</p>

  <p>Yudie had once suggested that Margaret enter Zheng's inner world. If the time flow rate rose, she would be able to give birth to the baby sooner. But Margaret refused because she didn't want her pregnancy to pass quickly.</p>

  <p>"A Fetus Nourishing Pill, worth two million divine crystals, can nourish the innate spirit!"</p>

  <p>"An Earth Longevity Pill, worth five hundred thousand divine crystals, can help you live for a million years even if you don't cultivate or become a True God!"</p>

  <p>"A Talent Upgrading Pill, worth five million divine crystals, can help you improve your cultivation talent greatly!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Trish displayed before Zheng the pills that she had bought.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not help but feel amazed after learning of the effects of these pills. It looked like the starting point in the Source World was much higher than in the divine land. And these pills had little to no side effects when used to nourish the fetus.</p>
