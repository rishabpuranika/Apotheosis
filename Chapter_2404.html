  <p>
</p>

  <p>This time the winter was so cold and intense that the snow engulfed almost half the divine land, with the Time Sea located in the center.</p>

  <p>It was the biggest snow of this divine era.</p>

  <p>The entire Swirl Forest was covered with thick, soft snow. The huge trees, towering at a thousand feet high, also looked majestic as they were cloaked in white.</p>

  <p>All the women, including Yudie, Xun and Aura, stood at the entrance gate of the Immortal Mansion. They had assembled to say their farewells to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>There were too many things that Yudie wanted to say, but all of a sudden she became speechless. She just kept looking at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was well aware that Luo Zheng had many priorities and obligations to fulfill. Hence, she was treasuring every second she spent with him.</p>

  <p>Despite her dread over their separation day, she knew she must be strong in order to motivate Luo Zheng to fulfill what he was destined for.</p>

  <p>"This time, I won't be gone for long." Luo Zheng smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>Yudie nodded sadly while saying, "This time, Aura and I will enter the training tower together."</p>

  <p>Previously, with their existing talents and skills, they had very limited chances of becoming proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Once in the tower, it was difficult to gauge the time that passed by. It was way too arduous to pass the seemingly long years within the tower, before they reunited with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now with Joy's help, if they practiced rigorously at the training tower, they would still have a good chance of becoming proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Their next step was to exchange their blood and avoid the punishment of the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>"It's time to go," said Joy who stood at a distance.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We should leave now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded with a trace of sadness in his eyes. Abruptly he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>He was fully prepared for the debate over the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>From time to time, he would take out Luo Nian from the gourd when he required his help to decipher those golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Nian kind of flinched when his father asked for his help, he patiently deciphered many contents.</p>

  <p>Once, when Luo Nian was in a candid mood, he actually told Luo Zheng that he had fallen in love with someone, who was said to be a princess of a divine kingdom within the gourd.</p>

  <p>The world inside the gourd was considered as the secondary world, along with the secondary creatures that lived in it.</p>

  <p>Under the protection of the enchanted barrier at the Immortal Mansion, Luo Nian could even bring the creatures from the gourd into the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really care about what Luo Nian did within the gourd.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was a responsible grown-up, so he had the right to take control of his own business.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie objected strongly to Luo Nian's doings, and once she had even sealed off the gourd to stop Luo Nian from re-entering it.</p>

  <p>But under her boy's insistence, she had no choice but to give the gourd back to him.</p>

  <p>These days, Luo Nian had been in the gourd to enjoy himself.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Joy walked towards the light curtain, they heard a voice from behind.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian appeared at the gate of the Immortal Mansion with a smile, holding the gourd in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You brat! Come here."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and patted him on the head.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian lowered his head, chuckled, and said, "The divine textures I've deciphered for you are amazing. Please don't disappoint me!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the tired expression on his face, Luo Zheng shook his head. The little guy had been living in a favorable environment since he was a child, and hence his upbringing and temperament were way different than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>After saying goodbye to Luo Nian, Luo Zheng held the wind token and passed through the enchanted barrier of the Immortal Mansion along with Joy.</p>

  <p>Then Joy put a hand on Luo Zheng's shoulder and said in a commanding voice,</p>

  <p>"Transfer!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that everything around him crumbled and disappeared.</p>

  <p>When performing the spatial transference, the Holy Beings could move a hundred times farther than the consummate True Gods, but they still found it difficult to travel across more than half of the divine land in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Joy and Luo Zheng headed towards the west as their bodies kept flashing.</p>

  <p>As they traveled westward, the depth of the snow grew deeper and deeper.</p>

  <p>If this was the situation in the world of the mortals, not many would have survived this climate.</p>

  <p>However, in the divine land, even the low grass and trees were not afraid of this biting cold at all.</p>

  <p>Soon, three days had already passed. dozens of low-rank True Gods were moving forward across the vast snowfield.</p>

  <p>These True Gods had traveled from far off places. They had crossed mountains and rivers, as well as countless cities. They even spent hundreds of divine might coins. In fact, they actually spent almost everything they had.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods would start their journey a few years ahead of time in order to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao after they had gotten a fair amount of understanding of the golden Sanskrit words or even a few words of the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Anyway, time was hardly of any essence for a True God. A journey ahead of time would save a lot of money for the use of the transmission arrays between the divine cities.</p>

  <p>"We are finally here. Ahead of us is the Non-combat Zone," said a topless True God, peering into the distance. The moment the snowflakes made contact with his body, they would immediately transform into water and even start boiling.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I don't know why, but I feel that this debate over the Divine Dao won't be like before. There is going to be a lot of intensity this time," a strong man, who was leading the pack, mumbled, as he stared ahead.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Non-combat Zone, there was a clear boundary, that ran across. Once they crossed the threshold, they would step into the area of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean it would be different?" one of the True Gods asked him with curiosity.</p>

  <p>The so-called leader continued to look at the snow not far away and said,</p>

  <p>"The Sword Clan holds the debate over the Divine Dao with the hope that all of the True Gods and Holy Beings will be able to make a greater breakthrough on the Divine Dao. However, in the past, the Sword Clan took a very casual attitude in the matter. But this time, they seemed to be more involved and active. They have released a variety of pretty rare treasures, and even a Truth of Divine Dao of two hundred words."</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a bit strange," another True God echoed.</p>

  <p>While the True Gods were still engaged in their discussion, suddenly two figures emerged out of the snow line in front of them.</p>

  <p>They were easily floating around without any external help.</p>

  <p>"Top-rank True Gods!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods below trembled slightly as they sighted the two figures.</p>

  <p>Somehow, they felt a little anxious, even though the Non-combat Zone was right ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two figures, one who was clad in black and the other in white, came towards them instantly.</p>

  <p>The black cloaked figure looked down at them and laughed. "Welcome to the Non-combat Zone, everyone! You must have traveled thousands of miles!"</p>

  <p id="top_4">The strongest warrior who was leading the group, was a mid-rank True God. The rest of the warriors were all low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the two people above him, and asked, "May I ask if I am addressing the members of the Sword Clan?"</p>

  <p>"Members of the Sword Clan?" The man in black grinned, "Well yes.</p>

  <p>You can say that."</p>

  <p>"My name is Darrel Xiao. We are extremely honored to meet the people of the Sword Clan," the strong man said politely. "We have been traveling since two years ago, to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao held by the Sword Clan."</p>

  <p>"The debate over the Divine Dao is set up for the entire world, and everyone is more than welcome to participate in it. But if you want to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao this year, you will have to pay for the entry," the man in black said bluntly. "Hand over all the divine might coins and all the golden Sanskrit words, that are in your possession. Only then will the path to the Non-combat Zone be opened for you."</p>

  <p>Darrel Xiao and those low-rank True Gods had been feeling bad for a long time. Everyone could enter the Non-combat Zone. The sudden appearance of these two top-rank True Gods was already strange. Their feelings were right.</p>

  <p>"As the top-rank True Gods, you two are the best in the divine land. To rob us, it's very demeaning at your end," Darrel Xiao said bitterly, with a heavy heart.</p>

  <p>All they wanted to do was to take part in the debate over the Divine Dao and gain some insights. They had spent time and money just to arrive here. It was a very unfortunate situation that they should encounter such heartless souls.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste time engaging in a conversation with them. Just finish them!" said the man in white impatiently.</p>

  <p>The man in black shrugged his shoulders and said to Darrel Xiao, "Did you hear that? My younger brother doesn't have much patience. If you speak one more word, we won't be left with much option."</p>

  <p>Everyone was dismayed hearing these words. Looking at their destination not far away, they sighed helplessly in their hearts. The Non-combat Zone was only a few dozen miles away. Even the Holy Beings couldn't do anything to them once they entered. It was really an undeserved catastrophe for them to be blocked by these two men.</p>

  <p>Realizing that they couldn't escape this, these True Gods sighed and took out their divine might coins, to hand over.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, not far away two more figures appeared in the snowfield.</p>

  <p>Each of them wore a cloak.</p>

  <p>They were Luo Zheng and Joy.</p>

  <p>The spatial transference was not allowed in the Non-combat Zone, so Joy planned to leave after Luo Zheng entered it.</p>

  <p>Hence, before she reached the zone, she would try everything to hide her own cultivation base to avoid unnecessary attention.</p>
