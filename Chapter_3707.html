  <p>
</p>

  <p>After he finally understood the entire story, the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't order Ziya any further.</p>

  <p>What occurred in the Deleting Space was beyond what he'd imagined.</p>

  <p>He needed time to absorb what he'd seen, and at the same time, had to hand over the exploration of the Abstruse Energy World to Ziya and Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>After all, energy souls couldn't give much help.</p>

  <p>As for the Heart of Limit, Luo Zheng tried to carry it.</p>

  <p>Since the Heart of Limit was taken to the Deleting Space from the Abstruse Energy World, he tried to use the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to carry it but failed.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard they analyzed, neither Luo Zheng nor Ziya could seem to understand the reason it didn't work.</p>

  <p>But because Luo Zheng was the first person to carry the Other Shore Token in the Deleting Space, the problem could be in the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, Deleting Space, or the Heart of Limit itself. Still, they couldn't pinpoint the right one.</p>

  <p>Ziya looked very disappointed. He wanted so bad to see the Deleting Space as another Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng wasn't bothered by it.</p>

  <p>With his current abilities, he still could not bring the three Civilization Artifacts to their limits. Even if he truly carried the Heart of Limit, there would be no guarantee that it would help him.</p>

  <p>At this point, his top priority was to achieve a higher level on the Other Shore. Nothing else mattered except this.</p>

  <p>A few days later, Luo Zheng left the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>And since Luo Zheng left, so did the energy souls. Meanwhile, the bodies Ziya had created for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others remained like statues in the palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, on the other hand, remained in the Deleting Space. He was not alone - he had the holy maiden of the Flower Dancing Sect as company.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's promise to Luo Nian was finally fulfilled now.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng was still uneasy with this action. He mentioned to Yudie that Luo Nian had been chosen by a human master and accepted as a disciple.</p>

  <p>This meant that he was to be secluded and isolated for a long stretch of time.</p>

  <p>If Yudie found out that Luo Zheng lied to her, would she still treat him as intimately as usual?</p>

  <p>Weeks went by and the Taiyi Heaven Palace was gradually restored to its original state.</p>

  <p>The once damaged Dragon City had been rebuilt, while the Phoenix Palace had been moved elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Because the Bearing race broke through the Dragon Cliff, the southeast of the Bloom Divine Province grew restless. It was for this reason that Goran replaced the dead Patton in order to guard the cliff and protect the province.</p>

  <p>All the creatures in the Bloom Divine Province were jittery and anxious. It came to a point that a handful of powerful masters even chose to move their families all the way to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>This was a smart move. No matter what had happened, the Li Shan mountain proved to be much stronger than the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Whoever wanted to attack the Li Shan mountain, might it be the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race, would have to think hard before taking a move.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace did not stop anyone from moving if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>In essence, a good bird perches only on a fine tree. In the same suit, humans of Bloom Divine Province could move if they found it more suitable. Even Pearce and Auden wanted to move all the senior leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace to the Li Shan mountain, just so they could avoid any more disasters.</p>

  <p>As long as Ying and Eastern Emperor Taiyi woke up, they could return to the Bloom Divine Province safe and sound.</p>

  <p>This was the most rational choice. But if all the masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace fled from the Bloom Divine Province, it would only lead to the collapse of the palace. Hence, they didn't dare to make such a decision for Eastern Emperor Taiyi as he had spent a long time building the palace.</p>

  <p>After a hasty, passionate discussion, Pearce, Auden, Qiu Yinhe, and Winchell chose to stay in the Bloom Divine Province. Once they came to an agreement, Pearce replaced Eastern Emperor Taiyi and issued an imperial edict to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Through the edict, the war between the humans and the Jin Wu was made public. Also written in the edit, he informed that the Li Shan mountain would provide assistance if necessary, to calm down the panic in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng didn't care too much regarding these matters. Even though he had been in the Taiyi Heaven Palace for a long time, it was not meant for him forever.</p>

  <p>After knowing Feng Ge had burned the Truth Enlightenment when she thought she was doomed, he wrote down another one for her.</p>

  <p>After Pearce obtained the Truth Enlightenment, he was very surprised.</p>

  <p>There was no point in hiding it anymore now. All he wanted to do was to help the palace with it.</p>

  <p>However, if everyone in the Taiyi Heaven Palace knew the Truth Enlightenment, it wouldn't be long until everyone started using it for their own personal interests. Many people from the Bearing race, Divine Farmer race, and other super forces could also learn it, especially because they also cultivated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>It was for this reason that Pearce made a rule. Every person who read the Truth Enlightenment could only share it with one person they trusted. Also, they needed to swear an oath so that the Truth Enlightenment could not be leaked.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, the figures of Luo Zheng and Feng Ge reappeared.</p>

  <p>They had cleared their goals just after the fierce battle with the Jin Wu had finished.</p>

  <p>In order to enter Stage Thirty-three, they would have to enter the Soul City and go through the Land of Bone Tribulation first. With their Indigo Souls at the ultimate level, it would be no problem for them to enter Stage Twenty-nine to get to Soul City.</p>

  <p>There happened to be temples in Stage Seventeen, but none that interested them.</p>

  <p>Once they'd passed through the white star ring, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge transformed into two rays of white light and made their way upwards.</p>

  <p>Then, they arrived at Stage Eighteen which was a translucent ice field.</p>

  <p>Here, ancient secrets were sealed within the thick ice. Historically, many ruling civilizations had made this stage their habitat. However, they ended up disappearing into history - some were eliminated, and some were forced to hide.</p>

  <p>The two walked a long distance along the ice field before they came into contact with the star ring leading to Stage Nineteen. Here, they stepped onto the star ring and were sent up into the air once again.</p>

  <p>Once they arrived in Stage Nineteen, they stepped out of the star ring and a whistling wind swept through them.</p>

  <p>In Stage Nineteen, the hurricanes never ceased. As they scanned the area, they could only see boundless yellow sand.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the star ring leading to Stage Twenty was not too far away.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge led the way, and they found the star ring in less than five minutes.</p>

  <p>Near the star ring, some human Souls of Light sized up them. Their origins were unknown, but they seemed to be powerful. Not long after though, the Souls of Light retreated from the Other Shore after whispering among each other.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng and Feng Ge were about to step into the star ring and enter Stage Twenty, Luo Zheng paused.</p>

  <p>He recalled that not long after he entered the Source World, he obtained an Other Shore Key from the tomb of the Sword Light Palace's leader. That Other Shore Key could open up a temple in Stage Nineteen.</p>

  <p>But now, such a temple was no longer attractive to Luo Zheng. He wanted to give that Other Shore Token to Chaim and his companions for exploration.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he continued and stepped into the star ring alongside Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>They passed Stage Twenty, Stage Twenty-one, and Stage Twenty-two...</p>

  <p>And as they passed each stage, they saw every scene change drastically.</p>

  <p>If it were any other person, they would have stopped in each stage just to explore.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge had one goal only. They moved up stages quickly, each and every time they found the star ring.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long until they arrived in Stage Twenty-eight, the Eternal Prohibition Stage. The upper stage of it was the Constant Glory Stage, where the Soul City was located. Their journey was about to finish!</p>

  <p>However, they met some challenges in no time.</p>
