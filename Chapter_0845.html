<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"There are so many of them!"</p>

  <p>Just like flashes of light, Luo Zheng's figure constantly shuttled high and low through the space as he quickly dodged the aggressive space cracks hurtling towards him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng began to feel the pressure due to the fact that with the constant increase of space cracks, the space Luo Luo Zheng initially used to evade the vicious attacks became more and more limited.</p>

  <p>This space where Luo Luo Zheng was situated in was not large enough to begin with, so there had been an inadequate space for Luo Luo Zheng to move freely. With the continuous multiplication of the space cracks, he realized that he would be engulfed by them sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remembered that when he had faced the giant swords summoned by Marilyn from the Purple Power World in the past, he had also utilized the Space Law to avoid the onslaught of attacks. Even though she had summoned over a hundred giant swords that glinted wickedly, Luo Luo Zheng was always able to find a foothold to stand. Right now, the situation was vastly different given the fact that it was more and more difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to find a place to stand. With a start, he furrowed his eyebrows in concentration--if he would not be able to avoid those space cracks, he would soon fail and be kicked out of this test.</p>

  <p>'Space cracks, huh?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and deeply pondered, trying to find an immediate solution.</p>

  <p>Albeit his study of the second layer of the Space Law was brief, Luo Luo Zheng acquired a general idea of the space.</p>

  <p>The first layer was ultimately for individuals to be able to travel through space. In fact, the logic behind this was to condense two spaces together.</p>

  <p>Through the perspective of an outsider looking at his movements, Luo Luo Zheng could appear to travel a certain distance in an instant, when in reality, Luo Luo Zheng had only taken a single step. How he had achieved this was by bonding two consecutive "nodes" using the Space Law.</p>

  <p>In other words, Luo Luo Zheng had bent the space around him and cleverly taken a shortcut.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the space cracks on the second layer operated on different terms.</p>

  <p>Some tremendously powerful masters could tear the space apart through brute force. Because of this fact, this meant that space actually could hold the strength of an attack to a certain degree. Therefore, the smaller the space, the more fragile it was, and more importantly, the easier it was for people to tear it apart.</p>

  <p>A good example of this would be the space on the Cloud Road, as it was particularly unstable. Even though no one had ever torn it apart, some Space Cracks and its weak parts naturally appeared in the space due to its unstable property. At that time, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to use those weak parts in the space to move.</p>

  <p>In the real world, space was exceptionally indestructible. Someone who was a Virtual Tribulation Realm master would even be unable to tear up the space, and the best they could do was to resort to a secret method to weaken it. For instance, Saint Morphens was one of those who could use such a complex technique. The man was at the medium stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm and was skilled enough to disrupt the space. As a result of this, some parts in the space were significantly weakened. By taking advantage of the weak parts, he could subsequently use his Mystical Pace to move around in the area.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Saint Morphens ultimately was not capable of tearing space apart.</p>

  <p>To be able to tear the space of this world open was probably an impossible task to accomplish, even for the terribly powerful master Eddie, unless one managed to completely comprehend the second layer of the Space Law!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was just given a few more days, he would probably be able to comprehend it with certainty. The situation was dismal--the time that Luo Luo Zheng used just now to comprehend the Space Law was astonishingly short as the chance of mastering the second layer just slipped through his finger in a moment.</p>

  <p>At the present, Luo Luo Zheng could only rely on himself to overcome the problem and comprehend it alone.</p>

  <p>In the midst of constantly dodging the space cracks, he also urged himself to find any sort of clue or form any theory to solve this hitch. 'The space here is fractured and has formed many space cracks, ' he thought to himself as he observed his surroundings while evading. 'But why would they attack me in the first place?'</p>

  <p>The realization suddenly dawned on him that everyone was simply like a fish swimming in space. If there was any kind of blockage or impediment that occurred in the water, the common fish would naturally swim in a certain direction! It was akin to a light bulb turning on in his mind because from this particular point of view, the space and water were similar in some ways.</p>

  <p>"The fish in the water?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the theory formed in his head, Luo Luo Zheng rapidly activated his life vitality. With a determined expression on his face, he began to utilize the second layer of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had not fully comprehended the second layer of the Space Law, what he had just realized moments ago was enough for him at that instant!</p>

  <p>In any case, Luo Luo Zheng did not plan to tear space apart in the first place nor did he expect that he could have a perfect command of the second layer of the Space Law in such a short time. What he sought to do was to transform himself into a little fish which persisted in swimming--not a fish aimlessly moving in the water, but a fish resolutely advancing in the space.</p>

  <p>"Let me give it a try!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng uttered to himself while he gritted his teeth and balled his fists tightly at his sides. For this very moment, he did not attempt to travel through space. Instead, he exhaled a quick breath and stood still.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng halted his movements, the space cracks that were similar to the abominable mouths of monsters quickly approached, aiming to engulf him from all directions. Upon perceiving the incoming brutish attack of the space cracks, Luo Luo Zheng firmly closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>If there were anyone else in the area and noticed the still form of the boy, they would have undoubtedly believed that Luo Luo Zheng had given up the fight, not knowing he had a plan in his head.</p>

  <p>"In the second layer, the first point of tearing space is to integrate oneself into space itself. In fact, this key point has already been touched upon in the first layer of the Space Law, but it barely skims the surface and it doesn't discuss the actual definition in detail," he started to explain to himself in the darkness, profoundly resolute at the logic of what he was about to do. "I will try to combine the first layer of the Space Law with what I realized just now. I know I can do it!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed. It was a do-or-die situation and he was certain of his presumption; he had no time to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Within a second, the first space crack steadily zoomed towards Luo Zheng's immobile form, aiming at his head about to devour him!</p>
