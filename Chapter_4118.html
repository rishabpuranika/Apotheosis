<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A black ship slowly approached the Evil God.</p>

  <p>On the side of the ship sat Shera, who had yet to recover from her shock.</p>

  <p>The former captain of the ship sat beside her in silence, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>He had only helped the Evil God devour Usman because the Grandmaster of Heaven asked him to.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God himself was like a Pandora's box, full of uncertainty. No one knew how he would affect the future and what he would bring to it.</p>

  <p>"Is this the power of the Source World?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>"My power," the Evil God answered with a pout.</p>

  <p>He had already considered himself the ruler of the entire world.</p>

  <p>"Your power is truly something else… It's on a par with that of the Chaos Ancient Gods," Shera continued.</p>

  <p>All the Eternal Realm warriors in this world could destroy a province, but it was a time-consuming task.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Evil God only moved for a bit, but he had wiped out the entire Roaring Lake Province in just an hour. Only the Chaos Ancient Gods could achieve such a feat!</p>

  <p>"The Chaos Ancient Gods?" There was a trace of contempt in the Evil God's voice.</p>

  <p>Indeed, those Chaos Ancient Gods might have grasped the highest level of truths.</p>

  <p>However, there were some truths that might not work in his territory!</p>

  <p>The more compatible he was with the Source World, the stronger the power he would have.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he suddenly thought of something that deeply bothered him. It was an issue that was close to his heart.</p>

  <p>The image of a person filled his mind, and he immediately closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then, his spiritual sense flowed out like water and began to wash over the entire Roaring Lake Province.</p>

  <p>When Shera felt his spiritual sense, she asked curiously, "Who are you looking for?"</p>

  <p>"A person," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"A person? Who?" Shera asked again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, either." The Evil God closed his eyes and shook his head.</p>

  <p>After he had fused with the Source World, he became immensely sensitive to everything within it.</p>

  <p>That was why the Source World had sensed a concern in his heart and gave feedback to him.</p>

  <p>The problem was that he could not possibly care about anyone in the Source World. The feeling was quite strange and out of character for him.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, his spiritual sense appeared in the center of every large province in the Source World and quickly spread everywhere, until it covered all of the great provinces.</p>

  <p>It was probably the broadest spread of spiritual sense in history!</p>

  <p>Once all the spiritual sense had spread out, the Evil God saw everything in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Eventually, he caught sight of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Edna!"</p>

  <p>However, his lips curved into a slight frown.</p>

  <p>The concern he felt was for his wife.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he did not expect that Zheng had released her.</p>

  <p>Did Zheng let her leave his inner world on purpose and leave her to perish by herself?</p>

  <p>No...</p>

  <p>He was not a narrow-minded man.</p>

  <p>Edna must have asked to leave his inner world and gotten his permission.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the Evil God quickly concluded that it was the case.</p>

  <p>Although he had always regarded Zheng as an opponent whom he had to defeat, deep in his heart, he admired Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he knew that the Evil God was a troublemaker, but he still set him free. Such an opponent deserved the Evil God's admiration.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Edna was now in bad condition.</p>

  <p>However, she was very happy when Zheng had released her.</p>

  <p>She wanted to find the Evil God, so she naturally did not stay in the Divine Bloom Province. Instead, she headed west and passed through two large provinces in a row.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace still controlled those two provinces, so they were relatively safe.</p>

  <p>Yet, it was not long after when the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race came and attacked the Oneness Sky Palace. They passed through exactly where Edna went. Since she had already reached the consummation of True God Realm, of course, they did not treat her as an ordinary civilian and captured her.</p>

  <p>Now, she was in the Moon Shield City in the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>The Moon Shield City was a military stronghold of the Bearing race. A large number of warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace remained imprisoned in the city.</p>

  <p>As soon as Edna arrived, the guards threw her and the other prisoners from the Oneness Sky Palace into a smelly dungeon.</p>

  <p>She leaned against the dirty wall with her arms around her legs, her eyes full of sadness.</p>

  <p>Back in Zheng's inner world, she had been born as a beauty. After she married the Evil God, she was like the queen in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Even when Zheng had defeated her husband, she had never suffered any hardships.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, her situation now was far beyond what she could bear.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a series of miserable screams came from the depths of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>The prisoners' hairs stood on their ends upon hearing the piercing cry.</p>

  <p>There was a horrible rumor that spread among them.</p>

  <p>It was said that the warden of this prison was a ruthless warrior in the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. He had a mysterious type of Other Shore Token, which needed to absorb life energy to unleash its power.</p>

  <p>The more potent the source of the life energy was, the better.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World was small, compared to that of the warriors at True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the warden's most favored targets were naturally the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>During that period, they had taken away more and more prisoners at the consummation of the True God Realm, and miserable cries always followed after.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how tragic those prisoners' lives had ended.</p>

  <p>Fear was written all over Edna's face. After all, she did not want to die!</p>

  <p>At first, she felt relieved when she finally left Zheng's inner world— but before she could find her husband, she was going to die.</p>

  <p>It was devastating.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were interrupted when the prison doors opened, and a prison guard of the Bearing race came in.</p>

  <p>He looked around indifferently and pointed at a person in the corner, then shouted, "You, you and you, get up!"</p>

  <p>The three people he pointed to quickly blanched. It meant that their lives were about to come to an end.</p>

  <p>"Don't kill me, please! I'm a member of the Bai Clan at the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>I've never joined the Oneness Sky Palace! I can join the Bearing race, I'll ask my clan... "</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Before the man could even finish his words, the prison guard already stabbed him with a long spear, then threw him out of the prison just like a dead dog.</p>

  <p>These people could not resist at all because their inner worlds had been sealed. But even if their inner worlds were not sealed, they were no match for the prison guard.</p>

  <p>The prison guard had planned to take three people away, but because he just killed one of them, he had to find a substitute.</p>

  <p>"You! Come together with them!"</p>

  <p>This time, the prison guard pointed at Edna.</p>

  <p>Chills ran down her spine, and her body trembled with fear.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a little bit of pride inside her compelled her to go on.</p>

  <p>She stood up and followed the other two people out without any resistance.</p>

  <p>'Will I really die and no longer see my husband forever?' she sighed in her heart.</p>

  <p>Her eyes looked up to the sky.</p>

  <p>However, there was no sky, only dungeon walls covered with spider webs.</p>

  <p>As she walked along the long corridor, her legs felt like lead.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the corridor, the prison guard coldly said,</p>

  <p>"You two go into the penalty room first!"</p>

  <p>The other two prisoners had no choice but to go inside in despair.</p>

  <p>Then, the prison guard's wicked eyes fell on Edna.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the citizens in the Source World to change their appearances, so most of them looked good.</p>

  <p>However, Edna's beauty had an indescribable aura to it, which made the prison guard feel a certain kind of impulse.</p>

  <p>Of course, she felt the prison guard's unwavering gaze. "What do you want to do?" she asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you are going to die. Why not have some fun in your last moment?" the prison guard said with a sinister laugh.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Edna felt utterly flustered when she realized what the prison guard meant.</p>

  <p>Then, the prison guard advanced towards her. Despite her struggles, he grabbed her hair and took her into another empty room.</p>

  <p>Just then, a strong spiritual sense spread out in the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>The spiritual sense even reached the whole dungeon under the ground.</p>

  <p>As a great warrior at the Other Shore Realm, the prison guard also felt the strong spiritual sense right away. He looked up strangely and muttered,</p>

  <p>"Who dares to be so bold and release spiritual sense recklessly in the Moon Shield City?"</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, the spiritual sense had already covered the entire Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>Edna looked up blankly, then her jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>She felt that this powerful spiritual sense was somewhat familiar. Then, she quickly realized that it came from the Evil God!</p>

  <p>"Dar... darling...</p>

  <p>Are you here to save me?" she croaked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she changed her mind and shouted, "Don't come here! This is the Bearing race's territory! They will kill you!"</p>

  <p>Even at her final moments, she still cared about the safety of the Evil God first. She did not want him to risk his life to save her.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, who was far away in the Roaring Lake Province, naturally saw this scene and also heard Edna's cries.</p>

  <p>At that point, vicious killing intent surged from his body.</p>

  <p>His killing intent was also the strongest that was ever released in history, as it covered every corner of the Source World.</p>

  <p>After all, it was hatred that came from the Source World.</p>
