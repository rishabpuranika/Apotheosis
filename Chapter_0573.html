<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples inside the trial, including Frank, did not know what had happened, of course.</p>

  <p>Eight disciples moved forward under Frank's leadership. Meanwhile, Patrick told Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Lewis what had happened before they had arrived.</p>

  <p>The Death Road was full of whirlpools. Each vortex was an isolated space with a different path. Sometimes the disciples would encounter two or even three whirlpools at the same time. The layout of Death Road was so complex that it was a maze.</p>

  <p>After accidentally trespassing into the home of the Flying Yakshas, the disciples had found themselves being chased by three Yakshas. Since two were small, Frank had been able to kill them. The big Yaksha, however, had been too strong. The disciples had known that a fight between them and the strong Yaksha would have attracted other evil animals. So, they ran away as they intended to lure the Yaksha into a safer place, where Frank eventually killed it.</p>

  <p>"That disciple from Cloud Hall cautioned us that the Yaksha was not the strongest beast on Death Road. If it's true, we will soon encounter more trouble." Patrick shook his head. Death Road was far more challenging than they had expected.</p>

  <p>The problem was that despite passing through several whirlpools, one by one, it seemed like an endless cycle. They would eventually trespass into another powerful beast's home. If that happened, all of them might end up in a more miserable situation.</p>

  <p>"Who is that disciple from Cloud Hall? Why is he so familiar with Death Road?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Patrick shook his head. "I don't know. Frank has questioned him several times, but he refuses to reply."</p>

  <p>As they spoke, Luo Zheng studied the disciple from Cloud Hall. He was not tall and looked like an ordinary person. Somehow, Luo Zheng felt as though there was something strange about him. But he could not tell what it was.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the disciple noticed Zheng's gaze and turned to look at him.</p>

  <p>His eyes were deep and calm.</p>

  <p>"How sensitive is he?" Zheng's heart tightened. The space in which they were walking was dimly lit, and Luo Zheng had only glimpsed at the disciple causally. Yet, the disciple still felt Zheng's glare. His sensing ability was stronger than Zheng's, even though Luo Zheng had a strong soul.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, Lois spoke, "There is another transmission door. It's different from the previous one!"</p>

  <p>"We really don't know what is behind it," Zade, a disciple from the Brumous Sect said fearfully.</p>

  <p>When chased by the Flying Yaksha, Zade had been close to death several times. Luckily, Frank and Patrick had rescued him. Death Road was too dangerous for him!</p>

  <p>Despite the problems faced, Zade had gained something precious. The reason why the Yaksha had chased them was that he had found a rare herb called the Gelid Herb. It had considerable value in the Central Region! One piece of Gelid Herb could be sold for five supreme life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>In the Eastern Region, that figure would amount to five million cubic crystals. Zade was indeed, lucky to have found the herb.</p>

  <p>When Zade was picking the Gelid Herb, the Yaksha discovered them. He was lucky enough to survive the Yaksha's attacks. Moreover, other people, including Frank, didn't know that he had successfully collected the Gelid Herb. This was also advantageous for Zade as it meant that Frank was guarding him for free. Zade was undoubtedly proud of his discovery.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. We have no other choice," Frank said as he walked into the whirlpool first.</p>

  <p>With a sigh, the other disciples also entered the whirlpool after Frank.</p>

  <p>"It is so cold here!"</p>

  <p>After they exited the whirlpool, a cold air enveloped the disciples.</p>

  <p>"Whir!"</p>

  <p>The broken spaces were not very large, so it was hardly windy. But this place seemed to be different.</p>

  <p>After Lewis exited the whirlpool, he shivered and suggested, "Let's go to another way. This place is very frightening!"</p>

  <p>"No one is stopping you from leaving," Frank replied.</p>

  <p>Lewis was stunned. Of course, he would not dare to leave alone. If he did venture out by himself, there would be a slim chance of survival.</p>

  <p>"There's probably something evil here which is why it is so cold, and the wind is so strong," Patrick said with a serious expression.</p>

  <p>"We have no other choice but to go forward, regardless of whether good luck or back luck awaits us. Let's go!" Frank said, and began walking forward.</p>

  <p>Considering Frank's calm demeanor and his ability to gather the others, he appeared to have leadership traits. However, deep inside, he also felt alarmed by the situation. But Frank knew that if he showed fear, it would affect how the other disciples perceived him. They might no longer have confidence in him or allow him to lead them unchallenged.</p>

  <p>Zade cautiously glanced around him as he followed the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he noticed something unusual.</p>

  <p>A black plant, not far from his position, seemed to waver in the wind.</p>

  <p>The plant emitted a dark light. As it was black and in a corner, most of the disciples hadn't noticed it.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zade discovered the Gelid Herb, he began paying greater attention to the plants around. Soon, he found another rare herb.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what it was, everything on Death Road was precious. This plant had unique features that Zade had not heard of before. And so, he thought the plant might also fetch him a good price in the market.</p>

  <p>Zade approached the plant without being noticed by the others. He was thrilled with his good luck. Despite being strong and killing a challenging creature by himself, Frank had only got a demon core of the Flying Yaksha whereas Zade had obtained two rare herbs. What was even better was that none of the other disciples knew of his luck! If they passed Death Road successfully, he would be the biggest winner!</p>

  <p>Just as Zade's hand touched the rare herb, something unexpected happened!</p>
