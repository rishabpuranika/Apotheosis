<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>These Holy Beings had incredible awareness.</p>

  <p>If Clark, the Holy Emperor of Tang Clan, had detected something, then Zheng might have gotten in trouble.</p>

  <p>After Clark arrived, the Holy Emperors of other powerful clans on the Floating Islands, including Fang Clan, Qin Clan and Li Clan, all showed up one after another.</p>

  <p>Of course, Samuel, the Holy Emperor of Han Clan came as well.</p>

  <p>Other than the top three clans, the other powerful clans, like the Leng Clan, only had one Holy Emperor each.</p>

  <p>But the top three clans were different from the rest.</p>

  <p>For example, the Moon Clan had three major forces— the Moon Sect, the War God Hall and the Mysterious Soul Building. Each of them had a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had four elderly men wearing black clothes, indicating that they were four Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>'The second and the third ranked clans have three or four Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Their strength is far beyond that of an ordinary clan. I wonder how many Holy Beings there are in the Dongfang Clan, ' Zheng wondered and looked up.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the sky turned dark, as if there was no light in the world. No one was able to see anything.</p>

  <p>This lasted for a very short period of time though. When everyone regained their vision, they saw a person appear in the sky.</p>

  <p>He was wearing a long black robe and had long hair. He looked quite elegant and handsome, as if men's fortitude and women's tenderness had been integrated into him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Holy Nicholas," said the consummate True God of Sun Blind race, his hands cupped.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could enquire, Kelsey explained in advance, "Nicholas Dongfang, the Holy Emperor of Dongfang Clan. He is the No. 1 warrior in the Hall of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Nicholas and gave Kelsey a nod.</p>

  <p>Aleyna couldn't take it anymore. She telepathically told Zheng, "After I came back to the Floating Island with my sister, we found something disturbing. It was after your father was defeated by Nicholas that Murphy took the opportunity to attack him."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face didn't bear any expression when he heard that. He just gave her a nod and stared at Nicholas as if trying to imprint him in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had already guessed that Nicholas had something to do with this.</p>

  <p>With the combined power of Mike, Bromley and Holy Jay, the Mu Clan wouldn't be able to deal with them alone. No one in the divine land had the ability to destroy the Luo Clan except for the Moon Clan, the Sword Clan and the Dongfang Clan. Since Nicholas was in league with Murphy, he must have dealt with Mike in the past.</p>

  <p>As the last Holy Being showed up, more than ten people arrived. They were the Demi-holy Beings of different clans.</p>

  <p>Each powerful clan had a Holy Being, but not every clan had a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>After all, a Demi-holy Being also had the opportunity to become a Holy Being, and they were of great importance to any big clan. Out of the thirty-six powerful clans, about half of them had their own Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>These Demi-holy Beings quickly took their seats. Their seats were a level lower than those of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Joy was present among the group of Demi-holy Beings. She looked down and saw Zheng standing in the crowd. She gave him a warm smile and thought, 'This guy is not afraid of death.'</p>

  <p>Now that all the Holy Beings and Demi-Holy Beings took their seats, the consummate True God of Sun Blind race asked with his eyes shut, "Why haven't I seen Holy Murphy yet?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, Clark, the Holy Being of Tang Clan laughed and said, "He attacked Mike's universe and was punished by the Ruling Slate. Therefore, he is still in the 'prison'."</p>

  <p>"Murphy is too impulsive," the Holy Being of the Qin Clan said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he really wants to get rid of Mike as he can't forget what happened that year," another Holy Being added.</p>

  <p>Zheng also noticed that the Holy Beings that spoke were the members of the powerful clans that were being targeted by Harold. Therefore, they were Zheng's foes. As for the Holy Beings of other powerful clans such as the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan, they mostly remained silent with a blank expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Murphy did the right thing. Now since Mike's body no longer remains, there is no need for the Evolutionary Universe to exist. Therefore, we should wipe it out completely as soon as possible," Samuel said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings looked at Samuel strangely, while Jeremiah, the Holy Being of Leng Clan laughed and said, "You know, what Samuel said makes sense."</p>

  <p>Samuel was one of the legends in the divine land. It seemed that he was determined to ally the Han Clan with the alliance of powerful clans led by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Aleyna threw Zheng a cautious look. She understood how he felt. The thought of her father going against Zheng's father made her heart ache.</p>

  <p>When other warriors of Han Clan heard their Holy Emperor, they felt a bit disappointed. They had always been proud of their own clan, but their Holy Emperor was creating unnecessary allegiances with other clans.</p>

  <p>The thought of this sickened them.</p>

  <p>"Since Holy Murphy is unable to come, we don't need to wait," the consummate True God of Sun Blind race said. He turned around and kneeled towards the depths of the island. At the same time, all the members of Sun Blind race knelt down and kowtowed in one direction.</p>

  <p>"Leader, please preside over the Astronomical Transit Day ceremony," the consummate True God of Sun Blind race said loudly.</p>

  <p>'The leader of Sun Blind race?' Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>His heart was filled with anticipation as he wondered who the leader of Sun Blind race might be. Was the leader also a Holy Being? It was possible or else the Hall of Holy Beings wouldn't have taken part in the Astronomical Transit Day ceremony. Did they participate because the members of Sun Blind race could ferry people in the Time Sea?</p>

  <p>Since these powerful clans were able to build transmission arrays to the major forbidden areas, they could also build transmission arrays which would lead directly to every place in the divine land. What they needed to do was change the rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng saw a woman wearing a white robe.</p>

  <p>She was barefoot and was walking quite slowly. As she approached, Zheng noticed that she was wearing a strange mask that completely covered her face.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt as if the woman was not real. As she slowly walked over, her figure was like a candle light that was blown by the night wind, in a trance.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the woman was shuttling back and forth in another space.</p>

  <p>She kept disappearing and reappearing continuously. Everyone thought that she wasn't real and was just an illusion.</p>

  <p>What surprised Zheng even more was that almost all the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings present rose and bowed to the woman.</p>

  <p>'Isn't a Holy Being the supreme existence of the divine land?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the status of this woman was higher than the rest.</p>

  <p>He looked at Aleyna with a confused expression and asked telepathically, "Aleyna, what's so special about the leader of Sun Blind race? Since she is just a divine citizen, why did all the Holy Beings bow to her?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna gave him a faint smile and said, "This is because she has the right to decide the life and death of every living creature in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Every living creature? Even a Holy Being?" Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>Aleyna nodded. "Yes, she has the right to decide their fate, even if one's a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>"But how is this possible? This makes her capable of killing anyone she desires."</p>

  <p>Zheng was in awe. If any of the Holy Beings waved their hand, the whole Sun Blind race would probably be wiped out.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Aleyna. "Among all these people present here, she can kill anyone she desires except for three. And only seven or eight people in the entire divine land can't be killed by her. The others have no power over her."</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" Zheng asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Take a guess," Aleyna playfully teased Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race was a mysterious race in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>However, as a core member of the family, Aleyna always had the opportunity to learn some secrets that the others did not know. And the other core disciples knew about it as well.</p>
