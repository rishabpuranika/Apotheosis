<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1010 The Power Behind the Heavenly Evil Sect (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Right now, things were at a standstill. It was as if both sides were cautiously keeping an eye on each other's movement, trying to sound out their opponent's intentions and next move. One of them would eventually lose patience, and once that happened, the final battle would commence.</p>

  <p>"So Ning Yudie is still in the Oracle City, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Fernandez gave him no direct response and instead said earnestly, "Luo Luo Zheng, the Cloud Hall needs you."</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Luo Zheng replied. Now that things had come to this point, he didn't have any intentions of backing down. Ning Yudie had gone too far this time. How could she not tell him about something as important as this?</p>

  <p>"Our leader seems to be in a bad mood recently," Fernandez uttered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was surprised at the sudden comment, but he of course understood what Fernandez was hinting at. He smiled wryly, not knowing how to explain the whole thing to Fernandez.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Fernandez said, "It's normal for men to have several wives.</p>

  <p>Back in the day, I had more than twenty women. It is not so complicated, but keeping a woman happy requires that you woo her the right way."</p>

  <p>Fernandez could only freely speak these words to Luo Luo Zheng in this circumstance.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie was in the Cloud Hall, he never would have dared to say anything about this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was very astonished at his subtle advice. Fernandez, despite his old appearance now, must have been quite the charmer in his younger days.</p>

  <p>For a warrior, having more than one wife was not uncommon of difficult.</p>

  <p>The status of a warrior in the Central Region was almost equivalent to that of an immortal. Even the poorest warrior would be a thousand times richer than an ordinary mortal. With this status, women naturally abounded around the warriors.</p>

  <p>Fernandez left Luo Luo Zheng with these words. Luo Luo Zheng remained standing on the balcony, looking thoughtfully at the rolling clouds above the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Would a woman really become happy again after I please her?"</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Luo Zheng returned to his room. He found Mu Ning having just finished her bath. Her black hair was damp as she was tying it behind her head. She was wearing only her undergarments, and her skin glowed with an appealing luster.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," Luo Luo Zheng said to her.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" Mu Ning asked.</p>

  <p>"The Oracle City," replied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Mu Ning said with a smile. She would not ask Luo Luo Zheng for his reasons if he was not telling her himself. In the past, she would have questioned him relentlessly, but now she didn't think she had to do that.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that her personality had changed, but her thinking and perception had.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had already come to think of Luo Luo Zheng as the only person she would rely on in her life. At the same time, she understood that her feelings were not returned. They had made love once in the underground palace, but it was something that was forced, unlike the natural course of lovers.</p>

  <p>This man who was asking her to come with him did not love her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning understood this clearly.</p>

  <p>He was with her only because of duty.</p>

  <p>With this knowledge, Mu Ning had carefully maintained her distance. She did not ask Luo Luo Zheng for favors, nor did she make any requests or demands. If she were to cling to him, he might grow tired of her and leave. She was at peace with the fact that Luo Luo Zheng might never return her affections. It was enough that she could be by his side.</p>

  <p>Women were indeed strange creatures. In the short span of a few months, Xi Youqin's relationship with Luo Luo Zheng had undergone such a drastic change. She was always mindful and guarded while staying with him, and yet, she felt small flutters of joy in their connection, even if it also bore hints of pain.</p>

  <p>After the two of them made quick preparations, they left the Cloud Hall and entered the Cloudy City, stepping into the transmission array. Mu Ning and Luo Luo Zheng disappeared into the space tunnel arm in arm, with only a flash of blinding whiteness signaling their departure.</p>

  <p>Things were not good in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Ever since the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall declared war on the Heavenly Evil Sect, more and more merchants started leaving the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The numerous wealthy merchants played a huge role in running the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>These merchants were not warriors. Most of them did not know how to fight, and even the very few had skills and were only at the nature level of cultivation. They would not be of any use in battle. However, the wealth they possessed and controlled was far greater than the vast majority of warriors. Even those at the Virtual Tribulation Realm did not come close to them in terms of money or property.</p>

  <p>The entire World Commercial Alliance was formed by these merchants.</p>

  <p>These merchants knew their trades like the back of their own hands, but there was nothing they could do about the sect war. The only way for them to secure the safety of their own lives was to leave. Since the start of the war, more and more of them had chosen to temporarily leave the Oracle City to seek refuge in other cities.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance valued money above everything else. Its members, who had control of the city's economy, knew very well that as long as they had money, there would always be warriors who would work for them. This was the main reason why the World Commercial Alliance became a sixth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>The light of the transmission array constantly flickered, transporting people to and from places. In a flash of white, Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning finally appeared at the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>There was a long queue of merchants lining up in front of the transmission array to leave the Oracle City. Suddenly, a beautiful man and woman appeared. The sight of them caught the attention of everyone around them as the people's eyes looked at them admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning could step out of the transmission array, a voice rang out.</p>

  <p>The voice sounded familiar, but it was a faint memory. Luo Luo Zheng could not remember exactly to whom it belonged. He looked towards the source of the sound and saw a handsome young man looking at him with a smile.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened as he finally put a face and name to the voice. "Owen?" It had been more than two years, but Luo Luo Zheng would recognize the person in front of him with a single glance anywhere.</p>

  <p>The young man was the divine-level talent from the Woollen Grassland.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Owen had participated in the Martial Arts Contest with a goal that was surprisingly similar: both of them were trying to kill Marilyn to prevent Eddie from creating the Lustful Demon Array.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, Owen had failed. He was defeated by Marilyn, and his loss cost him dearly. She almost destroyed his entire body.</p>
