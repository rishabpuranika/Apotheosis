  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan could kill his opponent with a single Law Spear Strike only when, he saw directly through his opponent's flaw.</p>

  <p>This was because he had to employ the Law Spear Strike at the very moment he discovered the flaw. If he were to see his opponent's flaw, but not use the Law Spear Strike to attack, the spear strike would then become of ordinary strength, displaying only very little power.</p>

  <p>Maha had speculated that Nathan's Truth Divine Dao was useless, so he simply allowed Nathan's spear to pierce through his chest!</p>

  <p>As the spear pierced through Maha's body, a burst of fervent cheers sounded throughout the Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng had appeared, Nathan had been the most famous Godly Genius of the younger generation. Everyone thought that his Truth Divine Dao and Law Spear Strike were magical and formidable.</p>

  <p>A few people said that once one cultivated the Law Spear Strike to a certain level, they could even see through the flaws of the entire universe. If they thrust the spear into the universe, the entire universe would collapse.</p>

  <p>And, in many ways, that wasn't wrong. The universe created by the Holy Being was not perfect, and it also had its flaws. However, in order to cultivate the Truth Divine Dao to such a very high level and destroy the universe with a single spear strike, one had to reach the cultivation level of Holy Being.</p>

  <p>It was due to the various legends that caused Nathan to be the number one Godly Genius. It was only after Luo Luo Zheng used the Magnetic Sacred Mountain to break the Law Spear Strike and heavily beat Nathan that Luo Luo Zheng took his place and became the number one Godly Genius instead.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, within the Dead Water World, something was also going simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin began to speak anxiously, "He has failed!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum, pull him back!"</p>

  <p>Sending Nathan over was originally a risky move and the Supreme Lords had already planned this possibility out.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum reached out and gently turned his hand, causing streams of Space Law power to spread from his body. The brilliant white light that formed by the Space Law extended to an immeasurable distance. Aside from Nathan, several grand world lords of the human race had also been sent to other supreme worlds to slaughter the Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>That was when Supreme Lord Healum attempted to pull Nathan back from the Sunflower Water World!</p>

  <p>This Heavenly Destiny could not be considered powerful, but when cooperating with other people, it was extremely effective. It was capable of projecting anyone into any place, and then pulling them back at any time.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Healum was given quite the surprise as he tried to pull Nathan out. "Oh no, I can't draw him back!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord of Original Sin heard Supreme Lord Healum speak, he silently closed his eyes, as if he had somehow anticipated this occurrence.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords also frowned.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is that reddish purple light? It's not something related to the domain!"</p>

  <p>"It is completely impossible for an ordinary domain to stop Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock!"</p>

  <p>"It's probably some kind of Divine Dao. We've never seen it before..."</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords present began to discuss with one another.</p>

  <p>They had already discovered that something was wrong and were beginning to worry. Ultimately, it turned out that what they had guessed was actually right.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum didn't give up!</p>

  <p>With a sudden wave of his hands, he actually succeeded in cutting off a few other Space Locks. The white band of light that was linked to Nathan had suddenly doubled in thickness. Despite that though, no matter how hard Supreme Lord Healum pulled, he was unable to pull Nathan back!</p>

  <p>This wasn't a question of strength though, but rather, the Space Law had completely lost its effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Maha might have had Nathan's spear stabbing out of his body, but right then, he raised his head to look. He had long since felt the existence of the Space Lock. He even activated a Roaring Token, and uttered,</p>

  <p>"Although I don't know which Supreme Lord is taking action now, there is no doubt that your efforts will be in vain. Don't waste your efforts!"</p>

  <p>And once the words left his mouth, the originally hidden Space Lock instantly revealed its true form. This Space Lock came from far away and connected itself to Nathan's back. Moreover, it was currently shaking violently!</p>

  <p>Maha's blade gently reverberated in the air, carving out a crimson band of light. As the blade cut down onto the band of light, it actually instantly broke apart the Space Lock! With a quick wave of Maha's hand, his blade changed directions and began chopping toward Nathan.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Beneath the gushing golden blood, the blade had already completely penetrated Nathan's chest.</p>

  <p>Warriors like Nathan and Maha had all sorts of methods for protecting themselves. Nathan's greatest method of protection this time around was Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock of course, and in addition, he equally had a Cup of Life in his possession. This Cup of Life was gifted to him by the patriarch of Janet Ji's clan, and it was said that it could grant Nathan his second life.</p>

  <p>As Nathan's life energy continued to fade away, the Cup of Life was also activated and it continuously helped Nathan replenish his life energy.</p>

  <p>From his position, Nathan was still conscious and he wasn't giving up.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how hard he struggled or how much force he used, pulling the long spear out of Maha's body seemed completely impossible.</p>

  <p>"It's best if you just stop trying. In this space, I am an invincible existence,"</p>

  <p>Maha said smilingly.</p>

  <p>Nathan held his silence.</p>

  <p>Nathan was used to this tone of voice. In fact, he was usually the one employing it. He had never expected that someone would use this same tone against him, and would be going to kill him.</p>

  <p>Overall though, he knew he would accept being defeated by Maha.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng came to Nathan's mind.</p>

  <p>What would Luo Luo Zheng do if he was in such a position when fighting Maha?</p>

  <p>Would he be capable of breaking through this space?</p>

  <p>As Nathan mulled this over, the life energy in the Cup of Life that the Ji Clan's patriarch created was consumed completely. There was nothing left. Even worse, nearly all of the golden blood in Nathan's body had equally been consumed, and he was starting to look mighty pale. He opened his dry, pasty mouth and said with a sneer, "Do you really think you're invincible? There will always be someone stronger who can defeat you!"</p>

  <p>"You mean Luo Luo Zheng, right?" Maha looked down at Nathan.</p>

  <p>Nathan earnestly nodded his head to accentuate his words. After all, Luo Luo Zheng was truly perhaps the only warrior in the entire universe that could kill Maha.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for him for a long time, but he's just a coward. It's a pity that you won't watch me kill that little brat." Maha shook his head anew and gently wielded the blade in his hand. Nathan suddenly felt a sharp pain in his physical body. He gradually lost consciousness and fell down, slamming hard onto the hill below.</p>

  <p>Another burst of fervent cheer came from Iron Moon City. These cheers, of course, were coming from the Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>To the contrary though, all the martial artists in the Evolutionary Universe were currently silent instead and even had a look of utmost depression carved on their faces.</p>

  <p>Every time Maha killed a human warrior, he would announce his victory to everyone in the universe. This time however, he didn't do so. Not too far away, Connie rushed over and threw herself into Maha's arms.</p>

  <p>"Maha, why don't you use the Roaring Token to announce the result? Let me help you do that!" she said in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>In her opinion, killing Nathan was a great honor.</p>

  <p>However, Maha just shook his head. "No need. I've come to the Sunflower Water World to suppress the Evolutionary Universe's momentum. The effect of killing ordinary martial artists is very good.</p>

  <p>However, it's better to not announce Nathan's death to the universe."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Connie asked, as she blinked hard a few times.</p>

  <p>"Because something will develop in the opposite direction as it reaches the extreme." Maha smiled. "Anyway, there's probably someone even more anxious than I to announce the result to everyone in the universe."</p>

  <p>Maha might also be able to figure out what the human Supreme Lords were thinking of.</p>

  <p>If someone like Nathan were to be sacrificed, it would definitely arouse the anger of the entire universe. It would even be able to greatly reverse the universe's momentum. Maha had obviously predicted this situation.</p>

  <p>However, he wouldn't let Nathan off the hook just because of that, as it would only be counterproductive. Even if the universe's 'momentum' was greatly strengthened by Nathan's death, Maha would still have killed a Godly Genius, which was still a good thing for him.</p>

  <p>And on top of everything else, this Godly Genius was once the number one Godly Genius of the universe!</p>

  <p>Not a sound could be heard coming from the Dead Water World.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords remained completely silent.</p>

  <p>"How did that guy manage?" Supreme Lord Healum questioned. "How did he cut off my Space Lock?" he continued. His face was filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>His Space Lock was the Law of Causality from the Heavenly Destiny, so how could this Law of Causality be so easily cut off by someone?</p>

  <p>"There could only be one reason." Wynn's voice was suddenly heard by all of them.</p>

  <p>"And what would that be?" Supreme Lord Healum asked.</p>

  <p>"Maha cultivates another Divine Dao, the Grand World Technique. He cultivates two Divine Dao at the same time, actually. One is the Great Dominance Technique and the other is the Grand World Technique. The area that the light covers is his world, so naturally, he has the ability to sever your Space Lock," Wynn replied.</p>
