  <p>The consummate True Gods in the Snake Spirit Region simultaneously used the Grand Teleportation technique and spread out their soul power, trying to find Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods searched for him for quite a while before gathering together again.</p>

  <p>Troy was standing in the crowd, his face darkening with every passing second. He hadn't expected Luo Zheng to force him away at the last moment, leaving him no opportunity to attack him.</p>

  <p>He looked doubtful. Everything was happening in a strange manner, as if Luo Zheng had known beforehand that he was going to use his Topsoil Bell.</p>

  <p>Had someone among them revealed this to Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Troy's gaze shifted to Lowell at this thought.</p>

  <p>He had always been skeptical about Lowell's background and had even questioned Iris publicly.</p>

  <p>But Iris was loyal to her husband and refused to tell Troy anything.</p>

  <p>He still believed that if anyone were to betray them, it would most likely be Lowell.</p>

  <p>In the Immortal Mansion...</p>

  <p>Saul, Harold, Hallet, and the others gathered in the square.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready now?" Augustus asked as he stared at the center of the square where Xun stood, carrying a long spear.</p>

  <p>Her charming face looked nervous as she nodded.</p>

  <p>Hallet snapped his fingers and the enchanted barrier that had protected the Immortal Mansion suddenly disappeared, as if it had only been an illusion all along.</p>

  <p>The moment the enchanted barrier disappeared, Xun would enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion wasn't exactly small, but it had been a stretch, having had to move around only within the confines of the palace throughout all these years.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, after years of cultivation, Xun had finally grasped a Divine Dao and become a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Grasping a Divine Dao was probably not too difficult, but escaping the punishment of the Ruling Slate was in no way an easy task.</p>

  <p>To help her, Harold had gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain before, and had sneaked into the Evolutionary Universe through the passageway there.</p>

  <p>This had been risky for Harold. For if the Holy Beings had discovered his movements, he would have fallen into great trouble. However, during the past ten years that Luo Zheng had been absent, his wives had become more and more worried about him. They had constantly begged for Harold's help, and he had had no other choice but to help them.</p>

  <p>Harold obtained the golden blood from Wynn after sneaking into the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Harold wanted to invite Wynn to return to the divine land since he had originally been a member of the divine land. But Wynn refused. In his current state, Wynn knew that he couldn't be of any help even if he returned to the divine land. He was more inclined to stay in the Evolutionary Universe and stand guard there.</p>

  <p>Harold brought the golden blood to the Immortal Mansion and a new hope to Xun, Yudie, and Aura.</p>

  <p>Before that, they couldn't have entered the divine land by normal means even if they had become True Gods and thus become ordinary creatures to avoid being turned into life vitality. They were still regarded as invaders and would eventually be punished by the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>But the whole situation changed, now that the golden blood had come into the picture. This made the three women cultivate with a renewed diligence.</p>

  <p>Xun's strength had originally been far greater than Yudie's. But Yudie, who had been cultivating day and night in the training tower, quickly caught up with her and they reached the True God Realm at almost the same time.</p>

  <p>Harold had removed the enchanted barrier today in order to help them sneak into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Once the enchanted barrier was removed, light began to flash on the Ruling Slate in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>A blue lightning simultaneously streaked across the sky above the Immortal Mansion, followed by a huge black print of a palm.</p>

  <p>This was similar to the time when Luo Zheng had sneaked into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes narrowed in concentration once she saw the palm print above her. Without a word, she raised the long spear in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't move. It can't find you," Harold warned.</p>

  <p>Xun pursed her lips and nodded once.</p>

  <p>She was born to be a warrior and always wanted to fight back in the face of any threats.</p>

  <p>But the energy in this black palm print was too terrifying. She could not see how the energy had been formed, and she knew that it was difficult to resist it by herself.</p>

  <p>The palm print hovered in the air for a while.</p>

  <p>Since Xun's blood had changed, it was impossible for the palm print to sense Xun's location.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, the palm print turned into a black ball and exploded with a mighty blast.</p>

  <p>Its pieces spread over the square, like a huge net covering the area.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng had been entangled by the net, and it had caused his communication with his inner world to be cut off. He had also not been able to use his chaotic energy for some time.</p>

  <p>Xun watched the huge net fall towards her and tried to avoid it. But she wasn't quick enough.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Harold grabbed Xun's shoulder and pulled her to the side, causing the net to miss its target and fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Okay! I didn't expect that the omnipotent Ruling Slate could be deceived like this! Holy Mike is really a genius!" Augustus said, grinning.</p>

  <p>What most True Gods in the divine land feared most was not a Holy Being like Nicholas, but the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>As long as one could afford enough divine might coins, they could control everything in the divine land through the Ruling Slate. It was much more powerful than a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Even if a Holy Being broke the rules of the Ruling Slate, they would have to obediently accept the punishment, which was why Augustus was greatly surprised to see Xun evade the punishment of the Ruling Slate after her blood had been changed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Master came up with this idea. I think it was Holy Jay,"</p>

  <p>Harold said.</p>

  <p>Augustus shrugged and looked at the training tower. "Next one!" he said.</p>

  <p>Yudie had only recently grasped the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao. That was why they had decided to sneak into the divine land today.</p>

  <p>Harold opened the gates of the training tower and let Yudie out.</p>

  <p>Before this, Luo Nian, Aura, and Freya had taken their places on the second floor of the training tower so they wouldn't be affected.</p>

  <p>Yudie had already triggered the Ruling Slate just when she walked out of the training tower.</p>

  <p>Things happened in the same manner as Xun had experienced before. After thunder exploded in the sky, a black palm print appeared, replacing the thunder. With Harold's help, she successfully deceived the Ruling Slate as well.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. You can both move around freely in the divine land from now on," Harold said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Yudie smiled and nodded at him. "Thank you for your help," she said gratefully.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes flashed with concern as she stared at Harold. "Can we leave the Immortal Mansion now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Yudie looked nervous at Xun's question.</p>

  <p>In the past ten years, they had lost contact with Luo Zheng again, and they had become worried.</p>

  <p>They had been apart from Luo Zheng in the past, but this time, things seemed different. He had disappeared almost suddenly the moment he had met his mother.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the information that Harold had collected through different channels, had made them even more worried.</p>

  <p>"Why are you in such a hurry?" Augustus chuckled.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded along and said, "The divine land is too vast. It will be impossible for you to find him if you go out now. You will also encounter a lot of danger if you go outside."</p>

  <p>"But we can't just stay here doing nothing," Yudie said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the best thing that we can do is wait patiently," Harold sighed.</p>

  <p>He had never thought that taking Luo Zheng to the Han Clan's ancestral land would attract the attention of the Holy Beings and cause such a predicament.</p>
