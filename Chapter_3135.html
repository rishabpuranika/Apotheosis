<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned when he heard the young woman in white call herself a maid. "Maids?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and nodded. "Yes. You can call me Trish."</p>

  <p>"I'm Carrie," the other woman in white said, introducing herself.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "Why you two are maids."</p>

  <p>"This place has been given to you by the sword sect. Everything in it belongs to you, including us," said Trish.</p>

  <p>"Are the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect also treated like this?" Zheng asked, persistent in his questions.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Trish replied firmly, nodding her head.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't met any other disciples on his way to the Flow Sword Sect. He had only met several women dressed in white, like Trish and Carrie.</p>

  <p>He had been a little curious at the time, but it was only now that he realized that all of them were maids of the disciples of the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>"Can I just live here without a maid?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Since the Flow Sword Sect had given him such a large courtyard, Zheng could even invite Yudie and the others to stay with him. He didn't need anyone taking care of him.</p>

  <p>Trish was disappointed. "We are responsible for conveying the news of the sword sect and need to deal with a lot of things for you. I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to adapt to this place without us."</p>

  <p>"Moreover, it's our duty to serve you. If you don't need us, we will be asked to leave the mountain," Carrie added.</p>

  <p>The disappointment on both their faces roused sympathy in Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had just entered this place, which was why he hadn't been able to adapt to it yet. And as Trish had said, there must be a reason why everyone had maids to take care of them.</p>

  <p>When in Rome, do as the Romans do. And it would be rude to drive them away.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, you can all stay here. But you don't need to serve me when I take a bath," Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie looked at each other, nodding happily.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the white clothes and shoes and went to the room in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had left, Carrie whispered to Trish, "Trish, Mr. Luo's cultivation base seems to be low. I've noticed that the warriors that the other maids serve seem to be stronger than him."</p>

  <p>Trish shook her head and replied, "The Flow Sword Sect only cares about and appreciates his potential, but not his strength. Have you heard about Milo? His cultivation base was also at just the first stage of the Other Shore Realm when he arrived here. But he then made great progress and became a super powerful warrior."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Mr. Luo is as talented as Milo?" Carrie asked, her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Flow Sword Sect knew Milo. Even Carrie had heard of him.</p>

  <p>"No," said Trish, shaking her head. "There are only a few talents like Milo in the entire Oneness Sky Palace. Few people can compare with him. But I also think Mr. Luo is not that bad."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Mr. Luo will let us sleep with him?" Carrie asked.</p>

  <p>Trish blushed at her words and asked shyly, "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>These maids had been selected by the Flow Sword Sect from the Bloom Divine Province. Their cultivation base was okay and all of them had reached the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Every time a warrior joined the Flow Sword Sect, maids would be assigned to the new disciples.</p>

  <p>If the maids performed well while serving the disciples, they would receive rewards from the Flow Sword Sect. Some maids even fell into romantic relationships with the disciples and even married them in order to cultivate together.</p>

  <p>The strong smell of medicine wafted out of a big bathtub from the bathroom, shrouded in steam.</p>

  <p>"Everyone can do whatever they want without any taboos or restrictions.</p>

  <p>The Flow Sword Sect is so special!" Zheng muttered, smiling.</p>

  <p>The Flow Sword Sect was far beyond Zheng's comprehension.</p>

  <p>There was no one to instruct him and help him understand the ways of the sword sect. But the house he had been assigned had satisfied him.</p>

  <p>Everything confused him here and he couldn't understand why the sword sect treated the disciples in such a strange way. Zheng needed to figure it out bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled on his clothes once he emerged from the bath.</p>

  <p>He looked different in the white clothes, more energetic and refreshed.</p>

  <p>Once he emerged from the room, the two maids walked up to him.</p>

  <p>Trish said, "Mr. Luo, if you are tired, I'll go make the bed for you. It is our lunch break now."</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned at this.</p>

  <p>Try as he might to adapt to this lifestyle, every second he spent here simply blew his mind.</p>

  <p>A warrior, irrespective of whether or not they had a high cultivation base, would be full of energy all day long and didn't need lunch breaks.</p>

  <p>'Is this a place for cultivation? Or is it for vacation?' Zheng thought to himself in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Do the others do the same?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Trish nodded and smiled. "Yes."</p>

  <p>She had expected Zheng to have such a reaction.</p>

  <p>Every Other Shore Realm warrior who had just arrived here reacted the same way as Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"They don't need to cultivate?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"The way you live here is considered cultivation in the Flow Sword Sect," said Trish.</p>

  <p>"Well, let me see what they intend to do," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's original plan, he should have started cultivating by now.</p>

  <p>He could either practice the Sword Texture Technique or go to the Other Shore, but he was doing nothing.</p>

  <p>He walked leisurely around the yard. When it was time to take the noon break or go to bed at night, he went to sleep alone.</p>

  <p>He didn't need to sleep. Even when he was lying on the bed, he was only meditating.</p>

  <p>During the daytime, he stepped out of the courtyard and walked along the alley, only encountering a few women in white who were passing by.</p>

  <p>Zheng had thought to find a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect to clarify a few doubts. But a week passed and he was yet to meet a disciple.</p>

  <p>'Do these people stay in their rooms all the time? Or am I the only disciple in the entire Flow Sword Sect?' he thought.</p>

  <p>As time went by, he got more and more confused.</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted to knock on one of the other doors to ask around about what was going on. But the moment he walked through the gate of a courtyard, the women in white shut the door in his face.</p>

  <p>He ended up staying away and not knocking on any door.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head as he walked back along the alley.</p>

  <p>On his way back, he could hear the women laughing and whispering in the other courtyards. He knew what had happened without even looking inside.</p>

  <p>'Oh my God! What the hell is this place?'</p>

  <p>Zheng found this place to be even more mysterious and dangerous than all the places he had explored so far.</p>

  <p>His lips curled up in a curious yet wary smile as he made his way back alone.</p>

  <p>He wasn't someone who could waste time while leading an idle life. He had even begun to miss his days in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>No one was paying much attention to him. So he found a quiet corner in his own courtyard, set up a restriction array, and started to cultivate the Sword Texture Technique.</p>

  <p>He cultivated this way for half a month. Once he finished cultivating, he handed a space ring to Trish and asked her to give it to Monica, who was in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Within the ring sat the Sword-reading Liquid. Before going up the mountain, Zheng had agreed that Monica could get 30% of the profit once the Sword-reading Liquid was sold, and he would take the rest of it. He would replenish the Sword-reading Liquid once every month.</p>

  <p>Trish was capable, and it only took her one day to take the ring back.</p>

  <p>Zheng counted and found that there were nearly twenty million divine crystals in it.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo, what is in this space ring? It looks mysterious," Trish asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing extraordinary," Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders. He wasn't going to tell anyone about the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>He was about to put away his space ring when a resounding bell chime sounded from the distance.</p>
