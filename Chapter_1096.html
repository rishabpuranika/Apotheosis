  <p>
</p>

  <p>Marine nodded and said, "Your Majesty, I am not mistaken!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of War Emperor York flashed like two poisonous snakes as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng. He had already been convinced by the Holy Maiden but now that the man in front of him was a representative of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, he couldn't act rashly. He controlled himself before asking the question he was dreading the answer to, "Kid, did you kill my son Daniel?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shrugged, his face stoic as he replied, "I don't know who Daniel is, nor do I know this woman. And I definitely don't know what you're talking about!"</p>

  <p>Turner couldn't contain himself any more. Two of his men from the Harlen Divine Kingdom had been defeated. Not only the crown prince had recommended Tianxing to fight, even Randy had thought highly of him.</p>

  <p>Now that Tianxing was being questioned by War Emperor York, he could no longer remain silent as the king of the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Lucien Liu, Tianxing belongs to our Harlen Divine Kingdom. He has already said that he is not the person you are looking for. Isn't it inappropriate to make things difficult for him like this?" Turner asked patiently.</p>

  <p>Lucien Liu was the name of the War Emperor York. The entire York Divine Kingdom belonged to the Liu Clan. In theory, the York Divine Kingdom could be considered an eighth grade noble clan.</p>

  <p>Randy paled a little. He knew that Luo Zheng's origins were shrouded in mystery and someone with such talent couldn't have been a nameless person before. Randy and the crown prince had already secretly investigated Luo Zheng's identity and background and both had received shocking news about him - he did not come from the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Since they hadn't been able to find any information about Tianxing, they began investigating the guard standing with Luo Luo Zheng. The result of this investigation puzzled them even more. This Life and Death Realm warrior called Francis actually belonged to the York Divine Kingdom and was also a steward of the secret sect.</p>

  <p>Such results made Luo Zheng's identity seem all the more confusing. Of course, not that Randy cared much about Luo Zheng's identity, but the key was that Luo Luo Zheng could help Randy, and that was enough for him.</p>

  <p>As to the crown prince...</p>

  <p>Now, Bram was sure that what Marine had said was true. This fellow, who went by the name Tianxing must be from the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The crown prince, Bram, had wanted Luo Luo Zheng to represent him in battle, but Luo Luo Zheng hadn't moved an inch, making it clear to Bram that he wasn't going to listen to him. So of course, Bram wouldn't come forward to speak for Luo Luo Zheng. But he wouldn't step up to expose Luo Zheng's identity either. After all, Luo Luo Zheng now fought for and represented the Harlen Divine Kingdom. It was impossible for Bram to do something that would put the Harlen Divine Kingdom at a disadvantage. If he did, his father would be greatly disappointed.</p>

  <p>Yet, right after Turner finished speaking, War Emperor York ignored him and snorted coldly. He looked at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "I don't need you to speak the truth. I will search your soul myself."</p>

  <p>As War Emperor York pointed a finger at Luo Luo Zheng, powerful energy radiating from his soul spread out from the spot between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"It's a soul attack! War Emperor York has actually directly used his soul attack!"</p>

  <p>"A powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm can turn a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm into a moron by using just his oppressing force of soul. I never thought that War Emperor York would attack a young man using the soul attack!"</p>

  <p>"The warrior called Tianxing is doomed!"</p>

  <p>Moments ago, there had been a lot of Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists clamoring in the plaza, almost getting into a fight. One of the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm released his soul force and suppressed all the Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>The soul oppressing force was not used to hurt people. The masters usually released their formidable power of the soul force just to intimidate crowds. However, the souls of mighty masters at the Soul Sea Realm were usually very powerful. If they used all of their soul oppressing force to frighten a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it would be enough to turn him into a moron.</p>

  <p>And right about now, War Emperor York had directly used a soul attack.</p>

  <p>He wanted to erase Luo Zheng's consciousness and search his soul. That was the only direct and simple method to solve the problem he was facing. But as Luo Zheng's soul was scoured and the memories extracted, he would suffer mental damage to a great extent. In simpler terms, Luo Luo Zheng would become just a simpleton, if War Emperor York was to search his soul.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that War Emperor York didn't care whether Luo Luo Zheng lived or not.</p>

  <p>"Lucien Liu!"</p>

  <p>Turner's face drained of color. He hadn't expected Lucien to do this, to act without any warning. Turner had had no time to stop him.</p>

  <p>It was clear as day that War Emperor York wasn't afraid of Turner. He knew that Turner would not look for trouble with him just because of an unimportant Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. So he decided to go ahead with what he wanted.</p>

  <p>As everyone watched in mounting horror, the wave of soul energy charged at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze flickered with a faint light as he stared apathetically at War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had sensed the power of this soul energy ever since it had come out.</p>

  <p>His soul was now very close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm and any soul below this realm wouldn't be able to harm him much.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that this soul force was released from a soul that belonged to the Fighting Soul Realm. Luo Luo Zheng wasn't afraid of it at all.</p>

  <p>So he stood calmly in the sky, his face completely expressionless. But he was on high alert, wary of War Emperor York. The fact that War Emperor York had obtained the title of war emperor meant that he was one of the top masters of the Soul Sea Realm. If this person wanted to kill Luo Luo Zheng, he wouldn't be able to survive in the first round of the fight with him.</p>

  <p>But the issue here was that War Emperor wanted to kill him before clarifying anything. He didn't seem to care about what anyone else had to say.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't bothered about suffering the soul attack. The problem was that he was being targeted by War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not choose to fight back, nor did he summon the cyan dragon to devour the soul attack that War Emperor York was unleashing. And right now, Luo Luo Zheng had to only endure it all because if he fought back, War Emperor York might seriously take him on.</p>

  <p>Even an ordinary master of the Soul Sea Realm whose soul had just entered the Fighting Soul Realm would not be able to withstand the attack of War Emperor York. With the powerful soul attack crushing on the ordinary master, the person's soul would soon be injured or even disintegrate.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York's powerful soul attack poured into Luo Zheng's soul continuously. But Luo Zheng's soul was incomparably tough, and constantly flickered with a jade-green light. No harm was done to it.</p>

  <p>"His soul has probably shattered."</p>

  <p>"He didn't move an inch! He will definitely become a moron!"</p>

  <p>"What a pitiful fellow! He shouldn't have offended War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York is certainly not someone to be trifled with."</p>

  <p>As the many Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors saw this powerful soul attack, their fear began to etch itself on their faces. Although this attack wasn't directed at them, they could feel a small portion of the domineering force from the soul attack reflected onto them. And that was enough to make them shiver.</p>

  <p>Randy closed his eyes and furrowed his eyebrows. Even though he hadn't known Luo Luo Zheng for long, he really admired his great talent and power.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, Luo Luo Zheng was humble and honest, which was also a reason why Randy valued Luo Luo Zheng so much and why he treated Luo Luo Zheng as a true friend.</p>

  <p>If it were any other powerful Soul Sea Realm master who was attacking Luo Luo Zheng, he would have tried to stop him. However, he wasn't able enough to fight against War Emperor York. It was too late even if he wanted to stop him.</p>

  <p>Turner sighed softly and said, "Okay, Lucien Liu. No matter what, he represents our Harlen Divine Kingdom. Do not destroy his life energy!</p>

  <p>Let him live!"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's soul was completely destroyed, his life energy would be gone.</p>

  <p>But it was possible that if Luo Zheng's shattered soul remained in his mind, he would not die. Instead, he would become a simpleton. Turner had had no time to stop Lucien from attacking Luo Luo Zheng, so he could only ask Lucien to spare his life.</p>

  <p>It was better to become a simpleton than to become dead.</p>

  <p>But just as soon as Turner finished talking, a strange expression crossed Lucien's face. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>The situation had become entangled in a tight deadlock for a while.</p>

  <p>Many of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm noticed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>It was not only Turner who felt something strange, but also Scott from the Star Field Divine Kingdom as well as War King Wind from the Wind Divine Kingdom. They were all confused and stared oddly at Luo Luo Zheng before looking over at War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Tianxing's eyes were clear and full of spirit. It looked like he wasn't hurt.</p>

  <p>What was going on?</p>

  <p>Could it be that War Emperor York had saved his strength?</p>

  <p>This was impossible. The four kings had been on their thrones for so many years, and they knew each other's tempers very well.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York Lucien Liu had always been sullen, extremely cold-blooded and arrogant. If he chose to make a move, there was absolutely no possibility of him holding back at all.</p>

  <p>However, Tianxing seemed to be safe and sound. What had happened?</p>

  <p>Back on the stairs, many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had puzzled looks on their faces, unable to understand the situation at all.</p>

  <p>As time passed, not only did the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm feel that something was wrong, even the Life and Death Realm warriors and the other Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had sensed Luo Zheng's abnormality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to have been harmed even a little.</p>
