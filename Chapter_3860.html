<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3860 The Creation Quadrant </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light pillar in the destruction quadrant continued to rise.</p>

  <p>Soon, it touched the ring of light at the very edge of the map.</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues all looked upon the cup.</p>

  <p>Now that there were three light pillars, Luo Zheng was supposedly ready to wake up.</p>

  <p>He obtained the ancestry-level bloodline so easily!</p>

  <p>Yet he remained lying motionless in the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>The bronze statues had no clue that Luo Zheng was also confused.</p>

  <p>As he lay in the darkness, he was positive that he was awake and not in a dream.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't feel himself at all. At the very least, his sense of touch and smell had already left. He couldn't even perceive if he had a corporeal body? it seemed as though he was floating in the darkness as a mere lonely soul.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the soul's eyes and ears remained intact? Luo Zheng could see dots of light in the distance, as well as hear some sounds from his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Murmurs rang in his ears every now and then. Each time a sound came through, the dots of light would spread out like dancing flies.</p>

  <p>It seemed like there was someone chanting incantations? and the light dots were following the commands of said incantations.</p>

  <p>Why was such a thing in his mind, Luo Zheng wondered?</p>

  <p>How long would the state last?</p>

  <p>He received no answer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Source World? something explosive resounded.</p>

  <p>A pit that could hold a great lake suddenly appeared? the brass man smashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the pit, as soon as the goat monster's body was exposed, it was thrown into the air and smacked back down by the brass man.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Another great pit appeared as the goat monster was once again smashed into the ground. Behind them, there were already over twenty lake-sized huge pits.</p>

  <p>While the brass man's series of attacks caused no substantial damage to the goat monster, the latter was at least sufficiently suppressed enough so it had no strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>But with each strike, the brass man released three hundred thousand Jun of force, enough that the other two Black Ship members could hardly bear it any longer.</p>

  <p>The Withering Power and the Power Transfer Lens were both Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, but they consumed divine crystals rapidly.</p>

  <p>At such a consumption rate, it was impractical to crumb divine crystals one after another to replenish the Other Shore Tokens. A single replenishment of such a level cost millions of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Even if the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm were extremely agile, they couldn't possibly crush all the crystals one by one.</p>

  <p>Before entering a battle, they usually prepared a space ring where they collected the many crushed divine crystals? this way, they could replenish their Other Shore Token with divine crystal energy during the battle.</p>

  <p>But the brass man had used the force far too extravagantly.</p>

  <p>Once the Black Ship members replenished divine crystal energy three consecutive times, the spare space ring was already empty.</p>

  <p>"Shera!"</p>

  <p>"Edith!"</p>

  <p>The Black Ship members shifted their eyes to the two, pointing to them at the same time.</p>

  <p>Both Shera and Edith immediately understood what they meant and instantly moved to the front of the two, giving them their spare space rings.</p>

  <p>And so there was a break during the transfer.</p>

  <p>The brass man was pouring his force into the goat monster's body through Luo Zheng, but there was now a sudden break in the force's steady stream.</p>

  <p>As a result, the brass man attacked with only a few thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The goat monster struck a pose, ready to be thrown out again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, it found the impact on it far too gentle and weak.</p>

  <p>It glared at the brass man in surprise.</p>

  <p>When the man looked back at it, his eyes were filled with the same expression.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the brass man lost his strength, its two horns began flashing green light before immediately lowering its head to push the man up with just its horns.</p>

  <p>Each time the Divine Farmer turned into a goat monster, it would kill many people. With its ferocious personality, it refused to stop until it killed the brass man.</p>

  <p>Seeing the horns rushing toward him, the brass man was so anxious that he lifted Luo Zheng up, using him as a shield to cover him.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer ordered the goat monster to take Luo Zheng back before his consciousness disappeared.</p>

  <p>But the goat monster didn't seem to care one bit about what the Divine Farmer was thinking whatsoever. Instead, it rushed right at Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The collision's great impact sent both Luo Zheng and the brass man into the air.</p>

  <p>Because of the "Combat Dragon Absorb", the brass man was still firmly gripping Luo Zheng when the latter once again displayed something miraculous? he was left completely unharmed from the goat monster's attack.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>After having taken quite many beatings from the brass man, the goat monster didn't care to show any mercy toward him now that it finally had its chance for revenge.</p>

  <p>As its pair of strong and powerful rear legs made a leap, its sharp horns with green light pierced toward the brass man once again.</p>

  <p>In terms of real strength, even powerful existences such as Fuxi and Xuanyuan couldn't defeat the goat monster too easily? let alone the brass man who was only at the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he couldn't defeat the goat monster, the brass man had no choice but to place his hopes on Luo Zheng, tightly placing him in front to serve as a shield.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The goat monster then turned into a white shadow before attacking the brass man over and over. The brass man was like a matador, defending himself carefully with Luo Zheng, sweat dripping down his face. He couldn't help but rejoice when he saw how the goat monster was not all that intelligent.</p>

  <p>Because of the goat monster's repeated attacks, another light pillar extended from the quadrant that represented "creation" at the bottom of the sacred cup? it was exactly the same as the one in the destruction quadrant, rising upward.</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues believed Luo Zheng would stop. But they were left dumbfounded again in the face of the new light pillar.</p>

  <p>"There was one in the destruction quadrant just now?but another one is popping out of the creation quadrant?"</p>

  <p>"This light pillar can also reach consummation?"</p>

  <p>"This is the fourth one, and the four light pillars exist in three different quadrants?"</p>

  <p>All of them were speechless as they gazed at the extending light pillar.</p>

  <p>The root-level bloodline that the Divine Farmer inherited was initially born from the creation quadrant.</p>

  <p>The very fact that he had turned himself into a goat monster was a form of creation.</p>

  <p>From its appearance, strength could be displayed in thousands of billions of forms, but in the map of the ancestry-level bloodline, strength would be simply divided into four great quadrants: destruction, creation, life, and space-time. Only small differences existed among the three hundred seventy-three light pillars that focused on various areas.</p>

  <p>The goat monster's attacks directly helped Luo Zheng consummate a light pillar.</p>

  <p>Once it launched over ten attacks in a single shot, the two Black Ship members finally replenished enough divine crystal energy.</p>

  <p>When the Power Transfer Lens once again faced the brass man, his force surged once again.</p>

  <p>Just as the brass man was ready to go against the monster again, a great black shadow suddenly shrouded them from above their heads, swallowing the goat monster with a bang.</p>

  <p>It was a black ship that formed the great black shadow that descended? the captain's real body.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A series of roars emerged from within the ship, but it wasn't broken. It was clear that the goat monster struggled to escape.</p>

  <p>"Captain!"</p>

  <p>The brass man only felt he had endless power to release.</p>

  <p>"You can't kill it. It's an immortal body. Since you've obtained Luo Zheng, don't waste any time. Let's leave as soon as possible," the captain said when he reappeared on the deck like a ghost.</p>
