<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were on Luo Luo Zheng, especially the three leaders Dillon, Hobbes and Haber.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm and while this was a great boost to Cloud Hall's combat powers, his rune skills were far superior to his strength. Naturally, everyone felt that Luo Luo Zheng should join the Runic Tower.</p>

  <p>Everyone believed that Luo Luo Zheng would have no reason to refuse. The World Commercial Alliance might need him to fight against the Heavenly Evil Sect and even Luo Luo Zheng needed to rely on them to fight Eddie.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's answer was unexpected. He shook his head and said, "Mr. Shi, I'm very sorry. I can't enter the Runic Tower right now."</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked a somewhat baffled Dillon.</p>

  <p>"Right now, I don't have enough time to set up an array," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>He drew divine textures, not runes. The amount of time he had spent and the things he had gone through far exceeded the requirements of an ordinary rune. Back then, he had spent almost two months setting up the Small Circulation Killing Array for Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall was only one-tenth of the size of Cloudy City, while Oracle City was more than three times the size of the Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>There simply wasn't enough time to set up a protective array around the vast Oracle City.</p>

  <p>"But don't worry. I will join the fight," he added.</p>

  <p>It was time for him to put an end to the conflict between him and Eddie. But before that, he still had something to worry about. He had not received any news from Yan since the last Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>Eddie had wanted to take Mu Ning, so Luo Luo Zheng assumed that Yan would still be all right. But where was she now? Where was Eddie hiding her? Luo Luo Zheng had no idea at all.</p>

  <p>Dillon knew that he couldn't change Luo Zheng's mind. Back then, the boy was able to fight the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm when he was at the Illuminating Soul Realm. He had crossed an entire realm! And now Luo Luo Zheng had reached the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Would he be able to cross a realm to fight against a master at the Life and Death Realm?</p>

  <p>If he could do this, then it meant that he had become much stronger than Dillon and the other leaders.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, since you have made your choice, I won't force you. You can form a team with the others and follow the army's orders," Dillon said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and left for registration.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was leaving the meeting hall, he saw a white figure shooting down from above, like a meteor, directly smashing through the roof of the hall.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Broken pieces of rocks flew in all directions. Mu Ning, who had been silently following Luo Luo Zheng all this time, cowered behind him like a little scared kitten.</p>

  <p>As a martial artist at the Internal Elixir Realm, she could simply use her protective life vitality to block these flying objects. However, she didn't have any intentions of doing so; the only thing she did was hide behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the dust cleared, they saw that the white figure was Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>She looked miserable.</p>

  <p>Her long black hair, which was pulled into a ponytail and made her look much more vivacious, was now half burnt and scattered on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>There were many wounds on her body, and her clothes were also charred.</p>

  <p>Even her face was covered in bruises.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ning!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Ning! Are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Morphens and a few elders of the Cloud Hall immediately rushed to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ning, did you face the counterattack from the Heavenly Evil Sect?"</p>

  <p>Dillon asked, concern in his voice.</p>

  <p>But Ning Yudie looked relaxed. "I'm fine. I accidentally broke into their trap and got a little injured."</p>

  <p>It turned out that Ning Yudie had sneakily attacked the Heavenly Evil Sect's camp, thousands of miles away. There were more than four thousand independent warriors in the camp. Among them, the weakest had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, and one warrior was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>With the powers of all the warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm combined with Eddie's special fighting technique, the attack was brutal.</p>

  <p>Since Simon and Eddie were not there, Ning Yudie would have been able to take the warriors down. But this time she had underestimated her opponents.</p>

  <p>Darius was the sole warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>From the start, Yudie's strategy had been to kill the only warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. That way she would face no opposition, and killing the rest would be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>However, to her surprise, Darius had been a bait from the start.</p>

  <p>Eddie and Simon hadn't attacked Ning Yudie. Instead they had sent Darius, the main strategist of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom. Darius had always been resourceful. This time, he purposely led thousands of warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm to the camp to wait for Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Everything went as smoothly as he expected. Ning Yudie had stepped into the trap he had laid for her.</p>

  <p>From the moment Ning Yudie had decided to kill Darius, she had already started to walk towards the trap set by him.</p>

  <p>Under Darius's command, over four thousand warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm congregated in a neat and orderly manner. They were like ants to Ning Yudie. But when they united in the war tactics, even Ning Yudie had to take evasive actions.</p>

  <p>That was how Darius had trapped her with ease. He had not only blocked her attack, but also commanded his warriors to kill her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was considered to be extremely powerful. And even when she had fallen into Darius's trap, she was able to force her way out when she unleashed her full power.</p>

  <p>Thousands of warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm had attacked her together, using all kinds of methods. Wind, fire, mountains, lightning and poison surrounded her all at once. That explained her bedraggled appearance.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ning, please stop fighting on your own!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Ning, this time, the Heavenly Evil Sect set up a trap. Next time, they might fight themselves. It's very dangerous. Please think twice!"</p>

  <p>The elders were trying their best to persuade Ning Yudie. They had already tried countless times before, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie suddenly noticed Luo Luo Zheng. She also saw Mu Ning behind him and immediately got angry. That woman was actually hiding behind Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, she seemed to be trying to avoid the rocks that were rolling down from the broken ceiling. How could a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm be afraid of these things?</p>

  <p>This woman was a hypocrite!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie decided to vent internally. She snorted and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng rushed to stop her. He went and stood in front of her. Fernandez's words, "keeping a woman happy requires that you woo her the right way", echoed in his head. But what should he say?</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Ning Yudie looked up and held his gaze, her beautiful eyes shooting daggers at him. She had killed many people recently, so she was tainted with many malicious auras.</p>

  <p>However, apart from the malicious Mu Ning, there was a trace of panic in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes, Haber, and the people from Cloud Hall were all looking expectantly at Luo Luo Zheng. It would be amazing if Luo Luo Zheng was able to persuade her not to leave the Oracle City again. They wondered how he would do it.</p>

  <p>"Tia, don't be stubborn," Luo Luo Zheng said gently, while staring at her earnestly.</p>

  <p>His words left the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the meeting hall speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't think of himself as an outsider, nor did he regard Ning Yudie as the leader.</p>

  <p>His words calmed Ning Yudie, but out of the corner of her eyes, she saw Mu Ning behind him. As she saw the faintly discernible expression on Xi Youqin's face, the warmth in her heart was immediately replaced with anger. She yelled reproachfully, "What did you call me? How dare you call me Tia? I am the leader of Cloud Hall and you are a member, and so you're my subject! Luo Luo Zheng, you should know your place!"</p>

  <p>Watching the drama unfold before him, Dillon could sense that things weren't going right. He wasn't from Cloud Hall, so he didn't know much about the relationship shared by Ning Yudie and Luo Luo Zheng. Although the elders of the Cloud Hall knew everything, they couldn't possibly publicize it outside.</p>

  <p>Morphens couldn't tell Dillon that Ning Yudie acted willfully because she was jealous.</p>

  <p>Dillon rushed to mediate.</p>
