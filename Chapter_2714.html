  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng drew a breath and felt the smell seemed so familiar.</p>

  <p>Before he entered the cave, he had smelled something strange from the gust of the hot wind.</p>

  <p>And unexpectedly at this moment, it appeared once again which made him deeply doubt.</p>

  <p>Leland on the side had his eyes flash a glimmer of light upon seeing the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>He had no further knowledge about what it was but he knew that it was definitely not an ordinary thing.</p>

  <p>He had taken a great risk to come all the way down here. No matter what, he would definitely take the Stone Mouse as his own!</p>

  <p>He looked at the seven people present around him and contemplated.</p>

  <p>Among them, Jalen was no match against him.</p>

  <p>The only person he was wary of was Luo Zheng. Although Luo Zheng was only a consummate True God, he had a variety of methods. He was definitely not as simple as he looked.</p>

  <p>Leland had once speculated that Luo Zheng likely came from a large clan on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He was caught in his own thought not realizing that at this moment, the others were as well concluding their own plans!</p>

  <p>Especially Jalen!</p>

  <p>He previously made a scene and clamored to go back, but after catching sight of the Stone Mouse, he had the same intention just like Leland. His eyes were filled with greed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Leland hadn't made a move yet, he narrowed his eyes and decided to move first!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>It was to no one's expectation to see Jalen suddenly rushing to the Stone Mouse. He was fast enough and in no time, he had grabbed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Jalen! Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>Leland shouted being caught off guard by Jalen's action, his face hardened.</p>

  <p>He had the same thought and wanted to get the Stone Mouse, but he was still rational.</p>

  <p>The path for them to go back was already blocked and they couldn't use Grand Teleportation. So what if he obtained any treasure?</p>

  <p>The first thing that mattered was that he still couldn't leave.</p>

  <p>Rushing out to obtain it first wasn't of importance as he was worrying about such problem in the first place.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, this thing..." Jalen just laughed it off. He gripped the Stone Mouse and grinned, but was frozen in an instant. He lowered his gaze and looked at his hand. It was empty as there was nothing. He asked in surprise, "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked over.</p>

  <p>An incredible scene appeared as if by magic.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse that should have been in Jalen's hands vanished and once again appeared on the altar!</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe their eyes. Luo Zheng frowned at what happened.</p>

  <p>He witnessed how the Stone Mouse quickly vanished from Jalen's hand and returned to the altar. There was even no space fluctuation at all.</p>

  <p>It was logically impossible.</p>

  <p>Leland also felt that something was wrong. "This thing... is weird!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he strode towards the Stone Mouse and swung his hand in an action to grab it. He took two steps back but it felt light in his hand. Under the gazes of the crowd, the Stone Mouse disappeared.</p>

  <p>No one, even him who just grabbed it, had ever witnessed how the Stone Mouse suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>After Leland's action, the other top-rank True Gods walked forward and also tried to do the same.</p>

  <p>After much deliberation, they found out that the Stone Mouse was unable to leave the altar more than three feet. Going further than three feet away, it would then automatically return to its original position.</p>

  <p>They had tried every means like stuffing it into their space ring and some had even placed it into their inner world. But in the end, it was still ineffective whatever they did or wherever they tried to hide it. Once it moved over three feet, it would still return to the altar.</p>

  <p>"It's so strange!"</p>

  <p>"The Space Law doesn't work here. How did this thing achieve that?"</p>

  <p>"This is so strange!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was stumped as nobody knew what to do next.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the only one who didn't take to try to grab it. After a while, he finally asked, "Everyone, don't you feel that the sweet and fishy smell is getting stronger?"</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's words, they all sniffed in the air.</p>

  <p>"Yes, what a weird fragrance..."</p>

  <p>"I have smelled it when we just entered the cave!"</p>

  <p>"Where does the scent come from?"</p>

  <p>It was not until then that everyone turned to focus their attention on the scent.</p>

  <p>The smell filled their nostrils and was gradually getting stronger.</p>

  <p>As they were still wondering, Luo Zheng felt that his soul was slightly itchy.</p>

  <p>Cracking sounds were suddenly heard.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng whipped his head and saw countless snake-shaped cracks spreading rapidly on the cave walls on both sides.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Not only the two sides of the cave, but the same sound resounded from under their feet.</p>

  <p>The cave made of layers of soft stones was crumbling?</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>It wasn't a big deal that the layers of the soft stones cracked, but there were numerous steams of Lethal Fire Magma running out of the cracks!</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed drastically, and the others were all as pale as paper.</p>

  <p>They felt grieved that they had previously exhausted themselves in order to survive the dangerous situations.</p>

  <p>Now that the world around them was collapsing and the Lethal Fire Magma was coming at them like a vast ocean, how could they avoid it?</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I just became a top-rank True God. I never thought that I will die today in this strange place!"</p>

  <p>Those top-rank True Gods all wailed miserably.</p>

  <p>It was only Luo Zheng, Leland, and Jalen who kept their calm.</p>

  <p>They used almost all of their skills, trying to avoid the broken stones and the Lethal Fire Magma that was surging towards them.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated in the air and lifted the stone piece. He used it to block the Lethal Fire Magma that showered above his head.</p>

  <p>Turning over his body, he effortlessly kicked away a mountain-sized broken stone.</p>

  <p>He had already activated his strength to the limit and in turn, his muscles bulged. Growing to the size of the Wild God Body would be possible if it weren't for the limit of the space. It restricted him from doing so.</p>

  <p>But even if he tried his best, the scene he saw after kicking the stone away made his heart sink.</p>

  <p>He was fully concentrated on his own fight that he wasn't aware of what had been happening to his companions. The flows of Lethal Fire Magma formed a torrent and completely drowned everyone, including Leland and Jalen. They weren't even given the time to scream before they were covered by it.</p>

  <p>A sudden realization came as he was the only one left!</p>

  <p>"Why is this happening, then?"</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma had almost occupied every corner of the cave, so there was no chance to avoid it.</p>

  <p>He became alert as it was quickly rushing towards him. He activated a golden pattern on his chest!</p>

  <p>"Promise of Absolute Beginning!"</p>

  <p>The Promise of Absolute Beginning was the promise made after the divine land was created.</p>

  <p>He deducted that this promise should be made by Chiyou personally, which was used to block the attacks from any internal momentum in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Promise of Absolute Beginning was not invincible even if it was activated. It could not block the soul attacks or power attacks.</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma was not produced by internal momentum. He took the chance even though he was not sure whether it would work or not.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A burst of golden light enveloped his body.</p>

  <p>Right after, he was completely submerged in the Lethal Fire Magma!</p>

  <p>"It worked!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>The golden light that covered him had isolated and prevented the Lethal Fire Magma from making any damage to his body.</p>

  <p>But there was a time limit on the effect of the Promise of Absolute Beginning.</p>

  <p>It could only last for nine seconds after it was activated.</p>

  <p>Using the protection of the Promise of Absolute Beginning, he exerted himself to swim in the Lethal Fire Magma. He had to escape in a short time as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>Three seconds passed...</p>

  <p>Six seconds...</p>

  <p>Nine seconds...</p>

  <p>The time was already on the limit as the golden light around his body quickly dimmed. He tried squirming away from the Lethal Fire Magma but he felt that it was endless and was unable to break away from it.</p>

  <p>"The last Promise of Absolute Beginning!" he cried out as a last resort. He had already activated the Promise of Absolute Beginning once when he faced Edmond.</p>

  <p>Now he had activated the last one...</p>

  <p>This time, he had another chance and there were only nine seconds left for him!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struggled and continued to swim. The golden light shone brightly for the second time, enveloping his body.</p>

  <p>However, his attempt was once again futile. It felt as if he was swimming in the deep sea and couldn't move to the surface of the sea at all. The last nine seconds had already passed, and the golden light on his body finally disappeared.</p>

  <p>He was entirely enveloped by the Lethal Fire Magma!</p>

  <p>"I won't be lucky this time?" A bitter and complex feeling rose in Luo Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>He felt the burning sensation on his skin until he felt it deeper inside his body.</p>

  <p>He looked at his hands which had been quickly burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma burned him from outside to inside...</p>

  <p>It burned his skin, flesh, meridians, bones, viscera, and at last the inner world and the soul.</p>
