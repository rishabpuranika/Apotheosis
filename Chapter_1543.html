<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1543 Norton </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>She was pretty comfortable in her chair, feet propped up by a small stool as she read the silk book with relish. It was the latest novel of a popular series that she religiously followed.</p>

  <p>To say that she was a fan of popular novels was an understatement. As a Soul Sea Realm warrior, memorizing and retaining all the information in this silk book was very simple. All she would need to do was to use her full perception to engrave the words in her mind.</p>

  <p>But where was the fun in that? That was hardly a pleasurable way of reading.</p>

  <p>No, to make sure that she truly grasped the plot and fell in love with the characters, she needed to read these novels word for word. There was just this thrill of suspense in everyone's slowly unfolding fates page by page.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to get to the good part, a large mass of yellow Illusion Points flew into her room and towards her.</p>

  <p>The woman frowned as she absorbed the Illusion Points, "What happened?" she muttered in annoyance. It greatly displeased her to be disturbed at the most intriguing part of the story.</p>

  <p>"Who killed my man?! You will regret it!"</p>

  <p>She carefully folded the corner of the page, marking the part where she left off before carefully packing it into her Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>She then quickly left the comfort of her chair and headed outside. It was cold but her small, dainty footprints left a rather enchanting sight on the white powdery snow.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was quickly advancing along the city walls.</p>

  <p>He was right. The city lord did have more than one subordinate.</p>

  <p>All in all, she had a total of eight people who helped her collect Illusion Points at each city entrance.</p>

  <p>These eight people had been her personal bodyguards in the outside world.</p>

  <p>It was only natural that they remained her subordinates here. These eight guards were perfectly willing to hand over their accumulated points to her here in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>These warriors had a less than amicable reputation in the city. They were nicknamed 'butchers' due to their cruelty and often questionable methods of collecting Illusion Points from other warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng's speed meant it only took him a few minutes to reach the other side of the main city.</p>

  <p>There was a tall human warrior that stood in front of the city gate. He had an air of intimidation to him especially with the forbidding golden hammers he held in each hand.</p>

  <p>The warrior opened his mouth and projected his clear, loud voice, "Stand still! If you all cooperate then I'll be able to finish you with just one slam of my hammer. You won't feel any pain and the next thing you'll know, you've already been resurrected back in the city."</p>

  <p>There was a line of warriors in front of him getting ready to give half of their accumulated Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>Drawing a wisp of chaotic energy, he quickly summoned a strong wind that carried him forward. Combined with his already fast speed, he was a mere blur in the eyes of an ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>Just as this supposed gatekeeper was about to lift his hammer, he suddenly felt a powerful aura headed towards him. His eyes widened in surprise and a big smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"You're really looking for trouble! Come at me, you brat!"</p>

  <p>Norton, this tall gatekeeper declared with maddened frenzy. He was a very aggressive person and the Illusion Battlefield was the perfect place for him to let out all his pent-up rage to everyone.</p>

  <p>It was a pity he couldn't freely go around on a rampage because he had to help his master collect Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Norton wasn't really interested in being a gatekeeper and slaughtering these docile warriors. It was really just master's orders.</p>

  <p>But the appearance of a challenger invigorated him!</p>

  <p>Back when the Illusion Battlefield was just starting, there had been a lot of people who came to challenge him to fights.</p>

  <p>This quickly changed, however, when his expertise became known.</p>

  <p>There remained a few warriors stronger than him but all of them quickly became docile underlings after being taught a lesson or two by his master.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no pleasure in killing a docile lamb who willingly offered itself up for slaughter, which was why he was ecstatic by Zheng's sudden appearance.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>There was a loud, ringing noise as he struck his two hammers together aggressively.</p>

  <p>A visible wave burst forth from the hammers and the sound waves from the strike rang through everyone's ears and made their souls tremble.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Norton though, even Zheng felt a bit of an adrenaline rush upon seeing that his opponent was not afraid to face him.</p>

  <p>He only hoped that Norton wouldn't escape into the main city in the middle of the battle and use the golden pill. He wouldn't want his efforts to be in vain.</p>

  <p>'I have to kill him as fast as possible, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He quickly plotted his attacks as he rushed towards his opponent. When he was a mere hundred feet away, Zheng quickly hid into the void and got ready to close the distance with a single leap. His plan was to get close enough to deal the killing blow, giving his opponent no opportunity to launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng did this, he heard a loud snort from Norton who suddenly brandished his golden hammers and smashed them towards the void!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a loud booming crash as the hammers forced Zheng out of the void.</p>

  <p>He staggered back and could only look at Norton in surprise.</p>

  <p>Strangely, even Norton was shocked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current comprehension of the Space Law allowed him to hide in the void effectively which was perfect in avoiding his enemy's attention.</p>

  <p>However, Norton not only saw him use this skill but also managed to kick him out of the void with his hammers.</p>

  <p>The power of the hammers' strike caused his blood to churn inside him.</p>

  <p>He found himself needing to take a deep breath to counteract the effects of Norton's attack on his body.</p>

  <p>However, as mentioned before, Norton was just as equally shocked as Zheng.</p>

  <p>His hammers did reach and smash into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>But the force he released was enough to raze an entire mountain to the ground. A Soul Sea Realm warrior could never hope to survive that single strike from him. He expected Zheng to have turned into meat paste by now.</p>

  <p>So why was he still standing in front of him, dazed but still clearly unyielding?</p>

  <p>'Who the hell is this guy? How in the world did he survive my hammers?' Norton couldn't help but ask himself.</p>

  <p>A feeling quickly arose within him— it felt as if what he currently faced wasn't a mere human but a terrifying monster and he knew that his hammers would be no good against a monster.</p>

  <p>Even his master wouldn't be able to withstand a head-on strike from him, but this guy…</p>

  <p>However, unlike the blue-clothed warrior, Norton was not deterred.</p>

  <p>Instead, he became even more excited at the prospect of facing an extremely powerful opponent!</p>

  <p>These types of fights only came by chance. Besides, he couldn't really die here on the Illusion Battlefield. Fighting against such a strong warrior was so rare to him nowadays so he might as well take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>He was in desperate need of a good fight. He could collect the Illusion Points later after their match's conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I really envy your strong body. Too bad I'll be smashing it with my next attack. Don't be a coward and take it like a man!" Norton roared with blind fury.</p>

  <p>Clang! There was another loud ringing sound as Norton smashed his hammers together and released powerful waves in the air.</p>

  <p>As he did this, he quickly charged towards Zheng by moving his sturdy legs in a rather mysterious manner.</p>

  <p>As he charged, Norton waved his arms like crazy and formed numerous hammer shadows that served to protect him.</p>

  <p>His movements were so fast and erratic that not even Zheng was able to see through him.</p>

  <p>It was reminiscent of a mad bull that thought of nothing but death and destruction as he blasted through everything and everyone.</p>

  <p>Such display of fierceness quickly caught the attention of the other warriors who were initially waiting in line. Norton's hammers were intimidating but not so much when it wasn't being directed at them.</p>

  <p>"Oh man, that dude's going to get it. Norton's attacks can't be dodged!"</p>

  <p>"Norton's hammers will probably scare the shit out of him. Those things are enough to smash him into meat paste."</p>

  <p>"You know I heard something interesting. Once, when he got angry with the city lord, Norton smashed his hammers onto the walls and shook the entire city!"</p>

  <p>Of course, this was a gross exaggeration.</p>

  <p>All the main cities in the Illusion Battlefield were created by the heavens and were an incarnation of heavens' rules. It was impossible to shake their walls.</p>

  <p>Still, it was a nice embellishment to the tales of Norton's great strength.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng remained calm and collected, just as always. This strong opponent was only one of the many other strong opponents he had faced in his lifetime. The young man stood still on his spot but his power was currently circulating through his body and surging towards his arms. He looked up and locked gazes with an approaching Norton and his protective hammer shadows, ready for a fight!</p>
