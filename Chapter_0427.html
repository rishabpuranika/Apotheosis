<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Still feeling very upset, Tracy heard the referee announce, "Next Wing of Skytop Peak will fight the personal disciple, Patrick!"</p>

  <p>Making a face at Patrick, Tracy gestured at him. "Patrick, it's your turn!"</p>

  <p>After giving her a gentle smile in return, he made his way toward the battle ring.</p>

  <p>Among the personal disciples, Patrick seemed like a special one. Instead of the usual aggressive attitude the others showed, he always appeared friendly and seldom had any disputes with anyone.</p>

  <p>With this kind of behavior, it was difficult to know his true competence.</p>

  <p>Even so, it was common knowledge that he was rather capable since he ranked second in the Cloud Sect List.</p>

  <p>The one who ranked first in the list, Evan Li, was still practicing his cultivation in a secluded place so, in this round-robin, his name wasn't included in the draw lot box.</p>

  <p>If Evan didn't show up before the competition ended, then Patrick would be the most powerful participant in this session of the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>All the top ten disciples in the Cloud Sect List were very powerful.</p>

  <p>These talents improved remarkably fast in daily cultivation and none of them was overconfident about winning against each other if they had to battle.</p>

  <p>When it was Patrick's turn to compete, the personal disciples perked up and cheered because so far, the personal disciples' performance in the competition was uncharacteristically poor.</p>

  <p>In the former All Peaks Competitions, they had always been highly regarded so it would be a shame if none of them could turn the table for this one. Their previous achievements were nothing short of brilliant. In one of the former All Peaks Competitions, the top twenty spots were all filled in by personal disciples.</p>

  <p>This time, it seemed unlikely for them to achieve such success because many of the personal disciples had already been defeated by the disciples of the thirty-three peaks in the competition.</p>

  <p>Often condescending in attitude, the personal disciples were frustrated with the huge difference from previous competitions. One could imagine how frustrated they must have felt, so they were eager to find a leading personal disciple that could redeem them. Patrick was the most suitable person for the job.</p>

  <p>"Patrick, crack down that Wing guy!"</p>

  <p>"We believe in you! You'll win back honor for us personal disciples!"</p>

  <p>In the previous competitions, not a soul would have expected to hear such words come out of the crowd of personal disciples, as they seemed to be above such things.</p>

  <p>Because of how things were turning out, their attitudes seemed to shift.</p>

  <p>Never would they have expected to see so many powerful disciples among the thirty-three peaks.</p>

  <p>Patrick's opponent, Wing, stepped into the battle ring with a machete in his hand. Having won several rounds in a row, he looked rather refreshed. Looking at Patrick, he said, "I've been waiting for the battle between us for a long time."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Still maintaining his gentle and friendly demeanor, Patrick offered a smile.</p>

  <p>"Since Evan isn't here, I'll be glad to compete with you. If I win, all of the thirty-three peaks will see that the personal disciples are nothing special!"</p>

  <p>Although Wing was smiling, he wasn't doing it because he had Patrick's friendly nature.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, Wing had been defeated by several personal disciples in the competitions, driving him to practice cultivation hard since then.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time for him to redeem his dignity in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Seemingly agreeing with Wing, Patrick merely shrugged. "I don't think we're all that special either."</p>

  <p>With a shake of his head, Wing carelessly circled his machete in the air.</p>

  <p>"You personal disciples are just arrogant from the bottom of your hearts.</p>

  <p>Just because you said it doesn't mean you really think that way.</p>

  <p>But it doesn't matter! I will convince you completely!" Wing continued.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Patrick nodded once again and stretched out three of his fingers. "You're right. Maybe we are still a little arrogant deep down.</p>

  <p>This arrogance tells me I can defeat you with three moves."</p>

  <p>The crowd started reacting.</p>

  <p>"Three moves? I know Patrick is powerful but I don't think he can defeat Wing with just three moves. He must be boasting!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! Wing has just won several rounds against personal disciples in the competition, so they should be a matched pair. It's too early to tell who will win. I don't believe Patrick can defeat Wing in three moves."</p>

  <p>"Hmph! What's the big deal about being second on the list?</p>

  <p>To defeat Wing in three moves?</p>

  <p>How arrogant these personal disciples are! Patrick's asking to be humiliated if he can't defeat Wing in three moves!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the thirty-three peaks always challenged each other when they were in their own peaks and wouldn't dream of admitting they were less powerful than those of another peak. However, in the face of personal disciples, they would unite to fight against the outsiders.</p>

  <p>As he heard Patrick, Wing burst into laughter and snorted. "Well, since you're so confident about yourself, show me how incredible those three moves are!"</p>

  <p>With that, Wing gripped his machete and rushed toward Patrick.</p>

  <p>The machete Wing wielded was a high-grade spiritual weapon. However, it was rather special because of the two crystals embedded into the blade.</p>

  <p>Generally, a high-grade spiritual weapon embedded with a single crystal would be considered a low-grade fairy weapon. It was much more difficult to embed two crystals into the blade, so Wing's machete should be similar to that of a middle-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Powerful Machete, Triple Waves!"</p>

  <p>As Wing shouted out his attack, an aggressive Mu Ning radiated from him.</p>

  <p>With a sudden wave of his machete, three shots of sharp cutter energy rushed towards Patrick like waves of the sea. These "waves" could attack him thrice with each of the attack's impact dramatically increasing. The power of the first wave was terrifying enough, so one could imagine how incredible the doubled power of the second wave and the further doubled power of the third wave would be!</p>

  <p>According to the tier-4 cultivation method, "Heavenly Powerful Machete", practitioners could actually summon four or even five waves.</p>

  <p>Moreover, each additional wave did more than just double the previous attack power. Three waves would attack six times and four waves would attack ten times.</p>

  <p>With Wing's current capabilities, he could only summon three waves.</p>

  <p>Still, it was enough for him to defeat most of his opponents in the competition.</p>

  <p>In the face of such a strong attack, Patrick remained his calm smile without a hint of worry on his face.</p>

  <p>As the outrageous cutter energy came close, a shadow of a huge bell appeared from behind Patrick.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>When the three waves collided with the impenetrable defense formed by the bell, six clear and melodious sounds echoed in the battle ring.</p>

  <p>Everyone had life vitality to protect themselves, however, it took great skill and mastery to shape it the way Patrick had as he transformed his life vitality into an impenetrable defense. He might have been the only person able to transform his life vitality into an impenetrable defense.</p>

  <p>With that, he was able to fend off the attacks from powerful practitioners, such as Wing.</p>

  <p>"Since I used this impenetrable defense, one of my moves is considered done. I've got two left, now," Patrick said, still so composed for someone in the middle of a fight.</p>

  <p>Wing's face darkened as he saw that Patrick wasn't taking him seriously.</p>

  <p>Counting even the defense move when Patrick should only be counting attack moves showed that he believed he could easily beat Wing in only two moves. As the best disciple of Skytop Peak, Wing couldn't bear the humiliation.</p>

  <p>"Since you're talking so big, I'm going to force you to defend yourself!</p>

  <p>You'll shut up after three defenses!</p>

  <p>Heavenly Powerful Machete, Shattering Chop!"</p>

  <p>With that command, the machete in his hand immediately turned into hundreds of grey cutter shadows, almost enough to wrap around Patrick completely.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>A string of bell rings filled the arena once again. Patrick's defense was indeed impenetrable. "You've used your defense twice. Now, you only have one move left, right?" Wing asked deliberately.</p>

  <p>With a nod and a serious expression, Patrick simply answered, "Yes, I only have one move left."</p>

  <p>The fact had Wing arch an eyebrow and wave his machete back at Patrick once again. "Then show me how you can beat me with one move!"</p>

  <p>It was clear that Patrick couldn't defend against Wing's third attack. With only one move left, he could choose to either attack or defend.</p>

  <p>Wing's machete was destructive. Although he failed to break Patrick's impenetrable defense twice, if anyone else had dared to resist his machete, they would have been chopped to pieces by now.</p>

  <p>"Show me what you'll do!</p>

  <p>Heavenly Powerful Machete, Shura Chop!"</p>

  <p>For the third time, Wing shouted his move and waved his machete toward Patrick. The Shura Chop was the most powerful cutting method Wing had learned. Its blade intent was undoubtedly remarkable.</p>

  <p>Compared to sword intent, blade intent was blunter but more powerful.</p>

  <p>Like a powerful king with years of battle experience in the field, Wing waved his machete with a domineering Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Just then, Patrick used his last move? it was the only attack move he needed.</p>

  <p>"Samsara of Buddhism!"</p>
