<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was not until Zheng and Joy had departed that the respectful expression that Darrel and other True Gods had on their faces faded away.</p>

  <p>The several True Gods glanced at the bodies of the two top-rank True Gods, threw each other a concerned look, and then rushed over to their corpses.</p>

  <p>They had handed over all their wealth to these top-rank True Gods, and now they would certainly take their things back. Furthermore, they decided to make a profit out of these two top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The two top-rank True Gods had accumulated a great deal of wealth. If the True Gods were to rob them, they'd all become rich.</p>

  <p>Soon the belongings and the space rings on the two top-rank True Gods in black and white had all been emptied. Then all the things they had gathered were distributed by Darrel, the mid-rank True God and the leader of the group.</p>

  <p>"Where did the two low-rank True Gods come from? They didn't even care about the wealth these two top-rank True Gods had?" One of the low-rank True Gods said with a puzzled look.</p>

  <p>"Well, since they are able to kill these two top-rank True Gods with ease, then why should they care about such immaterial things? Didn't you see that the young man didn't even bother to make a move initially? He causally took out several hundred divine might coins to pass by. Didn't you see that?" Darrel sighed, "These two top-rank True Gods were quite ignorant to notice what was going on. I think the two low-rank True Gods were most likely from the Floating Islands."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean they were from those rich clans on the Floating Islands?" another low-rank True God asked with widened eyes.</p>

  <p>"But even a low-rank True God of some rich clan on the Floating Island wouldn't be able to kill these two top-rank True Gods so easily, right?"</p>

  <p>Another elder True God shook his head.</p>

  <p>To the vast majority of the True Gods in the divine land, the rich clans on the Floating Islands above the Time Sea were all legendary existences.</p>

  <p>The True Gods hailing from those rich clans were all elites.</p>

  <p>It was not strange for a low-rank True God to challenge a mid-rank True God. However, for a low-rank True God to kill a top-rank True God effortlessly, it was simply mind-boggling.</p>

  <p>On the border of the Non-combat Zone...</p>

  <p>"The Non-combat Zone will suppress warriors with the Truth of Godly Way of that skeleton. The higher one's cultivation is, the greater the suppression one would suffer. If I enter the Sword Clan, I will be discovered." Joy, who was hiding under her cloak, whispered, "I can only leave you here."</p>

  <p>The difficulty in suppressing a Holy Being and a True God was quite dissimilar.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly and said, "You can also participate in the debate over the Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>She shook her head slightly. "I have to help Bromley's two disciples.</p>

  <p>Your father tricked me again."</p>

  <p>At first, Zheng thought that Joy's involvement was a mere accident. But if one pondered carefully, then it could prove otherwise. It was perilous for Zheng to enter the Floating Islands in the first place, and Joy was the only person who could assist Zheng in escaping. Thus, her involvement perhaps was also a part of Mike's plan.</p>

  <p>Of course, Joy was happy to be involved.</p>

  <p>Now, Hallet wished to take control of the Swirl Forest, but he was wary that the Holy Beings would be alerted of his actions. According to the plan, Joy would return to the fairy palace and would temporarily take Yudie and the rest into her Purple Power World. Then she would continue to help Hallet and Augustus.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Zheng nodded. Then he turned around and crossed the boundary line of the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>The moment he crossed the boundary, an invisible aura enveloped him.</p>

  <p>After he went to the divine land, he found that the aura emitted by most of the True Gods was stable and lasting. After all, the lifespan of many True Gods could reach several divine eras, and in some cases, even dozens of divine eras. Their lifespan was far greater than that of the secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>When he felt the aura in this Non-combat Zone, he finally realized what eternity really was.</p>

  <p>The vicissitudes the aura contained were like an invisible arrow that started from the beginning of time and pointed all the way to the end of time. It felt as if all the forms of annihilation in the world could not destroy this aura.</p>

  <p>"Is this the aura from the skeleton? It's quite shocking."</p>

  <p>Just like all the True Gods who had stepped into this land before, the first time he felt this aura, he was in awe.</p>

  <p>Joy smiled at Zheng, who just stood there feeling the aura. She tightened her cloak and disappeared on the spot.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree Region that the Non-combat Zone covered was a large region in the divine land. Even for the True Gods, it was a vast place.</p>

  <p>After Zheng got used to the aura, he continued to move on under his cloak.</p>

  <p>The road Joy had chosen for him was quite remote and desolate. Along the way, he rarely saw any one. Occasionally, he met some True Gods, but they all lowered their gaze and rushed forward. They were very cautious, showing no intention of talking to him.</p>

  <p>After travelling for more than half a month, Zheng saw a huge shadow indistinctly appear in the bluish sky.</p>

  <p>The shadow looked like a giant beast with an enormous body. No one could tell where its body ended.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Sunrest Tree?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>He had heard that Sunrest Tree was not very tall, and it was the only tree of the four divine trees that had grown horizontally. Like the banyans, it would take root once with water and would continue to grow throughout the sea in the Sunrest Tree Region. It wouldn't stop expanding until the sea was completely covered by it.</p>

  <p>As he moved forward, he got closer and closer to the Sunset Tree, and the gigantic shadow started to appear distinctly in front of him.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the number of True Gods along the way was beginning to increase as well.</p>

  <p>Most of these True Gods traveled in groups of three or five.</p>

  <p>He even witnessed a group that had over a hundred people, all wearing similar clothes, and were marching forward in an organized way. They appeared to be trained disciples from some clan.</p>

  <p>After walking for more than a month, Zheng finally heard the sound of waves.</p>

  <p>It grew clearer as he moved closer to the tree.</p>

  <p>Then he saw the thick root of the Sunrest Tree in the distance. It resembled the feet of an enormous beast that lay on the sea. It formed a very wide pathway that extended to the shore.</p>

  <p>A towering divine city was built on the seashore. Inside the city, a slender building shot into the sky, like a giant sword that was pointed upwards. In addition to this, the buildings crisscrossed within the divine city were almost of the same design.</p>

  <p>Therefore, looking from a distance, it seemed as if there were countless swords inside the divine city. The scenery was breath-taking.</p>

  <p>"It lives up to the name of the Sword Clan." When Zheng saw the divine city, a smile appeared on his face. This city was a true depiction of how its people had endorsed the sword culture.</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>A few True Gods carrying a long sword on their backs suddenly knelt towards the divine city. They bowed down in the snow, wiped the snow off their bodies, then continued forward.</p>

  <p>After taking a few steps, they knelt again and kowtowed before they continued their journey.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree Region was a holy place of pilgrimage in the eyes of the True Gods who cultivated swordsmanship. Their devotion was not towards the Sunrest Tree, but rather towards the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>When Zheng arrived at the divine city, he witnessed a row of guards dressed in black and white standing at the city gate.</p>

  <p>They stood in a line, with a serious expression on their faces. An aura of awe-inspiring righteousness was emerging from them.</p>

  <p>If someone evil encountered them, they would feel extremely uncomfortable under the influence of such righteous aura.</p>

  <p>For most of the cities in the divine land, anyone who wanted to enter these cities needed to pay some divine might coins. However, this divine city did not have such a tradition. All the True Gods that came to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways only needed to present a piece of Sanskrit word to enter the city for free. If it was only a copy, it could work as well.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to acquire a copy of a Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"Hey, young man, do you have some Sanskrit words with you? You can't enter without Sanskrit words!" On the side of the road to the city gate, a mustached low-rank True God waved at Zheng. He took out a pile of white paper. The Sanskrit words on the paper were the copied version of the original text. They were even decorated with a layer of gold powder, glowing with a golden light. "One divine might coin for one piece,"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at them and then shook his head.</p>

  <p>The structure of those Sanskrit words was quite simple, and the information contained in them was insufficient. Thus, they weren't of much use.</p>

  <p>"How about two? One divine might coin and I'll give you two pieces."</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's lack of interest, the low-rank True God tried harder to make a sale. "These Sanskrit words are out-of-print versions. As long as you comprehend them, you will benefit a great deal from them!"</p>
