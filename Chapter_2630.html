<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Spark, what else you're worried about?" A bearded exile uttered, "We have all seen the means the Warden race set up. We are far more superior than them. I am sure even 10 Emilys would stand no chance against us!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Spark smiled faintly. "You're right, but don't forget that the girl and her brother are in the hands of Emily, and they know this place like the back of their hand. The Warden race could not be feeling really confident, otherwise why would they lure us here to fight them?"</p>

  <p>"You have a point there..." The bearded man nodded.</p>

  <p>The other exiles were also silent.</p>

  <p>Aside from Spark and the exiles from the Yellow Emperor race who belonged to the first tier, the twenty-plus exiles were slightly weaker.</p>

  <p>If they were to engage in direct combat with Emily, there was no doubt that these warriors would lose.</p>

  <p>In order to leave the world, they had no choice but to let themselves be used by the Warden race. The result of the battle was equally important to them.</p>

  <p>As Zelda led the way, Emily, Timotheus, and their group started picking up speed.</p>

  <p>There was no attractive scenery in this dark space. The grey color seemed to be designed to make people feel depressed and hopeless.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the exiles had strong minds, and all of them looked very calm.</p>

  <p>However, the elders of various races and the elite Wild Gods were all on edge. At the very slightest of sounds, they would become very vigilant.</p>

  <p>Long term vigilance would cause them to quickly get tired.</p>

  <p>Only Emily and the others who walked ahead leading the way could make them feel slightly relaxed.</p>

  <p>After they had walked for a hundred miles, they started hearing the faint sound of water. It sounded like ocean waves constantly rolling. Oddly enough, there was no water in sight at all.</p>

  <p>Hearing this odd noise, Zelda stopped immediately.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Emily asked as she stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"It's the Heavy Sea Water," said Zelda with a frown.</p>

  <p>"What is the Heavy Sea Water?" Emily asked.</p>

  <p>Just as Emily asked, a series of slender bubbles suddenly appeared on the ground in the distance, moving towards them at an alarming speed.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! They are manipulating the Heavy Sea Water to attack us!"</p>

  <p>Zelda couldn't keep up a calm facade and stepped back quickly.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The bubbles on the ground rapidly flew into the air, which turned out to be slender water arrows!</p>

  <p>At first, the water arrows didn't seem like much to worry about, but as they got closer, everyone could see clearly that each of them was about seven hundred thousand feet long and incomparably huge. Inside each of the arrows, the light blue water swirled violently, forming a sharp arrowhead, which contained a power that would scare anyone!</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Emily shouted.</p>

  <p>The others could retreat, but she could not.</p>

  <p>Facing those huge water arrows, Emily stretched out her hand and gently patted. A radiant wristband appeared on her arm.</p>

  <p>She shook the wristband lightly, and a curtain of colorful light, like an unfolded umbrella, manifested in front of her!</p>

  <p>"Puff..."</p>

  <p>The first water arrow hit the light curtain, and the light curtain gently swayed. Then, the water arrow spread out.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>Then, more water arrows hit the light curtain, generating a huge impact force.</p>

  <p>Emily raised her right hand high to steady the light curtain and said lightly, "Everyone, follow me and continue to move on!"</p>

  <p>These water arrows smashed into the colorful light curtain and kept on making loud explosions. Even Zheng was shocked when he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>With his current cultivation base, it was very difficult for him to block a water arrow. However, when Emily was in front of them, she managed to resist all the attacks...</p>

  <p>This woman was too powerful.</p>

  <p>Everyone gathered behind Emily and went on.</p>

  <p>However, these huge arrows kept hitting them relentlessly, with no signs of slowing down. As a result, their marching speed decreased too. The progress of the warriors was extremely slow.</p>

  <p>After moving slowly for one hour, they had only travelled about four miles. This space was not large, but at their current speed, it would take them a long time to navigate their way through.</p>

  <p>"We can't keep going on like this," Emily said with a frown. "Zelda, where did these arrows come from?"</p>

  <p>Zelda looked into the distance and said with a frown, "The Heavy Sea Water is being shot by the heavy water crossbow. I don't know who is controlling it, but they must have hidden somewhere to snipe us..."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Emily lowered her head and thought for a while. Then she looked at Timotheus and said, "Please do me a favor. Thank you."</p>

  <p>Timotheus immediately understood what she was referring to. He nodded slightly and said, "Ramzi, Leopold, come with me!"</p>

  <p>The three of them were the strongest among the exiles of the Nine Li race. In this situation, those other races had gone all out to attack them without showing any mercy.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the three of them rushed out of the light curtain and turned into three beams of light. They dexterously shuttled through the huge water arrows and soon disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>The others were still hiding behind Emily. Under the current circumstances, there was not much that they could do to help. They could only wait passively, including Zheng.</p>

  <p>After a while, there were suddenly several beams of bright light rising into the sky in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>The earth started shaking.</p>

  <p>A hint of worry flashed on the faces of several elders from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the three exiles of the Nine Li race were fighting with someone, most likely from the Warden race. It was natural for them to be worried about their safety, especially Adele.</p>

  <p>After all, her father was one of them.</p>

  <p>The intense roar lasted for a period of time before it quieted down, and the water arrows that were shot from afar also disappeared.</p>

  <p>Not long after, three beams of light flew over from afar. Everyone was relieved to see the three exiles of the Nine Li race return safely.</p>

  <p>Timotheus was in the lead, and he carried one man in his hand!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>After he arrived at the front of the crowd, he threw the man down casually, tossing him down in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>As the exiles looked down, confused expressions appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Is that Burt?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he Burt from the Four-image race?"</p>

  <p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>The Four-image race was a small race with its bloodline. In this race, there were only two exiles, one of whom was Burt. They all recognized the man lying in front of them immediately.</p>

  <p>Timotheus stared at the man and said, "Apart from him, those who released the water arrows just now also included one member from the Earth Fiend race, and one member from the Nine Eyes race. The two of them have been killed by me. It seems that these small races have entered this place before us."</p>

  <p>Emily frowned. "So, Spark is also here?"</p>

  <p>In her eyes, the exiles from those small races were not a big threat to her, but the strength of Spark still made Emily scared, especially when he was lurking somewhere to launch attacks.</p>
