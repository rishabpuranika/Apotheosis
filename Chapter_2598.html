<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2598 Draw The Bow </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden and unexpected change stunned everyone who saw.</p>

  <p>A series of attacks from David dazzled them and Luo Zheng was immediately cornered.</p>

  <p>He knew he had no place to hide.</p>

  <p>He moved his elixir field as soon as he could to create an invisible force.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword which wasn't completely solidified yet rushed towards David.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword landed on his body and prevented him from moving.</p>

  <p>As he saw an opening, Luo Zheng quickly distanced himself from David.</p>

  <p>"What the... He shaped it with his strength source? How did he do it so easily? He really is full of tricks I haven't seen before."</p>

  <p>Tyler was speechless. He didn't expect Luo Zheng to have so many tricks that were very unique and innovative.</p>

  <p>However, he had no intentions of letting Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to get rid of Luo Zheng who was more outstanding than David, he had to do it as soon as possible to make sure everything went as he planned.</p>

  <p>So he continued manipulating David to go all out on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under the constant pressure from David, all Luo Zheng could do was dodge his attacks.</p>

  <p>But it seemed that David was always one step ahead of Luo Zheng and was able to take full advantage of his speed. Occasionally, he would use the Truth of Void Destruction to launch a sneak attack in the void.</p>

  <p>While they were fighting, Luo Zheng moved as fast as he could because he knew he was in a dangerous situation.</p>

  <p>On the top of the Sky South Bone Tower not far from the Flying Sickle City, a huge eye was watching everything that was happening in the Flying Sickle City.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 didn't care about the ongoing fight between the Wild Gods at all.</p>

  <p>In their master's eyes, these creatures were nothing but puny insects.</p>

  <p>Even the exiles were just larger insects.</p>

  <p>The only person able to intrigue No. 9527 was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The brain masters asked No. 9527 to watch Luo Zheng closely and record his every move.</p>

  <p>If possible, they wanted it to get as close to him as possible.</p>

  <p>They knew that his own strength alone was not enough for helping himself cross the shore. He needed someone to guide him.</p>

  <p>"It's just a duel. Why does the exile intervene in it?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was confused because it usually had trouble understanding humans' intentions.</p>

  <p>Tyler had already mastered the Truth of Void Destruction perfectly, which meant that no one was able to notice that he was hiding in the void.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how powerful he was, he could not hide himself from No. 9527.</p>

  <p>The latter's eye could see through the void. It could see every single move Tyler made.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't usually intervene in ordinary duels. Taking advantage of such an opportunity, it was able to observe more carefully and meticulously.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had already shown that he had the ability to combine the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>This surprised No. 9527. It was able to feel the aura from the great unity.</p>

  <p>Though the aura wasn't much, it still took shape.</p>

  <p>Both of the master and the brain masters explained that the great unity ceased to exist because it was already extinct.</p>

  <p>All the creatures that were lucky enough to feel the aura of the great unity had transformed into Chaos Ancient Gods and become a part of this world.</p>

  <p>It was not going to work out the same way they expected.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were still a lot of creatures that dreamt of taking over the ultimate mystery in the chaos.</p>

  <p>If No. 9527 could approach Luo Zheng, it would definitely tell him not to take the same path.</p>

  <p>It could sense that the exile in the void had gone too far. When it noticed that Luo Zheng was in great danger, it became angrier and angrier.</p>

  <p>It was really shameless for an exile to bully a junior that gravely, the same way those gigantic brain masters bullied No. 9527.</p>

  <p>The brain masters already told No. 9527 to protect Luo Zheng as much as it could.</p>

  <p>At that thought, it decided to make full use of its given authority.</p>

  <p>The top of the Sky South Bone Tower began to tremble once again but the tower was so huge that no one was able to detect its movement.</p>

  <p>A new seed solidified beside the eye as the bone tower continued to tremble.</p>

  <p>The seed grew rapidly. Not long after, it blossomed and yielded a fruit.</p>

  <p>There was a tight bone bow inside the fruit.</p>

  <p>The bone bow was about three hundred feet wide and the arrow hanging on the bowstring was six hundred and twenty feet long.</p>

  <p>The top of the Sky South Bone Tower was about 873.6 billion miles away from the Flying Sickle City.</p>

  <p>It would take about 140 years for No. 9527 to successfully shoot the arrow into the Flying Sickle City with the help of the bowstring.</p>

  <p>But there were some hollow patterns on the arrow, which were created by a very small portion of the Truth of Void Destruction from No. 9527.</p>

  <p>However, even the smallest portion of the Truth of Void Destruction from a Chaos Ancient God was something beyond the exiles' imagination. If the arrow successfully passed through the void, it would definitely hit Tyler in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower of the Nine Li race...</p>

  <p>"I think there is something strange about David," Ramzi said worriedly.</p>

  <p>The exiles also observed Luo Zheng more closely.</p>

  <p>The oldest man began to hesitate. He had also sensed that there was something wrong with David but he couldn't place what it was.</p>

  <p>"Please save Luo Zheng right away. We have to admit our defeat in this battle. It is our best option. It's okay to give the Sky South Bone Tower to the Yellow Emperor race," said Leopold firmly.</p>

  <p>The oldest man frowned. "I refuse to let Luo Zheng die but if I make a move now, the Yellow Emperor race will surely make fun of us."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is more important than Luo Zheng's life right now," Ramzi continued.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the oldest man replied as he nodded his head. "We should wait a while. If Luo Zheng is unable to keep fighting, I will take him back immediately."</p>

  <p>Given the oldest man's power, it wouldn't be much trouble for him to get Luo Zheng back to the Sky Spirit Bone Tower in an instant.</p>

  <p>Although they had already noticed some hints that there was something wrong with David, they still failed to notice that Tyler was hiding in the void.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>The two sharp knives of David flew violently and immediately went for Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Under the control of Tyler, David was now much powerful than mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Even the elders were surprised to see his improvement, but Luo Zheng was still able to deflect his attack with his long sword.</p>

  <p>"You are starting to get into my nerves."</p>

  <p>Tyler was getting a bit angry. After thinking about it for a while, he continued to control his puppet David. His attack became more and more ferocious after every strike.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried his best to calm down and deal with the enemy without losing his cool.</p>

  <p>However, the gap between him and Tyler was so enormous that it couldn't be ignored. Under the endless suppression from David, Luo Zheng finally showed a flaw.</p>

  <p>David then focused all his attacks on this flaw.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>A clear sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's legs were cut by the two sharp knives and he could no longer stand firmly. His long sword was suddenly thrown into the air before piercing the ground tens of thousands of feet away from them. It then shrank down to only several feet long.</p>

  <p>David's eyes went totally blank as he slowly walked towards Luo Zheng, gripping his two sharp knives tightly.</p>

  <p>"It's time to finally put an end to this fight," said David in a strange tone.</p>

  <p id="top_17">At the same time, No. 9527's consciousness appeared at the top of the Sky South Bone Tower. "You lose."</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the bow was drawn.</p>
