  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had stayed in Misty Mountain Village for more than half a month.</p>

  <p>The people there were simple and hospitable. They were more than kind enough to provide Luo Luo Zheng with delicious food and a place to stay. As he witnessed how cruelly the villagers were killed, Luo Luo Zheng immediately felt unparalleled wrath in his heart. However, the anger instantly disappeared from his eyes. As a mature warrior, he was able to suppress the emotions in his heart at any time.</p>

  <p>Most of the villagers fled helplessly in panic, but there were still some brave villagers who stepped forward with spears in their hands.</p>

  <p>However, they were pitifully weak despite their valor. They also knew they were no match for their opponents. As their arms shook with terror, they hoped for at least an honorable death.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>A cyan saber light flashed, and the long spears in the hands of those villagers suddenly broke into two pieces. The villagers became engulfed with despair as their weapons became useless. The warrior in the lead had a cold smile on his face. He raised the cyan saber in his hand again and was about to chop off the head of a villager.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng descended from the top of the house. Before he landed, he gave the ground an elbow strike. His powerful display immediately caught the attention of the invaders. As his body spun in a circle, the wooden sword in his hand pointed out.</p>

  <p>The wooden sword weighed more than ten thousand pounds, while the cyan long saber in the Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's hand weighed more than a hundred thousand pounds. Since Luo Luo Zheng couldn't activate his cinnabar field, he naturally could not infuse his chaotic energy into the wooden sword. As such, the wooden sword he held would naturally be inferior to the long sabers of the enemies.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng had predicted, the cultivation methods of ordinary warriors were too weak. Even if the enemy warriors were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, their sword skills were still too horrible to look at. Luo Luo Zheng simply had an advantage in experience and knowledge.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's wooden sword, like a spirit serpent that had climbed out of the cave, pressed on his opponent's wrist. With his nimble footwork, he quickly gained an advantageous position against the enemy.</p>

  <p>Although he only used the power of his body, it was still enough to make the Spirit Supreme Realm warrior suffer. The moment the wooden sword pressed on the wrist of the enemy warrior, a bone was immediately heard to snap. The cyan long saber in the warrior's hand fell to the ground with a clang. The warrior covered his wrist and howled. A painful expression was immediately reflected in the warrior's face. His wrist bone had been smashed!</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors were too weak. With his level of martial arts, he could easily toy with them.</p>

  <p>In the universe, not to mention the warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm, even those at the Life and Death Realm and the Soul Sea Realm wouldn't change the expressions on their faces if one of their wrists was broken.</p>

  <p>Even if one of their arms was cut off, they would still be able to calmly face the enemy. However, the warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm immediately lost his focus and howled painfully after a single bone snapped.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng thought of this, he continued to sprint forward. Without any hesitation, he bombarded the enemies with magnificent swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The other Spirit Supreme Realm warriors only saw Luo Zheng's shadow flash as he attacked towards them. Even with their exceptional perception, Luo Luo Zheng eluded their eyes. They brandished their sabers and tried to meet Luo Luo Zheng head-on. However, with their weak skills, how could they hit Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like a nimble deer as he continuously dodged the rough blades.</p>

  <p>Whenever he saw an opportunity, he would immediately thrust his sword against an enemy. Every time Luo Luo Zheng pointed out his sword, it would accurately press on the wrist of the opponent. After a bone was heard to crack, a large cyan saber also fell to the ground with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a sound of anguish would be heard from the victim of Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, the seven Spirit Supreme Realm warriors gave out shrill cries of anguish. Their expressions were full of pain and humiliation. As they suffered intense agony, all they could do was cover their damaged wrists.</p>

  <p>When the villagers of Misty Mountain Village saw the scene, all of them were stunned. Woolley and his group could only gawk as they witnessed Luo Zheng's true skills. They had just rushed over but the battle had already ended.</p>

  <p>"Woolley, is my master really a proving godly warrior?" Thomson asked softly as his face was filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Thomson had never seen the strength of proving godly warriors before.</p>

  <p>Due to the remoteness of their village, he had only heard of it from his brother. However, it seemed that they weren't as powerful as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I, I'm not sure either." Woolley's heart pounded relentlessly. He originally couldn't tell Luo Zheng's cultivation level, but as far as he knew, a proving godly warrior couldn't defeat seven Spirit Supreme Realm warriors in such a short time. However, Luo Luo Zheng had easily defeated not just one, but all seven of them. Was Luo Luo Zheng already a True God? But he didn't have the unique Mu Ning of a True God.</p>

  <p>"Brat, who are you? How dare you do this? We are from the Sun Moon Village. Our leader..." The head of the group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors covered his arm and stared at Luo Luo Zheng fiercely. Surely, he had discovered that Luo Luo Zheng was a proving godly warrior. Therefore, he wanted to scare Luo Luo Zheng away. He immediately mentioned the village they were from to incite fear in Luo Luo Zheng. A small village like Misty Mountain Village would not have a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>However, before the enemy warrior could finish his words, Luo Luo Zheng lifted his foot. Instantly, a stone flew towards the enemy warrior. The stone heavily smashed into the warrior's jaw and crushed it into pieces. The warrior couldn't even scream, let alone speak.</p>
