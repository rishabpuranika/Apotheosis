</p>

  <p>Margaret walked in, or rather, flew into the room with a faint smile on her face. She asked the old man in a sweet tone, "Sir, may I offer you a cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled at the softness of her tone and nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>The kind and considerate Elder Apeiron was the wife of this old man, and she had just become Elder Apeiron's disciple the previous night, so it was only right that she now treated the old man in front of her with great respect. However, she was currently unwilling to let Zheng find out that she was trying to improve herself in cultivation.</p>

  <p>Smiling upon the consent she had received, Margaret sifted a pot of green tea before brewing a cup and handing it over to the old man, who accepted with an ecstatic expression on his face.</p>

  <p>He was very happy to have found this girl. Laughing loudly, he showed his happiness, "That's a good girl! No one among my disciples is so courteous like you!"</p>

  <p>He was sure that his wife must be very grateful to him for introducing such a talented disciple to her. And now, upon discovering what a sweet and good mannered girl she was, he felt even more pleased with his discovery. However, since he was able to read her mind, he also understood the bitterness she had borne in mind at the wedding ceremony the day before. It was his pity for the lovesick girl that had made him praise her to the skies in front of Zheng, whether the effort bore fruit or not.</p>

  <p>Margaret smiled with gratitude as she prepared another cup of tea. She handed it over steadily to Zheng and then retreated to one side, giving the two men some room to talk.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had taken a small sip of his tea, he turned to the old man and began to thank him, "I am really grateful for the gift you gave me yesterday. I..."</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could finish his sentence, the old man waved the gratitude off and directly continued with his own agenda, "Max and the others have returned to the Celestial Position race. The pill that I gave you is nothing impressive. It will merely help you cultivate a little faster.</p>

  <p>As for that man who was sent there by the Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, I have already asked him to leave! I don't have a name, so you don't need to ask me about it..."</p>

  <p>Clearly, he was the sort of person who was least bothered about polite and traditional conversation starters.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mouth was still wide open for having been interrupted.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, before he could ask a single question, the old man had already told him everything he wanted to know. In fact, it was his straightforward way of speaking which had rendered Zheng speechless.</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled and drained the cup of tea in his hand in one gulp.</p>

  <p>He then turned his head towards Margaret and asked, "Little girl, please pour me another cup of tea!"</p>

  <p>Margaret walked up to him and filled the porcelain teacup before retreating to the side once again.</p>

  <p>Even after that, Zheng didn't have an opportunity to speak as the old man continued himself, "Since you don't have a destined fate, our Celestial Position race won't be able to control your future. Therefore, I am not going to bring you back to the race."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng was surprised.</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled, "Do you feel disgruntled about that? In any case, it has been already determined. Although some old men almost fought with me over this matter, I was right after all! You are free to ascend on your own. Our race will not interfere with your path or your journey in this world and beyond."</p>

  <p>Zheng was even more confused now. He thought for a moment and decided to ask about the Tower of Crystal. Max and the others had discussed the matter with him and decided that the Tower of Crystal should remain in the Sea God Continent for at least three more centuries.</p>

  <p>Once more, before he could even utter a single word of the question, the old man answered it, "We'll just leave the Tower of Crystal here for now.</p>

  <p>It's not going to be of much use for us, anyway."</p>

  <p>Zheng was flabbergasted. He had never seen anyone forestalling their partner in a conversation like this before. Even before the questions were uttered, this old man would answer them all. Zheng had to remain silent the entire length of their discussion.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Margaret was quite amused and started to snigger in the corner. She had never seen Zheng so embarrassed before.</p>

  <p>Zheng then began to think about the reason why the old man wasn't going to bring him to the race, but just as he moved his lips, he immediately shut them again. He was sure that the old man wouldn't let him ask it anyway.</p>

  <p>As he expected, the old man piped up, "There's no reason for that at all!</p>

  <p>I've thought about it a lot. Anyone without a destined fate has to choose his or her own path. You possess the talent and the strength to lead the world of chaos, and yet, you are not destined for it. You will have to make a decision on your own. Nobody should interfere with your fortune or your future..."</p>

  <p>Zheng took another sip of his tea in silence. Yolande had said similar words to him just some time ago.</p>

  <p>She was ready to fight the Celestial Position race for keeping Klein on her side. Klein was the one who had received the silver Asura title.</p>

  <p>However, she had said that she wouldn't interfere a single bit with Zheng's matters. In fact, even after he had obtained the Heavenly Fragment in the past, she hadn't had any reactions and had just let Zheng make the decision by himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng was indeed completely free to choose his path. But one little doubt was still nagging him. He felt that he still needed someone to point him in the right direction. He was conflicted.</p>
