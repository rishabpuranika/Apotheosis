<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air on the Floating Islands became subtle and solemn after the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>Not many True Gods witnessed Nicholas's angry face in person. But the things that happened on Astronomical Transit Day were quickly spread among the various Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"The anonymous man's identity was finally revealed. It's Mike's son!"</p>

  <p>"It's quite bold of him to come here. He even bypassed the Jiang Clan's supervision, and directly came to the divine land!"</p>

  <p>"What's more, he took away the jade seal from the hands of many consummate True Gods. It's said that the jade seal is a fourth-grade supreme treasure of belief."</p>

  <p>"Is there something going on between him and Estelle? She silenced the whole divine land for him."</p>

  <p>"Not to mention that the lives of those consummate True Gods are at his disposal, and he's just a low-rank True God. That's quite impressive!"</p>

  <p>Most of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands had a stable relationship.</p>

  <p>The numerous True Gods worked hard day and night, shuttling back and forth in the forbidden lands and the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The news of the incident quickly spread through the rest of the Floating Islands like wildfire, because not only it involved Zheng, but the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan was caught up in it as well.</p>

  <p>Thus, things were really on edge. Everyone was curious as to how Nicholas would react, and how the Han Clan would deal with the matter, and whether the consummate True Gods which were taken by Zheng, would return safely or not.</p>

  <p>If Zheng really killed those True Gods, then things were about to go south.</p>

  <p>A while later, Rachelle, Troy, Alfredo and others finally came back.</p>

  <p>As soon as Alfredo stepped foot on the Han Clan's Floating Island, he was summoned by the Holy Emperor.</p>

  <p>The next day, after the three girls of the Han Clan had walked into the main hall of the Purple Soul Hall, the female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall entered the wide hall as well.</p>

  <p>The disciples were also aware of rumors that were going around.</p>

  <p>Initially, they didn't quite believe that the rumors were true, but after they heard certain undeniable things, and when they noticed that Joy was gone, they concluded that Joy had run away with Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Joy was the sole reason the Purple Soul Hall existed, and her being a Demi-holy Being strengthened the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Since Joy had offended Nicholas, it was a mere dream for her to return to the Floating Island. The disciples of the Purple Soul Hall were uncertain of their future and lived in great fear.</p>

  <p>In a long velvet dress, Liusu looked blankly at the door of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey appeared distraught. They both clutched Liusu's hands tightly.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the disciples were all gathered.</p>

  <p>A while later, Alfredo appeared on the highest throne of the Purple Soul Hall and announced in a calm voice, "Since the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan betrayed the clan, all thirty thousand of her disciples are also being regarded as traitors. As of today, the Purple Soul Hall has been dissolved and is being incorporated into the Holy Emperor City. All the female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall are expelled from the Floating Island. They must leave immediately."</p>

  <p>The female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall remained silent when they heard the shocking news.</p>

  <p>Alfredo gave them a cold look and then disappeared.</p>

  <p>After his departure, a sob was heard in the hall, followed by the cry of other female disciples. Soon, tens of thousands of the female disciples broke down, crying.</p>

  <p>Mae, who was among the crowd, looked sad. Her heart was full of guilt and remorse.</p>

  <p>If she hadn't brought Tianxing to the Floating Island, nothing would have happened, and Joy wouldn't have left.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, with or without Tianxing, the Purple Soul Hall still would have been dissolved.</p>

  <p>She clenched her fists as her eyes burned with rage.</p>

  <p>"Our master didn't betray the Han Clan!"</p>

  <p>Madam Moon in the corner shouted in a piercing voice.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, she didn't!"</p>

  <p>"How could she possibly be unfaithful to the Han Clan? I mean, she's the Demi-holy Being of the clan!"</p>

  <p>"Even if they want us to leave, they can't slander our master like that!"</p>

  <p>Some female disciples were quite angry, yet they couldn't find a target on whom they could vent their anger. Finally, they locked their eyes on Liusu.</p>

  <p>Since the three sisters were from the direct line of the Han Clan, they ultimately became the disciples' target.</p>

  <p>Looking at their enraged faces, Liusu raised her hand, demanding them to calm down, but her efforts were in vain. Some female disciples were so furious that they even started insulting Liusu and her family.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the situation was slipping out of Liusu's hands, Madam Moon said loudly, "Everyone, be quiet. Let's see what the princess has to say!"</p>

  <p>Although everyone in the Purple Soul Hall was afraid of Madam Moon, they knew that her loyalties lay with the Purple Soul Hall and Joy. Thus, they settled down.</p>

  <p>When the hall quieted down, Liusu said gently, "You are right, Joy didn't betray us."</p>

  <p>All the female disciples were shocked to hear this.</p>

  <p>"Rather, the Han Clan has betrayed her," continued Liusu in a low voice.</p>

  <p>If the Han Clan really had any pride or nerve, it would have fought Nicholas with all its might.</p>

  <p>However, her father's obsequiousness towards the Dongfang Clan had let Liusu down thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"Such a clan doesn't deserve disciples like you. Since you are all expelled, I'll go with you as well!" Liusu went on.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey weren't sure what was happening, as they listened to Liusu.</p>

  <p>All of them were the direct children of the Han Clan. How could they just leave?</p>

  <p>The female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall were in awe.</p>

  <p>As the princess, and one of the strongest talents of the Han Clan, would she willingly abandon her clan?</p>

  <p>Liusu had this idea the moment she saw Joy escape with Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had kept it to herself until today.</p>

  <p>"Sister..."</p>

  <p>"Liusu..."</p>

  <p>Kelsey and Aleyna looked at her in pure astonishment.</p>

  <p>After the Purple Soul Hall was dismissed, all the female disciples packed up and left.</p>

  <p>Liusu did the deeds.</p>

  <p>Aleyna, Kelsey, and Liusu also disguised themselves, attempting to sneak out of the Floating Island with the rest of the female disciples.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, before they could leave the Floating Island, they were intercepted by the people of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>They were prohibited to leave the island and were strictly guarded all the time.</p>

  <p>In the side hall of the fairy palace, the hemline of Joy's light purple dress fluttered even when there was no wind.</p>

  <p>She recited the words repetitively.</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, she could imprint these ten thousand words in her mind at a glance, but when the next thought came to her, the words in her mind would vanish, and she couldn't remember them anymore.</p>

  <p>If she wanted to memorize the Truth of Godly Way, she could only utter the words one by one, and as long as she could hang on for more words, she could retain more of them.</p>

  <p>It was not easy even for a Demi-holy Being to completely learn the Truth of Godly Way in a short time.</p>

  <p>On the first day, she could recite only 1, 700 words.</p>

  <p>The next day, she could enumerate 3, 200 words.</p>

  <p>Things became more complicated as she went on.</p>

  <p>The more words she accumulated, the more difficult it was for her to recite.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to recite the words, but rather to comprehend the true meaning of the mind method.</p>

  <p>In the void sea, at the end of the Godly Ways, the Truth of Godly Way was like a small boat that would lead her to the other shore. The process of understanding the Truth of Godly Way was the process of climbing onto that boat.</p>

  <p>By the fifteenth day, she was able to recite about 4, 700 words in one go, almost half of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>After she finished reading the words, her eyes sparkled with excitement and her face beamed with delight.</p>

  <p>She felt as if she had caught a slight opportunity, got the key point, and held one side of the boat.</p>
