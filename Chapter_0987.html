<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 987 Kill Three With One Strike </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>When the warrior from the Shen Clan, who was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, heard this, his expression instantly changed.</p>

  <p>Whenever Tianming used his sword, someone would surely be killed. He didn't dare to fight against Tianming as it was simply courting death.</p>

  <p>Every warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm cared about his own life.</p>

  <p>While it was true that these clans were joining hands this time to work with Emanuel to fight against Ning Yudie, it was also known that they were only doing it for their own interests. If Emanuel were to become the new leader of the Cloud Hall, all of them would reap some kind of special benefit.</p>

  <p>But still, the whole thing was not worth it for them if they had to pay the price with their own lives.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going. You can go if you want to," the warrior from the Shen Clan said, shaking his head fervently.</p>

  <p>Emanuel gritted his teeth and said coldly, "If you are all afraid of death, how will we barge into the Ice Palace?"</p>

  <p>All of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm looked at each other in silence. A few moments passed until someone said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid of death? Go first if you are not!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Emanuel, you can go first! If you are the first one to charge, then we will be right behind you!"</p>

  <p>"As long as you take the lead, there's no way we wouldn't follow you!"</p>

  <p>As they shouted their sentiments, Emanuel became increasingly angrier.</p>

  <p>'If I take the lead, I'll be killed by Tianming, ' he thought to himself, looking around at the now impassioned warriors. 'Then the leader of the Cloud Hall won't belong to the Zhuo Clan. It will belong to the Shen Clan, Fei Clan or Wu Clan. I'm not that stupid!' he cursed inwardly.</p>

  <p>"Dad, I'll go!"</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was Frank's elder brother and Emanuel's eldest son, Finlay.</p>

  <p>"You?" Emanuel said, stunned for a moment. Then, he suddenly smirked and shook his head, saying, "You are no match for Tianming."</p>

  <p>Finlay was only at the Internal Elixir Realm. Even if he was willing to go first, Tianming would not attack him as there was no need to do so. Saint Morphens could kill Finlay as easily as a single stab. There was no reason for Emanuel to send his son to his death.</p>

  <p>"If none of you are willing to go now, that bitch will reach the Life and Death Realm. Do you know what the consequences will be?" Emanuel asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Everyone suddenly became quiet, as if stunned by the question. From ancient times, those who tried to rebel but failed had come upon nothing good. Not only would they suffer, their clans would also be severely punished. Although it was impossible for Cloud Hall to wipe out these third-grade clans, still the punishment they were going to face was not something they could take easily.</p>

  <p>"Then... How about we attack together?"</p>

  <p>Finally, the warriors cheered in agreement, vicious expressions appearing on their faces. They were really going all out this time as there was no other way out for them. They had been stuck here for so long just because they didn't want to be the first one to be killed.</p>

  <p>Emanuel nodded and said, "Alright. We've delayed for far too long now.</p>

  <p>If all of us attack together, we'll definitely be able to take down the Ice Palace and kill that evil bitch!"</p>

  <p>He had been planning this for more than a day or two now. This was the opportunity he had waited for so long, and so when it showed itself, he quickly and firmly grasped it.</p>

  <p>"Cloud Hall belongs to our clans, not to Ning Yudie Ning!"</p>

  <p>"Our victory or downfall will be decided in one move!"</p>

  <p>"No. We will definitely win! Saint Morphens cannot stop us!"</p>

  <p>As long as this group of warriors charged forward together, at most, only one of them would be killed by Tianming. Everything would become settled once Saint Morphens was dealt with. The remaining elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were nothing to fear. Although the juniors at the Internal Elixir Realm were fearless, their cultivation levels were still far too low.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After the discussion was over, Emanuel and the others finally decided to act on their plan and started rushing up to the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Tianming was still on the platform in front of the Ice Palace, unmoving, his eyes closed as blood kept flowing out from them. He looked extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>"They're coming," Patrick whispered in Tianming's ear. His face darkened as he relayed this warning to Tianming, who was sitting beside him.</p>

  <p>"I know." Tianming took out the long sword from his space ring and gripped it tightly. Although his Heavenly Sword was powerful, it could only be used in a single strike, and after that, he must recharge his energy. Obviously, he could only strike once as Emanuel and his companions would not give him a second chance.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Tianming was hesitant about who he should kill with this sword strike. How he would achieve the maximum effect with a single sword strike was the huge predicament he was having at the moment.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens and the other elders also stood at his side, their expressions abnormally solemn. They were well aware that their chances of victory were very small, close to zero. Despite the bitter truth, they still chose to defend Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Those standing here, in front of the Ice Palace, were people who had sworn their lives to follow Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Since everyone had chosen to stand here, they had already decided to sacrifice their lives if needed.</p>

  <p>"Pull out your weapons!"</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>On the platform, everyone was ready for the upcoming battle.</p>

  <p>A murderous intent permeated the air as the distance between the two opposing groups continued to close. At this moment, Tianming suddenly made his move.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed like Tianming was sitting on the ground, he was actually floating two inches away from it. At this moment, he was constantly gliding along the ground, adjusting his position.</p>

  <p>When Tianming moved, the expressions of Emanuel and the other warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm changed. If Tianming were to strike, there was no doubt that someone was going to die. As for who, that would solely depend on Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Charge over and stop him from thrusting!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm rushed towards Tianming at an extremely fast speed. At this time, Saint Morphens and the other warriors were also charging forward to stop them.</p>

  <p>After Tianming adjusted his angle, his eyes that were bleeding profusely suddenly opened!</p>

  <p>Two sword shadows appeared in his eyes. They brewed in his dark, deep eyes, causing his eyes to become abnormally sharp. If anyone were to look him in the eye, that person would feel as if his eyes were being pierced by needles, and it would be unbearable!</p>

  <p>Tianming, who had opened his eyes, abruptly brandished his sword.</p>

  <p>"Disperse!"</p>

  <p>When Emanuel saw Tianming facing him, he was immediately scared out of his wits. For a long time now, he had dreamed and imagined himself as the person who would rule Cloud Hall. If he were to be assassinated by Tianming right now, he would truly be the unluckiest guy in the whole entire world. He couldn't accept any of that.</p>

  <p>Just as Emanuel was dodging the upcoming strike with all his might, Tianming's sword struck out.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a strange Mu Ning radiated from Tianming's eyes. This Mu Ning was both majestic and energetic. People who stood in front of him would feel like they were so insignificant.</p>

  <p>This feeling usually appeared when a warrior was alone, looking up at the sky.</p>

  <p>Tianming had accumulated the power of the heavens and he chose to let it out at this moment. Everyone immediately felt as if the world had been turned upside down. Tianming was representing the heavens and everything else in the world.</p>

  <p>Even though everyone knew that this was an illusion created by Tianming after he struck out with his sword, their minds were still affected by his imposing Mu Ning, causing them to fail to think clearly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>An extremely sharp sword radiance shot out.</p>

  <p>The speed of the sword radiance was so fast that there was no time for anyone to dodge. Everyone only saw a flash of light before they heard three distinct sounds ringing in their ears.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>They were the sounds of flesh being pierced by the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>At that moment, time seemed to stop. Regardless of whether it was Saint Morphens or Emanuel, everyone stood still, frozen in their spots.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned, and none of them dared to breathe.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the bodies of three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm swayed. Their eyes were filled with unwillingness and anger.</p>

  <p>"Wh-why me?"</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>With a thrust of his sword, Tianming killed three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Despite Tianming being only at the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, the Heavenly Sword that he cultivated was so strong! It stunned everyone! Even Luo Luo Zheng could not do this when he had just become a war lord.</p>

  <p>"Lucas!"</p>

  <p>"Elijah!"</p>

  <p>A few angry roars came from Emanuel's side.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Emanuel let out a long sigh. Luckily, Tianming's sword was not aimed at him. Otherwise, he would be a corpse on the ground by now.</p>

  <p>"Charge! Kill that brat!"</p>

  <p>Emanuel gritted his teeth and shouted.</p>

  <p>The remaining warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were enraged.</p>

  <p>They were all warriors from third-grade clans, and those three warriors who had just been killed were their own brothers. How could they not be angry at this moment?</p>

  <p>The key point was that Tianming needed a long time to gather his energy after a strike. After that, he would only be an ordinary warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm and would be of no threat to any warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>This was the right time for them to launch their attacks.</p>
