</p>

  <p>Some talented cultivators would choose not to boost their progress. On the contrary, they would suppress their level until it could not be suppressed and then they could make a natural breakthrough in their current level!</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's level was improving very slowly, a major reason was that he had not taken any well-refined pill. So far, he was at the second grade of the nature level, but his foundation was far more stable and solid than other cultivators.</p>

  <p>However, after the All Peaks Competition, Luo Zheng had a subtle feeling that he was about to make a breakthrough, and this feeling was growing stronger and could not be suppressed anymore.</p>

  <p>After three days of practice in the secret room, Luo Zheng left with improved strength. He had now reached the third grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>During these three days, Luo Zheng was busy practicing and comprehending.</p>

  <p>As a result, he felt that with the blink of an eye, these three days had slipped away. Not only had he made a breakthrough in his level, but he had also acquired a certain understanding about the killing Mu Ning, or the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After establishing a connection with the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Zheng had researched on the fundamentals of the malicious Mu Ning, and he found that the malicious Mu Ning was actually a kind of strange energy.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Zheng felt that the malicious Mu Ning was a destructive force. After all, killing and slaughtering other living creatures was a catastrophe for them.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng quickly overturned the idea after he took advantage of the malicious Mu Ning that came out of his sword spirit, Lily. He studied the Mu Ning and tried to find answers to his questions.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning was quite different from a destructive force— it was actually a life force.</p>

  <p>When any creature was being slaughtered, it would be very reluctant, angry, and sad. It would curse the beast that killed it so that the beast wouldn't have a peaceful and natural death. Then, the creature would die with deep resentment.</p>

  <p>And a malicious Mu Ning was formed in such a situation. As a matter of fact, it was a kind of cursing force reserved by a dying creature at the last moment of its life.</p>

  <p>Even if a creature was rather small, such as an ant, it could still curse before its death. But the ant might not have a mind of its own as it worked for the queen ant all its life. And so, how could it send out the power of a curse?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not understand about that. So he concluded that it was due to the miracle of the Creator!</p>

  <p>But ants were so small and weak that the force of their curse could be almost negligible. The stronger the creature was, the more powerful its life energy would be, and the more powerful its curse would be!</p>

  <p>The force of these curses was attached to the body of the killer, and as time went by, it gradually formed the malicious Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>Because a malicious Mu Ning was originally the cursing power released by a living creature that was unwilling to die but was killed, it was regarded as something harmful.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there were so many geniuses in this world. At some point, a genius invented the method of using a malicious Mu Ning to transform what was originally harmful to his body into his way of attack! Malicious auras contained life force, and naturally, they were very powerful. Yet, as the saying goes, every coin has two sides. Despite the power, malicious auras also had terrible effects. The greater the number of creatures killed, the larger the number of malicious auras earned by a cultivator. In the process, the disciple who practiced this kind of cultivation method might be inadvertently attacked and controlled by the malicious Mu Ning in his body. As a result, he would become mad.</p>

  <p>But for Luo Zheng, the negative effect of a malicious Mu Ning was not a problem.</p>

  <p>He had connected with the Killing Sword Mountain, where he could deposit and withdraw malicious auras as he wished.</p>

  <p>The only problem for him was that he was not a bloodthirsty killer and he had no source of malicious auras. The more malicious auras he consumed, the fewer it would become.</p>

  <p>The problem could only be solved later as he hadn't found any feasible solution so far.</p>

  <p>Currently, he had to focus on his last competition. The area around the battle ring of the All Peaks Competition was now filled with more people than any competition before.</p>

  <p>Because the previous competitions were over and this was the final match between Luo Zheng and Patrick, the highlight and championship event of the All Peaks Competition, the disciples of Cloud Sect, whether inner or outer disciples, were no longer restricted to watching the match on site.</p>

  <p>The senior leaders of Cloud Sect had made a rule that each disciple who wanted to watch the match on site needed to pay one point for the entrance fee. After all, a large organization like Cloud Sect would not want to lose such a brilliant business opportunity.</p>

  <p>A point was not a significant cost for inner disciples. Even for the common disciples who were promoted as inner disciples, they could more or less complete some tasks to earn some points. What was more, some of the inner disciples who did not qualify to participate in the All Peaks Competition would be happy to enter the arena at the cost of one point.</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that watching a competition was a great way to improve strength, and perhaps, the onlookers would experience a sudden epiphany and make a breakthrough in their current level.</p>

  <p>But a point was too costly for outer disciples. Only disciples from noble clans could bear such a cost. Even so, they gnashed their teeth when they used two cubic crystals to exchange for a point. The poor disciples were worse off— they didn't have enough cubic crystals and couldn't complete tasks in exchange for points. Finally, they had no choice but to miss this great opportunity and watch the competition through the Picture Slab with the function of a live broadcast.</p>

  <p>The picture quality on Cloud Sect's Picture Slab was pretty good, but it was not the same experience as watching the match from the arena.</p>

  <p>The points collected during the competition were estimated to be over a hundred thousand based on the number of the disciples on the site of the All Peaks Competition. In fact, there were so many disciples that they surrounded the arena in several concentric circles!</p>

  <p>Yan wore a purple mask and stood in a corner. Her perfectly shaped eyes were filled with astonishment when she saw how many people had come to witness the match. She had attended the All Peaks Competition before, but she had never seen so many onlookers on site and such a large-scale competition like today. 'Has Cloud Sect developed far beyond my imagination in the past few years? I keep hearing so many of them talking about Luo Zheng. Since when did my brother gain such popularity?' Yan wondered.</p>

  <p>Even Yan, a rising star, didn't receive so much attention and such popularity the year in which she participated.</p>

  <p>Her mind was unable to find rational answers to all these questions. But in a few moments, she didn't want to think more about it. Her long eyelashes flickered as she took a deep breath. Then her eyes narrowed into crescents the moment she saw Luo Zheng walking into the arena and waving at her!</p>
