<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Stone stalagmites protruded from the cave walls.</p>

  <p>However, these stalagmites were too far in between to be used as stepping stones towards the exit.</p>

  <p>This fact made Zheng itch with frustration.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult to solve the third hall since there were some hints.</p>

  <p>The long hooks on the side helped them figure out a part of the puzzle to move forward.</p>

  <p>But this fourth hall wasn't really giving them any. How in the world could they get through this lava lake in front of them?</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down at the bubbling pool of molten rock, all the way to the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant had multiple cracks on its body where flames and molten lava spurted out.</p>

  <p>Noticing this, Zheng suddenly had an idea.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the path is through these Lava Giants," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Janet heard him and smiled, "I thought so too."</p>

  <p>A mountain-sized Lava Giant stood on one side of the lake, and a couple of thousand feet behind it was another one, and then another. They were all lined up perfectly, almost like a bridge to the other side.</p>

  <p>"But how can we ever convince them to help us cross?" Jeffrey asked.</p>

  <p>The idea seemed crazy at first but they didn't really have any other suggestions.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded toward the nearest one. "I'll get that big guy's attention and bring it over." He quickly took out his dark gold longbow and notched a black arrow from his quiver.</p>

  <p>They weren't really sure if it was going to work but nobody dared stop him. Zheng was too much of an asset in getting through the Hall of Causality for them to interrupt him.</p>

  <p>"Zoom!"</p>

  <p>The black arrow was released and shot towards the first Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>There was quite a distance to travel and halfway towards its destination, the arrow let out an explosive sound and sped up for its second phase. It was faster and even more powerful than before.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The arrow hit its target and a black ray immediately exploded out of the Lava Giant's chest. It was too big of a target to miss.</p>

  <p>They all held their breaths as they stared at the Lava Giant. They had to be ready to run at the first sign of trouble. They had already recouped the five million Illusion Points they had spent entering here. Not to mention the amount they would lose if they actually died was essentially half of their accumulated points.</p>

  <p>It took a few seconds for the Lava Giant to turn but it only seemed to just be stretching. Zheng's arrow had been explosive but it didn't cause that much of a damage to the creature. It didn't even seem to have noticed it.</p>

  <p>"It didn't work," Zheng said, turning to Hailey.</p>

  <p>Her bow was a supreme divine weapon which meant it was way stronger than Zheng's. She was their only hope now.</p>

  <p>Hailey understood the meaning beneath his gaze. In fact, she already had her Moon Bursting Flame Bow out and ready.</p>

  <p>She pulled on the string and took aim.</p>

  <p>Flames whirled in front of the bow as the scarlet arrow was notched into the string.</p>

  <p>"Boff!"</p>

  <p>Hailey's arm did not shake as she released her hold and shot the arrow towards the Lava Giant!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The arrow had been coated in powerful flames and exploded upon contact. The fire spread and burned fiercely upon the surface of the Lava Giant's molten exterior.</p>

  <p>It seemed the Moon Bursting Flame Bow did its part.</p>

  <p>But the Lava Giant remained unbothered. It was a high level being born from the union of the Fire and Earth Laws. These flames were not a threat to it.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant merely absorbed the flames through the cracks on its scraggly surface.</p>

  <p>Hailey shook her head in disappointment. "It's useless..."</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a huge rock shot above her head and towards the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>It was Coleman! He laughed as they turned to look at him, "I also wanted to give it a try."</p>

  <p>He had found a three feet wide rock from somewhere and decided to throw it straight at the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>"Your rock's nothing but a pebble against that thing," Jeffrey sneered. He had initially proposed to exterminate Coleman and never treated him seriously. The ogre was as good as useless to their team as far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>Coleman, however, simply pointed at the stone with a smile. "It hit!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to see the large stone hit the Lava Giant's shoulder and immediately explode into smithereens.</p>

  <p>Just as Jeffrey said, the large rock was nothing more than a pebble to the mountain-like creature.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey snorted in disdain, proven right with his claim. He was about to mock Coleman when the Lava Giant suddenly trembled and began moving.</p>

  <p>"No way... It actually worked?"</p>

  <p>Coleman murmured in shock. He never thought his rock would do anything. It was just a rock, a mere pebble to the molten giant. How in the world did it work?</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Zheng, Jeffrey, Janet and the others were also greatly surprised.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant remained motionless in the face of explosive and powerful attacks from Hailey and Zheng. Their weapons were most probably insignificant trinkets to its eyes, not really enough to cause it any harm.</p>

  <p>But why did a stone have such an effect?</p>

  <p>"Coleman, just where did you get that stone?" Janet turned but only saw dead air. "Where is he?" The ogre had already run away, afraid that the Lava Giant would chase him, or even worse— kill him.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is wrong with him?!" Jeffrey said as he saw Coleman's back running out of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Ogres were not highly regarded among the other races but they had always been known to be brave warriors, who were often willing to put everything on the line for a victory. This was their greatest strength.</p>

  <p>It was rare to see an ogre run away because of fear.</p>

  <p>"Wait, look!" Hailey said. "The Lava Giant wasn't alarmed by Coleman's stone."</p>

  <p>Everyone shifted their gazes and saw a large number of flame kittens appear in the lava. It wasn't the stone but these flame kittens that made the creature turn around!</p>

  <p>"Meow! Meow!"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant was trying to grab them. These flame kittens were agile but only a few managed to escape the Lava Giant's grasp as its large hand scooped them out of the molten lake.</p>

  <p>Once the creature had these kittens, it quickly shoved them into its mouth!</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom!"</p>

  <p>The flame kittens let out terrible, shrill cries as they exploded into balls of wild, dancing flames within the Lava Giant's mouth.</p>

  <p>Janet's eyes suddenly lit up in understanding. "These flame kittens! They must be the Lava Giants' food. They take these little things as food!"</p>

  <p>"So what you're saying is: the only way to get these guys' attention is by relying on these little flame kittens?" Zheng murmured faintly.</p>

  <p>Janet nodded but there was a frown on her face, "The problem is, these little flame kittens aren't that easy to deal with as well. Do we have to capture them in order to attract that big guy?"</p>
