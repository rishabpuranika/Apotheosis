<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4264 A Bad Feeling </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking at the giant's silly reaction, Geoffrey felt a little depressed.</p>

  <p>Something in his mind seemed to spark and he remembered what Elder Xue had told him. The creatures born after the disaster in the Deep Space were very stupid. In fact, they were not even able to cultivate due to a lack of intelligence.</p>

  <p>The Abstruse Energy World had also encountered a great disaster once.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey thought that the situation here was most probably similar to that of the Deep Space. These giants' intelligence quotient seemed pitifully low.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen your master?" Ziya asked him.</p>

  <p>Since these giants were not very smart, they could only inquire things little by little. Ziya was much more experienced in talking in a way that they could understand.</p>

  <p>"No. But he talks in our minds," the giant answered.</p>

  <p>Ziya nodded and then continued, "Can everyone in your race hear him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the giant affirmed.</p>

  <p>"It's a will that descends into their minds," Ziya muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>"No one in the fourth-grade world has such a powerful soul. Is he the downgrader?" Geoffrey theorized.</p>

  <p>"That's quite likely," Ziya nodded as he looked at the purple crystals behind the giants. Then he asked, "How did you get these crystals?"</p>

  <p>If it really were the downgrader who controlled these giants, then the purple crystals would have been his giving since the giants finding them on their own was highly unlikely.</p>

  <p>It was hard to say whether the downgrader could return to the Abstruse Energy World, but he could definitely find a way to ship or smuggle the purple crystals out of the chaos. And these crystals might contain some clues of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"They were given to us by our patriarch. It was he who gave us our powerful strength," one of the giants explained.</p>

  <p>"And where is your patriarch?" Ziya asked gently.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a loud voice seemed to come from afar. "No need to inquire about me. I'm here!"</p>

  <p>There was a soft shimmering on the top of a mountain not far away from them, and a giant the size of a hill appeared on its peak.</p>

  <p>The giant's head was inlaid with hundreds, if not thousands of purple crystals, which spread all the way from his head to his arms. The strangest thing was that at the bottom of those crystals, blood was seeping out. They must have been stabbed into his body not long ago.</p>

  <p>Then, giant after giant emerged from the top of the mountain. In the blink of an eye, well over a thousand of them were visible.</p>

  <p>Ziya immediately went on high alert and held the God Lashing Whip tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's great! We won't have to waste time!"</p>

  <p>With a smile on his face, Geoffrey rushed out and stomped on the mountain. He then turned into a huge arc and smashed towards the patriarch.</p>

  <p>Seeing Geoffrey take action first, the members of the Colossus race roared in unison.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Before Geoffrey could reach halfway, every single crystal on the patriarch's body began to glow.</p>

  <p>A huge power stimulated every meridian in his body. His eyes turned red, and like a machine, his giant fist struck out towards Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound was heard.</p>

  <p>The giant had actually managed to block Geoffrey's attack. However, he paid a heavy price for that. His thick arm began to crack, the purple crystals embedded in his arm shot out like sharp arrows, and more than half of his shoulder was torn apart.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey then stepped forward and grabbed the patriarch's huge head with one hand. "Where did you get these crystals? You have nine seconds to answer or you die!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Colossus race had never thought that their prey would be so powerful. Time seemed to stand still for a moment.</p>

  <p>All the giants, including the patriarch, did not even dare to move.</p>

  <p>"They... They were given to us by our master," the patriarch stammered.</p>

  <p>"Where is your master? Nine seconds or..." Geoffrey threatened.</p>

  <p>Just as the patriarch was about to speak, the purple crystals on his back began to glow once again. But this time, the glow seemed a bit different, almost berserk.</p>

  <p>Then, as if he had truly lost his mind and didn't care about Geoffrey's threat at all, the giant suddenly threw his remaining arm towards Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he tried to make his move, Geoffrey tightened his grip instantly, and the patriarch's head exploded into confetti.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>"Kill them!"</p>

  <p>"Eliminate the outsiders!"</p>

  <p>The giants swiftly surrounded Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't seem to have a desire for revenge for the death of their patriarch. Instead, the purple crystals on their bodies had begun flashing and filling their bodies with a violent power that could control their souls. They had turned into a group of puppets and were now attacking the enemy.</p>

  <p>"You are too slow and weak to be of any use to yourselves!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey felt like he was fighting with children when faced with these giants.</p>

  <p>His figure became a blur as he moved rapidly between the giants. Every time he passed by one of them, a fist mark would land on their heads, which would then deform, crack, and finally shatter at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The giants, like heavy doors, were continuously smashed onto the ground.</p>

  <p>In less than thirty seconds, Geoffrey had killed about thirty of them.</p>

  <p>However, when he turned around, he saw that there were still many giants on the top of the mountain. He had taken a spoon out of the ocean.</p>

  <p>"There are too many of them. Kill them all!" Geoffrey ordered as he raised his Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>About one third of his strength was extracted and filled the staff.</p>

  <p>Then thunder began to form and brew in the Heavenly Ring Staff. Its crisp crackle reached Geoffrey's ears and a sinister smile raised his lips.</p>

  <p>Then with a loud and violent noise, the whole mountain in front of them was shrouded in a burst of powerful lightning, which lasted only for an instant. Once it had disappeared, the giants were still able to maintain their original postures, with some of them climbing and some running forwards, but their bodies were charred and their vitality had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Although Ziya had witnessed the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff before, he was still shocked.</p>

  <p>The number of energies would be reduced in a higher-grade world. Ziya's strength was greatly weakened in the Abstruse Energy World, even though it was extremely terrifying in the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, if Geoffrey's attack was so powerful in the Abstruse Energy World itself, just how powerful would it be in the chaos?</p>

  <p>Looking at the giant corpses on the ground, Geoffrey seemed a little worried. "They are all being controlled. Our opponent is too cunning."</p>

  <p>However, Ziya was not discouraged. "Hmm... Since he's targeting us, he will definitely attack us again."</p>

  <p>While they were talking, another sound came from not far away. Geoffrey smiled faintly and then told him, "It looks like you are right."</p>

  <p>But when he looked into the distance, his face suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>Another group of members of the Colossus race had appeared on the mountain top.</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand of them, and their leader was the same patriarch that they had seen just a few moments ago. Even the pattern in which the purple crystals had been stuck on the patriarch's body was the same.</p>

  <p>Ziya also felt that something was wrong. "What's going on? Are these giants mere clones?"</p>

  <p>"Fight them!"</p>

  <p>The patriarch waved his arm and every single giant rushed over towards them.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey frowned and raised the Heavenly Ring Staff with some hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Kill them."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff once again extracted a third of Geoffrey's strength and lightning fell.</p>

  <p>A burst of violent thunder managed to completely annihilate a large group of giants. But this came at a great cost.</p>

  <p>After exploding thunder on their heads two times in a row, Geoffrey felt slightly weak. More than two thirds of his strength had been consumed. If he used this move a third time, he would no longer be able to use the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>The power of this staff was totally dependent on the user's strength.</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey had been strengthened for two times by the Levitation Tower and he was easily comparable to a top-level warrior in the Deep Space, his strength was still limited in magnitude.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a bad feeling came over him. The hidden opponent knew him and the Heavenly Ring Staff very well. He was trying to tire him out.</p>
