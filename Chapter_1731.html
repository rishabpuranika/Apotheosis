</p>

  <p id="top_16">The only way to move long distances in the universe was through spatial transference.</p>

  <p>One was required to have a deep understanding of the Space Law and reach the level of a world lord before carrying it out. The level of one's cultivation seemed to determine the distance they could reach.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Supreme Lords who had wanted to capture Luo Luo Zheng gathered together in a mere day or two.</p>

  <p>The world lords, however, had to wait a long time before they could catch up to them.</p>

  <p>Freya raised her hands to her cheeks. She did not understand what was happening, but she did not give voice to her doubts, satisfied to watch Luo Zheng's every move silently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was unsure about using the Teleportation Token in the universe.</p>

  <p>Under the infusion of his chaotic energy, the token emitted a faint white light.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>With a light chirp, the space around Luo Luo Zheng began to vibrate.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>However, the space only continued to tremble, as if a monster was trying to tear it apart. At the same time, muffled sounds were heard, similar to firecrackers exploding underwater.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Freya took a few steps to the side. She was getting more and more confused. 'Does he want to summon a beast?' she wondered, cocking her head.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the muted sounds died down.</p>

  <p>"Did I fail? It can't be..." Luo Luo Zheng sighed, his brow creased slightly. If the Teleportation Token was rendered useless, it would not have caused such a commotion.</p>

  <p>However, he also did not sense any fluctuations from the Space Law.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a figure flew over to him. It was Saul.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Saul's face, his eyes seeming to pierce through Luo Luo Zheng. "Luo Luo Zheng, did you plan on carrying out the spatial transference here?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Saul laughed and said, "Here, spatial transference is impossible!"</p>

  <p>This time it was Luo Zheng's turn to stare. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Saul pointed toward the sky. The enchanted barrier enveloped the entire Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Immortal Mansion was not known to exist in the universe. It was located in a world where all things seemed giant in size. Luo Luo Zheng had only utilized the token of mountain to create a node and an illusion.</p>

  <p>Only then did Saul tell Luo Luo Zheng that even a True God would be unable to carry out spatial transference in the Immortal Mansion, whereas Luo Luo Zheng was only a warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm. He could just walk around.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>He had first felt the strangeness of the forest when encountering the white tiger, but he did not expect this place to be so different.</p>

  <p>"Where is this place?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Saul only smiled mysteriously, saying that Luo Luo Zheng would find out eventually, when the time came.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not press him again. Saul had only told him a limited number of things. He would not tell Luo Luo Zheng anything that he thought the latter should not know about. Sometimes, Luo Luo Zheng doubted that the man was a mere puppet.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng could not carry out spatial transference in the Immortal Mansion, he could only leave and enter the universe again to test his luck.</p>

  <p>But judging from the commotion he had just experienced, Luo Luo Zheng estimated that the Teleportation Token would be effective.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was almost certain about it, so he decided to observe the situation in the outside world through the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>The world lords seemed to have been recalled back by their own great races, but Luo Luo Zheng still had to be on his guard. Indeed, he had secured the so-called number one position in the Illusion Battlefield and was a favored warrior by fate, but that did not mean he would not die.</p>

  <p>If Yao arranged for a world lord to kill Luo Luo Zheng in secret, it would only take an instant for him to bite the dust.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had stepped into the Spirit Supreme Realm and his cultivation level had greatly improved, he still could not think of any successful way he could face a world lord and emerge the victor. If he waited until he reached the Spirit Transformation Realm and gained strength to fight a world lord, he would at least have the power to protect himself. Maybe then, he could even defeat one of the world lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had Saul control the Immortal Mansion to fly away for a few days. He transmuted the Immortal Mansion into a grain of sand and pierced through a star.</p>

  <p>After the Immortal Mansion climbed out of the star, Luo Luo Zheng immediately walked out of the palace. Freya had originally wanted to follow him out, but he stopped her in her tracks. He wanted her to stay back in the palace.</p>

  <p>The instant Luo Luo Zheng left the Immortal Mansion, he activated the Teleportation Token in his hand.</p>

  <p>As it activated, acute spatial fluctuations wrapped around him like a tornado.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At the moment, the Teleportation Token was connected to the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng fell into a strange space.</p>

  <p>Next, what appeared before him was a majestic scene. The stars in the sky seemed to have condensed together, densely packed like grains of dazzling sand. Below each grain was a disc.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze wandered over them slowly, his face lighting up.</p>

  <p>He could see that each of the discs represented a supreme world. This was the epitome of the entire universe!</p>

  <p>The fact that the Teleportation Token could achieve this was almost beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>Thin lines were marked beneath each disc. The one hundred thousand discs represented a hundred thousand supreme worlds. The lines extended from the bottom of the discs all the way down.</p>

  <p>"The other ends of the lines lead to the great worlds in the Lower World..." Luo Zheng's eyes twinkled. The lines were complicated, perhaps representing a series of ascending passageways.</p>

  <p>The entire universe had shrunk by a number of times and then materialized in front of him. Just one look alone was enough to shock him.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Luo Luo Zheng had ascended and used his consciousness to travel in the universe, he had gazed down upon a million great worlds.</p>

  <p>However, at that time, he had not been able to look at their overall appearance. The great worlds in the distance had been hidden from his view, covered in darkness.</p>

  <p>Even now, Luo Luo Zheng could not view the great worlds very clearly. However, he could see that the great worlds were split into three parts by the black fog. There were probably more than a million great worlds in the boundless universe.</p>

  <p>Many of lines that linked these great worlds did not seem to extend to the Upper World, instead reaching to other places. Soon, Luo Luo Zheng understood that these particular places were separate in their own right, such as the Genuine Dragon World and the Genuine Phoenix World.</p>

  <p>He finally understood what was up as he stared at the rhombus-shaped great worlds. From the looks of it, the great worlds as a whole seemed like the back of some sort of vicious beast. The rhombus-shaped great worlds were the scales of the beast.</p>

  <p>Was he correct? Was it truly a vicious beast? Did such a creature actually exist in the universe?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not understand the mysteries pertaining to the great worlds. With the Teleportation Token, he seemed to be able to choose his destination easily. After confirming his position, he floated toward one of the discs.</p>

  <p>"He used the Teleportation Token so early!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on the face of the mysterious girl, who was known as Irene Jiang. She stood amidst layers of clouds. Naturally, Luo Luo Zheng was not aware that the impressive Teleportation Token had been created by her. A Supreme Lord could only use spatial transference time and again to cross supreme worlds. It was not easy to manipulate the direction of a long-distance teleportation. If a Supreme Lord did not pay enough attention, he might go to a wrong destination all together.</p>

  <p>In order to reach their destination, one had to teleport dozens of times, or even a hundred times. Devices such as the Teleportation Token, that made it rather easy to teleport, had never before appeared in the universe.</p>

  <p>Following a violent flash of light, Luo Luo Zheng materialized at his destination out of thin air.</p>

  <p>The moment he came into view, he started dropping from the skies.</p>

  <p>Hastily, he circulated his chaotic energy to float in the air.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he found himself at the height of a hundred thousand feet. Before him were vast plains.</p>

  <p>"It is the Bright Sun World, an independent supreme world," he murmured to himself, his gaze sweeping the area.</p>

  <p>Not all supreme worlds in the universe belonged to the great powers.</p>

  <p>The Bright Sun World was a supreme world that belonged to independent warriors. It could be said that it was a place a number of independent warriors yearned to be at because of the renowned Sword Manor that was located here.</p>

  <p>Independent warriors were not restricted. All races were allowed to coexist in this particular supreme world.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the Sword Manor was also one of the great powers.</p>

  <p>However, it did not impose too great of a restriction on the independent warriors that chose to join it. For those who desired freedom, it was, in fact, an excellent choice of destination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had some priorities and many other questions to settle, but most important to him right now was to become a Godly Genius. For this purpose, the trip to Sword Manor was imperative to him.</p>

  <p>Flying high in the sky for some time, he took note of the various black dots on the plains. These could be villages and cities, but they appeared to be as small as ants.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately leaned to one side and shuttled downward.</p>
