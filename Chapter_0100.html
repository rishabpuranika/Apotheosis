<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 100 Transformation Into The Spiritual Weapon (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the moment, the two huge beasts were too busy focusing on each other to notice Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One of the beasts, the queen blade locust, had a broken limb from her earlier scuffle with Luo Luo Zheng. In spite of being at a disadvantage, the one remaining limb was still a powerful lethal weapon shaped like the blade of a sword. Alongside her blade, the queen blade locust was a little bigger than the fire scorpion lion.</p>

  <p>Although the fire scorpion lion was smaller than the queen blade locust, it was nimbler. Further, since the lava cave was the fire scorpion lion's natural habitat, it had an advantage.</p>

  <p>As soon as the beasts collided in battle, the cave shook, rocks tumbled, and the cavern floor was littered with rubble.</p>

  <p>Rocks fell from high up on the walls of the cave, and fire spouted out of the earth's core.</p>

  <p>"Crash, bam!"</p>

  <p>"Ba-boom!"</p>

  <p>Loud clashing sounds ensued as the fire scorpion lion threw the queen blade locust on the floor swiftly.</p>

  <p>In spite of the aggressive attack, the queen blade locust forcibly stomped the ground with her hind legs, thrusting the fire scorpion lion backward about one foot.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the queen rushed towards the lion and flung her enormous blade at the fire scorpion lion. However, the lion evaded her attack and snarled before retaliating. The locust, which could only survive by slaughtering, was much more courageous and brutal than ordinary beasts.</p>

  <p>"Skrressh!" came the horrifying sound of the blade slicing into the flesh of the fire scorpion lion. Its heart and other organs spilled out. The fire scorpion lion, mortally injured, wailed mournfully. At the same time, cocking its nimble tail up, the lion slashed at the queen blade locust's head.</p>

  <p>"Snap!"</p>

  <p>The queen blade locust couldn't dodge in time, resulting in her head splitting and falling to the ground because of the force of scorpion tail.</p>

  <p>Without her head, the queen's body became limp, and the blade trembled for a moment before her carcass slumped to the ground. The lion's organs were rent into pieces, and the large lion whimpered before tilting his head and gasping his last breaths.</p>

  <p>People became apprehensive at the mere mention of these two huge beasts. They would be awestruck to see the two dead in this cave at the same time...</p>

  <p>....</p>

  <p>....</p>

  <p>At first, when faced with the two beasts, Luo Luo Zheng thought he was doomed to perish.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he was roasted by Evil Lan's fire. Instead of being harmed, Luo Luo Zheng became physically stronger, thereby becoming comparable to a top grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>But, the fire from the earth's core was different from Evil Lan's grade two fire. It was many times stronger than Evil Lan's fire.</p>

  <p>After all, Evil Lan was only a half-step into the nature level. In the strictest sense, his fire evolved from his life energy rather than life vitality.</p>

  <p>However, the earth's core fire was much mightier than the fire produced by any nature level weapon refiners even with life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt the sensation of burning as soon as he jumped into the lava.</p>

  <p>He had experienced the same pain twice before, once in the cellar of the Luo family and the other was in Evil Lan's weapon refining furnace, so, in this cave, it came to be that he felt it for the third time.</p>

  <p>In his current position, he knew that aside from gritting his teeth and toughing it out, he was helpless. He could pray to the God to bless his success against the earth's core fire, keeping his corporeal form from being incinerated, but, there was nothing more he could do.</p>

  <p>Slowly, his complexion started to change. Overall, Luo Luo Zheng looked like a red-hot piece of iron, glowing dark red.</p>

  <p>As his body heated up and burned, countless little gold pieces appeared on his body. Subsequently, they started to rotate.</p>

  <p>As they whirled faster and faster, the gold pieces changed into golden eddies and began to absorb the fire from the earth's core.</p>

  <p>The fire that engulfed Luo Luo Zheng was swiftly taken into the eddies and absorbed by Luo Luo Zheng. However, the swirls covering Luo Zheng's body were not satisfied.</p>

  <p>After absorbing all the fire surrounding Luo Luo Zheng, the eddies generated a mightier force and pulled the earth's core fire from farther away.</p>

  <p>Wisps, streaks, and flakes of fire were sucked in by a gravitational force, madly rushing into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>All the earth's core fire within the large lava lake rapidly converged in his body.</p>

  <p>If anyone was present outside the lava lake at that moment, they would be astounded at the sight.</p>

  <p>In the center of the lake where the lava had been boiling, the lava's color gradually changed from red to black as it cooled. At last, the lava was pitch black and solid. As the pitch black area expanded, more and more lava cooled, becoming solid carbon black rocks.</p>

  <p>At last, the entire lake was a sizeable hardened rock.</p>

  <p>Except for a few spots where the lava remained slightly dark red, the cave, which had been bright, now was in complete darkness.</p>

  <p>A long while later, the lava lake suddenly cracked in the center, and a hand shot out from the crack. It was Luo Zheng's hand reaching upward, with a few pieces of gold foil glittering with a golden light. Afterward, Luo Luo Zheng hit the solid lava with his head, smashing it. He crawled out of the broken rock.</p>

  <p>A sweet smile spread across Luo Zheng's face as it dawned on him that he had survived an impossible situation.</p>

  <p>Everything that had transpired was far beyond his ability to comprehend.</p>

  <p>When he jumped into the lake of lava to escape from certain doom, shockingly, his body absorbed the earth's core fire in the lake. Perhaps his physical strength was improved after being refined by the flames.</p>

  <p>He looked down at his body and noticed that his chest had a wave-like texture to it.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change, Luo Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>

  <p>In the back of his mind, he felt as though he'd seen that texture, and he recognized the pattern from somewhere!</p>

  <p>After contemplating the design, it struck him where he'd seen it!</p>

  <p>Clapping his hands, he shouted, "Yes! I remember now! It's a spiritual texture!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen such textures in the books of weapon refining techniques left by Evil Lan.</p>

  <p>Weapons fell into a few classes. They were mysterious, spiritual, fairy, sacred and divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Except there were no unique textures on mysterious weapons, special characters similar to this were found only on treasures like spiritual, fairy, and sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>For instance, spiritual textures were on spiritual weapons and fairy textures on fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>A streak of spiritual texture showed up on Luo Zheng's chest, which meant his body had possibly entered a different stage, turning from a mysterious weapon into a spiritual weapon!</p>
