<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2904 Entering The Mountain Of Holy Beings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng, Tianming, and Sword Chen came out of the space channel as soon as the Scepter of Gods' Silence was activated.</p>

  <p>Throughout the divine land, only the three of them, Estelle and Holy Jay were exempted from the effects of the Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his two companions didn't stop for a second as they hurriedly left the space channel and rushed towards the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings which was just a hundred feet away from them.</p>

  <p>But just as they were about to go there, the Sea Cracking Skull in the Hall of Holy Beings above the Time Sea suddenly opened its mouth.</p>

  <p>"What a good job! Your cooperation is so perfect, but it's such a pity..."</p>

  <p>At that time, Leyton was standing at the top of the Hall of Holy Beings, waving his hand in the direction of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Upon activation of the Sea Cracking Skull, the entire divine land slightly vibrated, with a strong smell of blood coming right out of its mouth.</p>

  <p>In fact, this vibration was quite similar to the one that happened when the Mountain of Holy Beings emerged, but in a weaker and less violent state.</p>

  <p>The Scepter of Gods' Silence used the power of the entire divine land to repress all the living beings in its territory, but during this process, the Sea Cracking Skull had actually broken free.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Flowing from the distance, the blood torrents rolled towards the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>If Zheng, Tianming and Sword Chen forced their ways into the Mountain of Holy Beings, then they would definitely be washed away by the strong torrents.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the gate was only about a hundred feet away, Tianming and Sword Chen could not help but hesitate upon seeing that the torrents kept rolling faster and faster by the second.</p>

  <p>"Rush in!"</p>

  <p>Zheng roared as he ordered. They only had one chance, and there was no way back, so they had to quickly get inside as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's command, Tianming and Sword Chen gnashed their teeth and sped up.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Time Jade Seal in Zheng's right hand appeared. But the moment he activated it, they were engulfed by the blood torrents.</p>

  <p>As all of this was happening, Leyton was still standing at the top of the Hall of Holy Beings, looking indifferently at the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Smiling, he said, "They should be dead..." Before he could finish his words, he felt time fluctuate right before his eyes.</p>

  <p>From a distance, he clearly saw three ripples near the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings. These ripples, however, indicated that the three were able to pass through the gate, meaning that they were not devoured by the bloody torrents.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I should have considered that Zheng has the ability to erase time!"</p>

  <p>In fact, Leyton could still feel time being erased even when he was sealed in the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>But just now, the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence spread out and attracted all of his attention. He thought that after he broke the imprisonment of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, Zheng and his companions would definitely die, which was the reason why he ignored Zheng's jade seal.</p>

  <p>Twitching his eyelids, he felt that he was being mocked. He stood still for a long period of time.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings beneath his feet couldn't hold his strength anymore, and cracks spread out in front of the hall.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings who fell at high speeds were desperate as they were getting closer and closer to the colorful sea water. At that point, they already knew that death was knocking at the door.</p>

  <p>Luckily, they had maintained quite a height before, and the Scepter of Gods' Silence only lasted for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Just when they were only about several hundred feet away from the sea surface, the effect of the Scepter of Gods' Silence had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Without the restrictions of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, everyone felt that their powers were back. Being back to normal, some people hurried to stop in the air, while some used the Grand Teleportation to move upwards.</p>

  <p>However, not everyone was lucky at that time. A consummate True God didn't maintain a height before he used the Grand Teleportation, making him fall into the sea. As a result, he was cut into pieces by the time fragments and later vanished in the sea.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Hamish and Salim were sent flying by the tentacles of the Emperor Resentment. After retreating dozens of miles in the air, they fell onto the ground, making two big and deep pits.</p>

  <p>As soon as the effects of the Scepter of Gods' Silence had disappeared, the two immediately climbed out of the pits.</p>

  <p>Salim, with a gloomy face, gritted his teeth and said, "I'm going to chop this foolish beast into pieces!"</p>

  <p>"With that, I agree," replied Hamish coldly and angrily.</p>

  <p>After finishing their words, they appeared on the Emperor Resentment's head in a flash.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Leif knelt down on one knee on the other side of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Covered in bruises all over his body, he had one arm missing, while the other held a bronze dagger-axe with all the strength that he had left.</p>

  <p>"It's really surprising. I didn't expect that a guy at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm could have such means," said Zavier, as he walked towards Leif.</p>

  <p>Leif and Zavier had a huge difference when it came to their strength, but as they battled it out a while ago, Leif was able to hold Zavier back.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Leif flipped his hand, and the bronze dagger-axe changed its direction, stabbing Zavier again.</p>

  <p>"Now, you are like a spent arrow," sneered Zavier. He reached out his hand and grabbed the front end of the bronze dagger-axe. Pulling it slightly, he took it away from Leif's hand.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Leif had used up his last strength and was not able to resist it anymore.</p>

  <p>"You know what? I have always respected people with a strong fighting will. That is why I won't make you suffer when I kill you." At his words, he had raised the bronze dagger-axe high and struck Leif with a heavy thud.</p>

  <p>Not long after Leif's death, the Emperor Resentment was unable to resist the attack of Salim and Hamish, letting out a long and sad screech.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Just then, its huge body swayed sideways and later fell onto the ground with a loud bang. With the intensity of the fall, it never got up again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a thousand miles away, Holy Jay saw this scene and let out a sigh. "Even the Holy Beings are afraid of the Emperor Resentment. But I didn't expect it to be killed by the Yellow Emperor Guards."</p>

  <p>Estelle shook her head as her face looked sad.</p>

  <p>In fact, she could only use the Scepter of Gods' Silence once in a period of time. If she could use it continuously, then she would probably be able to save Leif. He wouldn't be killed as long as he had the chance to move to the space channel on the top of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. This place is too dangerous. What you did just now will surely alert the Yellow Emperor Guards," Holy Jay explained.</p>

  <p>Estelle nodded and soon left quietly using the Grand Teleportation from the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>This fierce battle did not last long.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the battle was over, the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods turned their attention back to the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They thought they could get in after such a long time.</p>

  <p>However, just as they approached the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings, Hamish suddenly appeared in front of the gate again, blocking their way.</p>

  <p>Plucking up his courage, one of the Demi-holy Beings asked, "Are we not allowed to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Although the Emperor Resentment had already been killed, Hamish still did not feel good at all. Coldly, he replied, "I will let you in, but not right now!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Hamish seemed to have a murderous intent, the crowd didn't dare to say anything. If this warrior at the Other Shore Realm vented his anger on them, then they would die with grief plastered on their faces.</p>
