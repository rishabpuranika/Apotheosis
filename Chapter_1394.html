<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The warriors' attacks were futile under the suppression of absolute strength. At most, it could only create some obstacles for the opponent.</p>

  <p>This was the view shared by most of the warriors.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had easily broken through the eleventh round of the test, the twelfth round shouldn't cause too much trouble for him.</p>

  <p>There wasn't any trace of panic on his face, even if he was being attacked by more than a dozen warriors and his movements were restricted by vines.</p>

  <p>As the warriors surrounded him, a crackling sound suddenly came from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword!</p>

  <p>The difference between these warriors and those from thirteen palaces was not just in terms of talent or strength. Those warriors from thirteen palaces were also advanced when it came to the weapons they wielded.</p>

  <p>Those warriors wouldn't have any difficulty at all obtaining a third-rank or secondary second-rank divine weapon in the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword was one of the amazing first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>The sword would be much more powerful once combined with the Law Power that was erupting from the chaotic energy. It was something that these warriors could not withstand. Moreover, there was also the unstoppable Nether God Shadow.</p>

  <p>The power of thunder suddenly spread out around Luo Zheng. The bright blue lightning was only as thick as his pinky but it formed a circular thunder net with Luo Zheng as the center! This was equivalent to using a layer of thunder net to sift through the entire platform. There was no room for escape at all...</p>

  <p>The warriors attacking him immediately burned as if struck by lightning.</p>

  <p>Their bodies turned pitch black and after hovering in the air for about three seconds, they fell onto the platform.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng smelled the scorched flavor.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Another figure appeared in the air right after the thunder net eased out.</p>

  <p>This warrior's main cultivation method was making use of the Space Law and it was only him who survived the attack.</p>

  <p>However, just as this warrior had avoided the attack and was plotting to assassinate Luo Zheng, seven figures had appeared before him. These were the seven Nether God Shadows cast by Luo Zheng. In the blink of an eye, they had torn that warrior into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then passed the twelfth round...</p>

  <p>Compared to the eleventh round, the twelfth round was a bit strenuous for Luo Zheng. It was relatively more challenging than those he had already passed.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know though was that there were tens of thousands of warriors with depressed faces, standing just on the other side of the Willow Island. They had made a plan to force Luo Zheng to use the ace in the hole. However, Luo Zheng only relied on the Thunder Wind Divine Sword even after twelve rounds.</p>

  <p>Could it be that he relied solely on this sword?</p>

  <p>The warrior named Adrian was still indifferent while sucking the wooden stick. Zheng's state of mind was much more stable than he had imagined. He couldn't guess which aspect Luo Zheng was good at. Thus, he had arranged the advanced and fierce warriors to take Luo Zheng down.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he still failed to provoke Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>How could such a talent only rely on his weapon? He couldn't believe how Luo Zheng completely ignored what he did. After spending a while fighting those warriors, Luo Zheng still passed the twelfth round without using anything else but his sword.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng should be more troublesome, ' Adrian thought disdainfully.</p>

  <p>He then gazed at the highest point of the enormous square.</p>

  <p>The tens of thousands of warriors in the whole square were arranged in a fan-shaped formation with the low level warriors standing at the front.</p>

  <p>The number of high-level warriors at the back was very small. It was only normal for any place to have a lot of low-level warriors and only a few high-level warriors. This place was no exception to that.</p>

  <p>It was just that most of the talents of thirteen palaces tended to stop at around the eleventh or twelfth round. Only very few warriors had the guts and qualifications to challenge other more powerful warriors. This number would even be lesser in the eighteenth round, the nineteenth, or the twentieth round. Thus, it wasn't really necessary to arrange more powerful warriors for the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>The existence of some extraordinary talents had also been taken into account when the Illusion Space was designed and built.</p>

  <p>There were several cages standing at the highest point of the square.</p>

  <p>Inside those cages were burly but ragged warriors.</p>

  <p>They were the condemned prisoners from the Villain World and the ultimate challenge in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>But until now, no warriors had the chance to challenge the prisoners in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>The reason why Adrian showed up at this moment was because of these condemned prisoners!</p>

  <p>The battle that Layla took part in had not been over yet.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had thought, Layla planned to use the Sword Cry Technique before the twentieth round of the test.</p>

  <p>If Adrian hadn't appeared and meddled in the fight, Layla's Sword Cry Technique would have been enough to deal with all her battles in the first nineteen rounds. It wouldn't have been easy to break her Sword Cry Technique. More so, it would have been impossible for the eleventh to nineteenth round warriors to defeat her.</p>

  <p>However, Layla soon discovered that her Sword Cry Technique had lost its effect during the twelfth round.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors that Luo Zheng encountered in the twelfth round were well trained in all sorts of dodging movements. Thus, he couldn't fight them head to head at all.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors Layla encountered were those who cultivated the Water Law!</p>

  <p>After the challenge began, the warriors created a curtain of water over the platform. Some of them even created a monstrous wave washing over the whole place.</p>

  <p>All liquids were viscous. Although Layla's Sword Cry Technique was extremely powerful, she was unable to perform it underwater. Her Sword Cry Technique's power was greatly reduced and couldn't even cause any warrior real harm.</p>

  <p>She was caught off guard by their attack and forgot to use her life vitality to protect herself. Thus, her entire body was thoroughly wet! Her clothes stuck to her body.</p>

  <p>Layla, of course, could guess what was going on. This was definitely a strategy that someone had deliberately set up to deal with her Sword Cry Technique.</p>

  <p>None of the warriors were talking nor approaching Layla. None of them were hiding from her too. However, each of them performed their own skills. Some of them continued to unleash large waves one after another towards Layla, while the others created water spears to attack her.</p>

  <p>These attacks were nothing in Layla's eyes. With a light wave of the cyan long sword in her hand, she easily dispelled the incoming attacks.</p>

  <p>Very soon, the corner of her mouth curled up into a smile. "You, you think that I can only use the Sword Cry Technique?"</p>

  <p>After saying that, she held the cyan sword above her head again. Her body trembled slightly as the cyan sword drew and left many sword shadows in its wake. She didn't want to kill all those warriors one by one. So, she was using some powerful sword skill to kill all the warriors on the platform with a single strike.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Adrian on the other side of the Willow Island said calmly,</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't think so. I just want to see how many trump cards you have..."</p>

  <p>Layla's actions were exactly what he wanted to see.</p>

  <p>The sword shadows Layla created with her sword started to spin faster and faster. The dense sword shadows covered Layla's entire body.</p>

  <p>At this time, the power of the Space Law surged from Layla!</p>

  <p>With her other hand, she gently waved in the air, causing the space outside of the sword shadows to directly collapse. She actually erased the surrounding space!</p>

  <p>"That is Kyron's Space Erasing Hand! It seems that he treats Layla well and even taught her such a great skill," remarked the lord of the Sunset World. His eyes were gleaming with familiarity as he watched the girl's cultivation skill.</p>

  <p>"This isn't how a Space Erasing Hand works. She's wasting it." Yolande commented flatly.</p>

  <p>The Space Erasing Hand was one of Kyron's famous consummate skills.</p>

  <p>It would require a deep comprehension of the Space Law for a warrior to use such a skill. When performing this skill, the warriors would need to stretch out their hands to touch the space and erase the place surrounding them, making it disappear.</p>

  <p>Of course, the space that Kyron could erase was naturally large compared to what Layla could. The girl was only able to erase the space outside of her sword shadows. It was a circular space that was over one hundred feet wide.</p>

  <p>The warriors using the Water Law cultivation were standing around the edge of the platform at first. However, their bodies had no option but to involuntarily moved as soon as the space around them was erased.</p>

  <p>This was also a special characteristic of space. Normally, a warrior who cultivated the Space Law might not be able to use the Space Erasing Hand. Nonetheless, they still understood the principles behind it.</p>

  <p>If a section of space in the middle was missing, the sections of space on both sides would instantly stick together!</p>

  <p>Those warriors were in the outer space of the platform when Layla had erased a circle of space in the middle. Thus at this moment, all the warriors were pulled to the center by the space as a section of space had been missing.</p>

  <p>And in the center of the platform, the sword shadows were still rapidly spinning. In a blink of an eye, those warriors, who had been pulled in, were cut into pieces.</p>
