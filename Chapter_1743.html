<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon did not reply.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took his silence to heart and felt very depressed.</p>

  <p>What was behind all these things?</p>

  <p>He knew that the answers weren't going to just present themselves on a silver platter for him, so he thought it best to explore by himself.</p>

  <p>He decided to continue on with the Glint Pearl. Except for the murals, there didn't seem to be anything else special about the hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng soon arrived at a room at the back of the hall. There was a cracking noise as soon as he entered.</p>

  <p>It seemed he had stepped upon something.</p>

  <p>He looked down at his feet and saw a cloud of dust rise.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lowered the Glint Pearl and saw exactly what he stepped on. It was a skeleton, a human skeleton.</p>

  <p>This skeleton must have been here for so long that it turned to dust the moment someone stepped on it.</p>

  <p>He continued looking around, his gaze flickering under the light.</p>

  <p>There was more than one skeleton here.</p>

  <p>Numerous bones were scattered all over the place. Some were still complete, meaning that the corpses remained intact.</p>

  <p>Or it could also mean that all these people died here.</p>

  <p>A person's body decomposed at a rate determined by the cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Killing Sword Mountain definitely had high cultivation levels since normal warriors would never be able to withstand the overwhelming killing Mu Ning along the way.</p>

  <p>After death, the skeletons of those who had been at the Soul Sea Realm and above would turn into bone jade and last for a very long time.</p>

  <p>However, bone jade did not last forever. Given enough time, the spiritual energy within the bone jade would drain completely, and the bone jade would start its degradation process. This took tens, even hundreds of thousands of years though.</p>

  <p>For these bones to immediately crumble under Zheng's weight meant that these corpses had been lying here for a very long time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Not wanting to crush any more bones, Luo Zheng opted to float two inches above the ground.</p>

  <p>This room wasn't very big. In fact, it was only around 50 to 60 feet wide.</p>

  <p>He circled around and found no windows, only a pile of skeletons.</p>

  <p>There was nothing meaningful in here.</p>

  <p>His lack of discovery puzzled Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had finally entered the Killing Sword Mountain but there seemed to be nothing here. That couldn't be right. Besides, he wasn't willing to leave this place empty-handed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng expected a trial, a challenge to test his skills. After the said challenge, he would then master the most important part of the Emotion Closing Godly Way and become a fully-fledged Godly Genius. It was all supposed to be simple and straightforward.</p>

  <p>This was the opposite of his expectations.</p>

  <p>He had gained nothing.</p>

  <p>"Check the center of the skeletons," Xun said. She floated beside him and pointed the Saint Killing Spear down to where the bones were.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked and found what seemed to be a disk hiding underneath all the piled-up skeletons. The disk was the same color as the ground, making it extremely easy to miss.</p>

  <p>He smiled at Xun. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"You're welcome."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he heard her cold answer. This feeling of estrangement made him very unhappy.</p>

  <p>He really wanted to know what happened to her.</p>

  <p>Who did she talk to when he had been away in the Illusion Battlefield?</p>

  <p>It would've been difficult and close to impossible for her to have communicated with anyone in the fairy palace. She also couldn't have left since the authority to enter and exit the place was in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Freya was also simple, almost like a child, so Xun would not have chatted with her.</p>

  <p>Livingston was deeply immersed in weapon refining so it also couldn't have been him.</p>

  <p>Could it be the cyan dragon?</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng entered the Illusion Battlefield and was locked inside that beam of light, Xun would've been able to talk to the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had kept silent just now. Did he say something to Xun? Luo Zheng fully trusted the two of them, but it seemed they were currently hiding something from him.</p>

  <p>He decided to just set aside his doubts for now. The first thing on his agenda was to find out what was underneath this room.</p>

  <p>Clearing away the bones, Luo Zheng stepped onto the disk. There was an echoing thump and sure enough, it was empty below the disk.</p>

  <p>A surge of power gathered at the joints of his forefinger and the surface of the disk suddenly shattered. It had been unable to withstand his weight, so he ended up falling down. Fortunately, he was able to stabilize his body.</p>

  <p>He was now inside a dark room. The Glint Pearl would be extremely useful in illuminating the darkness of this hole Luo Zheng had fallen in.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he threw it out, the Glint Pearl immediately disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>That shouldn't have happened. The Glint Pearl was an object that could emit light for a very long time. The moment Luo Zheng threw it, it should've illuminated the place it fell to. He heard a bang so it must've fallen onto the floor.</p>

  <p>Where was it then? Luo Zheng could no longer see where it exactly went.</p>

  <p>This could only mean one thing: there was an intense Dark Law in the room that completely blocked out all light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried using his magic vision but not even that could let him see what was below. It was entirely pitch black.</p>

  <p>Xun simply floated beside him and did not give any suggestions.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, he figured that there was only one way to find out what was inside the room. He had to go there himself.</p>

  <p>With a flip, Luo Zheng found himself inside the dark room. He truly couldn't see anything, not even his hand that he held up his face. The light above him had since disappeared. He was in absolute, total darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was extremely alert. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword had already been infused with chaotic energy. Any movement within the vicinity would be met with his quick counterattack.</p>

  <p>He stood extremely still for a while; however, there was nothing. Other than his own breathing, there was only silence.</p>

  <p>"Xun? Where are you?" he called out.</p>

  <p>"I'm here," her voice said beside him. Xun had followed him and, judging from the sound of her voice, she was only right beside him.</p>

  <p>"Can you see anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. There must be something here that releases the Dark Law,"</p>

  <p>Xun replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded but quickly realized that she probably couldn't see him. "I see," he answered, slowly walking forward in the darkness.</p>

  <p>An unseen enemy was truly the most troublesome opponent to deal with.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already felt something wrong ever since he entered the Killing Sword Mountain. It was as if someone was following him but he did not know who or what it was.</p>

  <p>He took exactly thirteen steps in the dark. The silence had him memorize each one.</p>

  <p>At the first sign of trouble, he would immediately leave this extremely dark room and return to the disk as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He was confident in his own strength but it was hard to be rash in an extremely strange place. He had no idea what horrors awaited him in the darkness.</p>

  <p>It was after taking thirty steps that Luo Zheng finally heard a sizzling sound.</p>

  <p>Was that right? Did he imagine it? Luo Zheng extended his ears and he could indeed hear a sound similar to claws scratching the ground.</p>

  <p>"Something is coming," he said. Luo Zheng squinted his eyes before closing them completely. He couldn't see anything and opening his eyes might create an illusion.</p>

  <p>With his eyes closed, he released his perception and felt the movements around him.</p>

  <p>At least, that was what was supposed to happen. The moment Luo Zheng released his perception, an invisible wall seemed to constrain him and blocked it.</p>

  <p>"My perception is blocked!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cursed. The sizzling sound now grew louder and ever closer.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>He thrust out his sword several times in a moment of desperation.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance should've been blinding but because of the Dark Law, all light was just immediately absorbed by the darkness.</p>

  <p>What made it worse was that each slash of his sword was the sound of something getting hit!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The sounds seemed to be a couple of extremely sharp forces that flew in from all directions, but all of them were bounced back.</p>

  <p>What were the walls of this dark room made of?</p>

  <p>It would be pointless to ask that since Luo Zheng couldn't see anything. All he knew was that if any of those sword strikes hit him instead, it would spell big trouble for him.</p>

  <p>He quietly activated the Eight Smoky Melodies as a precaution and stood still.</p>

  <p>Randomly dodging wasn't going to be an option. That would be even more dangerous since he couldn't see.</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng could do was strain his senses to try and dodge the sword beams based on the surrounding energy fluctuations.</p>

  <p>However, this technique wasn't going to be practical in the long run. If the sword radiance was directed at his face, then he wouldn't be able to dodge it with the current level of his Eight Smoky Melodies. A direct hit would break through the three-inch boundary very easily.</p>

  <p>He could only resign himself to his fate. Fortunately, his fate was extremely lucky.</p>
