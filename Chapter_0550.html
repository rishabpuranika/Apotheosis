  <p>
</p>

  <p>Several other practitioners were also annoyed by what the disciple of Cloud Hall had said. They had been planning to try their luck in the hidden test, but they were blocked outside the gate. Since they had no guts to fight with the disciples of Cloud Hall, they just anxiously stood aside.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know your place? You're not qualified. You could only be a genius in the second-grade sect, but not in our Cloud Hall. In here, you're nothing at all. I bet you won't even rank on the list of top one-hundred in Cloud Hall!" one of the Cloud Hall disciples said and laughed.</p>

  <p>His words offended all the practitioners of the other sects. Even some practitioners who hadn't planned to enter the island had a look of anger on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Really?" In a blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly appeared in front of the Cloud Hall disciple and grabbed him by the neck. He then dragged him to the edge of the high platform and had him hanging off the edge.</p>

  <p>Down the platform was a vast land of fire. If Luo Luo Zheng loosened his grip on the disciple's neck, the latter would directly fall into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Let go of me!" the disciple cried out angrily. He didn't seem to realize what was happening even after being attacked by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let you go? If you insist. But don't blame after." Luo Luo Zheng slightly loosened his grip. As the disciple slid down a little, he realized he would die once Luo Luo Zheng fully loosened his grip and let him go.</p>

  <p>"Asshole, pull me up!" he cursed in rage.</p>

  <p>"You still have the guts to curse me given the situation? I really admire your courage!" Luo Luo Zheng said and suddenly loosed his hands. Feeling his own body weight starting to pull him down, the disciple's eyes were filled with horror. He couldn't say even a single word now. But to his surprise, he didn't fall. Luo Luo Zheng was pinching his collar with two fingers.</p>

  <p>His life was now at the mercy of Luo Zheng's two fingers and his own collar!</p>

  <p>The two Cloud Hall disciples had thought that they were able to keep the other practitioners out of the hidden test without saying much. Because the Cloud Hall had a reputation and its disciples were known for their unrivaled skills and competence, the practitioners would not dare to break in the hidden test.</p>

  <p>With that, their vanity and arrogance would be gratified.</p>

  <p>The guy who was now hanging on the edge of the platform had thought that being a Cloud Hall disciple, he could have forced the countrymen to yield. With his current competence, it should have been difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to control him easily. He didn't think that Luo Luo Zheng would have dared to attack him. But he was blinded by his arrogance and underestimated Luo Luo Zheng. Now, his life was on Luo Zheng's mercy.</p>

  <p>'Is this guy crazy? Isn't he afraid of our Cloud Hall?' the disciple wondered. He was nervous and dared not to struggle at the fear of falling.</p>

  <p>'You'd better hope that your collar is strong enough to hold your weight.</p>

  <p>Now, tell me if I can enter the hidden test," Luo Luo Zheng ordered with a friendly smile. But in the disciple's eyes, he could see a smile of a devil.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other Cloud Hall disciple's face turned pale out of fear for his pal's life. He asked, "Do you know what you are doing? Are you trying to challenge Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned to him with an elusive look. Under his gaze, the disciple became even more scared. "All of you also want to pass the Cloud Road test. Right now, you're just ordinary Cloud Hall disciples wanting to be elites of Cloud Hall. I wonder why you think you have the qualification to represent Cloud Hall. Maybe your dad is the ruler of Cloud Hall?" Luo Luo Zheng said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I...," the disciple stuttered. Although their rankings were relatively high compared to the ordinary disciples of Cloud Hall, these two disciples were not special and couldn't be on par with the real elites of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>They also came here in the hope of getting promoted by taking the Cloud Road test.</p>

  <p>"Now, do you still want to block me out?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>"My fingers are feeling sore. You better make up your mind fast."</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Luo Zheng slightly loosened his grip on the disciple's collar and the latter slipped down a little. The disciple's collar was almost at the tip of Luo Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>The miserable disciple was more frightened than ever. His eyes widened, his breathing became heavy, and he couldn't move.</p>

  <p>"No! We won't block your way anymore! Just pull him up, please! And you can be on your way!" the other Cloud Hall disciple answered immediately. They didn't expect that a young practitioner at grade three of the nature level could be that tough. They couldn't say no anymore out of fear that Luo Luo Zheng would finally loosen his fingers.</p>

  <p>After hearing what the other disciple said, Luo Luo Zheng put a little strength on his fingers then pulled the disciple up. The disciple fell on the ground with his face slamming on the platform.</p>

  <p>As soon as he felt the platform, the disciple quickly jumped up and pulled out a dagger. The overwhelming life vitality erupted from his body in an instant. Now that he was out of danger, he was going to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But before he could thrust his dagger, a wound appeared on his arm.</p>

  <p>A stream of blood gushed from the wound and a portion of his arm fell onto the ground together with his dagger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his Streamer Sword. Blood was dripping down from the tip of the sword. Luo Luo Zheng said coldly, "You thought I was just messing with you, didn't you? You thought that I would let you go harmless? You thought that I wouldn't kill you just because you are a Cloud Hall disciple?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the sudden turn of events, the other practitioners on the high platform went silent.</p>

  <p>'The young man is so fucking tough!' they thought.</p>

  <p>The two female disciples of Iridescence Sect covered their mouths with their hands, afraid to make a sound that would attract any attention.</p>

  <p>At first, they thought that Luo Luo Zheng was overconfident by challenging Adler of Brumous Sect. In their mind, Luo Luo Zheng had challenged Adler in the thought that the latter wouldn't fight him on the high platform.</p>

  <p>Now, after Luo Luo Zheng cut off the Cloud Hall disciple's arm, they realized that he wasn't afraid of Adler at all.</p>

  <p>They couldn't imagine what would happen next.</p>

  <p>All the practitioners on the platform were top disciples in the second-grade sects. They might not be at par with the top ten disciples of Cloud Hall, but they were not afraid of these two disciples. What they revered was the authority of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Whether they came from Brumous Sect or Auspice Sect, the moment they had become the disciples of their sects, they had known about the Cloud Hall being a fourth-grade sect. The leaders of the second-grade sects could only be stewards in Cloud Hall. How supreme Cloud Hall was.</p>

  <p>It was also the reason the practitioners dared not to offend the Cloud Hall disciples even though they were more powerful than them.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall disciple was stunned to see his arm cut off. He covered the wound with his hand and shouted, gritting his teeth, "How dare you cut off my arm! I..."</p>

  <p>But before he could continue, Luo Luo Zheng had thrust his Streamer Sword at him and pricked the skin between his eyebrows. A few drops of blood oozed out from the wound.</p>

  <p>"I'm not in the mood to listen to your nonsense! I have heard too much and I'm tired of it. So, if you dare to speak one word more, you're dead!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blankly said.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the Cloud Hall disciple began to shiver. Since he was able to enter the cloud road, he should have outranked the ordinary disciples of Cloud Hall and Luo Luo Zheng for that matter. However, at that moment, he couldn't stop his body from trembling.</p>

  <p>The other Cloud Hall disciple remained quiet. It would only need a short time to set his companion's broken arm and heal the wound, but he couldn't use this arm to perform his skills in a long time.</p>

  <p>After putting his sword back into the sheath and stuffing it into the space ring, Luo Luo Zheng walked to the path beside the platform. All the practitioners watched him leave with eyes filled with awe.</p>

  <p>But until now, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't even used any powerful skills. In reality, many of the practitioners present at the platform were also skillful, but they didn't dare to step up to the Cloud Hall disciples.</p>
