  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fox girl stared up at Luo Zheng with a faint smile. "Actually, there is something that you don't need to know so clearly."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scoffed. "Are you willing to just be a chess piece?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>The fox girl tutted but there was a trace of envy in her eyes as she looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Even so, you're the most important chess piece," she told him.</p>

  <p>In fact, not many people were qualified to become chess pieces in the game in the first place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, found no honor in this. "I don't want to be a chess piece," he said. "I want to be the player." "The player," the fox girl repeated with a smile. "Those who played chess and those who watched by the sidelines have all died. There is no player now. Nobody can control you. It's all up to you."</p>

  <p>She was able to get the knowledge of the Four Spirits Sect from the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"The chaos was never the main battlefield but just a lucky survivor of the fiercer wars that occurred outside it. The war within the Four Spirit Sect, however, will ultimately affect the chaos so it must continue in another way.</p>

  <p>You are the key figure on one side of this war," she explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had an idea which side it was. "The side of the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>She nodded in confirmation. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Of course, even if she didn't tell Luo Zheng, he and the Primeval Lord of Heaven would be able to reach the same conclusion through deduction.</p>

  <p>However, there was one more thing Luo Zheng wanted to know. "Who is the leader of the opposite side?"</p>

  <p>The fox girl merely shrugged. "I have no idea. The brush-wielder has hidden this information for his reasons. Don't think about it too much.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I'll be sending you out..."</p>

  <p>As they followed the path drawn by the brush-wielder, the fox girl and Luo Zheng eventually returned to the edge of the third page. Since the Eternal Scroll Painting had already closed, it meant that this passageway was now closed.</p>

  <p>However, since everything here was controlled by the brush-wielder, it wasn't too difficult for him to open up a temporary exit.</p>

  <p>Since the closing of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the entire Grand Plain Stage had returned to its former peace though the aura of killing intent was heavy in the air.</p>

  <p>A piece of news floated about: the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race were finally able to grasp the method of descent and were now able to transfer the battlefield to the chaos.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A light column fell from the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting that floated in the air, and smashed onto the bronze ground of the Grand Plain Stage, where the Three Purities Stones were situated.</p>

  <p>It was only a flash of light but it attracted attention just the same. Many Other Shore creatures quickly gathered around the area to check what exactly was going on.</p>

  <p>As he moved his body around, Luo Zheng felt a sort of connection. When he looked back at his statues on the Three Purities Stone, he felt that he was connected to them by blood.</p>

  <p>Through the anchor bodies, Luo Zheng was able to connect to the power from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng crawled out of the bronze ground, he found a few creatures scattered about, their eyes wide with shock as they looked at him.</p>

  <p>"It's that human!"</p>

  <p>"He's not dead! Does this mean that he also reached the Eternal Realm?"</p>

  <p>"I have to go back and report this!"</p>

  <p>Before the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, Luo Zheng managed to leave a deep impression onto the Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage. Even those who were on the neutral side began to attach great importance to him.</p>

  <p>A few of the creatures intended to report this matter to their respective leaders right away while a couple of them decided to approach Luo Zheng first and ask him what happened.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had no time to answer their inquiries. He was too worried about the Taiyi Heaven Palace, so without any pause, he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>From above, a lightning dragon appeared and nose-dived to the ground before it disappeared without a trace. Soon enough, the land within a ten thousand-mile radius from where it disappeared turned a charred black.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Terrifying lighting broke through the earth as huge rocks and mountains were thrown into the air along with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked very miserable. The Grandmaster of Heaven was one of the biggest crises they'd ever met.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A mountain soared past them under the force of lighting and blocked the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Fuxi circled his hands and the Eight Diagrams disk rotated above his head.</p>

  <p>"Help me!" he shouted desperately. The Snake Goddess nodded.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>She sat cross-legged in midair and a shadow that mirrored the same gesture appeared behind her.</p>

  <p>Energy beams emanated from her and turned into thin needles that stabbed towards Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Once the needles pierced into Fuxi's body, the shadow of Snake Goddess quickly deflated.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A flash of red light glinted in Fuxi's eyes and the Eight Diagrams disk above him rotated at an impossibly fast rate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Fuxi's aura began to increase dramatically!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's face also flashed with a fierce expression as the power of her bloodline also served and replenished her shadow's energy.</p>

  <p>This secret technique served to enhance Fuxi's strength.</p>

  <p>Drawing out the power of her bloodline would cause great damage to her but it was worth it if it meant that they would get out of this alive.</p>

  <p>Her face paled and aged in a manner of seconds while her eyes, which used to be filled with wisdom, also dimmed.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the purple lightning split the mountain, the Grandmaster of Heaven reappeared.</p>

  <p>He gave them a sinister smile. "You should be proud for having resisted this long, however, this is your last..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his words, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his body.</p>

  <p>This mark was surrounded by a circle of ominous, blood-red light.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Fuxi bid his time and now, the power of his palm had increased several times especially with the Snake Goddess's help.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's body flew away upon contact with Fuxi's overpowered palm.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fuxi knew one strike wasn't going to defeat him. "Again!"</p>

  <p>He and the Snake Goddess quickly teleported and reappeared above the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Another blood-red mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his body. In such a passive position, the Grandmaster of Heaven reflexively raised Luo Zheng's body on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The mark of Eight Diagrams was then transferred to Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Just as Fuxi was about to deal his attack, he stopped upon seeing the mark on Luo Zheng's body. The Snake Goddess behind him frowned at the sight of this.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Zheng's body undergone a new change? How did this happen?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body had previously been a black hole that sucked in any sort of energy laid on him. Since the mark of Eight Diagrams was also a type of energy, it should've been absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>How did it end up imprinted on his body? Could he no longer absorb energy?</p>

  <p>A trace of confusion also appeared in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes.</p>

  <p>He had personally come for Luo Zheng and he wouldn't want to see him die in Fuxi's hands.</p>

  <p>As he thought about it for a while, the Grandmaster of Heaven decided to throw Luo Zheng into his Fishing Drum where he had also previously thrown the Chaos Ancient God named Othniel.</p>

  <p>This Fishing Drum was a spatial treasure filled with the power of space and Luo Zheng should have been able to absorb the power within it due to his special body.</p>

  <p>However, since he had lost this ability now, he would naturally be absorbed into the Fishing Drum.</p>
