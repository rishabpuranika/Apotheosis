<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tentacles lashed around wildly for quite a long time before finally settling.</p>

  <p>Light could swallow up all the creatures of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Even though the tentacles could regenerate, they still couldn't afford to lose that much energy.</p>

  <p>"The creatures of the Dark Region... They're more fragile than I thought,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>The fruits of the black and white tree proved extremely beneficial. After eating the Darkness Fruits, both he and Feng Ge were granted the ability of adapting to the Dark Region's environment.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Dark Region creatures ate the Light Fruits, then they would be able to adapt to the outside world.</p>

  <p>However, the three-eyed boy and the huge ape could only adapt to the candlelight and were unable to leave.</p>

  <p>"If the creatures of the Dark Region weren't afraid of light, then they would have ruled the Other Shore," Feng Ge said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only nod in agreement. "I can't refute that."</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Other Shore were much stronger than the Souls of Light, but the creatures here in the Dark Region were far stronger than those on the Other Shore. If the Dark Region's inhabitants had the ability to walk freely in the light, then they would be an unstoppable force.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where the light is coming from?" Luo Zheng muttered to himself as he looked directly up to the sky.</p>

  <p>Darkness was everywhere save for that one strange hole above them where light filtered through, bathing them with illuminated safety.</p>

  <p>He would've never believed such a place existed if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>"I just want to know if we can get out of here," Feng Ge told him. She too couldn't help but gaze at that strange light that shone above them.</p>

  <p>With a weary sigh, Feng Ge then began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Illusion Breaking Rune broke through the illusions, Feng Ge's Soul of Light began to dissipate. She flashed Luo Zheng a cold smile, no longer sad and weary, just before fully fading in the wind.</p>

  <p>"She really left," Luo Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>Standing there alone, he felt the weak power of his Other Shore Tokens in his body. He figured that perhaps it would be best if he also left the Other Shore and replenished his power.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he made that decision, the pig-faced monsters around the light column stepped aside.</p>

  <p>One of them, a dark blue one, walked towards Luo Zheng and stopped just by the edge of the light column.</p>

  <p>This one raised its hand and silence immediately fell amongst its peers.</p>

  <p>"Human friend from outside the Dark Region," the pig-faced monster greeted in a very polite tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng previously had no interest in these monsters.</p>

  <p>However, this change of attitude was very much welcome.</p>

  <p>He and Feng Ge had been safe within the light column but it was only a temporary sanctuary. Now that Feng Ge had gone back to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Luo Zheng figured that he now had to find a way out for both of them on his own.</p>

  <p>He smiled at the pig-faced monster. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monster huffed as it looked at Luo Zheng. "Can you come out of the holy tomb?" it asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "No."</p>

  <p>He wasn't stupid. Walking out of the light column would mean instant death.</p>

  <p>"This is our holy tomb, a sacred place to our kind. We hold it in the highest reverence. Your presence here offends us," the pig-faced monster insisted.</p>

  <p>The young man couldn't help but roll his eyes. He and Feng Ge didn't mean to intrude into anyone's sacred place. They were just seeking a safe place from those black monkeys. Luo Zheng could only look at the pig-faced monster with a wry smile. "What do you want me to do then?"</p>

  <p>"Can you come out of the holy tomb?" the pig-faced monster repeated. Luo Zheng pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration.</p>

  <p>Despite having the ability to speak the human language, it didn't seem as if the pig-faced monster was very intelligent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heaved a sigh, looking at the strange monsters that were trying to kick him out of their holy tomb. "Bye."</p>

  <p>That was the last thing he said before he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune. As he murmured the words, his body started to blur before finally disappearing.</p>

  <p>As soon as he disappeared, the pig-monsters began to curse loudly. Vulgar atrocities spilled from their lips, especially the leader's.</p>

  <p>In the Phoenix Palace, there was a huge magic array.</p>

  <p>This array was quite special-looking as it emitted a faint golden glow. A body sat in the middle.</p>

  <p>Soon, the light emanating from it grew more intense and golden flames began to lick at the array, releasing a terrifying burst of energy.</p>

  <p>This energy had come from Concubine Yan who was currently controlling the magic array.</p>

  <p>Three old men stood behind her. They were famous powerhouses of the Phoenix Palace and recognized as great masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>One of the three old men stepped forward, a helpless look evident on his face. "Lady Concubine Yan, we've tried it three times already! Given Princess Feng Ge's location, it would be hard to pull her out. The only way we'd be able to do so is if she happens to walk by a place where the energy is weak."</p>

  <p>In the Source World, there were some methods of forcing people out of the Other Shore. Although the Soul Binding Thread could trap people on the Other Shore, they could be forcefully pulled out.</p>

  <p>However, the power of the Grand Sky Temple and the Dark Region was so great that even if Concubine Yan set up an array, she still failed to wake Feng Ge up.</p>

  <p>"Contribute your soul power!" she ordered, the determination on her face never fading.</p>

  <p>She knew Feng Ge was fine, but the reactions Feng Ge had recently worried her.</p>

  <p>As soon as she said this, Feng Ge's body, which had been sitting in the middle of the array, slightly trembled. Fear crossed her sleeping features and she was shaking as if she was afraid of something.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan was in distress. She didn't know what her daughter was currently going through for her to have reacted this way.</p>

  <p>"It's not a problem to contribute our soul power. What we're worried about is Princess Feng Ge! Our combined soul power might be too strong and she might not be able to withstand it!" another old man said with a pleading voice.</p>

  <p>If they did as Concubine Yan said, then they might accidentally tear Feng Ge's soul apart.</p>

  <p>"We won't know unless we try! She's so weak. She might die on the Other Shore at any moment!" Concubine Yan raged.</p>

  <p>As soon as the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace returned, they immediately headed to Concubine Yan and gave her a full report of the situation.</p>

  <p>She was well aware of the dangers they had faced and there was no way she was letting her daughter stay one more minute in that place.</p>

  <p>Under Concubine Yan's strict orders, the three old men had no choice but to obey.</p>

  <p>The magic array was reactivated and Concubine Yan released the divine flames of the Jin Wu to control it.</p>

  <p>However, at that exact moment, Feng Ge suddenly opened her eyes!</p>

  <p>"Mother?" she exclaimed in surprise, seeing Concubine Yan and the three old men before her.</p>

  <p>All concentration Concubine Yan had flew right out of the window the moment she heard her daughter's voice. With a trembling lip, she ran towards the magic array and swooped down to take Feng Ge in her arms.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mother," Feng Ge murmured.</p>

  <p>This apology sparked something in Concubine Yan's heart.</p>

  <p>The mother and daughter pair did not really get along well with each other.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge always showed indifference and sometimes even hostility to her mother.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan never expected her to apologize like this after returning from the Dark Region.</p>
