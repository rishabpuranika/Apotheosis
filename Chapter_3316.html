<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3316 Feng Ge's Impaired Memory </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge now possessed a body on the Other Shore. Luo Zheng could recognize her at a glance by her thick black hair and her eyes that were as deep as ancient pools.</p>

  <p>When the woman heard the name 'Feng Ge', she fell into a trance as her mind began searching for an answer to the meaning of this name.</p>

  <p>The name seemed to be hers, but she couldn't recall if it was.</p>

  <p>The man in front of her was familiar and intimate as well, but who was he?</p>

  <p>She was enraged on seeing the Green Jade Beast had caught hold of the man. "Beast! Stay away from him!" she screeched terrifyingly.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast felt threatened by the woman and unleashed a great roar. It did not want to provoke her, but it wouldn't let go of Luo Zheng either.</p>

  <p>It grabbed Luo Zheng with a front paw and scaled the mountain wall at the back of the valley. It might have been enormous, but it moved as agile as a kitten.</p>

  <p>The woman remained deep in thought. She felt overbearingly uneasy as she watched the man being taken by the Green Jade Beast but she didn't know why.</p>

  <p>Driven by pure instinct, her arm raised up slowly and a ball of light began gathering in her hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The light rays began swirling and dancing around. Then, a white light shot at the Green Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast and nimble it was, it could not escape the light.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>A puff of black smoke rose from the body of the Green Jade Beast as the light hit it. Its once smooth skin now became mottled and dotted with holes all over.</p>

  <p>"Woo!"</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast let out a miserable cry and slid down from the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Kill that gigantic beast!"</p>

  <p>"Come on, Master Teague!"</p>

  <p>"That beast slaughtered more than half of our race!"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters lucky enough to survive shouted while hiding in the corner of the valley.</p>

  <p>They didn't know who this woman was, but they figured she must be the purified being if she was able to control the light as she did. Some of them regarded her as Teague.</p>

  <p>Just as the Green Jade Beast was about to fall into the valley, its back shuddered. Suddenly, a fresh pair of wings spread out, allowing it to fly up.</p>

  <p>This didn't faze the woman much. Her eyes flashed and she raised her hand to point at the Green Jade Beast. Within split seconds, countless thick light columns rained down on it.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast's wings made it even more agile and flexible.</p>

  <p>Dragging a dark green shadow, it flew between the light columns with ease.</p>

  <p>The body of the Green Jade Beast was much thicker than that of an ordinary physical body. It could sustain the occasional blow of light without serious injury. Like a butterfly fluttering among the flowers, the beast swiveled in, out and around the light columns before it rushed straight towards the woman.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge! Look out!" Luo Zheng warned at the top of his lungs as he and the Green Jade Beast dashed down together.</p>

  <p>If Feng Ge was hit by the gigantic beast, she would be smashed into minced meat.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked, her pupils slightly dilated, and a glowing mark of light appeared beneath her feet. She put her tiptoe into the mark, and with a thin smile on her lips, she muttered, "Great Sanskrit Light..."</p>

  <p>This was her instinct. She could summon it at will.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A beam of light as thin as a hair erupted from the light mark beneath her foot into the air.</p>

  <p>"Oh no... It missed!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face saddened as he watched the thin light pass by the Green Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng soon realized how wrong he was. The power Feng Ge controlled was far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>The string of light instantly expanded and formed a dazzling column of light that filled the entire valley in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The light column caused everything in the valley to vanish into thin air. The stones, the leaves, the caves and the pig-faced monsters had all disappeared.</p>

  <p>It continued to expand wildly, causing the mountain walls at both ends of the valley and the cliffs and mountains nearby to disappear too.</p>

  <p>This scene left all the creatures lurking in the Dark Region ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Has the purified being of Stage Thirteen been born?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's coming from where the pig-faced monsters live."</p>

  <p>"Humph, they must be supported by the Blood Assembly. Otherwise, how could a purified being appear among those idiots?"</p>

  <p>The light column was tens of thousands of feet in diameter and beamed a few seconds more before it gradually dimmed.</p>

  <p>The whole valley, as well as the surrounding mountains had disappeared, and a huge crater was left on the ground.</p>

  <p>But the tomb, the tombstone and the dark cave under the tombstone were still intact, standing where they were alone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched his arms out and pushed himself off the ground.</p>

  <p>The bronze iron plates had disappeared into the strong light and Luo Zheng was free.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why hasn't the beast disappeared? How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eye, Luo Zheng noticed something greenish on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was the Green Jade Beast, but it was only the size of a fist now.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast must be from the Dark Region. Logically speaking, it should disappear into the light without a trace. Why it had remained and shrunk to this size puzzled Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He reached out and picked it up. It felt cold, as if it was not a living thing and more like a jade stone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng studied the Green Jade Beast in his hand when a light flashed in front of him. Feng Ge had appeared.</p>

  <p>"What did you call me just now?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge," Luo Zheng replied with a frown.</p>

  <p>She tilted her head, looked at Luo Zheng innocently and asked, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed in his heart at Feng Ge's question.</p>

  <p>When he was grabbed by the tentacles, the white shadow had already rushed to Feng Ge's Soul of Light. There was nothing Luo Zheng could do back then. He imagined Feng Ge's Soul of Light would probably be devoured by the white shadow.</p>

  <p>But things had not gone that way at all.</p>

  <p>Perhaps something unexpected happened when the white shadow had tried to devour Feng Ge's soul; it failed and Feng Ge's Memory Flame prevailed over it.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's Soul of Light and memory were both damaged.</p>

  <p>"My name is  Luo Zheng Luo," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo..." Feng Ge repeated in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and asked, "Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge nodded and said seriously, "Yes."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at her strangely and asked, "What do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Feng Ge pounced on Luo Zheng, embracing him and looking into his eyes tenderly. She would never have acted like this or even looked at him like this before.</p>

  <p>"I remember that I seem to like you very much," she said sweetly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was frozen.</p>

  <p>He knew her memory was a mess but that was the last thing he had expected.</p>
