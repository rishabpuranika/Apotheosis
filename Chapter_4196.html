<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4196 The Door Opened </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This altar was huge and exquisite-looking.</p>

  <p>The outermost circle was paved with a layer of white jade. It was so white and pale that it looked like it was swimming in a layer of milk.</p>

  <p>The outer wall was inlaid with a layer of cyan gray stone bricks, the surfaces of which were engraved with multiple Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had deciphered many of these Sanskrit words that recorded the glorious deeds of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>On getting close to the wall, Luo Zheng activated the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization and tried to decipher a few Sanskrit words. The information he learned was on the lines of what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had told him. It mainly pertained to the origin of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>This altar had originally been built by Campbell and his fellows, so the fact that the Sanskrit words were here wasn't completely out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>They walked along the length of the altar for a distance before they spotted a staircase that led to the top floor.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord turned to look at the altar a few times, a strange expression on his face. "As far as I know, the Snake Spirit King attaches great importance to this place. He usually sends Treacherous Beings to guard it. But why is there no Treacherous Being guarding the altar today?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around but shrugged and shook his head. "I don't know. Let's go up there first."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng led the way as the group made their way up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The huge altar itself wasn't anything magical. It only had a thousand stairs, and Luo Zheng and his companions could climb these in a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>A smooth plane sat at the top of the altar, at the center of which was a square opening. Beside this were steps that extended into the altar.</p>

  <p>"Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, I'm confused," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked.</p>

  <p>"Does the Snake Spirit King want something in the altar?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord thought for a moment before nodding and saying, "I think he is eager to enter the altar."</p>

  <p>According to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, it was very likely that Kincaid was locked in the altar.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit King, in the Four Spirits Sect, was kind enough to remain neutral. The Monkey Spirit King was powerful, but he was reckless. Only Kincaid and the human spirits were the strongest opponents of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"In that case, why doesn't he break the altar?" Luo Zheng asked, confused.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "I don't know," he said.</p>

  <p>"I think there are a few possibilities," said the Snake Goddess. "One, this altar is special, and the Snake Spirit King can't open it. Two, it might need a unique way to open it, and using brute force will cause loss. Three, it could also be that there is something in the altar that the Snake Spirit King is afraid of, which is why he doesn't dare release whatever's in the altar."</p>

  <p>"I don't think your third point is right. After all, the Snake Spirit King has defeated the other three sects. Could anything in the entire chaos scare him?" Gonggong, who was silent all this time, suddenly bit out a retort.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was thoughtful as he responded, "That's not necessarily true. This war is no longer related only to the Four Spirits Sect. Beings of the higher level have now gotten involved. Perhaps someone can restrain the Snake Spirit King..."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, we'll know when we open the altar," said Zhurong.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made to walk down the steps that led into the altar.</p>

  <p>The moment he set foot on the steps, he felt the viscosity of the space below him, as if a strange power of space held rein within this square opening.</p>

  <p>He was confused, but decided not to take it seriously.</p>

  <p>But in the Heavenly Square City that was tens of thousands of miles away from here, the Space Guiding Stone of the Snake Spirit King began to flash.</p>

  <p>"How have they reached the altar so fast?" the Snake Spirit King said, agitated.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Luo Zheng and his group would try to hide from him for a while. He hadn't expected them to go straight to the altar.</p>

  <p>He had originally intended to remove all other obstacles before expecting Luo Zheng to open the altar alone. His goal hadn't been fully achieved, but at least Luo Zheng would open the door of the altar himself.</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>A huge crack sounded from above the Heavenly Square City, blooming through the sky before the city once again shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Gather all the Snake Masters and follow me to the altar." The Snake Spirit King's voice echoed through the space.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters and the Treacherous Beings that had been sent out began to gather at the altar, while the Snake Spirit King personally led the elites of the Heavenly Square City towards it.</p>

  <p>There were more than a thousand steps inside the square opening.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked down, feeling the space to be more viscous than he had expected it to be.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess noticed Luo Zheng's hesitation and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, Luo Zheng stopped and closed his eyes, lost in thought. A few minutes later, he opened his eyes again, now wary. "There is a layer of space enchanted barrier here, a very thin one..."</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Why can't I feel it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't feel it as well!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were confused.</p>

  <p>"I feel it! Just a little though," said the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The Wing King's bloodline talent was related to space, which meant that he was more sensitive to space.</p>

  <p>"This space enchanted barrier is similar to the aura of the Space Guiding Stone," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Has it been set up by the Snake Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Luo Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"That's going to be a problem," Zhurong said, his eyes widening.</p>

  <p>"Let's stay outside to keep an eye on things here and let Luo Zheng get inside," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said decidedly.</p>

  <p>Having come this far, they were now ready to sacrifice themselves.</p>

  <p>Everyone were to stay outside, while Luo Zheng continued to walk down the stairs.</p>

  <p>When he reached the bottom of the stairs, a stone door appeared before him.</p>

  <p>It was simple and crude, as if made of a stone that was cut out by an axe at random, its surface covered in marks.</p>

  <p>At the center of the stone door was a circular metal disk, in the middle of which was a small key hole.</p>

  <p>"This is the door of the altar," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>"This door seems very simple, as if it can be opened with just a push!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "Your strength is far greater than mine, but I don't think you can open this door."</p>

  <p>Back in the day, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had also reached the door and tried all sorts of methods to open the door. He had failed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would obviously not use brute force to open the door. He lifted his wrist gently, causing the Sumeru Space to begin to unfold. A bronze key appeared suddenly.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the key and inserted it into the metal disk.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A voice sounded from the stone door.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>The door was then pushed inward, a gust of cold wind blowing out and a layer of white frost instantly enveloping Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was fine. The blood vitality in his body moved around from within, the white frost having disappeared. He looked inside to find a snake-shaped road made of ice, and countless white light dots floating on both sides of this road.</p>

  <p>"A huge Cold Prison!" Luo Zheng muttered, awed at this sight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen a lot of Cold Prisons in the upper field of the Blooming Jade Stage. But they had been tiny compared to this one.</p>

  <p>The Cold Prison before him was different. Apart from the ice path in the middle, everything else was a part of it. If one didn't look carefully at the dots of light, they would think that they were snowflakes dancing in the air. They couldn't be more wrong.</p>
