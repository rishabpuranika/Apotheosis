  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The black object you obtained in the hidden trail is the soul essence. It did come from the same source as these black objects here. The soul essence is the reason why the Cloud Road has the Dark Devil Phantoms.</p>

  <p>But they have used a secret special method to remove the toxin from the essence of Dark Devil Phantom to make the soul essence," the disciple of Cloud Hall explained coldly.</p>

  <p>"Does it mean that the hundreds of essence of Dark Devil Phantom here could be refined to around ten pieces of soul essence?" Zheng asked. He was caught by the disciple's words and decided to question him after a quick thought.</p>

  <p>If a piece of soul essence could have a little increase in the soul power, it meant that if they could refine ten pieces of soul essence, they could have a considerable increase in the soul power.</p>

  <p>The disciple of Cloud Sect nodded, which indicated that Zheng's assumption was correct.</p>

  <p>All the people's eyes lit up with pleasant surprise after they had heard these comments.</p>

  <p>The Death Road was the biggest hidden barrier on the Cloud Road. The most important reason why people chose to enter it was that they hoped to get great opportunities and benefits on the road, even though it might be very dangerous. They knew that the danger and benefits always went hand in hand.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they started to fight and sometimes, even almost died on the road. However, they hadn't gotten anything good or seen any opportunity, which was the saddest thing for them.</p>

  <p>Thus, they were ecstatic to see so many pieces of essence of Dark Devil Phantom in this place. What a big opportunity for them! Hope filled them like how the sunshine finally shone in a long, dark night.</p>

  <p>Although the essences of Dark Devil Phantom had not been refined, their value after being refined was invaluable because of their effects on the soul strength! Even in the Central Region, pills which could strengthen the soul were rare and mostly were extraordinarily expensive.</p>

  <p>These pills also had heavy side effects. They would increase the soul strength, but they would bring burden to the human body after being swallowed. Some would even generate toxic objects in the human body which were hard to be cleared of.</p>

  <p>However, the soul essence in this place could directly increase the strength of the soul by a big volume. If this was not a big opportunity, what else could be called as a big opportunity?</p>

  <p>A strong soul was good for oneself and did not bring any harm. Those with strong souls could even directly suppress their opponents by their power from the soul with just a thought, even without any movements.</p>

  <p>"Then, how do we allocate them?" Frank asked the most essential question. The disciple of Cloud Sect shook his head without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I don't need them," he said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Frank glanced at the disciple of Cloud Sect. 'This guy knew himself very well. I did not plan to allocate anything to him. It is good that he said that first, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Lois, Patrick, and Lewis remained silent. Everyone would like to have as many as possible of these good things. However, they didn't help just now. So, they also wondered how they would allocate the black objects.</p>

  <p>A smile suddenly appeared on Frank's lips when he noticed that everyone kept silent. "I have a proposal. How about 30% to Zheng? He made great efforts to get the essence. Then 20% to Tianming, and Lois, Patrick and I evenly split the rest?" he said.</p>

  <p>"How about me?" Lewis asked as his face visibly darkened. Even though he wasn't that brave, he wasn't bad when it came to strength. Frank's proposal left him out, which made him angry.</p>

  <p>However, Frank didn't seem to notice his dark face.</p>

  <p>"Except for running away, what else did you do? Why do we need to give anything to you?" Frank sneered coldly.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious? Do you think that because you're Frank, you can talk nonsense?"</p>

  <p>Lewis' voice suddenly changed. It looked like he was replaced by someone else in a split second. His voice became muffled and powerful, and his eyes shone like two glittering rubies.</p>

  <p>Lewis' strength wasn't bad, because he had the dual soul in his body! The second soul was much stronger and did not appear in most of situations unless awakened. If Lewis had called out this stronger soul in the second layer of the hidden trial, he would have gotten the treasure box there.</p>

  <p>However, he chose not to do that, and he didn't have the chance to go back to the second layer after he had fallen from the cliff.</p>

  <p>However, Frank sneered again when he saw the change in Lewis. His white spear suddenly appeared in his hand. "It seems that you have concealed your actual strength before. That makes sense. Anyone who dares to enter the Death Road should have some special strengths.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, you would've died like Zade," he said in an icy tone. He added, "Anyway, what you did before doesn't matter. Now, do you want to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised by these people here. They had all showed their optimum strength before him one by one. Tianming was the first, followed by Zheng. Now, even the timid Lewis had his own secret power. It seemed that Frank had underestimated them before. There were no weak people here!</p>

  <p>"If you do not change the allocation plan, of course I would challenge you!" Lewis declared. After he said those words, he pulled out a wide machete with a thorny back from his black cloak.</p>

  <p>When Tianming saw that they were about to fight, he quickly went to stop them. "That's enough! Frank, your allocation plan is ridiculous, not to mention that Lewis isn't satisfied. Even Zheng and I do not agree with you!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>It was Frank's face that had darkened now.</p>

  <p>He thought that he was the authority in the team, but now he felt that he had lost control of this temporary group. Or maybe, they had never considered him to be the leader in the first place. They simply didn't think there was a need for one. It had been Frank's own thought all the way.</p>

  <p>The loss of control made Frank uneasy. As far as he was concerned, such kind of supreme talent like he should be the born leader. He was the one who made decisions every time when he took adventures with other disciples of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, two people had expressed their disagreement when he said his plan. That had never happened before!</p>

  <p>The air was tense among them. Zheng glanced at Frank and said, "Tianming and I have eliminated the Dark Devil Phantoms here. I only need 50% of them."</p>

  <p>"And I need 20% of them. You can split the balance among yourselves,"</p>

  <p>Tianming followed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Patrick didn't say anything. However, he agreed more with Zheng's plan. Whoever contributed the most efforts should be given the most. They would all have been killed if it weren't for Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>In that case, nothing was to be allocated.</p>
