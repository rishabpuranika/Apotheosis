<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's destiny was obviously too good! Even Elder Xu felt jealous in his heart. Normally, with his powerful strength and temperament as a high-level refiner, he could have dealt with any unexpected case in front of him calmly. Someone had even joked that he would not have blinked his eyes even when the mountains fell down. But this time, Elder Xu could not maintain his calmness. Such a supreme talent and luck had made nearly everyone feel jealous.</p>

  <p>Even someone as calm as Patrick also felt surprised to see Luo Zheng's progress. His eyes sparkled and when he saw the sword spirit, he sprang out of his meditation. Normally, the essential condition of cultivating Buddhist method was to stay calm and hold an even temper. Patrick had a very fine temper and could be considered an outstanding Buddhist refiner. However, he could not keep his usual calm nature at this moment.</p>

  <p>His story just now was like a monk who had chanted sutras all day long and lived a regular life. He would wake up in the morning with the sound of the bell in his temple and end his day after hearing the pounding of the drums. He would care the least about the wealth, relationship and love in the world. Buddhism was his whole life. He was sincere in his prayers and hoped that one day he could inherit Buddhism. But one day, his quiet life was broken. A small monk had come to the temple and it had not taken him long time to come across Buddha and receive the inheritance from Buddha.</p>

  <p>So, on encountering this kind of thing, Patrick could only laugh bitterly and at the same time, secretly scolded in his heart, 'Fuck! This is unfair.'</p>

  <p>Besides, Tracy was also pestering Patrick, continuously barraging him with questions, "Patrick, what on earth is that? I feel that she is not a real human! How could this woman appear so suddenly?"</p>

  <p>Owing to her divine legendary beast blood, Tracy's instinct was sensing that Lily wasn't human and might be special. She could identify that Lily was not a real human, but she could not know what Lily actually was.</p>

  <p>"That is a sword spirit!" Patrick was getting a little impatient by her nonstop inquiries and told her directly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Sensing his impatient mood, Tracy pouted her lips. She did not know why Patrick was unhappy. How could he be unhappy? The sword spirit was not a special thing that they had never heard of before.</p>

  <p>How could it make Patrick's temper short? Hmmm!</p>

  <p>Back inside the fighting field, Tianming had just condensed his own Extreme Thunder Sword Intent and had been very proud of that. But when he saw the appearance of Luo Zheng's sword spirit, he could not help it and a shiver ran across his whole body. People who did not know exactly what had happened to him would have thought that he had received an electric shock by his own thunder.</p>

  <p>Then he just forced a weak smile on his face. That was a very, very bitter smile. He shook his head and remarked weakly, "I thought it was very lucky for me to meditate and form the thunder intent in the Sword Washing Pool, which let me combine it to my sword intent. After all, the famous Sword Washing Pool is an area where no one from the Eastern Region has ever been lucky enough to be allowed to enter for thousands of years. I was really happy and proud to come across this lucky chance.</p>

  <p>But I have never thought that you were able to condense your sword spirit and even form a human-shape out of it!" Tianming took a deep breath to calm himself down after this long speech.</p>

  <p>His words cast a light to most of the disciples. Only after his explanation did they actually understand what had happened inside the arena.</p>

  <p>"Sword spirit! That woman beside Luo Luo Zheng is his sword spirit! Is that true? I cannot believe my ears!"</p>

  <p>"But that is totally, utterly, impossible. I remember reading in a book of sword refinement. There were some records about the sword spirit in there. It said that after reaching the consummate sword intent, the sword refiner could form his sword spirit. But it can take at least three to five years if everything goes smoothly. And moreover, it can often take up to dozens of years to form it into human shape. Some sword refiners never get to form their sword spirit even after they have got the consummate sword intent!"</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding? Is your book about some false refining method? Luo Luo Zheng just meditated the consummate sword intent for a couple of hours, and now, you can see that he has a sword spirit by his side!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet. That is the record in the book. I suppose, the record would not be wrong. I think what happened is that Luo Luo Zheng has refreshed the record in the book. He might even have broken it and set a new one!"</p>

  <p>No wonder that they were all so confused. Luo Luo Zheng had directly transformed his sword spirit into a human-shaped one, which had shocked even the cyan dragon in his mind. The cyan dragon had lived for a long time. So long that no one knew exactly how old the cyan dragon was. In his eons of life span, the dragon had witnessed so many outstanding refiners or special events but had never seen someone condensing his spirit so fast into human shape. If even the dragon was stunned, it would clearly be even harder for the people of the Eastern Region to accept the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had condensed the sword spirit and then formed a human shape from it in only a few hours. So, Luo Luo Zheng had really broken the record in the book.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, the place where I practiced the consummate sword intent is Sword Washing Pool, which is a semi-sacred region. Would you mind telling me where you have been? What did you experience there?" Tianming asked out his doubts and then added hastily, "It would be fine if you think that is confidential."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. In his mind, there was nothing confidential regarding the place where he had got the consummate sword intent. He answered directly, "A mountain. It is called the Killing Sword Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Killing Sword Mountain!" Tianming's eyes narrowed into slits in shock.</p>

  <p>The Sword Washing Pool could only be considered as a semi-sacred site.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of sacred sites much above the Sword Washing Pool. As far as Tianming could remember, the Killing Sword Mountain, the Tidal Sword Tomb and the Heavenly Sword Tablet were the top three sacred sites for practicing sword skills.</p>

  <p>If he could choose, he would have most likely selected the Heavenly Sword Tablet, which was the best fit for his Heavenly Sword cultivation method. He would have been able to gain more if he had practiced his sword intent there. However, he did not have a choice. It all depended on his fate. It was always sacred sites which chose a person, and not the other way around. He, Tianming, was not qualified at all!</p>

  <p>"You are too strong, Luo Luo Zheng. I thought that I might not be as strong as Patrick before, but I always believe that I could catch up with him one day. But you, Luo Luo Zheng, you are the first person whom I don't have the confidence that I can catch up with." Tianming murmured, with a sad look in his face. "However," he kept speaking, "there are too many talents in this world. The number is too big for me to imagine. Maybe I can be considered a genius in the Eastern Region but nothing in the Central Region! But I want to catch up with you. Even if I cannot keep pace with you, my efforts will help me achieve more progress!"</p>

  <p>If he could not catch up with a genius, then he would probably follow the genius' steps closely.</p>

  <p>It was not hard to figure out that Tianming had a good temperament. At least, he was not driven mad by jealousy and had not generated a private demon in his heart, which would have definitely blocked his road of refinement.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, even though I know it is hard for me to win, I still want to continue our fight! I will insist on my sword refinement and will never give up!" After saying that, he raised his Blood-corroding Sword. He summoned his life vitality to drive the thunder and lightning flow around his sword and displayed the consummate sword intent. In this way, he stabbed at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
