  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now, Chance had to hit the sculpture over ten times to destroy it.</p>

  <p>Deafening, clanging sounds echoed as his sword strikes collided with the sculpture.</p>

  <p>He cut the sculpture a dozen times before it finally broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the sculpture crumbled, a new one appeared before him. Zheng had summoned another statue.</p>

  <p>It was even burlier and larger than the last one!</p>

  <p>"The sculptures will just keep coming!" Chance said to himself, getting frustrated.</p>

  <p>He realized that it was a mistake to waste his energy on the statues. He should have dodged them and directly attacked Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>He sidestepped the latest statue and prepared to rush towards Zheng. In that instant, a chessboard appeared in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Like the statues, it was made of Regal Jade.</p>

  <p>Nine vertical and nine horizontal lines were laid out on the chessboard, forming a total of eighty-one intersections.</p>

  <p>There was a single cyan chessman on the board.</p>

  <p>Zheng delicately placed a finger on the cyan chessman, and pushed it a step forward.</p>

  <p>The statue sprang to life. It lunged forward and grabbed Chance.</p>

  <p>Chance was caught by surprise when the statue took hold of him. He had thought the statues were only used to make the array, and that they couldn't move.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Chance shouted. At this point he was more irritated than afraid.</p>

  <p>He had stopped not because he was afraid but trying to save his time and strength.</p>

  <p>If he wanted, he would be able to destroy them one after another.</p>

  <p>As the statue dragged him, Chance turned, wielding his sword. The light of his sword circled as he swung at the statue.</p>

  <p>There was a crashing sound as it cracked and crumbled.</p>

  <p>He had broken the statue into pieces with his sword.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Phoenix Palace cheered, "Chance is awesome!"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen anything like that strange Other Shore Token, but it won't be enough to beat Chance!"</p>

  <p>While the disciples were proclaiming their support for Chance, one of them suddenly pointed at Zheng and gasped, "Look!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was holding the Regal Jade chessboard with one hand. He raised his other hand, and immediately another statue of Regal Jade Beast appeared beside him. It was huge and forbidding. It was definitely taller and fiercer than any of the previous statues.</p>

  <p>They could see traces of green energy surrounding the Regal Jade Beast statue.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. Although he was just standing there, not saying anything, there was something subtly threatening about the way he touched the piece on the chessboard.</p>

  <p>The moment that Chance had smashed the last statue, the cyan chessman on the board also crumbled and fell apart.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng gently pushed another chessman forward, and the statue beside him rushed straight towards Chance.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to conclude which type of Other Shore Token the Civilization Artifact was. It had various characteristics, including features of descending type, strengthening type, mysterious type, and even auxiliary type.</p>

  <p>In order to evade the Nihility race, the Regal Jade Civilization had suppressed some of their power by hiding on Stage Thirteen. Yet it could still give Zheng a terrifying force in the form of this chessboard, which was able to summon statues of Regal Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>Each time Zheng summoned a statue, it would be more powerful than the statue before it. Thus the more frequently he summoned a statue, the stronger it would become.</p>

  <p>However, the chessboard had one important flaw? it required a huge consumption of the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't wanted to use the Civilization Artifact in this fight.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Chance had left him with no other choice.</p>

  <p>As the statue attacked Chance, Zheng waved his hand again. Along with the new chessman on the board, another enormous statue appeared beside him.</p>

  <p>Zheng touched the chessman and the new statue also rushed towards Chance.</p>

  <p>At the sight of two statues attacking him, Chance began to feel a trace of fear.</p>

  <p>He realized that every new statue was stronger than the last one. And he had no idea how many of these Zheng could summon. Perhaps Zheng had an endless array of these statues at his disposal.</p>

  <p>The last destroyed statue had been the twelfth one, and it had eight hundred divine megatons of force. As Chance prepared to attack the two new statues, he wondered how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>The moment they came close, he knew the answer.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth statue had nine hundred divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>And the fourteenth one had one thousand divine megatons of force!</p>

  <p>The power of the statues was increasing by one hundred divine megatons with each iteration. At the same time, they were becoming harder and taller.</p>

  <p>Chance's sword clanged as he darted forward, slashing at the two statues.</p>

  <p>He was thankful that the moving statues were very slow. They were unable to match his speed. Despite the force of his numerous attacks on these two statues, he only managed to cut off a few pieces of jade.</p>

  <p>Ahmad and the other disciples could see that Chance was having a difficult time, and they exchanged confused glances.</p>

  <p>The descending type of Other Shore Token was very powerful, in part because the owner did not need to bear the force. But it also had a limitation. It could not grow with the owner. So most of the ambitious people of the Other Shore Realm would never choose this kind of Other Shore Token for themselves.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's statues were incredibly strong.</p>

  <p>The guards of the Phoenix Palace also stood nearby, watching the battle between Zheng and Chance.</p>

  <p>Many of them used to be Oneness Guards. They were powerful and experienced.</p>

  <p>At first, like the Phoenix Palace disciples, they had believed there was no doubt Chance would win.</p>

  <p>After all, he was from the Land of Sword Grief!</p>

  <p>But with every new statue that appeared, each one stronger than the statue before it, they began to feel uneasy. They felt that Chance actually had a chance of being defeated.</p>

  <p>"There's no way he can just keep summoning as many statues as he wants.</p>

  <p>There has to be a limit."</p>

  <p>"But we don't know that! For all we know, he could keep summoning new statues infinitely."</p>

  <p>"If the strength and numbers of the statues keep increasing, they may overturn this entire place," said one of the guards solemnly.</p>

  <p>The other guards stared at him, shaking their heads.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>"Other Shore Tokens can be extremely powerful, but they have to be reasonable. Remember, that guy has only reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. There's no way he could have gotten his hands on an invincible Other Shore Token."</p>

  <p>Of course, the power of the Other Shore Tokens did not always strictly correspond to their stage. There were powerful tokens in Stage One, and there were tokens from Stage Thirteen that could be stronger than tokens from Stage Fourteen. But the variance in their level of power would not be too great.</p>

  <p>There were some Other Shore Tokens that had the power to overturn the Oneness Sky Palace, but there was no way they would be found in Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Chance shouted furiously. His hair stood on end with his exertions.</p>

  <p>A primitive and unique force began forming inside his body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a melodious bell sounded.</p>

  <p>"His blood!" cried the disciples.</p>

  <p>"Chance's blood is pure.</p>

  <p>He has just summoned the Bell of Eastern Emperor!"</p>

  <p>Chance raised his sword slightly and said, "Suppress." He swept his sword across the two statues, and shadows appeared over each of them. Two huge bells were falling from the sky.</p>

  <p>There was a clanging sound as the bells landed.</p>

  <p>The two statues were broken into pieces in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Chance triumphantly.</p>

  <p>He looked at Zheng, intending to gloat, but instead he saw something terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zheng still wore that faint smile. Next to him stood three statues. Each was taller and stronger than the two statues Chance had just destroyed.</p>
