  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thought that the corpse of the immortal Mist was placed in the coffin, but he didn't expect that the coffin was filled with an abundant amount of treasures, and they would be used as rewards for those who had passed the Wheel of Fortune...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt very strange about such arrangement.</p>

  <p>The celestial tomb had been built by Mist in order to lure warriors from the Central Region and he should have realized that, technically, the warriors that were to be lured would basically be tomb robbers. Luo Zheng was, technically, a tomb robber.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't really figure out how Mist's mind worked. He did not directly kill tomb robbers that came for his treasures but instead he used the Wheel of Fortune to test their luck and awarded the winners.</p>

  <p>"Why reward us? The main reason everyone came here was to rob your tomb," Luo Zheng asked, disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>The immortal Mist snorted, "I specialize in Karma," he declared knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Sowing good seeds brings forth good fortune. All of you here were lured in by me and some have even died in the Wheel of Fortune because of that.</p>

  <p>It's only right I give away proper compensation."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't quite agree. Mist claimed to have studied and specialized in Karma, then shouldn't their compensation be death since they all came here with the ill intent of robbing the celestial tomb? Luo Zheng shrugged. It was Mist's decision and he shouldn't really interfere. Besides, there were treasures awaiting to be chosen.</p>

  <p>He walked towards the coffin and saw several bones the color of jade. He took one look at the bones and then glanced back at the crystal ball.</p>

  <p>"Those aren't mine. Those are the bones of a legendary beast," Mist quickly clarified.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and then realized that this celestial tomb wasn't Mist's. No matter how much he believed in karma, it was impossible for him to give his own bones away.</p>

  <p>So without hesitation, Luo Zheng reached out and chose the bones of the legendary beast as his reward.</p>

  <p>Obtaining the immortal's bones had been his most important mission ever since he entered the celestial tomb. These bones would help him in finding a way of unlocking the Eight Path Platforms. However, since he wouldn't have a chance to obtain the immortal's bones, maybe the bones of a legendary beast might suffice?</p>

  <p>After checking out the remaining treasures, Luo Zheng turned to mist, "How do I give these treasures to the rest of the warriors?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mist pointed to his left, "There's a passageway over there," he said. "You can choose what to reward them with when they pass through the Wheel of Fortune. Someone's actually about to pass the test, so hurry it up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips and quickly made his way to the wall at the back of the coffin where a luminous curtain had been placed. It was quite similar to the Picture Slab in the Central Region and it allowed him to see what was happening in the Wheel of Fortune. Next to the curtain was a small transmission array that Luo Zheng could use to send the treasures to the runner-ups.</p>

  <p>The situation at the Wheel of Fortune had taken him aback.</p>

  <p>From what he remembered, Ning Yudie had been standing right behind him before he passed, taking second place. Now, however, it seemed that Eddie and the Holy Maiden had caught up while Ning Yudie was still standing at the same place. Eddie was actually very close to the finish line and would soon pass the test.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng mulled over his thoughts for a moment, 'What should I give that guy?'</p>

  <p>Every item that had been in the coffin was invaluable. His eyes suddenly landed on a short sword that had been lying among the piles of treasures.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face suddenly darkened as he held the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The sword was a sacred weapon and he was damn well not going to give it to his greatest nemesis. He gripped the sword tight and stealthily slipped it into his space ring before pulling out a low-grade mysterious weapon from it. This weapon was the one he gathered to refine the heavenly essence in Central Region. At that time, he had been collecting all the low-grade mysterious weapons in Oracle City at the price of one supreme life vitality crystal.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Eddie had just thrown a four and had seemed to just pass the Wheel of Fortune.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Luo Zheng threw the low-grade mysterious weapon into the small transmission array.</p>

  <p>BUZZ!</p>

  <p>The moment he threw it onto the transmission array, the short sword quickly vanished and was delivered to the runner-up.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had taken the first place and had passed the Wheel of Fortune before him, Eddie had acknowledged that the young man's luck truly was better than his. However, that didn't mean his luck was bad altogether. At least, among the masters in the Central Region, no one had surpassed him in terms of luck. Just now, he had also passed the Wheel of Fortune and now he was awaiting his reward. Luo Zheng could be lucky this time but he posed no threat against Eddie. He was sure that he could kill him sooner or later.</p>

  <p>After walking through the last disk, Eddie arrived at a passageway. At the end of the said passageway was a transmission array wherein a piece of treasure awaited.</p>

  <p>Eddie's eyes flashed with excitement. He quickly walked forward but halted in his tracks to find the disappointing short sword lying there. "Is this the reward?" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>"A low-grade mysterious weapon? What the hell is this?" He couldn't believe his eyes. Any random reward that appeared in the Wheel of Fortune had been tens of thousands of times better than this low-grade mysterious weapon. This was no better than trash in Eddie's eyes. How could such a dismal weapon appear at the tomb of a majestic immortal?</p>

  <p>It was infuriatingly annoying but also a bit funny and the expression on his face was beyond words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but sneer at the sight of Eddie's face on the luminous curtain, "Huh, were you hoping for a reward for robbing a tomb?" he mocked. "You should feel lucky I even gave you something at least."</p>

  <p>Despite his disappointment, Eddie still took the mysterious weapon. It was still a celestial tomb and maybe there was something special hidden in it.</p>

  <p>He hoped there was something special in it, he really, really hoped.</p>

  <p>Mist did not know whether to laugh or cry upon seeing this scene. It was unfortunate for Eddie that Luo Zheng had been the worthy champion of the Wheel of Fortune. It was Luo Zheng that Mist had been waiting for this whole time and the one he deemed worthy of fulfilling his final wish. He had to let him do whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before a third person passed through the Wheel of Fortune and this time, it was Tia!</p>

  <p>Every time a warrior passed through, they would be transported to the tunnel they had walked through before arriving at the abyss, so Ning Yudie and Eddie would not meet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng once again looked at the treasures: Netherworld Juncus, Flower of Life and Death, numerous sacred weapons, Dragon Cloud Immortal Root…</p>

  <p>Since Mist had no intention of stopping him, Luo Zheng did not hesitate and threw half of the coffin's treasures down onto the transmission array.</p>

  <p>BANG! BOOM!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie walked forward towards the passageway after having been transported from the Wheel of Fortune. She hadn't expected the sudden cracking noises up ahead as if the tomb was about to collapse.</p>

  <p>She made a turn at a corner and was extremely shocked at what she saw.</p>

  <p>"So… so many treasures?!" she exclaimed, her eyes taking in all the sorts of treasure that awaited her.</p>

  <p>One, in particular had her gasping, "Flower of Life and Death! And not just one…four! Four Flowers of Life and Death!" The flowers were the most important thing to Ning Yudie and had been her main goal when she went in to explore the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Next to the flowers were numerous swords that glinted with gold and released a powerful Mu Ning, "Sacred weapons…"</p>

  <p>And a lot of other treasures as well.</p>

  <p>There were so many that all of them piled up like some sort of small treasure mountain and each one was worth no less than a low-grade sacred weapon. Once she got over the initial shock, Ning Yudie quickly waved her hand and secured all items into her space ring before walking away with a huge satisfied smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled at Yudie's happy gait. He thought that he should at least say goodbye to her before he left but he didn't really know what to say. He didn't know how long this trip would take him before he could come back.</p>

  <p>Three years? Maybe five?</p>

  <p>The thought of leaving for so long actually made him a bit depressed but it was a sacrifice he would have to make to save Yan. Rome was not built in a day and there were no shortcuts towards the path of defeating Eddie.</p>

  <p>A fourth person had passed through the Wheel of Fortune and this time, it was the Holy Maiden. Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes at the woman who had almost killed him in cold vengeance earlier. Luo Zheng casually took out another low-grade mysterious weapon from his space ring— it was a huge hammer!</p>

  <p>He immediately threw it onto the transmission array wherein it appeared at the passageway.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden still sported a sour face, no doubt still mourning the prince's recent death. Walking at the end of the passageway, she finally came upon a huge hammer.</p>

  <p>Her brows furrowed, "A mysterious weapon?" she whispered in disbelief.</p>

  <p>As someone from the divine kingdom and a worshiped maiden at that kingdom, this was actually the first time she had seen such a low-level weapon!</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this immortal!" she shouted before grabbing the hammer and hurling it at the passageway's wall to vent out her anger. The wall was fine but the hammer had been broken into several pieces. The woman had quite a temper!</p>

  <p>Mist felt a bit helpless at being cursed at for no reason at all. It wasn't his fault these people had bad beef with Luo Zheng who was awarding their venture to the tomb with weapons no better than trash. However, it wasn't really something he felt he should be bothered with and just let Luo Zheng do as he pleased.</p>

  <p>For the next passers, Luo Zheng would usually throw down some worthless items if they were from the other sects. However, if it was someone from Cloud Hall, he would give them a few good treasures. People like Imogen and Morphens received some good items while Emmanuel, who had been lucky enough to survive the Wheel of Fortune, got a mere low-grade mysterious weapon. It all depended on Zheng's mood. He didn't care if everyone was happy about what they got.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, the number of people in the Wheel of Fortune lessened until everyone had been able to return to the entrance of the celestial tomb through the passageway where a small crowd had formed to await their companions to join them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, remained behind the luminous curtain where he had been watching Ning Yudie. He noticed that she kept looking around as if trying to find someone— trying to find him. Luo Zheng had wanted to burn a message rune, trying to give her a sign, trying to give her something, anything but he decided against it in the end. He just stared at Tia's image on the curtain before softly whispering, "Wait for me."</p>
