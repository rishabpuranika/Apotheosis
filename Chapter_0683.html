<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was noon. The sun was blazing hot. Luo Zheng passed by a lot of warriors who looked at him with confusion. He did not pay any attention to these comments around and walked straight to the side of the magnetic stone. He stopped before the stone and started to examine it carefully.</p>

  <p>He found the magnetic stone to be very strange. He sensed something strange about it, some energy he had never felt before. Even the Law Power in it was very special from all the other powers he had learned.</p>

  <p>As the most basic constitution in the world, the Original Law existed almost everywhere. Just like mountains and boulders that contained the power of the Earth Law, various peculiar flames also contained the power of the Fire Law and the Space Law was seen everywhere in the vast space. Everything had a law, following a certain path and rule.</p>

  <p>However, most ordinary people could not sense them, understand or even get use of them. It took special skill to understand most of the laws that were known to mankind.</p>

  <p>The magnetic stone contained the power of seven Original Laws, which were the laws of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind and Electricity. All these seven Original Laws were evenly interwoven with each other which gave Luo Zheng a very peculiar feeling.</p>

  <p>The previous cultivator named Owen used the Wind Law to inspire the Wind Law stored in the magnetic stone. This was responsible for the change of the magnetic stone's color.</p>

  <p>'Using one power of the Original Law could make the magnetic stone change. What if I use the combined power of seven Original Laws? What will happen?' Luo Zheng suddenly had such an idea in his mind. Even he himself did not know why he had come up with such a fantastic idea.</p>

  <p>Little did he know that he was not the only one to have such an idea.</p>

  <p>The magnetic stone was indeed, a very unique stone. It did not belong to metal nor iron classification. It was so hard that neither sharp knives nor spears could break it. Even such a small piece of magnetic stone could not be broken by the all-out blow by a refiner of Virtual Tribulation Realm. It was harder than diamond, with very exceptional strength and durability.</p>

  <p>This magnetic stone was excavated from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain in the extreme depths of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. Not discovered by any human, it weathered at the top of the mountain and then dropped down after millions of years of natural evolution.</p>

  <p>Some refiners also inferred that it should require the master of seven Original Laws which were contained in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain to process or disassemble the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>At this point, it was almost impossible for the refiners of Central Region to do that. Thus, this stone was very precious, indeed.</p>

  <p>"Combine seven laws? Young man, what an audacious idea!" The cyan dragon said, his voice echoing in Zheng's mind. After swallowing that evil spirit of the Owl Beast, the cyan dragon had rarely said anything. Maybe because he seemed to be very busy with absorbing the soul power of the Owl Beast. Swallowing the spirit of the Owl Beast helped him recover from his weakness.</p>

  <p>"What did you mean? Is it really that hard to mix seven pieces of Law Power?" Luo Zheng asked, confused by the cyan dragon's statement.</p>

  <p>"Yes, very difficult. Besides, the magnetic stone here is not just an ordinary magnetic stone. If you can achieve a certain level of power in the future, maybe you can take the whole Magnetic Sacred Mountain. Don't think about the mountain too much now. It's such a great treasure, but for you now, you'd better not overthink." The cyan dragon explained calmly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened. He felt surprised with his heart jumping hard when the cyan dragon mentioned that the magnetic stone was not an ordinary one. No one knew how many precious treasures the cyan dragon had met before in his lifetime! For example, the precious blood of the Genuine Dragon was just considered ordinary by the cyan dragon. After all, he belonged to the Genuine Dragon, and the amount of blood he had was beyond measure.</p>

  <p>Bearing the cyan dragon's extraordinary comments in mind, Luo Zheng again carefully examined the stone in front of him. He scrutinized every nook and cranny that the stone possessed.</p>

  <p>'Magnetic Sacred Mountain, the legend of Dragon Lineage Human, the secret furnace, and nine Genuine Dragons. What are the connections among these?' Luo Zheng thought in his heart. He realized that there must be something beyond extraordinary that had happened in the universe which the cyan dragon refused to talk about.</p>

  <p>"The young man is staring at the magnetic stone blankly! What is he thinking about?"</p>

  <p>"Don't waste the time if you are too weak! Just punch it and go! If you are afraid of embarrassing yourself, why would you come here?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, man! There are still a lot of people in queue, waiting to pay money for the test. If you don't want to try, leave! Okay?"</p>

  <p>Many cultivators around Luo Zheng shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>Hearing the urging sound of the public, Luo Zheng shook his head. He seemed to overthink what the cyan dragon said. He was not as strong as the others in the Central Region, and it was useless for him to think about it too much.</p>

  <p>Coming around the idea, Luo Zheng slowly and firmly raised his fist into the air.</p>

  <p>To change the color of the magnetic stone, he needed to stimulate at least one Law Power.</p>

  <p>Those cultivators at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm had no profound understanding of the Law Power. For example, Owen's practice of the Wind Law only relied on the basic application and theory. In fact, he did not understand the Wind Law by himself.</p>

  <p>The Law Powers by nature were very difficult to be understood. Technique and a lot of patience were needed in order to master laws. Even Morphens understood only the surface of the Space Law. The Space Law needed very special understanding, as it was one of the most difficult laws in the world.</p>

  <p>'Since I cannot mix two pieces of Law Power, I will just use one single Law Power, the Thunder Law!' Luo Zheng thought. A surge of electricity was running through his arms. He then raised his hand and a lightning bolt came out of it, thin and weak looking.</p>

  <p>How could this be possible? How was Luo Zheng able to summon such weak lightning? He did not cultivate the refinement method with the Thunder attribute.</p>

  <p>"Well, what a tiny and thin lightning. This man is a joke!"</p>

  <p>"Is this the strength of Illuminating Soul Realm? I could not believe my eyes!"</p>

  <p>"The power of this lightning, I am afraid, might be even weaker than a normal nature creature. What a shame!"</p>

  <p>The refiners around Luo Zheng burst into laughter when they saw the thin bolt of lightning appear out of Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew how small and weak his lightning bolt was--even weaker than those generated by nature creatures. It was even far from the power generated by Tianming's Extreme Thunder Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>However, not everyone laughed at him. The old man across the table had sparkle in his eyes at the sight of the tiny bolt of lightning and a look of astonishment could be seen on his face.</p>

  <p>'What a pure power of thunder!'</p>

  <p>Not everything small could be considered weak. This old man marveled at the sight of the bolt, his heart racing with excitement. He was also wondering why the power of this lightning looked so weak when the young man owned such a pure power of thunder. This scene went against the common knowledge the old man had.</p>

  <p>After charging his tiny bolt, Luo Zheng raised his fist, aimed, and hit the magnetic stone hard.</p>

  <p>"Bump!"</p>

  <p>This punch hit the magnetic stone, generating a light cracking sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepped backward, his eyes illuminated with wonder, and he observed the changes that were happening with the stone.</p>

  <p>Most of the refiners who doubted Luo Zheng became quiet and stared at the stone.</p>

  <p>They didn't think that such a weak lightning could change the color of the magnetic stone. They leaned closer, expecting to see something worth laughing at.</p>

  <p>Everyone was staring, including the refiners, Luo Zheng, and the old man. And in a few seconds, the color changed from green to red. Everyone was shocked.</p>

  <p>"Look! It changed!"</p>

  <p>"How could it be? His punch just now was not powerful! How could it change the color of the magnetic stone?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe there's something wrong with the stone!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was so thirsty for the news that they plastered their eyes into the magnetic stone. They wanted to know everything.</p>

  <p>Three seconds drove by.</p>

  <p>Six seconds passed.</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds passed.</p>

  <p>Everyone counted and kept their eyes on the magnetic stone, incredibly.</p>

  <p>And the magnetic stone remained red and did not change the color back.</p>

  <p>According to the rule set by the old man, as long as the color of the magic stone became red, refiners could register successfully.</p>

  <p>Some powerful cultivators, such as the independent refiners of Internal Elixir Realm, could change the color of the stone and sustain it for around twenty seconds. That was pretty impressive!</p>

  <p>Some weaker refiners, such as the ones under the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, could change colors, too. But the change could only last up to two seconds. But still, it counted as passing the test, as per the rule.</p>

  <p>Owen, the refiner from Woollen Grassland who took the test before Luo Zheng, used the power of the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Real to change the color. He was able to change the color of the magnetic stone and sustain it to up to nine seconds! Even that was already impressive.</p>

  <p>But now, a new warrior held the record.</p>

  <p>The refiner at the level three of Illuminating Soul Realm had sustained the color for more than thirty seconds!</p>

  <p>Upon the stone's color changing, a lot of people were convinced that maybe the stone was indeed, broken. Thirty seconds had passed, and it had not yet reverted back to its original color, green. The longer the color stayed red, the more suspicion aroused.</p>

  <p>Forty seconds passed.</p>

  <p>Count was still going on and one minute passed.</p>

  <p>The magnetic stone stayed the same, without any sign of changing back to green.</p>

  <p>"I cannot believe that even the magnetic stone would be broken!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it has been punched for so many times that it got broken"</p>

  <p>"The magnetic stone is broken by punches! Are you kidding? The magnetic stone had fallen from the sky to a sacred mountain. How could it be broken by punches? It's more powerful than that!"</p>

  <p>After five minutes, the color started to change, fading from red into green.</p>

  <p>Noticing the change, Luo Zheng nodded slightly, then walked up to the old man with mustache and asked, "Did I pass?"</p>

  <p>The old man, a wise judge for the test, stared at the magnetic stone with a blank face. He was an expert in his field that he had more knowledge than the refiners around him. To the old man's delight, the magnetic stone was not damaged at all by frequent punches, not by wear-and-tear. It was still functioning properly.</p>

  <p>The old man was still in deep thought when he heard Zheng's words. He looked up to Luo Zheng in such astonishment, still disoriented, and said, "Yes, you have passed!"</p>
