<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yeoman fell heavily down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Roy, the member of the Yellow Emperor race, stood there like a God, his body shining with a bright golden light.</p>

  <p>Without even using a weapon, Roy defeated Yeoman with his bare hands alone.</p>

  <p>When Chandler and Farhann from the Nine Li race had been killed, Yeoman had been brought on as a substitute. Though he was also a mid-rank Wild God, his strength was weaker.</p>

  <p>As they watched the action play out in front of them, Adele and the others couldn't help but frown.</p>

  <p>Sure, they were all pretty convinced that Yeoman would lose. However they didn't expect that he'd be defeated so quickly. Both of the warriors were mid-rank Wild Gods, but the gap between Yeoman and his opponent was much too large.</p>

  <p>Yeoman, who was sprawled flat on the ground, was feeling rather indignant and tried getting up.</p>

  <p>Despite his attempt, Roy was quicker and his huge body jumped up. He then turned a somersault in the air and pounced directly on Yeoman.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As a loud noise rang out, Roy pressed Yeoman tightly against the ground. As he did so, he stretched out his finger and pressed it down on Yeoman's forehead. If he put forth his strength at this moment, the head of Yeoman would be crushed. If he gave any strength to his current move, he'd crush Yeoman's head in an instant.</p>

  <p>"The competition's final results are the most important. If you want to risk your life, I can simply do you the favor," said Roy in a cold, chilling voice.</p>

  <p>At that precise moment, Adele's voice faintly floated over. "Yeoman, just admit defeat. Don't resist uselessly. There's no point!"</p>

  <p>Seeing as Adele and Yeoman were members of the same race and shared the same blood, Adele had no desire for Yeoman to die.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the Nine Li race only lost one battle. There would be other chances for them to triumph in battle later.</p>

  <p>"I lost," Yeoman admitted unhappily.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Roy laughed coldly. He stood up in a single motion and retreated to the Yellow Emperor race immediately.</p>

  <p>Yeoman had equally transformed, removing the Wild God Power in his body and returned to his people.</p>

  <p>"Grand Elder, I want to fight," Elsa stated in a serious tone, staring at Roy with her brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>As she watched Yeoman suffer a crushing defeat, Elsa became furious.</p>

  <p>All she wanted to do now was to fight in order to win honor for her race.</p>

  <p>And more importantly, for Yeoman.</p>

  <p>Adele blinked and shook her head, offering a negative response. "It's better to fight in turn. It's too early for you right now."</p>

  <p>In Adele's mind, Elsa was the Nine Li race's trump card.</p>

  <p>If she were to try fighting ahead of turn, she'd indeed be capable of defeating Roy. If and when she did however, the Yellow Emperor warriors would then take turns challenging her, one after the next.</p>

  <p>If Elsa ended up being defeated, the results would be unpredictable, even if Zheng was considered the Nine Li race's trump card, too.</p>

  <p>"Monty! You go challenge him instead," Adele said in a flat and indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>Monty wasn't very strong, either. After all, the members of the Nine Li race had placed their hopes on Zheng, Elsa and Romeo with reason. More so, they could easily come to terms with the idea, if ever Yeoman and Monty were defeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Grand Elder!" Monty replied without hesitating. "I won't let any of you down," he assured as he nodded his head.</p>

  <p>Much like the others, Monty's position in the race wasn't very high. More so, his blood was only at the fourth grade.</p>

  <p>That said, he was a sedate person. Throughout all his years, he had been a very hardworking warrior. He had spent much more energy and time on cultivation than many others ever had.</p>

  <p>What he needed now was support from the members of his race, as well as more resources. In order to obtain the latter, the only thing he could do was to work even harder. He had to prove himself in this battle! He had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Monty flew up into the air. In a flash, he quickly turned into a giant with two heads and four arms. With a loud bang, he fell to the ground and the land surrounding him shook violently.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, David opened his eyes and glanced at Monty who landed not too far away. Then he immediately turned around and closed his eyes once again, as if he didn't want to look at Monty anymore.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race did nothing but ignore David's behavior, letting him continue doing whatever he was doing.</p>

  <p>Roy, on his behalf, gave David a cold glance.</p>

  <p>Although they were from the same race, Roy had a tendency of looking down on David, who came off pretty idle.</p>

  <p>'So what if he's very powerful? I can handle my opponent on my own!'</p>

  <p>As this thought crossed Roy's mind, he directed himself straight at Monty, his body flashing once again with golden light.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for the Nine Li race to play such a trick here. You aren't qualified to participate in the battle. It's a pure waste of time. Let Romeo or Elsa fight instead!" Roy shouted out at Monty while walking toward him confidently.</p>

  <p>On the Yellow Emperor race's list, Romeo and Elsa were two of the most important warriors. The others held no interest to them whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Elsa, on her behalf, had been famous for a long time and was considered the Nine Li Race's number one talent. Her strength, of course, was second to none.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Yellow Emperor race even paid attention to Romeo in the first place was because he had escaped from their chase on the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but Romeo had also killed three members of the Yellow Emperor race!</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race didn't yet have good reasons for getting back at Romeo, so they hadn't taken action against him. That didn't prevent the members of the Yellow Emperor race from paying special attention to Romeo, so much so that at times, they even concentrated more on him than they did to Elsa!</p>

  <p>What they didn't know though, was that Zheng had actually helped Romeo finish that particular feat at the time.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, the Yellow Emperor race wasn't even aware of his existence.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that they equally didn't know a thing about his background.</p>

  <p>Now though, Zheng joined the battle alongside Elsa and Romeo. Because they had no idea who he was, they simply regarded him as a substitute, and didn't even glance at him twice.</p>

  <p>By Roy's words, Monty wasn't angry at all. He replied calmly, "Whether I'm qualified or not isn't up to you. At least I'm in this battle ring now!"</p>

  <p>"All right... If you say so..." The corners of Roy's mouth curled into a wicked smile no one had ever seen before.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>His speed suddenly soared, and his huge body moved as light as the wind. In the blink of an eye, he was zooming toward Monty.</p>

  <p>"How fast!" someone called out in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Roy isn't very famous within the Yellow Emperor race, and he's the first one up to fight. But look at him now, he has such strength!"</p>

  <p>"The Nine Li race has no such powerful warriors ready for battle. I'm afraid they will be completely defeated!"</p>

  <p>Everyone watching the battle from a distance was discussing with one another in low voices, in order to avoid being overheard.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race had competed with the Nine Li race several times before, and their strengths were evenly matched. This time, it was a whole different story. The gap between the two was huge.</p>

  <p>As warriors of the Nine Li race began to notice the difference in strength, their expressions changed and they looked upset.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before Monty was capable of clearly seeing what had happened, his head was hit, the thud resonating loudly in his ears.</p>

  <p>Roy stopped moving for a second and looked at Monty, a trace of contempt on his face. He then pursued his actions.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>He continued swinging heavy blows at Monty's head, which made the latter unable to fight back in any way, shape, or form.</p>

  <p>If there was one thing to be said about Monty, it was that he was extremely tough. He was so tough in fact that he actually managed to hold on despite the beating. He didn't give in!</p>

  <p>"That's really troublesome," Roy mumbled with a long, disbelieving face. He stretched out his finger without second thought.</p>

  <p>With a snap, a ray of golden light burst out from his hand and quickly turned into a golden short blade. For a second time, he rushed at Monty without even thinking twice.</p>

  <p>If he successfully launched this attack, Roy's second battle was soon going to come to an end.</p>

  <p>As soon as Roy was no less than an arm away from Monty, Monty's eyes flashed a firm and serious glare. He howled loudly, grabbing onto Roy with one of his hands. With two of his other free hands, he clasped onto Roy's body, squeezing tightly.</p>

  <p>When fighting an opponent at close distance, the Nine Li Wild Body became even stronger and more powerful. It was both extreme and breathtaking to watch.</p>

  <p>Many of the Wild Gods were strong with more hands. Now that Monty bounded Roy, the result would be hard to predict.</p>
