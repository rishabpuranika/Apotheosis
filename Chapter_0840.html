<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite the question still hanging in the air, an unnerving silence filled the arena as everyone's eyes were trained on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Luo Zheng's background and life story seemed to be more mysterious than Yolande's own.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone was more interested in Luo Luo Zheng, and waited for his answer.</p>

  <p>At that moment Luo Luo Zheng did not respond to Yolande's question. However, he learned from her that she knew about the existence of another Yolande, who shared the same name as her.</p>

  <p>"I think I've met you before," Luo Luo Zheng answered vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Where?" Yolande asked. Her eyes glinted playfully under the light.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to answer her question directly. "We could talk, if there's a chance," he simply said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Yolande said and leaned over. "I like your smell. You can find me anytime you want," she said as she caught a whiff of his scent.</p>

  <p>When everyone else heard Yolande's words, they all got confused. Her words sounded a bit flirtatious, but she said them with an emotionless face.</p>

  <p>That made everyone feel that it was quite strange.</p>

  <p>The corner of Luo Zheng's mouth twisted into a slight smile. Yolande had left a deep impression on Luo Luo Zheng, so he was really curious about her mysterious background. When Luo Luo Zheng stayed in White Emperor City, he knew that Yolande came from the Yun Clan, one of the top clans of the Eastern Region. But was she really a member of the Yun Clan? Luo Luo Zheng didn't know anything about Yolande? her experience, background, and whatnot. If he had a chance to know all of those, he definitely wouldn't miss it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, several ogres came out from one side of the arena. The group leader was Boris, who was the most powerful talent of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Ever since the ogres had sent out their daredevil to assassinate Luo Luo Zheng, Boris had been worried about Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>He was a divine-level talent of the ogre, but he was worried about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Indeed, his behavior was strange. However, Boris was a stubborn warrior and he wouldn't easily change his mind. Just after Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Tower of Sin, Boris had already considered Luo Luo Zheng as an opponent.</p>

  <p>Thus, he was set on seizing a chance to challenge Luo Luo Zheng, and this idea was already rooted deep within his mind.</p>

  <p>This was Boris' warrior spirit! For him, he should be the only one to defeat or kill the opponent he wanted to challenge. It was exactly this kind of warrior spirit that made Boris the strongest talent in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Thus, Boris was extremely determined to oppose the ogres' attempt of using underhanded means to kill their opponent, specifically when they sent the Night Group assassin to kill Luo Luo Zheng. As far as he was concerned, such a disgraceful method was humiliating for the powerful ogres.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Boris didn't have a hand in the decision-making.</p>

  <p>He had no right, even if his father was the most powerful and influential member in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Although the sacred place seemed to have the ogres in the Tower of Sin under its control, in reality, the sacred place couldn't actually completely control the ogre war lords in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Those ogre war lords weren't as strong as the ogre war sages in the sacred place or those who had reached the Soul Sea Realm. But as they were in the Tower of Sin, the members of the sacred place couldn't do anything to them, and thus they couldn't control them in the tower.</p>

  <p>When Boris learned that the assassination had failed, he was overjoyed for quite a while. Then he continued to pay attention to Luo Luo Zheng, who climbed up the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>With Boris' current strength, he should've advanced to the eleventh floor of the Tower of Sin last month. However, he didn't choose to climb up the next floor so he could challenge Luo Luo Zheng earlier. Thus he waited for Luo Luo Zheng on the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p>

  <p>Now, Boris was considered quite short for an ogre. He was only half as tall as the several ogres who followed behind him. He looked like a small hill among those tall mountainous ogres.</p>

  <p>Those ogres were all level ten war generals, but their momentum was far inferior to that of Boris!</p>

  <p>An ordinary ogre usually gave off a distant Mu Ning which reminded those around him of an ancient, desolate mountain, but Boris' Mu Ning was unique. It was sharp and powerful, and those who Boris stared at would even feel a little pang of dull pain.</p>

  <p>Contrary to Boris' imposing Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng always had a faint smile on his face, which made others feel comfortable and relaxed. Luo Luo Zheng had learned to hide his powerful and terrifying Mu Ning after everything he had experienced, so he could completely hold it back without exposing it at all!</p>

  <p>At that point, all the spectators had their eyes on the arena.</p>

  <p>Boris was the overlord on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin. His power was on par with Cheryl Mu's, the divine-level talent of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>They were both considered the strongest among the war generals! Many creatures speculated that even if Boris entered the eleventh floor with just the cultivation base of a level ten war general, he would still be just as fearless.</p>

  <p>However, everyone knew that Boris was on the tenth floor to wait for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then again, they all thought that Luo Luo Zheng was an unbeatable human monster!</p>

  <p>Even as a level ten war fighter, he tried his best to win over the others, and managed to reach the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>With such a great achievement, it was no wonder the others called him an unbeatable monster. Up until Luo Luo Zheng, no human or creature had ever accomplished that feat.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's cultivation base continuously increased, he could finally reach the top of the tower and even win a seat. He would be quite powerful by then, so he might be able to change the rules in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason the ogres desperately wanted him dead. They were afraid that if such an outstanding warrior cultivated and improved his strength in this place, it would have terrifying and unimaginable consequences.</p>

  <p>Everyone clearly knew why Boris had waited for Luo Luo Zheng. Boris was a strong warrior who wanted to help the ogres defeat and kill Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Luo Luo Zheng was a strong war fighter at the tenth level, and was even able to defeat a level ten war general with a higher cultivation base than his.</p>

  <p>However, it was also known that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the only one who could challenge those with a higher cultivation level, as Boris could also do the same! The first-level and second-level war lords were probably a piece of cake for Boris.</p>

  <p>However, the battle between Boris and Luo Luo Zheng was something to look forward to!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up as he laughed upon hearing Boris' words. "I'm also looking forward to this battle!"</p>

  <p>"You've just entered the tenth floor, so you haven't been to the Talent Tablet, right? I will wait for you to return from the Talent Tablet!" Boris said.</p>

  <p>Confusion filled Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Talent Tablet?"</p>

  <p>He suddenly looked suspicious when Boris told him about the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Olivia had walked over to Luo Luo Zheng. "You've just entered the tenth floor, so you can go to the Talent Tablet to accept the baptism of talent!" she said with a smile. Then she added, "After you've reached the Talent Tablet, you can test your own talent and also improve it there! But how much your talent could increase depends on your luck?"</p>

  <p>"Talent!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed. His eyes lit up with palpable excitement.</p>

  <p>Talent usually measured a warrior's potential and how much room he had to grow.</p>

  <p>Talent, will, and luck were the three factors which often influenced a warrior's achievement and final strength. The will was no other than the warrior spirit. On the other hand, the warrior's endurance against hardships and persistence of heart were considered of great importance. Some warriors had outstanding talents, but they neglected cultivation and were completely absorbed in the decadent life. Such kind of warriors would be useless in the future, even if they possessed divine-level talents!</p>

  <p>However, compared with luck and talent, the warrior spirit could change more easily. As long as a warrior had the firm warrior spirit and kept on cultivating, he would naturally have great perseverance with stronger warrior spirit!</p>

  <p>But, it was hard to change talent and luck.</p>

  <p>Luck was very magical and intangible. No one could control it or figure out whether someone was lucky or not. Perhaps only God knew that!</p>

  <p>Someone previously said that Luo Luo Zheng had good luck on his side, but now no one was sure of how lucky he was, and whether he was lucky or not today.</p>

  <p>They could only infer and guess from Luo Zheng's past and experiences.</p>

  <p>Relatively speaking, it was easier to control and make use of talent than luck.</p>

  <p>A talented warrior had a cultivation speed faster than the others. He could understand things with just a single look and master skills with only a short bit of practice. Those showed that a warrior had an incredible talent.</p>

  <p>These warriors were divided into talents with different levels, namely the human-level talent, earth-level talent, heaven-level talent, saint-level talent and divine-level talent.</p>

  <p>Although the talents were ranked as such, it was just a general classification. Luo Luo Zheng learned from Olivia's words that the Talent Tablet was able to test and measure each warrior's talent. Moreover, it could even increase a warrior's talent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found this to be quite unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Right, the Tower of Sin's Talent Tablet does have the ability to change a warrior's talent. I can bring you there now!" Olivia exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It was evident that many creatures were also interested in Luo Zheng's talent now.</p>

  <p>He was only a level ten war fighter, but he had such great strength. It turned out that Luo Luo Zheng indeed had the divine-level talent, but there were differences between the divine-level talents. And so, everyone wanted to see how impressive Luo Zheng's talent was, and what level it reached!</p>
