<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air was tense. Everyone moved slowly and did not even dare to breathe too loudly as they crossed the Bloody Pass.</p>

  <p>There were two kinds of monsters that lived on each side of the Bloody Pass. They did not get in the way of each other and normally would not cross the border. It was because of these two kinds of monsters that crossing the Bloody Pass was extremely dangerous, but as long as people paid attention, it would be alright.</p>

  <p>This was not the first time Fabian and Esther came to this place. The two of them had crossed the Bloody Pass many times unscathed because neither of them was stupid enough to alert the monsters that lived there.</p>

  <p>Of course, that was the case with them. It was more difficult to cross safely when you had a couple of idiots with you such as the members of the Night Group.</p>

  <p>"If we can return to the Tower of Sin, we will expel the entire Night Group!" Esther vowed through gritted teeth. "Run faster!"</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't expelled the Night Group from the tower though he knew it would be a piece of cake since they had lost the ogres' protection. It was primarily due to the fact that Zheng did not want to risk offending other races and end up giving the ogres more allies. Nonetheless, it couldn't be denied that the Night Group was in a very precarious situation in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The crowd did not have any time to think about anything else as they ran across the Bloody Pass.</p>

  <p>Only the top-level war lord of the Night Group that had been attacked by Xun remained as he trembled on the ground. His eyes were filled with confusion. Why did that woman dare to make a move? Was she not afraid of catching the attention of the monsters?</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords of the Night Group were all up to no good and had secretly informed Malcom of Zheng's position. The plan was for the ogres to eliminate Zheng and turn the tides around. As long as the ogres regained their control of the tower, then the Night Group would surely get a share of the benefits.</p>

  <p>Of course, that was the main goal while fishing up benefits in the Dark Nether Cave was a secondary initiative. The Moon Shadow Begonia was an excellent opportunity and they did not really think that these guys would actually dare to start a fight in such a place.</p>

  <p>He had not expected that the woman armed with the long spear would actually kill him so suddenly without even considering the severity of the matter. He wasn't normally that weak since he was a top-level war lord of the Night Group that was famous for his top-notch body movements.</p>

  <p>Xun just really took him by surprise.</p>

  <p>The moment he screamed, a wolf's howl quickly followed and it did not sound that far away.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>Green shadows constantly moved about in the forest as a large number of monsters began to charge.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Bloody Pass, strange cackling sounds could be heard as the Swallowing Birds also began to make their moves.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, a giant cloud had formed in the sky. Zheng looked up and was secretly surprised at the amount of birds all flying together to form a black mass. They numbered at around four to five thousand!</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Zheng yelled.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>More than ten beams of light shot towards the Bloody Pass.</p>

  <p>Esther was extremely pissed and it didn't help that the Night Group's remaining top-level war lords continued following her. "Fuck off!" she screamed at them.</p>

  <p>A strange light began to glow in Esther's hands as resplendent flowers bloomed one after another. Their petals were quickly blown by the wind and floated towards the war lords of the Night Group.</p>

  <p>The petals of these flowers were deadly and, if any of them stuck to a person's skin, it was potentially fatal.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful Esther was, it would be impossible for her to simultaneously eliminate three top-level war lords. The petals she used were to only stop them from following her.</p>

  <p>As long as they were faster than the Night Group, they'd be safe.</p>

  <p>The Night Group's top-level war lords all wore bitter expressions on their faces. Had they known that this group would be so reckless, then they wouldn't have gone to get the Moon Shadow Begonia. Despite their speed and dexterity, Esther's flower petals were extremely hard to dodge and they ended up having to slow down.</p>

  <p>Everyone but them was able to rush through the Bloody Pass. Esther's flower petals really did their job of slowing them down while both the Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves inched ever so closer towards them.</p>

  <p>Esther hoped that the lives of these top-level war lords would be enough to fend off the monsters. Whoever survived would die at her hands.</p>

  <p>They knew the Tide of Chaos was brewing in the Dark Nether Cave, but these top-level war lords were too confident of themselves and stayed. Like the Demon Night and the humans, the Night Group had also ordered their clansmen to return to the Tower of Sin once they got word of the eruption of the Tide of Chaos.</p>

  <p>The four top-level war lords chose to remain and were met with tragedy.</p>

  <p>One was killed by Xun while the three others were encircled by monsters and now had to fight for their lives.</p>

  <p>They had their own ways of getting around. As the birds swooped in from the sky and the wolves came charging like the tide, all three of them used their life vitality and transformed into black smoke that slowly drifted about.</p>

  <p>"The Night Group's hiding skill is remarkable," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>There was really nothing the monsters could do once the war lords transformed themselves into smoke. However, there was still their sharp sense of smell. They knew very well that three people hid themselves in the smoke and so all they needed to do was follow the scent.</p>

  <p>The three top-level war lords moved very slowly after transformation.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they had no choice. It was turning into smoke or dying.</p>

  <p>"That hiding skill consumes a great deal of life vitality," Esther said coldly.</p>

  <p>"They won't be able to hold on for too long. They're doomed to die and they deserve it."</p>

  <p>Fabian shook his head with regret. "We're in great trouble now."</p>

  <p>A portion of the Azure Wolves and Swallowing birds had lost interest in the wisps of smoke and were now once again charging towards their group.</p>

  <p>Everyone did not dare to slow down. They could only run as fast as they could in hopes of shaking off the monsters.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. Why don't these wolves and birds just fight each other?" Jarrod grumbled gloomily.</p>

  <p>Disputes were normal among different kinds of monsters but it was just their luck that these two actually coexisted peacefully.</p>

  <p>Two forks diverged the path ahead. Normally, most people would choose the left path. However, they stopped when they noticed that two red snakes coiled at the corner of the road.</p>

  <p>Two fiery snakes, one male and one female, were intertwined and constantly twisted and coiled around each other— they were reproducing.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't think too much when he saw the snakes. They weren't too big and could not even be called pythons. In his eyes, they were just ordinary reptiles.</p>

  <p>However, Esther and Fabian did not share his sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Holy crap! We're doomed!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>The two of them shouted at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Purgatory Fire Snake…"</p>

  <p>"They're the most powerful monsters in the inner area! Why are they here in the outer area now?"</p>

  <p>"Seventeen top-level war lords of the Giants were killed in an instant by these two little snakes. Only one of them had been able to escape by using a secret technique to preserve his soul!"</p>

  <p>Though the Dark Nether Cave was usually chaotic when the Tide of Chaos broke out, the monsters in the inner area would rarely come out to the outer area.</p>

  <p>Though the inner and outer areas were not separated by that much distance, the monsters that resided in the inner area never ventured out of their domain. It was just some kind of unspoken rule.</p>

  <p>It had always been that way which was the reason why many top-level war lords dared to enter the Dark Nether Cave and even brought some war generals along for the experience.</p>

  <p>They were now faced with a big problem. The difference in strength between the monsters of the outer and inner areas was tremendous. Just how would they be able to push forward with the strongest monsters of the inner area standing in the way?</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression darkened at their words. He did not expect that two little snakes would be so fearsome.</p>

  <p>"Is there another way?" he asked, pointing at the path to his right.</p>

  <p>"No way!" both Esther and Fabian protested at the same time.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow. "But why?"</p>

  <p>"That's the way towards the inner area!"</p>
