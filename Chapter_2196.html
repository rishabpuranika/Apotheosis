<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's intention wasn't to offend this guy in any way.</p>

  <p>That said though, having been toyed with like an ant over and over again, Zheng had had enough. Even a Buddha would have become angry with such teasing.</p>

  <p>As Zheng took action, the Nine Divine Stars in his body began revolving crazily. The surging energy quickly converged into a torrent of energy that gushed outward, gathering in his hands faster than ever!</p>

  <p>In addition to the thirty percent of strength source that his body could withstand, he also released the remaining seventy percent of his power through the Cross-world Theurgy. This seventy percent power formed a giant invisible hand that grabbed the middle section of his opponent's arm.</p>

  <p>In that very moment, it was as if Zheng had three hands that worked together and simultaneously grabbed Bentley.</p>

  <p>Bentley, who was a top-rank True God, had already condensed Six Divine Stars, therefore, he also had his own strength source.</p>

  <p>Despite that though, the six stars that were hidden within his body were much smaller than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>The strength source of the Nine Divine Stars in Zheng's body came from Holy Jay. At the time, he had absorbed a third of Holy Jay's total strength source. Although Zheng's use of the strength source was far from being as efficient as Holy Jay's, and the fact was that it didn't even compare to Bentley's power in the least, it was still completely terrifying when it poured out!</p>

  <p>Moreover, Bentley hadn't expected Zheng to unleash such a terrifying power. He felt that Zheng's hands were like iron pincers, and even more shockingly, there was an invisible hand that seemed to be grabbing onto him at the same time. Furthermore, the invisible hand's power was great, causing his arm to creak. He felt like it was going to snap like a twig on a tree.</p>

  <p>This overwhelming power only lasted for a brief moment. With a flip of his body, Zheng twisted his hand and threw Bentley backward!</p>

  <p>Beneath the surge of such a huge force, Bentley didn't have time to resist. Confusion was written all over his wrinkled face as Zheng sent him flying at an extremely fast speed. His body soared through the air and smashed into the wall of the main building, destroying it into hundreds of little pieces.</p>

  <p>The wall then turned into dust in a flash, as if it was made of flour. This hit didn't stop Bentley's momentum though.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…</p>

  <p>After smashing through at least seven or eight walls consecutively, Bentley had finally managed to stop himself from going further by relying on his own power and strength. Finally, his body collapsed to the ground with an atrocious thud.</p>

  <p>Bentley's body was now covered in dust, and before landing, he had crashed into a few flower pots. A few fresh and tender flowers were stuck in his hair, making him look both bedraggled and odd at the same time.</p>

  <p>Bentley, who was still lying on the ground, was still in a daze and felt dizzy. It took him at least half a minute before finally reacting. Upon standing up, he saw a room full of people, including the old man surnamed Wu, who was giving a lecture to the disciples of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>As he noticed Bentley suddenly bump in, his mouth fell wide open.</p>

  <p>Although the old man had rarely seen Bentley throughout his lifetime, he knew Bentley was the leader of the twenty-seven Han Clan sub-branches. Thus, he asked in fluster, "Sir… Are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Among the students were also many members from the Han Clan sub-branches. They also wore strange expressions on their faces as they looked toward their leader. Bentley was a top-rank True God. Who could have caused him to be in such a sorry state, here in the Six-Burden Divine City?</p>

  <p>Everyone looked as though they had seen a ghost, or worse, that they would have preferred seeing a ghost over witnessing this scene.</p>

  <p>Bentley shook his head and smiled helplessly. "I'm fine. I was just sparring with a little kid, but there was an accident…"</p>

  <p>"A little... A little kid?" The old man's eyes widened and he raised his brows. He suddenly had a premonition. Was it possible that the "little kid" he was referring to could be Tianxing? That was impossible though, he thought to himself. Tianxing was just a proving godly warrior. No matter how powerful his abilities were, he would never have the capacity of throwing Bentley all the way over here.</p>

  <p>Bentley also felt very embarrassed. Worse, he felt ashamed that the fight had ended in such a way. After getting up, he quietly went back through the holes he had made in the walls.</p>

  <p>In order to see whether he had guessed right or not, the old man surnamed Wu also took a few steps forward and stuck his head into the first hole.</p>

  <p>Several layers of walls within the Heavenly Han House had holes that followed each other in a straight line, which were caused by Bentley. The old man surnamed Wu peeped through the holes and his gaze landed directly on the main hall. With this single glimpse, his eyes immediately widened!</p>

  <p>In the main hall, he could see Tianxing standing there, right smack in the center. He was looking at the other end of the holes with cold, emotionless eyes…</p>

  <p>"It, it really was this kid?!"</p>

  <p>The old man suddenly paled, unable to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>And the old man wasn't the only one who felt completely dumbstruck at that very moment. Even Malloy, Luke, and Declan were staring with wide eyes at the scene playing out in front of them.</p>

  <p>In truth, from the very beginning, the three of them had been against the idea of Bentley attacking Zheng.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Heavenly Han House was to send a qualified candidate to the Han Clan on the Floating Island in order to maintain the Han Clan's confidence in them. From Tianxing's performance alone, he indeed had the qualifications to be recommended, thus rendering Bentley's test completely meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, as the leader of the Han Clan sub-branches, Bentley hadn't been prudent and calm enough. He had lived for over 30 divine eras, and he could easily be considered the Han Clan's senior. Despite being rather old, wise and having lived for such a long time, he was definitely not a calm individual.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods made the decision to simply let their appearance age with the passing of time, especially after their ages crossed certain limits.</p>

  <p>Thus, in the divine land, it was quite common to see True Gods who looked very old. This was because if one lived for too long, their body would naturally exude a lethargic aura. They might be able to change their appearance to that of a teenager, but it was completely out of tune with the lethargic aura that they continued to exude!</p>

  <p>There were only a few women with very long lifespans that could use a secret technique to dispel the lethargic aura. No matter how long they lived, they were still as charming as ever.</p>

  <p>Bentley hadn't dispelled his old aura, but he still gave himself a younger look. Such a behavior made him seem quite unreliable.</p>

  <p>Despite that, one's personality didn't have anything to do with one's strength. Bentley's talent was good and back in the day, he had almost become the Holy Emperor's disciple. Unfortunately, he still lost the battle by a hair and thus lost an extremely important opportunity in his life. In the end, he took the initiative to leave the Floating Island of the Han Clan and returned to the Han Clan sub-branches in order to become the leader.</p>

  <p>Only a few moments ago, due to Bentley's provocation, Zheng had angrily thrown him out. And now, he was still raging.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's mind, Master Evil was also shocked. After seeing the many skills that Zheng had displayed though, and the fact that he also knew Zheng's identity, he could much more easily accept the scene than the others.</p>

  <p>What he hadn't expected was for Zheng to seriously attack Bentley. He then said to Zheng, "You are too impulsive. Your strength is indeed astonishing, but if the fight gets serious, you might not necessarily be a low-rank True God's opponent and a mid-rank True God can easily kill you. Bentley is an outstanding top-rank True God and you will be doomed if you actually offended him!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil had lived in the Vast Sky Region for many years now, and of course, he had heard of Bentley. In the Han Clan's ancestral land, other than a few old fellows who had retreated back to their homeland, Bentley was probably the strongest. Now Zheng had taken Bentley by surprise and had thrown him out in such a way, causing him to suffer a huge loss as well as lose his face. Master Evil had every reason to be worried that things might not end so well for Zheng...</p>

  <p>"If I were to tolerate that over and over again, what would this guy have ended up doing to me?" Zheng retorted in his mind. "He did that only to force me to show the limits of my strength, or to investigate my background. I can die, but there are some things that will never be revealed," he said aloud in his mind.</p>

  <p>His father had indeed placed his greatest hopes in him, but Zheng wasn't his only hope. After all, there were still Nathan and the other Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Master Evil fell silent. He could feel Zheng's determination, and he understood how heavy the burden on his back was for him to reach his goal. Although he had an extraordinary origin, that he was the son of a Holy Being and what was more, he was a disciple of another Holy Being, he still had to pay a greater price than any other ordinary warriors with such unique advantages.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was as calm as the surface of a motionless lake as he stared at Bentley, who was walking over through the holes, one wall at a time.</p>

  <p>Bentley stepped out from the final hole and gently shook himself. An invisible force spread out from his body, causing all the dust, rubble, and broken leaves to disappear. His body was now completely clean, and his face was expressionless. No one could read him, and no one could tell how he was feeling.</p>

  <p>Malloy, Luke, and Declan held their silence. They didn't dare say anything more. Although Bentley had an eccentric temperament, he was still the leader of the Han Clan sub-branches. They had no idea how Bentley planned to deal with Zheng. Bentley's personality had always been unpredictable though, to say the least.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Bentley laughed and said to Zheng, "Good.</p>

  <p>Although I don't know how you've managed to cultivate such power, I think the old freaks on the Floating Island would be very happy to see a little freak just like you!"</p>
