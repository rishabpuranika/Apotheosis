  <p>
</p>

  <p>No matter how fierce the steel ropes were, they immediately shattered and dissipated upon touching the ball.</p>

  <p>This sight filled Luo Luo Zheng with ease.</p>

  <p>He was currently unable to directly control this kind of power. If he tried to inject it into himself, his body might not be able to bear such violent power and disintegrate. Therefore, he could only project it by means of the Cross-world token.</p>

  <p>Using it like this might seem inefficient but it should not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, who had attached herself to Luo Zheng's body, looked up at him with surprise.</p>

  <p>Her premonition was proven right but it was still quite shocking. She had initially thought that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to catch up to her brother. She was wrong. Luo Luo Zheng would actually go far beyond whatever her brother was capable of.</p>

  <p>'He will bring me to the Soul Suppressing Cliff, ' Han Liusu thought to herself.</p>

  <p>She smiled and rested her head on his shoulder. If Luo Luo Zheng did not manage to bring her to that place, then she didn't think anybody else in this entire world would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>The steel ropes were rendered useless by the ball since each lash caused them to immediately disintegrate and disappear. This was a loss to the Martial Sacred Beast since each steel rope it lost was equal to losing one of its arms.</p>

  <p>Realizing the futility of its attacks, the beast retreated its ropes.</p>

  <p>The crowd wiped off their sweat and looked up at Luo Luo Zheng with fear in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Back in the Collapsing Mountain race, Luo Luo Zheng gathered the power of the nine stars in the place three inches from his fist and wielded it as a way for him to display his strength. Everyone thought it was Luo Zheng's own power, not noticing the finer details.</p>

  <p>However, this time, Luo Luo Zheng had directly spread his power outside of his body.</p>

  <p>This couldn't be pure power, at least none of them thought so.</p>

  <p>When ordinary warriors displayed their power, they would usually need their bodies to activate it. This made it impossible to force their power out of their bodies and make it into an independent existence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, had transformed his power into this egg-shaped shield that he wrapped around himself for protection. It looked more like some kind of token.</p>

  <p>But what sort of token had such power? Luo Luo Zheng was merely at the Spirit Supreme Realm. How in the world was he able to resist the Martial Sacred Beast's attacks?</p>

  <p>World lords such as Kennan would be the ones with the strongest token amongst everyone present. However, even Kennan's Wishing Spell wouldn't be enough to block all the beast's ropes. Luo Luo Zheng did not just block them. His shield was actually strong enough to destroy them!</p>

  <p>None of them could've ever thought that Luo Luo Zheng was using the Cross-world token to directly project his power from his inner world to the outside world.</p>

  <p>It was only after Luo Luo Zheng allowed the ball to disappear that the group felt a sharp pain in their ears.</p>

  <p>Their hearing was temporarily impaired due to the high-frequency vibrations generated by the tremendous power from before.</p>

  <p>It took a while for the power to disappear and when it did, they began to feel an unbearable pain in their ears! Some of the weaker warriors even had blood flowing out from their ears.</p>

  <p>Just as they recovered their hearing, the ground began to shake again.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>There were rumbling footsteps that echoed from somewhere not too far away, as if a huge creature was approaching at high speed.</p>

  <p>Rustling could be heard all around them.</p>

  <p>One by one, the trees began to fall in the distance!</p>

  <p>Each tremor made everyone's heart pound in fear.</p>

  <p>The tremors grew even more intense as the rumbling footsteps got closer and closer. Each step sent the warriors around two to three inches up in the air, so some of them deliberately fixed their feet on the ground to keep their balance.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>From the collapsing giant trees burst forth a huge creature!</p>

  <p>Everyone couldn't help but stare at the colossus.</p>

  <p>"Is this a Martial Sacred Beast?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>The Martial Sacred Beast looked like a giant serpent but with four legs and a huge crown. On its crown were countless steel ropes that continuously wiggled. They seemed to serve as the beast's tentacles.</p>

  <p>What was even stranger was that half of its body seemed to be made of cyan and gray metal, while the other half was light-green colored skin full of grids and rhombus-shaped scales.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be considered as huge as they first thought it was when they heard it approach. The beast was just a little bit taller than the giant trees around, about 600 to 800 feet high, much smaller than the Formless Sky Python from before.</p>

  <p>However, it carried an air of intense oppression that everyone, including Luo Luo Zheng, could feel.</p>

  <p>They felt they were facing such a powerful existence that shouldn't exist in this world!</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race, famous for their boldness, held their breaths in the face of this beast. They had long known that a Martial Sacred Beast lived here but nobody had ever seen it in person. All they saw were its tentacles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength might have reached a terrifying level but there was no way he could take down this Martial Sacred Beast!</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Luo Zheng felt insignificant as he faced this fearsome opponent.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The Martial Sacred Beast took a step forward and its blood-red eyes were fixated upon Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt his chest constrict as the beast stared down at him.</p>

  <p>He knew his strength and power had greatly improved but not enough for him to feel confident when facing this beast of legend.</p>

  <p>The best choice would be to relinquish Han Liusu to the Martial Sacred Beast. However, that wouldn't be possible since they already made a deal. She helped him and he agreed to take her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff in exchange.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Martial Sacred Beast and Luo Luo Zheng continued staring at each other.</p>

  <p>Chapman clenched his teeth. He wanted to persuade Luo Luo Zheng as well but ended up not saying anything in the end.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>A steel rope burst forth from the beast's crown and was aimed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Its target remained the same: Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>The moment it reached Luo Luo Zheng, the young man waved his hand and sent out an arc of pure strength.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The force was enough to sever the steel rope!</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart trembled at the sound of the breaking rope.</p>

  <p>Would they survive the fury of the Martial Sacred Beast?</p>

  <p>The warriors from the divine land had been wondering what exactly the Martial Sacred Beast was after hearing about it from the Collapsing Mountain race. Right now, they wished they never found out at all.</p>

  <p>Its appearance was easily recognizable for many of them and they couldn't help but curse under their breaths.</p>

  <p>It was a Black Weasel, a true spirit hatched from Sunrest Wood.</p>

  <p>There were only around seven or eight Black Weasels that currently existed and one had already been subdued by the head of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. This Black Weasel in front of them had never shown its face and they never would've imagined that it would get half of a puppet body and become like this.</p>

  <p>However, what was scarier than the weasel itself was the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was actually planning to fight it.</p>

  <p>A Spirit Supreme Realm warrior like him competed with a true spirit?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was courting his own ruin.</p>

  <p>Old man Theodore was secretly regretting his decisions. He had originally planned to leave the Collapsing Mountain race and had gone on this expedition with his team to secretly observe Luo Luo Zheng. He didn't expect to come face-to-face with a true spirit!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, give that girl to the Martial Sacred Beast," a warrior said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, turned a deaf ear to his advice. His eyes were filled with persistence as he continued to look straight at the Black Weasel.</p>

  <p>The two were at a standstill. Despite the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had cut off its tentacle, the Black Weasel did not attack Luo Luo Zheng and the young man was the same. In fact, the beast seemed to be afraid of something, or perhaps, it did not wish to fight with him.</p>

  <p>The Black Weasel extended another tentacle in an attempt to reach Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt his back tighten as the tentacle reached towards them while Han Liusu tightened her grip around his throat in fear.</p>

  <p>Kennan and his companions were far more knowledgeable and experienced than the ordinary martial artists in the divine land as followers of the Holy Emperor. They knew the Black Weasel's origins very well. If the Princess Royal were to be swallowed by the beast, then the Holy Emperor wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng threw another punch and another half-moon strike once again cut the tentacle off.</p>

  <p>Having been stopped twice now, the Black Weasel suddenly raised its head.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>His sharp roar was followed by the swaying of the trees. Those present couldn't keep their balance anymore. A large number of the martial artists from the Snake and Tiger Hunt Squads fell to the ground, and some even fainted.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also felt the painful, swelling sensation but did not move an inch.</p>

  <p>The Black Weasel continued to roar as it approached Luo Luo Zheng. Only when the young man was within arm's reach did it finally stop.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng clenched his fists tightly as his heart beat nervously fast. The beast was so close now that he could smell the stench from its breath.</p>

  <p>If the Black Weasel chose to swallow him all in one gulp, would he even be able to resist?</p>
