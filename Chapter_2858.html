  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of Hamish had somewhat eased the tension on both sides, but Clark and the other Holy Beings still didn't want to let Samuel go.</p>

  <p>After all, the Holy Beings could be reborn infinitely; even if they died during the fighting, they could be revived and engage in battle again.</p>

  <p>"Master Hamish! You have no idea how ambitious this man is. He has robbed the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island right after he returned from the Abyss Demon Region. We can't just sit by and watch!"</p>

  <p>"The alliance of powerful clans was established to let the clans depend on each other and have a mutually beneficial relationship. How, then, could we tolerate this man?"</p>

  <p>"That's Gregorio, someone harboring a deep hatred against the Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>As the Holy Beings discussed the matter among themselves, the situation became a little chaotic.</p>

  <p>Hamish waved his hand at them, and everyone calmed down.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the disciples of the Han Clan, reached out his hand, and conjured up a bright yellow ring of light.</p>

  <p>The ring of light spread out and instantly encased Samuel, Pascal and the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>He didn't want irrelevant people to hear what he was about to say.</p>

  <p>"Some of the hatred in this world should be laid to rest. In the past, Nicholas destroyed the Floating Island of the Yue Clan; now, Samuel has already taken his revenge on him. This way, the enmity between the two clans can cease. Besides, Samuel doesn't stir up trouble for the Ray Tree, so everyone can take a step back. What do you think?" Hamish smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Clark immediately realized that Hamish meant to resolve the dispute.</p>

  <p>Murphy's and Jeremiah's eyes flashed. They wondered whether this Yellow Emperor Guard was going to support Samuel.</p>

  <p>Why? Was it because Samuel was so powerful?</p>

  <p>Samuel said nothing.</p>

  <p>Even though Pierson had sacrificed himself for a compromise, Samuel had no plans of giving up until the entire Dongfang Clan was wiped out.</p>

  <p>Every single member of the Dongfang Clan must be exterminated. He knew that better than anyone else.</p>

  <p>He himself had been neglected by Nicholas in the past. After being reincarnated, he finally seized the chance to take his revenge.</p>

  <p>However, hearing what Hamish said, Samuel thought it inappropriate for him to offer a retort and held his tongue.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, he realized in the Hall of Holy Beings that despite having control over the absolute power, he would still have difficulty suppressing other powerful clans if no Holy Being followed him. However, if the Holy Beings such as Clark, Murphy, Jeremiah, and Zeke could help him, then the situation would be entirely different...</p>

  <p>"Master Hamish, what do you mean?" Clark asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Hamish spoke calmly, "I've already made it clear: you need a leader to take charge of the alliance of the powerful clans."</p>

  <p>"And Samuel is to be that leader? Impossible!" Jeremiah snorted derisively.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm saying!" Zeke agreed. "If he becomes the leader of the alliance, our Fang Clan will immediately quit."</p>

  <p>Although the Holy Beings also pursued the absolute power, they remained loyal to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>If the other Holy Beings stood behind Samuel after he had just destroyed the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island, it would only bring shame on their heads.</p>

  <p>The corners of Hamish's mouth slightly curled up. "In this respect, I'm afraid you have no other choice."</p>

  <p>The expressions on Murphy's and the others' faces changed slightly. They never expected that Hamish would be so determined to support Samuel.</p>

  <p>Clark said angrily, "Master Hamish, do you think that's fair to Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>Hamish only shook his head and replied, "This is my brother's decision. I believe that he will also break the Mixed Element Seal soon."</p>

  <p>After all, Nicholas was only a pawn of the Yellow Emperor Guards: a figurehead and spokesman.</p>

  <p>That pawn had already been dead, and Samuel, who was even more useful in comparison, was willing to be on their side. Leyton saw no reason to refuse him.</p>

  <p>However, this decision disappointed all of the Holy Beings, who looked shocked after hearing these words.</p>

  <p>Hamish was considered to be the weakest among the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>If the more powerful Yellow Emperor Guards were released, what would happen? Would there be any force in the entire divine land that could contend with them?</p>

  <p>Looking at the silent Holy Beings, Hamish said consolingly, "Everyone, don't worry. I'm sure that it won't be long before the entire divine land is under our control. We'll eliminate all of the other setbacks."</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, the Holy Beings finally decided to leave.</p>

  <p>Even if they were not totally convinced, they could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>Looking at Murphy and the others who seemed depressed, Clark got dejected inwardly, thinking how unlucky they were to have such a matter happen to them.</p>

  <p>After the Holy Beings had left, Hamish suddenly said to Samuel, "There. I have fulfilled my brother's promise to help you become the leader of the alliance of powerful clans."</p>

  <p>Samuel shook his head. "I'm afraid I will only be a nominal leader."</p>

  <p>"Of course they are not convinced for now because I am the only one who came today. Once my brother, Leyton, is here, they will have no choice but to accept," Hamish said flatly.</p>

  <p>"But these Holy Beings have unparalleled understanding of the rules of the divine land and they are not afraid of death at all," Samuel said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Clark, in particular, seemed undaunted by anything; after he had experienced death thousands of times, dying was nothing to him anymore.</p>

  <p>Once he was involved in a universe war, Samuel's advantage would no longer exist. After all, it was the war of the creatures in the universes.</p>

  <p>Hamish suddenly burst into a faint smile. "This is not a problem at all. My brother can directly kill a Holy Being. With that kind of power, no one in the divine land will dare to disobey him."</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes lit up. "Then... when will the Mixed Element Seal be broken?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is ready," Hamish said lightly. "You need to go to the northernmost region again." His gaze fell on Pascal.</p>

  <p>"That's great!" Samuel nodded.</p>

  <p>When he came back to the Floating Island this time, Samuel failed to get the approval of other Holy Beings, thereby causing him some disappointment.</p>

  <p>The next time he returned, he would release all of the Yellow Emperor Guards. By then, he would overthrow those stubborn beings.</p>

  <p>When Samuel activated the ring earlier, the fairy palace in the Swirl Forest also fell into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The people in the fairy palace were puzzled by this scene...</p>

  <p>What type of sorcery could be used to cover the whole sky?</p>

  <p>Even after speculating in the fairy palace for a long time, Harold could not come up with a satisfactory answer.</p>

  <p>Recently, the fairy palace was inundated by an increasing number of people, who filled the palace with noise and excitement every day.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses who returned to the fairy palace included Tianming, Lucille who had been sent back by Zheng, Kurt, and Lone. It was Harold who had found and brought back Kurt and Lone.</p>

  <p>These several Godly Geniuses had been cultivating their skills day and night in the training tower. Upon coming out of the tower, they expressed their delight in seeing Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Among the Godly Geniuses in the fairy palace, Lucille was the unluckiest.</p>

  <p>She was captured to become a puppet, and thus her training time was delayed. As a result, her cultivation base was slightly weaker than those of the rest of the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>In the past, Lone was the weakest of the ten Godly Geniuses. Then, after having stepped into the divine land, he inherited the relics of a great clan's ancestral land. Afterwards, he managed to succeed in every endeavor, all the time. Now, he had reached the peak of top-rank True God Realm and was starting to train to become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>As for the remaining Godly Geniuses, it would still be difficult to find them even if Harold were to look for them in person. Even with his unparalleled skill in deduction, the search for the Godly Geniuses would be as difficult as looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Mike would revive soon. By then, if Mike would look for them, he would definitely be able to track the location of the other Godly Geniuses.</p>
