  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sunflower Water World was geographically located in a special place? right on the border between the Humanity Alliance and the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the entire supreme world was covered in pale green water known as "Sunflower Water", which was where it got its name from.</p>

  <p>The moment Maha had entered the Sunflower Water World, this supreme world had become the prime focus of attention in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Day in and day out, the eyes of all the living creatures in the universe were fixed on this place. Many warriors who were unafraid of death had also sneaked into the Sunflower Water World just to witness the remarkable performances of the talents in the universe with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were also a great number of Sacred martial artists among them.</p>

  <p>The senior leaders of the Sacred race and the human race seemed to have reached a mutual understanding. The Supreme Lords had begun to lay out their plans around the Sunflower Water World, but they didn't have any intention of entering it. Instead, they would let the warriors battle it out here.</p>

  <p>As such, the Sunflower Water World had transformed into a huge battle ring with unwritten rules.</p>

  <p>In every battle, once the warriors agreed to challenge each other, no one else was allowed to help them.</p>

  <p>And, most importantly, it was a battle to the death.</p>

  <p>When the battle was over, the winner could shout loudly with joy and even use the Roaring Token to announce their victory to the whole universe.</p>

  <p>As for the martial artists on both sides, they were fighting solely for their honor, because even if they won, they wouldn't receive any reward.</p>

  <p>The universe was filled with crazy beings. Some martial artists were born for fighting, and they didn't care that their efforts would go unrewarded. They all wanted to enjoy the thrill of defeating the warriors from an alien race.</p>

  <p>There were countless excruciating battles happening every day in the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>However, the most entertaining and eye-catching ones were still Maha's.</p>

  <p>Ever since Maha had decided to singlehandedly challenge all the talents in the universe, warriors had been losing to him one after the other. The number of grand world lords who had lost to him had crossed 300.</p>

  <p>Among them, there were 208 humans and 47 ogres. And even though the Demon Night was trapped in internal strife, there were still many Demon Night warriors who had come to the Sunflower Water World. Maha had defeated 13 of them, as well as over 30 world lords from other races.</p>

  <p>Every time Maha killed a world lord, he would announce the name and race of his opponent to the universe through the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, he would even comment on his opponent's strength, but the majority of his comments were negative.</p>

  <p>In doing so, he effectively sapped the morale of the warriors and reduced the momentum of the universe.</p>

  <p>But although Maha had shown great strength and a merciless attitude, there was still a long line of martial artists waiting to challenge him. The universe was facing a crisis, and many martial artists understood that their lives were already at stake. If they had to die, then it was better to die a worthy death. They might as well gather up their courage to challenge Maha in an attempt to make a great achievement. In fact, deep down, every one of them believed that they would be the one to defeat Maha.</p>

  <p>Alas, it was a pity that such a victory had not occurred yet.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the countless martial artists and mortals in the universe were all paying attention to the Sunflower Water World. Every day, righteous indignation filled them when they heard that yet another martial artist had been killed by Maha. At the same time, they harbored resentment toward the ten Godly Geniuses in the universe.</p>

  <p>Where were Luo Luo Zheng and Nathan at this moment? Maha had been defeating the world lords one by one, but the most outstanding talents of the Illusion Battlefield had become cowards, especially Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the universe that day, he had made extremely impassioned remarks about war. But now, he had vanished without a trace. His disappearance had enraged many warriors and made them feel ashamed of him.</p>

  <p>Without a capable and worthy figure to pin their hopes on, the morale of the entire universe was rapidly declining.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Sunflower Water World was a hilly region. A human city was built around this hilly region in the shape of a crescent moon.</p>

  <p>Hence, it was named Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>It was an inconspicuous city, and even the city lord of Iron Moon City only had a cultivation base of Soul Sea Realm. Normally, this small city had very few visitors, and hence very few problems. The millions of mortals who were born in the Iron Moon City had been living happy and peaceful lives there.</p>

  <p>But when Maha had placed the battle ring in the center of Sunflower Water World, the Iron Moon City had undergone a tremendous transformation.</p>

  <p>Countless powerful warriors had rushed into this unknown little city, including Soul Sea Realm warriors, Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, world lords, and even grand world lords.</p>

  <p>Humans, Sacred warriors, and warriors from countless other small races had all infiltrated this small city.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Sacred warriors and human warriors were carefully maintaining the peace and balance. Every time they mounted a challenge, they moved the battle to the tallest hill near the city instead of fighting within city limits.</p>

  <p>Since the Iron Moon City was wrapped around a cluster of hills in the shape of a moon, warriors could find the best viewing spots in the city to watch the battles and cheer for the warriors of their races. Now, one such battle was taking place with none other than Maha himself...</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A golden light flashed across the hill!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The head of the grand world lord that Maha was fighting exploded; blood spurted out from his neck, spraying dozens of feet into the air before slowly sprinkling down to the ground like rain.</p>

  <p>Maha stood in front of the human grand world lord, his face filled with ridicule. He took out a Roaring Token and growled, "A small monk from the Blessed Buddha Land has only been able to exchange three moves with me. He's too weak..."</p>

  <p>"Alas, Gene has been defeated by Maha as well!"</p>

  <p>"Gene and Kurt cultivated in the Blessed Buddha Land together, and Gene can also be considered an ace talent. But even he was only able to withstand three of Maha's moves!"</p>

  <p>"This only proves that Maha is too strong. He is nearly undefeatable!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, so what? He's just a Godly Genius after all! There are many Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe!"</p>

  <p>"Where are they, then?"</p>

  <p>In a 1000-foot high restaurant perched atop Iron Moon City, many martial artists sat around discussing the battle. These martial artists were all at the Spirit Transformation Realm. Even from dozens of miles away, they were able to clearly see the battle on the hill.</p>

  <p>But when one of them asked about the whereabouts of the Godly Geniuses, the others immediately went silent...</p>

  <p>Maha was constantly provoking and killing warriors, but not a single Godly Genius dared to go there to challenge him.</p>

  <p>"I, Alvin from the ogre race, challenge you!"</p>

  <p>It hadn't even been a few seconds after Maha had killed the martial artist of the Blessed Buddha Land when a tall and burly ogre grand world lord jumped out to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Contrary to the expectations of the ogre grand world lord, Maha shook his head. "I've already said that I will only accept three challenges a day.</p>

  <p>After killing three people, I won't take any action. If you want to challenge me, then go join the queue."</p>

  <p>Inside the Iron Moon City, there were many grand world lords quietly waiting for their turn to fight Maha. They had all come here for the sole purpose of challenging him.</p>

  <p>"Humph. I don't care about such rules. Today, I will chop you into pieces!" Alvin said gruffly, looking at Maha with an arrogant glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Alvin did not plan to follow the rules at all. He was sick and tired of watching Maha terrorize the universe and wanted to be the hero who could put a stop to it.</p>

  <p>Maha stretched lazily, ignoring Alvin's provocation. Then, he turned around and walked down the hill. With his back to Alvin, he said, "If you want to fight someone, you can look for other warriors. After all, I'm not the only Godly Genius in the Sacred race. Connie..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Maha said her name, a plump and enchanting woman appeared in front of Alvin, blocking his way. With a charming smile on her face, she said, "Before you can challenge Maha, you have to fight me first!"</p>

  <p>"Bitch, just get lost!" Alvin retorted, grimacing.</p>

  <p>He had no interest in challenging a woman.</p>

  <p>His hill-like body suddenly leaped into the air. A pair of dark golden axes began spinning around crazily, shooting out ax shadows that wrapped around his entire body as he violently dashed toward Maha.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Maha floated down the hill at a gentle speed as if he hadn't noticed Alvin's attack at all.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Sky Beam Annihilation Wheel!"</p>

  <p>Huff, huff, huff...</p>

  <p>Alvin's two great axes rapidly danced in the air and sliced through the wind, creating a vortex. Just as Maha was about to be sucked into that vortex, a black object suddenly shot toward Alvin.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>The black object turned out to be a bead that exploded like a bomb, releasing an astonishing burst of power.</p>

  <p>Alvin, who was wielding the axes, felt a strong force hitting his right palm, causing his hand to go numb. The vortex he had created immediately disappeared. He turned his head and, to his shock, saw dense black beads floating next to Connie.</p>

  <p>The strength of the Sacred woman in front of him was actually far beyond what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>"I've already told you that I'm your opponent, not him. Why didn't you listen to me?" Connie said with a smile. As her hands moved, those black beads seemed to come to life, floating up and down around her.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the reckless and arrogant expression on Alvin's face completely vanished. This Sacred woman was a worthy opponent after all. Of course, her strength seemed far inferior to Maha's, but Alvin thought that if he couldn't defeat her, then he didn't have the qualifications to challenge Maha at all.</p>
