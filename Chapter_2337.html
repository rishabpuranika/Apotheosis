<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had struggled to split the two Soul-killing Ghosts into pieces, they finally released an invisible soul force!</p>

  <p>The immensely pure soul force circled around for a while before it flew towards him.</p>

  <p>He, however had originally planned to dodge it but he didn't have enough time to do so. The soul force immediately entered his mind and merged with his own soul.</p>

  <p>As soon as it fused with his mind, he suddenly felt that his soul became a little stronger.</p>

  <p>Yet at that moment, he quickly figured out something... "This is not the broken piece of the Soul-killing Ghost... this is the reward!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Instead of divine might coins, the soul force was the reward for eliminating the Soul-killing Ghosts. Such a big prize was beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other side became slightly chaotic as some of the True Gods were in the middle of a commotion. "I have no way of dealing with these ghosts. I need to go first through the Star Door!" some of them shouted.</p>

  <p>Although many True Gods cultivated two or even three kinds of Divine Dao, not every one of them cultivated a Divine Dao related to the thunder. Therefore, those True Gods couldn't do anything to deal with those malicious spirits.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Crackling sounds filled the air as the True Gods fired lightning and retreated at the same time.</p>

  <p>White, blue, and purple flashes filled the place.</p>

  <p>Those different Thunder Laws they exhibited contained different kinds of powers and their corresponding effects.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts however, weren't ordinary ghosts at all. They were intelligent, and they simply crawled away at a very fast speed when faced with lightning.</p>

  <p>The lightning strikes struck violently, but they only managed to kill about three Soul-killing Ghosts every time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, about eight Soul-killing Ghosts jumped simultaneously and threw the hooks in their hands once they found a chance to attack!</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Luo Zheng warned. He was fortunate that he could see things more clearly with his eyes.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods had to use their soul power to sense the ghosts' presence.</p>

  <p>"They are coming! What should I do? I?" Not far away from Luo Zheng was a low-rank True God, who had sensed with his own soul power that the Soul-killing Ghosts were about to attack him. The whole thing was absolutely chaotic, and the True God became so anxious that he activated the Promise of Absolute Beginning on his chest.</p>

  <p>"Promise of Absolute Beginning!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, golden light appeared in the air and surrounded his whole body.</p>

  <p>That True God thought that he would be safe when he used the Promise of Absolute Beginning, but the hooks spiraled over and went straight into his mind. His body trembled, and soon enough the hooks had taken his soul away!</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he gritted his teeth in frustration and the lightning in his hand flashed. Then, he summoned a lightning ball and shot it towards the direction of the ghosts.</p>

  <p>Yet, the Soul-killing Ghosts were able to react quickly and scattered themselves everywhere when they noticed the lightning ball. They jumped high up before the lightning ball could land on the ground and simultaneously dragged the True God's soul with them as they left!</p>

  <p>"Explode!" shouted Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The lightning ball exploded in advance and covered a radius of about thirty feet.</p>

  <p>Even then, only three Soul-killing Ghosts were destroyed. The rest of them still managed to drag the True God's soul away and fled.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, a large group of Soul-killing Ghosts gathered together and fought viciously for the unlucky True God's soul.</p>

  <p>Despair filled Luo Zheng's eyes when he saw everything clearly. He helplessly shook his head and couldn't help but look away.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Promise of Absolute Beginning was powerful and precious, like Soren had said. However, the layer of golden light it created could only block the internal momentum in the divine land and any power from the three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Any kind of Divine Dao was useless against that golden light. On the other hand, the Soul-killing Ghosts' hooks were a type of soul attack, so activating the Promise of Absolute Beginning was not really effective.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the Promise of Absolute Beginning did not work on pure physical strength.</p>

  <p>The Might Divine Dao however, was a skill that used the power of the internal momentum to increase one's physical strength. No one knew exactly if the Promise of Absolute Beginning was effective against it.</p>

  <p>Such a theory needed further verification.</p>

  <p>Most True Gods were confident about using the Promise of Absolute Beginning after they had encountered the Abyss Demons, and thought that activating it would make them invincible. Therefore, many of them activated the Promise of Absolute Beginning in attempts to protect themselves? but little did they know that it would actually kill them!</p>

  <p>Only half a minute had passed since the Soul-killing Ghosts started to attack them, but there were already over twenty corpses under the Goddess Statue, whose souls had been destroyed. Over twenty True Gods had been killed, including a top-rank True God from the Liu Clan.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw eight or nine hooks fly in the air and come straight for him. In turn, he twisted his body and retreated backward. There was a loud bang after, followed by Liusu's scream from behind him.</p>

  <p>"These ghosts want your souls! You can climb onto the Goddess Statue to avoid them!" he looked back and shouted.</p>

  <p>After that, he saw Aleyna and Kelsey climb the tree stump below the Goddess Statue, and Langston already on the stump. Langston didn't think twice and grabbed Liusu's clothes and threw her onto the stump.</p>

  <p>"Ahh! Be careful of the hooks!" Liusu shouted as she was thrown into the air. She might have been angry at Luo Zheng, but she was never an unreasonable woman.</p>

  <p>They were already in a very dangerous situation, so how could she still have the heart to be mad at him?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and spread out his soul power as well. He didn't turn around, but he knew that several hooks were coming for his skull.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned around and rolled on the ground to avoid the lethal hooks.</p>

  <p>Everything was far from over though, as the hooks charged at him from another direction.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice, he had to evade them three times in a row and had now gotten further and further away from the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>A lightning ball materialized in his hand again while he rolled around and as soon as he got up, he immediately smashed the lightning ball into the ground.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Once again, the Soul-killing Ghosts had reacted too quickly. As soon as the lighting ball exploded, most of them had already escaped.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stood still, he saw that a large group of Soul-killing Ghosts had surrounded him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Gusts of cold wind blew around him as the ghosts gingerly crawled forward. They looked like they moved quite slowly, but they actually moved even faster than most True Gods.</p>

  <p>"My god! They did it on purpose!" he shouted desperately.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that after he'd dodged them so many times, he would still be forced into their circle! It seemed that they had planned everything well!</p>

  <p>"Run!!" Liusu shouted from the stump at the bottom of the Goddess Statue. "I would if I could?" Luo Zheng lamented.</p>

  <p>Despite his misery, he created another lightning ball.</p>

  <p>The Thunderstorm Divine Dao was really effective in dealing with these Soul-killing Ghosts, but these ghosts were very smart. When they noticed the lightning ball in Luo Zheng's hand, they avoided getting too close and threw their hooks at him from a certain distance.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the invisible hooks flew towards him with a burst of coldness.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw what they did, he threw the lightning ball directly at them and tried to get out of their encirclement as the lightning ball exploded.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he moved, the Soul-killing Ghosts also moved along with him, and even more Soul-killing Ghosts joined the encirclement.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he saw an agile figure not too far away, who continuously dodged the hooks as well. It seemed that the person saw the open space around him. The person jumped up and with a flash of red, landed firmly next to him. It was Nelly.</p>

  <p>She had been chased all the way by the ghosts as well. Even though she mastered the powerful Murdering Divine Dao, she found it difficult to deal with these Soul-killing Ghosts. She could kill them with the Ghost-killing Sword, but it was too dangerous to get close to them. A hook almost hit her just now!</p>

  <p>She saw an open space in front of her while she had been fleeing, so she quickly ran towards it. She didn't know that Luo Zheng was in the open space, which turned out to be a circle of the ghosts.</p>

  <p>Her face dimmed at the sight of the ever-increasing Soul-killing Ghosts.</p>

  <p>She tightly gripped her short sword, and couldn't help the uncertainty that washed over her.</p>
