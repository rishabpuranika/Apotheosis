<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2183 Malloy's Worries (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"No!" The girl didn't wait for Bruce's words to finish before she refused.</p>

  <p>A rebellious expression could be seen on her face.</p>

  <p>Bruce shook his head. "Miss, you have to keep your word." Although he was a servant, his tone was firm and there was no room for negotiation.</p>

  <p>A stern expression painted his face.</p>

  <p>The girl probably knew that she couldn't go against Bruce. Nonetheless, the pure eyes of hers fiercely stared at Luo Luo Zheng. With a face on the verge of a tantrum, she pouted her mouth and said, "Then, bring this brat back with us. If I didn't use the Veto Token to save him, I wouldn't have been exposed!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Han Clan's disciples slightly flashed as they stared enviously at Luo Luo Zheng. Deep in their hearts, everyone was jealous of how lucky Luo Luo Zheng was. After all, those two were from the Han Clan's Floating Island, and entering the Floating Island was their lifelong goal. If Luo Luo Zheng could really go to the Floating Island with the girl, then it would be having a skyrocketing rise.</p>

  <p>When Malloy and the other True Gods heard the girl's words, they grew anxious.</p>

  <p>The exam of the Heavenly Han House had yet to start, but Luo Luo Zheng had already shown his talent. Malloy had placed a great amount of hope on him. If Luo Luo Zheng really became a disciple of the Holy Emperor in the future, Malloy would benefit greatly. Furthermore, the status of the Heavenly Han House would be maintained for the time being. However, if Luo Luo Zheng entered the Floating Island without the accomplishment of the examination, he wouldn't be affiliated with the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>If the girl could really take Luo Luo Zheng away with her, then it would be a disaster for the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Before Bruce could speak, Malloy gathered up his courage. In a respectful tone, he said, "This person came to our Heavenly Han House and should be accepted by us as a disciple. How could he be taken away so casually?"</p>

  <p>Bruce looked at Malloy with a meaningful look on his face. In a callous voice, he replied, "We have no interest in him, but he does have extraordinary talent. I hope to see him on the Floating Island one day."</p>

  <p>"Grandpa Bruce!" the girl protested. A pout still lingered on her face.</p>

  <p>However, Bruce did not say anything. With a calm expression, he ignored the girl's tantrum. He reached out and a horsetail whisk appeared in his hand. With a gentle wave of the horsetail whisk, a cloud of dust suddenly appeared. Accompanied by gusts of wind, he and the girl disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>After the two of them left, Malloy and the others finally let out a sigh of relief. The stiff muscles on their faces finally relaxed. When they looked at Luo Luo Zheng again, Malloy felt slightly awkward.</p>

  <p>Malloy had long taken a fancy to Luo Luo Zheng and was bound to accept him as a disciple of the Heavenly Han House. Nonetheless, Luo Luo Zheng still needed to participate in the entire process of the exam. Without the completion of the process, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be properly affiliated with the Heavenly Han House. However, just now, when he argued with the girl, his intentions were revealed without a doubt. It was as if Malloy had already cut off Luo Zheng's path to the Floating Island, and he was afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would blame him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tianxing, if you join the Heavenly Han House, then in a few years, you'll be able to go to the Han Clan's Floating Island with your talent,"</p>

  <p>Malloy explained in a polite tone.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Malloy, a mid-rank True God, politely explained the situation to him, Luo Luo Zheng also sighed in his heart. The divine land and the Evolutionary Universe might be completely different in terms of the rules, but they were almost the same in terms of worldly experience.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I am indeed heading for the Floating Island, but my own path has been planned out long ago. Entering the Heavenly Han House is a necessary step. There are some shortcuts in this world, but I am not willing to take any of them," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile. A gentle expression could be seen in his face.</p>

  <p>Malloy's eyes lit up at Luo Zheng's words, and he could not help but nod in praise. "Good ambition! With this kind of mentality, there shouldn't be anything difficult for you in this world!"</p>

  <p>Malloy's words were sincere flattery. However, the others took it a bit differently.</p>

  <p>That was a chance to enter the Floating Island. Everyone in the yard wanted to go to that place.</p>

  <p>If Malloy didn't stop him, then Luo Luo Zheng would truly be able to go to the Floating island.</p>

  <p>The one hundred thousand proving godly warriors present could only wish in their nights of sleep about such a thing. None of them would be able to enter the Floating Island in their lifetime. However, Luo Luo Zheng was just only a step away from that dream!</p>

  <p>"I think this brat was just saying this to conceal his regret."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you. After losing this opportunity, he wants to go to the Floating Island on his own? In his dreams!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many geniuses in the Han Clan every year. Furthermore, they are much stronger than normal proving godly warriors. The Han Clan's Floating Island has rejected many talented warriors, including those from the sub-branches of the Han Clan. Yet Tianxing Luo wants to enter the Floating Island by himself? Not taking shortcuts? What nonsense! He is merely bluffing!"</p>

  <p>These people stood in different positions, and their thoughts were naturally different.</p>

  <p>Of course, they could not understand Luo Luo Zheng. It would be difficult for those warriors to reach certain heights in their entire lives. Naturally, they would not be able to see the wider world.</p>

  <p>    </p>
