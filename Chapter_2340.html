<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Divine Dao had already disappeared in the divine land for over a hundred divine eras.</p>

  <p>Even though a True God had a life span that couldn't expire, a hundred or so divine eras was still way too long.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that these True Gods in the valley knew the existence of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, and more importantly that it was forbidden, they had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>In recent years, only when Sword Chen fled to the Abyss Demon Region did people ever hear about the Emotion Closing Divine Dao again. It was otherwise a pretty full dead topic.</p>

  <p>Though that event wasn't sensational, many True Gods were aware of it.</p>

  <p>However, no one had seen Sword Chen again since he had fled into the Abyss Demon Region. In other words, the matter eventually blew over and no one really thought about it anymore.</p>

  <p>With the use of the Evolutionary Divine Arts, Luo Zheng had greatly increased his soul power and now, he displayed an extremely powerful soul pressure when using the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. Needless to say, the True Gods were all stunned!</p>

  <p>Prior to this occurrence, most of the True Gods were still worried that even if they fled to the Goddess Statue, the Soul-killing Ghosts would eventually catch up.</p>

  <p>In fact, the True Gods who had mastered the Divine Dao that were related to the thunder had been unable to kill these Soul-killing Ghosts. It was possible that they had taken for granted that, other than the top-rank True Gods, everyone else would be killed.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Zheng, who was working alone, chased a large group of Soul-killing Ghosts!</p>

  <p>"Is this guy really just a low-rank True God?" One of them spoke out.</p>

  <p>Standing in a daze, a mid-rank True God stared at Luo Zheng, who was running wildly through the valley after those Soul-killing Ghosts. According to this mid-rank True God's perception, Luo Zheng was quickly catching and killing off all the ghosts. So much so that it even looked like he had entered an empty area!</p>

  <p>Langston looked at Luo Zheng in the distance, with his eyelids twitching rhythmically. Even though he was unwilling to admit it, this guy was still much stronger than he had ever allowed himself to believe.</p>

  <p>After Nelly's soul returned to her original body, she quickly climbed onto the huge stump. Seeing Luo Zheng chasing those Soul-killing Ghosts in such a ferocious way made her heart fall, and she was amazed. 'That guy... Even his soul is much stronger than I have imagined, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>There was no emotion in Luo Zheng's eyes. As the golden light continued to flash, his soul pressure transformed itself into a rain of arrows that shot out and downward.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts relentlessly crawled on the ground. At last, Luo Zheng crushed them and turned their remnants into pure soul power, which continually entered his body and strengthened his own soul.</p>

  <p>Although a few True Gods standing on the stump released lightning that attacked certain Soul-killing Ghosts that were falling behind, the majority of them were killed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Luo Zheng had absorbed a massive amount of soul force. His soul was inevitably rapidly growing stronger!</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had killed the very last Soul-killing Ghost, he went directly back to the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>It was only when Luo Zheng had terminated his rampage that the True Gods on the stump jumped off, one after another. Many of the True Gods still felt very scared.</p>

  <p>Not far off in the distance, a few True Gods could be seen standing or lying on the ground, motionlessly.</p>

  <p>These True Gods' souls had been dug out from their bodies and torn to pieces. Hence, all they could do was stand there like statues. Since their souls had been extracted only a while ago, the vitality within their bodies had not quite been cut off yet. However, they had already turned into zombies, losing their own consciousness, which was equivalent to death.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" a True God holding a statue called out, with a mournful expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods came from the Floating Island of the same large clan and had blood relationship with each other. As their eyes fell upon the scene before them, it was only normal that they felt extremely sad.</p>

  <p>Reginald shook his head and sighed mournfully, "Transport these corpses directly out the Star Door..."</p>

  <p>"They aren't corpses!" a True God retorted loudly.</p>

  <p>Reginald simply shrugged his shoulders. In fact, to ascertain whether or not a True God had died, the most important thing was verifying if their soul had been killed. Even if a True God's body had turned into pieces, as long as their soul remained intact, there would eventually be a chance for them to come back to life. If their soul vanished, though, that was another story, and they were truly hopeless.</p>

  <p>The True Gods cleared up the scene quickly and carried those bodies out the Star Door.</p>

  <p>It was suddenly very quiet in the valley, and most of the True Gods kept silent. No one dared speak in such a sad moment.</p>

  <p>The majority of the True Gods obtained no substantial benefit from resisting the Soul-killing Ghosts' attacks. They didn't even receive a divine might coin from doing so. The only ones that had gained benefit from this were the True Gods who had killed Soul-killing Ghosts! Their soul force, like Luo Zheng's, had grown quite a lot, too.</p>

  <p>Of course, among them all, Luo Zheng was the one whose strength had grown the most.</p>

  <p>He had killed more than three fourths of the Soul-killing Ghosts on his own, and continued to retrieve their pure and precious soul power. It was only expected that his soul strength would grow significantly!</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's mind, Master Evil was staring blankly at Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>After the death of Master Evil's physical body, he had seen Luo Zheng use those small soul arrows to tear apart Yorick's soul.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Zheng had only been a proving godly warrior and yet, he had broken a mid-rank True God's soul.</p>
