<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Iron Tribe...</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Zheng with mixed emotions, Zelda couldn't help feeling embarrassed. "Congratulations! It's only been a month but see how far you've come. You've already cultivated to such level."</p>

  <p>Clearly, the five hundred wild bones that Luo Zheng gave Zelda also improved her cultivation by leaps and bounds during this period of time.</p>

  <p>However, her utilization rate of the wild bones appeared to be far less than that of Luo Zheng's. Her absorbing five hundred wild bones would have been equivalent to Luo Zheng absorbing about a hundred and seventy, but getting the exact same effect.</p>

  <p>Zelda could only grow up to two hundred-odd feet, but Luo Zheng already surpassed her as he could turn to a six hundred feet high Wild God.</p>

  <p>How could she not be jealous of his fast improvement? Giving out a silent sigh, Zelda finally looked away.</p>

  <p>"I think I was just lucky. If I didn't get that blood wild bone, I wouldn't have cultivated so fast." Luo Zheng smiled lightly, glancing back at her.</p>

  <p>"You're so modest. Having luck on your side can also be an advantage,"</p>

  <p>Zelda said with a determined look in her eyes, and then she asked,</p>

  <p>"Before you leave, can I ask you a favor?"</p>

  <p>Looking at Zelda's face, Luo Zheng asked noncommittally, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>He knew that Zelda's and Luther's background might be more complicated than he could imagine, but he did not have much time to care about such things right now.</p>

  <p>"First, can you promise me that you will definitely help me?" Zelda asked with a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng refused without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Zelda pursed her lips, probably anticipating Luo Zheng's answer even before he said it out loud. After a moment, she finally said, "But I think this will be a great opportunity for you. It can even help you escape the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>"Light of Adjudication?" Luo Zheng repeated. It was the first time that he had heard of that term. "What's that?" Luo Zheng asked curiously, looking back at her.</p>

  <p>Zelda shook her head at his ignorance. "Now I really suspect that you're not from this world. It's so strange that you didn't even know about the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. He knew for a fact that he was indeed from another world, so he didn't defend himself.</p>

  <p>"In this world, everyone is striving to enter the bone towers. Do you want to know why every force and every clan in this land want to occupy the bone towers?" Zelda asked, lowering down her volume as if it was a secret she was imparting.</p>

  <p>Staring at her, Luo Zheng shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"Because the Wild Gods outside the bone towers won't live for more than a thousand years." Standing up, Zelda looked at the boundless world outside the house. "All these people and living creatures outside the bone towers have a limited life span. It can never exceed a thousand years.</p>

  <p>Everyone outside the bone towers are pariahs, including you and me."</p>

  <p>"A life span of only one thousand years? What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>Hearing that for the first time, Luo Zheng couldn't hide his curiosity. His brows furrowed as he tried to make sense of what Zelda just said.</p>

  <p>Now that she mentioned it, Luo Zheng had indeed noticed that all the Wild Gods in the Sand Core City were not that old. And not just that, even the old people in the Sand Core City were only about seven or eight hundred years old.</p>

  <p>While in the divine land, any True God that Luo Zheng had met had lived several divine eras.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Wild Gods in this world would be as young as babies.</p>

  <p>Although he had been a little curious, he did not go deep into this question.</p>

  <p>"Because the Light of Adjudication erupts every one thousand years, killing all living creatures in sight. Its light will spread over the world, and will make everything vanish," Zelda said faintly.</p>

  <p>"The Light of Adjudication? Once every thousand years?" Luo Zheng was stunned hearing Zelda's explanation.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "To avoid it, one must reach those bone towers. It's the only safe place that can protect people from the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>"So people can only survive in the bone towers?" Raising his head, Luo Zheng looked into the great distance from where he stood and towards the direction of the bone towers.</p>

  <p>They appeared to be hundreds or even billions of miles away in the horizon from where he was standing. Looking at them from such a distance, it was very obscure.</p>

  <p>"Yes, all major forces fought to gain control of every bone tower," Zelda replied.</p>

  <p>"It's true that the bone towers can save people's lives, but why don't you just choose to leave here?" Luo Zheng ended up asking.</p>

  <p>So far, the strength of the Wild Gods that Luo Zheng had seen might be ordinary. For example, although Zelda was a low-rank Wild God, her true combat strength was about the same as that of a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng saw those Wild Gods that were a thousand miles high, he assumed that they could be comparable to the consummate True Gods. In this world, it wouldn't surprise him if some Wild Gods who existed were even stronger than Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"That's not as easy as you think," Zelda said helplessly. "This world is a huge prison. Every living being born in this world is connected to the Curse Chain. No matter how powerful they are, it's impossible for them to leave..."</p>

  <p>"A huge prison..." Luo Zheng whispered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remembered how his mother talked about this world being a huge place of exile and how everyone had been cursed by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>What she said was about the same as the prison that Zelda was talking about. But he had never heard of the Curse Chain.</p>

  <p>"What is the Curse Chain? You said every living being is linked to it, but I couldn't see it," Luo Zheng said. "If there is really such a thing, why have I not heard about it before?"</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, Zelda answered, "Everyone outside the bone towers are drifting through life. It's impossible for them to know about the existence of the Curse Chain. However, there's no escaping fate. As soon as the time limit of one thousand years expires, everyone will die. The next reincarnation will give birth to numerous pariahs once again..."</p>

  <p>"Wait," Luo Zheng interrupted Zelda. "Do you mean that countless pariahs will be born every thousand years? How are they born into this world?"</p>

  <p>In a thousand years, maybe it could produce some low-level creatures.</p>

  <p>But for human beings and other large creatures, it would be impossible for them to appear again after just a short time.</p>

  <p>These creatures might take hundreds to millions or even billions of years to reappear from the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>If the Light of Adjudication would kill all the people, then only those great powers and clans in the bone towers would survive.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zelda's words were untenable as Luo Zheng couldn't figure out how numerous pariahs could be born in the next incarnation.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen the Wights crawling in the Immemorial Wilderness?" Zelda asked.</p>

  <p>"You mean..." Luo Zheng had a speculation in his mind.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "Yes. All of the pariahs are developed from those Wights when they gain wisdom. Those Wights won't be killed by the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>In this world, the Wights were like zombies.</p>

  <p>After the Light of Adjudication wiped out all the pariahs, a new group of Wights would gain wisdom and become the new pariahs.</p>

  <p>A small number of these pariahs had strong talent, or sometimes, their children had good talent. If they were lucky, these talents might be able to attract the attention of some great forces, making them qualified to enter the bone towers. And the most important of it all, they would be able to extend their lives and escape the limitation of a thousand years' lifespan.</p>

  <p>Hearing such a secret, Luo Zheng was dumbfounded. He didn't expect that the world was far more complicated than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>By comparison, this place was countless times more cruel than the divine land.</p>

  <p>"As for the Curse Chain, there are no more than thirty people in this world who could see it." Blinking her eyes, Zelda looked at Luther, who was a few feet away from where they were. "My brother is one of them."</p>

  <p>Curling his lips, Luther asked, "Do you want to see it? I can help you."</p>

  <p>Somehow, an ominous premonition arose from Luo Zheng's heart. "Am I also bound by the Curse Chain?" he immediately asked.</p>

  <p>He was not from this world, so logically he wouldn't be bound by the Curse Chain, but this was a strange world and everything was possible.</p>
