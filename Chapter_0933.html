<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yolande rolled her eyes and weighed her possible replies. The grey pupils in her watery eyes moved rapidly, making it seem like there were two snowflakes embedded inside her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I know," she finally said.</p>

  <p>"So you also know why I'm here?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Yes, I'm very clear about why you're here. But you're just an outsider who doesn't know the truth."</p>

  <p>"An outsider?" Luo Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Mist's luck is not bad. I didn't think that he would be willing to stay in the celestial tomb for so many years and sacrifice the chance of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>He was lucky that there finally came a person with the fate to lead the great world of chaos," Yolande said seriously. "But he didn't tell you the whole story."</p>

  <p>"What is the whole story?" It was true that Luo Zheng knew little about this whole matter. He didn't even know what the inheritance that he was pursuing exactly was.</p>

  <p>"You have your own path, so I don't recommend you getting involved in this game," Yolande said.</p>

  <p>"What is the game?" Luo Zheng asked. Judging from Yolande's tone, it seemed that he had been involved in a big dispute from the time he had left the Central Region and gone into the Sea God Continent. Now, it seemed that Xun's guess had been right. This dispute was most likely a dispute within the human race as well as a dispute in the Upper World. It seemed that Mist and Yolande were not on the same side after all. Luo Zheng had no idea what was going on.</p>

  <p>Yolande sighed. "It's a dead end."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened. "Can you explain it clearly?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to explain." Yolande shook her head and took two steps toward Luo Zheng. Then, she took a deep breath before turning her lips up into a smile. It was a rare sight to see. "But since you've already come to this stage, you'll also have a part to play. I just hope that you'll make the right judgment after getting the inheritance and have a clear mind about the path you want to take!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I know which path I want to take," Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>No matter what the game was or what kind of dispute they were in, Luo Zheng would always stick to his own path and would not be easily influenced by others. No matter how the immortal Mist or Yolande wanted to take advantage of him, he would always make sure that they didn't hinder his path.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about whether they were on the righteous side or not. It had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Yolande nodded. "The road for those who have the fate to lead a world of chaos will always be their own path. Changing your path will be as difficult as changing the trajectory of the stars. Perhaps entering the Dark Nether Cave is a step in your path and I've unknowingly become your guide."</p>

  <p>What Yolande had just said was so mysterious that it confused not just Luo Zheng, but everyone else as well.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and Yolande spoke, they were approaching the enormous abyss.</p>

  <p>The abyss and the beast hadn't seemed far away at first. But even though they'd been traveling for a long time, it seemed that they had gotten only a little closer. The huge beast that was lying on the side of the abyss was gradually getting bigger and bigger. But from here, it was impossible to tell exactly how big the beast was.</p>

  <p>After flying close to the ground for four hours, they finally arrived at the edge of the abyss.</p>

  <p>Everyone suddenly felt insignificant compared to the huge abyss that lay before them.</p>

  <p>To be precise, what lay before them was more of a gap in the earth than an abyss. Even if a piece of land as large as a country was used to fill the gap, it would hardly suffice. On the other side of the abyss lay the giant beast.</p>

  <p>There were numerous spikes on its huge body, which extended from the edge of the abyss all the way to the bottomless pit beneath. They didn't have any idea how big the beast was as the abyss was too deep and they couldn't see where the beast ended.</p>

  <p>Although Yolande had said that this vicious beast was called Mad Scorpion and that it was the watchdog of hell, it didn't look anything like a dog to Luo Zheng. In his eyes, it was more like a dragon or a snake.</p>

  <p>"Does this enormous abyss lead to hell?" A trace of fear appeared in Malcom's eyes.</p>

  <p>Ever since becoming a war sage, he'd had a good plan for his future. He knew that since he was a war sage now, he would never be able to leave the Tower of Sin again. Outside the Tower of Sin was the Cursed Land, and at his current cultivation level, he would surely die as soon as he stepped on it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was impossible to build a transmission array in the Tower of Sin. In other words, Malcom would never be able to leave the Tower of Sin and the Dark Nether Cave for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>However, he'd never thought of it as a problem. As long as he could stay in the Tower of Sin, he could continuously improve his strength and make breakthroughs. Making a breakthrough to become a war sage definitely wasn't the last of it. He could still reach the Soul Sea Realm and higher levels than that.</p>

  <p>Once he became stronger, he would be able to acquire all the fortune in the Dark Nether Cave. After that, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to leave the Cursed Land. This had been his plan after becoming a war sage.</p>

  <p>But now, as the brutal truth stared him in the eye, he realized that he had underestimated the Dark Nether Cave. Forget about the Soul Sea Realm� even if he was a hundred times stronger than a Soul Sea Realm warrior, it would still be difficult for him to survive in the core area, let alone take the fortune inside!</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head and said coldly, "People think that hell is the place where ghosts live. The so-called hell is actually just a door."</p>

  <p>"A door? Then this is�" Malcom started to ask again.</p>

  <p>But before he could finish, Yolande interrupted him. "If you want to know where this abyss leads to, you can try jumping in."</p>

  <p>Malcom glared at her with his fist-sized eyes. They were all enveloped by the Dark Nether Death Light. It was bad enough that if he left Zheng's orange shield, he would die immediately under the Dark Nether Death Light. Now, Yolande was suggesting for him to jump into the abyss. What a joke!</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Take out the Jade Butterfly," Yolande ordered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached into his space ring and took out the Jade Butterfly. The flame that burst forth from the Jade Butterfly startled everyone. They subconsciously moved to the side to avoid being burned by the flame.</p>

  <p>However, the flame didn't hurt Luo Zheng. The Jade Butterfly in his hand was like a little spirit that danced in the air. A shower of sparks flew out from it, emitting dazzling light.</p>

  <p>"And then?" Luo Zheng asked as he held the Jade Butterfly.</p>

  <p>"Throw it down," Yolande said calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paused, looking hesitant. The Jade Butterfly had been handed to him by the immortal Mist and it carried the great mission of getting the inheritance in the Dark Nether Cave. What would happen if he threw the Jade Butterfly down just like that?</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's hesitant expression, Yolande blinked her eyes and said calmly,</p>

  <p>"Do you know why Mist didn't explain anything to you?"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also curious about this.</p>

  <p>Back then, when the immortal Mist had handed Luo Zheng the Jade Butterfly, the only thing he had said to Luo Zheng was that Luo Zheng would have to go down the Tower of Sin and obtain some important inheritance. After that, he'd sent Luo Zheng to the Sea God Continent without saying anything else.</p>

  <p>How to obtain the inheritance, how to enter the core area, how to use the Jade Butterfly� he hadn't explained any of these things.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was a great talent with a powerful destiny, it was impossible for him to figure out how to use the Jade Butterfly all by himself.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled and turned to Malcom. "There was once a top-level war lord named Huey in your ogre race, right?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this name, Malcom and Rehaan nodded at the same time. Although Huey wasn't very powerful in terms of cultivation level, he was famous within the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. In fact, Malcom and Rehaan weren't the only ones who knew him. Fabian, Jarrod, and Esther had all heard of Huey before.</p>

  <p>This was because this top-level war lord called Huey had controlled the Tower of Sin for over a hundred years!</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the top-level war lords in the Tower of Sin would do their best to suppress their cultivation. When they accumulated enough Lucky Light, they would leave the Tower of Sin to break through. It proved to be a very effective way for warriors to bypass the bottleneck in their cultivation. Therefore, the top-level war lords who walked out of the Tower of Sin would have no problem making a breakthrough to become war sages.</p>

  <p>However, suppressing cultivation was not an easy thing. After suppressing it for a long time, it was also possible for one to break through automatically. Therefore, when many top-level war lords felt that they were about to break through, they would leave the Tower of Sin and the Cursed Land. If they accidentally broke through and became war sages inside the Tower of Sin, it was equivalent to courting death.</p>

  <p>However, there had once been a freak in the ogre race, and that was none other than Huey.</p>

  <p>Huey had kept his cultivation level at the top-level war lord for over a hundred years. During that time, he had been the strongest seat holder in the Tower of Sin. The ogre race had been able to control the Tower of Sin for a long time, and more than half the credit for that went to Huey.</p>

  <p>As for how Huey had managed to suppress his cultivation and remain as a top-level war lord for over a hundred years, it was a huge mystery to all living creatures.</p>

  <p>Huey had been so strong back then that he could be considered the actual controller of the Tower of Sin. Therefore, even the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had had to pay respect to him despite the fact that he was only a top-level war lord!</p>
