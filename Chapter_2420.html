  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were only few True Gods in the divine land that had the chance to see the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't stop the many legends of the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The most interested were the True Gods who came to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao and passed the first round of screening.</p>

  <p>There were various reasons why these True Gods, who were all originally extremely talented people, still made no breakthroughs in their cultivation.</p>

  <p>It took a lot of resources to consummate a True God and it was extremely difficult even for the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. If they didn't have other chances, they might never be able to become consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The ethereal Truth of Divine Dao was their life saver.</p>

  <p>If one could fully understand a Truth of Divine Dao, they would be able to cross the Divine Dao and reach the other shore. It was the complete comprehension of the ultimate mysteries of the world.</p>

  <p>Various rumors had spread among the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Later on, many opinions were formed about the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Through sheer coincidence, there had been a few True Gods who managed to decipher one or two sentences of the abridged versions of the Truth of Divine Dao. They all claimed that they were enchanted and felt wonderful as they read.</p>

  <p>But a few words were nothing but a glance at the end of the Divine Dao. It wasn't any help but was a deadly temptation.</p>

  <p>A solid proof of the Truth of Divine Dao was the Non-combat Zone, a special existence in the Sunrest Tree Region.</p>

  <p>Neither the Holy Beings nor the consummate True Gods could afford to ignore the Truth of Divine Dao contained within.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan took advantage of the True Gods' intense yearning for the place to hold a debate over the Divine Dao every few years.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods who studied Sanskrit words would participate in the debate, but most of them couldn't pass the first round of screening.</p>

  <p>Even more candidates were eliminated in the second round.</p>

  <p>There were over ten thousand True Gods in the hall but only a few of them were able to pass.</p>

  <p>"There's still one thing that I have to remind you. There will be some dirty tricks in the second round of screening and certain dangers will be present.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who have participated in the debates before should know that," the Sword Clan's elder said flatly.</p>

  <p>The hearts of the True Gods felt cold at the words.</p>

  <p>Although they were at the Non-combat Zone, it didn't mean absolute safety.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had occupied the Sunrest Tree for a long time, so their study of the Non-combat Zone was deeper than the outside world imagined.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had died in the previous debates.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and thought, 'We can't fight in the Non-combat Zone but that doesn't mean we can't kill each other.'</p>

  <p>For example, when he held some Truth Spiritual Swords in the Famous Sword Divine City, they still managed to badly hurt Rufus.</p>

  <p>'In this case, the Truth of Divine Dao in the Non-combat Zone is to suppress killing intent. That's to say, it's impossible for me to deliberately kill someone unless I get rid of the Truth of Divine Dao in the Non-combat Zone. But that doesn't mean that I really can't kill them.'</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng carefully studied the situation, the old man of the Sword Clan spoke again, "Everyone, please follow me."</p>

  <p>He led the way out the hall.</p>

  <p>The True Gods closely followed after him.</p>

  <p>The dark-skinned man walked in front of Luo Zheng and turned back to smile at him. "It seems like you're a newcomer to the debate. Bill Sword's not joking. You may die if you're careless in the second round. It's not too late for you to withdraw!"</p>

  <p>His voice boomed as he tried to frighten Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The man had participated in the debate seven times and had been to the second round five times. He could be considered as an old friend of the Sword Clan, but he wasn't able to seriously participate in the debate all the time. It was a heavy weight in his heart as it was such a loss.</p>

  <p>Newcomers without a high cultivation level, like Luo Zheng, were hammered down and doing that made the weight in his heart lighter.</p>

  <p>Contrary to what the man expected, Luo Zheng didn't care about his words at all.</p>

  <p>He just asked, "Bill Sword? This consummate True God of the Sword Clan should have the surname Mo, right?"</p>

  <p>"Well, most of the members of the Sword Clan are surnamed Mo, but those who have made great contributions to the Sword Clan, those that have become consummate True Gods, and some of the core members of the Sword Clan all have unique titles. For example, this old man is titled Bill Sword," the dark-skinned man explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh... I see. Thank you," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! Let me tell you, if you don't quit at the second round of screening, you'll definitely die." The man was even angrier when he realized that Luo Zheng was distracting him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes and ignored him again.</p>

  <p>"Bill Sword..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>There was a skeleton of a consummate True God of the Sword Clan in the jade seal that Luo Zheng had taken.</p>

  <p>The owner of the skeleton was Mikail Sword.</p>

  <p>If he could find the opportunity, Luo Zheng would definitely return Mikail's dead body to the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>The dark-skinned man didn't know what Luo Zheng was thinking about.</p>

  <p>Even if he was being ignored, the man kept muttering by Luo Zheng's ear and no one understood why he was especially pressuring Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Stop talking crap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and rebuked loudly.</p>

  <p>The crowd quieted down as they all suddenly stopped and looked at Luo Zheng and the man.</p>

  <p>Even Bill, who was leading the way, turned around to frown at them and said, "Please keep quiet."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and didn't say anything more.</p>

  <p>But the man felt quite embarrassed.</p>

  <p>If it had been outside of the Non-combat Zone, he would have killed Luo Zheng immediately. But the moment his killing intention formed, it had instantly dissipated due to the invisible force from the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>In the end, he could only glare at Luo Zheng without saying anything.</p>

  <p>They followed a downward path under Bill's lead and they stopped at a dark entrance.</p>

  <p>As he stood at the entrance, Bill said, "This is where the Sword Clan cultivates. It's well known that we built the Non-combat Zone because we cherish lives but no one knows that we can also sacrifice lives. This is the Killing Zone."</p>

  <p>The Truth of Divine Dao that enveloped the whole Non-combat Zone was exceptionally extreme.</p>

  <p>The True Gods couldn't even fight with each other in areas covered by that aura.</p>

  <p>But the opposite side of the Non-combat Zone was the Killing Zone.</p>
