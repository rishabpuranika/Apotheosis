<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1610 Battle Between Two Giants </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Meow..." the little flame kitten whimpered pitifully in the Frosty Cage.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, this big guy can't even eat you!"</p>

  <p>Standing on top of the Lava Giant's head, Janet sweetly comforted the flame kitten.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon after, Hailey and Jeffrey jumped onto the Lava Giant's head as well.</p>

  <p>"Don't eat me!"</p>

  <p>Coleman roared as he followed suit and jumped onto the head.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, the Lava Giant suddenly cried out. A powerful force of suction suddenly erupted from its large mouth.</p>

  <p>Two warriors stood on its shoulders? one was Ansel from the Night Group while the other was Ran Li, a human.</p>

  <p>Before they could even jump, they were suddenly pulled toward the Lava Giant's mouth.</p>

  <p>"AH!"</p>

  <p>The human warrior leapt with all his might, unable to avoid the vacuum-like force. He couldn't help but scream in terror as his body was pulled down the Lava Giant's throat.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ansel didn't jump high, but instead rolled over the shoulder of the Lava Giant, rolling towards its neck, effectively avoiding the attack.</p>

  <p>"Another one has died!"</p>

  <p>Though they had only just managed to enter the fourth Hall of Causality, they lost another warrior, leaving them with only six.</p>

  <p>It was just as Janet said? the more people in the Hall of Causality, the better. Only by working together could people hope to pass the increasingly difficult trials. Still, the death of some was unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Ansel vigilantly rolled onto the Lava Giant's neck, quickly climbing up the left side of its face, joining Luo Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>"Woo!"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant tried shaking its head but the top of its head was spacious? even if its head was tilted, it would still be very difficult to get a warrior off of it.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" Coleman asked in urgency.</p>

  <p>While the top of the Lava Giant's head was wide open, it definitely wasn't a place one could rest easily. Its two arms were ready to start swinging toward the top of its head.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng gazed into the distance, he tried to come up with something quick.</p>

  <p>There was more than one Lava Giant in the magma lake. From where he stood, he could see over ten Lava Giants standing side by side in the lake.</p>

  <p>Originally Luo Luo Zheng wanted to use the flame kitten to lure the Lava Giants in one by one, using them as bridges so that they could all make it to the other side.</p>

  <p>But he soon realized that the Lava Giants would make that too difficult a plan to materialize.</p>

  <p>If one wasn't cautious enough, one could easily be swatted to death by the Lava Giant like a mere mosquito.</p>

  <p>"Time to leave. This Lava Giant's hand is coming closer," Hailey said softly, staring at the path the Lava Giant's arm was moving in.</p>

  <p>Although its movements were slow, relatively, it wasn't slow enough for the warriors to outrun it, not even at Luo Zheng's speed. If they didn't make a run for it before the Lava Giant's hand hit them, it would be too late for them to dodge.</p>

  <p>"Take this little flame kitten? Throw it out!"</p>

  <p>A bright light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes at this moment.</p>

  <p>"What?" But Janet couldn't tell what he meant.</p>

  <p>"Elongate the Lofty Wood. Stretch it out as far as you can and throw the kitten out like you're fishing!" Luo Luo Zheng didn't bother explaining himself? he wasn't certain his idea would work, but he decided to take things one step at a time.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Janet extended the Lofty Wood in her hand, pushing out the Frosty Cage at the top.</p>

  <p>With everything happening so fast, Jeffrey was the first to come to a realization.</p>

  <p>Lava Giants weren't particularly smart. Janet's extension of the Lofty Wood would have the flame kitten hang right in front of the Lava Giant, drawing in its attention.</p>

  <p>When the Lava Giant caught sight of the kitten, its arms changed course to grab it.</p>

  <p>"A little longer!"</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>The plan was simple? Janet also caught on.</p>

  <p>The carter hung the carrot in front of the donkey to keep it moving? with the carrot out of the donkey's reach, it chased after the food, pulling the cart forward.</p>

  <p>Such was an ancient method.</p>

  <p>Although the Lava Giant was powerful and almost physically unbeatable, the warriors had a chance by outwitting it.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant's hands clapped but failed to catch the flame kitten in front of it. Janet then raised the wood in her hand high up as if raising a fishing rod. Then, the Lofty Wood stretched out to six to seven thousand feet long, hanging the kitten far ahead in front of the Lava Giant, beyond the reach of its arms.</p>

  <p>"Woo! Woo!"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant, however, didn't think to pull on the thin Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>Unable to reach the flame kitten, it took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the Lava Giant took a rumbling step forward, Luo Luo Zheng, Hailey, and Jeffrey all looked at each other with triumphant faces.</p>

  <p>The plan actually worked.</p>

  <p>"This Lava Giant? It's so stupid," Janet remarked with a smile. Tightly holding onto the thin Lofty Wood in her hand, she gave the pitiful flame kitten an apologetic look as she said, "I'm sorry, you have to stay hanging there for now!"</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>Whimpering, the little flame kitten was extremely terrified. It could only watch in fear as the Lava Giant took steps toward it, unable to close the gap between them.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>With every step of the Lava Giant, the magma lake rippled, making everyone feel the rapid rise in temperature.</p>

  <p>The group then used the Lava Giant as a free carrier, slowly advancing across the lake.</p>

  <p>"It seems I've overestimated the Lava Giant's intelligence."</p>

  <p>In this position, Janet could control even the Lava Giant's direction. So long as she held the Lofty Wood in her hand, the Lava Giant would follow wherever she turned it. The little flame kitten seemed to be the only thing on the Lava Giant's mind at the moment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze landed on the other Lava Giants. "These Lava Giants have formed a row themselves. They're even equally spaced. Perhaps using them as a bridge is really the way to get across this lake. We may have found a shortcut."</p>

  <p>No one could just force their way through the Hall of Causality. To pass through it meant making the most out of its rules.</p>

  <p>But they had found such an easy method? perhaps this could be considered an oversight in the hall's set-up.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the attraction of the flame kitten, the Lava Giant brought them all the way to the center of the lake. With its wide strides, they would get across the lake in no time. But it wasn't certain that crossing the lake meant passing the fourth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Woo! Woo!"</p>

  <p>Just when everyone thought they could rest easy, the tables were turned.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the other Lava Giants hadn't reacted at all as they passed through. But one Lava Giant seemed to finally notice the flame kitten in the air and decided to walk over.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" It was a shock, even for Luo Luo Zheng. Attracting one Lava Giant worked well enough for them, but attracting the other Lava Giants would only bring them trouble.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Perhaps that Lava Giant spotted my little flame kitten,"</p>

  <p>Janet said with a frown as she gripped harder around the Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>"There are quite a few of these things in the magma lake. Go find something else!" Jeffrey called out to the other Lava Giant, looking sullen.</p>

  <p>But if the Lava Giant was intelligent enough to understand their words, they wouldn't be in such trouble. After the Lava Giants found the kitten, they would immediately try to catch and swallow it. From a certain perspective, such was also a rule in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The other Lava Giant took a step forward and pounced at the kitten hung in the air.</p>

  <p>This enraged the Lava Giant beneath Luo Zheng's feet. Instead of going for the kitten, it brandished its two giant fists and rammed them into the other Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>A fight between such huge monsters was like two mountains crashing into each other.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get down!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The tremors brought Luo Luo Zheng and the others down to the scalp of the Lava Giant's head. Grabbing a few protruding stone pillars or cracks on top of its head was their only security from being thrown off because of the vibrations.</p>

  <p>They were right in the middle of the magma lake? if anyone fell, they'd completely burn.</p>
