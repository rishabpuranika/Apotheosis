<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall's main focus was to bring forth stronger warriors. Its income depended largely on the missions they gave out.</p>

  <p>A portion of the rewards from the missions would go to the disciples who completed their tasks successfully, but the majority of the benefits acquired during the missions would be in the hands of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, despite Cloud Hall's steady completion of its missions, this method of earning money fell behind to that of the large clans.</p>

  <p>The clans all had their own trades and businesses— some of which extended to mines, banks, escort agencies, and even brothels. The transmission arrays of the Cloudy City were under their jurisdiction as well. Anyone who used the transmission arrays had to pay a considerable sum of money.</p>

  <p>On top of all this, there were tens of millions of mortals in the Cloudy City. The mortals could not compare with the warriors, and the money they traded with was usually gold and silver. However, if one gathered all of the gold and silver in the city, it would amount to an astronomical sum. Gold and silver could be exchanged into low-grade life vitality crystals, and then into mid-grade life vitality crystals, and would then fall into the hands of the clans.</p>

  <p>These clans could not afford to take out 20, 000 supreme life vitality crystals in one go. Even Cloud Hall wouldn't be able to do it, but it didn't matter. Zheng's plan was simple. The clans could agree to a contract of payment with Cloud Hall. Installments could also be arranged.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget to pay the interest!" Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>At his words, the leaders of the clans shifted in their spots, the corners of their mouths twitching. Yudie was already ruthless enough, and now here was Zheng. The younger generation was terrifying. They had cultivated their skills in a pace that had never been seen before, and their talent and strength were more than formidable. And as if that wasn't enough, they were both merciless.</p>

  <p>The clan leaders understood that it was the price they had to pay. They had risen up in rebellion against the Cloud Hall, but they had failed. This was the consequence of their failure. They had risked in a gamble, and it was time to pay the piper.</p>

  <p>After some time of discussion, the clan leaders rushed back home to prepare the life vitality crystals. Zheng, on the other hand, went straight to Cloud Hall. Until today, he did not have much time to meet up with Tianming and the others since he had been preoccupied with worrying about Letitita. Now that he had some time on his hands, he couldn't wait to see them and catch up.</p>

  <p>In truth, Yudie wanted to stop Zheng, but she merely swallowed her words and said nothing.</p>

  <p>The dull and lifeless expression on the young woman's face did not escape Saint Morphens' notice. Yudie's eyes were absent and downcast, and her shoulders drooped like the petals of a wilting flower. He said nothing as he observed her discreetly. It wouldn't be wise for him to get involved in her personal issues.</p>

  <p>The sound of laughter and cheerful chattering rose from a small pavilion in Cloud Hall. Zheng, Tianming, Patrick, and Lewis gathered together in merriment. On the table were various delicious dishes, and wine flowed like a river. With their cultivation, they didn't need to worry about being intoxicated. Not even a hundred buckets of wine could make them drunk.</p>

  <p>The men had been separated for years, and they were finally all back together.</p>

  <p>Tianming downed all the wine in his cup in one gulp. He wiped the liquid on the corners of his mouth away with his sleeve before saying, "I thought that since I had activated the Sword Eye, I might be able to win against you. But it seems that I've overestimated myself." He smiled wryly as he spoke.</p>

  <p>This was indeed Tianming. He would never admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Back at Cloud Sect, Tianming had regarded Patrick and Zheng as his greatest opponents. He trained day in and day out, determined to defeat them.</p>

  <p>When he entered Cloud Hall, he was able to gradually surpass Patrick.</p>

  <p>However, during the Martial Arts Contest in Oracle City, Tianming saw just how large the gap was between him and Zheng. And it seemed to be larger and larger with the passing of time.</p>

  <p>Even so, giving up was the last thing on his mind. The knowledge of the difference between him and Zheng spurred him like fuel to a fire, and he kept on training to master the Heavenly Sword that he had cultivated.</p>

  <p>Finally, Tianming had activated the Sword Eye, and he was able to accumulate the power of the heavens.</p>

  <p>With this power, his strength had magnified by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>There was no one else in the entire Central Region who could kill three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm with only a single sword strike.</p>

  <p>But he did it. What was even more frightening was that Tianming was only at the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. A warrior at the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm was equal to a level five or level six war general. Even Zheng was not able to achieve such a feat when he was at this level.</p>

  <p>With his newfound power, Tianming had felt that he could fight against Zheng now. However, Zheng was nowhere to be found. For a long time, no one knew his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that two years later, Zheng would appear again, and that he had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm? It was as if every time Tianming took one step forward, Zheng leaped ten. The distance between them was only lengthening every time.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, don't belittle yourself. You are already strong as it is. If you are able to accumulate enough energy for your Sword Eye, not even a warrior at the Life and Death Realm would be able to block it, let alone one at the Virtual Tribulation Realm," Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>But Tianming shook his head and said, "I know my own strength.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there are limited conditions for using the Sword Eye. I can only strike with it once. In theory, yes. Its power would be enough to defeat higher level warriors. But in an actual battle, I would have no time to stab out with my sword for the second time. If the opponent is as experienced as you, he would no doubt be able to dodge my first strike."</p>

  <p>Even the greatest power had its limits. Tianming knew that his Heavenly Sword was indeed strong, but it had its flaws. There was a reason for the large gap between the strength of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm and one only at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>As long as his opponent was able to dodge his first strike, Tianming would be nothing more than an ordinary warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head at Tianming's words; there was no point in being modest, and Tianming was a man of pride. It was true when he said that Zheng would be able to dodge his first strike.</p>

  <p>"I can dodge it too!" Lewis chimed in. He was quite confident in his own body movement skill.</p>

  <p>Tianming threw a cold glance at Lewis and sneered, "You can indeed dodge my first sword strike, and then what?"</p>

  <p>Lewis' body movement skill was indeed hard to predict. Even some warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm found it difficult to execute it to such an extent. However, rather than be called a body movement skill, it was probably more fitting to be called a running-for-your-life skill.</p>

  <p>Lewis' strength was far inferior to Tianming's. Even if he could dodge the first strike, Tianming would still defeat him in strength.</p>

  <p>At Tianming's words, Lewis immediately fell silent and crumpled back docilely into his seat. On the other hand, a gentle smile appeared on Patrick's face. He was already used to this banter between the two men.</p>

  <p>"By the way, I've come back this time with gifts for you," Zheng suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"Gifts? What are they?" Lewis immediately perked up at the mention of presents as he stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"There shouldn't be any for you," Tianming coldly stated again.</p>

  <p>A pitiful look appeared on Lewis' face. "Why? That wouldn't be fair!" he argued.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a long sword from his space ring. Its blade glinted beautifully under the lights. It was a low-grade sacred weapon. It was not obtained from the Genuine Dragon World, but was from the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>On the Sea God Continent, sacred weapons weren't a rarity. All of the talents of the various races within the Tower of Sin had sacred weapons, but they were all low-grade. A small number of warriors were able to obtain mid-grade sacred weapons, but top-grade sacred weapons were extremely rare.</p>

  <p>However, in the Central Region, even low-grade sacred weapons were considered to be of high value, as there weren't many sacred weapons there to begin with. The few low-grade sacred weapons scattered in the region were seen like holy relics. They were practically the most precious treasures of the sects. Warriors even believed that the sacred weapons would bring great fortune to them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Zheng took out this low-grade sacred weapon, Tianming's and Lewis' eyes widened. Even the normally calm and composed Patrick was not able to hide his shock.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you aren't planning to give this sword to Tianming, are you? That would be too wasteful!" Lewis said quickly and thoughtlessly.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Tianming barked at him as faint sword shadows congealed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Lewis' figure disappeared from his original position, and he jumped behind Patrick. "I was telling the truth. A sacred weapon would be wasted on you! Why not give it to me instead, Zheng?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, is this one of the gifts you were talking about?" Patrick asked with a cautious look on his face. He wondered how Zheng could have gotten hold of such a precious item.</p>

  <p>"This sword is for Tianming. It's only fitting for a good swordsman to wield a good sword," Zheng explained. He was a swordsman himself, and so he understood the value of a good sword.</p>

  <p>Tianming closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His eyes opened again and he looked at the long sword with his eyes burning with fervor and admiration. But then, he shook his head and tore his eyes away from the blade. "I can't accept this, Zheng. A sacred weapon is too precious," he said in a controlled voice, as if his own refusal pained him.</p>

  <p>Even Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance only had one or two sacred weapons in their possession, and yet Zheng was presenting him with one. His heart beat loudly in his chest as he marveled at the sword, but he couldn't accept the gift. It was too valuable.</p>

  <p>Seeing the conflicted look in Tianming's eyes, Zheng smiled and said, "Don't turn me down. Sacred weapons are priceless in your eyes, but I don't think so. I want you to have this, Tianming."</p>

  <p>"You don't think so?" Lewis gaped at Zheng, his jaw flung open so widely that it could fall to ground any time. "Zheng, where have you been these past two years?"</p>

  <p>Patrick also stared at Zheng, speechless.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a pair of short swords next. There were four short swords in total— twin swords were sheathed within two mother swords.</p>

  <p>"This pair of short swords is also a low-grade sacred weapon." Zheng glanced at Lewis after he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>"It can't be...for me?" Lewis asked disbelievingly. His entire body began to tremble as he looked at the swords in Zheng's hands.</p>
