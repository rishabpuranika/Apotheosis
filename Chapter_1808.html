<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1808 The Invaders (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The events of the first two months were more than enough to make him realize he had to do something promptly. Originally, he had anticipated the final month to be peaceful, but now, in the midst of all these events, it was destined to be fully chaotic. The universe had no chance of being peaceful.</p>

  <p>A very startling thing happened in the third month. The unbreakable Sighing Wall was broken!</p>

  <p>When three hundred ace talents competed on the Heaven Earth Board, the first ace talent to be eliminated was a warrior from the Spring race.</p>

  <p>For a weak race like the Spring race to produce an ace talent was already an inconceivable thing. After all, there were very few members of the Spring race, and they only occupied three poor supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, a Supreme Lord predicted that this great danger would erupt within the Spring race.</p>

  <p>In the end, it proved that the Supreme Lord's deduction was correct.</p>

  <p>When the Sighing Wall was broken through, the invaders like locusts quickly occupied the territory of the Spring race. In no time, the entire clan was completely annihilated.</p>

  <p>This news exploded in everyone's ears like thunder, shocking the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that the apocalypse would come soon, but not even in their wildest dreams would they think it would happen this soon. The violent manner in which it happened shook everyone to the core.</p>

  <p>However, a strange thing happened which further startled everyone. The invaders occupied only the territories of three supreme worlds and didn't continue to advance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others were also paying close attention to this matter. Since the invaders behind the Sighing Wall had arrived in a blink of an eye, they wondered if there was still a need for them to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, most of the Supreme Lords had gathered in the Celestial Position once again.</p>

  <p>After occupying three supreme worlds, the invaders hadn't yet made any effort to advance into the universe. Instead, they chose a group of representatives to come forth in a grandiose manner. Another unexpected thing happened. It turned out they were actually going to carry out a negotiation with them!</p>

  <p>Such a piece of news, undoubtedly, began to spread like a wildfire.</p>

  <p>When this startling news reached Luo Zheng and the others, they also felt a bit suspicious.</p>

  <p>Since these invaders had the power to break through the Sighing Wall and enter the universe, they couldn't understand why they had asked for a negotiation.</p>

  <p>What was even more unexpected was that Master Feng actually accepted the negotiation, and the location of the negotiation was decided to be at the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>The participants of this negotiation weren't limited to the Supreme Lords, but Luo Zheng and the others were also invited.</p>

  <p>All the powers in the universe expectantly waited for this negotiation.</p>

  <p>After all, this was related to the fate of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>If the invaders could be convinced to give up their plans to invade the universe, then that would be the best achievement. However, such a result was unlikely.</p>

  <p>There was a treasured mountain named Breaking Cloud Mountain in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place. All year round, it was covered in profound ice. As a result, the entire body was sparkling and translucent. The beautiful scenery was a sight to behold. Its beauty was so unearthly that at certain times it seemed like an illusion.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Zheng, Tianming and the rest had arrived at the summit of Breaking Cloud Mountain. In front of them, over fifty Supreme Lords were gathered.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a few dazzling lights appeared in the sky. At the same time, an extremely powerful Mu Ning exploded forth, as though a certain devil lord had descended into this world, causing people to feel incomparable reverence for him.</p>

  <p>In front of a Supreme Lord, releasing that Mu Ning was just a small trick.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin waved his hand simply and that Mu Ning disappeared like a wisp of smoke.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha... With so many Supreme Lords welcoming me, I, Maha, am truly honored!"</p>

  <p>Following that, a burst of extremely arrogant laughter resounded in the sky. Amongst them, there was a figure that rushed down first. This person was a violet-haired youth. However, this youth was not a Supreme Lord. He was only a world lord!</p>

  <p>If an ordinary world lord acted so arrogantly in front of Supreme Lords, he would inevitably suffer a loss.</p>

  <p>Amongst the many Supreme Lords on Breaking Cloud Mountain, there were a few ill-tempered Supreme Lords. They frowned and had an urge to teach him a lesson, but they were stopped by Master Feng.</p>

  <p>Behind Maha were nine other powerhouses. They were the Supreme Lords of another universe.</p>

  <p>"They are from…. the Sacred race?" Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he whispered.</p>

  <p>Lucille asked curiously, "What Sacred race?"</p>

  <p>"A powerful race," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had stepped into the True Path in his fairy palace, the opponents whom he had encountered during the assessment were all warriors from the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>According to Saul, the Sacred race was the most perfect race, while the Demon Night race, the human race, the ogre race paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>This was because all the humanoid races seemed to be descended from the Sacred race. Hence the Sacred race had the advantage over many different races!</p>

  <p>As Maha spoke, he shot downwards at an extremely high speed. The instant his feet hit the ground, a massive crack suddenly burst out from the center of this crystal clear Breaking Cloud Mountain.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's face darkened. With a slight push from his feet, the crack once again closed. It seemed like the crack didn't appear all this time.</p>

  <p>The negotiation was yet to begin but the two sides seemed to be at loggerheads already. Each one of those present had their own ideas and was wondering what the result would be.</p>
