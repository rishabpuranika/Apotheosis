  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mystery of the Transcendent Divine Might was truly far beyond what Luo Luo Zheng could have ever imagined.</p>

  <p>Scattered across the vast sky were countless twinkling stars that seemed to wink at him, and mischievous lights that were probably no less than trillions of miles away from his grasp. Even if Luo Luo Zheng determinedly journeyed for millions of years, the odds of reaching the nearest star he could see in the distance would still be low.</p>

  <p>However hopeless his goal of reaching the glimmering stars might have been, the general guide of the Transcendent Divine Might enabled him to regain his optimism. This was due to the unbelievable fact that there was now a way to communicate with those far-off stars and trigger their formidable powers.</p>

  <p>Just by that detail alone, Luo Luo Zheng could tell that it was almost inconceivable to even think of.</p>

  <p>According to the records that came with the general guide, it firmly stated the more stars one could connect with in a moment, the more star power an individual could ultimately draw and initiate. Furthermore, the power mobilized for the Stellar Body could also become much stronger.</p>

  <p>Among the mysteries of the Transcendent Divine Might was the secret method located in the general guide for the Stellar Body, which was able to utilize the abilities of the soul to comprehend such distant stars. Although he had found the long awaited secret, Luo Luo Zheng still found it abnormally mysterious and surreptitious to believe.</p>

  <p>There were many aspects of the world that humans had a definite knowledge of, like having a sense of everything that existed and that included objects as large as the Tower of Sin standing proudly in front of Luo Luo Zheng and things as tiny as insects fluttering about in the stale wind.</p>

  <p>Moreover, people grasped the realities of the things they could see closely in their everyday lives such as towering trees and moving people, as well as things like the glimmering lights of the stars in the vast atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Although it was true that humans could see innumerable celestial bodies, their perception of the stars was insubstantial at best. Except for being able to observe their faint radiance, no one could simply obtain any significant information regarding a particular star. Questions such as how their powers could be used and how to properly activate them had existed persistently generation after generation with not so much of an accurate theory withstanding the test of time.</p>

  <p>Confusion and doubt regarding the stars had never solved their ongoing problem.</p>

  <p>Under the continuous experimentation of the revealed secret method, it did not take a significantly long time before Luo Zheng's sensibility began to slowly strengthen and lengthen.</p>

  <p>It was a common fact that the strength of one's sensibility was greatly determined by their soul. As Luo Zheng's soul was extremely powerful and its capabilities were exceptional, his sensibility therefore exceeded that of an ordinary living creature.</p>

  <p>Little by little, Luo Zheng's sensibility reached one hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Next, his sensibility stretched to two hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Not long after, it spanned to over five hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Astonishingly, Luo Luo Zheng reached the thousand's mark and kept on going.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching ten thousand feet, Luo Zheng's sensibility had achieved its limit. If he were to extend his sensibility any further than the distance it had just stretched to, it would completely break and all of his senses would become blurry.</p>

  <p>Sighing while opening his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng muttered, "My sensibility reached its limit. How can I perceive the distant stars? Is it not the same as trying to hit the moon with a bamboo stick?" The man asked with a slight pout on his face as his tone reflected his dejection.</p>

  <p>The red dragon shortly snickered at the sulking Luo Luo Zheng before speaking. "Hit the moon with a bamboo stick? You are indeed doing exactly that right now.</p>

  <p>If they follow this method dutifully, even creatures ten thousand times stronger than you would not be able to sense such a distant starry sky, let alone you!" the dragon chastised the man, who was listening intently. "Now close your eyes!"</p>

  <p>The man obediently closed his eyes at the dragon's command, due to his reasoning that the dragon did know best about the method and how he was supposed to connect with it and make it work.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng tried his best to focus once more with his eyes closed, the red dragon spoke again, "According to the secret method of the Stellar Body general guide, you can roam the great world and even turn yourself to an immortal being just by a mere thought." As the dragon finished, silence blanketed them as Luo Luo Zheng began to ponder deeply about the implications behind his words.</p>

  <p>'The secret method of turning into an immortal by just thinking it...' the man brooded over the thought, furrowing his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Heavily contemplating on what the dragon declared, Luo Zheng's heart started to beat faster as he suddenly saw the light. For a moment, it seemed like Luo Luo Zheng fully understood what he was supposed to do. The young man's breath started to stutter as he began to summon his perception according to the secret method he had been ordered to do.</p>

  <p>At this instant, Luo Luo Zheng willed his perception to slowly open up once more.</p>

  <p>However, the upper part of his perception refused to cooperate and was instead constantly shrinking and condensing.</p>

  <p>With a sudden jolt, Luo Luo Zheng unexpectedly sensed that everything that surrounded him had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Apart from not being able to sense the faint breeze that occasionally passed by and the muffled sounds of white noise from where he was, he found that he could not even feel his own body anymore. For some reason, his consciousness seemed to detach from his material form and completely merge with his perception.</p>

  <p>Not long after the strange happening, an even stranger occurrence happened to him as he felt a forceful gravity from the sky drawing him in, ceaselessly pulling on his consciousness. At this rate, Luo Zheng's consciousness was rising at an incredible speed, steadily moving farther and farther away from the Sea God Continent!</p>

  <p>With the energy from his mind, he turned over and looked down at where his initial position had been. Overlooking the landscape with wonder, the Tower of Sin appeared to be smaller as he ascended, making the massive building look like a short unlit match and the places around it looking smaller than his outstretched fingers.</p>

  <p>Within short minutes, the Tower of Sin disappeared altogether, leaving nothing but a faint outline. Looking down for a second time, Luo Zheng's newfound astonishment was caused by the entire Sea God Continent appearing right before his very eyes, gleaming with its abundant natural resources.</p>

  <p>The man did not have to wait long before even the Sea God Continent appeared smaller and smaller. The young man currently fascinated by the scenery compared the sight to a boat seamlessly floating above the endless ocean.</p>

  <p>"So huge..." Luo Luo Zheng mumbled, awestruck at what his formless consciousness had brought him to witness.</p>

  <p>Reflecting by himself with nostalgia running deep within his bones, he realized with a start that the great world was much larger and more magnificent than what he could have ever imagined. Nothing could have defeated this kind of experience as he was suddenly blessed with seeing the great world in all its glory.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's consciousness continued to lengthen and reach even farther, he estimated that about seven or eight continents materialized above the limitless body of water which made him see more of what they had occupied as he rose higher. Reaching an impressive height, he distinguished the continents from one another which were separated from each other by a great distance.</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes from his spirit form, his gaze locked on one specific continent and promptly gasped. "That is... Central Region!"</p>

  <p>The man was clearly surprised and startled by the sight as his heart rate picked up erratically. Among these seven or eight continents, the Central Region was probably the smallest continent in terms of area. The Chaotic Ocean of Stars was right beside the Central Region, and the four divine kingdoms were just right by the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. With another jolt, he quickly came upon the realization that the four divine kingdoms' total territory was over ten times bigger than the Central Region!</p>
