  <p>
</p>

  <p>The human spirits had calmed down after hearing the words directly from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Plotting revenge against the Snake Spirit Sect was like digging their own graves. It was a useless and self-destructive plan.</p>

  <p>"We understand. But what else can we do?" one of the human spirits chimed in.</p>

  <p>This human spirit's name was Powell. He was regarded as the leader of this group of world builders. Campbell and all the other human spirits were completely obedient and loyal to him.</p>

  <p>"Your understanding of the chaos is deeper than ours. We need your help if we ought to find out where the Human Spirit King is," Luo Zheng humbly replied.</p>

  <p>"And why should we believe in you human beings? How can we trust you?" Powell stared at Luo Zheng. There was a look of utter skepticism in his face.</p>

  <p>These world builders created the human beings. It was because of them that Luo Zheng and the others existed.</p>

  <p>Powell considered human beings like Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven as mere carvings of the human spirits. Therefore, how could the human beings of the secondary world be the ones to lead the human spirits of the main world? This was quite unthinkable to them.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Campbell and the others had the exact same thoughts.</p>

  <p>They couldn't quite accept that notion.</p>

  <p>Because they were their creators, it was normal for the human spirits to think that they were superior to human beings.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Zheng didn't care about Powell's doubts and concerns. He just smiled gently and said, "Because the Monkey Spirit King trusts me."</p>

  <p>With that, Powell and the other human spirits fell silent. They could not argue with that.</p>

  <p>In actuality, the world builders didn't have a good position in the Four Spirits Sect. They weren't even permitted to enter the Ten Directions House.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King chose to put his trust on Luo Zheng. This proved to be the biggest support in Luo Zheng's favor. After that conversation, the world builders had temporarily settled down on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, Judson had tirelessly remolded the Li Shan mountain. He worked on it day and night.</p>

  <p>He had already dug out about one-third of the west side of the entire Li Shan mountain. The stones he unearthed had been turned into metals using the force of truth. In turn, these metals were placed in a certain pattern. They formed an enormous circular structure that was thousands of miles in length.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Kendrick had set up an array upon the huge structure.</p>

  <p>"The array has already been set up. It can be activated at any point in time," Kendrick said to Luo Zheng impassively.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and took out the mother butterfly given to him by the real Snake Goddess. Slowly, he began to sense the location of the young butterflies.</p>

  <p>One of these young butterflies was attached to the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he would be able to feel the primitive land's location using the mother butterfly. According to the real Snake Goddess, this would work no matter how far away he was.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and infused his consciousness into the mother butterfly. Afterwards, he felt a faint existence deep in his heart. Following where it led, he found the location of that specific butterfly.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and said, "Northwest!</p>

  <p>Towards that direction!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately pointed at the distance.</p>

  <p>"Change the direction," Kendrick conveyed to Judson emotionlessly.</p>

  <p>There was a deep rumbling sound as Judson began the adjustment of the structure.</p>

  <p>The enormous circular structure leaned against the side of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Judson had made a huge turntable. Under his careful manipulation, the turntable adjusted the direction of the huge structure.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Go!" Judson motioned to them.</p>

  <p>Seeing his signal, Kendrick and Gerald released the truth power simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Aside from the two Chaos Ancient Gods, the Eternal Realm warriors and the Holy Soul Realm warriors also had contributions. Each one of them released their blood power.</p>

  <p>In a short amount of time, massive amounts of energy began to accumulate in the west of the Li Shan mountain. This energy was channeled into a tall tower. And at its top, sat a young girl named Yan.</p>

  <p>She had already started to utilize the function of the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>As soon as the violent and gentle energy accumulated inside the Energy Shaft, she immediately transformed it.</p>

  <p>All the energy absorbed by the Energy Shaft poured intensely into the array upon the enormous rounded structure.</p>

  <p>As the massive amount of energy flowed into the array, it emitted a loud buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the entire array began to flash. A bright and blinding light shot out of it.</p>

  <p>It exerted a mighty push onto the enormous circular structure.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, the force was evenly distributed to the entire Li Shan mountain to help speed up its movement.</p>

  <p>Whoosh... Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Gradually, the Li Shan mountain began to change its direction.</p>

  <p>This colossal structure left a long trace in the empty chaos. After adjusting its course, it began to move at such an extraordinary speed towards the northwest of the chaos.</p>

  <p>As the Li Shan mountain set off its new course, Luo Zheng sighed. "It's a pity we didn't meet the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. If we just go directly through its space cave, I'm sure we can save a lot of time..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once traveled through the space cave created by the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. During that time, he was headed to the Source World from the divine land. The space cave was a shortcut to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Kendrick was standing next to Luo Zheng the whole time. When he heard this, he laughed softly. "It's quite impossible for the Li Shan mountain to pass through the space cave made by the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. If Othniel was still alive, we could have gone through the space cave he made."</p>

  <p>The Sky Rending Rhinoceros was one of the top ten beasts of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Its strength was merely comparable to that of an Eternal Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Chaos Ancient Gods didn't take it seriously.</p>

  <p>"Stop worrying. With the help of the array and Yan's Energy Shaft, the Li Shan mountain can move at an extremely high speed. Let's just wait and see..."</p>

  <p>Judson chimed in as he heard them talking. He had absolute confidence in their abilities.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and agreed. "With the help of three Chaos Ancient Gods, the human race is truly lucky."</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain's speed was steadily accelerating.</p>

  <p>Right now, there was an immense distance between the Source World and the Li Shan mountain. The Source World actually looked like a full moon up in the sky.</p>

  <p>The hundreds of millions of human beings and the members of the Snake Goddess race on the Li Shan mountain had been extremely terrified in the past few days. Never in their lives did they imagine that the Li Shan mountain would leave the Source World and carry them to an unknown place. They had no idea of what kind of fate awaited them in the days to come.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's inner world was still evolving at breakneck speed. All he could do was to watch as it developed.</p>

  <p>Every time a monstrous tsunami occurred, a large patch of land would emerge from the sea.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the land only appeared gradually and occupied a very small part of the sea. Not long after, more volcanoes at the bottom of the sea began to erupt. This terrifying and catastrophic force would cause a monstrous tsunami.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, more patches of land sprang up like mushrooms after rain.</p>

  <p>These lands began to merge with each other and formed large continents.</p>

  <p>After a while, different kinds of plants began to appear. One moment, it was still a bare continent. The next, it had turned into a lush grassland.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate was so fast that it made people feel suffocated.</p>

  <p>The inner world's development trend in the past revealed that all sorts of creatures would appear after the plants. These creatures would slowly obtain intelligence and establish tribes. Afterwards, these tribes would turn into cities. These cities would transform into great forces, empires, and even civilizations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not allowed to interfere with the development of the primitive land. Therefore, he could only watch in silence as it evolved.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the situation did not develop as Luo Zheng imagined. There were so many things that didn't go according to his plan.</p>

  <p>Some kind of bamboo shoot-shaped plants grew on these continents. After these plants were born, they began to devour other plants frenziedly. They started growing ceaselessly.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the other plants on the continents merely became food for the bamboo shoot-shaped plants.</p>

  <p>After a short amount of time, all of the plants on the continents were devoured by these predatory plants. These plants also quickly grew from dozens of feet to thousands of miles in height and extended all the way to the edge of the primitive land!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen some gigantic plants in the Source World. Some intelligent plants were even able to reach the Other Shore Realm. However, none of them could compare to these bamboo shoot-shaped plants.</p>

  <p>As these insatiable plants became thousands of miles tall and hundreds of miles in diameter, they intersected and gathered at the edge of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he observed them for a while. His pupils narrowed slightly, and one word popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>"Teeth?" This was what he imagined they were.</p>

  <p>If he imagined the primitive land as the head of a giant beast, then these bamboo shoot-shaped plants were the teeth of this beast.</p>
