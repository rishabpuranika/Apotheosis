  <p>
</p>

  <p>Separating an entire province from the Source World was a fairly easy task for a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Three enchanted barriers had covered the top of the Li Shan mountain. Now, Kendrick needed to draw the barriers into the underground.</p>

  <p>Around three minutes later, an enormous and deep circular trench appeared in an area outside the Source world!</p>

  <p>If they viewed the Source World as a large rounded fruit, the area where the Li Shan mountain stood had now been cleanly sliced off by the Dragon Scale Defense.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain could be separated from the rest of the Source World with just a little push from the inside.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, dozens of Evil Gods were still fighting against Luo Zheng above the Li Shan mountain. It seemed as though they were deliberately fighting him at such a leisurely pace.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had been thoroughly enjoying this way of fighting. He could probably do this the entire day without getting tired.</p>

  <p>He practically had an infinite amount of power. The power was like a noose that was gradually tightening around Luo Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>This was the only way he could force Luo Zheng into exhausting every bit of his power. Then, he would make Luo Zheng surrender miserably to him!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! dozens of Evil Gods charged wildly towards Luo Zheng like a pack of hungry wolves. Each of them was carrying Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng stood his ground and remained oddly calm.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of the plan. Kendrick was trying to detach the Li Shan mountain from the rest of the Source World.</p>

  <p>This meant that the longer he could hold off the Evil God, the more advantageous it would be for the Li Shan mountain. A long delay was what they needed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! He swiftly drew the blood sword and held it tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>The blood sword slashed rapidly in every direction.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the blood sword underwent an esoteric transformation. It released several blood lines that pierced through the Evil Gods. After that, they formed an intricate yet chaotic pattern all throughout their bodies.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng made a pulling motion, the sharp patterns quickly streaked past the Evil Gods and chopped them to pieces.</p>

  <p>The scene looked absolutely gruesome as blood gushed out and splashed everywhere.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was trembling. Her heart ached terribly as she watched this grisly scene unfold.</p>

  <p>As the head of the Li Shan mountain, the Snake Goddess obviously had the inherent disposition of a true leader. She had always been courageous and resolute.</p>

  <p>She knew that there would always be sacrifices in any battle. However, it was extremely painful for her to watch as their members ended up as the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>The Evil God possessed the bodies of the people nearby. The Evil Gods battling with Luo Zheng were actually the elites of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>They had no knowledge of what happened and what they were doing. It meant that Luo Zheng had to kill them not because of their own actions, but of the Evil God's. The Snake Goddess couldn't express her pain and regret in mere words.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, they heard someone shout. "I have done it! I have finished cutting the Li Shan mountain!"</p>

  <p>It was Kendrick's voice that everyone heard in the midst of the battle.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the two Chaos Ancient Gods slightly froze in surprise. It was done!</p>

  <p>Now that the first step had been completed, the next step would be to push the Li Shan mountain out!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Kendrick's voice, his expression did not change even the slightest. He remained focused on the Evil Gods' attacks.</p>

  <p>"Incredible! Well, let's see if you can block my next attack. How about a hundred people?" the Evil God exclaimed with such excitement and anticipation.</p>

  <p>All at once, over one hundred Evil Gods charged towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were a hundred and one Evil Gods rapidly converging on him!</p>

  <p>One of them swooped directly in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng instinctively drew his blood sword and stabbed the Evil God straight in the chest. "This method of attack is futile," he remarked coldly.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God smiled at Luo Zheng derisively before he could cut him into pieces. "I want you to know that it's useless to move the Li Shan mountain out of the Source World."</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Luo Zheng looked at him darkly. He gently pulled the blood sword in his hand and instantly dismembered that Evil God. Afterwards, he bellowed, "Everyone! Move!" As soon as they heard him, they immediately took action.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>They heard loud booming sounds that came from inside the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors moved away from the jadeite platform. Subsequently, they each appeared at the top, on the mountainside, and some other places of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Each of these places had a dome-shaped enchanted barrier. These were the areas that had been marked by Kendrick beforehand. They were supposed to apply force in these designated points.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warriors considered the Li Shan mountain fragile. But by targeting these areas, their powers would be evenly distributed. It would help them hit the huge mountain simultaneously.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Eternal Realm warriors appeared on the dome-shaped barriers, they slammed those specific areas with their full strength all at once.</p>

  <p>In fact, a Chaos Ancient God would be able to push the Li Shan mountain out of the Source World. It could even be accomplished by him alone if there was enough time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they still had an unpredictable and all-powerful Evil God to deal with. Therefore, the only way they could execute their plan was to do it without warning.</p>

  <p>Kendrick had already cut the edge of the Li Shan mountain using the Dragon Scale Defense. When the combined powers of the Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods erupted, there wasn't a single crack on the surface of the Li Shan mountain. The cut was completely smooth!</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish! All of a sudden, they heard a strong rushing sound.</p>

  <p>Boundless chaotic energy surged from the cut at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the three enchanted barriers Kendrick had set up earlier covered the entire Li Shan mountain. These enchanted barriers could completely block flow of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>However, they noticed a huge problem. The Li Shan mountain was slowly sinking!</p>

  <p>"What just happened?" Fuxi yelled amidst the commotion.</p>

  <p>"The Li Shan mountain collapsed!" It was Ying who answered.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it! How could such a huge mountain collapse?" King Ieuan mumbled in disbelief.</p>

  <p>There were several large cities of the human race and the Snake Goddess race located in the Li Shan mountain. These cities were built on the flat mountainside. All of a sudden, the people residing there felt that the entire mountainside was sinking. This phenomenon was way beyond their understanding.</p>

  <p>At this point, there were more than ten thousand Evil Gods hovering in the sky. They watched as the Li Shan mountain began sinking gradually. The mockery in their eyes became even more evident.</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God spoke tauntingly, "You don't even stand a chance against me. What makes you think you can take on the Source World?"</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God finished talking, something unusual happened. All of a sudden, the space crystal wall around the Li Shan mountain changed color.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain's entire inner space was completely sealed!</p>

  <p>This kind of space sealing was extremely strong and sturdy. It was even quite impossible for Othniel to break free from it.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain had already sunk hundreds of feet. But now, its descent was stopped.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, they heard someone shout. "Truth gives me greater strength!" Gerald roared at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>When they heard this, Judson and Kendrick also began to extract their truth bloodline fervently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi's hair was fluttering wildly as the Eight Diagrams beneath his feet were rotating at an extraordinary speed.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Ying, King Ieuan, and the Snake Goddess began to exert more strength as well.</p>

  <p>Crack! They heard a loud splitting noise.</p>

  <p>Crack! It was getting even louder!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The ripping sound that came from around the Li Shan mountain was deafening. It was as if two invisible and out-of-place cogwheels were grinding against each other.</p>

  <p>Little by little, the Li Shan mountain began to sink once more.</p>

  <p>"Your united strength is very commendable. However, you have to remember who you are fighting against." Over ten thousand Evil Gods smiled gracefully at the same time.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, everything that happened this day was according to the Evil God's plan. He even deliberately left the space unlocked just for fun. Otherwise, it would have been extremely difficult for the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and other Eternal Realm warriors to scatter at the Li Shan mountain's specific places.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Without warning, numerous blue space chains shot out from every Evil God's body. These space chains were like hidden weapons. They had easily pierced through Kendrick's enchanted barriers and were now drilling into the interior of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>These space chains were highly effective in penetrating and containing the entire mountain. They didn't need to pierce through any of the pressure bearing points.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the Evil Gods pulled the space chains and ascended into the sky.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Evil God had a much simpler plan to prevent the escape of the Li Shan mountain. He had already thought of just killing the Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods. However, he thought that it seemed more interesting to deal with the Li Shan mountain using the space chains.</p>

  <p>More than ten thousand Evil Gods were previously Holy Soul Realm masters. Therefore, the power that erupted simultaneously was utterly phenomenal!</p>

  <p>Together with the power of the space sealing in the Source World, the Li Shan mountain immediately stopped sinking!</p>

  <p>In addition to that, it also began to rise gradually!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The sound of enormous cogwheels clashing resounded through the whole place once more. Each time they heard a loud cracking sound, the Li Shan mountain rose by ten feet!</p>

  <p>In just a short span of time, the entire Li Shan mountain was lifted from the ground!</p>

  <p>It was quite unbelievable to watch as the enormous mountain floated in the air. This phenomenon was probably the first one to occur in the Source World!</p>

  <p>"If you like flying, then fly even higher!" The Evil God laughed wildly.</p>

  <p>Everything was going right according to his plan.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>More Evil Gods began to appear at the top of the mountain. Each of them was holding on to a space chain.</p>

  <p>And then, ten thousand more Evil Gods appeared.</p>

  <p>Now, there were more than twenty thousand of them...</p>

  <p>Then thirty thousand...</p>

  <p>As the number of the Evil Gods increased, the Li Shan mountain was also being raised even higher!</p>
