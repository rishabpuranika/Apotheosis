  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and the Snake Goddess pulled Fuxi back to the area covered by the Imprisoning Lightning, Fuxi lay flat on the ground, catching his breath.</p>

  <p>Lightning had burnt the muscles on his arms into gray powder. Surprisingly, he didn't feel any pain at all.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate enough that only half of his arms stretched out from the Imprisoning Lightning. If he was pulled out a little more, his head would have also been struck by thunderbolts, and he would instantly be killed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess held out her hand, revealing a branch in her palm.</p>

  <p>The energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess had been insinuated into the branch. The branch then sprouted to life, showing two beautiful emerald leaves.</p>

  <p>She picked the leaves and gently wrapped them around Fuxi's arms. Fuxi's charred arms began to recover, bright red flesh, healthy muscles and new skin growing there. In less than a minute, the wounds had been completely healed.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess cured Fuxi, she saw Luo Zheng staring blankly at the distance. She asked curiously, "What's wrong? Do you know those long-haired monsters?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was experienced and knowledgeable, but she had never seen such strange creatures before.</p>

  <p>They could block the thunderbolts and lightning only using their long hair and were also capable of opening a door at will. Was this a new force that appeared in the Three Purities Stage?</p>

  <p>"I don't know those long-haired monsters." Luo Zheng shook his head. "But I know that door..." he continued.</p>

  <p>"The door... seems to be made of the space rule. Have you ever seen it before?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Do you know the little girl beside Madam Ying?" he uttered again.</p>

  <p>"You mean Ling Shuang, right?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Although Ling Shuang was only a disciple of the Origin Mountain, she was the apple of Ying's eye. Since the Snake Goddess was gifted with a retentive memory, she couldn't forget Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded. "After Madam Ying was trapped, Ling Shuang disappeared, and everyone in the Taiyi Heaven Palace couldn't find her.</p>

  <p>Later, the Taiyi Heaven Palace moved to the Li Shan mountain, but she still hasn't shown up."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess frowned, her eyebrows wrinkling slightly. She wondered why Luo Zheng mentioned Ling Shuang, and what she had to do with the long-haired monsters.</p>

  <p>"When I entered Stage One of the Other Shore along with Ling Shuang, I used the Great Dominance Technique once. Upon taking control of her, I saw a door in her mind which was almost the same as that door." Luo Zheng pointed at place where the door had just disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were surprised by what they heard.</p>

  <p>Others only knew that Ling Shuang had some unique talents. She had a high status in the Taiyi Heaven Palace with the favor and care of Ying who was of the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that Ling Shuang kept more secrets than the others had known.</p>

  <p>That door had always been closed...</p>

  <p>After her disappearance, it could be opened freely. There must be some connection between the two...</p>

  <p>Could it be that Ling Shuang had opened this door?</p>

  <p>If the situation had not been too tense earlier, Luo Zheng would have tried to communicate with the two long-haired monsters. But now, he couldn't search for them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng started walking over with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. He reached out his hand and touched the air, trying to locate the remaining power of space.</p>

  <p>However, under the attack of the thunderbolts, it had already dissipated.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the ancestry-level bloodline had a way to find the door, but the ancestry-level bloodline always hesitated even if Luo Zheng asked for its help during a critical moment. It was simply unrealistic to expect voluntary help from it.</p>

  <p>"Are you thinking that she probably entered the door?" the Snake Goddess asked, almost seeing through Luo Zheng's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement. "She is not even at the Holy Soul Realm. There is no reason for her to escape from the Taiyi Heaven Palace..."</p>

  <p>"There are still many unrevealed secrets of the Other Shore, and it isn't too strange that we couldn't find her here. However, since this door has appeared, some secrets shall be discovered sooner or later," the Snake Goddess comforted Luo Zheng in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Fuxi squinted at Luo Zheng when he listened to the conversation at the moment.</p>

  <p>He then continued to concentrate on collecting the Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>As they passed through the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain, the Augury Dog displayed a state of calm and tranquility. They kept moving north, safely passing through the entirety of the plain.</p>

  <p>"If all of the Solid Lightning Powder is activated, its resulting power will be unimaginable!" Fuxi exclaimed as he stored the Solid Lightning Powder in his space ring. He was pleased to gain an unexpected harvest. Such an amount of Solid Lightning Powder could be used as a trump card.</p>

  <p>A red forest stood in front of them as they went farther from the Heavenly Thunder Plain. The Flaming Maple Trees a thousand feet high towered over them, densely lighting up the whole area. The scenery was magnificent and magically colorful.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful... What kind of death land is this?" Luo Zheng asked, expressing his confusion.</p>

  <p>The more beautiful and peculiar a place appeared, the more dangerous it was. Luo Zheng concluded this after all that he had gone through.</p>

  <p>This time, his guess was proved wrong. The Snake Goddess smiled and said, "The Flaming Maple Forest is considered a safe area within the Three Purities Stage. No one will attack us here."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out her finger and pointed at a distant space in the Flaming Maple Forest. A beam of energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess spiraled out from her finger and drilled into the ground.</p>

  <p>As the energy beam drilled deeper, all the Flaming Maple Trees began to shake, and a heavy gust of energy rose from the forest.</p>

  <p>The strong wave of energy made everyone gasp for air. On the contrary, the Augury Dog was strangely quiet. He was aware that the Snake Goddess' test was safe, and this pressure was naturally a warning from the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Even though the Snake Goddess' move was purely a test, a maple leaf started shooting towards her, hitting her body.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't bother to dodge because she knew she could not.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, she touched the blood oozing from her chest. Beneath her hand, the wound started to heal. She turned to Luo Zheng and asked calmly, "Now, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"They attack whoever fights here. Is that right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," The Snake Goddess nodded. "Thus, it is also considered a shelter within the Three Purities Stage. Many Eternal Realm warriors enter the Flaming Maple Forest to seek protection after an adventure in the Grand Pure Realm. The Three Purities Stage has more than one shelter."</p>

  <p>"This is another reason why the latecomers were able to contend against the Element Spirit Civilization in the Three Purities Stage," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race into the Three Purities Stage, he had also taken refuge in these shelters. The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were now trapped in a similar shelter.</p>

  <p>"Don't release any energy in the shelter, or you will suffer a great loss."</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess' warning, the three of them continued to explore the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>According to the Snake Goddess, many creatures were hidden in the vast forest.</p>

  <p>Some of them were Eternal Realm warriors from the Grand Plain Stage, while some were from the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>These creatures carefully maintained a distance from each other. When they saw the three of them arrive, the creatures quietly left, hiding in the depths of the forest.</p>

  <p>For everyone, passing through a safe place was a piece of cake. Luo Zheng was also relaxed, but the ancestry-level bloodline in his body did not seem to intend for him to relax.</p>
