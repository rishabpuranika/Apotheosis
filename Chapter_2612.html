<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2612 The Guidance Of The Broken Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To be honest, Nicholas really treasured Lowell's extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>So when he had heard that Lowell joined the Dongfang Clan for Iris, he rewarded them the Cyan Yellow Double Swords, with the obvious intention of drawing Lowell over to his side.</p>

  <p>After he had rewarded them the two swords, he also continued to reward other outstanding disciples.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming tucked the sword into his space ring and stood quietly in a corner. Then, his eyes scanned Nicholas.</p>

  <p>This was Tianming's first time to see his target.</p>

  <p>If he were to be asked about first impressions, then he honestly found it hard to dislike this middle-aged man with a fair-skinned face.</p>

  <p>Yet, he was fated to be this man's enemy. It could never be changed no matter what happened.</p>

  <p>It was because of that very reason Mike had created him…</p>

  <p>And so, his first step in going undercover in the Dongfang Clan was to take advantage of Iris.</p>

  <p>In any case, he could gather more resources in this place and more importantly, he could gain the trust of the Dongfang Clan, or even Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Once Nicholas had given the rewards, he left with the Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Chatter between the young talents quickly filled the Cyan Shadow Hall after the elders left.</p>

  <p>These young True Gods usually fought in the Arena of Legends, went into closed door cultivation, or traveled through the forbidden lands all day long. They rarely had the chance to get together.</p>

  <p>It was true that they were all outstanding, but they were also very arrogant. They all tended to compare with each other when they were together.</p>

  <p>Currently, all of them cast hostile looks on Tianming and Iris.</p>

  <p>After all, they were in the Dongfang Clan. How could they possibly allow an outsider to get the best reward?</p>

  <p>At that moment, something clicked in Tianming's mind. "Let's go," he said to Iris with a smile.</p>

  <p>Iris simply nodded and got ready to leave with him.</p>

  <p>It was also her first time to enter the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan. Truth be told, she felt out of place. If it wasn't for Lowell, then she might have never gone to the place in her whole life, even if she was eligible to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard a highly sarcastic voice that said, "I didn't expect that a sub-branch of our clan could decline to this extent! They failed to find any young talents among themselves so they had to sell a woman to befriend an outsider! It's so humiliating for our Dongfang Clan! Such a shame!"</p>

  <p>A frown tugged Iris' lips down.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Dongfang Clan had many branches, and the competition among them was quite tough.</p>

  <p>Although Iris's branch was just a sub-branch, they still had a Demi-holy Being who guarded them. They did not fail as that person said.</p>

  <p>That person was clearly trying to offend them on purpose.</p>

  <p>She also knew that the person's words weren't for her, but for Lowell.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't want him to get involved in a fight just for her sake.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" she said and took Tianming's hand. She intended for them to leave, when…</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Tianming stood still and refused to go.</p>

  <p>Instead, he turned around and said in a loud voice, "If you want to trouble me, you can just come straight to me. Why did you have to mock a member of your own clan? You are being ridiculous by playing this kind of trick!"</p>

  <p>When he was done speaking, his words were followed by a series of claps.</p>

  <p>A man slowly walked out of the crowd. He wore a golden crown and a jade pendant, which made him look distinguished.</p>

  <p>All the other people who saw that man quickly began to wait for a good show.</p>

  <p>That man was born and raised in the Floating Island, and his father was a Holy Being of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Although he had very outstanding talent, his name had never appeared on the Jade Wall of Legends. It was said that it was because his father didn't allow him to enter the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you have performed outstandingly in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Now, you seem to at least have the guts to challenge me— so let's go straight to the point. I'll be very glad to spar with you," the man said as a tinge of arrogance flashed across his eyes.</p>

  <p>The corners of Tianming's lips curled up. He was always down to accept such a challenge. Simply put, he wouldn't miss any chance to train and improve himself.</p>

  <p>The scene in the Heavenly Dragon Region of the divine land looked like it came out of a wild fantasy.</p>

  <p>A huge mountain called the Thunderstorm Mountain stood out against a backdrop of a balmy sky.</p>

  <p>Bolts of golden lightning had constantly flashed at the top of the mountain range for countless years.</p>

  <p>It was so dangerous that even a True God had to be very careful while walking in the Thunderstorm Mountain. It was certainly not fun to get struck by the golden lightning in the sky, and possibly die in misery.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a top-rank True God with powerful strength was able to walk in the mountain alone.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the mid-rank and low-rank True Gods would have to form a team and employ all kinds of ways to protect themselves from the powerful lightning.</p>

  <p>This day, however, a low-rank True God traveled alone in the Thunderstorm Mountain.</p>

  <p>He didn't have company, nor any protective gear other than a broken sword.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With a flash of golden light, the thunder rumbled with a deafening sound.</p>

  <p>The True God raised his head. A sliver of fear was evident in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that I have to go into the mountain alone? I think it's better for me to wait and form a team with other True Gods. What do you think?" he muttered helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Team up with others? Ha-ha! Your cultivation base is too low, and everyone will just look down upon you. Who would want you to join them? Moreover, we are going to find the secret treasure in the mountain. Do you plan to share it with others? You are the weakest among all the Godly Geniuses, the least talented and the most cowardly one! If you don't cultivate harder, you won't even be qualified to watch from the sidelines in the future!" his sword mocked.</p>

  <p>This low-rank True God was Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman. He had sneaked into the divine land not long ago after he became a True God.</p>

  <p>The first thing he did after he entered the divine land was take the secret treasure in the Thunderstorm Mountain, which was a treasure the former owner of the broken sword had left behind.</p>

  <p>Although what the broken sword said was true, Lone still felt somewhat indignant.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he can't deny the fact that he had only stood out among the geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe with the help of the broken sword.</p>

  <p>Even after he had entered the divine land, he had to rely on this sword to guide him.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that the broken sword had given him everything he had.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a coward!" he retorted. He boosted his speed, turned into a beam of light, and flew down the undulating mountain road.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Once he had set foot on the Thunderstorm Mountain, the golden lightning in the sky kept striking at him as if it had finally found a target.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he cleverly used his special bodily movement skill which enabled him to move quickly like a loach in the water and avoid all the thunder strikes.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods in the Thunderstorm Mountain noticed Lone, and they all looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Look, a low-rank True God came on his own!"</p>

  <p>"He really wants death!"</p>

  <p>"This boy is quite flexible. He has barely avoided the thunder at the outer area of the mountain, but if he enters the inner area, he would die thousands of times..."</p>
