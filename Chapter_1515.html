<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes, the entire world had undergone an earth-shattering change.</p>

  <p>His projection had already entered another world, a humongous Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>This sort of massive Illusion Space was equal to fifty supreme worlds!</p>

  <p>In reality, the Illusion Space was divided into fifty parts. Each of the parts looked like separate supreme worlds and all the warriors were scattered throughout the fifty supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was currently in a large city inside one of those supreme worlds. The place was packed with warriors from all different races. All of them were at the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>After getting up, Luo Luo Zheng looked around at the scenery.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield looked so real that it could be mistaken for a real supreme world. However, the Illusion Battlefield was in a closed state most times and there were only a few chances for warriors to enter it when it opened.</p>

  <p>The city before Luo Luo Zheng didn't look like a human city.</p>

  <p>All the buildings' roofs were painted with just two colors, black and red.</p>

  <p>There was also a faint red light circulating constantly in the cracks of the buildings. It was the stone materials used for these buildings. The stones contained a layer of flowing magma!</p>

  <p>"The ogre's city?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The myriad of warriors from one hundred thousand supreme worlds were also distributed within this Illusion Space according to a certain rule.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was located in the Northern Sky Region which was relatively close to the ogre's city. Thus, there was a huge possibility for him to be distributed in the city of ogres.</p>

  <p>Looking around, he noticed that all warriors surrounding him were as tall and sturdy as small mountains. There were only a small number of human warriors and warriors from other races.</p>

  <p>Unfriendly gazes showed on the ogre warriors' faces the moment they saw Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't pay much attention to them.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter which region he was in.</p>

  <p>The battle of the Illusion Battlefield was only for the strongest young warriors of the entire universe. In other words, everyone had to face trillions of opponents!</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had to face trillions of Soul Sea Realm warriors, it was no longer important if his opponents were human beings, ogres, or from other races. What was important to him now was to defeat all his opponents and become the sole winner in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would think this way, but the other human warriors might not. The human warriors that were assigned to this city all looked extremely morose and depressed.</p>

  <p>Some of the human warriors were relatively close to the ogre's territory before they entered the Illusion Battlefield. Such as those human warriors from the sacred place of the Dark World. After they entered the battlefield, some of them might be allocated to the city of humans, and some of them to the city of the ogres.</p>

  <p>However, there were also some human warriors who were unintentionally assigned to this place even though they were far away from the ogre's territory.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter was that everyone there would be competing with each other regardless if they were of the same race. Since this place was called a battlefield, everyone would be his or her opponent in the Illusion Battlefield and it didn't matter which race the opponent came from.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield had just opened and the warriors of all the races were very curious about this new world, constantly observing it.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a cold voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"Flying and fighting are prohibited in all large cities. Those who violate the rules will directly 'die'. There are still four hours left before the city gates open!" This voice belonged to that mysterious girl, who had completely transformed into a different person right after the Illusion Battlefield opened. Her voice became extremely cold and detached as she announced the rules of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Illusion Battlefield were extremely important, so Luo Luo Zheng focused on memorizing every single word of these rules silently.</p>

  <p>Just as the mysterious young girl finished speaking, a rough voice boomed all over the place.</p>

  <p>"All human warriors, get over here!"</p>

  <p>Not far from Luo Luo Zheng, over a hundred ogre warriors gathered together, surrounding all the warriors from other races!</p>

  <p>There were ten more other human warriors in the same place as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their faces immediately showed fear when they heard the roaring voice.</p>

  <p>Since it was mentioned that fighting was prohibited within the city, Luo Luo Zheng was certain that the ogres wouldn't dare to hurt anyone while here.</p>

  <p>However, after thinking for a while, those human warriors obediently walked towards the ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>A trace of indifference appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he turned a deaf ear to the ogre warrior's words.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go over there?" one of the human warriors suddenly asked Luo Luo Zheng. He was wearing a gray cloak and had a long thin pipe in his hand. He was puffing out smoke rings with a calm expression.</p>

  <p>"Why do I have to go over there? Fighting is prohibited in the city, so these ogres would not dare beat me," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, they might be very supercilious and brutal." The human warrior who was smoking his pipe added, "That ogre warrior in the lead should have a privileged background. If you disobey him, you might be in great trouble."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shrugged. "Maybe you're the one who would get me into great trouble..."</p>

  <p>After he finished talking, the two of them grinned at each other.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield might have gathered all the young elites in the universe. However, the warriors' strengths were still at different levels.</p>

  <p>Some of them were very powerful while some were weaker than others.</p>

  <p>The weaker warriors were just like a clump of grass. They could only be bullied and defeated by those stronger warriors.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the more powerful warriors were as aggressive as wolves. They were generally showing prominence over other warriors.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior in a cloak understood what each other was thinking. They were both outstanding and strong. Generally, they were both from the latter description of warriors, the wolves. Thus, they saw ordinary warriors around them as prey. They intended to compete with each other and strive for becoming the most powerful warrior!</p>

  <p>More so, they wanted to prove that they were better than one another.</p>

  <p>"You two! Come over here too! Are you deaf?" After the ogre warriors had gathered the other human warriors, one of them walked towards Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior in the cloak.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior in the cloak were leaning against the wall as if they hadn't heard anything. They didn't even bother to talk with those ogre warriors. In their eyes, that group of ogre warriors before them were nothing but a clump of weak grass.</p>

  <p>They both remained quietly standing there, waiting for the city gate to open.</p>

  <p>When the ogre warriors saw how they deadpanned them, they all strode forward and surrounded Luo Luo Zheng and the guy in the cloak.</p>

  <p>"Brats, do you know whose territory this is? If you don't behave obediently..."</p>

  <p>Before one of the ogre warriors finished speaking, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with a cold light. He lazily shouted, "Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, every move he made possessed a formless majesty. The ogre warrior couldn't help but take two steps back after being intimidated by Luo Luo Zheng. It was like an invisible power that pushed him back. When the ogre regained his composure, his face was flushed red.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, a trace of fear was already visible in his eyes as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>The warrior in the cloak took a deep drag on his pipe and blew out a smoke ring. His eyelids drooped down as if he didn't see what happened.</p>

  <p>Just then, another warrior uttered, "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was an ogre warrior wearing a silver armor. His silver armor seemed to be a rare treasure and judging from its color, it could be ranked as a second-rank divine weapon. It was easy to gauge that the armor was a defensive tool that could even be compared with a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>"Young master Ezra! There are two human warriors here who do not want to follow your orders!" an ogre warrior said.</p>

  <p>Ezra, who was a tall and strong ogre, came out of the crowd and looked down at Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior in the cloak. He said coldly, "I'll give you two one more chance. Just obey me and line up over there!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior in the cloak glanced at each other.</p>

  <p>Ezra was as weak as a sheep in their eyes, so they believed that they could easily deal with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "Obey you? What good is there in doing that?"</p>

  <p>"I'll let you off after I kill you twice in the Illusion Battlefield!" Ezra responded coldly. It seemed that he regarded killing Luo Luo Zheng twice as a mercy to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The warriors wouldn't really die or leave the Illusion Battlefield after they were 'killed' in the Illusion Battlefield. Instead, they would return to the city to "revive". In Ezra's opinion, killing these foolish humans twice would be an act of kindness. If he had every intention of killing them, he could kill them countless times!</p>
