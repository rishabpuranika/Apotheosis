<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was only a teenager, and he had only been joking when he asked Yolande to kiss him.</p>

  <p>When remembering his experience of being locked up by her with her enchantments, he couldn't help but have come up with such an idea to revenge on her.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, Yolande kissed him on the cheek without any hesitation. After her lips had left his cheek, he gawked at her in shock for a while.</p>

  <p>The soldiers standing beside them stared in shock too. They didn't expect that Yolande would have agreed to his request so easily.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with her?' they wondered as they shook their heads.</p>

  <p>Ever since that little incident, Yolande spent almost all her time in her room, and Luo Luo Zheng never met or saw her again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yolande was already used to this kind of life. In addition to defending the city with the imperial army, she had been practicing cultivation in her room for most of her time.</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Luo Zheng was going to leave the city. He collected all his stuffs in a bag and hoisted it on his back before going out the door. He stopped in front of Yolande's house and looked at it for quite a long time before turning away.</p>

  <p>He began his path to his destination on foot. Since all the disciples of Cloud Sect had left, of course nobody would send another giant flying chariot to pick him up. Thus, Luo Luo Zheng had to go back alone.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the demon had been defeated and two demon kings had been killed. The demon's camps had reduced significantly as well.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the imperial army in the White Emperor City had completely destroyed the demons in the surrounding areas and Sky Forest. What was left to do was to plan the next counterattack to take back the Heaven tower and the Earth tower.</p>

  <p>However, these had little to do with Luo Luo Zheng because he was only a disciple of Cloud Sect, not a member of the imperial army.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had reached the boundary of White Imperial City, he headed for Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The trip to White Emperor City had definitely given him a lot of experience. Aside from refining his body into a middle-grade spiritual weapon by absorbing the demon's holy fire, he had gotten two crystals which were quite helpful for increasing his skills.</p>

  <p>Even more exciting for him was he felt a change in his lower abdomen.</p>

  <p>After he had been punched hard countless times, the warm currents gradually expanded his lower abdomen. Maybe it was time for Luo Luo Zheng to transform his life energy to life vitality. Once he succeeded, he would become a genuine nature creature!</p>

  <p>If everything went well, his skills and competence would improve a great deal!</p>

  <p>These thoughts made Luo Luo Zheng speed up more at a brisk pace.</p>

  <p>In the middle of his trip, he suddenly realized that he had passed through Sky Forest and entered the northernmost county of Burning Sky Empire-</p>

  <p>-G County.</p>

  <p>Compared with the other counties in the Eastern Region, counties in the north were not that prosperous.</p>

  <p>Aside from the fact that G County couldn't compare to the luxurious Imperial Capital, it was also much poorer than Luo Zheng's hometown, C County.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Luo Luo Zheng felt much better because after running wild alone for two days and nights, he could at least see people here. It wasn't a big deal for him to run half the land of Burning Sky Empire and return to Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>However, since he had no important mission to fulfill, it was unnecessary to rush. So, Luo Luo Zheng took his liberties and walked into a restaurant to rest after entering G County.</p>

  <p>The restaurant he chose was called Golden Moon Restaurant. Although it wasn't on par with Golden Wind Restaurant, it was already considered a luxury place for ordinary people. It could easily be taken as the most high-end restaurant in G County as well.</p>

  <p>The doors were opened by a polite waiter. After his journey of two days and two nights, Luo Luo Zheng looked weary and dirty.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the waiters of Golden Moon Restaurant were very experienced. They didn't look down upon Luo Luo Zheng because of the way he dressed. On the contrary, they were quite respectful to him.</p>

  <p>As far as the waiters were concerned, people like Luo Luo Zheng could be taken as a warrior. These men were usually very rich and generous. These waiters had learned from someone that the warriors had a kind of currency called cubic crystal. One could buy more than ten Golden Moon Restaurants with a cubic crystal. In these men's eyes, gold and silver were nothing at all.</p>

  <p>All those things they overheard about the cubic crystal were by no means empty gossips. But a small amount of the cubic crystals Luo Luo Zheng held could easily make an average family become rich.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had sat down at a table by the window, a waiter came to take his orders. Soon enough, delicious dishes and food were served in front of him.</p>

  <p>Since no one was dining with him, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have to care about table manners. He continuously munched on the dishes and food on the table without even raising his head. Soon, there were only scraps of leftovers on the table.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because Luo Luo Zheng ate too fast, people at the neighboring tables shot him dirty looks and whispered among themselves. However, he paid them no mind at all. What he thought about instead was where to get a horse after dinner, so that he could continue his journey as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>'If only I can get a flying chariot in G County!' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, but he knew that there was little chance that his wish would come true.</p>

  <p>In a county of this size, it was possible however to buy a swift horse like the flying dragon horse or the lightning horse. Although not as fast as the flying chariot, they could help Luo Luo Zheng to speed up his journey and save his energy. 'The waiters might know where I can buy a swift horse. I'd better ask them later, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng busied himself with finishing the remainders of his meal, a group of guys had entered the restaurant and walked upstairs. They spoke rather noisily and looked quite arrogant. One of them reached into his pocket and pulled out two pieces of gold bullion, each piece of them was about the size of a fist. He banged them loudly on the table and looked around.</p>

  <p>"Waiter, bring us the best wine and dishes of this restaurant!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>The man who seemed to be their leader stretched his limbs carelessly as he slouched on his chair and ordered the waiters in a raucous voice.</p>

  <p>All the waiters were dumbfounded at the sight of the big gold bullion the man had slapped on the table. They immediately served these guys with much bowing and fussing over their meals.</p>
