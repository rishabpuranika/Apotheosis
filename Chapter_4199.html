<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whatever the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was theorizing was mere speculation. However, the conclusions they were drawing from the limited clues they had found seemed reasonable enough.</p>

  <p>"What have we got to lose? We have to take a risk and try, right?" Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded. He agreed with Zheng. "We have no other choice."</p>

  <p>Their adventure had begun the moment they had stepped foot in the Jade Pure Realm. They had no way back and the only way out was through.</p>

  <p>Now, they simply had to take this final step.</p>

  <p>"Let us see just how angry the Human Spirit King will be," Zheng remarked, walking up to the door and pushing it open.</p>

  <p>The stooped old man suddenly raised his head. There was a hint of hope gleaming in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't aware of one very important thing. The old man was not yet awake and was still trapped in the Treacherous Being's consciousness sea.</p>

  <p>However, he could still feel, hear, and react to the outside world.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had almost screamed out what he had just said!</p>

  <p>The old man also hoped to wake up. He cleaned up the bodies of human spirits only because they were the members of his sect. This was just a secondary task. His greatest obsession, however, was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.</p>

  <p>If Kincaid could wake up, so could he.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng pushed the door open, an invisible hand grabbed him and dragged him inside.</p>

  <p>Although this force was powerful, it was still possible for Zheng to quite easily resist it. However, he allowed himself to be dragged in.</p>

  <p>To his immense surprise, the other side of the door was not an ice palace.</p>

  <p>It was an open stone house. But that wasn't the most surprising part.</p>

  <p>"Every single stone in this house... is a Holy Stone!"</p>

  <p>Zheng gasped. As soon as he had come in, he had felt the aura of the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>"That's not everything. These are the highest quality of Holy Stones. I now understand why the Snake Spirit King died here," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord also piped in.</p>

  <p>Fighting in such an environment would be highly disadvantageous for the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was looking straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Right in the center of the stone house, a burly man was floating mid-air.</p>

  <p>He was wearing a heavy black armor, and his entire body, including his face, was covered by it. They couldn't guess what material the armor was made of, and it emitted a highly strong deterrent force. Even approaching the man would take effort.</p>

  <p>The most eye-catching thing about him was the heavy sword that was beside him.</p>

  <p>It was ten feet long and was almost as tall as the man himself. There was a faint red light flashing on the irregularly shaped blade.</p>

  <p>Was this the Human Spirit King, Kincaid?</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully observed the black armor from the distance.</p>

  <p>Before he could say something, a solemn voice came from the black armor.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard the black armor speak, his heart was filled with joy. The fact that the man had first questioned him was a good sign.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that the man would directly attack him without communicating with him. Since the Human Spirit King was rather famous and powerful, he was unwilling to fight against him if he could avoid it.</p>

  <p>The voice did not seem mechanical, indicating that the man was still rational and could think for himself. This was easily the best that could be made of this situation!</p>

  <p>Zheng took two steps forward, cupped his hands and said, "I'm Zheng, a human being from the chaos!"</p>

  <p>Human beings and human spirits were almost the same in appearance. In fact, in the third-grade world, human beings could easily be called extensions of the human spirits.</p>

  <p>According to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's conjecture, the Human Spirit King most likely wouldn't attack Zheng. However, conjectures could turn out to be false.</p>

  <p>"You're not the one I'm waiting for. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With that angry snap, the irregular heavy sword flew up in the air, and then suddenly rushed forward, breaking through space and slashing at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"What..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was filled with depression at this.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, he had been feeling rather lucky and pleased, but now, the man was attacking him. He was shocked and caught off guard.</p>

  <p>Reflexively, he leaned back, and the sword almost grazed his nose as it shot past him.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>The wall behind Zheng exploded and a series of dark red shock waves could be seen emanating from where the sword had hit.</p>

  <p>"The destruction quadrant! The thirteenth ability... the nineteenth... the twenty-sixth... the thirtieth..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline quickly analyzed the power of the heavy sword when it saw those explosions. Although what they were seeing was perhaps not as domineering as the power of the Monkey Spirit King, it seemed to be more formidable somehow.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ancestry-level bloodline had analyzed the power of this sword strike, the heavy sword disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>When it appeared once again, it was no longer a single sword, but seven!</p>

  <p>These seven heavy swords seemed unreal. They were constantly flashing with some sort of light, and even looking at them could give people a headache.</p>

  <p>"The space-time quadrant. The first ability, the third, the thirty-third..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's mind quickly analyzed the abilities hidden in the heavy swords. It came naturally to him now.</p>

  <p>"It's just one sword, but it is using an ingenious space theurgy that is not commonly visible. The blood power doesn't seem to be coming from the Human Spirit King, but from the heavy sword itself. Is it possible for the sword to also inherit the power of the ancestry-level bloodline?"</p>

  <p>While Zheng was analyzing the seven heavy swords, his figure flashed slightly, like a willow leaf floating out. His movement technique also contained a mysterious space theurgy that he had received from the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Every single one of the seven swords failed to hit Zheng!</p>

  <p>The next moment, he had appeared in front of the black armor.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I don't mean to offend you. I just want to know..."</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could finish his sentence, the armor had stretched out a huge black hand to grab Zheng's neck. At the same time, it spread out its other hand, and one of the huge swords appeared there all of a sudden. The hand then slashed horizontally, trying to cut Zheng into pieces.</p>

  <p>Zheng managed to slip away just in the nick of time. He avoided the sword attack and this time, trace of annoyance appeared in his eyes. "It looks like you want to determine the outcome of this fight before you are willing to talk! Very well, let's do that!"</p>

  <p>The scene that followed was remarkable. Zheng's body was constantly flashing all over the stone house as he moved around everywhere. The irregular heavy sword followed closely behind him like a maggot attached to its bone. The stone hall was filled with the shadows of Zheng and the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>The sword seemed to be moving at an astonishing pace, but Zheng was faster.</p>

  <p>With the help of the ancestry-level bloodline, he could control all the abilities of the entire space-time quadrant. This allowed him to even find out the possible future location of the sword and throw a punch in the right direction.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The shadows of the sword could be seen swinging wildly in a circle as the punch landed right on target.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline not only possessed unparalleled abilities, but also strengthened Zheng's body a few times once it had bonded with him.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's body was totally different from what it had been some time ago. He was much more powerful and a single punch was powerful enough to shake the fabric of space.</p>

  <p>After the punch had landed, Zheng's figure flashed once again. He arrived at a new position, and threw another punch in the air.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The sword blade was hit again.</p>

  <p>In terms of mastery over space and speed, Zheng had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Dong, dong, dong...</p>

  <p>The heavy sword received several blows again and again, as Zheng landed several punches on it within a span of a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Once the sword was hit by dozens of punches, a crack finally appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>"Break it!"</p>

  <p>Now it was Zheng who was chasing after the heavy sword and attacking it rapidly!</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a bright flash of a green light burst out from the crack, and the strong life energy that was emanating from within quickly repaired the crack.</p>

  <p>"The life quadrant. The thirty-sixth ability, the fortieth..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline once again analyzed the abilities which were being used to repair the sword.</p>

  <p>"This sword is so remarkable. Where did it come from?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little surprised now. A sword that actually had the abilities of several quadrants at the same time and could even repair itself when required!</p>

  <p>"It's the Life Iron..."</p>

  <p>"It comes from the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>You can think of it as a living being, as much as the man in front of you."</p>

  <p>The voice of the ancestry-level bloodline came from Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Although it had forgotten a lot of important things, some of its memories from the Deep Space were still well preserved.</p>
