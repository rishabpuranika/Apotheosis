<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3265 Saving Elvinia </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Chaim's Soul of Light had taken a lot of damage from his bout with the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>But he had no regrets; in fact, he was still optimistic. He took out some soul pills and swallowed them before turning his head to yell to Zheng, "Princess Elvinia is still being pursued by the Bearing race. Go after her!"</p>

  <p>Chaim didn't know who Zheng was, but he knew he was on the side of the Oneness Sky Palace, and that was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>While Chaim was being chased down by Haider, he had seen some people of the Bearing race going after the Oneness Sky Palace disciples. He wondered what had happened to them.</p>

  <p>"Elvinia?"</p>

  <p>"Why is she here?"</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Dorothy were stunned.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling took over Dorothy's heart. Her mind couldn't help but wander to what happened in the Vastness Mountain and what Flamine had said.</p>

  <p>"I'll save her,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, taking off in the direction Chaim had pointed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy pursed her lips, saying nothing.</p>

  <p>Zheng darted forward and before long, he caught sight of a dozen people fighting in the distance.</p>

  <p>A woman lay on the ground, wrapped by a little snake and unable to move.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had seen Elvinia on the Other Shore, but he could still recognize her by her silhouette.</p>

  <p>Elvinia, constricted by the Dragon Snake Trap, was so anxious that she was about to spit blood.</p>

  <p>She was more dissatisfied than she had ever been. She had never suffered any great losses on the Other Shore and so certainly didn't expect to end up in this situation.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace disciples were at a disadvantage. When they felt they had no chance of winning, they had opted to retreat from the Other Shore for the time being. However, the members of the Bearing race were fearless and soon there were only five disciples left to struggle through the battle.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Princess Elvinia. I... I can't stand it anymore!" The Soul of Light of a disciple had suffered greatly. He was left with no choice but to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Another two had no time to escape. The Bearing race killed them and they let out a piercing shriek as their Souls of Light collapsed.</p>

  <p>The last two disciples then saw it was hopeless, and decisively activated the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>Only Elvinia remained.</p>

  <p>"Two of us were killed because of this bitch!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you hear them? She is the direct descendant of Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"</p>

  <p>One member of the Bearing race hoisted Elvinia up and chuckled. "You're from the direct line, right? You were born noble, but what does that matter?</p>

  <p>Once we return to our base, mark my words, you will suffer!"</p>

  <p>"How... how dare you..." Elvinia shuddered with fear, unable to finish her words.</p>

  <p>Although the soul was not as strong as the body, no one had ever dared to threaten her like this.</p>

  <p>She knew if she fell into the hands of the Bearing race, they would do nothing but make her life torturous.</p>

  <p>"You just wait and see. We're on the Other Shore now. Eastern Emperor Taiyi will not come here for us!" the man of the Bearing race scoffed arrogantly.</p>

  <p>"If Eastern Emperor Taiyi does show up, he will never return!"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace has been content to exercise sovereignty over an area for so many years. Although it is known as one of the three orthodox human forces, it actually enjoys an unwarranted reputation. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>A wind blew while the members of the Bearing race continued their sarcastic remarks.</p>

  <p>"Up here."</p>

  <p>They all snapped their heads up at the sound of a voice and felt a black shadow crashing down on them.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng smashed down on top of the one holding Elvinia. At the same time, he stretched his hand out and swept over the rest of the Bearing race around him. His hand shook slightly, and all the people who were touched by his hand collapsed.</p>

  <p>They didn't even have a chance to escape the Other Shore before they perished.</p>

  <p>Elvinia sat on the ground, dumbfounded by the scene before her.</p>

  <p>She had heard of what took place on the Stage Four, but she didn't know it was Zheng who had done all those amazing things.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Zheng wrapped his hand around Elvinia's back and pinched the little snake with his fingers, tearing the snake apart. He then said in a low voice, "Follow me."</p>

  <p>He had deliberately changed his voice, yet it still felt somewhat familiar to Elvinia.</p>

  <p>They had only met twice before, one at the Seven Mountains Meeting and the other at the Phoenix Palace, and so Elvinia just couldn't place the voice she heard. When she saw Zheng about to leave, she called out helplessly, "I...</p>

  <p>I'm too weak to walk."</p>

  <p>The Dragon Snake Trap had continued draining her soul force once it had grabbed hold of her. She was extremely weak now.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't leave her alone out here in the wild.</p>

  <p>He thought about it for a moment, picked her up under her arms and put her on his back to carry her away.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Elvinia had been carried on the back of a man, though this was only on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng's back felt like a solid stone to her. Her heart raced uncontrollably. She couldn't think clearly and her curiosity about this stranger raged.</p>

  <p>He had been helping the Oneness Sky Palace all this time so she assumed he must be a disciple of the palace.</p>

  <p>The palace might not have said as much, but everyone believed this to be true.</p>

  <p>"Are you a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Elvinia asked in a soft and sweet voice.</p>

  <p>Both times they had met, Elvinia always wore an imperious look on her face. Zheng was not used to this sudden change. He smiled and replied, "You could say that, but I'm not really."</p>

  <p>He purposely gave an ambiguous answer.</p>

  <p>Elvinia blinked and asked, "Is your body in the palace?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"May I meet you?" Elvinia asked kindly.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head without uttering a sound.</p>

  <p>He would not reveal the secret of his physical body to others unless it was absolutely essential.</p>

  <p>In the Sword Light Palace, he was left with no other choice and had to reveal the truth to Dorothy. If not for this, he would have joined the Oneness Sky Palace as an unknown disciple instead of letting Winchell bring him back.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was disappointed by his rejection. But Zheng had saved her life; she couldn't force him to show himself. More to it, she really didn't have the ability.</p>

  <p>Many other races still waited at the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Many of them were already growing impatient.</p>

  <p>"Ear Mice! We have given you the soul pills as you requested. When will you open the Grand Sky Temple?"</p>

  <p>"Were you lying? Do you even have the Other Shore Key?"</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice, of course, were waiting for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without Zheng's presence, they could not open the door easily.</p>

  <p>Although they had investigated Zheng's body through various channels, they were still surprised to see that he had shattered Haider's Soul of Light with a single blow. This kind of power made the Ear Mice overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stood beside Chaim, waiting for any sign of Zheng.</p>

  <p>She looked around and saw Zheng in the distance, carrying a Soul of Light on his back. She frowned and mumbled unhappily, "Why doesn't Elvinia walk by herself?"</p>

  <p>Chaim laughed on the inside. He knew Dorothy was just jealous.</p>
