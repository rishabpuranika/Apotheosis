  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage and Supreme Lord Sky both travelled to the Lower World in order to protect the eight Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>However, they did not expect to encounter the Torch Dragon and the supreme sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Something felt amiss and the two Supreme Lords suspected that there was something extraordinary that was hidden within the great world for these two to suddenly appear. This was no doubt conspired by the sorcerer race!</p>

  <p>They immediately sent a request for reinforcements to the head of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, their request was promptly received and the Celestial Position race mobilized right away. However, even if they reached their top speed, they still wouldn't be able to arrive on time. It didn't help that the entire universe was plunged in a state of chaos with the Supreme Lords of the Thoughtless Minds and Humanity Alliance too busy protecting their own territories.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage was still engaged in battle with the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>He could've killed the beast more quickly but the safety of the Godly Geniuses was his utmost priority.</p>

  <p>He did not expect that the Godly Geniuses would go to the back side of the world.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon waved its tail towards the Godly Geniuses. Supreme Lord Mirage's heart jumped to his throat. The beast's tail was powerful enough to crush the Godly Geniuses. If that happened, not even Lester would be able to revive them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was suppressed by the Torch Dragon's strange fire, which made it difficult for him to rush in and rescue them.</p>

  <p>The sight of the Torch Dragon's enormous tail made everyone's faces turn pale.</p>

  <p>An opponent of this level was much more powerful than the grand sorcerer!</p>

  <p>Eight Godly Geniuses working together could probably defeat a world lord, but it might not be enough for them to resist a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart sank at their helplessness.</p>

  <p>However, just in the nick of time...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood at the front.</p>

  <p>He had advanced through the void and threw a punch just as the Torch Dragon's tail reached him.</p>

  <p>The punch had not been fortified with the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng figured it might have been pointless anyway. The Torch Dragon's body was enormous and the boost from the dragon scales might not even be enough for his punch to have any effect at all.</p>

  <p>All he really intended was to block the attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only rely on this great world at that very moment.</p>

  <p>He had actually been hesitant at first. Blocking the Torch Dragon's attack had the possibility of also causing irreversible damage to the great world.</p>

  <p>He knew this based on experience. Back when he blocked the black light, he sacrificed more than five million mountains. All tall landforms were levelled and there was nothing but plains in the great world now.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of acres of forest were sacrificed.</p>

  <p>Every energy transfer brought catastrophic damage to the great world since Luo Luo Zheng transferred all the damage he endured.</p>

  <p>This time was different. Luo Luo Zheng chose to bear the brunt of the Torch Dragon's attack. Any more damage rerouted to the great world could destroy it entirely.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice.</p>

  <p>The ten Godly Geniuses were the universe's last hope according to Master Feng.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng did not fight back then all the Godly Geniuses would perish along with the hope for this universe's survival.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses all stood in silence.</p>

  <p>Previously, they had assumed that the difference in power among the top ten warriors wouldn't be too great.</p>

  <p>All of them were great warriors and were the main characters of this world of chaos. Luo Luo Zheng might hold a more important role but each of them remained indispensable.</p>

  <p>However, his actions just now proved that Luo Zheng's strength went way beyond anything they had ever expected.</p>

  <p>There had been no need to display these abilities in the Illusion Battlefield then and seeing it now shed new light on Luo Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>A sliver of hope shone through their doubts and helplessness as they watched Luo Luo Zheng fearlessly charge towards the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had the ability to block the attack!</p>

  <p>However, they immediately dashed their high hopes.</p>

  <p>It was too much to put all their faith in just one man.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might have been born with strong strength but that was not enough to make him more powerful than a Supreme Lord or a fierce Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>Even ten Supreme Lords would find it difficult to suppress a Torch Dragon, what more Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon's tail approached the eight Godly Geniuses like an extremely powerful whip.</p>

  <p>It felt like the sky itself was pressing down upon them.</p>

  <p>When trouble came, the strongest man was the one who dealt with it.</p>

  <p>Aside from Luo Luo Zheng, nobody else tried to resist the attack.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's fist and the Torch Dragon's tail collided, there was almost no sound at all.</p>

  <p>It was as if a whip hit an insignificant ant because of the huge size difference between the two.</p>

  <p>However, just as they thought they were about to witness Luo Zheng's end, a miracle happened!</p>

  <p>The moment the tail hit Luo Luo Zheng, it abruptly stopped!</p>

  <p>He had used his own body to block the Torch Dragon's tail and stopped its attack!</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>He was as big as a scale on the dragon's tail but, during their collision, he was able to shatter these scales.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's back was pressed against the great world, like a nail attached to a wall. The moment the Torch Dragon's tail swept over, it's power was taken away by Luo Luo Zheng and the impact from their collision even injured the beast.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage was in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race had something sinister up their sleeves while the Celestial Position was also plotting something. Supreme Lord Mirage found it absurd that even after all efforts of cultivating the eight Godly Geniuses, the Celestial Position still failed.</p>

  <p>He felt an overwhelming sense of despair.</p>

  <p>The scene in front of him gave him tremendous visual impact which was saying a lot since he was a Supreme Lord who had already lived for 130 million years.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng looked like a mantis that blocked an entire car with its frail forelimbs.</p>

  <p>The sight stunned everyone into silence.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Kurt, Nathan, Lawson, all of them were extremely</p>

  <p id="top_20">dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Even though Tianming felt that he understood Luo Luo Zheng best out of all of them, he couldn't deny that the young man still had a few secrets that they had yet to uncover and understand. Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng himself was also a bit dumbfounded by everything. He could not figure out just how he stopped the Torch Dragon. It seemed that even he did not fully understand his own strength.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Luo Zheng blocked the grand sorcerer's staff, Tianming had already speculated that his friend might have possessed a secret treasure that enabled him to resist such attacks. It was also possible that it was because Luo Zheng's life energy was extremely strong that even the Nether Spring Cicada could not completely absorb it.</p>

  <p>The second time Luo Luo Zheng attacked and bound that grand sorcerer, he also showed them his immunity to all poisons. It was impressive but they could still think of a multitude of reasons for this.</p>

  <p>However, what they were seeing right now was simply incomprehensible. It was something that they might never have an explanation for.</p>

  <p>Lawson rubbed his eyes but even after rubbing for a long time, the scene remained the same.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Blood flowed from Nathan's face. He was unable to perceive the massive outline of the Torch Dragon with just his perception alone. All he could feel was the faint sense of power that swept over them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng... has blocked the tail of that monster," Lucille whispered.</p>

  <p>"Are you.... kidding?" Nathan murmured back in disbelief. However, it was unlikely for Lucille to lie in this situation.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't seen this personally, perhaps nobody would ever believe that this event actually happened.</p>

  <p>"Aooo..."</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon suddenly let out a long and piercing cry.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a big deal if one scale fell or shattered on its body. What was a big deal was the fact that an ant managed to shatter it in the first place.</p>

  <p>It twisted its enormous body and prepared to strike down with its tail once again.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage was ready this time. He wouldn't make the same mistake twice.</p>

  <p>He would voluntarily give his life away if that meant ensuring the safety of these Godly Geniuses. The death of a Supreme Lord meant a new Crown of Destiny and a new Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>But nobody could ever replace a Godly Genius. There was nothing for creating a True God after all.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage battled with the Torch Dragon head-on. As he did so, the great world underwent a violent change.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had almost completely shifted away the Torch Dragon's power and allowed the great world to absorb it.</p>

  <p>A battle between Supreme Lords usually entailed the destruction of a supreme world, let alone a great world.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Luo Luo Zheng did his best to transfer the power evenly. Most of it was routed to the northern savage land. During this process, Luo Luo Zheng discovered something unexpected located in that place through the great world's will.</p>
