<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2606 The Agitated Exiles </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zelda was from the Warden race. Although her cultivation level was not too high, her insight and knowledge were unmatched compared to most ordinary people.</p>

  <p>She had not the slightest reason to panic.</p>

  <p>She could easily see that Zheng had brought over a number of exiles.</p>

  <p>At first, she had expected Zheng to join an esteemed force and gain a foothold within it before sneaking her and her brother into the bone tower for a while.</p>

  <p>They would then have planned to escape once they avoided the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Zelda was well aware that entering the bone tower was difficult. It was even more difficult to establish contact with the exiles.</p>

  <p>What she did not expect was for Zheng to not only come in contact with, but also gather so many exiles in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>She could see almost all of the exiles before her.</p>

  <p>This was perhaps their most unusual act over millions of years.</p>

  <p>With careful planning and scrutiny, they had adopted the best plan of action.</p>

  <p>The exiles had never actually gone head to head with the Warden race, so they did not know their real strength.</p>

  <p>After a round of discussions, Timotheus, Emily from the Snake Goddess race had come to a decision. With their utmost strength, they would take away Zelda and her brother, whom Zheng had mentioned.</p>

  <p>For the exiles, this rare opportunity was a godsend.</p>

  <p>All this was only possible because what Zheng claimed was true.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had cheated this group of exiles, however, his ending would have been certain.</p>

  <p>"You... You have succeeded. I didn't expect you to get so many people here," said Zelda, staring at Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled pleasantly. "It's their decision. They think that it's impossible to avoid the Warden race while sneaking you and your brother into the bone tower, so it's better we confront the Warden race head on!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zelda tilted her head, seeming to be lost in thought. "You think so much."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, what Zheng said was highly possible.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Warden race was not powerful, but since they were assigned to manage the prison, it was not easy to fight them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white figure flew down from the sky and plopped in front of Zelda.</p>

  <p>It was the woman from the Snake Goddess race, the most powerful exile in this world.</p>

  <p>Zheng already knew her by the name Emily.</p>

  <p>The members of the Snake Goddess race, the people of the other races, and even the exiles� all addressed her as Master Emily.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race had thousands of powerful masters in the Source World and she was one of the lot.</p>

  <p>As Emily landed, Timotheus and the exiles of several other races followed suit.</p>

  <p>Before hearing the news and going out in full force, the exiles had held back for a long time. They had nerves of steel, but now it was crunch time for them.</p>

  <p>If it was proved that Zheng or Zelda and her brother had lied to them, their plans would go up in flames, which would be disheartening for them.</p>

  <p>Even Emily's beautiful face showed a trace of nervousness. She looked at Zelda and asked with some hesitation, "Can you prove that you come from the Warden race?"</p>

  <p>"I can't prove it," Zelda replied.</p>

  <p>As the exiles heard this, their faces dropped, as if all their hopes had been shattered in an instant.</p>

  <p>"My brother can prove it however," Zelda continued.</p>

  <p>Their eyes flew to Luther, who stood behind Zelda.</p>

  <p>Seeing a large number of Other Shore Realm powerhouses staring at him, Luther fidgeted. He nodded to the crowd and said, "Yes, I can really prove it."</p>

  <p>"Prove it to me then," Emily said calmly, an indelible sternness seeping into her voice.</p>

  <p>Luther nodded again. He came to stand before Emily and put his index fingers and thumbs together, forming a frame with his hands. A pale brown light curtain manifested in the middle of the frame.</p>

  <p>The light curtain depicted the scene of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the exiles suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>They were all great masters at the Other Shore Realm and had a far more comprehensive and deeper understanding of energy than the ordinary Wild Gods and True Gods. Through the energy released from the light curtain, they perceived something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>As the light curtain slowly became clearer, Luther said to Emily, "Look, there are Curse Chains behind you."</p>

  <p>Emily turned to the direction of the light curtain. Timotheus and the other exiles also came forward.</p>

  <p>In the light curtain, they saw little golden insects linked together and extended into the distance.</p>

  <p>Emily took a deep breath. "I have felt the existence of such a chain, but today is the first time I have witnessed it in person."</p>

  <p>As an exile saw the Curse Chain through the light curtain created by Luther, a flash of golden red lightning escaped from his hand. The lightning turned into a jumping lightning blade. It carried a terrible power, as if it could destroy heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He did not hang back from waving the lightning blade at the Curse Chain.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the two kinds of energy did not interact. His lightning blade seemed to cut into the void. As for the light curtain, it seemed that the Curse Chain trapping the exile was motionless.</p>

  <p>With a pitiful smile, Luther said, "It's impossible to cut off the Curse Chain in this manner."</p>

  <p>The exile nodded listlessly. He too knew that the Curse Chain was not easy to cut off, but since he had encountered it for the first time, he could not help but want to have a try at it.</p>

  <p>"Is there a way to cut it out?" Emily looked at Luther. Her features now looked much softer and her smile was a little more charming.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is." Luther blinked. Being the center of attention of so many powerful people at such a young age, he could not help but puff up his chest a little. "In the Warden race, about thirty people can break the Curse Chain, and I am one of them."</p>

  <p>"Could you demonstrate it now?" Timotheus asked without pause.</p>

  <p>Shrugging in an exaggerated manner, Luther replied, "To break the Curse Chain, one needs to reach a special place, and my cultivation isn't high enough right now."</p>

  <p>"Cultivation? You are cultivating the True God system?" Emily frowned.</p>

  <p>She did not sense the Wild God Power from Luther's body. At the same time, she felt that Luther was trying to condense the life vitality.</p>

  <p>If he cultivated the Wild God system, it would become very simple. The wild bones, even the blood wild bones, were not worth much to the exiles, but it was a special feat to train a True God.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luther nodded. "But my progress has been slow."</p>

  <p>After fleeing from the Warden race, Zelda and Luther had wandered from one place to another, enduring many hardships. Luther simply did not get many opportunities to cultivate.</p>

  <p>After they had settled down in the Iron Tribe, however, Zheng taught him a method to cultivate life vitality. But it was not suitable for him to cultivate life vitality in this world. Although he had a great talent for the martial arts, it was still a long way to go before he became a proving godly warrior, given his current cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the other exiles turned to face Emily.</p>

  <p>Emily pursed her lips, the soft light illuminating her face. "Although I have never accepted any disciple before, I'll do my level best to help Luther."</p>

  <p>"That's very good. I'm afraid that no one here is more suitable for the task than you, Master Emily. After all, the Grand World Cultivation Method came from your race," Timotheus said with approval.</p>
