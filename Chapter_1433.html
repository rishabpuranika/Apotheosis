<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1433 The Creation of The Soul Sea </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng was startled as the supreme life vitality crystal suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>It shattered into tiny fragments, but the life vitality it contained did not shoot out. Instead, it was replaced by several wisps of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had transferred only a small amount of chaotic energy into the stone shell. Now, it had increased greatly from the original measure.</p>

  <p>However, due to the impact from the explosion, the currents of chaotic energy looked like thin whips that lashed out fiercely in all directions, leaving behind in its wake countless tiny dents in the room.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>From the dents, other strands of chaotic energy slowly rose up like little gray snakes.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened as he looked at the scene in front of him. He was beyond bewildered at what was happening.</p>

  <p>In only a few seconds, the small dents in the room had multiplied. The little gray snakes of chaotic energy quickly eroded everything in their surroundings, while giving rise to more strands.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, if you don't do anything about all this chaotic energy right now, this house will collapse!" The cyan dragon's words rang faintly in Zheng's ears with warning.</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Zheng finally came back to his senses!</p>

  <p>He waved his finger lightly, and the strands of chaotic energy quickly shrunk. One after another, the little gray snakes crawled out of every corner of the room and gathered in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now holding chaotic energy that was a thousand times larger than before. The wisp of chaotic energy that he had poured into the crystal was not much thicker than a thin thread. Now it was the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the chaotic energy can absorb much more than the life vitality in the crystal. If things have continued, it would have swallowed the whole house..." Luo Zheng said in a daze, staring at the mass of chaotic energy in his hand.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon broke through his musing. "It is capable of more than that. Chaotic energy would be able to devour everything..." he said.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was unable to keep his composure at the turn of events.</p>

  <p>The suggestion that Luo Zheng tried things for himself came from the cyan dragon, and from the look of things, the chances of failure were far greater than the chances of success.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had lived through hundreds of thousands of years and had seen many different kinds of cultivation methods. When Luo Zheng had first entered the Cloud Sect to select his cultivation method, the cyan dragon kept the Heavenly Ogre Fist in mind. It was a technique that could manipulate life vitality into such power that it would be able to ravage and devour everything. It was a very unique cultivation method, and its origins had remained unknown. No one could even be sure that it originated from the ogre.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been preoccupied with other things, and thus was not able to take time to discover the history behind this cultivation method.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had suggested that Luo Zheng fuse the characteristics of the Heavenly Ogre Fist with the chaotic energy that dwelt inside his body.</p>

  <p>The insatiate nature of the chaotic energy was far more forceful than the life vitality. Not only could it devour the life vitality, it could even devour the entire house.</p>

  <p>Even the cyan dragon himself could not help but be astounded...</p>

  <p>An elated expression was on Zheng's face when he recovered from shock.</p>

  <p>Even his master might not have conceived such an attempt.</p>

  <p>What his master wrote about the Primal Chaos Technique had only been speculations. He surmised that breaking into the Soul Sea Realm would yield the same results for chaotic energy as it would with life vitality.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy would liquefy and turn into the sea of chaos. Perhaps his master had neglected other considerations.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed when he thought of this. He raised his hand and tentatively pointed a finger. The next instant, the mass of chaotic energy in front of him shot towards a square table in the corner!</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>The coagulation of chaotic energy passed through the center of the square table, puncturing it with fist-sized hole.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's control, chaotic energy flowed continuously along the square table. It was as if it housed an invisible monster. Within a few seconds, the table had been completely devoured.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng collected the bulk of chaotic energy in his hands. Its size had increased even more from before.</p>

  <p>"Fascinating! The chaotic energy keeps on devouring everything I direct it towards. When the chaotic energy in my body condenses enough, it would be able to liquefy and turn into a sea!" Zheng's eyes kept flashing.</p>

  <p>The process seemed to be a bit of a troublesome task. Many other warriors were naturally able to create the Soul Sea in their bodies after reaching the Soul Sea Realm, but Luo Zheng was a different case altogether. He would have to go to greater lengths to form a sea in his body. In the end, however, it would yield him a greater reward. Chaotic energy could be found everywhere, and it was not particular with its source. With everything else at his disposal, the chaotic energy within his body would be inexhaustible, and Luo Zheng could make use of it as much as he needed or pleased.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the door swung open. Freya came inside with a pot of tea in her hands.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning, Luo Zheng had already told Freya not to bother serving him like a servant to a master. He did not need nor want her to act as if she was of a lesser status. However, Freya maintained her actions and tried her best to take care of Luo Zheng. Numerous dents came into sight as she entered the room, and a strange expression appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Silently, she stepped back and exited the room...</p>

  <p>Freya was extremely respectful. She would not even glance at things that she were not supposed to see, and she never pressed Luo Zheng for details, waiting for him to tell her of his own accord instead.</p>

  <p>For the following stretch of time, Luo Zheng tested chaotic energy continuously, learning as much of its characteristics as he could.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng's demonic life vitality had not been as powerful in terms of devouring matter. It could devour ordinary life energy and life vitality directly, but it was at a much slower pace, especially if the items to be devoured were formed through visualization and imagination. Apart from this, there were some forms of conjured items that the demonic life vitality would not be able to ingest.</p>

  <p>Chaotic energy seemed to be more or less the same.</p>

  <p>When the chaotic energy absorbed ordinary things such as tables and chairs, it was able to do so at an incredible speed. It proved to be the same with materials made of wood or clay. Metals, on the other hand, took a little bit more time to be devoured.</p>

  <p>With this discovery, Luo Zheng proceeded to fetch various things and fed them to the chaotic energy, including precious things such as mysterious weapons, spiritual weapons, fairy weapons, and other treasures.</p>

  <p>What he discovered with this was that the higher the grade and the more powerful the weapon was, the longer it took the chaotic energy to absorb it. In order to test this further, Luo Zheng had even let the chaotic energy swallow a sacred weapon. It took about half a day for it to be completely ingested. With this pattern, an even longer time would be needed for the chaotic energy to devour a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng fed the chaotic energy weapon after weapon� its amount increasing at every instance. He felt his belly expand with the massive size of the energy.</p>

  <p>Ever since he started training the Primal Chaos Technique, the internal world started to slowly refine the chaotic energy. Upon reaching a certain amount, it had stopped increasing, and he did not feel full for a long time.</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Zheng continued to devour things with his chaotic energy, the chaotic energy inside him increased, and the entire inner world began to narrow down, making the chaotic energy contained within him start to condense.</p>

  <p>Once the concentration of chaotic energy had reached its limit, it would be able to liquefy. Luo Zheng continued to pour chaotic energy inside him while paying attention to the changes in his body.</p>

  <p>He was not disappointed.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, his inner world was made visible� masses of chaotic energy gathered together and formed a brown colored liquid that quickly sank into the depths.</p>

  <p>After the first portion of chaotic energy started to liquefy, the entire internal world underwent a tremendous change. As the brown liquid continued to form, edges had begun to appear...</p>

  <p>For six days, the liquefaction continued. On the seventh day, the brown sea in Zheng's inner world began to slowly fluctuate. He had already stepped into the Soul Sea Realm after passing through ten small Heavenly Tribulations, but he had only truly created the Soul Sea today.</p>

  <p>Compared to other Soul Sea Realm warriors' Soul Seas, his was much different... The constantly churning waves of his Soul Sea would enable chaotic energy to completely swallow even a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Not long after Zheng's Soul Sea was established, a familiar voice rang in his ears. It was Lincoln who contacted him by burning the message rune Luo Zheng had given him before. It seemed that he had already arrived at the Auspice City!</p>

  <p>With Lincoln's invitation, Luo Zheng had arrived at the Dark World and had been waiting for word from him for a long time. Circumstances appeared to be in his favor, as Xun knew of some of the Dark World's secrets.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had every intention of getting the resources there.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng responded to Lincoln's message and told Freya to pack up and make preparations to set off.</p>
