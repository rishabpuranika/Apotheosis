<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The heavenly thunder of this Thunderbolt Annihilation was doled out as punishment after the heavens had been triggered.</p>

  <p>The power of the thunder that a normal Thunder Law could produce could not hold a candle to the might of it.</p>

  <p>The snake-like bolts of lightning writhed and intertwined with each other, and in the end, they turned into silver dragons that pounced down!</p>

  <p>Lawson and Lucille happened to be hovering in the sky above the thunder. Although they enjoyed the protection of the heavens law and wouldn't be harmed, they still swiftly maneuvered the stones under their feet to a hasty departure at the sight of the terrible scene.</p>

  <p>"BOOM! BOOM!"</p>

  <p>Countless bolts of lightning instantly fell down, turning where Nathan stayed into a prison of thunder and electrifying static!</p>

  <p>These beams of lightning created a dazzling spectacle, and when the other warriors fixed their eyes on them, they could only discern a brilliantly white space and could not clearly observe the scene...</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>The vast majority of spectators hadn't expected this turn of events.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had looked completely helpless only moments before, but now the fact that he'd successfully attracted such a large amount of formidable Thunder Tribulations had far exceeded their expectations.</p>

  <p>"The power of the Thunder Tribulations is extremely strong. Underneath the punishment of these tribulations, Nathan would surely be seriously injured even though he might not die."</p>

  <p>"Mm. These Thunder Tribulations probably won't be able to kill Nathan, given his strength. But he'll most likely verge on the cusp of death..."</p>

  <p>All the warriors discussed among themselves...</p>

  <p>The eleven Thunderbolt Annihilations arranged by Luo Zheng were not intended to be used only once, and he only needed to activate three Thunderbolt Annihilations at a time. The eleven Thunderbolt Annihilations would all together last for more than two minutes. No matter whether they were able to defeat Nathan or not, it would be enough to keep Nathan occupied as he fought back for a while...</p>

  <p>This alone might not prove enough.</p>

  <p>After he moved to one side, Zheng's gaze suddenly turned cold, and the sword in his hand once again condensed a sword intent!</p>

  <p>"Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>With a flash of golden light, a sharp sword beam shot straight towards the ring with a murderous intent!</p>

  <p>Although the flashes of lightning were powerful and it was almost impossible for anyone to look at it directly, Luo Zheng could still clearly see Nathan's figure.</p>

  <p>Right now, not only did Nathan have to face the Thunder Tribulations from the sky, but he also had to deal with the incoming Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike. He was in great danger at this moment...</p>

  <p>In the ring, Nathan was fighting for his life, and he had already reached a furious state.</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Zheng wasn't able to break through his spear skill in this battle, then he would already have been in an invincible position...</p>

  <p>However, he had fallen into the trap of the Thunder Tribulations due to his own carelessness!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>These Thunder Tribulations were dense, leaving Nathan no room to dodge.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Nathan had begun using a most unique movement technique!</p>

  <p>He seemed to be stepping on some sort of law, constantly moving within this ring of light. If someone were to have accurately measured Nathan's footsteps, they would have realized that his step's distance was three feet!</p>

  <p>Every single step he took was three feet long, and he placed each step's distance with extreme accuracy.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but his body's swaying scope always remained above one foot, and he stopped each time he took a step. When his body moved a distance of one foot, he would suddenly stop, and then turn one foot towards the next direction!</p>

  <p>No matter how he continued to dodge, he calculated every step he took.</p>

  <p>Most cultivators at this level had mastered the absolute control of their strength, and with one slash, they could cut off the legs of a mosquito without killing it.</p>

  <p>But Nathan's movement was so precise that it left the others both confused and shocked.</p>

  <p>With only his precise step, he was able to avoid most of the Thunder Tribulations. However, a small portion of the Thunder Tribulations still broke through and struck his head. Immediately, his entire body was charred black and he was covered in soot, making him a sorry picture of misery!</p>

  <p>In his fury, he suddenly sensed the incoming great threat!</p>

  <p>"This guy even dares to launch a sneak attack on me..."</p>

  <p>If other cultivators were to have fallen into this situation, they would most likely have died already.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't have managed to escape the streaks of heavenly thunder.</p>

  <p>Now Nathan also had to face Zheng's strongest sword strike, on top of everything... How difficult would it be to deal with it?</p>

  <p>However, Nathan, who had been indignant earlier, now became exceptionally calm...</p>

  <p>In his eyes, all the colors of the world had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The entire world became a blur, filled with countless lines...</p>

  <p>In his eyes, he saw the thirty-six thick lines crisscrossing on the Heaven Earth Board, but there were countless finer lines tangled up in a mess between the thick lines on the board. However, the stones arranged on the board had remained flawless, without a single line appearing on them...</p>

  <p>The more lines that marred an item, the more flaws the item would have.</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board was really easy to break, which was why Nathan could see there were many flaws exposed on it.</p>

  <p>However, the stones on the board could not be broken, and though there might be some flaws within them, Nathan could not see any in them.</p>

  <p>This was because of his current cultivation base not being high enough.</p>

  <p>Other than that, the streaks of heavenly thunder were also filled with cracks!</p>

  <p>Everything had its own rules as to how it worked, and the restriction of these rules was the various laws of the universe...</p>

  <p>The truth was that some laws had been unearthed by martial artists. They had carefully studied them until they had comprehended their profound mysteries. As for those Original Laws, they were the most important laws, and the number of warriors who cultivated them was the largest.</p>

  <p>At the same time, there were also some warriors who started cultivating some special laws instead of cultivating the ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>Those special laws included the Circulation of Stars, the Dream Revival, and the Rebirth in Darkness.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Stellar Body used the stars' law to activate the power of stars...</p>

  <p>These laws had all been created by the heavens.</p>

  <p>The heavens had been constructed by the Gods.</p>

  <p>The law of creation was the Truth Godly Way, and the other laws were all created based on the truth.</p>

  <p>It was also the most important one among the 3, 000 Godly Ways, and had spawned countless other ways that had existed for billions of years.</p>

  <p>It was also the foundation of the existence of the Gods...</p>

  <p>Nathan's Comprehension of Truth allowed him to pierce through the operations of the myriad of laws in the world with his sight, so all he perceived were lines and points. That was the most essential scene in this world!</p>

  <p>Although the spear in his hand was a supreme divine weapon, it was not the most prominent treasure.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't need an extremely powerful weapon.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, anything could reveal a huge flaw!</p>

  <p>And the power of the Law Spear Strike that he cultivated was actually far greater than what everyone had seen. This was because the Law Spear Strike could follow through those invisible flaws to directly attack and defeat its opponent!</p>

  <p>That was the reason why Nathan brought down so much pressure on Kurt.</p>

  <p>Before his confrontation with Kurt, the Law Spear Strike had already been targeted at Kurt's greatest flaw.</p>

  <p>Three inches to the right of Kurt's chest was a small, circular dot. Thin lines spread out from that small dot, and most of these thin lines traced to Kurt's heart, while a small portion of these lines spread into his mind and even connected to his soul!</p>

  <p>If he had decided to use the Law Spear Strike to break through it, he would be able to completely disintegrate Kurt, destroying his soul, state of mind, and physical body...</p>

  <p>That was why he had applied so much pressure on Kurt.</p>

  <p>That dot was Hurt's lifeline!</p>

  <p>Several years ago, Kurt had cultivated the Golden Bell Defense, and he discovered that three inches to the right side of his chest was his barrier.</p>

  <p>But Kurt had never imagined that such a large flaw would appear on this barrier...</p>

  <p>Actually, when Nathan first saw Luo Zheng, he had felt a bit confused.</p>

  <p>He could see the flaws of all things by means of his Comprehension of Truth.</p>

  <p>The stronger one was, the fewer number of flaws they would have...</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Soul Sea Realm would usually have more than a hundred flaws.</p>

  <p>While there should be dozens of flaws appearing on the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Usually, Nathan could only see around ten flaws in a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>He could only occasionally perceive one flaw in a world lord; although sometimes there were even none.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord had already surpassed the scope of Nathan's Comprehension of Truth, so it was impossible for him to assess their likes.</p>

  <p>However, there were only four lines on Zheng's body, and Nathan could not figure out where his vital point lay!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just a Soul Sea Realm warrior, so how could he only have a few flaws within his physical body? The number of his flaws was even smaller than that of a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior's flaws.</p>

  <p>Nathan was bowled over in confusion by this.</p>

  <p>However, it really didn't matter. Luo Zheng still had a few flaws, instead of having no flaws.</p>

  <p>As long as there were flaws, Nathan's Law Spear Strike would be able to display its terrifying destructive power.</p>

  <p>The spear light that he had shot out had once struck Zheng's earlobe. A thin line had then appeared on his earlobe and extended all the way to the top of his head before spreading downwards.</p>

  <p>The purple spear light was not even that powerful, but it had still almost broken Luo Zheng into two from the middle!</p>

  <p>From this, it could be believed that it wasn't too difficult for Nathan to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Nathan was striding forward with his long spear pointing up into the sky. He no longer chose to evade the thunder strikes, and instead aimed up at the sky with a fierce thrust!</p>

  <p>"Break them for me!"</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, multiple Law Spear Strikes were launched, one after another.</p>

  <p>The rays of purple spear light were like thin lines, precisely piercing through the violent thunderbolts descending at him.</p>

  <p>Even though these lightning bolts were of the heavenly thunder, they still had their flaws.</p>

  <p>When those flaws were struck by the purple spear light, the lightning bolts became like snakes that had been struck, breaking apart, collapsing, and dissipating!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, none of the thunderbolts that filled the sky landed on Nathan any further!</p>
