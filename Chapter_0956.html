<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bess had never killed anybody before. But she was ruthless when it came to the warrior who was taking advantage of her friend. She made the flying sword spin when it pierced through his chest, creating a big hole.</p>

  <p>"Wray!"</p>

  <p>Barnard and his four companions had fought life-threatening battles over the years together. They had never failed due to their caution and strategic attacks. Who would have thought that one of them would be killed in the pursuit of these three girls?</p>

  <p>Barnard roared and tried to get a hold of Bess so that he could torture her.</p>

  <p>Bess had already stopped resisting; her face was filled with determination. She was already prepared to die as she knew she would never be able to defeat her powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>But Barnard suddenly stopped in front of her as if he was frozen on the spot.</p>

  <p>Bess heard an indifferent voice, "Use your flying sword to stab him again. Let's see if you can kill him."</p>

  <p>She was slightly stunned. She looked around, but nobody was there. It looked like someone had cast a spell on the man in front of her. He stood there in a daze, not moving at all. This was a golden opportunity for her.</p>

  <p>She did not hesitate the slightest bit. She summoned the flying sword back to her and thrust it towards Barnard's face.</p>

  <p>Although Barnard couldn't move his body, he could still speak. "You stinking bitch! How dare you!" He was scared of Bess now. Her determined expression told him she was certainly going to kill him.</p>

  <p>"Who is it? Show yourself! You bastard!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure slowly appeared behind Bess. He looked at Barnard nonchalantly as if he was looking at a dead man.</p>

  <p>When Barnard saw Luo Luo Zheng standing there unharmed, he was filled with rage and shock. 'Wasn't this guy severely injured? He is just a warrior at the early stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm. Facing three warriors at the late stage of Internal Elixir Realm wouldn't have been easy for him. But where are the three elders? Are they all dead?' Barnard thought to himself.</p>

  <p>'That can't be possible!'</p>

  <p>Barnard's speculations ended as Bess' flying sword pierced through his head, leaving behind a trail of blood. The flying sword then fell powerlessly into the sea.</p>

  <p>Bess turned around and saw that the man in front of her was the same one she and her companions had pulled out from the sea.</p>

  <p>"Please hurry! Save my friends!" Bess had been nervous the whole time.</p>

  <p>After killing two warriors, she was on the verge of collapsing. Now that she was safe, she allowed her exhaustion to take over. She closed her eyes and passed out.</p>

  <p>She came around after a long time. She propped herself on her elbows and saw both her friends lying beside her. Although their clothes were in disarray, their breaths were smooth. Thankfully, they were completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>'Did that man save them too?' she thought.</p>

  <p>She raised her head and saw the man sitting on another reef attending to his wounds.</p>

  <p>She flew over and landed lightly on the reef. She sized up the slightly skinny man in front of her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked up and saw Bess. "You're awake," he noted.</p>

  <p>Bess nodded, "Thanks a lot, sir. May I know your name?"</p>

  <p>"You are welcome. But if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have gotten involved in this in the first place. It was your act of kindness that saved you," Luo Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>However, Bess insisted, "My father always says that we should be grateful. That's all I know."</p>

  <p>A wistful smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face at her naive personality. 'Didn't her father teach her not to trust strangers? No wonder she is so simpleminded. If she remains innocent, she will eventually get hurt one day, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Then he shook his head and said, "My name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo? You are that Luo Luo Zheng? Luo Luo Zheng from the Cloud Hall?" Bess' eyebrows shot up. She would have never thought this man would be the famous Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've heard of me?" Luo Luo Zheng asked casually. Actually, he was not too surprised that she knew him.</p>

  <p>There were many people in the Central Region who knew of him. Ever since he had fought in the Martial Arts Contest and left midway, he was known all over the world.</p>

  <p>After that, he had helped the Cloud Hall build the strongest sect-protecting array, and relied on it to provoke Eddie. This move made him even more famous. At that time, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm. It wasn't a good idea for a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm to provoke the strongest man in the Central Region, but he did so and it made him a legend among the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Countless versions of his story were being spread among people, and no matter which version they heard, everyone's heart surged with emotions.</p>

  <p>"Of course I've heard of you, but aren't you at the Illuminating Soul Realm? How did you already reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm?" Bess looked him up and down a few times. "And the rumors in the Central Region say that you are already dead!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. He didn't care about himself, but was more worried about the situation in the Cloud Hall and his sister.</p>

  <p>"What is the current situation in the Central Region?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bess wasn't really the type to keep abreast of the situation in the Central Region. She was more interested in hearing about Luo Zheng's legendary story.</p>

  <p>However, as an inner disciple of the Fish Dragon Sect, she still knew a little bit about the situation.</p>

  <p>"Right now, all the sects in the Central Region are united. It is believed that they want to eliminate all independent warriors," Bess said, pouting her lips.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Bess explained, "They are forcing all the independent warriors to join the sects. That's why our Fish Dragon Sect is filled with many warriors, good and bad. Alas! This is so frustrating!"</p>

  <p>The eight warriors that had been killed by Luo Luo Zheng and Bess today were all once independent warriors. Elder Hu had joined the Fish Dragon Sect a little earlier, so he managed to become an elder of the sect.</p>

  <p>"How is the Cloud Hall?</p>

  <p>What about the World Commercial Alliance?</p>

  <p>And Ethereal Spirit Sect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng bombarded her with questions, but Bess stared blankly at him. He understood that she clearly didn't have any clue about it.</p>

  <p>"Do your friends know?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he noticed that the other two girls were also slowly waking up.</p>

  <p>"No, they don't," Bess answered decisively on behalf of her friends.</p>

  <p>Sighing in defeat, Luo Luo Zheng said, "Fine. The Fish Dragon Sect isn't too far from here, is it?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't. I can show you the way!" Bess was glad for the opportunity to help Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two girls were fully awake now. So the four of them proceeded to the Fish Dragon Sect. After the two girls learned of Luo Zheng's identity, the three women had been chattering non-stop and almost forgot about the harrowing experience they had just been through.</p>

  <p>They talked non-stop and threw all sorts of questions to Luo Luo Zheng, which immediately gave him a headache.</p>

  <p>Finally, Xun couldn't take it anymore. She turned into spots of red light and emerged from Luo Zheng's body, knocking the three of them out. "You three, shut up!" she yelled.</p>

  <p>The three girls immediately went silent. Xun's sudden appearance scared them, but it only lasted for a few seconds before the three surrounded Xun and started bombarding her with questions.</p>

  <p>"Sis, why is your skin so pale?"</p>

  <p>"What material is your robe made of? Why does it seem like it is woven from tree leaves? But it's very robust!"</p>

  <p>"Huh? Sis, why are your ears so sharp?"</p>

  <p>Xun rolled her eyes helplessly and said to Luo Luo Zheng, "I can't help you anymore!" She then turned into spots of red light again and re-entered Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Fish Dragon Sect was built on a mountain near the sea.</p>

  <p>After flying over the sea, Luo Luo Zheng noticed a large sect.</p>

  <p>Although the Fish Dragon Sect was only a third-grade sect, it had quite a few disciples. There were enough disciples to occupy around a third of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>This was also because there were too few humans on the Sea God Continent. Any decent sect in the Central Region had millions of disciples, and some large sects had tens of millions of disciples each, such as the Cloud Hall and the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the entrance of the Fish Dragon Sect, several hundred streaks of light flashed out from the sect. These streaks of light came from the constant operation of the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>Shortly after they arrived, two beams of light shot over to them. They were two warriors at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>One of them questioned Luo Luo Zheng, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Bess smiled and replied, "Elder Yu, this is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo from the Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo from the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>The two elders looked at each other in dismay. One of them had a confused expression. "Didn't Luo Luo Zheng from the Cloud Hall already die? Why are you pretending to be him?" he asked warily.</p>
