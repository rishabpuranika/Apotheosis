<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't able to find any valuable clues from the metal debris.</p>

  <p>The Metal Civilization had its own words that differed from the Sanskrit words. Because of this, it was impossible for Zheng to understand them given the time constraint.</p>

  <p>After collecting a few special-looking metals, Zheng crossed the area where the piles of debris were.</p>

  <p>The piles of debris were closely connected and floated through the air.</p>

  <p>Some of them had remarkable features, though Zheng could just vaguely recognize the civilizations to which they belonged. Most of them were stones and fragments of buildings from ancient civilizations. Zheng even found an entire mountain in the pile of debris.</p>

  <p>"This is a whole mountain."</p>

  <p>As he stood upon the top of the mountain, Zheng unleashed his spiritual sense into it and examined its interior.</p>

  <p>Inside the mountain, some caves contained corpses of small animals.</p>

  <p>Judging from their appearances, it was hard to tell how long they had been dead in there.</p>

  <p>"It's kind of strange," Zheng noted as he furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" No. 9527 inquired.</p>

  <p>"How could the corpses of these small animals be well preserved?" Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>It would be quite normal for the dead bodies made up of metal to not decay for countless years.</p>

  <p>However, the corpses were of common animals. Naturally, they would have decayed already after being dead for so long.</p>

  <p>This unnatural phenomenon raised Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>"That's not surprising at all," No. 9527 answered indifferently. "Time does not exist here. Even if they have been dead for millions or billions of years, their bodies will remain the same."</p>

  <p>There was no concept of time in the space they were in.</p>

  <p>Zheng got a bit of a hard time believing that this phenomenon could exist.</p>

  <p>Just when he withdrew his spiritual sense, he suddenly perceived something moving on the other side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>He detected a silhouette but couldn't catch a clear view of it. One thing was for sure— it was a living being.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Wasting no time, Zheng sprinted towards the back of the mountain. When he looked around carefully, his eyes lit up. "Found you," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Eventually, a monster with two feet and a big eye came out of a small cave.</p>

  <p>It held a corpse of a tiny animal in its mouth and dragged it out.</p>

  <p>The little monster had keen senses that it immediately discovered Zheng floating in the air as soon Zheng saw it came out of the cave. It stared at him with its big eye for a few seconds and suddenly stamped its black, shiny feet on the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>Its pair of feet were powerful enough to jump from one mountain to another with ease.</p>

  <p>As he saw it with his own eyes, Zheng became more interested in the creature and began chasing it.</p>

  <p>He dashed as fast as he could and stayed closely behind the little monster.</p>

  <p>Its body was only the size of a palm, but its speed was fascinating as it easily leaped and shuttled among the debris.</p>

  <p>As Zheng chased it for five minutes, they had already traversed for thousands of miles. More and more debris floated and scattered as they dashed throughout the area.</p>

  <p>Zheng became aware that the piles of debris were constantly floating around forming messily into what looked like a three-dimensional city of scraps.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that Zheng's spiritual sense was firmly focused on the little monster, it might have fled from his sight.</p>

  <p>After another five minutes, the distance between Zheng and the creature became a lot closer. Realizing that it couldn't escape from Zheng, it suddenly entered through a broken house.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng set foot inside, a blue light flashed towards him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea what kind of light it was, but he knew that it contained strong energy.</p>

  <p>With his quick reflexes, he was able to flip his body. The light swept past Zheng's face, penetrated through the debris behind, and entered the boundless void.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng found a bloody wound as thick as a finger on his face.</p>

  <p>"How terrifying its power is!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked at what happened. He looked in the direction from which the light came and noticed another little monster that looked exactly the same as the one he was chasing before. As he stared into its big eye, he observed a blue afterglow in it.</p>

  <p>He concluded that the terrifying blue light was released by that little monster.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A blue dot started to appear in the little monster's eye again. At the same time, rays of blue light were seen on the surrounding debris as several little monsters began crawling out from it.</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo..." Zheng noticed the little monster he was chasing earlier among the nearby debris. It was making a strange laugh as it still held the cadaver of a small animal in its mouth.</p>

  <p>"Tch. So you think you've outsmarted me because you lured me into this trap?" Zheng's eyes narrowed as he talked to the creature.</p>

  <p>Actually, Zheng didn't have any ill-intent towards the little monster. He only wanted to learn more about this world so that he could find a way to leave.</p>

  <p>After all, the Chaotic Source World was in dire need of him as the Evil God was still hiding somewhere in the dark and observing covetously.</p>

  <p>He was a bit surprised that the little monster had the intention of killing him without even communicating with him.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The blue lights in the eyes of the little monsters exploded, shot out in different angles, and formed into what seemed like a fine fishing net.</p>

  <p>"You're being too naive if you think you can defeat me with such petty tricks."</p>

  <p>A cyan-colored feather suddenly emerged above Zheng's head, and he hastily shuttled through the huge net formed by the blue lights.</p>

  <p>Though the blue lights were extremely powerful, Zheng was able to move freely like a light leaf without being grazed.</p>

  <p>While continuously dodging, Zheng finally got to erase the gap between him and the original little monster. As it was caught off guard, Zheng quickly stretched out his arm and grabbed it.</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo, woo, woo..."</p>

  <p>Blue light shot out from the little monster's eye as it struggled from being captured by Zheng. The lights were powerful but the little monster itself was relatively weak as it couldn't do anything to break free from Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Seeing that their companion had been caught, the other little monsters grew restless. The blue light that shot out from their eyes became denser, more energy being released, and the huge net was almost airtight.</p>

  <p>Everything was crushed as the piercing rays ran through the surrounding debris.</p>

  <p>Zheng carried the little monster and moved up to a higher area. Just as his foot touched a piece of debris while escaping, the debris was suddenly pierced by the blue light and immediately turned to dust.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng noticed that a ray of blue light was reflected by a piece of metal plate about ten feet wide.</p>

  <p>'That metal plate can block the light! I might be able to make use of it.'</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Zheng quickly dashed towards the metal plate.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he got really close to the metal plate, an unexpected trap was actually waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Rays of blue light suddenly shot out from the metal plate, bounced back, and turned into fences. Soon, Zheng found out that he was entrapped inside.</p>
