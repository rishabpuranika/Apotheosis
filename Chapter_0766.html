<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 766 A Trap </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The "Light of Water" indeed looked weak. It looked like just a shield of water that would shatter at the slightest touch.</p>

  <p>The elder had used eighty percent of his strength to attack it with his spear.</p>

  <p>The spear of a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could pierce a mountain but not this enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"The attack was deflected and it spread across the entire enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>This enchanted barrier is really amazing. The person who created it must be really skillful!" exclaimed the elder.</p>

  <p>When his spear touched the enchanted barrier, it seemed as if there was a gentle force within the enchanted barrier that was diffusing the spear's power. The attack was, therefore, distributed through the entire enchanted barrier, and so it was able to survive it and not crack under pressure.</p>

  <p>In response, the other elders used all sorts of methods to attack the "Light of Water."</p>

  <p>Blades, swords, fists, spears...</p>

  <p>The elders each displayed their own unique techniques.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>There was a burst of color and a brilliant light as ripples appeared upon the Light of Water. From afar, it just looked like a gentle breeze was blowing on the sparkling lake causing the ripples on its surface.</p>

  <p>No matter how they attacked, the enchanted barrier remained intact.</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped, mouth agape, eyes wide open? unable to fathom the great power of the seemingly undamaged enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Several elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, too, tried to break the enchanted barrier but failed.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time that an enchanted barrier in the Central Region has blocked the attacks of more than six warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Even the sect-protecting array of the Ethereal Spirit Sect is incomparable to this one," mumbled an elder.</p>

  <p>"But even if it can block our attacks, does that mean it is powerful enough to impede Eddie's attacks?" asked another elder who was still worried.</p>

  <p>Even if the enchanted barrier could block the attacks of many warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it didn't mean it could also block Eddie's attacks for he was a warrior at the Life and Death Realm. Eddie had been through three life and death crises. His might was insurmountable.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a door to a thatched hut in a corner of the Cloud Hall rattled. It creaked as it opened.</p>

  <p>This small thatched hut was where Imogen had gone into seclusion. No one else could get close to the hut except Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Imogen trudged out of the thatched hut with her walking stick. Although it seemed like she moved at a slow pace, this wasn't really the case. In just a few steps, she appeared midair above the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Master." Ning Yudie glided towards Imogen when she saw her.</p>

  <p>The elders also respectfully bowed towards Imogen, who rarely made an appearance. Still, she was a pillar of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Imogen nodded and glanced at Luo Luo Zheng. In just a flash, she had reached the edge of the enchanted barrier with her walking stick pointing at the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Imogen's life vitality was already extremely restrained after she had reached her current level. Her attack seemed ordinary and weak but its power and potential were unmatched.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched in disbelief as they stared at Imogen's walking stick.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>When the walking stick touched the seemingly delicate enchanted barrier, the latter began to tremble violently. Huge ripples spread rapidly throughout the entire enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>A light flashed in Imogen's eyes. She gently retracted her stick and struck the enchanted barrier again.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>The surface of the enchanted barrier shook again as if it were struck by lightning. However, that was all that happened to it. Imogen's attack couldn't penetrate it any more than the elders' could.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Imogen let out a laugh. "Not bad! I just used all my strength, but it still wasn't enough. Maybe Luo Luo Zheng really is the lucky star of our Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>People with great luck usually had two states of fortune. Some people had exuberant luck, but, at the same time, they could also bring their luck to others around them and influence them too. The other state was where they had good luck and could devour and absorb the luck of those around them into their own bodies.</p>

  <p>These two states were also constantly changing as luck was mysterious and unpredictable.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Imogen was certain that Luo Luo Zheng was in the former state. His arrival would bring fortune to the Cloud Hall as well.</p>

  <p>Imogen already solidified Luo Zheng's reputation. The elders knew to never mess with him. Ning Yudie wasn't as protected. She was a sect leader and must be righteous. Anyone could easily pick a fight with her as long as it was done in a reasonable way.</p>

  <p>Having been the sect leader earlier, Imogen was the grand elder of the Cloud Hall. She was respected and no one dared to challenge her.</p>

  <p>No matter what happened, as long as the sect-protecting array was in place, the people of Cloud Hall could sleep safely at night.</p>

  <p>These days Eddie was like a huge shadow that shrouded the hearts of the Cloud Hall's members. Although they were not so sure whether the sect-protecting array would be able to block Eddie, the existence of the array still made them much more relieved.</p>

  <p>The entire Cloud Hall remained on high alert. They did not dare to lower their guard until Eddie arrived.</p>

  <p>However, three whole months had passed, but there was still no sign of Eddie. It was as if he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had returned to his normal life in the past few months and continued to immerse himself in cultivation. Within three months, he had once again raised his cultivation level by three grades.</p>

  <p>When he walked out of the cultivation chamber in the Cloud Hall, he was at the seventh grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Today, he had left his cultivation chamber because Ning Yudie summoned him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng arrived at Yudie's Ice Palace, she took out an invitation and tossed it to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at the invitation. It was issued by the World Commercial Alliance. They called all cultivators with enchanted lamps to light up their lamps during the Lantern Lighting Festival five days from now.</p>

  <p>"The Lantern Lighting Festival will be in five days, huh?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded in affirmation.</p>

  <p>Except Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie, nobody else knew that she had an enchanted lamp.</p>

  <p>It was a well-guarded secret.</p>

  <p>At the Martial Arts Contest, the leaders of the World Commercial Alliance had already brought this up. Perhaps the World Commercial Alliance was determined to enter Immortal Mist's celestial tomb in this year's Lantern Lighting Festival, so they sent out the invitations once more before the festival began.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to read the invitation, and his eyes suddenly lit up. On the invitation, there was a list of possible treasures that might exist in the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>This list was drawn up based on the inference of the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Whether this was really a presumption, or if the World Commercial Alliance had some fortuitous opportunity to learn about the celestial tomb, nobody would ever know.</p>

  <p>"Among the treasures listed on the invitation, the immortal's bone and the Netherworld Juncus are of no use to me. However, I must obtain one thing," said Ning Yudie, her eyes flashing greedily.</p>

  <p>The most important treasure on the invitation was the "Flower of Life and Death." These simple words were enough to make all the warriors in the Central Region go crazy.</p>

  <p>Whether someone was at the Illuminating Soul Realm or the Internal Elixir Realm, he would encounter a bottleneck in order to make a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>However, once he reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm, if he wanted to make a breakthrough, he would encounter a life and death crisis.</p>

  <p>Breaking through the Life and Death Realm required one to cross the life and death crisis, and many warriors died during this process. Moreover, even those warriors who had reached the Life and Death Realm had to constantly face life and death crises in order to raise their cultivation through great tribulations.</p>

  <p>Not only could the Flower of Life and Death help Ning Yudie to reach the level above the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it could also help Imogen to deal with her next life and death crisis. That was why Ning Yudie wanted to obtain the Flower of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, the immortal's bone is good for you. If you wish to cultivate the Transcendent Divine Might, you'd better get the bone. It will help you build the Eight Path Platforms," said the red dragon suddenly.</p>

  <p>"The immortal's bone?" Luo Zheng's eyes also lit up in anticipation, but he still voiced his doubts. "The treasures in the celestial tomb are tempting, but there's something wrong. Tia, don't you think it's strange?"</p>

  <p>"Strange?" Ning Yudie tilted her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"Immortal Mist was an immortal. He built the celestial tomb for himself.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, no one wants others to intrude into his tomb. However, why would the enchanted lamps appear in the world? And how did the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance know about these treasures?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was silent for a while, and then she said, "You mean it's a trap?"</p>

  <p>"It's just that it's possible," Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Rumor had it that once the enchanted lamps were all lit, those who had the lamps could enter the celestial tomb. This was rather weird. Who made these enchanted lamps? Why were the enchanted lamps spreading in the Central Region? It was a very strange thing to begin with.</p>

  <p>Actually, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the only one who suspected this. Several hundred years ago, people had suspected that the whole thing was a scam, or even a trap.</p>

  <p>But a warrior's life was filled with risks. It was plausible that the celestial tomb was a trap but even so, a lot of warriors would be flocking to the tomb to raid its treasures.</p>

  <p>While the two of them were discussing this matter, they felt a mighty pressure engulf the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The faces of Ning Yudie and Luo Luo Zheng suddenly changed.</p>
