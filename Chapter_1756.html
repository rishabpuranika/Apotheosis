<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1756 The Eruption Of The Malicious Aura </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The information in this blood was extremely vague and too difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely immersed in his thoughts when he began to hear a voice suddenly start to whisper in his ear.</p>

  <p>The voice was so soft that he had to try his best to make out the words as he also deciphered the information.</p>

  <p>Lone also came here a few days later. He was extremely pale and was already complaining as he arrived. "Why do I have to get my blood changed? I almost died!"</p>

  <p>He had not been born in a large clan. The only thing he trusted was his sword and he had no intention in going to the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was normal for him to be rude.</p>

  <p>All the other martial artists couldn't help but agree with him. The process of blood exchange was indeed painful and required an incredible amount of suffering.</p>

  <p>With the arrival of Lone, that only left Shania and Margaret.</p>

  <p>Zheng was quite looking forward to Margaret's arrival. However, he was also quite worried. He had received news of Yudie's ascension through searching the memories of the great world but he had no idea which supreme world she ascended to. Once he dealt with all his affairs, he would immediately set out to look for her.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current prestige, he knew it would be easy for him to find out where she ascended to. So long as the supreme world she managed to stay in belonged to one of the great forces of the human race, then Zheng was sure to find her.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could do now was to wait for Margaret's arrival and see what Master Feng's next move would be.</p>

  <p>However, all this waiting was making him bored.</p>

  <p>Nathan was the same. He spent his days finding a large enough rock to sleep on with his burly figure exposed.</p>

  <p>Lawson, on the other hand, was going a bit crazy. He would often seek Nathan out to tell him jokes. However, Nathan would already chase him away before he even got to the punchline.</p>

  <p>Tianming usually cultivated every day but he would find the time to chat with Zheng every now and then. He was probably the one who knew the truth amongst all of them but he kept his mouth shut whenever he felt he was about to talk about something important. These were secrets, and Zheng had no way of persuading him to reveal any of them.</p>

  <p>The most relaxed out of all of them was surely Lucille.</p>

  <p>She mostly spent her days reading in a comfortable corner, immersing herself in her fantasy books. If she got tired of reading, she'd look for Zheng and ask him to tell her some other stories.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng was never short of interesting tales courtesy of the great world's memories. It was easy for him to find a good story to tell her.</p>

  <p>As he narrated great tales of adventure to Lucille, his audience began to grow. At first, it was Tianming, and then Lone until even Kurt began to sit down and listen to him. "If this goes on, you'll have to pay money for the stories I tell you." He would often joke.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson were the only ones who showed disdain for Zheng's stories.</p>

  <p>They had been disgusted by him before and even more now.</p>

  <p>One day, just as Zheng was about to get to the highlight of the story, he saw an incomparably frightened expression appear on everyone's faces.</p>

  <p>This greatly confused him. He wasn't really telling them a horror story, so why were they frightened? Besides, his audience consisted of fearless warriors. They wouldn't be scared of a lame horror story.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, your skin..." Lucille said, pointing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He looked down on his hands and found that his skin had turned crimson! At the same time, he felt this kind of familiar restless feeling burst out from his being.</p>

  <p>The malicious aura had erupted!</p>

  <p>After entering the bottom of the Killing Sword Mountain, countless blood-colored spiders sent the malicious aura into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>According to Master Feng, the malicious aura he absorbed contained the secrets of the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Unfortunately, he still couldn't figure out any of these secrets.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, this malicious aura also contained a special type of poison that had an impact on a warrior's soul. The key to cultivating the Emotion Closing Godly Way was within this poison.</p>

  <p>As the malicious aura erupted, so did the poison as it surged upwards and into Zheng's mind!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes had turned a violent shade of red!</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Everyone quickly moved away from him.</p>

  <p>The strong malicious aura Zheng released could easily be regarded as killing intent. A cultivator who emanated such energy was often seen as a dangerous character.</p>

  <p>Those Godly Geniuses reacted very fast.</p>

  <p>Everyone kept their distance and stared at Zheng vigilantly in order to watch out for any of his attacks.</p>

  <p>He was the strongest out of all of them but there was no way he could defeat them if they came at him all at once. Nathan and Lawson stared at a distance and hoped that something bad would happen to him.</p>

  <p>"What's happening to him?" Lucille asked as she frowned.</p>

  <p>"Should we inform the Celestial Position members?" Lone asked.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is enveloped by malicious aura. It seems like the sin of killing is too heavy..." Kurt then put his hands together and started chanting the Rebirth Spell in an attempt to purify Zheng's aura.</p>

  <p>It was a mistake. The second he started chanting, Zheng suddenly rushed towards Kurt to attack.</p>

  <p>Any other warrior would've been sent running if they were chased by a red-eyed and red-skinned demon but Kurt remained an impassive wall of calm. As he stretched out his hand, a Buddhist hand immediately appeared next to Zheng and firmly held him in place.</p>

  <p>However, this move only bought Kurt a few seconds. Zheng fiercely struggled against the Buddhist hand and it was torn apart instantly!</p>

  <p>Kurt's calm cracked. "Zheng seems to have gone mad. Please help him..."</p>

  <p>Lucille quickly stepped in. With a flick of her slender fingers, the laws of the five elements surrounded Zheng and trapped him inside a net. Karl then clapped his hands and summoned a big, golden bell that crashed down towards their enraged ally.</p>

  <p>The others also made their moves. None of them wanted to hurt Zheng, only to hold him in place.</p>

  <p>Faced with the power of all these Godly Geniuses, Zheng was rendered, unable to break free. He was already unleashing his power but it proved to be in vain against everybody's powers.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the manic feeling in his heart gradually dispersed and his eyes regained their clarity. It was as if he woke up from an extremely strange dream. Zheng's face was understandably filled with bewilderment as he saw everyone looking at him as if he was a great enemy.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be influenced by your own malicious aura," Lucille said.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to be a bloodthirsty person so where did you get so much of it?"</p>

  <p>"When Xenia arrives, let her report on this matter," Karl said coldly. He had a strong sense of justice and did not really have a good impression of Zheng. He once even wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>"No need," Tianming said. "This is Zheng's cultivating way."</p>

  <p>"Cultivating way?" Lone repeated in confusion. "Zheng practices the cultivation method of malicious aura?"</p>

  <p>This kind of cultivation method was merely comprised of dangerous evil skills. It could be completed within a short period of time but it was impossible for it to be completed successfully since the collapse of a warrior was inevitable. Nobody who used this method was destined for attaining a higher cultivation level. In fact, a practitioner of this method could never hope to achieve even a quarter of what Zheng had already attained in this life. There was no way someone like Zheng used this kind of cultivation method.</p>

  <p>"It is just the cultivating way," Tianming repeated.</p>

  <p>Zheng remembered feeling restless but that was it. The situation confused him greatly. Could he perhaps take advantage of this feeling to cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way and activate the last lotus petal? It seemed impossible but both Tianming and Master Feng said so. There didn't seem to be any other choice for him since he also didn't seem to have the capability to expel the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>Only a day after that, Zheng's malicious aura burst out again and it was even more vicious this time. The warriors could only suppress him once more.</p>

  <p>It was quite a strange scene. One minute they'd be intently listening to Zheng's stories, but the next minute they'd be on guard against his sudden attacks.</p>

  <p>After six or seven days, the Celestial Position members finally arrived with Margaret.</p>

  <p>She looked extremely pale owing to having her blood changed. If she knew it was going to be that painful, then she would never have agreed to it. She only did it for the sake of reuniting with Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had just arrived when she saw a small crowd surrounding Zheng and attacking him. She immediately screamed and charged down in anger when she witnessed this scene.</p>
