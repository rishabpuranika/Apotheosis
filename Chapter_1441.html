<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the space for dodging became more and more limited, Zheng's gaze became incrementally more serious.</p>

  <p>Couldn't these Cannibal Moths be killed?</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had also clearly seen that the instant Deke and Finn rushed out, they had also activated their protective life vitality. At the same time, they circulated their life vitality which turned into a violent storm to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Even so, they were still unable to resist the Cannibal Moths and were still hard pressed. The strength of Deke and Finn was as nothing when compared to that of Luo Zheng, but they were still Spirit Supreme Realm masters.</p>

  <p>However, although there were some strange insects in the world, there should be some methods to restrain them�</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, these evil and strange insects tended to be afraid of thunder and lightning. As Luo Zheng brought Freya alongside to avoid the insects, he saw a lone Cannibal Moth floating slowly towards them from the darkness. Its tiny shape was ghostly in the darkened space.</p>

  <p>At this moment, an idea occurred to Luo Zheng. A ripple faintly appeared in the sea of chaotic energy within his body, as if he wanted to form a flash of lightning.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking too much; it's useless!" Xun spoke up at this moment.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the cyan dragon also cautioned, "The Thunder Law will have no effect on the Cannibal Moth. Moreover, the lightning that is produced by the Thunder Law will instead attract a greater number of Cannibal Moths!"</p>

  <p>Hearing their warnings, Luo Zheng suppressed the power that was going to erupt. No wonder Ab and the others hadn't used this method.</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?'' Luo Zheng asked with a frown as he looked at the phantasmal moths floating towards them with ravenous intent in their beady eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Just wait until the door of the underground palace is opened, then you can rush in," Xun advised. She had entered the underground palace before, but it had been one hundred thousand years ago, and at that time, there hadn't been any Cannibal Moths. If she had encountered those Cannibal Moths back then, she would have reminded Luo Zheng to be well prepared, and they wouldn't now have fallen into such a difficult situation.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Xun's words, Luo Zheng nodded his head slightly. He could only drag Freya along as he continuously paced back and forth to avoid the moths.</p>

  <p>However, as more and more tinkling sounds rang out, the number of Cannibal Moths that hatched out of the Nether Water also increased.</p>

  <p>Soon, there was almost no room remaining for them to dodge the clumsy insects.</p>

  <p>"Ahh�"</p>

  <p>Another blood-curdling screech rang out, and the sound of bones collapsing could be heard. It was likely that another person had been overwhelmed by the sheer number of the insects and had been devoured by the Cannibal Moths.</p>

  <p>Freya's heart thumped rapidly in fear. She didn't know how long they would be able to hold on in this desperate situation. Any second now, she would perhaps be devoured like the other people, with only skeletal remains left�</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed deeper. The densely packed Cannibal Moths had already completely sealed off the surrounding space, and there seemed to be no way out!</p>

  <p>"Up!''</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. The space in front of the underground palace was filled with Cannibal Moths. If he stayed here, he would die sooner or later. However, the number of Cannibal Moths was relatively smaller in the space around the Nine-head Snake sculpture.</p>

  <p>These Cannibal Moths floated in the air in large, swarming clusters.</p>

  <p>There was no way to figure out their pattern of movement. Luo Zheng stood where he was without moving at all. After half a second, he saw an empty space and immediately said, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>As a blast of power suddenly surged from his body, he immediately pulled Freya along and leapt into the air.</p>

  <p>Freya felt as though the sky and the earth were spinning as she was pulled through the air by the force coming from Zheng's hands. Then she landed on a snake head of the sculpture, next to Luo Zheng. However, it was pitch black and she couldn't even see her fingers in front of her face. She was dizzy and didn't know where she was right now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had jumped to stand on one of the other snake heads of the Nine-head Snake statue and they had temporarily avoided the hordes of Cannibal Moths. However, the people below were in serious trouble.</p>

  <p>In just a moment, they heard Ab's anguished shout, "Baal!"</p>

  <p>It seemed that another person had died�</p>

  <p>The situation below them was still not looking good as Luo Zheng watched vigilantly. The problem was that he had no way to deal with these Cannibal Moths. He could only wait for Lincoln to open the door to the underground palace. Luo Zheng was not good at waiting, when there were enemies to be slain.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, the clear sound of gears sliding through eons of rust rang out, filling the ears of everyone present with hope. After that, the entire Nine-head Snake statue began to rumble!</p>

  <p>"I made it!"</p>

  <p>From inside one of the snake's heads, Lincoln's voice rang out. It was likely that Lincoln had successfully opened the door to the underground palace!</p>

  <p>At the same time, several rays of incandescent light appeared in the space in front of the underground palace. These rays of incandescent light suddenly flickered through the darkened space.</p>

  <p>The entire area in front of the underground palace was illuminated as if it was daytime!</p>

  <p>Only under the blazing white light did Freya clearly see that the underground palace was covered with dense black dots that seemed almost to vibrate. And each black dot was a Cannibal Moth!</p>

  <p>She now knew that there should be a lot more Cannibal Moths around her. Luo Zheng had brought her all the way here safe and sound, so she had naturally taken it for granted that the number of Cannibal Moths was not too great. But now that she saw so many densely packed Cannibal Moths, she felt shocked. She couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng had managed to take her out from the space below while it was filled with so many Cannibal Moths. It seemed that Luo Zheng had run an impossible gauntlet of the creatures in the blinking of an eye. Or was it possible that he could see each of these Cannibal Moths?</p>

  <p>However, at present she didn't have much time to waste on thinking about such things�</p>

  <p>Zheng's attention wasn't focused on the Cannibal Moths. His eyes reflected the bright light, and he could feel the mysterious power of Space Law from this light!</p>

  <p>"This is�" Zheng's expression looked grim.</p>

  <p>"Someone is using the Grand Teleportation technique, and there's more than one of them!" Xun exclaimed, immediately solving Zheng's quandary.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Teleportation technique!"</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique could only be mastered when one comprehended at least five layers of the Space Law. Obviously, the strength of the people who were being teleported was not ordinary.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, from within the three flickering rays of bright light, many figures emerged one after another!</p>

  <p>"Demon Night members, ogres� And humans?" Luo Zheng instantly realized that these fellows had probably been waiting for the underground palace to open!</p>

  <p>The Cannibal Moths hated light very much. The Space Law had produced dazzling light. At this moment, all the Cannibal Moths pounced on those rays of light.</p>

  <p>However, the martial artists that had come out of the masses of light seemed to be completely prepared. All of them, be they Demon Night members or humans, held a thin yellow bamboo in their hands. From one end of the yellow bamboo came plumes of faint yellow smoke.</p>

  <p>The Cannibal Moths didn't fear the Law Power at all, but after coming into contact with the yellow smoke, they didn't have the slightest ability to resist. As the yellow smoke spiraled out, they fell from the sky one by one. In an instant, a large number of Cannibal Moths were killed!</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, the underground palace has truly opened. It must have been a hundred thousand years since the last time the underground palace opened. One hundred thousand years� Back then, I was just a kid!" The one who spoke was a human martial artist, and he was the Saint Lord of the Magnolia Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"A hundred thousand years ago, our queen has entered this underground palace. I wonder what benefits we will get this time?" a woman from the Demon Night asked calmly. This woman was the leader of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place. The Ginkgo Pavilion that Luo Zheng had once visited was affiliated to the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place. The queen which she mentioned was Xun.</p>

  <p>As for the one who led the ogres, he was the Saint Lord of the sacred place of the ogres�</p>

  <p>They had been observing the situation at the entrance of the underground palace the whole time. They did not care about the life or death of Luo Zheng and the seven brothers of the Hou family. To these leaders, life was cheap. However, the moment the door of the underground palace opened, they had brought the young elites from their sacred places and rushed over!</p>

  <p>The underground palace had previously repelled strong warriors with a high level of cultivation. The three leaders of the sacred places were all expectant world lords. If they rashly forced an entry into the underground palace, it would collapse and be ruined. Although the three powerful leaders couldn't enter, they could still send many of the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors in their sacred places into the underground palace in their stead.</p>

  <p>Ab had completely fallen into despair. Earlier, while still in the darkness, he had only been able to watch as his brothers died one by one, turning into piles of lifeless bones. He had not known for how long he could hold on, and when his six brothers had all died, a group of people suddenly appeared and easily killed those Cannibal Moths! He stood slack-jawed and stared at the newcomers in stunned amazement, while his emotions were in turmoil.</p>

  <p>Flames of fury then rushed into his mind. "You� " Why didn't you come earlier?"</p>

  <p>Normally, Ab would never speak so insolently to these powerful masters.</p>

  <p>However, when he looked at the piles of bones, which were all that was left of his brothers, the bitterness in his heart overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the ogres glanced coldly at Ab and sneered. He didn't even bother to speak to Ab or express his condolences. A Spirit Supreme Realm warrior was not in a position to question him. With a slight flash of his mountain-like body, a bloody light condensed at the tip of his finger. There was a mighty power contained within the blood light.</p>

  <p>Obviously, he was intent on killing Ab.</p>
