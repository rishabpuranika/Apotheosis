<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The amount of twists and turns perplexed these Other Shore creatures to the point that they almost went numb from the nervousness.</p>

  <p>Nobody tried to escape. All they could do was stare at the fox girl with glazed, frozen eyes.</p>

  <p>It was as if they were no longer concerned with whether she would kill them or not. Their fate had been sealed the moment they entered this trap.</p>

  <p>All they could do was accept their death with dignity.</p>

  <p>The fox girl turned her gaze to Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was her home turf so she had the upper hand but she still ended up defeated by this man. Was it a matter of luck, perhaps? Nevertheless, whether or not Zheng got lucky, she was still defeated which meant the brush-wielder had chosen the right person.</p>

  <p>She nodded at him pointedly. "You, come to me."</p>

  <p>Zheng had just recently restored the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body and was extremely on guard, however, her sudden command still caught him by surprise. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You've defeated me, so I will tell you something," she replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately shook his head. "I refuse!"</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was up with this fox girl, however, he knew for a fact that once he left the room and changed into a painting then the strength gap between the two of them would grow significantly. He would completely be at her mercy.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's vigilance, the fox girl was at a loss with how to persuade him.</p>

  <p>After a while, she decided to turn her attention towards the Other Shore creatures behind him. "You can leave the room now."</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was not willing to come to her, then she would have to empty out the room to privately converse with him.</p>

  <p>"We're not going anywhere..."</p>

  <p>"Those snakes are still guarding outside. If we go out, we're as good as dead!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! What he said!"</p>

  <p>It was only after looking at the determined expressions on their faces that the fox girl truly realized how much of a threat they viewed her as.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, she initially only planned to spare Zheng's life since he was the one who defeated her. However, she remembered the brush-wielder's words and knew it would be meaningless for her to kill these creatures.</p>

  <p>"You will leave here safely. I shall remove the Evil Orochis and ensure a safe path for you all," she assured them.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"You're truly going to let us go?"</p>

  <p>"You're not messing with us, right?"</p>

  <p>Of course, despite her assurance, they still found her words a bit too hard to believe.</p>

  <p>Having noticed that their suspicions remained unabated, the fox girl decided to send out a command to the Evil Orochis that told them to retreat from the upper-right corner of the No-break Maze.</p>

  <p>However, even if the two snakes had retreated far away, the creatures still refused to believe in her. There was no way they were going to trust someone with such large amounts of power.</p>

  <p>The fox girl gritted her teeth from irritation. "I'll give you ten seconds. If you don't leave then you leave me no choice but to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Fortunately for her, this ultimatum was enough to send the Other Shore creatures running. They all stepped past the hexagram array and turned into paintings as they left.</p>

  <p>Before Egan and Kirk left, they shot one last look at Zheng, wishing him luck for whatever the fox girl had in store for him.</p>

  <p>She didn't seem to have any more intentions of killing anyone but they weren't sure what she wanted from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once everyone left and they were finally alone, the fox girl talked to Zheng directly. "You've obtained a total of eighteen imprints in the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with full honesty.</p>

  <p>There was no need for him to hide anything or lie since she was already forthright with her question.</p>

  <p>She smiled and asked another question. "What kind of bloodline do you want to obtain?"</p>

  <p>The specificity of her question made Zheng freeze.</p>

  <p>According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the most difficult part of the Eternal Scroll Painting lay on the third page which was a huge vortex wherein Zheng could fully test his own strength.</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, the imprints he had collected could be used to help him explore the vortex. The fox girl's question just now sounded like she was offering Zheng whatever bloodline he wanted. Was it really that easy?</p>

  <p>"Ever since I entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, I have strived to achieve a lot of things. The bloodline I will obtain will just depend on my fate, right?" he replied after thinking about it for a while.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "Man proposes, God disposes," and Zheng believed this wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>"I want you to go to the end," the fox girl said with a very serious look.</p>

  <p>"The end?" Zheng repeated with a scoff of disbelief. "There are so many elder masters who've entered the Eternal Scroll Painting before me. I'm not sure I'm worthy enough of surpassing them and making it to the end."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was almost entirely under the control of the Element Spirit race which was already composed of countless elites. To surpass them all would be an incredibly difficult task for Zheng. It wasn't a feat he had that much confidence in achieving at the moment.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's eyes glinted with a hint of annoyance. "I wasn't asking you to surpass those losers. I said I wanted you to go to the end. Do you understand me?" she huffed. "Those guys you mentioned just got the root-level bloodline. That's nowhere near enough!"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow at the term she just used. "Root-level bloodline?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was quick to rush to his aid. "I've never really heard of this term before. Perhaps it's a definition set for grading bloodlines. We usually separate the large vortex of the Eternal Scroll Painting into the inner and outer circles. The innermost circle has all the best bloodlines. Anyway, let's just hear her out first."</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that the fox girl no longer held any hostility toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bloodlines in that world are divided into three levels with the weakest being the ordinary source-level bloodline. All bloodlines in the sixteen outer circles of the vortex are all on ordinary source level while those in the four inner circles are on root level," she explained.</p>

  <p>"That's quite similar to our grading methods!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "There are sixteen outer circles and four inner circles. The inner ones naturally have better bloodlines than the outer ones."</p>

  <p>Chiyou, Houyi, and a vast majority of Eternal Realm warriors obtained ordinary source-level bloodlines in outer circles. Only a small number of people managed to obtain bloodlines in inner circles.</p>

  <p>This explanation clarified some things for Zheng. However, there was still something that bothered him. "You mean to tell me that it isn't enough to obtain a root-level bloodline?" he asked.</p>

  <p>A root-level bloodline was at the same level as those powerful masters in Stage Thirty-three. Shouldn't that already be enough? It didn't seem to be enough judging from what the fox girl just told him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words immediately filled her eyes with disappointment. "If you came to the Eternal Scroll Painting only to obtain a root-level bloodline then I'll just end your life right now!"</p>

  <p>The fox girl raised her hand. Her thumb and index fingers were clasped together and the moment she snapped, Zheng would instantly die.</p>

  <p>She employed the use of a unique Law Power within this channel, a theurgy bestowed upon her by the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but secretly roll his eyes at her dramatics. He truly hadn't met a more unreasonable person but since he knew that she was serious about killing him, he had to submit. He immediately held up his hands in surrender. "Wait! I'll try my best to meet your requirement. If you say that the root-level bloodline is not enough then what's stronger than that?"</p>

  <p>"The origin-level bloodline," she told him, finally stretching out her hands.</p>

  <p>"There are four kinds of origin-level bloodline inside the room at the very end. You have to get one of them. If you can't then I'll kill you."</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth twitched when he looked at her solemn expression. How did things come to this? Now he wasn't even allowed to get an ordinary bloodline, no, he had to get one of those so-called origin-level bloodlines or risk death.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>As far as he recalled, the bloodlines in the inner circles were the most powerful. So long as Zheng obtained one of them then he would be qualified to establish a force in Stage Thirty-two or Thirty-three and guarantee the survival of their race.</p>

  <p>However, according to the fox girl, there were actually far stronger bloodlines. It was something he had never heard of before.</p>
