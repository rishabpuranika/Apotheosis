<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2110 Disintegration </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before opening the enchanted barrier, Luo Zheng went to the weapon refining workshop and took Livingston from the fairy palace, permitting him to stay temporarily in the Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Livingston was not pleased to be disturbed by Luo Zheng. He had been busy forging weapons in the weapon refining workshop day and night, but now his work had been interrupted by Luo Zheng. He naturally found the situation unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did in that way as a precaution.</p>

  <p>The secondary creature would be disintegrated upon entering the divine land, and if Livingston entered the divine land as a puppet, that would probably not be much better.</p>

  <p>It could be said that all the materials from the universe would disintegrate after they were brought into the divine land...</p>

  <p>If the enchanted barrier was removed, then the power within the divine land could potentially disintegrate his metal body and soul.</p>

  <p>After chasing Livingston away, Luo Zheng returned once more to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Following to Saul's instructions, he neatly placed the eight tokens together.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng activated these tokens one after the other, the eight tokens seemed to come to life. At first they circled in the air for a while before finally settling themselves in their own order!</p>

  <p>The sequence of the eight tokens was heaven, earth, thunder, wind, water, fire, mountain, and valley.</p>

  <p>The tokens connected together in the air and formed themselves into a ring. A black and white light began to shine out from the ring. These were the Dark and Light energies that Luo Zheng had encountered on the True Path. The Dark and Light energies circled and fused together, eventually turning into the perfect Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams floated slowly in front of Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>"Put in your hand..." Saul instructed.</p>

  <p>Not far away, when Master Evil and Wayne saw the scene which unfolded, their eyes betrayed their greed and desire.</p>

  <p>Being able to control the Eight Diagrams meant that one could exercise complete control over the whole fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The fairy palace had been left behind by Bromley. They might not know about all the secrets and resources within the walls, but the dungeon that had trapped them for countless years had left an indelible impression upon them. Therefore they assumed that the rest of the fairy palace must be equally magical.</p>

  <p>However, their greedy expressions only lasted for an instant before fading away.</p>

  <p>After all, there was a chance that they might not be able get the approval of the Eight Diagrams. On top of that, they had sworn an inner demon oath in front of Luo Zheng before, and if they broke it, it would cast a shadow over their future lives. Moreover, Bromley was not Mike, and was not yet dead. If he came back to attack at any point, then even if they occupied the fairy palace, they would not be able to resist him in a fight... At that point they would simply be courting death.</p>

  <p>Assuming that they would soon be able to ascend, they restrained the greed that was growing in their hearts.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng extended his hand into the Eight Diagrams, the Eight Diagrams started to revolve slowly around his arm. The eight tokens kept spiraling upwards all the way along his arm, until they finally reached Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>From a distance, Luo Zheng appeared to be wearing a strange hat.</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards, the Eight Diagrams and tokens began to dissipate, fusing into Zheng's mind and fusing with his soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was experiencing mixed emotions and he began to sigh. Many things had stayed in his mind before. The nine Genuine Dragons and Xun had already left his brain, but the Evolutionary Divine Arts and the Infinity Ruler with unknown uses appeared clearly in his mind. Now, the Eight Diagrams had also drilled deep into his mind...</p>

  <p>After the Eight Diagrams melded into his soul, Luo Zheng suddenly felt as if his soul was connected to the fairy palace. Everything in the fairy palace seemed to have life just like his arms and legs. With just a thought, he could now open any door in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"These arrays...</p>

  <p>Soaring Dragon Array, Triple Elements Array, Divine Scorpion Array..."</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng finally sensed the existence of several powerful restrictions and arrays within the fairy palace. These restrictions and arrays were all carefully concealed. Luo Zheng had not noticed them in the past as his movement range had been limited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to freely control the arrays and restrictions, which raised new questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>Only a small portion of the arrays and restrictions in the fairy palace were intended to defend against attacks from outside enemies, and the majority of them were aimed towards the inside of the fairy palace, to be more precise, into the depths of the ground under the fairy palace!</p>

  <p>When he came to this realization, a perplexed expression settled across Zheng's face once more.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, were there some extraordinary surprises hidden far below the fairy palace?</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can't you work faster?" Master Evil complained.</p>

  <p>"If there's a problem, we can discuss it later. Can't you let us out of here first?"</p>

  <p>Wayne begged.</p>

  <p>When he heard their words, Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. He would have liked to ask Saul about it, but he thought that the things hidden far below the fairy palace were probably too serious for him to mention in front of Master Evil and Wayne. He chose to restrain his curiosity and simply replied, "Alright, I'll let you out now!"</p>

  <p>By opening the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace, Luo Zheng knew that he had truly stepped into the divine land!</p>

  <p>However, Master Evil was right. Just as he had said, the Swirl Forest was indeed an exceptionally powerful forbidden area. Even with all of their strength, they still needed to be careful. It was quite possible that a lack of care and attention could result in their death. Luo Zheng obviously could not pass through the Swirl Forest to get to the divine land.</p>

  <p>When he reached the point of actually opening the enchanted barrier, Luo Zheng couldn't deny that he was still a little nervous.</p>

  <p>When he first left the Lower World and ascended to the Upper World, the disorderly vitality which existed between heaven and earth had made him feel quite uncomfortable. This divine land was a 'true world' to the secondary creatures. He had no idea what sorts of pressure it would bring to bear on him.</p>

  <p>"Act quickly..." Wayne urged him again noticing that Luo Zheng was still not moving.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just nodded and shut his eyes.</p>

  <p>As for the pink enchanted barrier which was set to guard the fairy palace, Bromley named it the bubble enchanted barrier. The space within the enchanted barrier could transform into the space of the divine land, or into the space of the universe, or even into a passageway between two spaces...</p>

  <p>To possess the ability to establish such an enchanted barrier meant that Bromley was indeed a rare talent. Although the bubble enchanted barrier did not possess a large range, it was equivalent to a miniature universe!</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The pink bubble enchanted barrier, which covered the fairy palace, quivered like a huge soap bubble before suddenly bursting...</p>

  <p>The moment the crack appeared, Zheng's eyes flashed. This was the first time he had felt the Mu Ning of the divine land, yet he couldn't detect anything special or any unusual feeling. It was as if the divine land was ordinary.</p>

  <p>Then, in the blink of an eye, he felt something strange from his fingers!</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Cracks were now appearing on his space ring. The ring suddenly shattered and it jumped free of Zheng's hand. At the same time, a vast expanse of white mist had begun to emerge from the ring!</p>

  <p>This space ring was actually starting to disintegrate on its own!</p>

  <p>"This is bad. When I brought this space ring I forgot that it also comes from the universe!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was now too late to correct his mistake. The space ring rapidly turned into a mass of white mist that scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>And as the space ring disintegrated, an even more bizarre scene started to unfold.</p>

  <p>Normally, if a space ring was damaged, the space within would collapse and it became impossible to find the things hidden within it. When that happened the things that were hidden within the Sumeru Space would be lost forever.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, when the space ring had broken apart, the space in the space ring that was brought over from the universe didn't collapse, but instead disintegrated along with the space ring. Thus the things that were inside the space ring shot out in an instant.</p>

  <p>Fairy weapons, sacred weapons, sabers, swords, bows, and other weapons of the various ranks were all squeezed from the disintegrated space and sprinkled onto the ground before Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng had acted cautiously earlier and had placed some important items within the Breaking Cloud World, rather than brought them with him into the fairy palace. Thus the items stored in this space ring were not especially valuable.</p>

  <p>Cracks also began to appear on the surface of the sabers and swords.</p>

  <p>White mist continued to billow out before disappearing in front of Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>The only items that did not vanish were the Great Weighty Sword and the Great Weighty Sword's scabbard that Luo Zheng had in his possession. They were spared because they were made by Livingston from materials taken from the fairy palace, and these materials originated in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Noting that the enchanted barrier had now disappeared, Master Evil and Wayne could not disguise their joy.</p>

  <p>They clapped their hands together to thank Luo Zheng, and then while laughing got ready to leave.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment, please," Luo Zheng suddenly said.</p>
