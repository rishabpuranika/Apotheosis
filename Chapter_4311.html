<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4311 Infinite Seals </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Wait... What?"</p>

  <p>The downgrader's six pairs of eyes flashed sharply, as though something sparked inside them.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling that could only be likened to confusion consumed him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey covered his broken arm with his other hand, and he too felt strange.</p>

  <p>Although he had unleashed one hundred percent of his strength in each punch, he never expected he'd be able to defeat the downgrader.</p>

  <p>He had been under the impression that even if he did go all out, he wouldn't be able to break down even the most basic defenses of the downgrader, let alone beat him like this!</p>

  <p>"You, you...! What have you done?" the downgrader growled and took one staggering step towards Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>The surface of his body was riddled with black ink marks as more and more cracks appeared. Gradually, his skin began to flake off his body.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do anything," Geoffrey said confusedly, taking a cautious step back. "I just punched you."</p>

  <p>Yan, Mike, Tianming and the others, who had been watching from behind Geoffrey, were all rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess eyed the downgrader warily. Raising her thin eyebrows gently, she suddenly had some sort of a premonition. Whipping her head around, as expected, she saw a faint figure quietly materializing.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The downgrader also sensed Luo Zheng. Now, he didn't feel that overwhelmed, but he still felt the need to ask, "How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"It seems you don't know everything about the Extreme Form energies.</p>

  <p>You don't even know the power of crystal solution." A faint smile crept on Luo Zheng's face. "Since I couldn't defeat you, I had to turn myself into a poisonous pill for you to swallow."</p>

  <p>Then, it dawned on the downgrader. "The power of the crystal solution?" he echoed softly, as though in a daze. "I see..."</p>

  <p>It was a kind of poisonous energy formed by combining several Extreme Form energies. While it was lethal as a weapon, it was difficult to use.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had wanted to devour the ancestry-level bloodline, which gave Luo Zheng a chance to deliver the fatal blow.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The downgrader chuckled helplessly as his body disintegrated little by little. Fragments were falling from his body in bite-sized chunks, yet he still continued to laugh like a madman. "Killing me has earned you great honor. But is it enough to defeat me?"</p>

  <p>With the help of the Source Light, the downgrader would be able to revive infinitely. It didn't matter if he was killed.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have known if I didn't try." With that, Luo Zheng abruptly moved to the side of the black light.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had made it very clear that the Source Light could not be damaged, and even went so far as to put it out in the open.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng studied the black light and began to search the memories given to him by Clarence.</p>

  <p>Clarence didn't tell Luo Zheng how to restrict the downgrader, but the memories revealed all sorts of information on how to use all the Extreme Form energies. Thus, Luo Zheng figured that the methods of restriction must be hidden within them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes at the Source Light and immense amounts of Extreme Form energies started to gush out of his body.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Extreme Form energies of three different colors overlapped, forming a massive circular altar.</p>

  <p>The circular altar then shrank quickly and enveloped the black light tightly.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Seal!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know which the best seal was, so he decided to use the stupidest method first. Eventually, he planned to use all the methods that were designed to seal something within.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Countless green crystals flowed into the void. Once they surrounded the circular altar, they joined together to form one huge emerald crystal.</p>

  <p>"The Life Seal!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A square space bigger than the first one wrapped around the emerald gem and then turned into a stable space.</p>

  <p>"The Space Seal!"</p>

  <p>"The Heaven Lock, seal!"</p>

  <p>"The Phase Enchanted Barrier, seal!"</p>

  <p>"The Evil Will, seal!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Although the types of Extreme Form energies were much fewer than those of the bloodline powers, their combinations were also very rich. The theurgies that evolved from them were strange, birthing more sorts of powerful sealing methods.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't even stop to think. He relentlessly used all the theurgies that had restricting effects.</p>

  <p>Ten layers.</p>

  <p>Twenty layers.</p>

  <p>Thirty layers.</p>

  <p>From within the black light, the dead downgrader gradually came back to life.</p>

  <p>His hand slowly stretched out from the black light, only to be met by the first seal.</p>

  <p>"Humph! It's only the Holy Seal. What a childish method!"</p>

  <p>With a careless flick of his wrist, Extreme Form energy appeared in his hand. Without hesitation, he smashed the Holy Seal.</p>

  <p>The circular altar instantly shattered into pieces with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Just as the downgrader was about to emerge from the black light completely, he found that there was another layer that sealed him within.</p>

  <p>"The Life Seal? Psh!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The emerald green gem was smashed into pieces with a single punch.</p>

  <p>"The Space Seal? Break!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The square space then collapsed, inch by inch.</p>

  <p>However, even after destroying three layers of seals, the downgrader was met by yet another seal.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Another seal!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader couldn't help but curse. He really didn't expect that Luo Zheng would use so many seals. How bothersome!</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no clue that Luo Zheng had actually set up over a hundred layers of seals from the outside, and there were no signs of him stopping.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the chaos, a hush had fallen over the huge square platform.</p>

  <p>But if one were to activate his spiritual sense, he would be met with countless other spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>On the square platform, two billion brains were working seamlessly, like a well-oiled machine.</p>

  <p>The real Evil God floated from above. After all the information had been filtered, he absorbed the most useful ones.</p>

  <p>"There are eighty-six kinds of 'Field' energy in the sixth-grade world."</p>

  <p>"There are forty-five kinds of 'Weight' energy in the seventh-grade world."</p>

  <p>"There are twenty-two kinds of 'Coupling' energy in the eighth-grade world."</p>

  <p>"In the ninth-grade world..."</p>

  <p>The two billion brains were quickly speculating and summarizing. It was surprisingly efficient to communicate with each other with spiritual senses, and it was not as noisy and chaotic as before.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, eighty-six kinds of "Field" energy had been completely displayed in front of the Evil God. He absorbed this information easily. The forty-five kinds of "Weight" energy and twenty-two kinds of "Coupling" energy, which were the energy forms in the high-grade worlds were all understood by him.</p>

  <p>The higher the level of the energy, the more difficult it would become for the Evil God to control it.</p>

  <p>While he could use the "Field" energy, this method consumed a lot of energy.</p>

  <p>However, the consumption of the "Weight" energy was even more astronomical. The Evil God was curious and tried to summon it, but when half of the energy was condensed, his remaining energy had been consumed by a tenth.</p>

  <p>He still needed to maintain the operation of two billion brains. How could he be willing to waste all his energy on this? These two billion brains were like two billion cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm, which consumed a considerable amount of energy.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't find the source of infinite energy before their current supply of energy was exhausted, the Evil God would lose without a fight.</p>

  <p>As for the Coupling energy, although he had found the way, he didn't have the courage to try it. This was something that even he couldn't touch.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the energy was restored was very fast, basically up to the expectations of the Evil God. After all, by now he had already mastered the rules of restoring.</p>

  <p>However, he was still pessimistic about the matter.</p>

  <p>He could hear nothing stirring within the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Because they were in different primitive lands, he was unable to find out the situation in the Burial Land through his omniscient power. However, this was definitely not a good omen. Once the winner was decided, he would be the next goal.</p>
