  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every single time the three-eyed boy returned, he would carry along with him some Burning Crystals.</p>

  <p>If there happened to be too many Burning Crystals, he would stuff them into the huts below. But if there were not many Burning Crystals, he would toss them directly to Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, the three-eyed boy was indifferent to Zheng and Feng Ge. But eventually, after they got to see each other more often, he grew more comfortable and friendly with them.</p>

  <p>Once, the three-eyed boy even brought back a small mountain of Burning Crystals and took out a small black toad. As the toad was revealed to light, its body began to emit traces of black light.</p>

  <p>He handed this toad to Feng Ge as a gift.</p>

  <p>With a nasty glimpse at the dark strange creature, Feng Ge, of course, was in no way going to accept this.</p>

  <p>Just then, the three-eyed boy directly threw the toad to her. The moment it came into contact with her, it seeped into her soul. Then, Feng Ge felt that her soul force began to surge. It turned out that the black toad was actually more effective than soul crystal itself.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was in shock. The three-eyed boy scoffed coldly and walked away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng continued to study the properties of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Every time the mission of making candles was completed, Zheng squatted outside the hut and sat at the junction of candle light and darkness, trying to understand the properties of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>He took down some pieces of wood from the corner of the hut, carefully placing them in and out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the wood sticks remained unchanged.</p>

  <p>In addition to this experiment, Zheng also poked candles into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Still, when he took them back, the candles didn't alter in any way.</p>

  <p>"It should be because of the energy!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Like candles, the wood sticks from the hut didn't possess any energy fluctuation. The materials that didn't contain energy fluctuation or the Other Shore Power could freely go in and out of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Sands, stones, the Souls of Light, and corporeal bodies on the Other Shore all contained some level of energy. If these things fell into the Dark Region, something would definitely occur to them.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!" Zheng called out, excited.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge walked over with an unwilling expression on her face, but she still took out an Other Shore Token from her space ring.</p>

  <p>Zheng's corporeal body could not carry the Sumeru Space, so he could only study with Feng Ge's things.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token Feng Ge took out was an ancient sword, which was said to have been found and retrieved from Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>With great caution, Zheng held the ancient sword in his hand and slipped its tip into the darkness.</p>

  <p>He had no clue what was occurring in the darkness, but he definitely felt the energy fluctuations from it. When Zheng pulled the sword back, the sword tip was missing, as if it had been trimmed off by the darkness.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, the faces of Feng Ge and Zheng changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>They remembered that when they crossed the wooden bridge behind the Grand Sky Temple, many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace fell into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Although they knew what happened to them? death, they never thought that the Dark Region was so cruel to living beings in the light.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the front end of the ancient sword and thought for a while.</p>

  <p>Then he suddenly thrust the sword into the darkness and struck the ground.</p>

  <p>Before the sword disappeared completely, Zheng began to press it down as he pried some type of substance from the ground into the light.</p>

  <p>It was only black soil, but under the candlelight, it melted like the snow in summertime as it released its energy.</p>

  <p>"The light and darkness are as incompatible as fire and water...</p>

  <p>In theory, if we enter the Dark Region, we would just meet our own deaths.</p>

  <p>In the same way, the creatures in the Dark Region, like the three-eyed boy, the red python and the human-monkey monsters, should then die once exposed to the light of the candle." Zheng was tremendously dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"But they didn't. What keeps them unharmed by candlelight? And can we use such things too?"</p>

  <p>As long as he was free, Zheng would spare no time to do anything else except study.</p>

  <p>However, Feng Ge was not very interested in such things. All she could do was to support him in any way that she could.</p>

  <p>In fact, Feng Ge wanted to chat with him about the Phoenix Palace and her three disciples. But whenever she asked Zheng where he came from, the man responded with silence. She eventually learned to just let go of the topic for good.</p>

  <p>However, the more Zheng refused to tell her, the more curious she became.</p>

  <p>She had made up her mind that if she could survive this time, she would have to interrogate the three disciples when she returned to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>The three-eyed boy already knew that Zheng and Feng Ge were trying their best to escape, but he never attempted to stop them.</p>

  <p>Because they were confined to the small hut, their resources proved to be limited and were simply not enough to allow them to enter the Dark Region. In some sense, the Dark Region held them like prisoners.</p>

  <p>"This is for you!"</p>

  <p>When the three-eyed boy returned this time, he threw a handful of green fruits right towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng took the fruits, and stuffed them into his mouth, as if he was famished.</p>

  <p>Not long after he swallowed them, he felt like his internal organs began to burn within him. The fruits that grew from the Dark Region continuously released energy, and the energy had directly turned into Zheng's physical strength.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical strength increased very slowly, but surely. Compared to the Other Shore Power that came from the Other Shore Token, his physical strength was meager.</p>

  <p>However, with the help of the fruits, his strength increased rapidly which took him by surprise.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's surprised expression, the three-eyed boy was a bit proud.</p>

  <p>He said, "Work hard here, and you will benefit in the future."</p>

  <p>Although the three-eyed boy seemed to have ice in his veins, he was quite generous to them. There were great treasures everywhere in the Dark Region, all of great value.</p>

  <p>Days passed and they were almost weary.</p>

  <p>There was no difference in day and night on the Other Shore. But Zheng thought ahead, and he made sure to keep an accurate record of it from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>He and Feng Ge had been in the candle workshop for three months, and they had made about a thousand candles.</p>

  <p>In desperation, Feng Ge repeatedly hinted towards Zheng that after the three-eyed boy and the giant ape had left, they would just light candles and escape.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had been a bit hesitant about this idea. If the three-eyed boy had been monitoring them or had set traps in the surroundings, they would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>There was only one chance for them to escape, and Zheng must remain extremely cautious to ever succeed.</p>

  <p>It was the first week of the fourth month, and Zheng and Feng Ge were hard at work to make wax.</p>

  <p>Just then, they began to feel the ground shake. With a quick glance at each other, they wondered why the boy had returned so soon.</p>

  <p>As they approached the door, they were met once again with the huge hairy hand stretching out from the darkness. Dark red blood began falling from it, like a red rain. Because the blood belonged to the Dark Region, it released energy and quickly disappeared when the light from the candle met with it.</p>

  <p>"Whose blood is it?" Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The giant ape's hand unfurled after landing on the ground, and Zheng and Feng Ge let out a large gasp. The three-eyed boy was lying in the palm of its hand, drenched in goopy blood. His skin was bitten by probably numerous monsters. Zheng and Feng Ge had no idea whether he was dead or alive at this point.</p>
