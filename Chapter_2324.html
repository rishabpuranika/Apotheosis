<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Blood Breaking Bite!</p>

  <p>As Nelly witnessed this, her eyes suddenly widened. She stared at Zheng trying to catch her breath as she gradually calmed down.</p>

  <p>Although she had highly suspected Zheng's identity after hearing Rachelle's analysis, she now was sure of it after seeing Zheng employ the Blood Breaking Bite.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you..." Nelly murmured.</p>

  <p>When she was defeated by the anonymous man in the Arena of Legends, she found herself extremely angry. It came to a point where she even locked herself in her room for an entire day. Her strong and proud personality did not allow her to be defeated, let alone to be defeated by a mere proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>At this point, she even didn't care if the anonymous man would join the Dongfang Clan or not.</p>

  <p>Her ultimate goal was to find out his identity, and challenge him once again. This thought was something she couldn't let go. She was full of the desire to know and learn everything about the powerful warrior before her.</p>

  <p>She was determined that her target was going to be no other than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nelly thought that her sister, Rachelle, shared the same ideas, but she did not know that Rachelle had also confirmed the other identity of the anonymous man. All she wanted to do was to find out the anonymous man and kill him.</p>

  <p>"What? Is that the Blood Breaking Bite of Murphy?!"</p>

  <p>"How did he learn it?"</p>

  <p>"What a pity... Nathaniel lost so much blood."</p>

  <p>Many True Gods who were there immediately recognized the Blood Breaking Bite which was a kind of theurgy beyond way. Some also gave looks of confusion towards Nelly.</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Beings outside of the forbidden land also had a strange expression on their faces. Zheng's cultivation was so confusing to most because the Blood Breaking Bite was derived from the Murdering Godly Way and was also the secret theurgy beyond way in the Mu Clan. How did Zheng use such?</p>

  <p>Nicholas, on the other hand, remained indifferent and silent. It was not so easy for anyone to defeat the disciple of the Dongfang Clan. Besides, Nathaniel's cultivation base already exceeded Zheng's by one crucial level.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel stood still as his face flushed into a pale white; he could feel weakness in his body. He clapped his hands, and a small red pill appeared in his hand. With a flick of his finger, the pill shot into his throat and he swallowed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Once the pill dissolved, a strong power of blood and vital energy was released throughout him. Just then, his face began to regain color as if the pill had healed him.</p>

  <p>The pill that he had swallowed was renowned as the "Green Blood Pill", a kind of six times refined pill. It could instantly replenish the lack of power of blood and vital energy of anyone who ingested it.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, his face looked a little bit too red and unhealthy because too much blood and vitality had been replenished.</p>

  <p>"I always thought you were a member of the Han Clan," he shouted.</p>

  <p>"The Mu Clan though? I wouldn't have guessed."</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan reigned among the alliance of rich clans on the Floating Islands. On the whole, it wouldn't aim at any clan belonging to the alliance. Because of this, Nathaniel made it a point to keep a good relationship with Langston and Nelly. However, if Zheng really came from the Mu Clan, why didn't they tell him that in the beginning?</p>

  <p>Many of Zheng's powers were kept hidden, too. The fact that Zheng absorbed his opponents' internal momentum with the identity of an anonymous man didn't spread. Nelly also did not tell others about this matter for her own personal reasons.</p>

  <p>As Nathaniel guessed such things, he became angry and it showed in his grim, disgusted expression.</p>

  <p>"He is not a member of the Mu Clan. He is from the Han Clan, and he is the anonymous man! As for the Blood Breaking Bite that he has mastered, he learned it from me as we fought!" Nelly shouted.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>There were still a handful of True Gods in the valley who didn't bother or care about what was happening. To them, it was enough that they beat the rest of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions into pieces and obtained some divine might coins to get them by.</p>

  <p>Now, most of the True Gods turned to get a good look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Except for Liusu, Kelsey and Aleyna, other True Gods were surprised because they had no clue about his identity.</p>

  <p>"I recall that the anonymous man is supposed to be a proving godly warrior. But this guy is a low-rank True God..."</p>

  <p>"He must have broken through to the higher cultivation level after the re-ranking of the Floating Islands. This explains his extraordinary strength!</p>

  <p>When he was a mere proving godly warrior, he even defeated Nelly.</p>

  <p>With his current cultivation base, there is no doubt that he can confidently go against Nathaniel!"</p>

  <p>"Where did he come from? What is his background? Wow, there are indeed many remarkable talents among the youth of the Han Clan... Can someone please explain how this clan can cultivate such a formidable talented warrior?"</p>

  <p>On and on the True Gods whispered and rambled among themselves, trying to find answers to questions that seemed to have no end.</p>

  <p>Outside of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, the Holy Beings began to look at Zheng with interest again.</p>

  <p>"So he's the anonymous man. Aha!," Clark exclaimed. "Samuel, your Han Clan is quite blessed to have such a talented warrior on your side. If it weren't for him, your clan would have dropped out of the top ten in the ranking list days ago." He then laughed.</p>

  <p>Before the Floating Islands' points were counted up, Liusu was suddenly able to obtain about two million more points. She shifted the whole ranking of the Floating Islands!</p>

  <p>However, no one was dumb. Everyone knew that the anonymous man didn't want to expose his identity, so he deliberately lost to Liusu. For sure, the anonymous man must have come from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Samuel also stared at Zheng and said, "He is from our Han Clan's ancestral land, but I am quite certain that he is not a direct descendant of the clan."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Clark gasped in surprise. "How did the True God from an unknown clan reach this level? This is even more surprising!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas's eyes flashed, he opened his mouth to speak but hesitated. Samuel beat him to it and said, "Holy Nicholas, I have heard that the Dongfang Clan seems to have some interest in the anonymous man and wants to recruit him to the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island. I didn't know the identity of the anonymous man before, and now I know clearly about that. If you will accept him, this warrior should be honored nonetheless."</p>

  <p>Many Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings who were there were puzzled at Samuel's comment, and even felt a hint of disdain for him.</p>

  <p>Rich clans on the Floating Islands always attached great importance to talents in their own clans.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that a warrior like the anonymous man was indeed a rare talent.</p>

  <p>Samuel wanted to give the same talent to others even though it was not easy for the Han Clan to have such a talent. It seemed that he intended to use the anonymous man to please Nicholas. As a Holy Being who ruled a universe, he too was a crafty and reckless fellow.</p>

  <p>With a hint of rage in her eyes, Joy bit her lips and felt humiliated.</p>

  <p>Although she knew from the very beginning that Samuel would definitely hand Zheng over to others, she was still furious and thought that he would disgrace the Han Clan as he tried to please Nicholas in front of all the Holy Beings like that.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng had two identities. Exposing his first identity was not a big deal to him because after exploring the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Zheng would go to the Everest Spirit Mountain. He knew that once he got through this, no one would be able to reach him.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's second identity was exposed, then he knew that he'd be put into a big mess.</p>

  <p>Nicholas smiled and said, "You're right. I asked Pearl to invite his guy in person the other day, but he refused me. I have planned to send people to the Han Clan again after the Astronomical Transit Day, but I didn't expect to see him here. For some reason, Pearl said that he was very resistant to our Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>"Young people are always a little rebellious and arrogant," Samuel responded with a laugh. "This kid is not clear about the strength of the Dongfang Clan. If he finally comes to terms with that, he will finally be willing to stay in the Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>As these conversations went on, many Holy Beings despised him even more.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful Nicholas was, those clans and Holy Beings that were supported by him would keep their basic dignity. At this point, there was no need for a Holy Being to flatter another being in this way.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, however, seemed to be quite satisfied with the attitude of Samuel. He smiled faintly and uttered, "That's right! If this young man comes to my clan, I will accept him as my personal disciple."</p>
