  <p>When Kenneth saw that the three disciples all wore serious expressions, he simply smiled at them.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. The Cloud Road in the Eastern Region is not as difficult as you have imagined. What is more, you are more powerful than your peers. I'm sure that all of you will do great in the Cloud Road trial!" he said.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming still looked a bit skeptical.</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, is the Cloud Road really a road?" he asked. "Yes, it is. But in reality, the name Cloud Road isn't quite accurate. It's just what we call it here in Cloud Sect. Its original name was Trial Road for Cultivators,"</p>

  <p>Kenneth said slowly.</p>

  <p>The three disciples nodded thoughtfully at Kenneth's words.</p>

  <p>The martial art cultivators of the Eastern Region saw Kenneth as just one of the many strong men from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they saw the emperor of the Burning Sky Empire as a member of Cloud Hall as well.</p>

  <p>Once a disciple passed the test of the Trial Road for Cultivators, he was eligible to join Cloud Hall. It meant that he would have the same status as the leader of Cloud Sect and the emperor of the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>It was why the cultivators in the Eastern Region liked to call it the Cloud Road, also known as a road to Cloud Hall. Some legends even said that once a disciple passed Cloud Road, he would likely become an immortal.</p>

  <p>Of course, such legends were obviously exaggerations. However, these legends showed just how much they yearned for the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, history showed that only a selected few were ever qualified to set foot on the Cloud Road. For most people, that road was destined to exist only in their imaginations.</p>

  <p>"You should know that the three of you aren't the only ones on the trial road. Since there is still a month before the trial road begins, I expect you to be better prepared and achieve good results after a month," Kenneth said. The three disciples nodded obediently in understanding.</p>

  <p>The other good thing was Kenneth could also get a great reward if the disciples of Cloud Sect got good achievements in the Trial Road for Cultivators. If these outstanding disciples managed to join Cloud Hall on his recommendation, he could get more rewards.</p>

  <p>It was the reason Kenneth tuned in attentively to the All Peaks Competition and the strengths of the top three disciples.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what Kenneth had said, the three men began to fantasize about the events and arrangements for the coming month. However, they all knew that the trial was so important for them that they would do their best to pass and get good grades.</p>

  <p>As for what they would encounter on the road and who else would attend the trial, Kenneth spared them the details. They would know everything when the trial came.</p>

  <p>After their discussion, they left Cloud Palace but Zheng didn't return to Drizzle Peak. He had one more important thing to do. He would go home.</p>

  <p>He would fix all the problems of the Luo Clan before he would set out on his way to the Trial Road for Cultivators.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he had arrived in the Luo Clan property in the C County.</p>

  <p>A servant swept the fallen leaves in the open space in front of the Luo house.</p>

  <p>It was particularly cold this winter. All the members of the Luo family weren't happy during the Spring Festival.</p>

  <p>The grand activities that were elaborately prepared in the past years such as the sacred ceremony, the worshiping of ancestors, and walking around the holy mountain, were rushed this year.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Luo clan, from the master to the servants, were overcome with anxiety.</p>

  <p>After the previous master of the Luo clan, Mike Luo had died, the clan's status dropped sharply in the C County.</p>

  <p>When the top families of C Country met to discuss the distribution of mines in the northern part of the C County a few days ago, they didn't call the master of Luo clan to attend at all!</p>

  <p>That only meant that they completely excluded the Luo family from the distribution of benefits, and they wouldn't receive any of them anymore.</p>

  <p>Some members of the younger generation of the Luo clan were dissatisfied, and claimed that they would make the top families pay for their decision. However, what they had said was useless. Bryson, the current master of Luo clan, did not raise any objections to the decision.</p>

  <p>When the servant thought of this, he shook his head as he swept the floor. The Luo clan might become an ordinary and unremarkable small family in the C County under the control of Bryson. But it wouldn't make much to do with him. He was only a servant here. He wouldn't lose anything even if the Luo clan was gone. The worst-case scenario for him was to lose his job and leave here.</p>

  <p>As he swept the floor, he heard a sudden noise coming from the Luo house. He looked around and saw a man flew out of the door and fell heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>The man was covered in blood and bruises from head to toe. "Grey, you're just a servant!" he shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>The sound of a set of heavy footsteps followed. "I'm a descendant of the Luo clan. How dare you kick me out of my house?" the man yelled.</p>

  <p>Grey emerged and stepped on the door's threshold with a smug smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"How dare me? Do you mean I can't drive you away?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Do you dare step inside the door again?"</p>

  <p>Several burly men stood next to Grey.</p>

  <p>They looked at the child of the Luo family who sprawled on the ground with the same sarcastic expression as Grey.</p>

  <p>This child was quite stubborn. Even though he was badly hurt, he jumped up from the ground and dashed to the gate of the Luo house.</p>

  <p>But before he could even cross the gate, two strong men immediately followed him and caught his hands.</p>

  <p>The two strong men were at the bone refining level, while the child of the Luo family was only at the skin refining level. He was obviously no match for these two men at all. Thus, he couldn't move when the two men seized him.</p>
