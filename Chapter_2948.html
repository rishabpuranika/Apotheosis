  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng considered the scene before him with mixed feelings. Given how far he had come, and how high he had risen, these conflicts seemed to him like the quarrels of children at playtime.</p>

  <p>At this stage of his life, he could control all of the resources in the entire divine land, as well as those in the Evolutionary Universe or in the great world.</p>

  <p>To the warriors of the great world, this savage land was a place full of treasures. Yet Zheng knew the truth. If he so asked his father, Mike could make a thousand or ten thousand savage lands in the blink of an eye. It made their disputes, such as the one he faced now, seem quite petty.</p>

  <p>However, looking at Yudie's serious expression, Zheng knew he had to back her up. This was clearly important to her, and treating it lightly would just make her angry with him.</p>

  <p>Concealing his indifference, he looked towards Randy and the rest.</p>

  <p>Solemnly, he said, "As for the matters regarding the savage land, you can make detailed rules. That land doesn't belong to either the Divine Kingdom Continent or the Central Region, but I hope that you can develop it together and live in peace..."</p>

  <p>Randy and the others let out a sigh of relief when they heard Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>But then, Zheng added, "However, no matter what happens, the Divine Kingdom Continent absolutely cannot attack the Central Region or the Cloud Hall. This one time, I'll let it go. But if you dare attack the Central Region or Cloud Hall in the future, I will consider throwing the Divine Kingdom Continent into another great world."</p>

  <p>Zheng's pronouncement stunned his listeners.</p>

  <p>They believed in Zheng's power. Had he told them he could wipe out the entirety of the Divine Kingdom Continent, they would take his words as law. Indeed, they even believed each of the women behind him could just as easily wipe out the Divine Kingdom Continent too. But to throw the Divine Kingdom Continent into another great world? That was impossible.</p>

  <p>Callan was still naive and asked, "Throw the Divine Kingdom Continent into another great world? How?"</p>

  <p>Randy quickly intervened. He raised his hand to get Zheng's attention and said, "We have heard your words, and we will remember. I, on behalf of the Divine Kingdom Continent, vow that we will not start any further conflict with the Central Region."</p>

  <p>It was good that Zheng's arrival had led to a quick solution to their troubles.</p>

  <p>Yet Lewis still looked unhappy.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed Lewis' expression. "Lewis, aren't you satisfied with this result?</p>

  <p>Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>Lewis sighed. "This result is fine. It's just that you and Master Yudie haven't come back for so many years. And now that you've finally returned, you still find me helpless, needing your assistance with this minor matter.</p>

  <p>It's humiliating for me."</p>

  <p>Yudie and Zheng caught each other's eyes, suppressing smiles. So, Lewis felt embarrassed.</p>

  <p>This was something they both understood. After all, Lewis was supposed to be the head of the Cloud Hall. For Zheng to come in and take over would make Lewis feel superfluous and inadequate.</p>

  <p>Yudie gave him a consoling look. "Lewis, you have been in charge of the Cloud Hall for nearly two hundred years. That's even longer than me, and you've done more than I have done. Now, your task is to ascend to the Upper World, so you don't need to deal with these trivial matters by yourself."</p>

  <p>In her turn, Yudie had taken charge of the Cloud Hall for almost twenty years. However, Lewis had been in charge of the sect ten times longer. He had been there for two centuries now.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it had been so long that apart from a few elders in the Cloud Hall, probably no one would recognize Yudie as their former head.</p>

  <p>Lewis looked heartened by Yudie's words. He smiled and said, "Speaking of ascending to the Upper World, I feel like..." He stopped talking, looking bewildered. "What's going on?" he asked, as his feet left the floor.</p>

  <p>In confusion, the people in the Ice Palace all turned towards Lewis, watching what was happening.</p>

  <p>Lewis was rising, waving his arms around to try and grab something that would anchor him to the floor. But he only grasped thin air. He continued to float towards the patio of the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>"He has been rejected by the power of the great world." In unison, everyone turned to look at Zheng, who had spoken. He was watching Lewis with a smile.</p>

  <p>Only Yudie could make sense of what was happening. She and Zheng had both experienced the same thing. They had flown up to the Upper World in a similar way— the normal way.</p>

  <p>Margaret, who had experienced something different, looked at Lewis with great curiosity. She herself had directly stepped into the Soul Sea Realm in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! What should I do? Why, of all times, would I begin to ascend to the Upper World at this exact moment?" Lewis, to his shame, felt like weeping.</p>

  <p>But he did not shed any tears.</p>

  <p>Zheng had finally returned after all these years, and Lewis looked forward to drinking with him. But that was no longer in his hands. The power of the great world was rejecting him right now. Not even Zheng had been able to stop his own ascension to the Upper World after fusing with the great world's will. The great world would naturally kick Lewis out of the world after feeling that his power had exceeded its limit.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't bear to see the helpless look on Lewis' face. Reaching out, he grabbed him from the air.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay at the Cloud Hall for a while. And for as long as I am here, I'll keep you in this world as well," he said.</p>

  <p>After all, no matter how strong the repulsive force of this great world was, it couldn't be greater than Zheng's own strength.</p>

  <p>And so the news of their return spread quickly. After two hundred years, the sudden appearance of Zheng, Yudie, and Margaret caused a stir throughout the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The lifespan of a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could be up to a thousand years. And that of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm could be even longer.</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance had entered the Life and Death Realm. They were only four to five hundred years old. Upon receiving the news, they immediately rushed over, followed by the Ethereal Spirit Sect members. After all, Margaret was among those who had returned. Xander was still worried about his granddaughter.</p>

  <p>Later on, some leaders of fourth and fifth-grade sects also came to see Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know him, his legend was widespread throughout the Central Region. The chance to meet him was an opportunity too great to miss.</p>

  <p>Yudie realized how much she had missed all this. Her days in the Cloud Hall were among her best memories, and now, she felt that she was home at last.</p>

  <p>Nelly and the other girls were curious about the great world. While they had their own inner worlds, where warriors also existed, they had never paid attention to them. With careful observation, they saw that a warrior with the lowest cultivation level also had a wonderful life.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, a secondary creature was incomparable to a divine citizen. But in terms of emotion, there was no difference between them.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it could even be said that the shorter, limited lifespans of the secondary creatures led them to place greater value on their time. They clearly cherished their lives and companions, and sought to make the most of every day, unlike many of the True Gods in the divine land.</p>

  <p>In contrast to Zheng's last visit, this time everyone seemed more relaxed.</p>

  <p>After all, the last time he came back, he had the task of saving Mike. Now, however, the troubles in the divine land seemed to have been resolved. He realized that he was happy here. He didn't even consider returning to the divine land.</p>

  <p>With his women, Zheng traveled around the Central Region, enjoying themselves.</p>

  <p>Naughty Aleyna suppressed her own cultivation base so she could take part in the Martial Arts Contest of World Commercial Alliance, to compete with some new geniuses of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>And so she and the warriors in the Central Region fought in the same arena.</p>

  <p>The expected outcome greatly wounded the morale of the talented people in the Central Region. Zheng berated Aleyna, but she was complacent.</p>

  <p>At one point, Zheng accompanied Aura back to the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect remained the same, but the Burning Sky Empire had changed. Under the new emperor's leadership, the Su Clan was now considered a fourth-grade clan, better than the Cloud Sect. Aura was very gratified by these developments.</p>

  <p>Zheng was indulgent in this matter. If Aura so wished, then he wouldn't prevent her from making the Burning Sky Empire as powerful as Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Yet Aura did not interfere. After all, she had been gone for a long time.</p>

  <p>The ages would change, and the empire would rise and fall, without need of any intervention. The empire's fate was in its own hands, and she thought it wouldn't be a good idea to force her own ideas on them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, several geniuses in the Luo Clan of C County were showing extraordinary talents in the Cloud Sect. One of them became the emperor's son-in-law.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan had become a second-grade clan, and now stood on par with the seven great clans of the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>The journey was pleasant for Zheng, who found himself more relaxed than he had been in a while. Yet someone was still worried.</p>

  <p>After three months, an unexpected voice suddenly spoke up.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, will you stay here for a lifetime?" It was No. 9527, who had been silent all this time.</p>
