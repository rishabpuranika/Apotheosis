<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2527 A Piece Of Blood-red Wild Bone </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The huge skeleton let out a chilling wail, and a giant appeared beside it instantly.</p>

  <p>"That's a hominine giant!" Even though he was tens of thousands of miles away from the giant, Zheng could still see it clearly and knew what it was. "This giant appeared so suddenly. How did it get to this size so quickly? Did it take advantage of the Wild God Power?"</p>

  <p>Zheng remembered that Zelda had told him that although she was already a Wild God, she was at the lowest level and could only grow to two hundred feet high.</p>

  <p>The most powerful Wild God in the world, however, could potentially grow hundreds, even thousands of miles high.</p>

  <p>One mile was equivalent to about five thousand feet.</p>

  <p>The vastness of a thousand-mile tall giant was indescribable. What kind of power could such a giant be capable of unleashing?</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't even begin to imagine.</p>

  <p>Standing before this giant of a thousand miles tall, Zheng seemed smaller than a speck of dust.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that he would see such a creature in the Immemorial Wilderness. It was beyond what any legend could ever describe.</p>

  <p>Soon after its appearance, the giant started to fight the skeleton.</p>

  <p>A gigantic creature like this would let out a huge roar every time it collided with something. The collision and the giant's roar sent shock waves in all directions, which turned into massive, destructive storms.</p>

  <p>Bones of different shapes and sizes were blown all over the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Waves of cold windstorm rolled over the land, and the bones were swept forward towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>If ordinary humans were hit by these bones, they would probably lose half of their lives immediately, and could even die if they were not strong enough.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, just stood there, letting the bones hit him, like a huge rock in a gushing river. His eyes remained firmly fixed on the battle between the two giant beings in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng saw the giant snap the huge skeleton in two along the waist. The giant had won.</p>

  <p>Then, its job done, the giant seemed to evaporate, disappearing from Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>"It should have become smaller again," Zheng mumbled, standing buried almost up to his neck in the bones that were blown over.</p>

  <p>He twisted his body and came out from the bone pile, his expression determined and full of yearning.</p>

  <p>He had successfully sucked the Spiritual Darkness into his body. If he kept cultivating the way his mother had taught him, it would greatly improve his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>If everything went to plan, he would, sooner or later, become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>However, by then, he might still not be able to fight against those Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In addition to those Holy Beings, Zheng would also have to face the master of the Other Shore Realm at some point.</p>

  <p>If he could cultivate the Wild God Power to the extreme, his strength would likely increase exponentially. This was the power that he desired!</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Zheng resumed his search for wild bones.</p>

  <p>As the storm wreaked its havoc on the Immemorial Wilderness, the soil was torn up completely and the wild bones in the depths of the earth came to the surface. Zheng suddenly found that it was much easier to search for wild bones.</p>

  <p>"Three more wild bones to go..."</p>

  <p>"Six pieces of wild bones are buried in this place, and one might need to dig as deep as two hundred feet to find them."</p>

  <p>"Only one piece..."</p>

  <p>Zheng scoured the land, ploughing through the piles of bones like a hardworking little bee.</p>

  <p>While he searched for the wild bones, someone would pass by him occasionally.</p>

  <p>The aura these people emitted was very similar to Zelda's, but it felt much stronger than hers. Zheng guessed they were high-level Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>They didn't seem to pay much heed to Zheng, simply throwing him curious glances before continuing on their way without so much as a word.</p>

  <p>In just half a day, Zheng had collected over eighty pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>About half of those pieces were of a relatively large size.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Once again, he flew dozens of miles, continuing to activate his own soul force to search for bones as he did.</p>

  <p>Everything within the area covered by his mind was forming into grayscale images, standing out clearly in his imagination.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had come across a triangle bone seven miles in front of him. It was tall as a man, and the bone exuded a strong Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"Wow! It's so huge!" Zheng was rather surprised.</p>

  <p>He knew he had not yet reached the center of the Immemorial Wilderness. God only knew how big it was and how long it would take him.</p>

  <p>In order to stay on the safe side, Zheng decided not to go too deep. If he encountered the thousand-mile high giant bones, they might be the death of him. With his current strength level, he had to be cautious.</p>

  <p>Countless years ago, this area had been searched by many people, so only a few small wild bones remained. It was the first wild bone of this size that Zheng had managed to find so far.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng hovered over the ground, staring down into it.</p>

  <p>"It's a thousand feet deep below..."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't waver. Bowing his head, he dived downwards, into the thicket of bones.</p>

  <p>Having reached the bottom, Zheng sharply twisted his hands and grabbed the wild bone. It was tall as a person, and it was heavier than he had expected.</p>

  <p>"It's so heavy!"</p>

  <p>The nine stars in his inner world turned slightly, and power burst out of his arms. He grabbed the wild bone and bored his way back out of the thicket of bones.</p>

  <p>Having reached the surface, Zheng now took a close look at the bone.</p>

  <p>"It's a blood-red wild bone..." A curious expression appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The triangle wild bone should have been a shoulder blade. However, it looked different from the white, jade-like bones he had seen. The entirety of the wild bone emitted blood-red light, and it vibrated with a strong Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how many ordinary wild bones this one is worth."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face lit up with joy as he went to store this wild bone with his space ring.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a gust of wind swept past his ears. He turned his head and saw four figures in the air, moving rapidly towards him.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. This couldn't be a good sign.</p>

  <p>The space ring in his hand flashed slightly, and the man-sized wild bone disappeared into it.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The four figures approaching Zheng sped up, and soon stood in front of him.</p>

  <p>The leader of the four was a thin and pale young man. He was followed by a young girl in a bright red robe, and the other two were dressed as guards.</p>

  <p>"I swear I saw a large blood-red wild bone just now, but then it disappeared! Where is it?" the girl in red robe said, her eyes and voice cold as ice.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes immediately fell on the space ring in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, it must have been hidden by this guy!" said the young man, looking Zheng up and down, his eye arrogant and disdainful.</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are," he continued in a threatening voice, "the wild bones dug up in this area belong to our Blue Sect. Hand it over!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng raised his eyebrows. He had met this kind of fellow many times before.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled coldly and replied, his voice calm, "The bones in the Immemorial Wilderness have no owner. Naturally, they belong to whoever finds them. Why should I hand it to you?"</p>

  <p>The young man, however, didn't want to waste time arguing with Zheng.</p>

  <p>He sneered, "Your life is nothing to me. I will say it again. Hand it to me and I'll let you go! If not, you die. It's that simple."</p>
