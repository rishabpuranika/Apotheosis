</p>

  <p>Although the power of the sword light that was only a few inches long was not great, the sword light was still exceptionally sharp when activated by the Mantra Sword and used by a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>It actually cut open the space between Luo Zheng's eyebrows, leaving a gaping wound three inches long on his forehead!</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Golden blood gushed out freely from Luo Zheng's forehead...</p>

  <p>The three-inch long sword light was just about to cut into Luo Zheng's bone and brain.</p>

  <p>At the side, as Estelle extended her hand, a jade light flashed and blocked the sword light. Then, she waved one hand around the sword light, and a speck of jade light flowed out from her nimble fingers and formed a jade-colored ball of light, trapping the three-inch long sword light inside!</p>

  <p>However, Xun, who stayed close by, made a sad face. "You can obviously eliminate this sword light, but why did you leave behind this section of light and let it injure Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was injured, this wound was clearly not a major injury.</p>

  <p>However, Xun still felt sorry for him.</p>

  <p>After Estelle glanced at Xun, she turned to say to Luo Luo Zheng, "You are a sword cultivator, and the sword intent contained in Murphy's Mantra Divine Dao is also extremely powerful. This sword strike landed on your forehead, allowing you to comprehend the true intent of the swordsmanship. The extent of your comprehension will depend on your own ability."</p>

  <p>If a Holy Being were to make a move, it would send shock waves throughout the entire world. Perhaps no one would be able to survive the Holy Being's sword attack.</p>

  <p>On top of that, Murphy launched the sword strike with his full strength this time!</p>

  <p>However, Estelle decided upon an artful method to resolve it. She even left the three-inch long sword light for Luo Luo Zheng to understand.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard what Estelle said, his heart missed a beat. He hadn't progressed in his comprehension of the swordsmanship for a long time, nor had he even been able to progress on the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. This was one of Luo Zheng's bottlenecks!</p>

  <p>With a flick of Estelle's finger, the ball of light floated to a position in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just now, when Luo Zheng's forehead was cut open, what followed was not an ice-cold sword intent, but an extremely gentle sword intent.</p>

  <p>The sword intent that Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended before had been extremely sharp and fierce, and Luo Luo Zheng had cultivated the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, which pursued the ultimate sharpness. Therefore, the Emotion Closing Divine Dao required one to put aside all their emotions and to possess an undisturbed heart. Only in this way were they able to launch the most powerful sword strike!</p>

  <p>As for Murphy's swordsmanship, it was completely different from any ordinary swordsmanship. It was in every way extremely inclusive. What he pursued was not the ultimate sharpness, but consummation!</p>

  <p>Make a complicated thing simple...</p>

  <p>Turn a simple thing into something more complicated...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's forehead twitched and he could tell that the wound was rapidly healing. Luo Luo Zheng could only feel that he had caught on to some important points. However, these points seemed to be hidden in the mist, making it difficult for him to grasp them clearly.</p>

  <p>Estelle smiled slightly. "It is great when you can comprehend something after being cut by the sword. However, don't think that you can rely on the three-inch long sword light to completely comprehend Murphy's swordsmanship. That is wishful thinking. The sword light can still be kept in my Time Cage for a period of time, so hurry up and comprehend it yourself."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply nodded.</p>

  <p>If a martial artist wanted to break through their bottleneck, they must go through many years of cultivation, or else they had to gain epiphany by going through hundreds of battles.</p>

  <p>It was certainly wishful thinking for Luo Luo Zheng to intend to completely comprehend the swordsmanship after just being hit by the sword strike.</p>

  <p>However, his previous comprehension had indeed yielded some benefits for him. The three-inch long sword light was extremely useful to his swordsmanship. Therefore, he carefully stored the jade-colored ball of light away...</p>

  <p>The woman in blue who had suddenly appeared had disintegrated Murphy's sword strike.</p>

  <p>This surprised the Supreme Lords in the universe and the Sacred Supreme Lords, and they were all speechless.</p>

  <p>The woman chatted freely with Luo Luo Zheng. Besides her beautiful face and her mysterious attractiveness, there didn't seem to be anything special about her appearance. However, every Supreme Lord who looked at her had a face filled with great reverence.</p>

  <p>For some reason this woman was incredibly scary...</p>

  <p>Even Master Feng and the others would not utter a single word. They were content to let Luo Luo Zheng talk to her and discuss the plan of action!</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race was still kneeling on the ground. To behold their creator was the greatest possible honor for every Sacred martial artist. But, Murphy's situation at this time caused them to fall into even greater despair.</p>

  <p>If even Holy Murphy could be blocked by this woman, then what hope did the Sacred race have now?</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord and the remaining Sacred Supreme Lords behind him slowly rose to their feet...</p>

  <p>After the Grand Supreme Lord had licked his dry lips, he said softly,</p>

  <p>"We lost, but the mission given to us by Holy Murphy must still be continued. He told us to pay attention to the Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe; they are of supreme importance! Now I understand. He was referring to the most important person! And only that one!"</p>

  <p>The supreme world fragment under the feet of the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race was moving away from Luo Luo Zheng and the others. Although they were separated by a great distance and the Grand Supreme Lord did not point out the most important person, the Sacred Supreme Lords behind him clearly understood that the Grand Supreme Lord was referring to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This person was crucial...</p>

  <p>Just now, Murphy had tried with all his might to kill this young man, but he was not able to do it.</p>

  <p>Now that the Sacred race had totally lost the war, their last purpose was to find a way to kill Luo Luo Zheng. All of the Sacred Supreme Lords present knew that this was an impossible mission.</p>

  <p>What they were actually pursuing was just a worthy death.</p>

  <p>"Kill," the Grand Supreme Lord spoke.</p>

  <p>The surviving Sacred Supreme Lords also exploded with the strong killing intent as they unleashed their own treasures and Heavenly Destiny...</p>

  <p>Blood-colored Space Laws were formed. After they employed the Grand Teleportation technique, they all rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Are these guys really that anxious to die?" Blayd chuckled as he stood up.</p>

  <p>"They aren't qualified to fight even when their lives are on the line."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle raised her eyebrows. The entire Humanity Alliance had been destroyed in the Sacred race's invasion. Thus she really hated the Sacred Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>"They just want a decent way to die, so let's kill them," Master Feng uttered, correctly interpreting the Grand Supreme Lord's thoughts.</p>

  <p>The path of martial arts was a road filled with helplessness. Even the True Gods in the divine land could do nothing of their own free wills.</p>

  <p>True, they could be immortal, without being fettered by their lifespan, but in the end, even greater shackles were placed on them.</p>

  <p>The last wave of attacks from the Sacred Supreme Lords were directed straight at Luo Luo Zheng. Unfortunately for them, just as they executed the Grand Teleportation technique, they were blocked by Master Feng and the others. After that, Blayd activated his fighting intent and joined the fray.</p>

  <p>In this situation, the Sacred Supreme Lords were at a distinct disadvantage.</p>

  <p>As the heavens of the Murphy Universe continued to shake, all of the remaining Supreme Lords fell to the ground and died.</p>

  <p>The shock of the heavens was originally transmitted only through the Heavenly Destiny, and was only detected by the Supreme Lords. When the Grand Supreme Lord died, Blayd also smashed the spinulose wood fern to pieces!</p>

  <p>Although the Heavens-suppressing Object that the Grand Supreme Lord controlled was not the true form of the spinulose wood fern, it still had a great impact on the Murphy Universe. Under the crazy vibration of the heavens, all of the Sacred martial artists in the Murphy Universe could sense it.</p>

  <p>From that point onwards, not one Supreme Lord remained in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>However, the loss of the Supreme Lords of the Murphy Universe wasn't a major blow to Murphy. After dissipating, the Heavenly Destiny would automatically return to the heavens and appear again in some form in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>For example, the Heavenly Destiny in the Evolutionary Universe took the form of the Crown of Destiny, and the Heavenly Destiny in the Murphy Universe would appear in some corner of the universe in the form of the Heavenly Destiny seed.</p>

  <p>However, the entire Sacred race's force had been stable for countless years. With the retraction of the Heavenly Destiny, the Sacred race could start to experience intense internal strife and upheaval. That wasn't what Murphy wanted to see...</p>
