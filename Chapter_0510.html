<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>His eyes resting on her wide smile, Luo Zheng clenched his fists tighter and made himself a silent promise to protect his little sister till his dying breath. Even if one day he had to sacrifice himself for that, he would hardly hesitate. He would exhaust the last of his strength to give his sister Yan a safe, secure, and happy future. To Luo Zheng, she was the most important person, his invaluable treasure, the only family member he had left.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't know was that everything was destined under the law of the world. Whatever he might encounter, experience, and suffer was set in stone for him. It would undoubtedly be a journey of hardships, but Yan Luo would act as the guide to his fate, the light that paved way for him to march forward. This was Luo Zheng and Yan's destiny, but neither of them realized it at the moment.</p>

  <p>Early morning next day, the elders of the Luo Clan followed behind Luo Zheng as he climbed the hill that was in the backyard of the Luo house. It was a blessed site.</p>

  <p>This was the Luo Clan's cemetery. Several tombstones were dug into the ground. They loomed silently and solemnly on the hill. The ancestors of the Luo Clan slept soundly in this tranquil and dignified atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng prayed piously to the fathers of Luo.</p>

  <p>As the new leader of the Luo Clan, this was the first ritual that signified his venerable status.</p>

  <p>Three bamboo incense sticks had been lit up by the servants. Luo Zheng held them in his hands and bowed three times in front of his father's tomb.</p>

  <p>Having finished the worship ritual, Luo Zheng left the graveyard, his expression becoming sterner. The intention to kill was clear in his eyes. Some of the people in C County must die for their sins!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a room located on the highest story of the Crescent Building in C County, five people sat around a table, discussing things of significance.</p>

  <p>The five were the leaders of the current top five clans of the C County.</p>

  <p>They represented the Huang Clan, the Qi Clan, the He Clan, the Zhang Clan, and the Chen Clan. These days, nearly all the mineral resources, the shops, and the gambling stalls in C County came under their jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan had once ranked first� being the richest, strongest, and most powerful clan that had suppressed all others in the C County.</p>

  <p>However, as the Luo Clan began to fall and decline, its place at the top had been replaced by the others. Gradually, the Luo Clan had ebbed away and dropped to the sixth place. The properties that had once belonged to the Luo Clan were snatched up by the other five clans. Now, the Luo Clan had become so insignificant and dispensable that no one even cared to mention it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo! He must die! My son Darcy was killed in his hands. I have to avenge my son! Does Luo Zheng believe that with the Cloud Sect to back him, he can breach protocol and kill anyone he wants? He can't take what he wants so ruthlessly!" A man shouted, so much in anger that his face went red.</p>

  <p>It was Chuck Huang, Darcy's father. He sat at the helm of the round table and was the head of the Huang Clan.</p>

  <p>Chuck had a lot of children, but Darcy had happened to be his favorite.</p>

  <p>He was Chuck's first son and the most talented among all of Chuck's offspring. Chuck had wanted to devote everything, every resource that belonged to the Huang Clan on Darcy, for his growth and education.</p>

  <p>Darcy would have been worthy of this investment. What Chuck hadn't expected was that rat Luo Zheng to come back to the Luo Clan. Before Chuck could do anything about it, Darcy had already been involved in the conflict within the Luo Clan and killed under Zheng's sword for some unknown and inexplicable reasons. Chuck only knew that a friend whom Darcy had been hanging around with recently was from the Luo Clan, but how did that relate to Luo Zheng? Why did Luo Zheng kill Darcy? What was the connection between the two? How did they even meet? Did Darcy do something to attract that kind of hatred from Luo Zheng? And how deep was this hatred that Luo Zheng just killed Darcy without even a second thought?</p>

  <p>After all, Darcy had been the Huang's heir. He had been quite a talent among the younger generation, not to forget that he belonged to the most respected clan of C County. Chuck knew nothing of the affair, but he trusted his son to be the innocent one. How was he supposed to endure his poor son's death?</p>

  <p>"Well, I do agree with you. I believe Luo Zheng must die too. But how are we going to deal with him? I've heard that even the notorious Blood Prisoner, who was wanted by the government at any cost, has been killed by him. Chuck, I doubt you are unfamiliar with the Blood Prisoner's strength or how powerful he was," Ford replied, worry etched across his face.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the one who feared Luo Zheng the most at the moment was Ford himself.</p>

  <p>The other heads might be afraid of Luo Zheng at some level, but they didn't have any real and profoundly irreconcilable issues with him. They had nothing more than some small conflicts or disputes regarding the interests of their clans. Luo Zheng had no vendetta with them. The Worst case scenario, they would have to relinquish the industries and properties they had robbed from the Luo Clan and give them back to Luo Zheng. Maybe they would even compensate some more with money, and they would be fine.</p>

  <p>Even Chuck could move on from the death of his son and refrain from avenging Darcy. He could swallow his resentment for Luo Zheng. But it wouldn't be the same for Ford. He had killed Zheng's father, Mike Luo, personally! It was not even slightly similar to encroaching on the benefits of the Luo Clan. Once Luo Zheng learned the identity of his father's true murderer, he would not forgive Ford. Luo Zheng would kill him! Ford could already foresee his miserable ending. The chances of him remaining alive were slim, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Now that Bryson had been executed, then his cowardly brother, Ken, must have already given Ford away. It was only a matter of time before Luo Zheng marched to Ford's place and took his life.</p>

  <p>The Huang Clan, the He Clan, the Chen Clan, and the Zhang Clan had the choice of surrendering their wealth to oblige Luo Zheng and seek his forgiveness. Their heads could make grants to the Luos for the safety of their clans. But Ford Qi, he would have to surrender his life! All to quench Zheng's burning fire of hatred and revenge! For the redemption for his sins, Ford would have to die in the hopes that Luo Zheng would at least spare the Qi clan.</p>
