  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mike, Tianming, and Bromley were on the tombstone at the periphery of the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>They couldn't clearly see what was happening at the top of the divine land. But they did see the head which was fifty thousand times its original size thrown into the air and shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Bromley was stunned for a while. He could manage to mutter only two words. "A miracle!"</p>

  <p>"Irrespective of whether or not it's a miracle, at least the divine land is safe now," Holy Jay said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That blood man is standing at the top of the divine land! Let's go and have a look!" Mike said, a space fluctuation rippling on the surface of his body. He got into the space channel and flew towards the divine land.</p>

  <p>"There are still heads that haven't been dealt with," Tianming said. .</p>

  <p>He had hardly finished talking before he realized that the Holy Beings had already left.</p>

  <p>Tianming also wanted to go to the top of the divine land to see who that person was and how he could possess such an incredible theurgy.</p>

  <p>But the thought of the heads and how they had no one to take care of them made him suppress his curiosity and rush towards the nearest head, which had expanded to ten thousand times its original size.</p>

  <p>"Lone Sword!"</p>

  <p>The moment Tianming took out this Other Shore Token, a blood-red figure appeared on the head.</p>

  <p>This figure held a blood sword and then stabbed into the head, causing it to shatter into pieces before Tianming. .</p>

  <p>The figure then dispersed quickly.</p>

  <p>But before it dissipated, it turned to look at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming was stunned.</p>

  <p>Although this man was wrapped in a thick layer of dark red blood so that Tianming couldn't see his real appearance, Tianming felt that the outline of this face was somewhat familiar. It was precisely the shape of Zheng's face!.</p>

  <p>The bloody man disappeared from before Tianming.</p>

  <p>"I must be thinking too much. How could it be Zheng?" Tianming muttered, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>His gaze then locked onto the next head. This head was now eight hundred times its original size. The bloody man appeared on this head as well.</p>

  <p>"Has he teleported to reach this head? Or... it is an avatar?"</p>

  <p>Tianming observed more heads and found a blood red figure on each of them.</p>

  <p>There were over ten thousand heads of different sizes in the Ruin Graveyard, and over ten thousand blood-red figures attacked these heads at the same time. They managed to kill all these heads in a while.</p>

  <p>"With so many powerful avatars, it looks like I don't need to make a move!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Tianming flew towards the top of the divine land, smiling bitterly.</p>

  <p>At the top of the divine land, Lorena held Zheng tightly in her arms, sobbing.</p>

  <p>Rosie walked around Zheng.</p>

  <p>She looked her nephew up and down, comparing him with the Zheng in her impression.</p>

  <p>However, other than his appearance, Zheng's aura was completely different from before.</p>

  <p>The last time she saw him, Zheng had already mastered two Truths of Godly Ways. These Truths of Godly Ways affected Zheng's temperament, and he had an edge while being forthright at that time.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that Zheng was no longer what he used to be.</p>

  <p>If this guy hadn't just thrown the head that had expanded to fifty thousand times its original size into the sky, Rosie would have thought that he was at the same level as them.</p>

  <p>"Mother, I haven't finished the mission my grandfather gave me. The situation in the Source World is very complicated and is no longer what it used to be. I didn't even kill our enemies myself. Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer are dead, but someone else killed them. But I have found the remaining members of the Nine Li race. They are all in the Pear Hill,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said to Lorena.</p>

  <p>Lorena's eyes welled up as she looked at Zheng, but she was happy as she said, "You've done a good job. Where is Yan? Is she all right?"</p>

  <p>"She's fine. She's now in the Pear Hill," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where is Geoffrey?" Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>"He-" Zheng hesitated before continuing, "He's fine as well."</p>

  <p>Whatever he knew about Geoffrey, he had obtained from the disciple of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Dale. It was difficult for Zheng to describe the state of the Abstruse Energy World to Lorena.</p>

  <p>But Lorena couldn't remain calm anymore. "What happened to Geoffrey?</p>

  <p>Is he really all right?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story. He's not in the chaos," Zheng said vaguely, having no choice but to extend some form of explanation to her.</p>

  <p>"Long story? What are you talking about? He is Lorena's grandson!</p>

  <p>Explain more clearly!" Rosie chimed in.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a headache coming on.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was another space fluctuation beside him.</p>

  <p>Bromley, Mike, Holy Jay, Joy, and the other Holy Beings walked out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>They froze as their eyes focused on Zheng, their hearts beating faster as they took in Zheng's appearance, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p>

  <p>It was so absurd when the most impossible thing they thought really happened.</p>

  <p>"Did you just throw the head fifty thousand times its original size to the sky?" Mike asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?" Mike asked again, astonished.</p>

  <p>All he wanted to know was the answer to this question, all other thoughts fleeing his mind.</p>

  <p>Bromley, Holy Jay, and Joy probably had the same thought as they stared at Zheng with eager eyes.</p>

  <p>"Because this is my inner world," Zheng replied. "I can do it with the omniscient power."</p>

  <p>"Your inner world..." Mike said wonderingly.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings seemed suddenly enlightened, and Bromley said, "Is it because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method and the Primal Chaos Technique that you were able to achieve this?"</p>

  <p>Back then, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had given these to Bromley, who had then passed them down to Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the time, Bromley had known that the inner world cultivated with this method would be completely different from ordinary inner worlds.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't expected Zheng's inner world to become so huge!</p>

  <p>When Zheng spotted Bromley, he took a few steps towards him and knelt before him. "Master, greetings!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen Bromley when he'd been in the fairy palace, but that had only been an illusion that Bromley had left behind.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had met his master.</p>

  <p>"Please stand up." Bromley tried to help Zheng up. "I accepted you as my disciple because your father asked me to. But actually, I never personally instructed you. Now that you have achieved such an unfathomable level of cultivation, being your master is more than what I deserve!"</p>

  <p>"You will always be my master, no matter how strong or weak I am.</p>

  <p>Besides, going by what you said, Hallet and Gus can no longer be your disciples, either." Zheng knelt back on the ground, refusing to stand up.</p>

  <p>Hallet and Augustus had already surpassed Bromley in strength, but they still recognized Bromley as their master.</p>

  <p>"Bromley, that's true. You still recognize Hallet and Augustus as your disciples. Why should Zheng be any different?" Mike said from beside him.</p>

  <p>Bromley nodded as he said, "I was wrong. Having Zheng as my disciple is probably the best thing I've done in my life!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he helped Zheng to his feet.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Hallet, and Augustus emerged from the space channel, one after the other.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Zheng, they all looked as if they had seen a ghost. Augustus's eyes, in particular, were wide as saucers.</p>
