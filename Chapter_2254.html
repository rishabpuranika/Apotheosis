  <p>Although Joy's question came off lighthearted and casual, Luo Luo Zheng had a hard time finding the words to answer her.</p>

  <p>He had no clue whether or not Han Liusu had gone anywhere other than the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. As the Princess Royal of the Han Clan, what she said and what she did were under the scrutiny of many. If Luo Luo Zheng were to make up a story on the spot, he was afraid that Joy would see right through him in an instant.</p>

  <p>Noticing the embarrassed look on Luo Zheng's face, Joy said indifferently, "I think Han Liusu knows something? something important like your true identity. Over the years, I've never seen her leave the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>She's never even travelled to the Han Clan's ancestral land. In fact, the only time she left the Floating Island was to go to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. I can only deduce that if you met her before, then you could only have met her in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered with two rays of pale purple light, as though there were two worlds flowing deep within. She was attractive and resonated a curious beauty. Such powerful warriors at high levels of cultivation always had their unique and incomparable charm. "Divine citizens living outside the Floating Islands aren't qualified to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Only the descendants and disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands can enter. You just joined the Han Clan, and thus, I know you aren't from any of those wealthy clans."</p>

  <p>Joy's analysis made Luo Zheng's heart jump from his chest to his mouth. If nothing else, he had to admit that she was very clever. She had a unique way of analyzing so many situations with such simple information.</p>

  <p>"Most likely, you come from a Holy Being's universe," continued Joy, now staring at Luo Luo Zheng. "And all living creatures that come from the universes must be led by the members of the Jiang Clan, and all names on the list will be registered in the Hall of Holy Beings. I remember that the 833rd rule of the Ruling Slate was activated not long ago, and the punishment for stowaways was triggered, but the matter remained unsettled. The Hall of Holy Beings had sent people to investigate, but no results came from such. This is all very strange."</p>

  <p>She narrowed her beautiful eyes and glared at Luo Luo Zheng with growing interest.</p>

  <p>She looked like a smart, sly fox. With a meaningful smile on her face, she went on to say, "Harold has been acting very reckless recently. I don't like that brat very much. Ever since Mike lost his status and his Floating Island, he's done nothing but lead the Luo Clan members to cause trouble in other clans, relying on the Everest Spirit Mountain. And last time, he nearly got into a fight with me, too. This time around, they even dared fight with the Jiang Clan, with the purpose of forcing the clan to withdraw all their members from the universes. I guess his master, Mike, might have something to do with it."</p>

  <p>Now it was Luo Zheng's turn to stare at Joy, and his face grew completely gloomy. Although he tried hard to cover his emotions, his heart was beating very fast in his chest. He had no idea what he was about to face.</p>

  <p>He felt like a lamb being put up for slaughter in front of Joy, and whether or not she was going to kill him was completely up to her.</p>

  <p>"I'd say you're from the Evolutionary Universe, and everything was arranged by Mike. Am I guessing correctly?" Joy asked, as she slowly walked toward Luo Luo Zheng. A strong fragrance greeted his nose as she approached. Although the fragrance was heavy, it wasn't enough to make people feel tired. Instead, people would be fascinated by the smell and thought it was attractive. For Luo Luo Zheng, he couldn't help himself but sniff it out again and again.</p>

  <p>She raised her hand and gently grasped onto Luo Zheng's chin. "From the very beginning, I just felt that this was all very strange. It's just impossible for a talent like you to emerge from the divine citizens. I mean, it would have been hard for even the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands to have trained a talent like you. Perhaps you're that woman's child, not an ordinary divine embryo. More importantly though, your surname hasn't been changed. You still use the Luo surname. That is why I've come to the conclusion that you're Mike's son."</p>

  <p>"That woman? What woman? What do you mean by that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in a dry, flat voice. Joy had just said that he was possibly the baby of some woman and that he wasn't an ordinary divine embryo. Did Joy know who his mother was? In the past, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained a few clues that indicated his mother was still alive. He and Yan weren't merely created by Mike, and they did have a mother. Now that his guess had been confirmed by Joy, his curiosity was piqued of course, and he had to ask her more questions.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to ask so many questions," said Joy with a light and friendly smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was still gloomy. He hadn't expected Joy to guess what had happened with just a few words about Han Liusu. And did she say that even Harold had tried fighting her? Could this mean that Joy was actually standing on the Luo Clan's opposing side? Luo Luo Zheng had too many questions swimming in his mind. This was only one of several possibilities, but it definitely wasn't good news.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Luo Luo Zheng asked anew, frowning slightly. This time, he didn't even call her "Master," now that he knew she might actually be an enemy.</p>

  <p>Joy's eyes flashed suddenly and she turned around; the cunning expression on her face left just as quickly as it came. She changed from a sly woman to an innocent girl, with eyes wide open. "Take it easy. The world is so boring! At that time, Mike wanted to make the world more interesting. I was looking forward to it, but he failed. What a pity!</p>
