<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1616 Corridors </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thin bolt of lightning struck down like spring thunders, causing the Hall of Causality to begin to reconstruct.</p>

  <p>Large amounts of fragments emerged from all the stone pillars. These fragments seemed to know exactly where to fit in and were continuously combining and reorganizing with each other.</p>

  <p>Roofs, girders, eaves, walls, doors and floors were gradually formed.</p>

  <p>A great hall was being built by an invisible force. Not long after, a magnificent hall appeared before everyone. They were now standing within a round-shaped hall where six corridors were built.</p>

  <p>"Six passages?"</p>

  <p>"In other words... Does this mean that the six of us have to go separately?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't the Hall of Causality require division of labor and cooperation?"</p>

  <p>No one knew why the Hall of Causality was arranged this way so they stared at each other with confused looks.</p>

  <p>They knew however that if they wanted to pass the Hall of Causality, they had to follow the rules. If the Hall of Causality really wanted to separate them, they would have no other choice but to comply.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At this moment, the doors of each corridor began to glow in a shiny blue light.</p>

  <p>The lightning bolts began to converge and words could be read. Each door had the name of one of the warriors inscribed in it.</p>

  <p>Janet Ji, Jeffrey Jin, Hailey, Coleman, Ansel and  Zheng Luo.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo?!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned when they saw this name inscribed in one of the doors.</p>

  <p>They then turned to look at Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>From the six people only Tianxing had the surname Luo, but the name Tianxing Luo was not in any corridor. This was the only name that was missing.</p>

  <p>"I told you! Tianxing Luo is definitely a fake name!" Janet's eyes flickered as she looked at Zheng with a smile. "I just didn't know that Tianxing is the famous  Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had already become a legend among the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Regardless of his strength, his stories had spread throughout the supreme worlds. People had heard the stories so many times that they could re-tell all of them with all the details.</p>

  <p>Even the most ignorant and ill-informed martial artists would have heard of Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, there was someone in the universe who would tell stories every once in a while using the Roar Token. Everyone had to listen to him whether they wanted to or not. These stories were interesting and made many people obsessed. These people would have to wait for several months until they could get the ending of a story because the storyteller always left them in suspense. His closing line at the of each session was always "To what happened thereafter, that will be disclosed next time.".</p>

  <p>After killing the four Supreme Lords, this was how Zheng had passed his days in the past six years. The trillions of lives in the universe had also passed their time under the baptism of his "voice".</p>

  <p>Janet, Jeffrey, Hailey and the others were no exception.</p>

  <p>"You... are you really  Zheng Luo?" Jeffrey asked while staring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled helplessly. He could no longer hide his identity. He never thought that his name would appear at the last Hall of Causality. Zheng could only nod. "Yes, I am  Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha" Jeffrey laughed heartily as he pounded his fist on Zheng's shoulder. He complained as he laughed, "You have caused me a lot of suffering in the past few years!"</p>

  <p>"Why are you saying that? What have I done to harm you?" Zheng asked, feeling confused.</p>

  <p>Of course Zheng didn't know how much trouble he had caused to other people with his stories. Jeffrey had been cultivating in seclusion in a temple, mediating and following Buddhist rules. A peaceful and quiet environment was very important for him to keep focused and be free from any disturbance and distraction.</p>

  <p>Even though he was not an orthodox Buddhist disciple, he was still practicing it.</p>

  <p>Normally, the Supreme Lords would only occasionally say a few words through the Roaring Tokens. After all, Roaring Tokens were very precious and should be used carefully not to waste them. If it wasn't something extremely important, the Supreme Lords would usually only say a few words once in a while.</p>

  <p>Even though Jeffrey's willpower allowed him to filter out the ordinary disturbance caused by outer noises ringing in his ears, however, Zheng's voice never stopped. Moreover, he wasn't speaking a few words, he was telling stories over and over again.</p>

  <p>The stories were full of fantasies and imagination and they were always fascinating to hear.</p>

  <p>When Jeffrey was in closed-doors cultivation, he heard the stories still echoing in his ears constantly. His mind could not help but get distracted and follow Zheng's stories.</p>

  <p>To meditate on Buddhism, the most important thing was to be free from human desires and passions and not be distracted in the slightest.</p>

  <p>With Zheng telling stories vividly in his ear, Jeffrey could not find his peace. It was fortunate that he hadn't spiraled into madness during his cultivation, but his progress had been greatly hindered.</p>

  <p>When Jeffrey finished telling Zheng why he had been such a nuisance, Coleman immediately nodded his head in agreement. "Me too! I'm also a victim of your never-ending stories ..."</p>

  <p>Hailey had a smile on her face but she did not say a word. No one knew if she had been affected by Zheng during her closed-doors cultivation or not.</p>

  <p>There were so many living creatures in the universe and some of the martial artists were cultivating in seclusion when Zheng was telling a story.</p>

  <p>Some might have even been at a critical stage in their cultivation. The Roaring Token had caused a great deal of trouble for many martial artists, causing a large number of cases of warriors going berserk.</p>

  <p>Now everyone finally realized why this so-called Tianxing possessed such a powerful strength.</p>

  <p>Janet had a smile on her face the entire time. Once again, she thought of Lucille.</p>

  <p>She always thought that Lucille was an invincible existence and that Lucille had the power to be a champion. But she was defeated by Zheng once and she didn't know if Lucille would have the opportunity to fight Zheng again.</p>

  <p>If they were to fight, would Lucille be the winner? Perhaps Zheng was stronger and would defeat her easily.</p>

  <p>Before she thought that Zheng had the power to face Lucille but that in the end he would still lose.</p>

  <p>Now, Janet understood that Zheng would definitely be one of the strongest opponents Lucille would face. Not only did this guy hide his name but he also hid his true strength and power.</p>

  <p>Everyone was extremely interested in Zheng. They started asking him a lot of questions about the Roaring Token, about the fairy palace, and about all the other things they heard in his stories.</p>

  <p>Zheng answered their questions as best as he could. For some topics he would not hide, he just told them the truth frankly. But for some questions that he could not answer, he simply tried to divert the topic.</p>

  <p>"I think... Everyone should focus our attention back to this place!" As he spoke, he pointed to the six corridors ahead.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't anticipated that these people would be so curious. Their questions came one after another. Apart from Hailey, the others just kept on shooting questions non-stop.</p>

  <p>He couldn't take it anymore and all he wanted to do was to move on.</p>

  <p>He tried to shift everyone's attention and put the issue on the right track, making them focus on the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Janet stuck out her tongue. She smiled and said, "Alright, I was just gossiping. I knew that you had also entered the Illusion Battlefield but I didn't expect to meet you here."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "That's true! But the most important thing right now is the Hall of Causality, not me. For these six passages, each of us should follow the path that has your own name on it and enter."</p>

  <p>After finishing his words, Zheng walked towards the door of the corridor next to him. Janet's name was on that corridor which meant that this corridor was for Janet to enter.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng tried to walk into the long corridor, an irresistible force stopped him from entering.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't force it. This was the Hall of Causality. Since he was not allowed to enter, then he would not forcefully break in.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that they would have to finish the rest of the journey by themselves. After making some preparations, they all entered their respective corridors.</p>

  <p>Among them, Coleman was the one who looked the most depressed.</p>

  <p>He hadn't done anything along the way. He just followed everyone else here. He relied on all the others to get here.</p>

  <p>From now on he would have to rely on himself. He was not feeling sure about this and had no confidence in his eyes. He entered into his own corridor with a long and worried face.</p>

  <p>Zheng also took a step forward after taking a glance at the long corridor in front of him to enter.</p>

  <p>This corridor was very wide, so wide that a carriage could enter and rush through it without problem.</p>

  <p>Walking on the soft carpet gave Zheng the illusion that the fifth Hall of Causality wasn't difficult to go through.</p>

  <p>After walking several dozen feet, Zheng suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>A torch was hanging up on the wall in front of him. The flame was burning brightly as it illuminated the corridor he was in.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt that something weird was burning in the flames.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a powerful soul within the flames!" Zheng muttered as he stared at the torch.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how strong this soul was. If it was able to cause pressure on Zheng's soul, the strength of this soul would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>'Is this the test? Should I do something about it or just ignore it?' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to ignore the flames and planned to go around it.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was passing the torch, a strange pressure suddenly burst out from the torch and enveloped Zheng.</p>
