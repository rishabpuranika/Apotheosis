<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1785 Chains Of Curses </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The core disciples were rendered speechless as they watched the skulls spin in the air.</p>

  <p>Not even Preston could resist the curses of the sorcerer race, but the Godly Geniuses dealt with them rather easily.</p>

  <p>And on another note, they accepted the astonishing fact without resistance.</p>

  <p>They understood that the Godly Geniuses' strengths couldn't be measured merely by their cultivation levels. Since these geniuses shouldered more responsibilities and missions in this grand era, it was necessary for them to have a broad knowledge of everything in the world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mu Ning was watching as Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie held each other tightly� she was utterly disgruntled.</p>

  <p>Although she was willing to go and help Luo Zheng out, the scene in front of her was admittedly upsetting.</p>

  <p>After a long embrace, Luo Zheng finally loosened his arms and let Ning Yudie stand on her own.</p>

  <p>It was their first reunion after seven full years. With too many words to exchange, they wondered where they should begin.</p>

  <p>Finally, Ning Yudie broke the silence. "You� You've seen Geoffrey, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng offered a gentle nod.</p>

  <p>"Is he alright?" she asked, the nervousness evident in her voice. Having ascended to the Upper World for so long, she was always worrying about her young son.</p>

  <p>"Of course he is. Let's return to the Cloud Hall," Luo Zheng suggested with a smile� he had decided to bring Ning Yudie and the other important ones into the fairy palace. While the entire universe was in chaos, the fairy place remained absolutely safe.</p>

  <p>"But the skulls..." Ning Yudie pointed at the sky.</p>

  <p>Numerous skulls still spun slowly in the sky above them like a huge, black cloud.</p>

  <p>"Just leave those to Tianming," Luo Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>To that, Tianming turned to him and nodded.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his finger, a strange sound came from the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>It sounded like the hiss of a snake.</p>

  <p>In an instant, numerous strands of black lines appeared in everyone's eyes as they watched the swirl in the sky.</p>

  <p>These mysterious black lines linked the skulls in the sky and the warriors on the ground. Most of them were connected to Preston alone.</p>

  <p>Although Tianming didn't explain it to them, they all figured out what this meant� Preston was the curses' main target.</p>

  <p>The core disciples, meanwhile, found only a number of lines connected them to the skulls.</p>

  <p>Even Ning Yudie was connected to the skulls with two black lines.</p>

  <p>"These are the chains of curses. A curse is a rather special type of attack.</p>

  <p>Under specific circumstances, these chains are indestructible unless the curse is removed," Tianming explained promptly.</p>

  <p>These strong curses were caused by some sort of sorcery from the divine land. Very few people had the ability to break them, and even those who could found it difficult to do so.</p>

  <p>Because of this, even if some Supreme Lords were cursed, they couldn't bother to remove the curses. Instead, they merely allowed the skulls to stick to them until the curses dissipated on their own.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't the same for all the other warriors� the world lords felt pressure from the skulls while most of the warriors under the Spirit Transformation Realm were doomed to death.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all warriors, regardless of their cultivation bases, would try to avoid the Shadow Race, also known as the sorcerer race, altogether.</p>

  <p>"You can just cut these chains off by yourselves. It's much easier than you would think," Tianming added. With a snap of his fingers, a strand of a black line broke instantly like a fragile strand of hair.</p>

  <p>As the black line was cut, the skull on its other end started cracking until it soon vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>With that, Tianming didn't explain any further. It was no easy feat to make the curse chains visible� this meant that the masters of sorceries from the divine land actually managed to grasp the Cursing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>This practice declined after the Soaring Snake Sword appeared in the world� it had the power to remove all kinds of curses.</p>

  <p>Although everyone could see the curse chains, they hadn't dared touch them, unsure if they should. After seeing how Tianming broke one line rather easily, they all began cutting off the chains that connected them to the skulls� they were all disgusted enough of the skulls that stuck to them all the while.</p>

  <p>As the chains were cut one after another, the skulls turned into ashes and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Among them, Preston was the most striking with tens of thousands of lines connected to him� he looked like some kind of monster with impossibly long hair.</p>

  <p>Summoning up his power of Space Law, he created a crystal cube that enveloped him and cut off all the chains of curses around him.</p>

  <p>In an instant, tens of thousands of skulls broke apart and vanished.</p>

  <p>Finally breathing a sigh of relief, Preston walked up to Luo Zheng and Tianming and cupped his hands as he said, "Thank you for saving my life!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind, I should be the one thanking you. If you didn't offer your help, my wife wouldn't have survived this," Luo Zheng returned as he bowed to Preston with respect� he had heartfelt gratitude towards the man who saved his wife, after all.</p>

  <p>Although he had rushed and led his team to the Divine Kingdom Continent as soon as he knew that Ning Yudie was here, she would've died before he arrived without Preston's help.</p>

  <p>"Has the Shadow Race been wiped out?" Lucille was looking around to check if they were completely gone.</p>

  <p>It seemed they managed to escape danger for now.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just then, they saw several warriors flying right at them from afar.</p>

  <p>Brennan, the present emperor of the York Divine Kingdom, led the group. Behind him were the emperors of the other three divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>When Brennan arrived first, he landed on the ground and greeted Luo Zheng politely� he had seen Luo Zheng before when he was still a prince of his divine kingdom.</p>
