  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Ray Tree was located in the easternmost area of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The giant tree had twisted roots and gnarled branches, the longest root having penetrated several large regions.</p>

  <p>The trunk of the tree extended to the sky, forming a huge cloud-like cover.</p>

  <p>Standing above this cloud cover, one could see a vast sea of clouds in any direction. Compared to the Sunrest Tree, which was also known as the Non-combat Zone of the Sword Clan, the Ray Tree looked more charming and magnificent.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Divine City was built on the top of the cloud cover.</p>

  <p>A cloud-capped tower stood at the center of the Dongfang Divine City.</p>

  <p>A huge transmission array was built on the top of the tower, and was connected to the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>The qualifications that were needed to enter the Floating Island were few, but there were many disciples of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Every year, there would be a number of outstanding talents who wanted to enter the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan by climbing the tower.</p>

  <p>To the members of the Dongfang Clan, entering the tower meant success.</p>

  <p>Buzz.</p>

  <p>The transmission array at the top of the tower began to glow.</p>

  <p>And then, Pierson walked out.</p>

  <p>Six consummate True Gods guarded two sides of the tower.</p>

  <p>They played significant roles in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>The news of Nicholas' death had not spread to the Ray Tree, which was located at quite a distance from the Floating Island. The only shortcut here was the transmission array. So it was easy enough to keep the news a secret from them.</p>

  <p>But the principal members of the Dongfang Clan knew about it.</p>

  <p>"Master Pierson, what are you doing here?" the head of the guards asked, concerned. He had noticed the wound on Pierson's body.</p>

  <p>Lorena, Luo Zheng and the others emerged one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" the head of the guards asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>Pierson shook his head and said to him, "Nick, don't ask too many questions. Just show them the way."</p>

  <p>Nick frowned at how weak Pierson looked and refused to lead them inside.</p>

  <p>"Master Pierson, who are they? You know outsiders are not allowed to enter the Ray Tree!" Nick said coldly.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had held a dominant position for so many years. How could they allow ordinary people to break into the Ray Tree?</p>

  <p>It was hard to tell which cultivation base Lorena belonged to. Luo Zheng and Tianming were both consummate True Gods. Sword Chen, a Demi-holy Being, was the strongest among them.</p>

  <p>Nick thought they were too weak to run wild on the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>That was why he firmly refused Pierson's request.</p>

  <p>The six guards surrounded Luo Zheng and his companions with hostility.</p>

  <p>Lorena frowned and said to Pierson, "Tell them to behave themselves. Don't force me to kill them."</p>

  <p>She had been restraining herself ever since her return to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>And that was because Nicholas had fulfilled his promise by leaving the treasure body to her.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, she would have killed all the members of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>But now that she was in a hurry to see her husband, how could she waste time with these guards?</p>

  <p>"Nick, don't meddle in this. Just lead us to the Prison Island," Pierson commanded anxiously.</p>

  <p>But Nick was stubborn. He could tell there was something wrong with Pierson and looked at him more closely. "Master Pierson, as the guard of the transmission array, I will never allow people with unknown origins to break in. Even if Holy Nicholas were here, I would ask him..."</p>

  <p>Nick had barely finished speaking when a ray of crimson light pierced through his head.</p>

  <p>Before he could realize what was happening, he fell to the floor and rolled down the golden stairs of the tower with multiple clunks.</p>

  <p>Lorena raised her hand. Several spooky-looking lights crackled at her fingertips.</p>

  <p>The five remaining guards looked at Lorena, dumbfounded, their mouths wide open.</p>

  <p>Pierson closed his eyes, pain etched on his face, and said, "I told you not to ask too many questions."</p>

  <p>The people on the Ray Tree knew nothing of what had transpired on the Floating Island, and still thought themselves to be the most powerful. They didn't know that the Dongfang Clan had already declined.</p>

  <p>Iris clenched Tianming's hand and bit her lip. Watching a member of her clan die had caused her to pale. She was under great pressure.</p>

  <p>"Show me the way. One more word and I won't spare you," Lorena said coldly. She looked murderous.</p>

  <p>At this, the guards finally realized that Pierson had brought back some people who were probably unparalleled.</p>

  <p>They were quite confused.</p>

  <p>Why had these people broken into the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan and forced Pierson to take them to the Ray Tree?</p>

  <p>But since they were too weak to fight back, they could do nothing but obey Lorena and lead the way.</p>

  <p>The fall of Nick's body from the tower had attracted the attention of many members of the Dongfang Clan. They looked at him sullenly and unfriendly but dared not say anything more.</p>

  <p>The Ray Tree was so tall that if one were to jump from the top, it would take a few days for them to fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had established many transmission arrays throughout the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>The guards led Luo Zheng and his group into the transmission array that led to the Prison Island, a place where the Dongfang Clan imprisoned important prisoners.</p>

  <p>It sat at the bottom of the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>Some prisoners had betrayed the Dongfang Clan, and some had offended them.</p>

  <p>A prison cell stood at the center of the Prison Island, which was rather strange.</p>

  <p>It was, in fact, a half-dead person that was locked up in the cell.</p>

  <p>Every time this half-dead man came close to dying, a large array in the prison would be activated. This array contained the Life Divine Dao and would pour a little life force into the body of the half-dead man, making sure that he didn't die.</p>

  <p>The people of the Dongfang Clan knew that this prisoner was the Holy Being of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Killing a Holy Being was a complicated business. Both of his body and universe had to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan could not destroy the Evolutionary Universe now, which was why Mike had been imprisoned here.</p>

  <p>They would neither let him come back to life nor let him die, because once he died, he would soon be reborn in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan was not the first to use this way of imprisoning a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Soon, the group, led by Pierson, arrived at the prison gate.</p>

  <p>"Open the gate!" Pierson shouted.</p>

  <p>The two guards standing at the gate were only mid-rank True Gods. They dared not disobey Pierson's orders. They hurriedly opened the gate which creaked as it swung inwards.</p>

  <p>The gate had not been opened for many years and a strong, indescribable smell of blood spread through the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first to step inside, only to see a broken body lying at the center of a large emerald green array.</p>

  <p>It was none other than his father, Mike Luo.</p>
