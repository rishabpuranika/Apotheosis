<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After a while, Layla emerged from the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the beam of happiness was evident in her demeanor.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the space, her brother told her that he would be released in the near future? he promised to visit the Mist Palace right after to visit her. Their reunion day was just around the corner.</p>

  <p>As she walked out of the ancient hall, she turned to Luo Luo Zheng with a huge smile on her face. A kind of complacency and arrogance surfaced in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She was the only one to have passed the ultimate test in the Illusion Space trial.</p>

  <p>Although admittedly, her opponent's strength was far inferior to her older brother's.</p>

  <p>But she believed that it was merely Luo Zheng's bad luck that got him her brother as his opponent. While she might not have managed to beat Luo Luo Zheng in a one-on-one fight, the results proved, at the very least, that she had better luck than he did. A warrior's good luck was also a kind of strength, after all.</p>

  <p>In spite of her outward display of arrogance, Luo Luo Zheng merely nodded graciously in reply with a face that remained calm and expressionless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's indifferent reaction left Layla rather disappointed? shouldn't he have been frustrated after having been defeated by her brother and in turn losing to her in the trial? Why couldn't she find any signs of frustration on his face?</p>

  <p>Without the delight of relishing in Luo Zheng's frustration, Layla somehow felt unfulfilled. But when she thought about how soon she would be reunited with her brother, her mood shot up instantly.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng and Layla left the Illusion Space, the old man announced the warriors' rankings in the event, proceeding to hand out their respective awards.</p>

  <p>The Tribulation Exterminating Pills, the divine weapons, and the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pills?</p>

  <p>Most warriors from the thirteen palaces could at least get a Tribulation Exterminating Pill as a reward for participating in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Additionally, those who managed to reach 3, 000 miles in the Enchanted Barrier Tower could obtain a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>For warriors at their level, such a weapon was already a pretty good reward. But few of the warriors were qualified to receive it. Reaching 3, 000 miles in the tower was no easy feat? many people had been eliminated early on.</p>

  <p>After that, the old man recited another list of names.</p>

  <p>These were the names of the warriors who reached 10, 000 miles, all of whom were qualified to obtain a Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill.</p>

  <p>This batch of pills was easily more valuable than the secondary first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>And of course, both Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were on the list. After the group of warriors gathered around the old man, he pulled out a small jade pot and opened it up, emitting strands of icy, cold air.</p>

  <p>"The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill has special medicinal properties.</p>

  <p>Once it's taken out of the pot, these properties will volatilize almost instantly. After that, it will become an ordinary stone. Because of this, you must consume it as soon as you receive it from me," warned the old man.</p>

  <p>'What? I have to consume it right here and now?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt rather embarrassed.</p>

  <p>The pill was supposed to help warriors invoke their Heavenly Tribulations instantly, but this function was used mostly by warriors who had undergone nine Heavenly Tribulations? this would trigger invoking the tenth.</p>

  <p>Every warrior who had undergone ten Heavenly Tribulations would get a perfect Soul Sea. This was why all the races attached great importance to warriors at the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm. Such warriors did not only have a stronger foundation than most, but were also capable of opening up a perfect Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>The warriors around Luo Luo Zheng were either at the Soul Sea Realm or the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm? he could feel the embarrassment of the fact creep up his spine, making his mood sink.</p>

  <p>When Layla noticed Luo Zheng's expression, she smiled and asked, "Luo Luo Zheng, what about giving your pill to me? I want to try and see if consuming two pills in the row will invoke the eleventh Heavenly Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>But the old man gave her a sharp look before shaking his head and sighing in resignation.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the tenth Heavenly Tribulation the limit of the Life and Death Realm?" another warrior behind them chimed in. "Warriors can get a perfect Soul Sea after experiencing the tenth Heavenly Tribulation. I've never heard of the eleventh Heavenly Tribulation."</p>

  <p>Then, the old man interrupted them, "It's true that the tenth Heavenly Tribulation can contribute to the perfect Soul Sea. Nonetheless, there might be people in this world who indeed managed to invoke the eleventh Heavenly Tribulation."</p>

  <p>"The eleventh? Really?" asked a warrior in his astonishment.</p>

  <p>With a nod, the old man continued, "But as far as you're concerned, that exists only in stories. It has nothing to do with you. You can take your pills now!"</p>

  <p>With that, the old man lightly patted the icy jade pot. Numerous brown pills flew out from its opening and landed right in the warriors' hands.</p>

  <p>The pill was neither round nor square? it came in a strange, decahedral shape. The moment it landed in Luo Zheng's hand, he felt a slight chill. A bitter smile surfaced in his expression as he examined it.</p>

  <p>Because he was to go advance to the sixth level of the Life and Death Realm, consuming the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill right then was a waste for him.</p>

  <p>While it would have been convenient if he could store it, he had to consume it immediately before it lost its properties.</p>

  <p>"I can exchange a first-rank divine weapon for your Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill so you don't waste it. What do you think?" Layla walked over to Luo Zheng's side. In her mind, it was a rather good deal and he had no reason to refuse her.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng only shook his head and said with a smile, "Thank you, but I don't want to just give up this valuable pill even though it might be of no use for me."</p>

  <p>Although he didn't have many life vitality jades with him, he had many priceless treasures worth a great fortune. A first-rank divine weapon wasn't nearly enough to earn his interest.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's still up to you." Layla didn't attempt to force the deal.</p>

  <p>With that, all of the warriors consumed their Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pills, including Luo Luo Zheng as he stuffed the ice-cold pill into his mouth.</p>

  <p>The air in the Orange Sea World had rich vitality between heaven and earth. There were also many palace masters standing guard over it, making it conducive to accommodating the Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>The group of astounding warriors was then arranged in an open area. As soon as they were all settled, they sat down cross-legged at an equal distance from each other and began to digest the pills.</p>

  <p>While the pill was supposed to help them invoke their Heavenly Tribulations, it wasn't always managed with certainty? not all of them could experience their Heavenly Tribulations right there and then. The time the tribulations began for each warrior also differed from one another.</p>

  <p>The first one to start his Heavenly Tribulation was Javier, only five minutes after he consumed the pill.</p>

  <p>Because it was already his tenth Heavenly Tribulation, he would reach the Soul Sea Realm after he passed. After opening up his Soul Sea, his strength would increase significantly, securing him a place in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"I never would have expected Javier to start his tenth Heavenly Tribulation first. It seems like a formidable one!" someone in the crowd commented.</p>

  <p>"Did you really think he's an ordinary warrior? Come on, he's ranked third in the test of Law Storm! Without any rare genius like Luo Luo Zheng or Layla, he would have been ranked first!"</p>

  <p>"The Lotus Flower! His Lotus Flower appears! It's a Nine-petal Lotus Flower!"</p>

  <p>As they discussed, a faint image of a Lotus Flower appeared before floating over Javier's head in silence.</p>

  <p>The flower seemed to be in full bloom as it slowly spun in the air.</p>

  <p>Just as the other warriors had said, both Javier's talent and strength prevailed over most of the other young warriors in the entire alliance.</p>

  <p>While he should have attracted the crowd's attention, he paled in comparison to Luo Luo Zheng and Layla? they were just too exceptional.</p>

  <p>Neither the palace masters nor the Sunset World lord paid him any special attention.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>"It's a divine lightning!"</p>

  <p>"The Evil Fiery Poison!"</p>

  <p>"Look at the mist and shadows!"</p>

  <p>"This is indeed an extraordinary small Heavenly Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>As Javier began to undergo his tribulation, the small Heavenly Tribulation intensified.</p>

  <p>The palace masters looked perfectly calm as they watched from the sidelines. For warriors at their level, the power of such Heavenly Tribulation was nowhere near enough to make them budge.</p>

  <p>"Javier's tenth small Heavenly Tribulation is quite powerful. He will surely excel to the top after he reaches the Soul Sea Realm. I'm only curious as to how powerful Layla's tenth small Heavenly Tribulation will be," commented a palace master in a regulated, calm voice.</p>
