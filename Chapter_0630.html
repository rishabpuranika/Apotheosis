  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now it was clear why Felix had been so surprised.</p>

  <p>That being said, the Perfect Brushwork still appeared to be rather unremarkable in the cyan dragon's eyes. The upper world was just too vast and massive. Even amongst all of the various species, powers, and influences, talents almost seemed like they came a dime a dozen.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve excellency in the mastery of the divine texture, one must first become proficient in the basic skill called the Perfect Brushwork.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng managed to leave the cyan dragon quite amazed after finding out that he was able to comprehend the Perfect Brushwork within a span of just one day. That was also the main reason why the cyan dragon damned both Felix and Lasseter, referring to them as stupid idiots. They were nowhere near being qualified to give any remarks on the divine texture.</p>

  <p>Even though the cyan dragon was under the assumption that the Perfect Brushwork wasn't that big a deal, that wouldn't necessarily mean that Felix would also have the same point of view.</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter was that Felix wasn't really able to fully grasp the Perfect Brushwork. And it wasn't just him either. Of all the runic experts residing in the Central Region, none were able to get the hang of it.</p>

  <p>The Perfect Brushwork had been in existence for such a long time in the history of the Central Region, but that was almost eons ago. Two millennia prior to this day, a runic expert named Arnold Feng had unravelled the secrets of the Perfect Brushwork and activated the properties and energy of the materials while drawing the runes.</p>

  <p>Therefore, from that moment onwards, he became known as the "son of runes".</p>

  <p>Up until now, a huge portion of his works was still being kept by the people in the world. Of those works, the most famous piece of work was the sect protecting array belonging to the Ethereal Spirit Sect, making it the lone fifth-grade sect located in the Central Region. That sect protecting array was an outstanding example of Arnold Feng's masterful skills. Thanks to the sect protecting array, the Ethereal Spirit Sect was able to survive a string of catastrophic events and develop from a simple third-grade sect and end up being the strongest as well as the only fifth-grade sect in the Central Region at present.</p>

  <p>Ethereal Spirit Sect was able to become a fifth-grade sect, largely thanks to the verity that it was able to bring forth a number of gifted people from generation to generation. However, the sect protecting array was also a very significant component to that. If not anything else, it somehow sheltered the Ethereal Spirit Sect from being annihilated by a cataclysm.</p>

  <p>Arnold Feng had a lot of accomplishments under his belt. Of course, the sect protecting array surely wasn't the only surviving piece left in the world. There were numerous other rune fragments, a large portion of which had already been through the passage of time, therefore, there was no way for them to be activated ever again. Having said that, one could still say that there were still a lot of collectors enticed by them for the sole reason that they had been crafted by the renowned Arnold Feng.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, they could go for outrageous prices beneath the black market or possibly inside an auction.</p>

  <p>It seemed like Felix had been blessed with enough luck to be able to witness the Perfect Brushwork be performed once. It happened during the time when he went along with the head of the Cloud Hall to go for a visit on the Ethereal Spirit Sect. The Ethereal Spirit Sect was so eager to put on airs so they activated a small portion of their sect protecting array.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that he got extremely amazed by the Perfect Brushwork of Arnold Feng. Even at present day, he could still vividly see the scene playing out in front of him, making his heart start racing. It was a feeling filled with not just adulations, but most importantly, reverence toward the master who mastered the Perfect Brushwork.</p>

  <p>So when he finally laid his eyes on the execution of the Perfect Brushwork for a second time, he was so captivated by the meticulous Perfect Brushwork before his very eyes, somehow forgetting the fact that it had been done by Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Lasseter just stood there completely dumbfounded as he had no idea just what to make of it. He had a much too different perspective compared to Felix. As a trader, a merchant, of course he had heard of the Perfect Brushwork. Despite the fact that he had never seen it before himself, he was quite aware of how much the runes works of Arnold Feng were priced in the market even if they had already lost their effects.</p>

  <p>As one would expect, the runes constructed by Arnold Feng were being sold at such ridiculous rates only because of his fame. The Perfect Brushwork, on the other hand, seemed like it would be such a good selling point. And it could even be activated, so what more could one ask for?</p>

  <p>With a simple whistling noise, Felix shifted his gaze over to Luo Luo Zheng. Resting his hands on Luo Zheng's shoulders and shaking them, he enthusiastically asked him in high spirits, "Do...Do you know who created this meditation rune? Could you please tell me?"</p>

  <p>Watching Felix's behavior, Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes and glared at him intensely. 'Is this truly the mightiest runic expert at the Cloud Hall?</p>

  <p>Surely, he must be a fraud.' Luo Luo Zheng was in doubt. Then, he tried to reply as calmly as he could, "Would you please take your hands off me? I'll tell you once you let me go!"</p>

  <p>"Please forgive me. I'm sorry about that," Felix instantly loosened his grip and apologized. He realized that he was indeed acting impolitely.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he didn't really give a damn, for he must know the answer to his question. "So, now, would you mind telling me the name of the person who created this meditation rune?"</p>

  <p>Puckering his lips, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "Haven't I told you already a second ago? Weren't you listening?"</p>

  <p>"Who?" Felix and Lasseter asked simultaneously, clearly a bit confused.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt like he was about to lose his mind, because he honestly thought that he had already made it clear enough for them. Even the dumbest of people in the world would be able to figure out that he was talking about himself. Sadly, these two men were real birdbrains who couldn't understand that at all. Heaving a heavy sigh, he said, "This meditation rune was my own creation."</p>

  <p>Fixating their gaze upon Luo Luo Zheng, the two men promptly shook their heads almost instantaneously and blurted out in unison, "I don't believe you!"</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not, I couldn't care less. Boss, would you mind helping me appraise the worth of this meditation rune?" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't afford to waste any more time arguing with Felix right there. After all, he didn't owe him anything to indulge his curiosity.</p>

  <p>Squinting his eyes, Lasseter simply bobbed his head. Being the businessman that he was, he never really dwelled on stuff like doubting things presented in front of him. The only thing that mattered to him was how much it was going to sell, not who made it or where it came from.</p>

  <p>That was how the mindset of a businessman should always be.</p>

  <p>"Appraise? Evaluate? No, no, no, you can't just go on selling something like that!" Felix stopped Luo Luo Zheng in his tracks, much like a deranged man.</p>
