  <p>
</p>

  <p>Liusu, Aleyna and Kelsey were quite dear to everyone in the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Kelsey was the daughter of the master of the Han Clan while Liusu and Aleyna were the daughters of the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Everyone held them in high esteem.</p>

  <p>Zheng was of great assistance to the three girls therefore he didn't think of it as a big deal when they visited him. However, he didn't expect them to come one after another.</p>

  <p>Although Kelsey was a year younger than Aleyna, she was much more cunning than Aleyna was. As soon as her eyes fell on Joy who was sitting nearby, she bowed and said, "I'm so glad to see you, Aunt Joy. I missed you so much, so I came here today. Wow, you look much prettier than before."</p>

  <p>Joy smiled with delight. "You always have a sweet tongue, but I think that you didn't miss me and you didn't come to see me, right?"</p>

  <p>Kelsey was taken aback. "What do you mean? Aunt Joy," she stated nervously.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, let me guess. You are here because you want to give Tianxing a gift for he has helped you that day, right?" Joy asked joyfully.</p>

  <p>Kelsey hesitated but quickly regained her composure and said, "I'm just grateful that Tianxing helped me. I just wanted to thank him."</p>

  <p>Joy gave Kelsey a broad smile. "That's totally fine, but why didn't you all three come together?" she questioned.</p>

  <p>Kelsey was shocked when she heard what Joy had said. "Did Aleyna come here before me?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not only Aleyna but Liusu also paid him a visit," smiled Joy.</p>

  <p>This confused Kelsey.</p>

  <p>Liusu and Aleyna knew who Zheng really was but Kelsey was unaware of Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>She didn't know that Zheng had already met the two sisters in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. She even thought that Zheng had taught Keenan a lesson for her that day.</p>

  <p>Thus, this came as a bit of a shock to her that both the sisters visited Tianxing alone.</p>

  <p>Kelsey was able to hide her emotions and did not say much. She planned to take Tianxing to the Holy Emperor City which was under her father's control, in order to train him.</p>

  <p>However, her father held some grudges against Joy and since Tianxing belonged to the Purple Soul Hall, Joy had a keen liking for him. Thus, taking him to the Holy Emperor City would be an uphill task.</p>

  <p>Kelsey took out a blue necklace, which was the honoraria she had prepared for Zheng. It was a supreme primordial weapon which could protect one's soul from being hurt.</p>

  <p>Even though it was not a top-grade supreme primordial weapon, it was still of extreme value in the eyes of ordinary disciples of the Floating Islands. Kelsey gave the necklace to Zheng, thanked Joy for her hospitality and left.</p>

  <p>Joy sighed after Kelsey left and said, "She is unaware of your identity, I think."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Since Joy had guessed most of the truth, he had nothing to hide.</p>

  <p>"They all wanted to tell you something today but couldn't because of me," she blurted out. "Look, I won't interfere in your personal affairs, but after all, these girls are from my clan and if you break their hearts like your father did, you'd be severely dealt with."</p>

  <p>Joy's words caught Zheng by surprise. A figure started forming in his mind that maybe his father offended Joy somehow in the past. After all, Joy had become a Demi-holy Being for a long time, and before the Floating Island of the Luo Clan was in decline, his father was a Holy Emperor too.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't say much and kept his thoughts to himself.</p>

  <p>"So, Tianxing Luo isn't your real name, is it? What's your real name?" Joy questioned Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that Murphy had started a war in Mike's Evolutionary Universe. Joy had already figured out that Zheng changed his name in order to conceal his true identity.</p>

  <p>With his current level of cultivation, it would be quite impossible for him to escape once his identity was revealed.</p>

  <p>"My last name is Luo," Zheng replied nervously.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know." Joy threw Zheng a filthy look.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo," Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo?" she asked. Zheng nodded. She rummaged her thoughts and said, "Mike gave you a very ambitious name. He had once written an article about conquering heaven. I think he gave you the name from that article." (Zheng's Chinese name means conquering.)</p>

  <p>Zheng remained quiet. He was hoping that Joy would keep his identity a secret. It seemed that this Demi-holy Being was not hostile to him.</p>

  <p>Joy quickly changed the subject and said, "I witnessed the battles between you and the four True Gods. Your body is quite strong, and your soul is even stronger than that of most low-rank True Gods, although you killed your opponents with sheer brute force. I know you can easily defeat some low-rank True Gods but as you progress, you'd come to know that defeating the top talents of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands is much, much harder."</p>

  <p>Zheng was aware of the fact that Joy was right.</p>

  <p>In fact, a proving godly warrior could acquire a lot of extra points if they participated in the battle of challenging warriors at higher levels, but if they lost even a single battle, they would lose a considerable amount of points.</p>

  <p>Zheng could easily deal with the low-rank True Gods, but he knew that the task of facing the high-rank True Gods would be quite arduous.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't able to condense his Godly Tile, thus it became quite difficult for him to advance further. And he didn't dare to use the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Even if he participated as an anonymous man, his points would be included in the Han Clan's. Therefore, if his cultivating of the forbidden way was exposed, it was likely that he would be kicked out by the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>And Joy would never let Zheng condense the Godly Tile, if opportunity arose.</p>

  <p>Zheng had less than three months to accumulate enough points by fighting the warriors at higher levels in the Arena of Legends. If he was able to break through to the True God Realm, he would be challenging the warriors at the same level as him and he wouldn't be able to acquire a great deal of extra rewards.</p>

  <p>"It would be quite difficult for me to greatly enhance my strength in such a short period of time," Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>Joy gave him a warm smile and said, "My boy, it's not impossible at all.</p>

  <p>Close your eyes."</p>

  <p>Joy gently touched Zheng's forehead with her finger, and Zheng was surrounded by wisps of purple fog.</p>

  <p>Everything around Zheng vanished as he was hauled into some unknown world by Joy.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly opened his eyes. Much to his astonishment, the world as he knew was engulfed by a purple mist. Zheng saw snake-like enormous beasts wandering about. The beasts gave a cry of excitement when they saw Joy.</p>

  <p>Apart from these giant beasts, Zheng saw huge plants that were touching the sky. The leaves of these plants covered the sky and sun, and on the leaves hung countless purple bats.</p>

  <p>The purple bats were startled by the high-pitched screams of the snakes.</p>

  <p>They rattled their wings with annoyance as they prepared to fly.</p>

  <p>Everything appeared quite strange to Zheng.</p>

  <p>It felt as if Zheng was in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked Joy, "What place is this?"</p>

  <p>"Purple Sky Land. I built this universe." she beamed proudly.</p>

  <p>The Purple Sky Land was a special universe. Joy acquired the title of Demi-holy Being because of the Purple Sky Land, and if Joy further perfected the Purple Sky Land, she also had the opportunity to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"Why am I here?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I am unaware of where your strength came from, but I will teach you a method in the Might Godly Way, in this way you can exert your strength to the most extent. This cultivation method is mainly used by the True Gods who are able to condense the Nine Divine Stars. Although, you haven't activated a star yet, I believe that you would benefit from it a great deal."</p>

  <p>'It's for the True Gods who have Nine Divine Stars?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little stunned. Not only had he fully condensed out the Nine Divine Stars, they were also present in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Joy was unaware of the Primal Chaos Technique, and she was unaware that someone was quite skilled at it.</p>

  <p>After Holy Jay gave Zheng a large amount of strength source to gather nine stars, they automatically infused into Zheng's inner world. Before Zheng, only Holy Beings were able to merge the Nine Divine Stars with the universes.</p>
