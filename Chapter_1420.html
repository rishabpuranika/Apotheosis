<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warrior's blood colored robes flapped with the wind. Naturally, he could tell that the horse Luo Zheng rode was no ordinary one.</p>

  <p>The animal puzzled him at first glance, but once he sensed that the horse had the bloodline of a legendary beast, he was certain that this youth was riding the famous and precious Heavenly Phoenix Horse!</p>

  <p>It was known that martial artists couldn't travel fast enough across a supreme world if they only relied on their physical bodies to fly.</p>

  <p>It would still take a long time even for warriors of the Spirit Supreme Realm to travel across a supreme world through a space tunnel.</p>

  <p>There were a few ways to move through supreme worlds: by mastering the skill of spatial transference, by using top-rank treasures to fly, or by riding a legendary beast.</p>

  <p>For example, the Azure Smoke Bird and the Heavenly Phoenix Horse which Luo Zheng rode were legendary beasts which were of great help for warriors' travels.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult to capture a legendary beast; and even harder to suppress and tame one.</p>

  <p>The warrior's brows furrowed. The Heavenly Phoenix Horse the young man rode had actually been tamed...</p>

  <p>He clearly knew what a tamed Heavenly Phoenix Horse meant. It was likely something that even the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was keen to possess.</p>

  <p>If the warrior could get the Heavenly Phoenix Horse, he wouldn't use it for himself. It wasn't something someone of his level could own--but if he offered this legendary beast to someone with a higher rank, he would greatly benefit from it.</p>

  <p>As the warrior thought of it, the greed in his heart continuously entangled him like dark, black vines.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior was not a fool. It was impossible to capture such a creature in the wild. Even if they were strong enough to capture one, there was no way for them to tame it.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the young man once again. Since he possessed a domesticated Heavenly Phoenix Horse, he must've come from a powerful background.</p>

  <p>It was this very reason the warrior didn't choose to fight Luo Zheng directly and take his Heavenly Phoenix Horse away. Instead, his face softened as he said, "Freya, as your uncle, I have treated you well. Why did you run away like this?"</p>

  <p>Ever since Freya had chosen to escape with Luo Zheng, she knew that there was no turning back. "Uncle Julian, I've traveled far to reach here after I ascended to the Upper World, hoping to have your help in securing a better future for me. Alas, you will just make me a human cauldron, and sacrifice me to help someone in his cultivation. How could I willingly become someone else's human cauldron?" she said coldly.</p>

  <p>In turn, the warrior in blood red robes forced a smile. "Freya, you might have misunderstood me. I have strived hard in the Upper World. I can tell you from my experience that it is much more cruel here than you have imagined. It's not a bad thing to become a human cauldron... I wonder, who is this man behind you?" he said.</p>

  <p>In reality, the warrior in red wasn't interested in what Freya had to say; rather, he said those to get more information about the young man.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's heart and mind were as clear as a mirror. How could he not know this warrior's motives?</p>

  <p>"Freya and I ascended to the Upper World at the same time, and that was how we met. You're too vicious as an uncle. You even wanted to sacrifice your niece," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The warrior in red robes was truly shocked at Zheng's words!</p>

  <p>Was he actually an ascended warrior?</p>

  <p>The warrior in blood red robes was also an ascended warrior. He had relied only on himself to become a lord of one of the thirty-six thousand cities in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place all these years, so he could be considered as someone with real power.</p>

  <p>However, he was actually far from being a big shot in the entire Spiritual Force Sacred Place--but it didn't deter him from being ambitious!</p>

  <p>And now that this young man was someone who ascended to this place, it made matters much easier...</p>

  <p>He had been originally cautious in case that Luo Zheng might have a powerful background. Now that he no longer had any doubts about him, the smile on his face gradually faded.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha boy, I'm her uncle and I will take care of her. As an ascended warrior, I'll warn you not to meddle in other people's affairs, as doing so often comes with a heavy price!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cocked an eyebrow and decided to play dumb and ignorant. "What price?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The price of life," the warrior in red sighed and shook his head. Then, he turned around and gently waved at his men.</p>

  <p>The warrior in red's cultivation was at the late stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm. In his eyes, a kid at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm like Luo Zheng wasn't worth his effort to deal with. Thus, he gave his men the order and they all rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puff puff puff puff puff puff…</p>

  <p>The moment the warrior in red robes turned to face Luo Zheng, he heard muffled sounds from behind him. His head whipped to side, then he saw his six men thrown like rag dolls into the Bright Sky City.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng still wore an innocent smile on his face as he asked, "What price?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the warrior in red robes widened in shock. A warrior at just the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm had instantly killed six warriors at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm! The faint smile on the warrior's face froze. This young man's strength had completely exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>Was it even possible for a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm to have such strength?</p>

  <p>The warrior in red robes looked at his dead men covered in dust, then to the sword in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>His eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he sensed the Thunder Wind Divine Sword's Mu Ning! The sword was at least a secondary first-rank divine weapon... no, no, it was most likely a first-rank divine weapon!</p>

  <p>At that point, it was clear to the warrior in red robes that Luo Zheng wasn't an ordinary person, from his mount which was a Heavenly Phoenix Horse to his first-rank divine weapon! Even the Spiritual Force Sacred Place's core talents didn't have such first-class equipment.</p>

  <p>Was this young man really just someone who had ascended to the Upper World?</p>

  <p>Freya had ascended not too long ago, so it was impossible for her to have met anyone important. This young man before him had a high chance of being an ascended warrior. Hell, he'd even frankly admitted it!</p>

  <p>The question was, did ordinary ascended warriors possess such strength?</p>

  <p>And, a first-rank divine weapon?</p>

  <p>If the warrior in blood red robes calmed down, then he might stop and reconsider. If he offended someone of a much higher status, he would be doomed. The warrior had been alive for so long, so there was no reason for him to not understand this logic.</p>

  <p>It was just that Zheng's sword and the Heavenly Phoenix Horse behind him posed the greatest temptations.</p>

  <p>Even if the warrior was the lord of the Bright Sky City, any treasures of Luo Zheng were things that he could never possess in his lifetime, no matter how hard he strived.</p>

  <p>Murder and theft were common deeds in the world of martial artists.</p>

  <p>Thus, greed had gotten the better of the warrior's mind.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a strange glint in Freya's eyes as she sat on the Heavenly Phoenix Horse. Ever since she had met this young man Luo Zheng, she had always been in for a surprise. She couldn't see through his strength at all! However, the light in her eyes dimmed a bit when she thought about her uncle's cultivation, which was at the Spirit Supreme Realm. No matter how powerful Luo Zheng was, he probably couldn't beat her uncle.</p>

  <p>The warrior in blood red robes gazed at Luo Zheng for a while then said,</p>

  <p>"Interesting... But your strength isn't enough..."</p>

  <p>After that, a violent and malicious Mu Ning shot out from the warrior and spread out like a tide. The weaker martial artists and the many mortals in the entire Bright Sky City all trembled in fear under the pressure. The majority of them didn't even dare raise their heads.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm warriors watched the battle in the sky from a corner of the city.</p>

  <p>"The lord of the Bright Sky City actually came down personally to fight!"</p>

  <p>"Why does his opponent seem to be a kid who has just entered the Soul Sea Realm?"</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate that young man. He has instantly defeated six warriors at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm! Is he a core talent from a sacred place?"</p>

  <p>In the battle, a mass of constantly boiling blood rose up from the warrior's hands. It swirled continuously until it gradually formed into a blood red long spear.</p>

  <p>He waved the blood red spear for a bit, then pointed it at Luo Zheng. "You'll soon know the price you have to pay!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face hardened at that moment, and he didn't say another word. This was his first time to face a Spirit Supreme Realm master. As he lightly swung the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, a ray of lighting and a wind blade crossed paths with each other. On the other hand, Nether God Shadows rushed towards the warrior in blood red robes from different directions.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" the warrior in red shouted.</p>

  <p>The blood red spear quickly shot out several times. Each strike had successfully hit Zheng's Nether God Shadows and shattered them!</p>

  <p>But he wasn't finished. After he broke Zheng's Nether God Shadows, his long spear charged straight towards Luo Zheng, like a cyan dragon that dove into the depths of the sea.</p>
