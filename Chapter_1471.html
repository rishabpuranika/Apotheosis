<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1471 A Whirlpool </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The dark abyss was illuminated by strings of lightning segments intertwined with each other, which formed a single thick lightning bolt that hung in the abyss.</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Luo Zheng touched the lightning bolt, a thunderous roar erupted from the abyss, accompanied by explosions of 30 to 40 feet wide balls of lightning.</p>

  <p>The lightning balls were terrifyingly powerful. The Thunder Law inside them had broken through the limit of the fifth layer, and had reached a degree which Luo Luo Zheng couldn't understand anymore.</p>

  <p>Such was its tremendous power, that even Luo Zheng's divine weapon body found it hard to resist.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng still sped downwards with gritted teeth. He had reached his speed's limit, so it was impossible for him to stop even if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A lighting ball exploded under Luo Zheng's feet. Blazing white light erupted from the explosion and shone harshly upon Luo Zheng's eyes, followed by a huge force of impact which began to press down on him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As a result, the huge impact stopped Luo Zheng's descent, and he was sent flying high up while his whole body spun in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng soon stabilized his body after that disastrous incident, but a stream of blood flowed from the corner of his lips.</p>

  <p>"This is too dangerous!" he mumbled.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows twisted into a slight frown, but he didn't look deterred in the slightest. He used the momentum of his descent to charge downwards once again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xun was beside him and saw everything. Her usually cold face was warmed up by a faint smile as she floated behind Luo Luo Zheng. She closed her eyes, and let her pure white arms pass through his underarms.</p>

  <p>Her sharp wings formed by the Faith Energy then began to bend constantly. The wings not only wrapped around her, but Luo Zheng's whole body as well.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" she ordered.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng was under Xun's protection now, the speed of his descent suddenly increased several times.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, thick lightning strands were repeatedly triggered. The number of exploding lightning balls in the abyss also increased as violent rumbling sounds echoed throughout.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the lightning balls couldn't penetrate the wings, no matter how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they had descended all the way down, and there was no obstruction.</p>

  <p>After they passed through the area filled with thunder balls, they were next greeted by thunder spirits with their own will.</p>

  <p>The thunder spirits looked strangely adorable as they floated about in the abyss. They sometimes even let out soft cries, as if they were pets that could be adopted.</p>

  <p>But despite their cute appearances, the thunder spirits had immense powers. Back then when Xun was still at the Spirit Supreme Realm, she chose to leave the abyss because of the thunder spirits.</p>

  <p>While Xun could already use the Faith Energy at that time, she could only use a small part of it.</p>

  <p>Xun's arms wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng as they continued descending head first, but the thunder spirits gathered together and began to launch a series of attacks.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>

  <p>The thunderous crack of the turbulent lightning energy surged again, but Xun's wings were indestructible. The thunder spirits didn't get to dodge in time, so they collapsed and disappeared in the collision.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He suddenly thought that something was strange.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon had previously eaten quite a bit of the Faith Energy. However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't realize how powerful the Faith Energy was at that time.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng finally understood. While Xun was still only a remnant soul and her soul had only recovered about sixty percent as of now, normal world lords were still weren't a match for her if she used all of her Faith Energy. She was even on par with a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>But if what Xun said just now was true, then Yao had a way to cut off her ability to extract Faith Energy. It looked like Xun wouldn't be able to use her mysterious and immense power for quite some time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Five minutes was all it took for Luo Luo Zheng to pass through the fifth lap of the Endless Abyss, which was faster than the time it took him in the fourth lap.</p>

  <p>It didn't take much long for Luo Luo Zheng to finally see the bottom of the abyss.</p>

  <p>From there he saw a deep, quiet valley which was surrounded by strange plants. Although there wasn't much light, the plants still looked lush.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng fell deeper into the valley, his body suddenly twisted and then he landed firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Xun's wide wings retracted and condensed into twelve blades which neatly folded themselves on her back. They now looked like a pair of smaller wings.</p>

  <p>"Is this valley the end of the Endless Abyss?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He felt miniscule as he took in the quietness and his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Back then, he would always find a cave every time he circled a lap of the Endless Abyss. According to the rules, there should also be a cave at the end of the valley.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, something flashed in Xun's eyes. Two blades on her back suddenly separated from her body, and then hacked at the plants at an extremely fast speed as they circled in the air.</p>

  <p>Numerous plants at the bottom of the valley were cut into pieces. It wasn't long before the valley became empty. Then, a small cave came into view at the valley's side.</p>

  <p>This cave was much smaller compared to the previous ones.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng kept to himself and didn't ask Xun. It was because she had never been in this place before, so she naturally didn't know what was in the cave.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Luo Luo Zheng walked towards the cave. Xun floated behind him with eyes filled with curiosity. After all, she'd never reached this cave before. Thus, she wanted to know the mysteries behind it, now that she was here with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just who was the Supreme Lord from remote ages? Why did he need to build such an underground palace? What kind of inheritance could Luo Luo Zheng obtain?</p>

  <p>The cave was quite narrow, so Xun's blade-like wings shrunk again into a small, spider-shaped pattern that attached itself to Xun's back.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy was completely under Xun's control, as well as the shape it could transform into.</p>

  <p>Their slight footsteps echoed against the rocky walls as Luo Luo Zheng led the way.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they reached a stone house. It was clearly built by removing the inner part of the cave. Its walls were straight and there was even a stone bed inside.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing on the stone bed except for a thick pile of dust.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the bed used to have something on it, like bed sheets. If a divine weapon wouldn't be able to withstand a hundred million years of corrosion, then ordinary things would probably just degrade into a pile of dust.</p>

  <p>No matter how Luo Luo Zheng looked the house, it was just an ordinary stone house to him. Even a warrior could build one in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes fell on one corner of the stone house. "There's a back door," she said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in response, and opened the door as Xun requested.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng pushed the door open, a strong gravitational force tugged at him.</p>

  <p>Xun felt it too, and wanted to stabilize her body and resist it at first.</p>

  <p>However, she was shocked when the force had dragged her easily through the small door. She realized that even if she borrowed the Faith Energy, it was useless against this strong pull.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Both of them now stood beside each other in an unknown space, which was filled with countless stars of various sizes.</p>

  <p>"So many stars... Is this an Illusion Space?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. The magnificent stars looked like twinkling lamps as Luo Luo Zheng marveled at them.</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head and said, "It's not an Illusion Space. Our bodies were pulled inside this place, but the Illusion Space is just a projection."</p>

  <p>"These stars seem to be different from the stars in the universe," Luo Luo Zheng murmured as he gazed at them.</p>

  <p>He had cultivated the Stellar Body, which required him to observe the stars every day. Thus, he was quite familiar with them. While it was impossible for him to count all the stars in the universe, he was sure that the constellations in it weren't arranged in this way.</p>

  <p>The stars arranged themselves in an orderly manner in front of them.</p>

  <p>They looked like a huge whirlpool, which revolved around the center.</p>
