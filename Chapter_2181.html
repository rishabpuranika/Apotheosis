  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood on the spot while his body was still in a tense state. As cold sweat trickled down his back, his chest continued to heave non-stop.</p>

  <p>If the lightning ball descended another foot, he would also use his token to defend himself.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was well aware that the Thousand Commandments Slate was powerful enough to kill a top-rank True God. With his current level of cultivation, resistance would be futile.</p>

  <p>Because of that accident, Luo Luo Zheng had been caught off guard and almost gotten killed. If he had really died in the Six-Burden Divine City, it would have been too much for him to accept. He still hadn't achieved his ambition.</p>

  <p>Before the ball of lightning disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng saw a red light leap out from a corner of the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't sure what that red light was, the disappearance of the lightning ball must have something to do with the red light. Curiosity became apparent in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>He turned his head and saw a girl in green clothes standing at the corner.</p>

  <p>She had a simple ponytail that revealed her pure white neck. Her chubby face was filled with a delicate Mu Ning. Even though it was in a ponytail, the girl's hair was still long enough to hang down her heels.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the only one who focused on the girl. The attention of everyone in the courtyard was also stolen by her.</p>

  <p>Some of the young proving godly warriors' eyes lit up as they saw the girl. Their hearts thumped in their chests. Curious expressions could be seen on the faces of the proving godly warriors. No matter where she appeared, she would definitely attract countless gazes. Nonetheless, none of the warriors had noticed her before this moment.</p>

  <p>As for the people of the Han Clan, including the True Gods, their attention was naturally not on the girl herself, but on her hand.</p>

  <p>The girl's hand was fair and exquisite without a single wrinkle. In that hand, there was a token. On the token was a large "Veto" word. It was the Han Clan's Veto Token.</p>

  <p>Malloy held his breath, and then let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>He'd thought that Luo Luo Zheng was about to perish just now. He hadn't thought that this girl would make a move at that moment. The recent events had been beyond his expectations. A mixture of surprise and relief was seen on his face.</p>

  <p>Malloy also didn't know the girl. However, he knew that she was someone extraordinary. Of course, how could someone with a Veto Token be an ordinary person? With a few conjectures in his mind about the girl's background, Malloy approached her. A respectful expression appeared on his face as he cupped his hands towards her. He then said in a humble tone, "Young lady, thank you very much for saving him just now."</p>

  <p>The girl's bright eyes blinked as she looked at Malloy. She then waved her hand. "There's no need to thank me. Moreover, I saved him, so he should be the one thanking me."</p>

  <p>Malloy immediately agreed. "That's right. Tianxing Luo, this lady used the Veto Token to save your life. I think you should thank her." Malloy guessed that this girl was most likely from the Han Clan on the Floating Island. As for why she wanted to return to the ancestral land of the Han Clan and participate in the examination of Heavenly Han House, he had no idea. Regardless of her motives, he still paid her the necessary respect.</p>

  <p>Additionally, none of the people who had returned from the Floating Island could be neglected.</p>

  <p>When he heard Malloy's words, Luo Luo Zheng also clasped his hands together towards the girl. In a gentle tone, he thanked her, "Thank you, young lady, for saving my life."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at Luo Luo Zheng and raised the Veto Token that had already been used. An impish smile came across her face. She then said in a playful tone, "I heard that this token is worth a lot of money. I saved your life, so how are you going to repay me?"</p>

  <p>The reason she returned to the ancestral land of the Han Clan was to offer sacrifices to the ancestors.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan had already survived for countless years. Due to their ancient existence, they had long since become a great power. However, the Han Clan was also very complicated. Every ten thousand years, all the members of the clan would go to the ancestral land to offer sacrifices to the ancestors together. Aside from that, the members of the Han Clan on the Floating Island would usually return to the ancestral land alone.</p>

  <p>It was the first time the girl had left the Floating Island. As such, everything in the Six-Burden Region was new to her. In the short time that she left the Floating Island, she had already toured the entirety of the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>However, what left her with the deepest impression was still the scene where Eric challenged Luo Luo Zheng in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. Luo Zheng's magnificent display of strength was deeply engraved in her memory.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Bruce told her not to have any expectations for the proving godly warriors in the Han Clan's ancestral land. He said that although the divine land was vast, there was a huge gap between the strengths of warriors from outside the Floating Islands and warriors from the Floating Islands. The proving godly warriors were merely a little bit better than the divine citizens in the eyes of the warriors from the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Proving godly warriors from the Floating Islands could easily kill the proving godly warriors from outside the Floating Islands. The same was true for True Gods, no matter low-rank True Gods or mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, the bit of strength that Luo Luo Zheng displayed in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant was enough to completely refute Bruce's point of view. Just that bit of strength that Luo Luo Zheng displayed was enough to instantly kill ninety percent of proving godly warriors on the Han Clan's Floating Island. As such, a curious expression could be seen on the girl's face as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Both the girl and Bruce knew that with Luo Zheng's skillful control over strength, his true abilities were on a higher level. Wouldn't such a person be able to match up to the true geniuses of the Han Clan?</p>

  <p>Therefore, she became interested in Luo Luo Zheng. However, Bruce didn't let her interfere in this matter and said he would send people to investigate Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the end, she couldn't change his mind, so she could only give up.</p>

  <p>After she offered sacrifices to the ancestors, she still had plenty of time.</p>

  <p>A thought then entered her mind. The test of the Heavenly Han House was very lively. She begged Bruce to give her a spot, and quietly entered the Heavenly Han House. Before this, Bruce had even used the Mask Technique on her.</p>

  <p>After the Mask Technique was cast, a person's temperament was concealed. As long as she was in a crowd, she would not stand out at all.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for others to notice her presence.</p>

  <p>As a result, when she entered the Heavenly Han House, no one had noticed that there was such a girl in the corner.</p>

  <p>After she stayed in the Heavenly Han House for a while, she saw Luo Luo Zheng slowly walk in. When Luo Luo Zheng broke his token, she was quite impressed.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't expect that when he threw the black short halberd out, it actually triggered the Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>Of course, the girl understood very well the power of the Thousand Commandments Slate. Once the punishment from the slate was dealt with Luo Luo Zheng, he would definitely die. She already had wanted to use her Veto Token to help him. However, when she heard that Malloy had asked Elder Chen to use his Veto Token, she immediately gave up on the idea.</p>

  <p>Never would she have thought that at the most crucial moment, Elder Chen would say that his Veto Token was not by his side. A mix of shock and anger crept upon the girl's heart for such a slow response from Elder Chen.</p>

  <p>Thus, the girl fiercely glared at Elder Chen as she silently cursed in her heart, 'Why didn't you say it earlier?' Only then did she activate her Veto Token to reject the punishment of the Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>With quick action, Luo Luo Zheng was saved.</p>

  <p>"How am I going to repay you?" Luo Luo Zheng was startled and suddenly had a strange feeling. A confused look was seen on his face.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how to respond, Malloy quickly said from the side, "We still have a few Veto Tokens. After the exam, we'll have someone send them to you. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>However, the girl shook her head. She said in a playful tone, "The Veto Tokens are easy to obtain. I don't care about them at all. I saved his life, so according to the rules, his life counts as mine? So he's my man, right?"</p>

  <p>When these words came out from the innocent girl's mouth, everyone was stunned.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also speechless. With his strength, he was brave enough to fight most opponents. However, he was useless against such twisted logic.</p>

  <p>To save a warrior's life was definitely a huge favor. However, it didn't mean that the life that was saved belonged to the savior.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that this girl had left the Floating Island. As such, she was originally very clueless about worldly affairs. Bruce followed and took care of her along the way, and she hadn't caused any trouble. As Bruce didn't enter the Heavenly Han House, the girl became alone. With an innocent look on her face, she had begun to cause trouble.</p>
