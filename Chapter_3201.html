<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>An uncomfortable silence hung in the air after Gant said those words to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a talented warrior who was capable of Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p id="top_23">Moreover, he had Athemar's support. That being said, this made it difficult for the people of the Vastness Mountain to get back at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, Gant was aware that his clan was trying to be cautious. After all, the Su Clan was but a weapon refining clan; they bore little to no importance to the Oneness Sky Palace. They couldn't afford to provoke the people of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Gant surveyed the elders before him. They, as well as the other people of the Su Clan, all looked quite surprised.</p>

  <p>The people started to whisper amongst themselves. "Zheng is capable of Instant Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>"Only fourteen people could do that in the history of the Oneness Sky Palace!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder Zheng was so confident and did not hesitate to kill Marco."</p>

  <p>"Fine," Zheng said quietly. He knew Gant was constantly trying to please him.</p>

  <p>"Now, do we still need to continue fighting?"</p>

  <p>Zheng took a look at his surroundings. His battle with Marco dealt a lot of damage to the battle ring. Huge cracks dotted the drums.</p>

  <p>The other clans like the Li Clan and the Zhao Clan were also quiet. They were unwilling to fight because they knew very well that none of their young warriors could match Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>Also, the battle that just took place was truly gruesome. None of the clans was in the mood to compete with each other.</p>

  <p>All the clan masters gathered together to discuss. Finally, they decided that the Su Clan should take control of the Ripple Pavilion.</p>

  <p>And with that, the gathering at the Ripple Pavilion came to an end. Despite everything that happened, Zheng ended up helping the Su Clan reach their goal; he owed them nothing.</p>

  <p>Zheng packed up and left with Gant.</p>

  <p>Cailen watched their receding figures. He was a little worried about Gant, but he dared not say anything in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Su City, Zheng and Gant decided to walk westward, along the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>Although much had happened in the competition this year, the gathering at the Ripple Pavilion pushed through, unaffected.</p>

  <p>Throngs of people talked excitedly amongst themselves by the banks of the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>Many couldn't get over Zheng's heroic stunt today. In their eyes, the battles between Zheng and Marco, Zheng and the three brothers were the highlight, despite many other battles not even having taken place yet.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, Trish is your maid, but she is too unruly," Gant complained.</p>

  <p>"She should have come back when the Ripple Pavilion rally began, but she didn't," Gant huffed indignantly while trailing closely behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>The day after Zheng arrived at the Su Clan's mansion, Trish asked if she could leave for a while. She had wanted to go back home; this was why she came to the Clear Lake with Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, she hadn't come back yet. Gant decided to take Zheng to the Yan-Zhao City to look for her.</p>

  <p>In the Yan-Zhao City lived two big clans: the Yan Clan and the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>However, over time, the Yan Clan grew weak, and gradually deteriorated.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the Zhao Clan took full control of the city.</p>

  <p>During this time of festivities, the Yan-Zhao City was brightly lit with colorful lanterns tied to the roofs of the buildings.</p>

  <p>However, the cheery festivities ended at the northwest corner where a dilapidated house sat. This was the Yan Clan's ancestral home.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from the backyard of the Yan Clan's house, Trish gritted her teeth as she tried to search for a way out.</p>

  <p>She had promised to go back to the Su Clan's mansion today to meet Zheng, but now she was trapped in her own house.</p>

  <p>Many times she attempted to climb over the courtyard wall, but every time her fingers touched the bricks, a ray of dark, scarlet blood light would shoot at her. She turned a somersault and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Trish, just quit." A voice came from within the house. "This enchanted barrier was personally set up by the Zhao Clan. It's impossible to get out."</p>

  <p>From the shadows, Trish's stepmother emerged.</p>

  <p>"How could you treat me like this? I have given you many divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>Trish spat with resentment.</p>

  <p>Her stepmother shrugged. "To rebuild our clan, the divine crystals you earn are far from enough!" She smiled in a sinister manner. "If you marry into the Zhao Clan, they may help us."</p>

  <p>"How can you possibly think that?! That's just wishful thinking! Lachlan is a playboy. I, I would rather die than marry him!" Trish said, unable to fight back the tears from streaming down her face. She had done so much for her family, but her stepmother was trying to force her to marry into the Zhao Clan! Her heart broke.</p>

  <p>The Yan Clan had also been influential in the past. However, twenty years ago, the elders of the Yan Clan had all passed away. This left only a group of women and children to fend for themselves, with no one to rely on.</p>

  <p>While their power declined over the years, the Zhao Clan's influence increased rapidly. Gradually, they took over the business of the Yan Clan, eventually taking over the whole city.</p>

  <p>"Don't make things difficult for me," her stepmother replied unsympathetically. "Young Master Lachlan will come to pick you up tonight. You can't go anywhere else today." As she spoke, she heard the floorboards in the house creak with footsteps.</p>

  <p>A man garbed in white emerged, followed by a few servants dressed in black.</p>

  <p>"Young Master Lachlan, you're here! Is the Clear Lake bustling? Hee hee."</p>

  <p>Trish's stepmother attempted to greet him with an ingratiating smile.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's bustling," Lachlan said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Lachlan wasn't an ambitious man. He wasn't strong enough to fight for the Zhao Clan at the gathering. Moreover, with the great accident that happened earlier today, the battles had come to a hasty end.</p>

  <p>After the curt greetings, Trish's stepmother led Lachlan to the backyard, where Trish sat, seething.</p>

  <p>Lachlan's eyes lit up the moment he saw Trish. With a grin, he said, "Trish!</p>

  <p>I haven't seen you in years. You grow more and more beautiful each time I see you. It seems that the Oneness Sky Palace treats you well."</p>

  <p>He stepped forward and gently touched Trish's face.</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>Without a word, Trish had slapped his hand away, her eyes brimming with anger.</p>

  <p>Lachlan looked back at Trish's stepmother with surprise. "Have you made everything clear to her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have told her everything," Trish's stepmother said, beaming. "Trish, don't worry! Young Master Lachlan will treat you well after you become his concubine."</p>

  <p>"Listen," Trish said coldly, "I came back with my master this time. You can't afford to offend him. If..."</p>

  <p>"Trish!" her stepmother sneered. "Do you really want to be a maid for the rest of your life?"</p>

  <p>Lachlan frowned scornfully. "Your master is just a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace. Do you really think he can beat my clansmen? Even if he were to visit me in my house, I wouldn't be afraid of him!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand with disdain and said, "Tie her up and take her back. I will teach her a lesson once we get back."</p>

  <p>The servants gave a curt nod and then walked towards Trish.</p>

  <p>Trish's eyes darted back and forth between the servants approaching her. In her desperation, she took a few steps back and leaned against the wall.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she felt her hand grow warm.</p>

  <p>It felt as though a force was controlling her arm; as the first servant finally reached her, the next thing she knew was her hand suddenly flailed forward.</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>The servant in the front flew more than a hundred feet away at the impact of Trish's slap.</p>

  <p>When the others saw this, they froze. Lachlan was also stunned. "Are you all cowards? Get her!"</p>

  <p>The servants summoned up courage and rushed at Trish again, this time more fiercely determined.</p>

  <p>Trish felt like a god was helping her. She lunged forward suddenly, her hands flailing uncontrollably. Yet, she managed to hit the servants square in the face, sending them flying.</p>

  <p>Slap! Slap! Slap!</p>

  <p>Crisp slaps were heard one after another. After a while, all the servants lay unconscious on the ground.</p>

  <p>Trish looked at her hands in shock.</p>

  <p>Lachlan narrowed his eyes. He felt something strange, like an invisible force was running around the courtyard. "Who is it? Who is there? Get out!"</p>
