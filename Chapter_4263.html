<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was growing more and more upset as he realized that he would be unable to return home.</p>

  <p>Ziya went into the cave to look around. He bent and broke off a stone at the edge of the crack.</p>

  <p>Then he drilled out of the cave, and handed the stone to Geoffrey. "Here.</p>

  <p>Use your spiritual sense to check if there is anything special about this stone."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey probed the stone with his spiritual sense. After several moments, he shook his head. Without saying anything, he sent his spiritual sense into the cave, exploring the stones, cracks, plants, and even bugs hiding underground in the cave.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that the large chaos can run away!"</p>

  <p>He leapt upwards, rising into the sky.</p>

  <p>He focused, closing his eyes, and allowed his spiritual sense to spread out as far as it could go.</p>

  <p>Like an invisible cloud, Geoffrey's spiritual sense cloaked the surrounding woods, rocks, and bodies of water.</p>

  <p>It flowed out for a mile, then ten miles, then a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Everything within that boundary, regardless of size, was captured by Geoffrey's spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>A few minutes passed. Eventually, Geoffrey opened his eyes and slowly descended. Unable to conceal his worry, he said, "I have explored everything within a hundred miles, including seven secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>One of them is the world of poisonous mist that we once entered..."</p>

  <p>"Let's check them one by one," said Ziya.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded. Together, he and Ziya began traveling through the woods. This place was located at the edge of the main world. The seven secondary worlds had been built as experiments, and widely distributed.</p>

  <p>The first secondary world they entered was completely dark. After roaming around for a while in pitch blackness, the two of them retreated.</p>

  <p>The next secondary world was obscured by heavy mists.</p>

  <p>Likewise, there seemed to be nothing of note in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>Several hours had passed. They were down to the final secondary world.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey and Ziya were silent. They crossed a long, narrow mountain range and found another cave. They glanced at each other, aware that this was the last world to explore, then entered the mouth of the cave.</p>

  <p>As soon as they stepped into the cave, they felt a gust of freezing wind blow over their bodies. This world was a land of ice and snow.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey sighed. "This is not the chaos. Let's leave," he said.</p>

  <p>However, just as they took a last look around the cave, preparing to leave, there was a sudden cracking sound from behind them. They turned swiftly. The sound had come from the flash freezing of ice water? the mouth of the cave was covered entirely with a thick layer of ice. The entrance was blocked. The two of them stared at the barrier and saw that there were faint dark shadows embedded in the depths of the ice.</p>

  <p>"Is this a trap?" Ziya asked quietly, looking around him with renewed alertness.</p>

  <p>He held the God Lashing Whip firmly in his hand.</p>

  <p>He lifted his arm and sent countless golden whip shadows towards the ice.</p>

  <p>As the golden whips slashed into the ice blocking the cave entrance, shards of crystal clear ice scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>In general, Ziya was quite confident in his own strength. After all, he was one of the top masters in the third-grade world. How could a mere layer of ice stand in his way?</p>

  <p>However, this was no ordinary ice. It condensed with a swiftness that defied the imagination. Indeed, as he lashed at the ice, it seemed to be growing thicker and thicker.</p>

  <p>Outside the wall of ice, two giants stood at the entrance of the cave. The two enormous creatures, like Pompeo, belonged to the Colossus race.</p>

  <p>However, there was at least one major difference. Unlike Pompeo, these two giants had purple crystals inserted along the length of their backs. The purple crystals lined their spines from the waist to the nape of the neck.</p>

  <p>The giants were busy emptying their pockets. They were taking out dark blue ice runes, slapping them one after another on the surface of the ice.</p>

  <p>Every time they placed down an ice rune, a wave of energy emanated from it, and the wall of ice grew thicker.</p>

  <p>One of the giants snorted with laughter, as he looked at the shadowy form of Ziya and his golden whip through the ice. "The two mice scurried in and now they are trapped and want to come out. Our master was right," he said, smirking.</p>

  <p>"Their strength is not too bad. What's more, they can freely move in the fourth-grade world. Fortunately, our master has loyal servants like us. We won't lose to them," the other giant said, slapping down more ice runes.</p>

  <p>Ziya, who was in the secondary world, didn't know what was going on in the outside world. Golden thorns began to protrude on the surface of his God Lashing Whip.</p>

  <p>"Thorny Whip!" he cried.</p>

  <p>The whip lashed through the air and made a cracking sound as the thorns pierced the ice.</p>

  <p>Ziya was doing his best.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had needed to rely on Geoffrey in order to deal with those tentacles. He knew it would be extremely embarrassing to be forced to ask Geoffrey for help again.</p>

  <p>However, even though he had unleashed all of his power, the ice withstood the force of his attacks. It seemed to be getting thicker and thicker.</p>

  <p>The Abstruse Energy World was full of low-level creatures, and they simply didn't have the ability to create such a solid ice layer. This didn't make any sense.</p>

  <p>While Ziya hesitated, wondering what to do next, Geoffrey came and stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it," he said.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey put his hand on the ice and hit it hard with his open palm.</p>

  <p>He didn't use any special skills. He simply channeled all his considerable physical strength into the blow.</p>

  <p>The huge ice layer vibrated from the force of the slap. The ice became opaque, turning from a translucent blue to a cloudy snow white color as countless splinters and cracks formed and spread. After a couple of seconds, there was a deafening bang as the ice shattered and shards sprayed out like water rushing from a dam.</p>

  <p>The two giants standing outside were completely caught off guard. They hadn't expected such a display of strength. Even as they stuck ice runes into the wall, it exploded outwards, and they were carried away by the massive amounts of ice debris.</p>

  <p>The giants struggled to get up. When they finally raised their heads, they saw Geoffrey floating above them.</p>

  <p>"Who sent you here? Tell me!" Geoffrey said coldly.</p>

  <p>He was angry and frustrated at his inability to find the chaos, and he was perfectly prepared to take out his rage on these two giants. He thought they might be able to give him some answers.</p>

  <p>The two giants exchanged glances. Neither of them said a word.</p>

  <p>Without warning, the purple crystals on their backs flashed with some inner light, and tremendous power flowed into their bodies. Instantly they rushed at Geoffrey. They moved at a frightening speed, so that they looked like no more than blurs as they attacked.</p>

  <p id="top_27">The first giant grabbed Geoffrey with one hand. Even though Geoffrey's body had expanded from his time in the top floor of the Levitation Tower, increasing to four times its original size, he still resembled a child in the giant's hand.</p>

  <p>The other giant clenched his fists and brought them crashing down on Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Heavy punches rained down on Geoffrey's body.</p>

  <p>Stimulated by the purple crystals, the giant bombarded Geoffrey with a flurry of punches. His body couldn't bear the power given by the purple crystals, so his fists were smashed and bled. However, he didn't stop attacking until several minutes later.</p>

  <p>But when he finally stopped, and the two giants looked down at Geoffrey, they were stunned. His body was completely intact and unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Why is this guy so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Is he a creature from the third-grade world?"</p>

  <p>Even as the two giants muttered to each other, Geoffrey slowly raised his Heavenly Ring Staff. He said calmly, "Torture them. Give them unbearable agony."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Heavenly Ring Staff extracted a portion of his strength, and then released a strange sound, like a string being plucked.</p>

  <p>The sound was capable of penetrating into the depths of one's soul, then releasing a terrible illusion of pain.</p>

  <p>At first, the two giants tried to endure the pain. However, as it went on and on, they collapsed to ground and began to roll and howl, bellowing with anguish. They were clearly in unimaginable pain.</p>

  <p>Eventually, unable to bear it any longer, the two giants began begging for mercy. Geoffrey waved the Heavenly Ring Staff and stopped the sound.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you one more chance. Who sent you here?" Geoffrey asked, in the same icy tone as before.</p>

  <p>This time, the two giants didn't dare to hide anything, fearful of experiencing another round of torture. They bowed deeply and answered,</p>

  <p>"Our master predicted that you would come, so he asked us to set up a mousetrap here. He said we must wait for you to enter, and then trap you."</p>

  <p>"Who is your master?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"Our master... He is who he is. Who else can he be?" said a giant in a puzzled tone. The other giant nodded along, looking at Geoffrey with an expression of genuine confusion.</p>
