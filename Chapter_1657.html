<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Through his rigorous hard work and cultivation, Tianming was able to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But before ascending to the Upper World, Tianming didn't disaffiliate from the Cloud Hall. So, in a way, he could still be considered as a Cloud Hall disciple.</p>

  <p>In the Cloud Hall, Tianming was under Yudie's wings. In other words, he was her disciple.</p>

  <p>Still, Preston of the Pure Jade Sacred Place could not believe every word Yudie had said.</p>

  <p>But looking at her face, he could see no sign of deception, not even a stutter when she spoke.</p>

  <p>Yet, he still had reservations about Yudie's story. Out of these three hundred people, it was astonishing that three came from the same great world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie was in awe. Although she was not from the Upper World, she knew that these three hundred people were the most outstanding warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Since she was from the Lower World, she had not clearly understood the significance of these three hundred ace talents for many races, the glorious future they would have, and the resources and effort required to nurture an ace talent.</p>

  <p>Preston, on the other hand, knew this quite well.</p>

  <p>Even a tenth-grade sacred place like the Pure Jade Sacred Place didn't have enough resources to nurture an ace talent. Thus it was still not qualified to cultivate one.</p>

  <p>As Yudie turned to look at Preston, she noticed the skepticism on his face. She cleared her throat to get his attention and then bluntly said,</p>

  <p>"Zheng is also from Cloud Hall. And just so you know, he is also my disciple."</p>

  <p>This caught Preston off guard. He felt as if Yudie saw through him and sensed his doubt.</p>

  <p>He froze and got lost in his thought. When he finally came back to his senses, he asked, "If you don't mind, can you tell me how Cloud Hall is ranked?"</p>

  <p>If Preston remembered it right, Lower World didn't have any sacred place above the eighth grade.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is considered as a sixth-grade sacred place," Yudie humbly replied.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall was acknowledged as a sixth-grade sacred place given its current status in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>"I see…" Preston said.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, a sixth-grade sacred place was considered as an ant– small and unspectacular. The Pure Jade Sacred Place had countless small sacred places in its jurisdiction that were at least in the eighth grade.</p>

  <p>So with that said, a sixth-grade sacred place like the Cloud Hall was not even qualified to be a subordinate of the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>And if someone like Preston would personally visit a sixth-grade sacred place, its Saint Lord would probably kneel before him and welcome him with open arms.</p>

  <p>But how could two warriors from a sixth-grade sacred place like Cloud Hall be in the top three hundred of the Illusion Battlefield?</p>

  <p>That thought had left Preston puzzled. He still couldn't figure out how such a bizarre thing could happen.</p>

  <p>Yudie just ignored Preston and continued to stare at the illusions outlined on the Illusion Space. At that moment, she suddenly remembered the time when Margaret had entered the Purple Power World with her mysterious expression. Back then, Yudie didn't think much of Margaret, but it turned out that she was ready to surprise the universe with her performance in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, all the forces in the universe were paying close attention to the painting above the Illusion Space and were discussing it among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Our Xuanyuan Clan has Nathan on the stage. He will win the first place!"</p>

  <p>"Our Lucille has made it to this stage. I just hope that after this battle, she will be able to step into the Godly Way and become a Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>"The ogres will have berserker warriors."</p>

  <p>These went on with the rest of the forces that had at least one of their own make it to the third stage.</p>

  <p>There were also some martial artists from the Mist Palace who extended their necks to see their peers on the painting.</p>

  <p>"As expected, Zheng has passed through the second stage, and is now part of the top three hundred warriors," Kyron said as he shook his head and laughed. He was the former leader of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>"Master..." Standing next to Kyron was his disciple, Layla.</p>

  <p>Layla had been qualified to move forward into the second stage, but unfortunately, didn't make it past to the next.</p>

  <p>She also missed the opportunity to meet Zheng inside the Illusion Battlefield. Layla was in the same blood-colored castle as Margaret, while Zheng was in a different one. She had already been eliminated when Zheng made it to the blood-colored castle she used to be in.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm extremely proud of what you accomplished in the Illusion Battlefield. You making it to the second stage was already a great accomplishment," Kyron said with a smile. Deep down, he knew that his disciple did her best.</p>

  <p>As a master, Kyron knew how difficult it was to complete the Illusion Battlefield. Even a few ace talents with great power were also eliminated from the second stage. So, he knew that Layla had given it her all, but the second stage was just much tougher than the previous one.</p>

  <p>"Who is that woman beside Zheng?" someone suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande, who was standing in the middle, stared at a woman who she couldn't recognize at all – Margaret.</p>

  <p>Even her clones in the Eastern Region and the Sea God Continent in that great world had never seen Margaret before.</p>

  <p>"If my memory serves me right, she used the sword formation of the Purple Power World," Layla replied. The sword formation of the Purple Power World that Margaret used was quite special, and it left a mark on Layla. From then on, Layla could not forget Margaret's face.</p>

  <p>"That girl? Is she an ace talent from the Purple Power World? Look how attached they are with each other just after a short period!" someone ridiculed and laughed.</p>

  <p>"From how I see it, they must have been together for quite long."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Illusion Battlefield, Zheng remained where he was as he waited with the other warriors.</p>

  <p>After entering the purple light, the warriors found themselves in this misty fairyland.</p>

  <p>There was a new and strange feeling in their hearts after they were baptized by the countless rules of the heavens in the purple light.</p>

  <p>The imprints that the fish left within their bodies allowed them to establish the first laws of their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>So while waiting, they focused on comprehending these new laws.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, the mysterious girl's voice sounded once again to make another announcement.</p>

  <p>"Attention warriors! In this round of the Illusion Battlefield, the top ten warriors will receive a Godly Plate. Once you get the plate, I will personally imprint it in your body."</p>

  <p>Then, a short whirring sound followed.</p>

  <p>Ten gray plates slowly faded in and floated in the sky.</p>

  <p>The three hundred warriors looked up and their eyes glimmered when they saw the ten gray plates unveiling in the sky.</p>

  <p>But not all warriors knew what these plates were, especially those who didn't know much about the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Some of these warriors were Zheng, Margaret, and Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, do you know what she's talking about? Have you heard of the Godly Plate?" Margaret asked while still looking at the floating gray plates.</p>

  <p>Zheng just shook his head. He didn't even know if Margaret saw his gesture. It was also his first time to see the ten gray plates in the sky and this scene left him baffled.</p>

  <p>In the Corridor of Emperor, Zheng learned that those vying to be a True God would have to obtain a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>But as for the Godly Plate, he didn't know what it was for and had never heard of it until this moment.</p>

  <p>"Seriously? You don't know what those are?" a warrior next to them sarcastically asked with a disdainful look on his face. "The inner world won't be able to contain the Godly Tile on its own. The Godly Plate, as its name suggests, is a place where the Godly Tile is stored. So, you first must have a Godly Plate in your inner world where you can put the Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>"I see. But my next question is, where does the Godly Tile come from?"</p>

  <p>Margaret continued to ask.</p>

  <p>"I can't have all the answers, can I?" the warrior said. There were only a few True Gods in the universe. Meanwhile, the warriors currently in the Illusion Battlefield were either ace talents or Godly Geniuses. They could become True Gods, but since they were at the Soul Sea Realm, they were still hundreds of thousands of miles away from becoming True Gods. The warrior who told Margaret about the Godly Plate had only heard of the secrets about it, so he couldn't answer Margaret.</p>

  <p>"You are the ace talents and Godly Geniuses in this grand era, so this round of the heavens is in your favor and will give you the greatest chances. If you don't make it to the top ten, you will still be strengthened.</p>

  <p>The basis of that will be on how you strengthened your statues in the second stage," the mysterious girl's voice continued. After the warriors heard this, their faces were filled with surprise and joy.</p>

  <p>Back in the second stage, they put all their Illusion Points into their statues.</p>

  <p>Their Illusion Points strengthened their statues in terms of power, soul, or some law. The warriors that had put more Illusion Points were able to strengthen their statues to the maximum.</p>

  <p>They had initially spent tens or even hundreds of millions of Illusion Points that greatly strengthened them.</p>

  <p>Now, their own bodies would be strengthened based on the Illusion Points that they had initially invested.</p>

  <p>No one had expected to receive such a reward.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard this, he was equally delighted and surprised as the rest of the warriors.</p>

  <p>He knew that his statue was far stronger than that of others. It could be said that his statue was as strong as himself. So, could that mean that the enhancements would also be applied to himself?</p>

  <p>"Surely, those who make it to the top three will also receive other rewards. But I must warn you that the more rewards you receive, the heavier your burden will be."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as the mysterious girl's voice was done speaking, a huge square board measuring a million feet long and wide appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Before the warriors could react, something happened.</p>

  <p>A pink shadow appeared in the middle of the board!</p>

  <p>The warriors couldn't make out the face of the shadow, but when it spoke, they knew it was the host of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Zheng also stared at the figure, trying to figure out the identity of the mysterious young girl. The figure appeared to be using an unknown technique. Whenever Zheng quickly glanced at the figure, he could tell that it was a graceful lady. However, when he looked carefully, the figure would become blurry and could hardly be distinguished.</p>
