  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was Morgan's goal to challenge and face all the clans present by himself.</p>

  <p>He had realized too late that he had treated Osrid a bit leniently.</p>

  <p>To intimidate his opponents, he planned to utilize fierce skills and render them too afraid to face him in combat.</p>

  <p>The best way to do this was by unleashing his best moves.</p>

  <p>"Snow Track Strike!"</p>

  <p>He rushed towards Luo Zheng; he had already activated his Other Shore Token before he launched his attack.</p>

  <p>Six rays of icy light, together with Morgan's long sword, simultaneously shot towards Luo Zheng at a tremendous speed. He estimated his strike to contain at least two hundred Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Morgan felt confident that both his skill and power would allow him to overwhelmingly defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>But as he got closer and closer to Luo Zheng, he suddenly noticed something strange.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's stoic expression had not changed at all. His eyes were as serene as the surface of a bottomless lake. Morgan felt that Luo Zheng had not considered his attack as a serious threat.</p>

  <p>Where was Luo Zheng's confidence coming from?</p>

  <p>Quick as a flash, a strange thought invaded Morgan's mind.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he saw that Luo Zheng had lifted his long sword in a very slight motion. The Snow Sword collided with his sword, and deflected his sword gently to the side.</p>

  <p>He directly crashed onto Luo Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The force of his impact would have cracked a mountain had he crashed onto one. But when he came into contact with Luo Zheng, it was as if he had been slammed onto a tough stone. He was unable to even scratch Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>As if that wasn't perplexing enough, the rebound force from Luo Zheng's shoulder hit Morgan back.</p>

  <p>He was sent flying backward, and the six rays of icy light had dispersed.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>Morgan bounced on the surfaces of the giant drums, one after the other. He tried to rush to the water's surface but the water only splashed. It was futile; he ended up falling into the water himself.</p>

  <p>"Such amazing power!"</p>

  <p>All the masters and outstanding members of the Liu Clan, the Chen Clan, and the Li Clan were shockingly impressed by this exhibition of power.</p>

  <p>The onlookers had no idea why the Xu Clan wanted to prove that they were more powerful than the Su Clan. They inferred that the Su Clan might have done something that offended the Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng emerged into the arena, all of them thought that the Su Clan had no chance to win at that point.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan's defeat in the second round would probably set a new record for the quickest elimination.</p>

  <p>No one had expected that the Su Clan's invited representative would be extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Morgan was the most powerful individual in the Xu Clan's young generation.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! The Xu Clan wanted to utterly devastate the Su Clan, but now it seems that they have dug their own grave!"</p>

  <p>"The Xu Clan has no stronger fighter after Morgan lost this round."</p>

  <p>"The Xu Clan brings disgrace on themselves."</p>

  <p>Hope blossomed in the hearts of the members of the Su Clan when they saw this.</p>

  <p>They had already seen Luo Zheng's capabilities in the Blue Cloud City. Although they were shocked that Luo Zheng wasn't afraid of the divine flames, they thought that he still probably wasn't as strong as the elite disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Osrid had held Luo Zheng in high regard since a few days ago, and this made the Su Clan trust more in Luo Zheng's abilities.</p>

  <p>Still, they hadn't expected that Luo Zheng would make quick work of his fight against Morgan.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan were elated, while the Xu Clan were downtrodden.</p>

  <p>"Master, I warned you not to send Morgan to fight in the first round. You deprived yourself of a way out of this mess!"</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone else in our clan who can fight?"</p>

  <p>"Our loss is inevitable."</p>

  <p>The members of the Xu Clan were not aware of Marco's plan, nor were they aware that Marco planned to fight personally. The only thing that mattered to them now was their master's ridiculous behavior.</p>

  <p>The Xu Clan's master had an unreadable expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Everything went according to Marco's plans, but he had already gone too far. He had just wanted to use the Xu Clan for his revenge, but now all the members were turning on the master of the Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>The Xu Clan's master quashed the disappointed voice in his heart and said with his life vitality, "Young Master Marco, what should we do next given that Morgan has been bested by Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Do I still have to tell you what to do?" Marco asked back, "You have to challenge the Su Clan!"</p>

  <p>"Challenge the Su Clan? They already won against us; they have the right to challenge whoever they want. How can I challenge them?" The master of the Xu Clan was pretty inconsolable. He initially thought that it was a great advantage for them to have Marco come to the Xu City, but now it seemed that it was because of Marco that they were in big trouble. The problem was, he couldn't afford to offend Marco.</p>

  <p>"Find a way for Luo Zheng to challenge the Xu Clan," Marco ordered.</p>

  <p>"You..." The Xu Clan's master could not continue, his eyes narrowed and twitching.</p>

  <p>"I'm not telling you a second time." Marco's tone was extremely cold.</p>

  <p>The master of the Xu Clan did not dare to utter a word. Although he was the master of the Xu Clan in the Xu City, he was a dispensable figure in the real Xu Clan. It would cause him a great amount of suffering if he offended Marco.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Cailen's voice reverberated from a distance. "Our Su Clan has chosen the Lin Clan as the next opponent."</p>

  <p>A representative disciple of the Lin Clan quickly flew to the platform made of drums.</p>

  <p>He was an ordinary disciple of the Golden Mountain. How could he match Luo Zheng's power?</p>

  <p>He had not even touched Luo Zheng's sleeve before he was thrown into the water of the lake.</p>

  <p>Clans of the Clear Lake could each send two representatives to fight. The first person who had fought with Luo Zheng was not strong enough, so Cailen chose another three opponents to face Luo Zheng. As with the first one, the next three were also thrown into the lake unceremoniously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's real strength could not be gauged as he fought with such feeble opponents.</p>

  <p>The clans of the Clear Lake had a meeting among themselves when they saw the extent of Luo Zheng's abilities.</p>

  <p>"This person seems to be very powerful. I am not familiar with him but I think he must be a descendant of someone legendary."</p>

  <p>"Will he help the Su Clan claim control of the Ripple Pavilion?"</p>

  <p>"That's preposterous. The other clans still haven't shown their trump cards yet!"</p>

  <p>Just as Cailen was searching for another opponent for Luo Zheng, the Xu Clan's master stood up and challenged him. "Hey, Cailen, why not choose my clan?"</p>

  <p>All the clan masters were confused when they heard this. Even Cailen couldn't stop a frown from forming on his face.</p>

  <p>Cailen was wary of the master of the Xu Clan. Who knew what trick he might play on them? He didn't want to respond to him, so he just turned away. Just as Cailen was about to declare the next opponent, the master of the Xu Clan couldn't help but leap from his seat and rush towards him.</p>

  <p>"Cailen," he appealed impudently, "we helped your clan when you were in big trouble a hundred years ago. Could you do this for us this time?"</p>

  <p>His words sounded an alarm in Cailen's mind and made him even more puzzled.</p>

  <p>But in the end, Cailen decided to indulge the Xu Clan's master and said,</p>

  <p>"We choose the Xu Clan as our opponent!"</p>

  <p>The master of the Xu Clan breathed a heavy sigh of relief and thanked Cailen with clasped hands before returning to his own seat.</p>

  <p>From a luxurious room on the Xu Clan's flying carriage, a blue-robed Marco flew out as a sharp arrow. In the blink of an eye, he had already stood upon the huge drum. A smile of triumph played on his lips as he glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment he set eyes on Marco, Luo Zheng knew Marco was behind everything that had happened so far.</p>

  <p>Marco wanted to face Luo Zheng so badly in the battle ring that he had orchestrated such painstaking efforts. But in Luo Zheng's eyes, Marco was an idiot who would regret everything later even after all of this.</p>
