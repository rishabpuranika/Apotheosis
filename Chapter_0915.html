  <p>
</p>

  <p>"How would I know?"</p>

  <p>"Who is going to lure these damn demonic beasts away?"</p>

  <p>In the thick smoke, the three constantly used some of their life vitality to communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>Just as the three of them were panicking, two rays of bright light suddenly appeared, coming from the path they were travelling along. One was black and the other red. When the rays of light came closer, they could see that they were two mountain-like figures.</p>

  <p>The three of them were stunned for a moment. Then, one of the Night Group top-level war lords said, "I? I think we could be saved!"</p>

  <p>"It's Malcom! They are coming!" the other Night Group top-level war lords also exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Haven't the ogres already been expelled from the Tower of Sin? They really can enter the Dark Nether Cave."</p>

  <p>The ogres hadn't shared their secrets concerning the secret passageway under the Tower of Sin with the Night Group. It was impossible for them to share such an important secret with other races, even if the Night Group was their vassal.</p>

  <p>In fact, in order to achieve their secret goal, the ogre race had only issued an order to Shane, asking him to report back to Malcom through message rune as soon as he discovered Luo Zheng's whereabouts in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Receiving the order, Shane had been puzzled for a long time. He had thought that the ogres would give him an order to assassinate Luo Luo Zheng. He hadn't expected that what he would receive was an order that simply required him to report on Luo Zheng's movements to Malcom. After all, what was the use of reporting Luo Zheng's movements to Malcom? Could it be that Malcom could actually enter the Dark Nether Cave by some other means?</p>

  <p>Or was Malcom hiding in the Dark Nether Cave all this time?</p>

  <p>These questions had puzzled Shane for a long time. But since the ogres gave the order, he had to obey. Although the ogres couldn't currently enter the Tower of Sin, the Night Group's Eternal Night Sacred Place was still a vassal of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that not long after he secretly used his message rune to send the message, Malcom and Rehaan would actually rush into the Dark Nether Cave!</p>

  <p>"Malcom... Malcom's cultivation seems to be? He has become a war sage!" they exclaimed as they stared at the approaching figures.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! The ogres must have grasped the other secrets of the Tower of Sin. Colin and Neil had once suddenly appeared in the Tower of Sin as two war sages, and now Malcom has also become a war sage!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the three top-level war lords of the Night Group seemed to have found a silver lining in the clouds which had plagued their minds regarding a way to escape. Obviously, the more advanced Malcom's cultivation had become, the more it benefited them.</p>

  <p>However... although some of the Azure Wolves and the Swallowing Birds had retreated at the approaching beams of light, the three of them still found that there were many demonic beasts surrounding them. Malcom had broken through to become a war sage, but even a war sage was surely unable to deal with so many demonic beasts!</p>

  <p>Although they were still quite worried, there was now hope for them to survive with someone more powerful helping them. They would not let the chance slip by.</p>

  <p>"Malcom! Malcom!"</p>

  <p>Originally, Malcom had been a seat owner, the same as these top-level war lords of the Night Group. However, now that Malcom was a war sage, the three of them immediately became respectful and addressed him almost reverently.</p>

  <p>As their voices, carried by life vitality force, were sent to ring out in Malcom's ears, Malcom narrowed his eyes and looked forward. He saw immediately that there were three pillars of smoke which were densely surrounded by a large number of beasts. The three dematerialized smoke columns moved slowly, and numerous demonic beasts also followed closely behind them?</p>

  <p>"It's Shane," Rehaan said indifferently. "Should we go to save them?"</p>

  <p>Malcom furrowed his eyebrows as he considered the dense cluster of demonic beasts.</p>

  <p>Malcom had a great advantage in this place since he had broken through and became a war sage. Despite this, he was still very cautious. In the Dark Nether Cave, even a mighty warrior of the Soul Sea Realm would have to tread very cautiously. One wrong step would mean death. Moreover, Malcom was only a first level war sage!</p>

  <p>There were many ferocious demonic beasts gathered below, and it would be quite troublesome for Malcom to deal with them. The outcome of such a confrontation would not be certain.</p>

  <p>"Where is Luo Luo Zheng?" Malcom stopped, hovering in the air as he asked Shane through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Shane was looking pleadingly up at Malcom, hoping that he could save them. Seeing that he had suddenly stopped there, but made no move, he immediately realized that Malcom did not plan to save the three of them.</p>

  <p>Shane quickly sent a message to Malcom though his life vitality, "They have rushed into the inner circle! But I have left markers on their bodies, so that we can track them!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Shane wouldn't simply tell Malcom where Luo Luo Zheng was. If he did, he would then have nothing with which to convince Malcom to save him.</p>

  <p>"This old fox, he doesn't want to tell us!" Rehaan laughed sinisterly.</p>

  <p>Malcom shook his head and said, "It is only survival instinct. Shane thinks that we are his life-saving straw. So he will not easily let us go. If we want to know where Luo Luo Zheng is, then these three must be saved. Take out the flame-controlling scale that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place has given us."</p>

  <p>Rehaan nodded and immediately took out a small golden scale. The ogre race had dominated the Tower of Sin for a long time, so they were more familiar with the Dark Nether Cave than the other races. The flame-controlling scale was a mighty weapon and might be potent enough to deal with the assembled demonic beasts.</p>
