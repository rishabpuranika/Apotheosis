  <p>
</p>

  <p>A small slender snake was carved on the top of the jade seal. The little snake raised its head and flicked its tongue, as if it were alive.</p>

  <p>The jade seal was quite inconspicuous at a glance, a little thing, about the size of a thumb.</p>

  <p>But all the True Gods in the valley had exceptionally sharp eyes. Even a tiny mosquito would not escape them.</p>

  <p>Thus, the atmosphere of the valley suddenly became charged.</p>

  <p>Had they come across this seal in any of the other forbidden areas, the True Gods would have probably all rushed forward and fought to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>But here, nobody dared to take a move.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Rachelle, knew that anyone who moved would become a target.</p>

  <p>The strong power of time that radiated from the jade seal tortured the souls of every consummate True God with longing.</p>

  <p>Even if it was only a first grade supreme treasure of belief, to the True Gods, it would be worth fighting for.</p>

  <p>Because this was the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Usually, any supreme treasure of belief that had a connection with the Timing Divine Dao had powers and functions one could only dream about.</p>

  <p>Seeing that this jade seal was emitting such a strong power of time, they could tell that it was definitely not a first grade supreme treasure of belief. It was at least third grade, or even fourth grade.</p>

  <p>Outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land...</p>

  <p>Even those Holy Beings couldn't contain their excitement at this moment.</p>

  <p>Every supreme treasure of belief in the Time Sea Forbidden Land was by no means ordinary, and this jade seal seemed all the more unusual.</p>

  <p>They tried to act as if they were not affected at all, hiding their extreme excitement. However, they were all, in fact, secretly communicating with their consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Get that jade seal..."</p>

  <p>"At any cost!"</p>

  <p>"You must take the jade seal out of the Time Sea Forbidden Land!"</p>

  <p>"Use the right tricks..."</p>

  <p>These Holy Beings, however, were also very conflicted in their minds.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear for the consummate True Gods: whoever rushed to the circle of light would be attacked by all the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>If one of them was attacked by dozens of other consummate True Gods at once, even the exceptionally powerful ones, like Walton, Troy or Shahn, would surely die.</p>

  <p>If the consummate True Gods were slow to react, however, they would undoubtedly lose the opportunity to obtain the jade seal!</p>

  <p>The valley was engulfed in a heavy, oppressive silence.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere among the inferior True Gods, on the other hand, was relatively relaxed.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a jade seal over there!"</p>

  <p>"It's a supreme treasure of belief in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Well, do you think they will fight for it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"I honestly don't really care, as long as their fight doesn't harm us."</p>

  <p>With their cultivation level, these True Gods were not qualified to participate in the fight for the jade seal. They could only stand and watch from the side.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept the valley and landed on the jade seal. The expression in his eyes was one of utmost calm.</p>

  <p>It seemed like a fight in the valley was inevitable. He only wondered who would win and get the jade seal in the end.</p>

  <p>"The circle of light is spreading?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, too, had noticed that something was changing, after having observed the scene for a while.</p>

  <p>When the Time Elk died, a multicolored circle of light and the jade seal appeared under its feet. After a while, the circle of light that had pooled on the ground around it did not disappear. On the contrary, it was expanding...</p>

  <p>The power of time that the Time Elk had exuded before was of a discontinuous nature. Similar to the sea water in the Time Sea, it was formed through the condensation of individual time fragments, and the structure was irregular and covered in cracks.</p>

  <p>However, there were no cracks in the power of time that wrapped the jade seal. It was a complete power of time. No one knew what would happen as it continued to spread.</p>

  <p>Standing still, many of the consummate True Gods exchanged lengthy looks. Troy was the first to break the silence. "This jade seal looks extraordinary and it must be very precious. I'm sure none of you are willing to easily give it up."</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied a middle-aged man in armor. He was holding a sword, and its blade was circled by a faint stream of light.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that we take this treasure out of the Time Sea Forbidden Land and let the Hall of Holy Beings decide," said Troy.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, Walton and some other consummate True Gods all remained silent.</p>

  <p>They and the Dongfang Clan were family. Naturally, they would accept this proposal.</p>

  <p>"Troy, are you kidding? Why didn't you just say that we should offer it to the Holy Emperor of your clan?" a consummate True God from the Sword Clan said sarcastically, sneering in disgust.</p>

  <p>"He's right. What are we fighting for then? Is it possible that Nicholas of your clan could slice the jade seal into pieces and distribute them to us?"</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was a consummate True God from the War God Hall.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan occupied a large number of seats in the Hall of Holy Beings, but it was not so influential that no big clan could contend with it.</p>

  <p>For example, the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan were both forces that could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>But if the jade seal was sent to the Hall of Holy Beings, it would cause even bigger dispute!</p>

  <p>Troy's face darkened. "Well, seeing as you don't agree with me, you must have a better idea," he asked in a mocking tone. "Who, then, should get the jade seal?"</p>

  <p>"It should belong to whoever manages to take it, obviously!" Hearing this, a consummate True God from the Moon Clan sneered. Like a candle going out, he disappeared on the spot.</p>

  <p>The first consummate True God that acted might face the biggest risk, but the possibility of him getting the jade seal was also the highest!</p>

  <p>"Dream on!"</p>

  <p>"The jade seal belongs to our Tang Clan!"</p>

  <p>Nobody responded to this proclamation.</p>

  <p>Instead, all the consummate True Gods moved, simultaneously, towards the place where the jade seal was.</p>

  <p>Even the most calm of the consummate True Gods, like Troy, moved instantly and swiftly.</p>

  <p>However, at the same time, a strange scene manifested itself before their eyes...</p>

  <p>None of the consummate True Gods that had moved towards the colorful circle of light ever managed to touch the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Their figures seemed to flash, like holograms, above the jade seal for a moment. Then they stopped, their figures appearing frozen in time, their arms outstretched to grab the seal, but motionless. They all had a strange look on their faces. They lingered for a while, but in the next moment, their figures began to gradually fade.</p>

  <p>The True Gods in the valley were all shocked.</p>

  <p>When they saw the consummate True Gods scrambling for the jade seal, they all expected a fierce fight to begin.</p>

  <p>They had never expected that such a thing would happen.</p>

  <p>"Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"All of them have disappeared..."</p>

  <p>Reginald, Soren and the other True Gods widened their eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>"The jade seal is still there!" a True God shouted.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, some of the True Gods quickly dashed towards the east of the valley.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he also rushed over.</p>

  <p>In the end, all the True Gods stopped at the place where the multicolored circle of light was pooling.</p>

  <p>"The problem must lie in the power of time," Luo Zheng said softly.</p>

  <p>Pascal, who stood beside him, nodded and replied, "Yes. The power of time on this stage has already begun to fluctuate. The consummate True Gods must have been sucked in."</p>

  <p>Moments ago, this sheath of colorful light, had lain still and flat on the ground. Now, however, it had turned into a colorful vortex, faint ripples faintly disturbing its otherwise smooth surface.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked up a stone from the ground. Aiming at the jade seal, he hurled the stone towards it.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The stone made a swishing sound, and as soon as it entered the colorful circle of light, it disappeared.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>What he had guessed turned out to be correct.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods could use the spatial transference to move, so when they moved to the place above the jade seal, they were sucked in by the colorful circle of light.</p>

  <p>In fact, anything that touched the edge of the colorful circle of light would inevitably be sucked in!</p>

  <p>"Have those consummate True Gods already died?" a True God asked.</p>

  <p>As Kelsey heard this, her face immediately darkened. "Stop talking nonsense!" she said angrily. Alfredo was, after all, sucked into it.</p>

  <p>Soren looked towards Kelsey. "No, they haven't died," he said. "These streams of power of time are continuous. I think people can pass through it safely, but I don't know where it will lead to..."</p>

  <p>Theoretically, the Time Sea of the divine land could lead to any point of time in the past.</p>

  <p>But the Time Sea was made out of time fragments, and there were countless time cracks. Therefore, any creature that fell into the Time Sea would be cut into pieces by those cracks, and then these pieces would fall into different times in history!</p>

  <p>However, the power of time in front of them was a complete time passage, unlike that of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"Should we go in?" another True God asked.</p>

  <p>"Haha, it is possible that those consummate True Gods will never be able to come back! We cannot know for sure what has happened to them. If you go with them, you will be flirting with death!" a True God taunted.</p>

  <p>A helpless expression appeared on the faces of many True Gods. The jade seal was so close to them, but they couldn't even touch it. This made everyone feel depressed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the colorful circle of light for a short while. After making up his mind, he turned around to look at Liusu and said, "I'll go in, too."</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, Liusu's fine eyelashes trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey also looked at Luo Zheng. It seemed to be a reckless decision. As the other True Gods had already said, it was too risky.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. He said something to Liusu, his lips barely moving.</p>

  <p>Then, a confident smile turned up the edges of his mouth. Without further ado, he proceeded to jump into the colorful circle of light, followed by the screams of the True Gods he left behind.</p>
