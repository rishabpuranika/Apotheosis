<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1474 Ascending (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rules set by the heavens were perfectly ironclad. No one could ever fly in the face of them.</p>

  <p>After reaching the status of a Supreme Lord and bearing the Heavenly Destiny, one could make use of the Law of Causality to construct their own Transcendent Divine Might. And apart from that, their lifespan would also be significantly extended.</p>

  <p>There were simply not enough positions available for the Supreme Lords. In its entirety, the universe had a hundred thousand supreme worlds, and every single supreme world had their own world lord. Also, there were dozens of grand world lords who ruled over some supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>That being said, there were only 128 world lords that could have the chance of bearing the Heavenly Destiny and becoming a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>For that very reason, whenever a Supreme Lord would draw his last breath, there was bound to be a fierce battle between the world lords to get their mitts on the vacant position.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, this time, a completely unexpected exception cropped up.</p>

  <p>For some unknown reasons, an extra position for a Supreme Lord had suddenly appeared from out of the blue.</p>

  <p>This additional position seemed to have altered the fate of the heavens, causing it to tremble violently and bringing chaos to the rules set by the heavens.</p>

  <p>Every single one of the Supreme Lords had a somber look on their faces.</p>

  <p>They were clueless as to what was about to happen because they had never been in a position such as this one. What on earth could end up happening now that there was an extra position for a Supreme Lord?</p>

  <p>How did this come to be? What caused it to manifest in the universe?</p>

  <p>Just how were they supposed to take this extra position in hand?</p>

  <p>Given the fact that it went completely against the rules imposed by the heavens, it had quickly caught the attention of all the powerful figures in the universe.</p>

  <p>The relentless chaos in the heavens continued.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the bottom of the Endless Abyss, Xun had already walked over toward Zheng's side. As her gaze was completely fixated on the shaking crown in front of her, a dreadful look appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"This is the Crown of Destiny," Xun said under her breath, "It only appears when a Supreme Lord passes away."</p>

  <p>Back in the day, Xun had once led the Demon Night race to have a hand in the battle for the Crown of Destiny. After an Orc Supreme Lord's lifespan unfortunately reached its end, the Crown of Destiny materialized. Xun summoned a number of branches of the Demon Night race, managing to successfully win the Crown of Destiny from all of the other races.</p>

  <p>And at the end of that, the one who bore the Heavenly Destiny, becoming the Supreme Lord, was none other than Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>For that very reason, Supreme Lord Leroy had always been loyally following her since that day.</p>

  <p>As he attentively listened to Xun's explanation, Luo Zheng seemed to be deeply interested and asked, "Then, does that mean I can become a Supreme Lord once I put on this Crown of Destiny right here and now?"</p>

  <p>"No, you will not," shaking her head, Xun answered, "Those who bear the Heavenly Destiny have to go through the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm and become a world lord first and foremost. I'm afraid your cultivation base is still much too low!"</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm were the three important levels before the world lord level.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm was the process of developing the Soul Sea, while the Spirit Supreme Realm was the process of bringing life into the inner world. And lastly, the Spirit Transformation Realm was the process of transforming into a god in the inner world.</p>

  <p>It should be worth mentioning that a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior wasn't an actual 'god'. The title of 'god' was only with respect to the living creatures within the inner world. After a warrior reached the Spirit Transformation Realm, the more lives were brought forth within the inner world and the more powerful the strength of such lives was, the more terrifying this Spirit Transformation Realm warrior's strength would turn out to be.</p>

  <p>Only after reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm could one be given the title of a world lord and receive the qualification to bear the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head in response, Luo Zheng realized that this Crown of Destiny seemed to be something quite astonishing. Unfortunately for him, it wasn't something that could really be of help to him given the situation they were in. "So, that means this Crown of Destiny is just a useless piece of trash to me right now," he cried out, sounding so disappointed.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?! You dare call it a USELESS PIECE OF TRASH?!"</p>

  <p>Livingston had been left utterly dumbfounded by his statement. The heavens might have changed, but the rules for bearing the Heavenly Destiny still remained the same. The Crown of Destiny was regarded as a very important treasure for every warrior from any of the races, and yet here was Luo Zheng referring to it as useless trash!</p>

  <p>A tinge of a smile crept onto Xun's face as she said, "Indeed, it might be of no value to you at the moment, but after you become a world lord, I assure you that it's going to be very beneficial to you by then.</p>

  <p>What I'm dying to know right now is what's going to happen if one more Supreme Lord appears apart from the 128 current Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>Livingston was in the dark as to what was going on with Luo Zheng and Xun right now.</p>

  <p>It should be recognized that the Crown of Destiny was something that everyone would be willing to put their life on the line for. However, it couldn't dramatically give Luo Zheng an instant boost. Earlier, Yao had already made her move, making it even more difficult for them to get out of the underground palace. And there was just no way Luo Zheng would be able to continue cultivating here until he could reach the level of the world lords and then bear the Heavenly Destiny and eventually become a Supreme Lord. That was obviously totally out of the question at this point.</p>

  <p>In comparison, figuring out a way to get out of the underground palace was of the utmost importance to them.</p>
