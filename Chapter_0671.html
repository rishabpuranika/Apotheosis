<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 671 Any Other Volunteers (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>When Mason finally hit the ground unconscious, Zheng glanced at the rest of the practitioners in front of him. He could see the fear in their eyes and knew that no one would dare to attack him. But he continued to taunt them,"Any other volunteers? I'm just warming up!"</p>

  <p>Bevis of the Mysterious Luna Hall was speechless. He froze and felt cold sweats coming out from his body.</p>

  <p>He had just missed the fate that Mason had suffered. If it weren't for Fred who blocked his attack aimed at Zheng, he might be the one knocked down by Zheng. He wouldn't be able to dodge that attack. 'What on earth was that? What kind of fist attack technique did he use on Mason and how was it so powerful?'</p>

  <p>Bevis was left confused.</p>

  <p>Bevis was smart, but it was only natural that he couldn't completely comprehend the fight attack technique that Zheng had used on Mason.</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm masters like Saint Morphens even needed to destabilize the space before using the Mystical Pace, but he was still unable to comprehend the complete first level of Space Law. Neither the broken stone carving on the Cloud Road nor the one in the Cloud Hall was the complete Space Law! Hence, no practitioner was able to comprehend the complete first level of Space Law.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, had completely comprehended the first level of Space Law when he was in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, the best cultivation resources were within Zheng's reach. The cultivation resources in the Upper World were much better than those in the Central Region. It was also the reason why many high-ranking practitioners from the Central Region wanted to go to Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>Afraid of what might happen to them, no practitioner dared to challenge Zheng. They all took a step back in the hopes of avoiding the same fate as Mason. Catching Zheng would be extremely beneficial for them however, they would be putting their lives on the line by doing so. They knew that even if they could catch Zheng, they wouldn't be able to enjoy the fruit of their labor if they were dead.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, it's a pleasant surprise to see you here! Of all places, I didn't expect we'd meet again in Dragon Soar Arena. I should tell you that our Cloud Hall leader has gone crazy looking for you!" Fred said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Despite the trouble he had caused the head of Cloud Hall, Fred was sure that the latter would be so damn proud to know that one of her disciples had entered the Dragon Soar Arena. It would be the best thing that could happen to Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"I know," Zheng nodded. He immediately recognized Fred. They had met back when he was still in the Elite House. "Can you tell me where am I?</p>

  <p>How come the Dragon Soar Arena has been moved here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since Zheng came into the Dragon Soar Arena. He noticed the many gorgeous buildings in the nearby area and thought that he might be in a big city right now.</p>

  <p>Fred could understand the confusion that Zheng was in now, but there was not the time for him to answer his question. He said,"It's a long story. For now, let's leave here right now. Our leader is in the Oracle City, too."</p>

  <p>"Right! Let's go!" Zheng said in agreement. When they were about to leave, Zheng noticed that though the practitioners had stopped attacking him, they still didn't want to let him go. They were still blocking Zheng's exit. It was starting to get annoying for Zheng, but before he could lose his temper, he calmed himself down. "Don't do anything foolish or I won't hesitate to kill you all!" he threatened.</p>

  <p>The practitioners from Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect, Ethereal Spirit Sect, and other grade four sects were already scared of Zheng after he easily defeated Mason. However, it didn't mean that they would just give up. Since they could not afford to catch him, they could at least not let him go at any cost.</p>

  <p>They could buy time until reinforcement could come.</p>

  <p>With the upcoming Martial Arts Contest, the masters and disciples of different sects had gathered in Oracle City. While Zheng was busy with Mason, someone had secretly burned the message rune and sent the message out. Once the reinforcements had arrived, it would be difficult for Zheng to escape. These practitioners believed that Zheng would be no match for either the Internal Elixir Realm masters or the Virtual Tribulation Realm masters.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, listen up! Zheng is a disciple in Cloud Hall. If you treasure your lives, you'd make way for him. Or suffer the consequence…" Fred said coldly.</p>

  <p>Fred chose to stay neutral at the beginning because he didn't know that Zheng was in the Dragon Soar Arena. But now that he and Zheng had finally met, he wouldn't just standby anymore. Anyone who dared to challenge Zheng was challenging the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Though fear in the practitioners had intensified, no one backed down.</p>

  <p>"I guess you all chose to die! I'll make it quick!" Zheng shouted. He didn't want to waste any more time in this place. He had a rough time to come back to the Central Region. Now that he was about to step out of the Dragon Soar Arena, he wouldn't let anyone stand in his way. But these practitioners were getting into his nerves and they left him no choice but to fight. When he raised his leg, space began to vibrate. Then like a ghost, Zheng floated away.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng was completely out of the Dragon Soar Arena. He was about to attack the practitioners who were blocking his way when he suddenly heard a voice. The voice said,"Don't be such a big mouth! Maybe the one to be killed is nobody, but you!"</p>

  <p>The voice was sweet and gentle that it made Zheng stop momentarily.</p>
