<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The audience in the universe reflected on the story that Zheng told them.</p>

  <p>Of course, not all living creatures liked to listen to such things.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists needed to cultivate in seclusion and not be disturbed at all. Once they had cultivated to a critical point, a single disturbance could cause their cultivation to go berserk.</p>

  <p>The sound of the Roaring Token was unstoppable in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Whether it was deep underground or far into the sky, it could be heard without any obstructions. There was no way to resist it.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had only a few Roaring Tokens. Normally, only one of them would be used in a day. Sometimes, they did not use it even once in fifteen days. Even so, once it rang out, it was not a small risk to the martial artists undergoing a tribulation or breaking through their bottlenecks, for it could possibly jeopardize their tasks.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng had used the Roaring Token to tell a story, and he narrated it for several hours.</p>

  <p>It was torture enough for these martial artists.</p>

  <p>Some practitioners had even given up on their training. They became resentful of Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the lifetime worth of these martial artists might not be enough to purchase a Roaring Token. Even if they were angry, Zheng would not be able to hear them.</p>

  <p>Not long after he finished telling his story, Zheng heard a series of clanging sounds behind him. He turned to see Livingston rushing toward him speedily. In the blink of an eye, Livingston used his hands to grab onto Zheng's arms and said in an excited tone, "Z-Zheng..."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" A strange expression appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"I...I..." Livingston continued to gesticulate frantically, unable to speak clearly. After a long while, he finally said, "Can you open that weapon refining workshop? Immortal Book said that you could do it!"</p>

  <p>To open the workshop, Zheng had to embark on the True Path once again.</p>

  <p>He could obtain a token immediately after passing a stage of the True Path.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current cultivation and strength had improved by quite a bit. He was confident that he would be able to take another step forward in the True Path. Perhaps, he might even be able to take two steps forward.</p>

  <p>However, the tokens he obtained from roaming about the True Path would be randomly distributed. In addition to the token required to open the weapon refining workshop, there were also tokens for the pill refining workshop, as well as the training tower. Zheng could not guarantee for certain that he would get his hands on the one required for the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he smiled faintly and said, "This time, as I've returned to the fairy palace, I will certainly try to overcome the True Path once again.</p>

  <p>However, I can't guarantee you that I'll be able to open the weapon refining workshop."</p>

  <p>Clang! After hearing Zheng's answer, Livingston fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Although one could not see any expressions on his face, one could tell from his action that he had fallen into depression.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Have you learnt a lot in the library?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's question, Livingston got up abruptly and said enthusiastically, "Yes, quite a lot! Oh my Lord…"</p>

  <p>His excitement was beyond words. As a weapon refiner of the last grand era, he was naturally a very conceited person, even to the point of madness.</p>

  <p>When he had first flipped through the books on weapon refining, he had been full of disapproval. The fairy palace was a magical place, but in Livingston's eyes, its owner was wasting a lot of resources in decorating the walls and the floors. The wastefulness of it all was outrageous.</p>

  <p>However, once he started reading through the books in detail, he was immediately immersed and unable to extricate himself from it.</p>

  <p>Livingston was a very intelligent person as well. With respect to weapon refining, he had put forward many bold ideas. But just because he had put them forward did not mean that he could realize them.</p>

  <p>As he skimmed through the pages, he realized that many of his ideas already existed. Not only had the ancestors completed his ideas, but they had also improved on them.</p>

  <p>After all, these ancient books and legacies came from beyond the universe; from above the heavens.</p>

  <p>Once Livingston had finished reading, he felt almost dizzy. The shock in his heart had almost caused him to be unable to stand steadily.</p>

  <p>It was also because of this that his interest in the weapon refining workshop had grown even more. However, he was unable to enter the workshop and could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>Just at that moment, Immortal Book had reminded Livingston that Zheng could open the weapon refining workshop. Upon hearing this, he naturally became ecstatic and ran over, begging Zheng to open the workshop by any means, no matter what.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not reject his plea. Back then, he had in fact brought Livingston into the fairy palace in order to put him in charge of the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already passed two stages of the True Path and had broken through to the Soul Sea Realm. It was time to enter again. It was just that he could not guarantee what kind of token he would get.</p>

  <p>After making some preparations, Saul led the way for them. Zheng, Freya, and Livingston followed closely behind. Naturally, Xun floated by Zheng's side as they passed through the great halls of the fairy palace and headed straight for the True Path.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had embarked on the True Path in the Lower World. At that time, he had relied on "power transfer" to transmit the power of his opponent to any corner of the great world.</p>

  <p>It was also because of this ability that he had been able to pass the first two stages of the True Path in one go.</p>

  <p>As of now, Zheng had already ascended to the Upper World. His connection with the great world was already weak. Now, he could only rely on himself.</p>

  <p>However, his strength was no longer what it used to be. After his cultivation improved, his strength had also greatly increased. Facing the vast fog, he did not hesitate to step into the True Path.</p>

  <p>Zheng already had four tokens in his possession. They were the wind token for entering the fairy palace, the thunder token to open the True Path, the mountain token to bring the fairy palace along, and the water token to access the library.</p>

  <p>Since these were tokens corresponding to the Eight Diagrams, there should still be four more tokens in True Path, namely the fire token for opening the weapon refining workshop, the valley token for opening the pill refining workshop, the earth token for opening the training tower, as well as the heaven token.</p>

  <p>Which token he obtained was a matter of pure luck. Saul had once said that there was a probability of obtaining a token he already possessed, something that would be unfortunate.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff...</p>

  <p>As Zheng slowly moved forward, the surrounding scenery gradually changed. The Dark and Light energies once again appeared and entangled with each other, forming numerous human figures.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was a race with golden bloodlines, just like the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still unclear as to the relationship between the two, but the Sacred race was indeed a perfect race.</p>

  <p>These figures materialized one by one into Sacred martial artists and charged straight toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng held the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand, his eyes flashing with a dazzling light. The chaotic sea in his body surged along waves, while the power in his body began to rush forward like the tides.</p>

  <p>During the times he had been chased, he had relied on the Reincarnation Plate, Xun, and the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng himself, he had not contributed too much. His cultivation was still too low, so he needed to train more.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>As he slowly brandished his sword, dozens of Nether God Shadows escaped from it. They went in different directions to encounter the Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>Pfft, pfft, pfft...</p>

  <p>As the Nether God Shadows closed in on the Sacred martial artists, they easily tore their opponents to shreds, quickly turning them into Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Zheng was aware that it would not be difficult for him at the beginning of the third stage of the True Path.</p>

  <p>Just the Nether God Shadows themselves were enough to tear apart the Sacred martial artists. He maintained his speed and continued forward.</p>

  <p>However, after about five minutes, the strength of the Sacred martial practitioners formed by the Dark and Light energies seemed to increase.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the martial artists who appeared before him were at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Elites from Sacred race?" Zheng's gaze darkened as he stared at them.</p>

  <p>These warriors from Sacred race were clad in golden armors, with exquisite patterns carved onto them. They held all kinds of divine weapons in their hands. It was obvious that they were unlike the Sacred warriors whom he had encountered before.</p>

  <p>The punches of the Nether God Shadows were far less effective than those of the elites. The elites easily cleaved the Nether God Shadows into pieces and then circled round Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing the first Sacred elite, who rushed at him, Zheng wielded the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound rang out. Zheng's face revealed some surprise. His sword attack had been blocked by a Sacred elite, who was using a halberd!</p>

  <p>Zheng snorted dismissively and turned his sword in a soft motion. His weapon flashed like lightning as it went around the elite's neck. When a spurt of golden blood squirted out, Zheng's figure was already a thousand feet away.</p>
