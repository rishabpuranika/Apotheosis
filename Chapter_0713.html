<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 713 The Unveiling Competition </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The world of cultivators was cruel.</p>

  <p>The cultivators at the nature level were respected throughout the Eastern Region, while the ones in the Illuminating Soul Realm were even more influential.</p>

  <p>Sadly for the hundreds of prisoners, however, they were one-time strong cultivators, but ended up being a means of increasing human life years for the other cultivators at the contest held in Oracle City, no matter how respected they used to be.</p>

  <p>After beating the drum, Dillon threw the drumstick aside and sat back in his chair, cramming his obese body in.</p>

  <p>Silence reigned in the arena. Most of the cultivators were still immersed in the transcendent experience the golden light had brought them.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Dillon summoned his life vitality to his voice and said to everyone present, "Before the opening of the Martial Arts Contest, I'd like to make an announcement, which I hope will spread around."</p>

  <p>His listeners were bewildered by his sudden, confusing words.</p>

  <p>Dillon continued, "Someone in our World Commercial Alliance concluded that the ninth enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb had turned up."</p>

  <p>As if a stone had been thrown into a serene lake, heated discussions ensued after a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"Enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb? The enchanted lamps from the celestial tomb lit on the Lantern Lighting Festival? The last one has turned up too?"</p>

  <p>"My goodness! This last enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb hasn't been lit in a thousand years. What a surprise it is that it has turned up now!"</p>

  <p>"How do they know?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard that humans who have lived for over a thousand years are monsters? There's an Ancient Tycoon in the World Commercial Alliance. I bet it was him who drew the conclusion."</p>

  <p>The Lantern Lighting Festival was held every year in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>During this time, commoners lit lanterns and put up festoons. The praying lanterns were then set into the night sky. Since parents bought smaller lanterns for their children, every boy and girl carried their lamps along the streets and had fun.</p>

  <p>For ordinary folks, it was just a festival.</p>

  <p>Yet, for cultivators, the Lantern Lighting Festival meant more than that. On this day, they didn't look forward to lighting ordinary lanterns. Instead, they wanted to light the enchanted lamps from the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>They had celebrated numerous Lantern Lighting Festivals. Finally, this year, the last enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb had turned up.</p>

  <p>"If the person who has gotten the last lamp is ready, he can light it at this year's Lantern Lighting Festival so that we can get into the celestial tomb and get what we want," said Dillon. Obviously, his statement was addressed to the person who had gotten the last enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb. Since he didn't know who this person was, he hoped the cultivators would spread his message. He believed that sooner or later, his instructions would reach the right person's ears.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, no one knew whether this person would light the lamp or not.</p>

  <p>After all, he or she might be too weak to enter Mist's Celestial Tomb.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yudie's and Zheng's eyes met.</p>

  <p>The enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb had been retrieved from the Blood Fiend Emperor's last black chest. Although Ning Yudie had brought the Blood Fiend Emperor's treasures to Cloud Hall, only she and Luo Zheng knew about the last enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Confusion shone in Zheng's eyes as he looked at Ning Yudie. Since the Celestial Tomb was an immortal's tomb, its contents had to be significant. Moreover, the tomb was probably related to the mysterious fairy palace in the Eastern Region. Luo Zheng was resolved to enter the tomb and explore it.</p>

  <p>However, right now, he had to deal with the Martial Arts Contest first.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie blinked and looked away awkwardly. Somehow, she felt guilty and found it hard to face Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Well said. I have an enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb too. I'm looking forward to seeing all the lamps be lit at this year's Lantern Lighting Festival. If we can have Mist, the immortal's inheritances, our cultivation base will definitely increase. Haha!" Eddie laughed loudly.</p>

  <p>So far, the whereabouts of the nine enchanted lamps were still unknown. No one knew who had which one.</p>

  <p>Normally, the cultivators who had them would do everything to keep this knowledge a secret.</p>

  <p>However, Eddie had just revealed his secret openly.</p>

  <p>By telling everyone that he had an enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb, he was declaring that he had to be one of those who would enter Mist's Celestial Tomb in the future.</p>

  <p>This was a voice of confidence and strength. He believed that no one would dare try anything risky on him as he was the strongest cultivator of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>After Dillon had made his announcement, the three chairs began descending from the sky. Soon they landed on one of the platforms.</p>

  <p>It was not until then that Xiao, who grew a handlebar mustache and was the referee of the Martial Arts Contest, slowly stepped onto the field.</p>

  <p>"The Martial Arts Contest of Oracle City begins," he declared. Then four men flew toward the platforms, carrying an exquisite green jade case with dragon designs and phoenix designs carved into it.</p>

  <p>This case was used to draw lots.</p>

  <p>Disciples of fourth-tier sects such as Ethereal Spirit Sect, Bloodwood Cliff, Cloud Hall, and Mysterious Luna Hall all threw their name tags into the jade case as the four men passed them.</p>

  <p>When the jade case came to Eddie, Luo Zheng became very tense, watching him closely.</p>

  <p>He wasn't relieved until the woman at the middle-stage of the Internal Elixir Realm who had accompanied Eddie tossed her name tag into the jade case.</p>

  <p>Now, he was sure that she was Marilyn. He had been worried that she wouldn't take part in the Martial Arts Contest. In that case, he wouldn't have a chance to kill her.</p>

  <p>The youth who resembled Eddie also added his name tag to the growing pile.</p>

  <p>When the disciples of the fourth-tier sects had put their name tags in the jade case, it was time to collect the name tags of the cultivators who had passed the pre-qualifying test.</p>

  <p>Since they had been handed to an elder of the World Commercial Alliance, the elder put them in the case all at once.</p>

  <p>There were more than thirty cultivators, among whom Luo Zheng was the most special, because he had participated in this contest as an independent cultivator, and at the same time, he was also a disciple of the Elite House of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>When all the name tags had been collected, the jade case stopped in mid-air above the field.</p>

  <p>The first match, the unveiling competition of the event, would undoubtedly draw the most attention. As they were all dying to know who the first two competitors would be, everyone craned their necks and fixed their eyes on the jade case.</p>

  <p>Xiao flew to the jade case and patted it lightly.</p>

  <p>"Clickety-clack."</p>

  <p>The jade case started shaking. Soon, two name tags were spat out of it.</p>

  <p>Xiao picked them up and glanced at them. Then he announced, "For the unveiling competition, Dawson Zhao, an independent cultivator versus Segar Yu, a disciple of the Mysterious Luna Hall."</p>

  <p>"Dawson Zhao? The Divine Traveler, the one who got through Chaotic Ocean of Stars alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's him. Even cultivators at the Virtual Tribulation Realm have scruples about challenging the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. Yet, not only did Dawson Zhao get through it safely, but it is also said that he gained a lot from that experience. His life has changed since then."</p>

  <p>"Who is this Segar Yu of Mysterious Luna Hall? I've never heard of him. I guess Dawson Zhao will beat him to a pulp."</p>

  <p>Mysterious Luna Hall was very secretive. It belonged to neither the Righteous faction nor the Evil faction of the martial sects. As a sect, it was well-known, yet most of its disciples were obscure. Among the hundreds of thousands of practitioners in the spectators' stand, no one had heard of Segar Yu.</p>

  <p>The Elderly Luna heard the conversation but remained silent. He was sitting in an old-fashioned wooden armchair. His eyes glistened. "Segar, go. Since you're lucky enough to fight in the unveiling competition, it will be a shame to leave the field without seeing blood. Go kill him!" he said.</p>

  <p>Not far from him, an ordinary-looking youth nodded at his words. He jumped off one of the platforms and walked onto the field.</p>

  <p>Unlike the competitions between sects, the Martial Arts Contests meant life or death. There were no rules about methods. No one cared who the challengers were. There was no pity or mercy, as mercy for a foe would mean death to themselves.</p>

  <p>A green light curtain rose slowly and covered the entire field.</p>

  <p>Before the competition started, the two contestants would be separated by the light curtain.</p>

  <p>Not long after Segar Yu had walked onto the field, Dawson Zhao entered as well.</p>

  <p>With no ceremonies and no courtesies, the two challengers were like beasts trapped in cages, waiting for the light curtain to be removed. It was a touch-and-go situation.</p>

  <p>With a mild swish, the light curtain disappeared. Dawson Zhao stomped his feet, and life vitality spread like ripples under his feet. He dashed toward Segar at lightning speed.</p>
