<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In terms of geography, the Chaotic Ocean of Stars was an impassable natural moat but the divine kingdoms had a much longer history than the Central Region, and there were innumerable cultivators among them who were capable of crossing the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear from Luo Zheng's journey to the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb that even Life and Death Realm experts, who were top-level cultivators in the Central Region, were merely qualified to be followers of the Holy Maiden and the prince in the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>If the divine kingdoms had truly intervened, then who in the Central Region could take on the Heavenly Evil Sect?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a somber expression. "Did you draw this conclusion by yourself?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Owen shook his head. "Almost everyone in the commercial alliance agrees with this. And so does the leader of Cloud Hall," he informed.</p>

  <p>"Our leader? Is she in the Oracle City?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, hope flickering in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Mu Ning immediately turned to him with interest, and a faint smile appeared on her face. Luo Luo Zheng, who was talking with Owen, didn't notice her expression.</p>

  <p>Owen, on the other hand, was curious. "How come you don't know about the movements of the Cloud Hall, Luo Luo Zheng?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Owen thought that Luo Luo Zheng was a core member of the Cloud Hall. However, he had no idea about the pact between Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance to fight the Heavenly Evil Sect together. It was very strange.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled in embarrassment. How could he explain the matter between him and Ning Yudie to Owen? Besides, he didn't think that there was actually a conflict between him and Ning Yudie. In fact, he couldn't figure out what was wrong. Ning Yudie had suddenly become indifferent towards him for some unknown reasons, and he was at a loss as to what to do about it.</p>

  <p>This time, the Cloud Hall had sent out all their elites, leaving only Luo Luo Zheng behind. How could he take it easy?</p>

  <p>However, after his previous interaction with Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng had a vague understanding of how crazy women could be. Although he was annoyed by Yudie's actions, he didn't want to argue with her. After all, sometimes there was a communication gap between two genders.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply couldn't understand her attitude towards him.</p>

  <p>"I was cultivating in seclusion all that time and was indeed unaware of this.</p>

  <p>Owen, please tell me more," Luo Luo Zheng said, forcing a smile.</p>

  <p>Owen replied gracefully, "The leader of the Cloud Hall didn't stay in the Oracle City. Recently, she has been quite active and has been killing warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect. For that reason, she rarely returns to the Oracle City."</p>

  <p>According to the original plan, the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance had joined hands to declare war on the Heavenly Evil Sect. As the only Life and Death Realm expert of the Cloud Hall, Ning Yudie was supposed to stay put in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later, there would be a decisive battle between Oracle City and the Heavenly Evil Sect. The Life and Death Realm experts of both sides normally would choose not to fight before that. Once these warriors attacked, it signaled the start of the final battle.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie had broken that unspoken rule. She had joined the war alone, slaughtering warriors in the big cities that were occupied by the Heavenly Evil Sect. Both the Heavenly Evil Sect and the World Commercial Alliance couldn't understand how to deal with her impulsive actions.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance was worried about Yudie's safety. She was unquestionably powerful, but she couldn't fight Eddie and Simon at the same time. If the Heavenly Evil Sect was to set a trap, which could kill Ning Yudie, it would be a devastating blow to both the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon of the Commercial Alliance would have to fight alone, and their chances of beating the Heavenly Evil Sect would be even slimmer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie's actions were causing a lot of trouble for the Heavenly Evil Sect too.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect used a kind of fighting method which could converge hundreds of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors' strengths, but it was not perfect. If their enemies were strong enough, they might not get the chance to converge their strengths together. This fighting method was effective against Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors, but to deal with a Life and Death Realm warrior like Ning Yudie, it was not enough.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie hadn't used her common sense and had instead rushed to the front lines. Every time she attacked, hundreds or thousands of enemy warriors would be killed. This had greatly slowed down the expansion of the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, preparations were in full swing at the Heavenly Evil Sect for the impending battle. The Heavenly Evil Sect's Life and Death Realm warriors hadn't made any moves, nor did they show any intention to attack Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Thus, the war seemed to have reached stalemate.</p>

  <p>Relatively speaking, the worries of the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall were much bigger than that of the Heavenly Evil Sect. While Ning Yudie had destroyed many of the Heavenly Evil Sect's bottom level forces, these warriors were inconsequential when it came to the outcome of the battle. It was the warriors at the highest level who would decide the result of the war.</p>

  <p>If the Heavenly Evil Sect counterattacked, Ning Yudie would be in great danger.</p>

  <p>All her efforts would be in vain.</p>

  <p>For this reason, many people had tried to persuade Ning Yudie but they had all failed.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Cloud Hall were her subordinates, so they naturally could not persuade her. The people of the World Commercial Alliance were only allies, so they could not order her to stay in the city either. She had quietly left the city by herself, and gone about exterminating every Heavenly Evil Sect warrior she could find. She would return to the city for a quick refueling of supplies. In the past month, Ning Yudie had stayed in the city for no more than four days in total.</p>

  <p>After hearing all these things from Owen, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "So she isn't in the Oracle City now?"</p>

  <p>Owen shrugged and said, "I don't know, but most of the time, she isn't."</p>

  <p>If a Life and Death Realm expert didn't intentionally inform others of his or her movements, how could anybody track him or her?</p>

  <p>"She's too headstrong," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning suddenly muttered "Agreed" from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? What do you agree with?" Luo Luo Zheng turned to her and asked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning blinked once and smiled sweetly. "You are right! She's too willful!" she concurred.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, of course, understood what she was trying to say. He merely sighed in reply before turning around and following Owen towards their headquarters in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>After entering the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters, Owen immediately reported Luo Zheng's arrival at the city to his superiors. Soon, a servant came and led Luo Luo Zheng to the conference hall.</p>

  <p>In the past, the World Commercial Alliance had a strong business atmosphere. So warriors didn't think of it as one of the most powerful forces of the world. This was how the World Commercial Alliance gained a reputation for being weaker than the rest. In fact, some warriors described the World Commercial Alliance as a group of mercenary merchants.</p>

  <p>However, after the war between the World Commercial Alliance and the Heavenly Evil Sect had been declared, an earth-shattering change had occurred in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance had arranged over a hundred thousand runes around the Oracle City, forming a massive array formation. This formation was inferior to the Cloud Hall's Small Circulation Killing Array. What was more it was inferior even to the Ethereal Spirit Sect's sect-protecting array. However, its only advantage was the great number of runes.</p>

  <p>After all, the Oracle City's Runic Tower was where many great runic experts of the world gathered, and the wealth of the World Commercial Alliance was larger than all the other sects. They had arranged those runes without worrying about the cost, and they were undoubtedly very powerful.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed Owen to the conference hall of the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters. When he entered, he saw many familiar faces.</p>

  <p>Besides Morphens and other elders of the Cloud Hall, the three heads of the World Commercial Alliance were also present. The Ancient Tycoon in the Oracle City, however, wasn't there.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! You're finally here!" Dillon exclaimed in surprise, his round face turning red with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Shi, Mr. Yan, Mr. Mo," Luo Luo Zheng bowed his head to greet them.</p>

  <p>In fact, after the World Commercial Alliance heard the news that Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the Cloud Hall, they had asked Ning Yudie to summon Luo Luo Zheng to the Oracle City many times. However, she had evaded them each time saying he was in a secluded cultivation. Although the two forces had allied with each other, Luo Luo Zheng was actually a member of the Cloud Hall, so they couldn't intervene too much.</p>

  <p>After exchanging pleasantries briefly, Dillon said, "Luo Luo Zheng, now that you've come to the Oracle City, you'll cooperate with our World Commercial Alliance to fight Eddie, right?"</p>

  <p>Dillon worded his request cleverly. He knew that the conflict between Luo Luo Zheng and Eddie could not be resolved, so he didn't ask him to fight against the Heavenly Evil Sect but used Eddie's name instead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded tersely but replied firmly, "Of course."</p>

  <p>"Then please proceed to the Runic Tower. With your help, I believe that our chances of defeating Eddie will increase by at least twenty percent!" Dillon said excitedly.</p>

  <p>At least twenty percent...</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked by Dillon's words, but they quickly figured it out by themselves. If Luo Luo Zheng could create an array that was stronger than the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array, then, coupled with the strength of the World Commercial Alliance, their chance of winning would undoubtedly increase a lot.</p>

  <p>The only question was whether Luo Luo Zheng would agree.</p>
