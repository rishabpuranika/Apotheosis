<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Illusion Points that they had gathered on the second stage no longer determined their rankings in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Now, the elimination process had begun. If one's statue was destroyed, he or she would be eliminated straightaway.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all the warriors would invest their Illusion Points into their statues in order to strengthen them before the end of the prescribed time.</p>

  <p>They would have to spend 100, 000 Illusion Points strengthen their statues once, and even that wouldn't be enough.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong their statues could become, it was obviously impossible to expect the statues to fight. They all knew very well that they would have to rely on their own prowess and skills in the upcoming battle.</p>

  <p>So the warriors used their Illusion Points to enhance the defense of the statues. This was deemed to be the safest method. After all, the top 2, 500 warriors had absolute confidence in their own strength.</p>

  <p>The statues were made from some unknown stone. As long as they didn't break, their owners would not face elimination.</p>

  <p>A Purple Star had been engraved on the chest of every statue.</p>

  <p>As the statues gained strength, the number of the stars would increase.</p>

  <p>When the warriors intensified their statues for 100 times, it meant they had consumed 50 million Illusion Points, and a second Purple Star would appear on the chests of their statues.</p>

  <p>Most warriors had got over 50 million Illusion Points, and only those who were not above the 2, 000th rank had a slightly lower number of Illusion Points. Thus, after they had used up all the Illusion Points that they had been accumulating, a second Purple Star would appear.</p>

  <p>While they were strengthening their statues, a warrior clad in heavy armor brought his statue to the second floor.</p>

  <p>He had a square face and was kitted in extravagant equipment. In his left hand was an enormous shield, which was as tall as a man, while in his right hand he wielded a heavy silver sword. There was a wild look in his eyes, and his face looked as if it was carved out of stone. The statue behind him also held a similar shield and a sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was engrossed in methodically strengthening his statue when he saw a white light flash from the corner of his eye. He turned to glance at the newcomer and his eyebrows went up imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>The newcomer was ranked seventh in the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Studying his heavy equipment, Luo Zheng was somewhat impressed by him.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't know which force this man belonged to.</p>

  <p>When the man arrived, all the warriors began to whisper among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Look, it's Karl Jiang from the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>"It's said that he's a lunatic!"</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may, don't underestimate him. He's a Godly Genius of the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard these words, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>So this mysterious man was a Godly Genius?</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had already known that the Godly Genius was a martial artist whose Mahayana Lotus Flower was in full bloom. However, the newcomer had a strange expression on his face. Luo Zheng wondered which Godly Way he might have trained.</p>

  <p>"Karl Junior, await orders here!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>He used the heavy sword in his hand to point at a place. Following his command, his statue went and took his position, by kneeling down on one knee, bowing to his master.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>Warriors' statues were supposed to be their clones. Karl had just ordered his clone to kowtow to him. Was he really as crazy as people said? If so, how could a madman become a Godly Genius?</p>

  <p>Karl started browsing through the bamboo slips along with the others.</p>

  <p>He decided to choose to improve his statue's strength, so he exchanged all his Illusion Points for strength bamboo slips.</p>

  <p>As soon as he did that, rays of red light engulfed his statue. Every time the red light flashed, it meant that his statue had been strengthened. From the looks of it, he was preparing to only improve his statue's strength.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at him as though he was an idiot.</p>

  <p>The statue was as fragile as a clay doll, and a single touch would shatter it. What was the point of improving its strength?</p>

  <p>If he were to use his statue's punch, it would probably be smashed to smithereens. Didn't he intend to pass the second stage?</p>

  <p>"I've long heard that Karl Jiang from the Celestial Position is a strange guy. I finally met him today and it's true� he's no different than an idiot!" a martial artist ridiculed.</p>

  <p>Karl was staring at his statue in rapt attention. After hearing these words, he suddenly turned around and said to the martial artist, "Talking about others behind their backs is extremely immoral."</p>

  <p>Then he aimed the blade of his heavy sword towards the speaker, the shiny sword reflecting his face. He continued, "I have kept your face in my mind. I can't punish you here, but if we meet in the outside world, I definitely won't let you go!"</p>

  <p>He spoke seriously with an eerie expression. He wasn't joking at all. He would definitely do what he said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the warrior trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>No matter how stupid the others thought Karl was, he still was a Godly Genius of the Celestial Position. Furthermore, it was rumored that he never joked around and was always true to his word.</p>

  <p>Karl finished speaking and no longer paid attention to the warrior. He turned back to his statue and resumed spending more Illusion Points improving his statue's strength.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a purple light flashed, and a second Purple Star appeared on the chest of his statue. This meant that he had invested over 50 million Illusion Points. However, he did not plan to stop here. He continued strengthening his statue even more.</p>

  <p>Before long, a purple light once again flickered on the chest of his statue to everyone's surprise.</p>

  <p>He actually gained a third Purple Star!</p>

  <p>"How could he get a third Purple Star?"</p>

  <p>"This means he has more than 100 million Illusion Points! That's how a third Purple Star appeared!"</p>

  <p>"This fool has spent so many Illusion Points improving his statue's strength. What a waste!"</p>

  <p>No one knew how many Illusion Points were required to strengthen the statue layer by layer, so they could only do a rough estimate.</p>

  <p>But everyone knew that the Purple Stars on the statue showed the extent to which it had strengthened.</p>

  <p>Seeing the third Purple Star, they sighed in their hearts and shook their heads. Karl had so many Illusion Points, but he had wasted them improving only his statue's strength.</p>

  <p>There were two ways to reasonably strengthen the statue. One was to enhance its defense only, and the other was to enhance both� its defense as well as its strength, which was what Luo Zheng was doing. He didn't see any point in enhancing just its strength.</p>

  <p>But nobody informed Karl about this. Even if they did, he wouldn't listen.</p>

  <p>Zheng's game plan was very clear. After strengthening his statue with the speed bamboo slips, he began to strengthen it using the strength bamboo slips and the defense bamboo slips.</p>

  <p>However, just then, something strange occurred.</p>

  <p>Not long after he began, a purple light flashed on the chest of his own statue, and a second Purple Star appeared!</p>

  <p>According to everyone's calculations, the second star would cost 50 million Illusion Points, but Luo Zheng had consumed less than 8 million. So how could he have obtained the second Purple Star already?</p>

  <p>At this time, not everyone was paying attention to Karl.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Karl had won the seventh place in the Illusion Battlefield, which was quite a high rank, but it was unclear how many Illusion Points he had accumulated. Going by what was unfolding before them, they could make a rough estimate.</p>

  <p>Karl was still determinedly making his statue stronger and stronger. The other warriors held their breath as they stared at the scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a fourth Purple Star appeared.</p>

  <p>That meant Karl had at least 200 million Illusion Points in his kitty.</p>

  <p>The top 2, 500 warriors were a proud bunch. Since they had risen to the top 2, 500, they believed that the disparity between them and the powerhouses before them wasn't too great.</p>

  <p>However, Karl, who had over 200 million Illusion Points was only ranked number seven.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then how many Illusion Points did the warrior at the sixth place obtain?</p>

  <p>How about the one at the fifth place?</p>

  <p>And what about those in the top four?</p>

  <p>At this thought, they all looked shattered as they realized how much of a difference there was between themselves and the ace talents and Godly Geniuses before them.</p>

  <p>Their collective gasp attracted Zheng's gaze.</p>

  <p>"Does this guy really have 200 million Illusion Points?" Zheng's pupils contracted slightly.</p>

  <p>'Well, I know why, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>In the supreme world, he had obtained nearly 100 million Illusion Points, yet he was still unable to get to the first place. Obviously, the number one warrior possessed a lot of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The warriors on top of the list were incomparably strong, and the disparity between them was like a yawning chasm.</p>

  <p>A long time passed when Karl finally stopped strengthening his statue.</p>

  <p>The other warriors guessed that the number of his Illusion Points must be between 230 million and 240 million. It was less than 250 million, otherwise, he would have been able to get the fifth Purple Star.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also sped up his strengthening process now.</p>

  <p>He was confused. The second Purple Star appeared very early, so he thought his even distribution had a bigger impact on the statue's strength level.</p>

  <p>However, after he injected 20 million Illusion Points, a purple light flashed and the third Purple Star appeared.</p>
