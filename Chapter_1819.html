  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew he couldn't kill this woman, but it was impossible for her to understand what was going on in his mind.</p>

  <p>The riskiest part of his plan was this woman's strength.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had understood the situation and gotten an estimate of this woman's actual strength from his last two strikes.</p>

  <p>Just as he had speculated, this woman was just like Mu Ning. Despite their great talent and powerful strength, they had little experience in actual combat. This type of warrior never could fully exert their strength in line with their cultivation bases. However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know that his guess was only half right.</p>

  <p>His thinking was still limited by his experience from the original universe. He didn't realize that everything in the divine land was far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>This woman was not as simple as he thought she was.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng brought the woman to fly in reverse, Kennan and Woodrow, the two world lords, were scared out of their wits. The Spirit Transformation Realm warriors were also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Woodrow activated his life vitality and was about to chase after Luo Luo Zheng before he realized he had to ask Kennan. He didn't know what he could do to help the princess.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not only holding the princess hostage but was also taking her towards the Formless Sky Python. This was a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>"We have no other choice now. We can only fight it head on!" Kennan said as he crossed his hands and pressed his index fingers to his temples.</p>

  <p>"What?" Woodrow said, shocked at Kennan's actions.</p>

  <p>Kennan was decisive in his actions. He had never hesitated throughout the entire journey. No matter how much trouble the princess had caused, he always made the right decisions.</p>

  <p>Just like the way he had given up the idea of blocking the monster to stop Luo Zheng's attack when he noticed Luo Zheng's killing intent.</p>

  <p>And now, he had decided to save the princess at all costs. Although the princess didn't treasure her own life, her safety was always their top priority.</p>

  <p>"Dear Gods, please listen to my dearest wish! May the Immortal Gods show your grace and create a barrier to seal this evil beast!"</p>

  <p>A strong Mu Ning enveloped Kennan's body the moment he made this wish.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was finding it difficult to steady himself in the air under the impact of this Mu Ning. At the same time, he was shocked to find out that this world lord's Mu Ning had suddenly become as strong as that of a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>What the hell had happened when Kennan had recited those words? Why was he able to improve so much in the blink of an eye?</p>

  <p>Once Kennan had made his wish, countless blue crystals started to materialize and accumulate in the air in front of him, quickly forming a huge enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The giant Formless Sky Python was less than one thousand feet away from them. It could cover the distance in the blink of an eye. The enchanted barrier spread around and successfully sealed the Formless Sky Python within it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was surprised when the Formless Sky Python stopped moving.</p>

  <p>This beast could fight a Supreme Lord, but a world lord was able to seal it. How was this possible?</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that the way Luo Luo Zheng saw cultivation bases changed greatly.</p>

  <p>His old knowledge of cultivation bases was from the original universe.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how it was in other universes, nor did he know about the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the universe where he was born, every Supreme Lord carried a specific Heavenly Destiny. But there was no Supreme Lords in the divine land. Above the world lords were the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Though the world lords of the divine land couldn't carry Heavenly Destinies, they could cultivate a special skill called the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only ones who had grasped this skill.</p>

  <p>The Wishing Spell was powerful, but it also required a large price to be paid for it.</p>

  <p>It represented the strong obsession of a warrior.</p>

  <p>For example, if a man wanted to take revenge and kill the emperor of his country, he could use the Wishing Spell and swear to God that he would kill the emperor one day.</p>

  <p>He would gain additional power once the spell was cast successfully. His cultivation base and thinking ability would be greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, if the emperor suddenly died for other reasons before the warrior could carry out his plan of revenge, his Wishing Spell would remain unfulfilled.</p>

  <p>It would become an inner demon that would appear at his most vulnerable moment to land him a fatal blow. In the divine land, many people had been able to learn the Wishing Spell. After all, it was regarded as one of the many traditional skills in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But very few people were willing to use this skill because it had the potential for ruining their future.</p>

  <p>The moment Kennan had used this skill, he was filled with regret.</p>

  <p>This place was near the gray forest and was a relatively safe zone. As long as they did not go across the Glitter Gold Gobi and into the desert, they wouldn't be in any great danger.</p>

  <p>Still, the powerful creatures in the forest were not to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>The princess was now in a life-and-death situation because of her own willfulness, and Kennan had no other choice but to use the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>Since he had made the wish, he would have to kill the Formless Sky Python first if he wanted to improve his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was curious about this world lord's method, but he didn't stop to find out more and sprinted forward to escape.</p>

  <p>"Stop him, Woodrow!" Kennan exclaimed angrily.</p>

  <p>He had used the Wishing Spell to prevent the Formless Sky Python from hurting the princess. But since he needed to keep at the spell, he was not in a position to chase after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the Formless Sky Python, which was sealed inside the enchanted barrier, sensed that the princess was leaving, its huge body trembled, wanting to catch her.</p>

  <p>A cracking sound ripped through from the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The barrier looked like it would break even though it was created using the great power of the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>At the sound, Woodrow knew that Kennan wouldn't be able to hold on for long. So he led the group of Spirit Transformation Realm warriors to chase after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" the princess spoke suddenly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had carried her all the way back. They were now only 300 feet away from the Formless Sky Python. At such a close distance, they could clearly see a frightening pile of eyeballs growing on the giant monster's head.</p>

  <p>The princess was so terrified that even if Luo Luo Zheng hadn't held her tightly, she wouldn't have dared move an inch.</p>

  <p>But now, Kennan was controlling the Formless Sky Python, which was why she wasn't so afraid anymore and started berating Luo Luo Zheng loudly.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng only responded with a snort.</p>

  <p>There was no turning back for him, now that he held the princess hostage and escaped.</p>

  <p>Luckily, since the Formless Sky Python had distracted a world lord, he knew that he had made the right choice. The question was: How long would the world lord be able to control the beast? It had astonished Luo Luo Zheng that Kennan was able to seal the beast all by himself. Even some low-rank Supreme Lords did not have this ability.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng dared not lower his guard because there was another world lord chasing after him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mind continued to analyze the situation as he continued on his path to escape, the princess in his arms.</p>

  <p>"You brat! Let the princess go, and I will spare your life. Or you will regret for what you have done!" Woodrow's voice boomed threateningly as he chased after them.</p>

  <p>"Let the princess go!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know who we are?"</p>

  <p>"We won't kill you if you don't hurt the princess," the Spirit Transformation Realm guards began to shout, threatening Luo Luo Zheng and trying to placate him at the same time.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that their threats were only making Luo Luo Zheng even more determined to keep running. Luo Luo Zheng knew that the animosity between him and this group of warriors had already reached peak level. He had no choice but to take the princess hostage. Luckily, her body was slim enough that it didn't burden him.</p>

  <p>"You want to be stubborn? Don't blame me for not warning you!"</p>

  <p>Woodrow shouted and with a flip of his hand, a number of silver spikes appeared behind him. "Soul-chasing Spike!"</p>

  <p>The spikes flashed a cyan light as they spiraled and whizzed through the air and shot towards Luo Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng threw the princess behind him and used her body as a shield against the spikes.</p>

  <p>Woodrow's face darkened. He didn't dare hurt the princess with the Soul-chasing Spikes. So with an angry wave of his hand, he caused all the spikes to explode.</p>
