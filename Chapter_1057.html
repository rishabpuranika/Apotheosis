<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dillon sighed. It was not that he pitied Master Wallace. The almighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were born from tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of warriors. It took a lot of resources and time to reach the Soul Sea Realm, but it only took one quick moment to end them.</p>

  <p>This was the world of martial artists. Even if you stepped into the Soul Sea Realm and became an emperor, you still wouldn't be able to escape your fate.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult to kill a Soul Sea Realm warrior. Even in the four divine kingdoms, the death of a Soul Sea Realm warrior was an earth-shattering event.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace and Master Abraham had been too careless. They were surrounded by nine Soul Sea Realm warriors with nowhere to escape. This was why they had ended up in such a sorry state.</p>

  <p>The battle had only lasted for a short time before they were both killed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly floated into the air with his hands behind his back, arriving before the last surviving Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>He had answered Luo Zheng's question, so Miguel and the others let him go.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on his face. He was a powerhouse who had endured five life and death crises, and was stronger than Eddie. However, when he faced Luo Luo Zheng, who was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was petrified.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng knew he was not afraid of him, but the persons behind him.</p>

  <p>"You, you promised not to kill me," the warrior stammered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and laughed. "Yeah. I indeed agreed not to kill you, but I cannot let you stay in the Central Region, nor can I allow you to return to the York Divine Kingdom. What should I do? Do you have any ideas?"</p>

  <p>"Well..." The man's face froze. He had originally planned to say Luo Luo Zheng bullied him, but so what? Luo Luo Zheng could easily kill him. After all, he had not used his warrior spirit to take the oath.</p>

  <p>The warrior thought about it for a while and eventually shook his head. "I can't think of anything!"</p>

  <p>Not too far away from Luo Luo Zheng, Miguel faintly smiled. "It's simple. Just disable your skills!" It was a simple but cruel suggestion.</p>

  <p>A Life and Death Realm warrior whose cultivation was destroyed was as good as dead. But he had to pay a price for his life. Once he entered the Life and Death Realm, he would have to fight against the heavens' law. He still had to undergo the Small Heavenly Tribulations after he was disabled.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Tribulations began, they would follow a certain pattern and descend in an orderly manner at a fixed time without mistake.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Realm master had survived the last life and death crisis a hundred years ago. The sixth one would come soon and, this time, he did not have the confidence to face it, so he had decided to follow Master Wallace to the Central Region. Firstly, he wanted to gain some good fortune. Secondly, if Master Wallace agreed to help him, his chances of surviving the next life and death crisis would greatly increase.</p>

  <p>Once his skills were disabled, he would just be an ordinary person. How would he be able to withstand the next life and death crisis?</p>

  <p>So when he heard Miguel's words, he refuted angrily, "If you disable me, it's as good as killing me!"</p>

  <p>Miguel smiled coldly. "That's not a bad idea. Killing you is the easiest choice."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened as he looked at the Life and Death Realm powerhouse in front of him. Miguel would take the warrior's life with just a word from him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression made the Life and Death Realm warrior anxious. He was stubborn, but he was afraid of death. Moreover, he had already gone through five life and death crises. If he could survive the sixth, he would be able to start breaking through to the Soul Sea Realm. He might still have a good future ahead of him.</p>

  <p>The weather wasn't too hot, so he would be comfortable even if he was in a sea of fire. But at this moment, sweat was dripping off his forehead. After some consideration, he clenched his teeth and said, "I have an idea!"</p>

  <p>"Oh? What's it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously. From Luo Zheng's point of view, it was imperative to disable this person. If he couldn't, it would be safer to kill him.</p>

  <p>The main reason for this was that it was impossible for Miguel and the others to defend the Central Region forever. They had to return to the Sea God Continent and once they left, who would suppress this Life and Death Realm powerhouse?</p>

  <p>"There is a secret method in our divine kingdom. It's called slave seal. You can use it on me," the warrior said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Slave seal?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his eyes showing interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, those with slave seals cannot disobey their masters' orders, much less go against their masters' wills. They will be completely loyal to their masters. If you put the seal on me, you will be my master," the warrior explained hastily.</p>

  <p>"Is the slave seal really so powerful?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, staring at the man in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The man answered with absolute certainty.</p>

  <p>The slave seal was indeed domineering. Under this seal, he would still have his own thoughts, but he would unconditionally obey his master.</p>

  <p>Different from the warrior who chose to be enslaved on his own initiative, many arrogant warriors chose to die rather than have a slave seal imprinted.</p>

  <p>Life and Death Realm warriors wouldn't want to become slaves at the mercy of others.</p>

  <p>However, this particular Life and Death Realm warrior was rather afraid of death. If he was disabled, he would die. If not, he would be killed right there. On balance, he chose the slave seal to save his life.</p>

  <p>Maybe Luo Luo Zheng would pity him and release the slave seal one day. Who knew?</p>

  <p>This was the best solution he could think of in his desperation.</p>

  <p>"The slave seal sounds magical. How does one use it?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>The warrior quickly took out a small, brown stone tablet from his space ring. On it was an incomparably exquisite rune.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw the rune, his eyebrows throbbed slightly. 'Is it a divine texture?' thought Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon answered from within. "Yes, it is indeed."</p>

  <p>"Why have I never seen this type of divine texture before?" Luo Luo Zheng asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>He never ignored his divine texture skills when he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>Although he was unable to inscribe all of the divine textures that the cyan dragon taught him, the principles and shapes of all the divine textures were firmly etched in his mind.</p>

  <p>All but this one.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon replied with a faint smile, "It's normal that you don't remember it, because you really haven't seen it before. Divine texture techniques are not unique to my clan. The ones that I taught you are passed down in the Genuine Dragon race, while the divine texture in his hand is inherited from the human race. Only humans have the need to develop such a divine texture to enslave others."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was proficient in the divine texture technique. It appeared as though he was looking down on this type of divine texture.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, wanting to be a hundred percent sure. He would soon step into the four divine kingdoms. If he had a Life and Death Realm powerhouse as a guide, it would save a lot of time and effort.</p>

  <p>But if he was tricked by this fellow, then he might cause trouble in the Central Region once Miguel and the others left. Luo Luo Zheng wanted to avoid this at all costs.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon nodded affirmatively. "This is a very common slave seal.</p>

  <p>Once enslaved, he will not be able to resist, but there is a requirement. That is, your soul force must be stronger than his. If not, the slave seal will turn against you."</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Luo Zheng was very confident of his soul.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace's soul had only reached the Fighting Soul Realm. Luo Luo Zheng was sure that this Life and Death Realm warrior's soul couldn't be stronger than his own soul.</p>

  <p>He said to the warrior, "Well then, I will enslave you."</p>

  <p>The warrior was reluctant for a moment. However, even if he was having second thoughts, he didn't have any other choice. He tossed the brown stone token at Luo Luo Zheng gloomily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently caressed the divine texture as he infused his life vitality into it, instantly activating the slave seal. Then he directed the slave seal towards the warrior.</p>

  <p>The seal instantly stuck to the warrior's forehead, releasing a little bit of light. When the light on his forehead disappeared, he had a dull look in his eyes. "My master, do you have any instructions?" He nodded to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled wickedly and said, "I want you to kill yourself."</p>
