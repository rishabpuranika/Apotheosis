  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings fell silent at Zheng's plan to recover the Nine Li race's glory.</p>

  <p>No matter what stand they took, it was hard for them to wrap their minds around the situation.</p>

  <p>If the Nine Li race actually returned to the divine land, they'd take up a lot of resources.</p>

  <p>The powerful clans, as well as the other divine citizens residing in the divine land, would have to face keen competition. There was no way they could compete with the race that created this world!</p>

  <p>Alas, they had no choice. None of them could object to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, what Zheng said was actually reasonable. The divine land belonged to the Nine Li race. They were doing this only to return the divine land to its rightful owner.</p>

  <p>Ian cleared his throat. "However, in the future, if the Nine Li race grows in strength, how can we possibly live in peace with them?"</p>

  <p>"I will make new rules," Zheng replied reassuringly. "In the future, warriors won't need to fight for the titles of Holy Beings with their lives at risk, but fight for the top places on the Jade Wall of Legends. Only the strongest ones will be allowed to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>The fight for the holy springs in the Mountain of Holy Beings was too tragic. There was too much loss of life. Zheng's goal was to change this situation.</p>

  <p>That was a good suggestion. The death of the consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings had been a great loss for the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Holy Beings had also discussed the possibility of fighting for the titles of Holy Beings according to the rankings on the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>However, the titles of the Holy Beings were a fatal temptation to the True Gods. Every time the Mountain of Holy Beings came, the powerful clans would fight intensely for the titles.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could end this dire situation, they would be pleased to agree.</p>

  <p>"But the Sacred race... No. The Nine Li people are from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Those who carry the blood of the Nine Li race are surely stronger than us.</p>

  <p>How could we possibly compete with them?" a Holy Being of the Qin Clan asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Even though the Sacred race had been gone for countless divine eras, their power was no secret. The Holy Beings were fully aware of their strength, as told by the stories.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could reply, Lorena sneered. "Do you mean that we, the Nine Li people, have to humor you just because we are outstanding? Maybe you need to be reminded as to who the true owner of the divine land is."</p>

  <p>Lorena's eyes flashed with anger. Of course her approach was more aggressive than that of Zheng; in her eyes, the divine land was the last home of the Nine Li race. After her people were slaughtered by Leyton, the divine citizens took their land.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being of the Qin Clan opened his mouth as if to protest, but no words came out.</p>

  <p>He had to admit that what Lorena said was rational. In addition, her race was strong.</p>

  <p>"The divine land is not a peaceful place," Zheng said after a while. "As you all know, its owner has deadly enemies who bring the Yellow Emperor Guards here. No one can guarantee that they won't attack us again, so we have to grow stronger together to resist them as a whole. We don't need to discuss the strife of different races."</p>

  <p>It was said that, in war, the winners became rulers while the losers were reduced to bandits. This saying reigned throughout the chaos.</p>

  <p>If the divine citizens didn't want to be eliminated, they had to force themselves to become stronger.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to unite all the people in the divine land. He didn't need to discuss this with the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Father, what should we do about the feud between you and Murphy?" Zheng turned his gaze towards Murphy.</p>

  <p>'Finally!' Murphy thought nervously, his heart pounding.</p>

  <p>But since he chose not to run away, he turned to face Mike.</p>

  <p>Lorena's eyes flashed coldly. She had no sympathy for the person who almost killed her husband.</p>

  <p>Mike stared back at Murphy but kept silent for a few moments.</p>

  <p>Back then, Bromley and Holy Jay had arranged various methods to deal with the universe war that Murphy started.</p>

  <p>But Mike's true enemy was Nicholas. Murphy was but a pawn.</p>

  <p>It was not that Mike hated Murphy. Actually, if it weren't for Nicholas, Mike wouldn't even bat an eyelash at Murphy.</p>

  <p>"You almost destroyed my Evolutionary Universe, but at last you have lost the universe war. I know you just worked for Nicholas. Now, Nicholas is dead. Let's write off all our old scores. I won't kill you, but I will take your title as a Holy Being. What say you?" asked Mike, raising an eyebrow at Murphy.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the Rebirth Lands could be taken away. It was a bit troublesome, but with Zheng's current strength, doing so would be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Murphy trembled at Mike's words. Even the other Holy Beings felt sorry for him.</p>

  <p>It was more painful to strip him of his title as a Holy Being than to kill him.</p>

  <p>After all, his current strength, power, and the rise of his clan were all thanks to his title as a Holy Being. If he lost the Murphy Universe, then he would be demoted to a consummate True God, which made him feel like he had lost everything he worked for.</p>

  <p>However, ultimately, it was better than death. As long as he was still alive, he could wait for the next arrival of the Mountain of Holy Beings and become a Holy Being again.</p>

  <p>Murphy pondered over his options for a while. It was no use. He knew he had no choice. "This is a light punishment. I'm willing to accept it."</p>

  <p>After Murphy was stripped of his title as a Holy Being, Clark, Jeremiah and Zeke exchanged glances nervously.</p>

  <p>As members of the alliance of powerful clans, they had attacked Zheng both openly and secretly. It would be terrible if they were reduced to consummate True Gods as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed the worried looks of these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>He would certainly punish the members of the former alliance of the powerful clans, but not today. "This meeting is adjourned. You may leave now." He turned to Murphy. "I have to go to the Floating Island of the Mu Clan."</p>

  <p>Murphy's eyes widened in astonishment. "What are you going to do on my clan's Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>"Take me to meet Nelly," said Zheng. His gaze softened at the mention of Nelly's name.</p>

  <p>Nelly was locked up by Rachelle because of him, so she should still be on the Floating Island of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>Murphy submissively led Zheng to the Floating Island of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings returned to their respective Floating Islands. Mike, Lorena, and Sword Chen returned to the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The new Holy Beings, including Cade, left the meeting hall with mixed feelings bubbling up inside them.</p>

  <p>In the past, they had regarded the Holy Beings as the top-level warriors; becoming Holy Beings had been their ultimate goal. But just now, they witnessed the older Holy Beings were all submissive to Zheng.</p>

  <p>They bitterly recalled how Murphy dared not even resist when his title as a Holy Being was taken away from him.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, their esteemed view of Holy Beings was shattered; they weren't as strong as they had imagined.</p>

  <p>There was a cliff in the west of the Floating Island of the Mu Clan. Its surface was so smooth that people could observe their shadows on its surface clearly.</p>

  <p>"Nelly is locked inside. It was Rachelle who ordered to lock her up," explained Murphy almost apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I know."</p>

  <p>Rachelle had told Zheng in person, so he was well aware of the situation.</p>

  <p>He walked along the cliff and passed a corner. Suddenly, a figure appeared before him.</p>
