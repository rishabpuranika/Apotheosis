<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was true that the Evil God had merged more Godly Ways than Zheng ever had.</p>

  <p>He only needed one more Godly Way to completely finish the cause. It was unbelievable for him to achieve this with his current cultivation base.</p>

  <p>If this happened before, Zheng probably would have waited before doing anything, just to see what the Godly Ways Great Unity could produce.</p>

  <p>However, with the help of the Regal Jade Spirit, Zheng had already grasped that the chaos was imperfect.</p>

  <p>Among the three flaws, Zheng obtained one through the Regal Jade Civilization. He was able to claim the Blood Essence Godly Way, but the remaining two were still a mystery to him.</p>

  <p>After his son, Geoffrey, deciphered and interpreted the Sanskrit word formed by blood vitality, he gathered some clues for his search. The Regal Jade Spirit had guessed that one of the flaws stood close to the Element Spirit race, otherwise known as the second civilization. But the exact existence was still unknown.</p>

  <p>Little did he know that the Evil God had already gotten a flaw!</p>

  <p>He also didn't know if the power within the arc light was a gift from the Black Ship to the Evil God or he obtained it from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was a proud, arrogant being, who was very keen on showing the unique energy he had obtained.</p>

  <p>For him, Godly Ways Great Unity was just round the corner.</p>

  <p>The only thing that bothered him was that his energy had a way of clashing with the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>He attempted over a million times, with no success whatsoever.</p>

  <p>He removed the Thunderstorm Godly Way and placed the arc light together with the other Godly Ways. In this way, the three thousand Godly Ways stabilized to his advantage.</p>

  <p>The reverse of this also worked wonders. However, the moment the two forces were added to the Godly Ways at the same time, the Ways-blending Energy would collapse.</p>

  <p>The arc light proved to be a form of thunder, one that was violent and difficult to control. That was what made it so incompatible with the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>All things considered, the Evil God had tried all methods only to meet failure.</p>

  <p>He even attempted to use the Other Shore Power in order to suppress and force the two thunder energies to merge. However, like all of his trials, this failed as well.</p>

  <p>What Zheng said stunned the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"What did you say? There is more than one flaw?" The Evil God gave Zheng a look of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Those who remained in the Chaotic Source World didn't dare to say a word after Zheng spoke. It was met with silence.</p>

  <p>After all, they had no business with the Ways-blending Energy. They thought it was not that extraordinary, except Mount, who was not like the others.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was causing a disruption in the area. Anyone who didn't pay attention would be crushed by her.</p>

  <p>As everyone ran for their lives, Mount and Mya decided to take action.</p>

  <p>Mya's curly hair began to extend to tens of thousands of feet as her face was finally revealed. Her piercing, blue eyes were focused, and she manipulated her hair to wrap itself around the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Even though the mother was much stronger, she couldn't help but be bothered by the messiness of the hair being wrapped around her.</p>

  <p>After Mya was able to successfully restrict her movement, Mount began to suppress her.</p>

  <p>As he did so, he heard Zheng's words despite the noise. He was deep in thought, and his body trembled in surprise. He looked at Zheng in pure astonishment.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Fuxi, who remained outside the Chaotic Source World, raised his eyebrows. "There is more than one flaw in the Ways-blending Energy? How could this be? If it's true, how many flaws are there?"</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the creature that appeared at the edge of the Icy Snow Province, he would have just asked Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>What puzzled Fuxi even more wasn't the fact that there were more flaws, but that Zheng had known it all along.</p>

  <p>It was known that three thousand Godly Ways were formed directly through the chaotic energy. The chaos was composed of Dark and Light energies, and these two energies transformed into the five mighty elements. These were the elements that created all things that existed.</p>

  <p>In effect, the energy that was constantly divided was considered the internal momentum of the three thousand Godly Ways, otherwise known as the basis to form all chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>This meant that if any flaws existed, then the chaotic energy and the chaos would have flaws.</p>

  <p>Zheng glared at the Evil God, his body pulsing with adrenaline. "Yes," he said.</p>

  <p>"There is more than one."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" the Evil God questioned, doubting the existence of more flaws.</p>

  <p>But as much as he wanted to prove Zheng was wrong, he knew Zheng was not one to lie.</p>

  <p>The Evil God discovered the flaw by chance. Having almost died on the Other Shore, he risked his life just to obtain the arc light.</p>

  <p>Could it be that Zheng had discovered something, too?</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was where he found other flaws?</p>

  <p>"But why should I tell you?" Zheng taunted.</p>

  <p>This was a bust to the Evil God's ego. He narrowed his eyes, and a hint of vengeance flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although he was known to be extremely arrogant in front of Zheng, he still had deep reverence for him.</p>

  <p>Shera helped him block any contact with the Rebirth Land, keeping him away from Zheng's control. However, no matter how hard he tried, he was still a product of Zheng's inner world. The fact that Zheng was his creator couldn't be ignored.</p>

  <p>With that being said, Evil God was determined to know all of Zheng's secrets.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to tell me anything," the Evil God smirked, "I just have to devour you."</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Evil God's aura soared towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The turbulent Ways-blending Energy began to spread out, ready to attack. It radiated magnificent colors as it morphed into a diamond-shaped sword.</p>

  <p>With the sword in hand, the Evil God charged towards Zheng in a swift movement.</p>

  <p>"Brother! Watch out!" Yan called out from above.</p>

  <p>"It is useless, you fools!" As the Evil God chuckled, he swung his huge sword across the air, leaving a trail of colors before waving it towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Just then, a red circle of light spread out, and the force of fear from it began to attack the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The highly condensed Ways-blending Energy was extremely unstable.</p>

  <p>Affected by the force of fear, the Evil God couldn't control the Ways-blending Energy. Just like that, it exploded, resembling a huge, blazing sun.</p>

  <p>With the amount of energy that had been released, even the Evil God himself would have to suffer if attacked by it. At the expense of his energy, he tried to suppress the fear and flew backward, giving him a chance to dodge.</p>

  <p>Yan, with the silk cloth in one hand, gently sprinkled the Braveness Rain across Zheng's body to remove the force of fear. "I didn't ask my brother to watch out for you," she mumbled.</p>

  <p>The Evil God calmed himself down as much as he could before turning his head.</p>

  <p>The eye was restrained by the silk cloth in Yan's hand. He couldn't defeat the eye alone.</p>

  <p>He stood no chance against Zheng and the force of fear of the eye.</p>

  <p>Clenching his teeth, he turned around and dashed to the side of the main peak without another word.</p>

  <p>"Brother, must we chase after him?" asked Yan, staring at the black figure that grew smaller the farther it went.</p>

  <p>"Do you honestly think that eye will help us?" Zheng shot a question back at her, smiling.</p>

  <p>"No." Yan shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then we take that eye down first," Zheng said.</p>
