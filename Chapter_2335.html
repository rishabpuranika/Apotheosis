<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone steered clear of the orange light ball after seeing the top-rank True God's miserable condition after touching it.</p>

  <p>After rolling, the ball then began to float strangely.</p>

  <p>At the same time, more orange light balls emerged from the other three ashes.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>In no time at all, the fist-sized balls suddenly began to emit rays of light.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the light burst was incredibly fast and the rays of light connected themselves to every True God.</p>

  <p>Some tried to dodge but it proved impossible.</p>

  <p>Zheng was no exception. A ray of light shot straight at his chest. He raised his hand to touch it but it did not fluctuate at all.</p>

  <p>This was only for a brief moment. The four light balls soon disappeared along with the light rays that connected with everyone present.</p>

  <p>However, despite the disappearance of the light, Zheng found three orange lines inscribed on his chest.</p>

  <p>These lines weren't divine textures nor were they Sanskrit. They were somewhat similar to the textures on the Abyss Demons' bodies. Zheng couldn't be too sure of the purpose of these textures since he had never seen them before.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these?" a True God huffed, placing his hand on his chest, trying to activate the lines.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, his attempt actually worked.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A burst of golden light appeared from the orange lines and enveloped the True God. It was the exact light that flickered on the bodies of the Abyss Demons.</p>

  <p>"Wait! What's going on?" The True God couldn't understand what was happening and was now in a state of mild panic.</p>

  <p>Nobody could offer him an answer and simply stared, not really knowing how to help him.</p>

  <p>Outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land, the Holy Beings also noticed the movement in the valley.</p>

  <p>"They're quite lucky. They were actually able to get three Promises of Absolute Beginning after killing those Abyss Demons," Clark remarked with laughter.</p>

  <p>"This is quite an achievement for them. Although the Abyss Demons weren't very powerful, ordinary True Gods wouldn't have been able to defeat them," one of the Demi-holy Beings remarked with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were well aware of the trials and dangers within the Abyss Demon Region. A Demi-holy Being would never dare to venture forth without the necessary precautions, let alone a consummate True God. The Faith Energy gathered there bore the malice of all living creatures from countless divine eras; thus, the monsters there were beyond control.</p>

  <p>"Tell them that the Promises of Absolute Beginning are extremely precious. Don't use them at will," Nicolas said, sending a message to Soren.</p>

  <p>Back at the valley, everyone still focused on the golden True God.</p>

  <p>None of them knew what a Promise of Absolute Beginning was but they absolutely felt the power of this golden light before.</p>

  <p>When this golden light appeared on the bodies of those Abyss Demons, they immediately broke free from all limits. Any power from their internal momentum was useless, and the speed of the Abyss Demons was greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>After Soren received Nicholas's message, a look of great joy broke through his face though he tried his best not to show it. Clearing his throat, he sent a calm and cool message. "The Holy Emperor of my clan said that this golden light is called the Promise of Absolute Beginning. It is supposedly a promise passed down from the ancient divine land. Once activated, it can resist all internal momentum during a short amount of time."</p>

  <p>"The Promise of Absolute Beginning?"</p>

  <p>"It can resist all the internal momentum?!"</p>

  <p>"Wow! We are so lucky!"</p>

  <p>There was a look of ecstasy on each True God's face as they looked down at the three lines etched on their chests.</p>

  <p>These lines were very eye-catching in the beginning but had now begun to dull down and gradually fade into their bodies.</p>

  <p>All True Gods and Holy Beings in the divine land used Faith Energy from their inner worlds to activate the internal momentum of their Godly Tiles and display theurgies. The Promise of Absolute Beginning was able to resist any theurgy with the foundation of internal momentum, and the user would be impervious to enemy attack during a certain period of time.</p>

  <p>"So these golden lines can resist all the internal momentum?" Zheng also remarked in surprise, not quite expecting such a great gift. The value of these three lines was now immeasurable. It would be enough to turn things around if a single line was activated during a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>Activating a Promise of Absolute Beginning could prove extremely handy against those Time Ghosts. It was unfortunate that they could only use it three times.</p>

  <p>Given its power though, perhaps they should be thankful that they were all given three chances to use it.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were naturally overjoyed after hearing Soren's words.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the True God who prematurely activated his Promise of Absolute Beginning felt morose. He wasted such a precious thing by mistake.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't the most depressed out of everyone.</p>

  <p>Several True Gods fled to the Star Door early and were transported to another Star Door outside the valley. They had now returned and saw the three faint lines on everyone's chest. Hearing Soren's explanation as to the purpose of these lines, they immediately regretted their earlier decision that led to them missing such a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>Zheng returned to the Goddess Statue and simply waited for the next wave of beasts to attack.</p>

  <p>After Zheng cut off the arm of an Abyss Demon earlier, it had been dragged all the way down to the Goddess Statue by the top-rank True God of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>The arm still held on tightly to Aleyna and Nelly. It took quite a lot of effort for the Mu Clan and Han Clan to rescue them.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, you saved my life again!" Aleyna said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Nelly stared at Zheng for quite a bit before muttering her gratitude, "Thank you."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in reply. He didn't really mean to save Nelly. Had he been caught by the Abyss Demon then he would've surely died.</p>

  <p>This wasn't a secret for Nelly. She knew perfectly that if it wasn't for Aleyna, then Zheng wouldn't have taken such a big risk.</p>

  <p>"How to share this arm?" Pascal asked out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>The four Abyss Demons were all burned to ashes in the flames but the arm Zheng had cut down remained intact.</p>

  <p>"Fiends' bones are very valuable. It should go to my clan," Nelly said, chin raised up high with conviction.</p>

  <p>"That's right!" The top-rank True God of the Mu Clan nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Pascal sneered, "That doesn't make sense. Is the Mu Clan's name carved on this arm?"</p>

  <p>"Right. Why should it belong to you?" Kelsey retorted.</p>

  <p>"Well, why should it belong to either of you?" a top-rank True God from the Fang Clan said with an arrogant laugh.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the Han Clan and the Mu Clan that were interested in getting the arm.</p>

  <p>The True Gods didn't know much about the Abyss Demon Region but they heard a couple of things here and there. Fiends' bones were supposedly very useful, especially in refining pills. The Fang Clan's famous Fiend Soul Pill, for example, required such an ingredient. Very few True Gods dared venture forth in the Abyss Demon Region, so the fiends' bones were very rare.</p>

  <p>A tense atmosphere hung over everyone over the ownership of the broken arm.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods initially showed little interest in the arm, but after seeing the True God of the Fang Clan get involved, they figured this was something that was worth a lot.</p>

  <p>"Cut the arm and share the pieces with each other!"</p>

  <p>"This bone is extremely strong. How long will it take?"</p>

  <p>"Sharing it equally is indeed a good idea."</p>

  <p>The Han Clan was extremely weak in terms of power standing. No top-rank True God from the clan got invited to the Astronomical Transit Day, only two consummate ones, but they were not here right now.</p>

  <p>Seeing the beginnings of what seemed to be a messy dispute, Reginald took a neutral stance. "Let's not argue. We've got such a good reward in the fourth round, so the next prize must be better. It's not good to break the peace and harmony over an arm. I've got an idea: whoever cut the arm should be the owner."</p>

  <p>With that suggestion, Reginald looked at Zheng meaningfully.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods also turned to look at him. Some of them completely forgot that the arm was actually cut down by this low-rank True God.</p>
