  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing the disciples who had just reached the Illuminating Soul Realm laugh at Luo Zheng, Kenneth was a little annoyed. He was clear why Luo Zheng had been abstracted. He shouted, "Before laughing at the others, you should make sure your competence is higher than them at least!" Then he turned to Luo Zheng and said, "You have known something about the space rules via the space windstorm, right? It's normal that you felt a little dizzy and you will be okay after you get used to it. Even we, the old generation, are interested in learning the space rules. However, only very few people understand the rules. You should consolidate what you have learned and properly use it in the future."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and answered, "I got it."</p>

  <p>'What?' Hearing what Kenneth said, Eddy was shocked. From the way Kenneth talked, Eddy could tell that he wasn't lying. Besides, it was said that there were some truly gifted disciples who could understand the space rules in the space tunnel and some incredible gifted disciples had cultivated according to the space rules via space windstorm.</p>

  <p>Eddy stared at Luo Zheng for a while and then shook his head. "Kenneth, I don't believe it!" He was clear what it meant to understand even a little bit about the space rules. Although Kenneth and he had reached a high cultivation level, they hadn't had an opportunity to learn the space rules, not to mention cultivate the rules.</p>

  <p>Kenneth said with a shrug, "Eddy, I was not talking to you and nobody will force you to believe."</p>

  <p>"He is talking big! It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a practitioner at grade three of the nature level could understand the space rules!"</p>

  <p>After all, the disciples of Red Sect came from the Central Region, so they were experienced and knowledgeable. Some of them had heard about space rules, but none of them had ever seen it, so they didn't believe that Luo Zheng had seen it. They thought Kenneth had said so deliberately to save face.</p>

  <p>In fact, Eddy thought the same way.</p>

  <p>'Talking big?' Luo Zheng raised one of his brows. Although he was dizzy, he had heard the sarcastic remarks about Cloud Sect from Eddy and his disciples. Since Kenneth had a high expectation of him, he wasn't going to let him down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spoke in a quick and rapid streak, "Since all the disciples of Red Sect could speak at will, then as the disciple of the Cloud Sect in Eastern Region, I would like to tell you what I'm thinking. In my opinion, Red Sect is nothing but crap! Although you have nine practitioners at the Illuminating Soul Realm here, none of them is match for me! I'll knock their teeth out!"</p>

  <p>Nobody expected Luo Zheng to put it so bluntly. Even Kenneth was shocked.</p>

  <p>'The young man is my type!' Kenneth thought.</p>

  <p>Kenneth had a bold nature, so he particularly disliked those yes-men. He was satisfied with what Luo Zheng had said. He knew that Luo Zheng had said that for the dignity of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The buzz of angry outcry rose among the disciples of Red Sect.</p>

  <p>If it was Patrick who had spoken like that, they might not be so angry.</p>

  <p>However, when it came to a practitioner at grade three of the nature level, things were different.</p>

  <p>"Hey, the guy from Eastern Region! Who the hell do you think you are?</p>

  <p>How dare you say we are crap? If you are powerful, you should have the guts to compete us. Otherwise, you're just a talker! A braggart!"</p>

  <p>"It is inconceivable that a practitioner at the third grade of the nature level should dare to say that the practitioners at Illuminating Soul Realm are crap! It seems we have to compete with him to prove ourselves!" the disciples of Red Sect shouted. Obviously, they wouldn't let go of Luo Zheng if he didn't accept their challenge.</p>

  <p>Neither Kenneth nor Eddy spoke. They were planning to have their own disciples to suppress each other's disciples.</p>

  <p>Just then, Tianming approached the crowd and said, "Since Luo Zheng ranked first in our All Peaks Competition, he is the best disciple of our Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>You should challenge me first. If you can't defeat me, then you don't have any chance of beating Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"What? That young man is the best disciple in your Cloud Sect?"</p>

  <p>Many disciples of Red Sect dropped their jaws to the floor in surprise.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with Cloud Sect? Why is the disciple at a lower cultivation level more powerful than those at higher cultivation levels?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>It didn't make sense for the lower member of Cloud Sect to be the most powerful. Of the three disciples of Cloud Sect, Patrick should be the most powerful. Sitting next to him should be Tianming. Following behind the other two should be Luo Zheng. Having just reached grade three of the nature level, Luo Zheng should be much inferior to the other two in competence and power.</p>

  <p>So when Tianming said that Luo Zheng ranked first, the disciples of Red Sect could hardly believe it.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's defeat the guy with a sword on his back first before giving a lesson to the guy at the third grade of the nature level," a bald young man who had just reached the Illuminating Soul Realm snorted.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, another disciple in Red Sect said at once, "Akiba, you don't have to fight them in person. Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Akiba, you're the best disciple in Red Sect, so it's not necessary for you to fight them in person. They're not worth it!"</p>

  <p>Akiba shook his head and said, "You should conserve your strength so that you can perform well in the process of the Cloud Road test. It won't consume me too much energy to defeat them."</p>

  <p>When they were talking, all the disciples had reached their destination, a semicircular platform.</p>

  <p>At the end of the platform was the entrance of the Cloud Road. Now.</p>

  <p>Everyone was focusing on the competition between the best disciples of the two Sects.</p>

  <p>After landing, Eddy chuckled and said, "Akiba, it's just a competition.</p>

  <p>We have the same origin with this Cloud Sect, so you should be careful not to hurt its disciples."</p>

  <p>Eddy's insincerity showed with the glint in his eyes and the way that he brushed off the word competition. If he had not indulged his disciples to provoke the others, the 'competition' would not happen. Now there was still some time before the start of the Cloud Road. Among the sects under the jurisdiction of Cloud Hall, only the disciples of Cloud Sect and Red Sect had shown up. The disciples of Iridescence Sect, Auspice Sect, Brumous Sect and Cloud Hall hadn't arrived yet, so Kenneth wanted to have his disciples compete with the disciples of Red Sect. He had great confidence in his disciples.</p>

  <p>He didn't worry about Luo Zheng, because Luo Zheng had never let him down, and sometimes, his performance had even shocked him. Patrick was powerful in competence and stable in performance. Tianming was very gifted, and his achievement in sword method had reached an incredibly high level.</p>

  <p>They could rank top three in any session of All Peaks Competition. So many gifted disciples had emerged in this All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Kenneth smiled cunningly. He patted Tianming on the shoulder and said, "If you can defeat him, I will give you a middle-grade fairy sword as reward!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Tianming became exited. He had already had a lower-grade fairy sword. However, as a man addicted to excellent swords, the more, the better. Even if he didn't have any chance to use it in the future, he could put it in his collection.</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, don't worry. I won't let you down!"</p>

  <p>Tianming was on par with where Evan had been three years ago. Because of this, he was extremely confident in his own competence. Without Patrick and Luo Zheng in the competition, Tianming would have ranked first in the All Peaks Competition of this session.</p>

  <p>After the crowd stepped back, Tianming and Akiba were left on the spacious platform. They stood face to face.</p>

  <p>Akiba shook his head and said, "You're Tianming, right? I don't think you have the qualification to be my opponent."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Tianming asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"Because I rank first in Red Sect, but you only rank third in Cloud Sect,"</p>

  <p>Akiba snorted, "You should be flattered to have the opportunity to compete against me!"</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Tianming's normally emotionless face. "I agree with what Luo Zheng just said. Red Sect sucks! Even the competence of its best disciple is just so-so." With that, Tianming drew his Blood-corroding Sword from the sheath.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Akiba laughed hysterically and then pulled his sword out.</p>

  <p>The sword was cyan in color and it obviously was a middle-grade fairy weapon. "This sword is called Dragon Sword. It is a middle-grade fairy weapon. Since the grade of my weapon is higher than yours, I will show you what successful sword intent is!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the other disciples of Red Sect were pleased. They didn't hold All Peaks Competition like Cloud Sect did, and they held Sect Competition instead. In this year's Sect Competition, Akiba had shown incredible competence and defeated all his opponents depending on his successful sword intent.</p>

  <p>"Akiba, come on! Show these people what successful sword intent is!"</p>

  <p>"Haha! I guess they will be frightened out of their wits!"</p>

  <p>"Akiba is only nineteen years old. However, he has already comprehended successful sword intent. I believe he will be a great master of swordsmanship in the future. What he has achieved is good enough even in the whole Central Region!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Patrick and Tianming were all puzzled.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, successful sword intent was not that powerful, so they wondered why it was worth bragging about? They couldn't believe the level of the disciple who had ranked first in the Sect Competition was so low!</p>
