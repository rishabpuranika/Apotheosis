<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3375 An Amber Crystal </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Some races in the Black Mountain Guild were superior in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>However, all creatures who joined the Black Mountain Guild were violent and vicious.</p>

  <p>They were raised to be independent creatures. Without the support or protection of other powerful warriors, they had to rely on their own strength for survival.</p>

  <p>The winners would advance further, while the losers had to pay the penalty of death.</p>

  <p>The Evil God knew about the Latent token.</p>

  <p>But the members of the Black Mountain Guild didn't have any of them.</p>

  <p>The Evil God attempted to remove the enamel that enwrapped Garrett with his Ways-blending Energy. After several failed tries, he realized it was to no avail.</p>

  <p>Tenacious as he was, he refused to give up. Just as he was about to pull out his Other Shore Token, he heard mocking laughter coming from near him.</p>

  <p>He immediately turned his head to find two human beings from the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>These two had been standing at a safe distance of a thousand feet away from the Evil God. He was so engrossed that he didn't notice their presence.</p>

  <p>After they made themselves known, he was instantly alerted.</p>

  <p>"What's so funny?" the Evil God sneered as he narrowed his eyes to glare at Mya.</p>

  <p>It was obvious Mya was trying to get on his nerves. He was always ready to fight off anyone who dared to annoy him.</p>

  <p>While Mount carried Mya's body, he gathered strength secretly. Although both of them displayed relaxed expressions, they knew they shouldn't underestimate the man in black. All the strong warriors had one attribute in common. They were confident in their skills, but they weren't conceited.</p>

  <p>Mya smirked and raised her arm upwards. She pointed at the black smog and said, "You can't touch him. It's a Latent token made from an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-One. You cannot break it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh? Really?" The Evil God arched one brow upwards and scoffed. The corners of his mouth turned into a sly smile. He didn't seem to take her words seriously.</p>

  <p>Since he was unsuccessful in breaking the Latent token, he decided to let it go for the moment. Mya and Mount remained where they stood and didn't run away. He looked at them with vicious intents as though they were his next prey.</p>

  <p>With quick steps, he began to make his way towards them.</p>

  <p>Mya shook her head disapprovingly and said, "You don't have time to fight with us now."</p>

  <p>"And why is that?" The Evil God shook off her words as he continued to gather his strength while he walked.</p>

  <p>"Because the hurricane is coming once again. You'll be swept up before you even get here," Mya said as she smirked while pointing in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stopped in his tracks with a trace of doubt shadowing his face. At this moment, the black smog of the Chaotic Source World began to surge again. It didn't take long before a huge force made its way towards the Evil God and swept him off his feet and into the sky.</p>

  <p>Mya, Mount, and Garrett who was still sealed up by the enamel had all been swept up in the air along with him.</p>

  <p>The hurricane swirled around the Chaotic Source World. Any living being within close range of it would be tossed thousands of miles away whenever it came.</p>

  <p>Trying to get back at her, the Evil God attempted to resist the pressure of the hurricane and made his way towards Mya. However, he was blocked off by several thousand Jun of force. The pressure coming from it was so severe that even he was unable to persist against it.</p>

  <p>After floating in mid-air for a fair amount of time, he landed at a place seventy thousand miles away from the entrance.</p>

  <p>As he got up, he dusted himself off and began to look around. Right in front of his eyes was a tall mountain over a thousand feet high. Hiding in the cracks of this mountain were members and disciples of some large races.</p>

  <p>Since the Chaotic Source Spirits would usually hide in the rocks, there was a high probability of them residing in the mountain.</p>

  <p>The people who were in the mountain tried to break the rocks to look for them. Although the process was tedious and required a lot of strength, the hopes of obtaining something, in the end, kept them from giving up.</p>

  <p>When the hurricane began to rage, they would seek refuge in the cracks of the mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as the hurricane subsided, they would come out of the cracks and continue with the task.</p>

  <p>The several races that stayed there held no grudges against each other. Their shared lack of talents and power compared to others bound them together as a group. No one would meddle in the other person's work, and they got along well.</p>

  <p>But their fortunate situation only lasted for a short while. The raging hurricane had brought the Evil God right to their doorstep. When their eyes met the Evil God's, they dropped what they were doing and froze in shock.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when the hurricane stopped, Luo Zheng landed in a small col.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because of the constant visits of the hurricane, the mountains of the Chaotic Source World remained barren.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly made his way inside the small col.</p>

  <p>He sat down before he forcefully removed the soul seal from the space ring.</p>

  <p id="top_2">He came across a variety of stored items as he rummaged through it to look for the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>After ignoring all the useless stuff collected by Yasin, he soon found the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached for it, the hair on the surface of its body stood up in response. Luo Zheng's touch had activated its defense mechanism. To protect itself from him, it came at Luo Zheng ferociously like a rabid dog.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng flipped his hand and pinned it to the ground effortlessly.</p>

  <p>"Feisty little thing, aren't you?" he muttered to himself as he felt it struggle.</p>

  <p>"Aha..."</p>

  <p>Alas, the Chaotic Source Spirit gave up and let out a squeal of grievance while it splayed out on the ground. It looked at Luo Zheng with its olive-like eyes filled with pain to appeal to his sensitive side.</p>

  <p>Taking a little effect on its pitiful eyes, Luo Zheng loosened his grip over it to ease the pain. Suddenly, he realized something.</p>

  <p>He didn't know the method of absorbing the Chaotic Source Spirit!</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit existed with a distinctive life form. It was originally a creature on the Other Shore. The question remained whether the descendants of two creatures from the Other Shore were still recognized as the creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Maybe he had to devour the Chaotic Source Spirit to merge with it?</p>

  <p>Sensing Luo Zheng's dilemma, No. 9527 stepped in to guide him. Its voice echoed in Luo Zheng's mind as it spoke, "Although most refer to this creature as the Chaotic Source Spirit, it's actually just the carrier of the Chaotic Source Spirit. There's no need for you to take its life. You can keep it in your inner world. I'll teach you."</p>

  <p>The most violent method was to kill this tiny innocent creature. They had to dissect its corpse to get the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>Many people would go with this brutal method to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirit. However, there was also a gentler procedure to not harm it and acquire what they wanted.</p>

  <p>Without wasting a moment, Luo Zheng grabbed the creature and proceeded to put it in his inner world through the cinnabar field. Then he followed No. 9527's instructions and carefully extracted the Chaotic Source Spirit from it.</p>

  <p>Not long after, an amber crystal forced its way out of the tiny body.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Chaotic Source Spirit?" Luo Zheng asked as he studied the crystal.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 nodded as it replied, "Yes, it is."</p>

  <p>"If I keep this little creature in my inner world, will it produce another crystal after some time?" Luo Zheng inquired again.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not. Just forget about it."</p>

  <p>Once the Chaotic Source Spirit was extracted from the body of the creature, it went through some physical changes. Its brown hair turned grayish-white, but its black olive eyes remained bright. It seemed this method had not caused it any harm.</p>

  <p>There were a total of two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits in the Chaotic Source World. Once the Chaotic Source Spirit was extracted from the carrier, the carrier would become an ordinary creature. Like every living being, it would gradually age and then die. So it would never produce any new Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept the little creature in his inner world. After all, it was the right thing to do after he had extracted the Chaotic Source Spirit from it. He had to give it a safe place to live out the rest of its life.</p>

  <p>He took the crystal from his inner world and studied it from all sides before storing it safely into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Now it was not the right time to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. He had to double his search and look for more Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>As he stood in the small col, he remembered the habitual nature of these little creatures. Studying the landscape of the area, he realized it was probable that some Chaotic Source Spirits hid underneath the rocks.</p>

  <p>He had to hurry before the hurricane rose again. Quickly, Luo Zheng crushed over a thousand divine crystals and replenished the energy of the Strength God Totem. Keeping his eyes glued to the rocks at his feet, he activated the Other Shore Power once more. Then, he balled his hands into fists and gathered massive power before he smashed the rocks below his feet.</p>
