<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1952 Breaking The Blood Curse Array </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was common practice to send the best talents in the universes into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for cultivation. Maha of the Sacred race had been to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land before since it was an open place.</p>

  <p>But at the end of it all, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was Holy Jay's place. He would, by no means, let the warriors of the Murphy Universe enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to hunt the Godly Geniuses of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay and Murphy were both members of the Hall of Holy Beings who looked to be in harmony to the public. But they had quite a few conflicts in private.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race couldn't hunt the Godly Geniuses in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. So Murphy resorted to different means. He asked the True Gods of the Sacred race to place the Grand Space Spell around the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>When the Godly Geniuses returned to the Evolutionary Universe from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Grand Space Spell would be activated and the Godly Geniuses would be transferred to random places.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Zheng was transferred to the Seven Ultimate World instead of the transmission array of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure the Godly Geniuses are back?" Maha asked, his tone dripping seriousness.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses would randomly be sent to the supreme worlds in the Evolutionary Universe by the Grand Space Spell. This was a good chance for the Sacred race to eliminate them.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. But I will try to kill him,"</p>

  <p>Connie said. The wolf teeth birthmarks on her face became redder and redder in an indication of her increasing excitement. She quietly brewed the life vitality in her body as she stared at Luo Zheng from the other side of the blood pool.</p>

  <p>"Don't act rashly! I'll come over to you as soon as possible," Maha said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Maha, the young master of the Sacred race, was very arrogant, but he was also a smart man.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses were Holy Mike's last hope. He had spent a lot of resources on them. As a result, every one of the Godly Geniuses was a mighty warrior.</p>

  <p>They had been cultivated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for three years. Now that they had returned, their strength must have been multiplied greatly.</p>

  <p>Maha, who had cultivated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land before, knew all about this. He was afraid that Connie would be no match for the Godly Genius that she encountered.</p>

  <p>Connie, however, didn't take Maha's words seriously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was sliding towards the blood pool, the strength in his body constantly brewing.</p>

  <p>His goal was not only this blood pool. If everything went well, he would completely destroy all four blood pools in the Ultimate Immortal City as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't realize that a woman of the Sacred race was after him.</p>

  <p>A thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>A hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was getting closer and closer to the blood pool. The smell of blood seemed to solidify in the air, but he seemed to not care about it.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng moved slowly towards the edge of the blood pool, the invisible force lifted him up.</p>

  <p>He stepped on the edge of the blood pool with one foot, and his body suddenly shook and threw away the invisible force.</p>

  <p>The invisible force was released by a certain divine texture in the Blood Curse Array. When Luo Zheng had broken off from the invisible force, his power had countered it� a power that had exceeded the limit that the divine texture could bear. The divine texture immediately exploded.</p>

  <p>At the same time, ordinary people on the road felt relaxed, and the invisible force that had driven them to death had vanished.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been brewing for such a long time. Once he started to make his moves, he would not hesitate any more. He was like a lurking predator who suddenly found the chance and rushed towards the Blood Curse Array above the blood pool.</p>

  <p id="top_4">"Tsk! Tsk! You are a swift guy," Connie said. She had been observing Luo Zheng all this while.</p>

  <p>She kicked at the air like a dancing butterfly, black beads appearing around her. She moved out, blocking Zheng's way.</p>

  <p>"What are you planning to do, handsome?" Connie asked Luo Zheng, a seductive smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked that the woman had found him. But his surprise only lasted for a few seconds before he said coldly, "Fuck off!" Hardly had his voice faded than he threw a punch at her.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Don't be so rude!" Connie complained, pouting, as she used her palm to block his strike. She was not afraid of him.</p>

  <p>There were Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe, and there were Godly Geniuses in the Murphy Universe too.</p>

  <p>Connie was one of the Godly Geniuses of the Murphy Universe. She was already a world lord, and her next goal was to condense a Godly Tile and become a True God. The warriors of the Sacred race regarded themselves head and shoulders above others, which was why Connie didn't think highly of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the moment her palm connected with Zheng's, her expression shifted drastically.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected Zheng's palm strike to contain such terrible power that she couldn't resist it.</p>

  <p>The power that the strike contained could kill a normal world lord.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The huge force poured into Connie's arm, the black beads around her body beginning to burst one by one.</p>

  <p>Before she could react, four beads had exploded.</p>

  <p>The huge force from Zheng's strike had suppressed Connie and sent her smashing into the blood pool below, causing a huge blood splash.</p>

  <p>Connie, who was now in the blood pool, was scared out of her wits.</p>

  <p>The seven black beads around her were treasures given to her by a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race. They were called the Life Sacrificing Beads. Each bead could bear a fatal injury for her.</p>

  <p>Every time a black bead exploded, she died once.</p>

  <p>These Life Sacrificing Beads had been with her for many years, and they had never exploded before. After all, she was respected in the Sacred race, and there had been little chance for her to face a life and death crisis.</p>

  <p>Never in Connie's wildest dreams had she thought that a man would smash four of her Life Sacrificing Beads with just one strike. Just one of Zheng's palm strikes was able to kill her four times.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how terrified Connie was at the moment. It was not until then that she remembered that Maha had warned her about this before.</p>

  <p>Connie was frightened. She crushed a light purple divine texture in her hand and a sharp siren sounded in the Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>All the warriors of the Sacred race in the city were on high alert when they heard the siren, the highest level of alert.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes didn't stop at the woman. His only goal was the Blood Curse Array. He suddenly swung in the air and continued to rush towards the array.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng progressed, he heard a buzzing sound, and a light yellow transparent light curtain appeared before him, blocking his way.</p>

  <p>"An enchanted barrier?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been looking at the Blood Curse Array for a long time. It was obvious that there would be an enchanted barrier in the Blood Curse Array. Following his own momentum, Luo Zheng threw a punch at the barrier.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, the enchanted barrier shook twice, but didn't break.</p>

  <p>Connie slowly floated up from the blood pool. She sneered as she saw Zheng's move.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng had infinite power, it was impossible to break the enchanted barrier with brute force. The enchanted barrier was created to deal with warriors with brute force.</p>

  <p>Four identical enchanted barriers were arranged above the four blood pools in the Ultimate Immortal City. The four enchanted barriers were interconnected with each other and they would collectively bear the attacks that any one of them received. If one wanted to destroy one of them, they would destroy all four of them simultaneously.</p>

  <p>A world lord just couldn't do so.</p>

  <p>Connie was optimistic in nature and didn't fear Luo Zheng killing her. She took out the communication token and said with a smile, "Maha, when can you come here? This guy has already started attacking the Blood Curse Array, but he plans to break the enchanted barrier with brute force. It's just� "</p>

  <p>Connie broke off, her eyes widening in shock.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had raised his hand and begun to twist space with his fist as the center.</p>

  <p>It was a piece of cake for a world lord to distort space with the Space Law.</p>

  <p>But she did not feel any Space Law in Luo Zheng, which meant that he hadn't used the Space Law to distort space.</p>

  <p>He had just used his pure strength. This force was so powerful that it created the gravitational force that distorted space.</p>

  <p>The blood in the blood pool, under the gravitational force, also moved and twisted.</p>

  <p>To everyone watching, the center of the blood pool sank down, as if there was an invisible ball pressing into the blood pool. Zheng's fist was at the center of this ball!</p>

  <p>"This guy's strength is unbelievable!" Connie's eyes widened even further and a bad premonition overcame her.</p>
