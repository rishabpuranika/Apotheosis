  <p>
</p>

  <p>Campbell's words made Zheng's eyes widen in surprise.</p>

  <p>Based on his tone, it didn't seem as if Campbell knew much about the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought it best to raise another question. "Master Campbell, what do you plan to do now?"</p>

  <p>Campbell raised his head to look at the starry sky. "Now that I'm awake, I will naturally go back and look for answers on who poisoned us back then."</p>

  <p>The builders had a relatively high position in the Four Spirits Sect and enjoyed a certain level of prestige.</p>

  <p>They were, after all, the ones whom the Four Spirits Sect relied on to expand their territory.</p>

  <p>To poison such important members of the Four Spirits Sect was a serious crime. It was no doubt done by someone with both guts and power. There was a solemn look in Campbell's eyes as he continued to stare at the sky. "I would like to know why they stopped us from awakening again, and again, and again..."</p>

  <p>As his words trailed off, he turned to look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He expected a look of enlightenment, an expression bright with realization, but all Campbell saw was Zheng's furrowed brows of worry.</p>

  <p>The young man's expression made him frown. "What's wrong?" Campbell asked. "Did I say anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>Zheng licked his lips as he let out a heavy sigh. "Did you never come into contact with anyone from the main world after you were poisoned?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Campbell shook his head. "No. Neither me nor any of my companions have ever met with anyone from the main world." Every single time he came here led by his obsession, he would end up killed by those big-headed monsters which prevented him from waking up completely.</p>

  <p>"So you are unaware of the Four Spirit Sect's current situation," Zheng murmured, his eyes twinkling with a strange color.</p>

  <p>"Why? What is their current situation?" Campbell asked, half puzzled yet also half-apprehensive with the look on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"If the creatures in our chaos want to enter the Three Purities Stage, we would need to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and become Eternal Realm warriors to do so," Zheng began.</p>

  <p>"I built the passage. I know how it works," Campbell replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>"I entered the center of the Eternal Scroll Painting."</p>

  <p>Campbell's brows rose at Zheng's revelation. "Then that means you're quite talented and you inherited the origin-level bloodline. Congratulations. No wonder your physical strength is excellent."</p>

  <p>To be able to obtain the origin-level bloodline was a very outstanding feat for creatures from secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>Of course, as a member and a builder of the Four Spirits Sect, the origin-level bloodline wasn't as big of a deal to Campbell. After all, those talented warriors of the Four Spirits Sect all set their minds to get the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was quick to correct him. "No, I entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard."</p>

  <p>This new piece of information made Campbell narrow his eyes at him.</p>

  <p>Creatures from secondary worlds weren't expected to reach the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Such a feat was incredibly rare.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, that immediately qualified him or her as a member of the Four Spirits Sect. Warriors who managed such a feat were usually outstanding and quickly grew powerful under the sect's guidance.</p>

  <p>Normally, the Ten Directions House of the Human Spirit Sect would reach out and immediately try to recruit such amazing talents. Why was Zheng here in the Three Purities Stage then?</p>

  <p>Did he fail in the Eternal Divine Courtyard? That couldn't be right.</p>

  <p>No, it was downright impossible!</p>

  <p>Only promising geniuses could ever set foot in the Eternal Divine Courtyard. The Four Spirits Sect made the test extremely difficult and strict on warriors from secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>The same couldn't be said for the members of the sect. They could enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard more easily but that also meant that quite a lot of them suffered the unbearable power of the ancestry-level bloodline, and thus were rejected by the bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, those from secondary worlds who had already entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard held a greater potential to pass the ancestry-level bloodline's test.</p>

  <p>"Did you enter by invitation?" Campbell asked.</p>

  <p>"Invitation?" Zheng repeated. He shook his head. "I got in by myself."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Campbell remarked in shock. Did he hear that correctly? "How in the world were you able to get in by yourself? Are you kidding me?!"</p>

  <p>The Eternal Divine Courtyard was the center of the Four Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>There was no way Zheng would've been allowed to enter by himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng's next few words would continue to shock Campbell. "There was nobody there. The Eternal Divine Courtyard was abandoned, at least that was what the bronze statues told me."</p>

  <p>Campbell could only shake his head, unwilling to accept Zheng's words as fact. He kept silent for a while.</p>

  <p>Then he said in a firm tone, "You're lying! There's no way the Four Spirits Sect would give up on the Eternal Divine Courtyard!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you," Zheng told him in what he hoped was a calming tone. "The Four Spirits Sect would have definitely been unwilling to give the courtyard up but maybe something happened to them? Like a catastrophe, maybe even a massacre?"</p>

  <p>Campbell froze. "Massacre..." he repeated. Zheng was about to ask him if he was okay when he suddenly let out a loud, maniacal laugh as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.</p>

  <p>A massacre? The Four Spirits Sect was the sole dominant power in the main world!</p>

  <p>Sure, there were a few creatures and races that were quite powerful but they were nothing compared to the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>After his less than sane laughter, Campbell threw Zheng an aggressive glare.</p>

  <p>"Who can massacre our Four Spirits Sect?"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to use his calm voice to talk to an obviously distressed Campbell. "Yes, the Four Spirits Sect was indeed powerful," he began.</p>

  <p>"However, the human, snake, bird, and monkey spirits weren't usually united, correct? Wouldn't there be any internal strife which led them to kill each other?</p>

  <p>You said it yourself: the Four Spirits Sect was so powerful that no one would ever dare attack you. Nobody, of course, save for the people within the sect itself," Zheng declared.</p>

  <p>"I met the brush wielder. He told me that there was some sort of internal strife within the Four Spirits Sect which led to a split-up."</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words were sent and translated through the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in his inner world. They eventually reached the ears of the group of people who then conveyed them through a song.</p>

  <p>His words managed to convince Campbell.</p>

  <p>After all, it was the most viable reason.</p>

  <p>Who would ever dare attack the powerful world builders? Who would ever dare poison them?</p>

  <p>There was no way some external force would be stupid enough to do such a thing. So that meant the culprit was someone from the inside. An outsider would never succeed in poisoning two hundred world builders unnoticed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the black-robed men couldn't understand since Zheng's voice was directly transmitted to his inner world. It was better this way since there was some information that couldn't be revealed to everyone.</p>

  <p>All they knew was that there was a bit of singing and then Campbell suddenly became very upset so they naturally wanted to know what happened.</p>

  <p>"No!" Campbell declared. "I do not believe this. I will go there myself!"</p>

  <p>Denial was always the first stage in grief. No matter how rational Zheng's words had been, Campbell did not want to believe them.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't believe unless he confirmed it with his own two eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>He immediately stamped his feet on one side of the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>From there, a series of patterns flashed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, a strangely-shaped collection of houses suddenly floated into the air.</p>

  <p>The house on the helm was incredibly small and only featured a door that could accommodate a single person at most. There were a total of five houses and each house was twice the size of the one that preceded it.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell," Zheng called out to Campbell. "Where are you going?!"</p>

  <p>"As a builder, I naturally have a path that could take me to the main world.</p>

  <p>There is no need to follow me. Creatures from secondary worlds would have difficulty traveling in the main world without undergoing transformation," Campbell answered just as he pushed the door open.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Boom!"</p>

  <p>He had just taken a step inside the threshold when a great force shook the door.</p>

  <p>Campbell tried to grab the door frame out of instinct but it only ended up with him thrown into the air and landing over ten miles away, with both his hands and feet also stretching for the same distance.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Campbell was in the form of a Treacherous Being and was able to withstand the blow.</p>
