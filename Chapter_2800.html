<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng, Sword Chen, and the woman were watching everything from above.</p>

  <p>When the woman saw Nicholas flying to her, her eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>Of course she knew why Nicholas was doing this. He wanted to lure the Cold Fiends here.</p>

  <p>"Let's leave," the woman said as she glanced at Zheng. "Be careful."</p>

  <p>Her original plan had been to force the Holy Beings to break through the Cold Fiends' lair. By then, most of the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings would have died. After that, she would have been able to lead the Holy Beings' clones to reap the spoils.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Nicholas was making a move against her first.</p>

  <p>Even with her strength, she wouldn't be able to escape if the Cold Fiends blocked her way out of the groove.</p>

  <p>So, she had to get out as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The only thought on her mind was escaping this place with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>She tapped the ground with her toes and shot forward.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' clones followed suit.</p>

  <p>"How dare you lure the Cold Fiends here!" the woman said coldly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas merely sneered in response and hovered in the air. The many Cold Fiends behind him spat out cold air from their mouths, aiming at the woman.</p>

  <p>Every Holy Being was a unique existence and a prestigious citizen of the divine land, but even among them, Nicholas was ranked first. How could he be controlled by the woman?</p>

  <p>Before, he had only gone down step by step because he had been forced to do so. Along the way, he had had to bear the urge to fight back.</p>

  <p>But now that he had found a chance to strike back, there was no way he would let it go.</p>

  <p>The dense cold air turned into a large disordered net and enveloped the woman. There was almost no space to escape in the large net.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had done a good job.</p>

  <p>"Master, be careful!"</p>

  <p>"Sacred Twilight Flame!"</p>

  <p>"Wood Divine Thunder!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' clones were standing in a lower spot near Nicholas, so they were not affected by the cold air.</p>

  <p>But when they saw that their master was in danger, they rushed to fight.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>These clones were actually as intelligent as real beings and knew how potent the cold air was.</p>

  <p>They gathered energy with their internal momentum to help the woman dispel the cold air.</p>

  <p>However, the characteristics of the cold air were too complicated. Even the most powerful force would be reduced to almost nothing in front of it.</p>

  <p>The moment all their forces came into contact with the cold air, they froze.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The woman took this chance to retreat.</p>

  <p>A ball of brown light quickly formed within her body as she drew out the force of primitive fear in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>Soon, the light transformed into a brown shield that stood in front of her.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish...</p>

  <p>The surface of the shield froze because of the cold air around it.</p>

  <p>The fact was, the force of primitive fear was a very powerful energy. Even Nicholas could be trapped by it.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen, a Demi-holy Being, could also greatly enhance his strength by combining the Gods-intimidating Strike with the force of primitive fear, allowing him to fight even against Samuel.</p>

  <p>However, the force of primitive fear wouldn't be able to withstand the cold air at all.</p>

  <p>After the brown shield froze, a crack appeared on its surface and began to spread out. With a loud clang, the shield broke into pieces which scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings below had to constantly dodge the fragments of the shield, because the cold air contained within the pieces was also fatal.</p>

  <p>As soon as the shield broke, the woman lightly touched the air in front of her, and another shield appeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>As shields constantly continued to appear and break, the woman seized the opportunity to retreat.</p>

  <p>After using the Cold Fiends to fight the woman, Nicholas didn't stop. He circled along the wall of the cave, quickly approaching Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We were destined to meet again!"</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas was also in danger, he wore a faint smile when he faced Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had no chance of escaping.</p>

  <p>Back in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, it had been very unwise on his part to let Zheng and Joy slip through his hands.</p>

  <p>However, it hadn't been something that he could anticipate. After all, he had not expected Estelle to take action at such a critical moment.</p>

  <p>Either way, he had never imagined that Zheng would come back with a group of powerhouses.</p>

  <p>Now that Nicholas had finally gotten a chance, he would not show Zheng any mercy.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>A black and white handprint condensed on Nicholas's palm.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Dark and Light Chaos was more than enough to kill Zheng, a mere consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Killing Zheng was the most important thing right now; Nicholas could think of a way to deal with the woman after that.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to hit Zheng's right side, Zheng twisted his body in the air and dodged his palm skillfully.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked a little stunned. Obviously, he hadn't expected this.</p>

  <p>What was going on?</p>

  <p>He didn't think that Zheng had the ability to predict things, and yet, Zheng seemed to have known what was in his mind and avoided his palm in advance.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was just a coincidence.</p>

  <p>His brain churned. Without stopping, he made another strike with his palm.</p>

  <p>His second palm attack was erratic, so he thought that Zheng definitely wouldn't be able to predict this attack.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng twisted his body again. With the same uncanny bodily movement skill, he easily avoided Nicholas's palm once more.</p>

  <p>A trace of confusion finally appeared on Nicholas's face.</p>

  <p>'Something's wrong. He seems to be able to read my mind.'</p>

  <p>Such a strange thought suddenly popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>But how could his soul be read by a consummate True God? How was Zheng doing it?</p>

  <p>Nicholas had his suspicions, but he didn't voice them out to Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng himself volunteered the information. "If you want to know how I'm doing it, you can go ask Samuel!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Why should I ask him?" Nicholas's face darkened.</p>

  <p>At the mention of Samuel's name, something occurred to him.</p>

  <p>When they had been fighting against the little fiends in the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region, they had been unable to use their spiritual senses because of the Soul Devouring Bugs.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one had been able to see the movements of the little fiends— with the exception of two people: Nicholas and Samuel.</p>

  <p>With the Eye of Perception, Nicholas could foretell the next few seconds of every moment, so he had known how those little fiends would attack them.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel, who didn't have the Eye of Perception, had also seemed to be able to foretell everything.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had had a strange feeling about it for quite some time. How had Samuel been able to see those little fiends?</p>

  <p>Could it be that he could read Nicholas's mind?</p>

  <p>If that was the case, he would be able to make decisions in advance by taking advantage of Nicholas's thoughts.</p>
