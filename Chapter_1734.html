<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone on the platform looked down on Zheng.</p>

  <p>The auction of the nine-star sword tokens was already a matter approved by the Sword Manor. Even life vitality jades obtained from the auction would be handed over to the manor according to a certain percentage.</p>

  <p>These were the set rules of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Any trouble Zheng seemed to be stirring would be met with his quick extermination.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors guessed that he was probably an independent warrior without a backer. This made it easier for them since nobody would question the death of an insignificant independent warrior.</p>

  <p>Freya was currently feeling extremely guilty. She had once again brought trouble to Zheng, but she didn't really have a choice. Even if she didn't bring him to the market tonight, he wouldn't be able to get a nine-star sword token from the Breeze Sword School tomorrow either.</p>

  <p>A shiver went down her spine when she noticed the strange gazes of the warriors. However, she didn't say anything. She merely stood to the side and waited for Zheng to make his move.</p>

  <p>"Will you give your servant girl to me?" the warrior on the platform asked. He knew Zheng would not be willing to do as he asked, and he was really just making fun of him. He knew that the young man wouldn't dare make a move in here.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was someone capable and powerful, then why would he need a nine-star sword token to enter the Sword Manor? That place was very welcoming with geniuses who came from major powers. There would've been no need for tokens!</p>

  <p>Anyone who had to compete for the nine-star sword token was most likely an independent warrior.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sneered as he gave that warrior a piercing glare.</p>

  <p>He didn't really want to cause any trouble either. All he really wanted to do was follow the path set by Supreme Lord Sword in order to advance his swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, that wasn't possible.</p>

  <p>It seemed he would have to represent Supreme Lord Sword to teach these guys a lesson.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to make his move, a thick, malicious aura burst forth from his body.</p>

  <p>Fighting was strictly prohibited in the market, and not many people were willing to break the rules. This was why nobody really panicked when a slender figure shot out of Zheng's body and zoomed towards the platform.</p>

  <p>The warriors were initially relaxed. However, their moods took a turn when the arrival of this figure plunged their hearts down to their stomachs. The air around them felt stifling as if they had drawn the ire of someone they should never have messed with.</p>

  <p>The slender figure that zoomed towards them was none other than Xun.</p>

  <p>Her reaction was somewhat strange.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had returned from the Illusion Battlefield, he had noticed her being more quiet than usual. She was very happy to see the Saint Killing Spear, but she didn't really say anything after that.</p>

  <p>Xun never really talked much in the past, but this time felt different.</p>

  <p>It was as if she simply didn't have the energy to talk at all.</p>

  <p>So seeing her so pumped up right now was surprising, but it also meant that things were about to get complicated real soon.</p>

  <p>These people had been rude to him, so Zheng naturally wouldn't let them off. He had planned to teach them a lesson, but never planned on killing them.</p>

  <p>Xun's appearance changed things. He just knew she wasn't going to let these warriors leave this place alive.</p>

  <p>The three warriors all thought Zheng wouldn't dare make a move. None of them expected the sudden appearance of this strange, scary figure.</p>

  <p>All three of them had a bad premonition with regards to this terrifying figure. All of a sudden, three swords appeared beside each of them.</p>

  <p>Most of Xun's soul had already been restored. Zheng's sword spirit had also helped in substantially increasing her strength. The only thing she lacked now was a body. These Spirit Supreme Realm warriors did not stand a chance at all.</p>

  <p>One of them pulled out a sword and held it against Xun. Her hand briefly brushed past the blade and, for some reason, it jumped into her hand.</p>

  <p>The moment it went to her hand, the sword swung down and cut its former wielder's throat.</p>

  <p>The warrior wanted to dodge but Xun's eyes and the massive soul pressure had rendered him immobile.</p>

  <p>As the sword slashed his throat, another figure flew past them.</p>

  <p>Puff! There was a loud sound as the figure launched his attack.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng! With a powerful punch, he sent the Spirit Supreme Realm warrior flying.</p>

  <p>However, Xun wasn't yet finished. She grabbed the sword and turned it towards her. Without any hesitation, she stabbed it through her own armpit and towards another Spirit Supreme Realm warrior behind her.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Zheng went in for another punch. The person was also sent flying and most probably only had half his life left.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Xun yelled at him angrily. She then shifted her gaze to the last Spirit Supreme Realm warrior standing.</p>

  <p>Before she could do anything, Zheng had already gone ahead and punched him.</p>

  <p>"These people were rude, but we can just teach them a lesson. No need to kill them," he told her.</p>

  <p>Xun stared at him blankly. Instead of replying, she simply threw down the sword before turning into specks of red light and flying straight into his body.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on Zheng's face. He was extremely confused with Xun's thoughts and actions.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the nine-star sword tokens." Freya reminded him. She held up two tokens in her hands, having obtained them during the chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not even try to justify this method of obtaining the tokens. Since these people did not allow him to obtain one cleanly through the swordsmanship competition, then he could only resort to such underhanded means.</p>

  <p>The warriors beneath the platform were hunched over in hush discussion.</p>

  <p>There was no denying that Zheng's actions shocked them completely.</p>

  <p>None of them clearly saw what happened after Xun appeared. They heard a couple of loud sounds and then the figure suddenly burst into tiny specks of red light that were absorbed into Zheng's body. It was only after this that they realized that it was probably Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>"That sword spirit's soul force is so powerful."</p>

  <p>"Her malicious aura was so intense, right?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know where this guy came from, but I think he's going to suffer the consequences of causing such a ruckus here."</p>

  <p>These people should've known who Zheng was. In fact, everyone in the universe should know his name. It was rare to see a human martial artist using a Demon Night woman for a sword spirit, after all.</p>

  <p>However, the universe was simply boundless and it was impossible for these people to think that Zheng, the champion of the Illusion Battlefield, would actually appear in front of them. What was more unbelievable was the fact that he was ready to fight others for the sake of nine-star sword tokens.</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor had an Illusion Space, but only core members were qualified to view the Illusion Battlefield through it. The warriors in the market were all disciples of various sword schools and none had gotten the opportunity to see Zheng's face on the painting scroll.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the two tokens from Freya. Just as he was about to put them away, three people on flying swords came over from the sky.</p>

  <p>Flying was prohibited in the cities within the Sword Manor's vicinity.</p>

  <p>Warriors would normally not exceed a height of one hundred feet since the air restriction barrier would be triggered.</p>

  <p>However, these three were evidently not affected by the restriction. The one on the lead looked really angry. "Who dares to cause trouble here?"</p>

  <p>"He is a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior," Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>Had it been before, Zheng would've already hightailed it out of there.</p>

  <p>However, he now more or less had the strength to fight against a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The thing was, there were three Spirit Transformation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>This market was originally under the jurisdiction of the Breeze Sword School four or five miles away. This distance was nothing to a warrior.</p>

  <p>Nobody would dare cause trouble here under normal circumstances.</p>

  <p>One of the people who rushed over was the leader of the Breeze Sword School while the other two were higher-ups of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Keane, the leader, was a short-tempered man and quickly turned black in anger when he saw three of his men unconscious. He quickly unsheathed his sword and slashed out a sharp cyan sword light towards Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation on his part. He aimed at Zheng for the kill.</p>

  <p>The people in the market all cried out and fled in different directions.</p>

  <p>Getting caught in the middle of this fight would only lead to their early death.</p>

  <p>Keane's temper was notorious. Watching this fight would be interesting but putting their lives on the line wasn't really worth it.</p>

  <p>Those further away couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>"That man is still so young. It's a pity he's going to lose his life like this."</p>

  <p>"Meh! Does he really think he could stroll around here causing trouble left and right without paying a price? He is arrogant and he deserves to die!"</p>

  <p>To the independent warriors present, causing a ruckus in the Sword Manor was equivalent to suicide.</p>
