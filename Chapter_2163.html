<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2163 The Money Alley </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was highly irritated. Over the past few days, there were always people who sneakily followed him no matter where he went.</p>

  <p>Although those people hid well, Luo Zheng could still detect their presence.</p>

  <p>Then again, he didn't need to bother with them as it was very safe in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>He shifted his focus back to his priority, which was to get some essential items such as the space ring that could store things.</p>

  <p>He had been using the sword sheath as a substitute for a while now, but he found that it wasn't very convenient at all. Now that Luo Zheng had earned five thousand divine might coins in one go, he could buy anything he wanted.</p>

  <p>After a few moments under the guidance of Master Evil, Luo Zheng had crossed more than half of the Six-Burden Divine City and had now arrived at a small alley.</p>

  <p>"Money Alley? You mean here?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His face twisted into an unreadable expression as he stood in front of the alley.</p>

  <p>The pathway was very narrow and could allow only one person to pass through and from the outside, it looked rather plain and even shabby.</p>

  <p>"Hehe, of course this is the place. The Money Alley is very famous in the Six-Burden Divine City. As long as you have the divine might coins, you can buy any strange things that you could imagine," Master Evil said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But why people like to come to this narrow alley?" Clearly, the alley's appearance confused Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng heard a loud, rough voice behind him that sounded like rocks that were rubbed against each other.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly dodged to the side and turned around, only to see a group of about seven people who walked towards the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>The owner of the voice was a fat guy at the forefront of the group. His body's girth was equivalent to his height, which made him look like a ball.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw him, his eyes flashed in realization. "A mid-rank True God!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen quite a lot of True Gods after he came out of the Evolutionary Universe, but the majority of them were only low-rank True Gods. The only mid-rank True Gods he knew were Master Evil, Wayne, Yorick, and a few others.</p>

  <p>There was a time when he had asked Master Evil why there were only a few mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>And since Master Evil had always answered Zheng's questions, he naturally indulged him.</p>

  <p>The divine land was an extremely stable world, completely different from the environments in any universe.</p>

  <p>Incidents rarely happened in such a world, and there were rarely any talents or unique beings who could change the world. It was safe to say that the vast majority of the divine citizens did not have very long-term aspirations. Even if they did become True Gods, it would be very hard for them to become mainstream powerful masters, and it was even less possible for them to achieve the consummation of True Gods; and even more unlikely for them to become Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In other words, the paths for lower level martial artists to advance to achieve higher levels were completely blocked.</p>

  <p>"The martial artists in the Evolutionary Universe are like water. Of course, strong martial artists would fall from their positions if they don't work hard. Even if they don't fall, they will die from the depletion of their lifespan, and eventually lose their positions to others. Supreme Lords are no exception. Thus, the weaker ones work hard to achieve higher status.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the True Gods in the divine land are like mountains-- they cannot flow, but their lifespans are infinite. The strong ones are always strong. When they have occupied all the seats of power, the lower level martial artists would have no more chances to move up. No matter how hard the divine citizens work, it would simply be futile.</p>

  <p>This is the so-called social immobility!" Master Evil explained.</p>

  <p>A sigh escaped Zheng's lips when Master Evil had finished.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Master Evil had a thorough view towards the matters of the world and had come to such a conclusion about the divine land.</p>

  <p>Then again, it did explain why there were so few mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>It was also no wonder that Yorick was willing to lurk in the Misty Mountain Village for seven divine eras and wait for Master Evil's return, all for a Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>After all, the Stone Mouse symbolized hope. Neither Yorick nor Master Evil aspired to become Holy Beings; they even didn't hold any hopes of reaching the consummation of True Gods. All they wanted to do was to improve further by breaking through in the level of mid-rank True Gods and become top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>These two True Gods had risked their lives in hopes of advancing a little further, and it was clear how difficult it was for warriors in the divine land to break through.</p>

  <p>The round-bodied warrior glanced briefly at Luo Zheng before he squeezed into the narrow passageway of the Money Alley. His body was much wider than the skinny path, but he forced his way in with all his might.</p>

  <p>Once he had successfully got in, he disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>The few people behind him followed suit as well and disappeared from Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>"So there's another world in this Money Alley!" Luo Zheng exclaimed at this revelation and he, too, stepped into the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>The moment he set foot into the narrow passage, ripples of water flashed in front of his eyes. It looked like the space itself had been distorted. The area in front of him suddenly became spacious, as if he had arrived in another world. He was now face to face with a broad street.</p>

  <p>On both sides of the street were rows of stalls that were lined in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods slowly trickled through the street, which made the place look like a market in the mortal world.</p>

  <p>"Wow, there are so many True Gods�" Luo Zheng said in a daze. He hadn't seen so many True Gods in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Most of warriors in the city were proving godly warriors, which did not seem to match the place's name which was "divine city". Now, he had never expected that so many True Gods actually gathered in the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng stepped forward, one of the city guards rushed towards him and asked, "Do you have anything to sell?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head in response and said, "I'm here to buy something."</p>

  <p>The guard nodded in understanding and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the guard's chipper attitude bewildered him. "Why are the guards of the Six-Burden Divine City so enthusiastic?" Luo Zheng asked Master Evil curiously.</p>

  <p>Master Evil chuckled then said, "Yes. There are actually several entrances to this Money Alley. Most True Gods who have returned to the Six-Burden Divine City come here to sell what they have obtained from other places. On the other hand, the shops outside the divine cities are mainly targeted towards the warriors and divine citizens below the level of True Gods. If a True God wants to set up a stall in the Money Alley, they will have to pay a fee and an additional which is a certain percentage of the fee. The latter is actually tax payment, so the guards would naturally be very enthusiastic."</p>

  <p>"Even True Gods have to pay taxes�" Luo Zheng muttered with wide eyes. It was unbelievable. It reminded him of a book he had once read in the Eastern Region. There was a passage in the book that said death and tax revenues could not be avoided. Even the True Gods who had escaped death and obtained eternal life still had to pay taxes.</p>

  <p>His legs continued to take him forward as he let his thoughts wander.</p>

  <p>Most of the people on the street were low-rank True Gods, and there were a very small number of mid-rank True Gods. There wasn't a lot of proving godly warriors, and even if there were some, they were accompanied by True Gods. They were clearly disciples from some large clans.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked down some more, he saw that the shops on both sides of the street were filled with plenty of goods. They sold so many different types of items that he couldn't even name most of them.</p>

  <p>A great number of the stalls were owned by True Gods. Some of them were very enthusiastic towards their customers, while others were quite silent. Those quiet ones simply placed the items they sold on the stall and sat on the side, their eyes closed in contemplation.</p>

  <p>"This Heavenly Spirit Root was unearthed three divine eras ago. It's only for twenty divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a certain seller's voice caught Zheng's ears. Luo Zheng immediately turned and saw a section of shiny wood in the stall on the left. The piece of wood was crisscrossed like a catapult and its surface glowed jade green. It was indeed, quite eye-catching.</p>

  <p>"Hey, man. Are you interested?"</p>

  <p>The stall owner was also a low-rank True God and didn't seem to mind Zheng's identity as a proving godly warrior, as seen in his friendly disposition towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He went closer to the stall and examined the shiny piece of glowing wood. "What is this?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard of the Heavenly Spirit Root? It is something that can increase one's talent. It can be swallowed directly, or it can be refined into a Heavenly Spirit Pill. After one takes it, their mind would become clear and their comprehension will soar," the True God said as he smiled, his eyes both shaped like upturned crescents.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng remained silent as Master Evil quickly said in his mind,</p>

  <p>"It's fake! Not even two hundred divine might coins would get you a genuine Heaven Spirit Root, much less twenty!"</p>

  <p>Once Master Evil had finished, Luo Zheng turned around and left without a word.</p>

  <p>"Hey, man! Don't go�" the True God helplessly shouted a few more times. He could only sigh. It was truly harder and harder to deceive younger people these days, he thought.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng continued his stroll as his eyes wandered about. Just then, a ray of light burst out from somewhere, and he quickly followed where it was.</p>

  <p>It led him to a shop with several brocade boxes. The brocade box on the outermost was already opened, and inside it was a golden Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>There were small densely-packed characters around the Sanskrit word, which turned out to be notes that explained the Sanskrit word.</p>
