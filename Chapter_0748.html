<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 748 The Amazing Enchanted Barriers </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Heavy footsteps thundered on the dusty rock surface. It was Luo Luo Zheng, who slowly descended into the arena and walked towards Marilyn.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the power of Luo Zheng's punch was enough to break all of Marilyn's bones, but she wasn't dead yet.</p>

  <p>If Marilyn were only an ordinary woman, it would be impossible to save her life as her injuries were too grave? but she was a cultivator at the Internal Elixir Realm. As long as she was treated with elixirs in time, she would eventually heal.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was about to kill this woman.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng won! He really won. Luckily I bet on him!"</p>

  <p>"But it seems he wants to kill Marilyn! Will he dare do that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Eddie is watching them!"</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors in the audience began to whisper among themselves when they saw Luo Luo Zheng walking towards Marilyn. If he really dared to kill her, then things would get worse.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie tightly clutched the crystal in her small hand. It was already infused with her life vitality, and the magical eye of the Angel of Death constantly rotated inside. She was nervous at that moment, as she was quite clear that Luo Luo Zheng would kill Marilyn.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, leave the arena and I'll spare your life. One more step and you'll die!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's calm voice rang from the elevated platform. He walked towards the platform's edge with closed fists, which glowed with yellow life vitality.</p>

  <p>The elevated platform built by the World Commercial Alliance was made of solid basalt. A crack appeared on its surface beneath Eddie's feet, and then it passed through a few feet on the elevated platform before it spread to his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Eddie had shattered the platform with just a light step. Everyone went completely silent, and only the cracking sound of the basalt was heard.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the large sects were also speechless. Even the naive and talkative Brent sensed the tense atmosphere before him and didn't say a word.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng stopped and looked at Eddie. Marilyn was very important to Eddie, but Luo Luo Zheng had to kill her for Yan's sake.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Luo Zheng crossed the space again. The long sword in his hand glinted under the light as he aimed it straight at Marilyn's neck.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!" Eddie shouted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he threw a frustrated punch towards the arena.</p>

  <p>Though he hadn't attacked anyone for many years, he was still the number one warrior in the Central Region. One could just imagine the power of his punch.</p>

  <p>His punch seemed to drain the world of all its energy as his bright, golden fist shot towards Luo Luo Zheng at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>As he launched his attack, Eddie was confident that he could kill Luo Luo Zheng before Luo Luo Zheng could kill Marilyn.</p>

  <p>The moment Eddie made his move, everyone gasped and held their breaths.</p>

  <p>The number one warrior in the Central Region launched his attack, which was targeted at a junior at the Illuminating Soul Realm. He really did attack Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>In the crowd, Ning Yudie gently clenched her fist, and the crystal in her hand instantly shattered. A dark, golden light flashed from the magical eye of the Angel of Death, which had broken free from the crystal.</p>

  <p>The ray of light looked like it could destroy everything it touched. It shot towards Eddie's fist radiance at an extremely fast speed, and completely destroyed it.</p>

  <p>"It?it?it is done! Evil East Lord's punch is blocked!"</p>

  <p>"It's the leader of the Cloud Hall! I thought she was too young to be a powerful cultivator."</p>

  <p>"She used a treasure. It's one of Cloud Hall's trump cards, the magical eye of the Angel of Death if I'm not mistaken? Rumor has it that it is the most precious treasure that could kill a cultivator at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in an instant!"</p>

  <p>Now, all the spectating cultivators were so shocked by the turn of events that they almost couldn't breathe. They couldn't predict what would happen next, and could only sit and watch from their seats.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eddie just snorted. He didn't stop and threw out another punch.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng's sword was already at Marilyn's neck, while Eddie's fist radiance was aimed at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yudie's expression changed. Just as she was about to rush into the arena, she saw that Luo Luo Zheng didn't push down his sword. Instead, he raised his head and smiled at Eddie.</p>

  <p>Just when everyone thought that Luo Luo Zheng would die, he even managed a strange smile. Everyone couldn't help but feel something was off.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The punch violently burst out with extreme power. The most affected ones were the cultivators outside the arena.</p>

  <p>The power of Eddie's punch was enough to stop the river's flow and caused the mountains to collapse. The violent winds from the punch blew down everyone in the audience, and they all fell on top of each other.</p>

  <p>Tianming and his friends were seated at the very last row. They fared slightly better, but they were still affected and were moved away from their seats.</p>

  <p>They were filled with shock, followed by endless worry.</p>

  <p>When the power of Eddie's punch had revealed itself, everyone looked towards the arena once again. To their surprise, Luo Luo Zheng still stood there, unharmed!</p>

  <p>"What happened? Luo Luo Zheng blocked Eddie's punch?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! This kind of thing would never happen, even in a dream.</p>

  <p>How's that possible that he blocked Eddie's fist?"</p>

  <p>"Eddie is a warrior at the Life and Death Realm. He's been through three Heavenly Tribulations, and is now comparable to an immortal. Luo Luo Zheng is just a nobody. That doesn't make sense!"</p>

  <p>When everyone thought that Luo Luo Zheng had vanished into thin air, he stood there in the arena completely unscathed, and didn't even move an inch. This was too good to be true.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, Lady Poison-blood, Raven, Xander, Dillon, Hobbes, and Xiao all moved to the side, with shock in their wide eyes.</p>

  <p>The cultivators in the audience probably didn't see what happened, which was why they were surprised to see Luo Luo Zheng stand unharmed even after Eddie had punched him.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm clearly saw that Eddie's attack did not hit Luo Luo Zheng, but was blocked by the arena's enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>"The enchanted barriers can block a punch from a cultivator at the Life and Death Realm?" Xander exclaimed. Now, he was even more confused.</p>

  <p>Whether it was Ning Yudie, Xander, or Dillon, they all suddenly thought of the runes that Luo Luo Zheng had drawn on the stone tablets. He must have tampered with the runes when he repaired them.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barriers' defensive power formed by the runes under the arena was already impressive on their own.</p>

  <p>The initial goal when the enchanted barriers were designed was to block out the powers of the cultivators at the Internal Elixir Realm. The players in the Martial Arts Contest were usually only at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, but this time it was raised to the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. The defensive power of these six enchanted barriers was tailored to those at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if Luo Luo Zheng had redrawn some of the runes and used the Perfect Brushwork to activate the runes' maximum power, the enchanted barriers were only able to withstand an attack from a warrior at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm at most.</p>

  <p>However, Eddie, who had stepped into the Life and Death Realm and passed through three Heavenly Tribulations, couldn't break the enchanted barriers. It was simply unbelievable.</p>

  <p>It was on par to the sect-protecting array Arnold, the Son of Rune, had left behind.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the sect-protecting array had tens of thousands of runes in it. The combined power of all its runes was able to activate the defensive power of this level. How many runes were under the small arena? It was only a few hundred runes!</p>

  <p>In addition, Luo Luo Zheng had only re-drawn more than a hundred runes.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's existence immediately became like a precious treasure in the eyes of many sect leaders.</p>

  <p>The sect-protecting array was too important for any sect. If they encountered strong enemies, the sect-protecting array would always be able to hold them off for a period of time. It was unlikely for the invaders to smash the whole sect into pieces.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, the Black Mountain Sect, a fourth-grade sect, had a feud with a cultivator at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. That cultivator was no match for the leader of Black Mountain Sect, but he was extremely fast in speed.</p>

  <p>Whenever the leader of Black Mountain Sect went into seclusion or occasionally left the sect, that cultivator wrecked chaos in the Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>When the leader came back, the cultivator had already escaped.</p>

  <p>Even a cultivator at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm had caused a fourth-grade sect to suffer. In the end, the Black Mountain Sect had no choice but to settle this matter.</p>

  <p>It would have been helpful for them if they had a sect-protecting array at that time. It would at least hold off the enemy for quite a long while.</p>

  <p>Back to the present, Luo Luo Zheng had only used more than a hundred runes to block Eddie's attack. If he had drawn thousands of runes to form a sect-protecting array, would it have been enough to defend against a cultivator at the Life and Death Realm and even kill him?</p>

  <p>With that thought into consideration, one could imagine how astounded the sect leaders were. Even Lady Poison-blood, who hated Luo Luo Zheng so much, suddenly looked at Luo Luo Zheng seductively, her eyes filled with hunger and thirst.</p>
