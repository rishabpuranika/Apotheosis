<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a scornful smirk on Lone's face as he stood still, his indifferent gaze fixed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He thought that Luo Zheng was only able to face him now because he got lucky, and he was wielding the Saint Killing Spear of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>"The one who made that spear is quite brilliant. He integrated the advantages of the two divine woods in it, so this spear's power can be released to the maximum," the dark iron sword communicated to Lone. It continued, "But the four divine trees are ginormous. That spear only has two pieces of woods in it, so it doesn't have much spirituality. The weapons which are born in the current round of heavens are congenitally deficient. The divine trees' roots are outside the Sighing Wall and absorbing infinite chaotic energy there. Without the chaotic energy's nourishment, the divine woods will rot. Ha-ha! Go and kill him. Teach him a lesson about the huge difference between a loser and a winner!"</p>

  <p>Lone nodded with a smile. Not only was this sword his weapon, it was also his friend and teacher. It could be said that if it wasn't for his sword, he wouldn't have made such an achievement.</p>

  <p>"This Luo Zheng seems to have an issue with Lone before, right?"</p>

  <p>"I think Luo Zheng will lose this time. He doesn't seem proficient with the spear, even though he had used the Saint Killing Spear to fight his way here. Now, he's faced with the Godly Geniuses who have real power, so he'll have to show his true colors!"</p>

  <p>"Lone's sword is very special. It must be a supreme divine weapon, but it is not on the Spirit Tablet."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard? There are some extremely powerful weapons which have surpassed the limit of the Spirit Tablet in this round of our universe.</p>

  <p>They're not listed in the Spirit Tablet."</p>

  <p>Some of the spectators discussed among themselves. It was known that the Universe Spirit Tablet detected weapons that appeared in the universe.</p>

  <p>Of course, weapons beyond the universe wouldn't be detected.</p>

  <p>It was similar to Zheng's will of the great world, because Luo Zheng couldn't find related memories of the things beyond the great world.</p>

  <p>When Lone showed his power for the first time in the competition of the four clans, many people, even some Supreme Lords included had marked his sword.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Lone was an overmatch of his generation.</p>

  <p>However, there were too many masters in the universe. Some of them were able to take his sword away.</p>

  <p>Yet, all those masters gave up after they made contact with Lone. The reason was quite interesting.</p>

  <p>Now, most of them just wanted to watch their battle for fun.</p>

  <p>They were particularly excited about this battle because Luo Zheng was so famous and he'd offended many great forces, so some people naturally hoped that Lone would kill him and make him eliminated.</p>

  <p>Most people thought that both of them only relied on their weapons.</p>

  <p>Since the Saint Killing Spear could only release its full strength when Xun controlled it, Lone would undoubtedly have the upper hand this time.</p>

  <p>Thus, most people thought that Lone would win over Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they thought that it was already good enough for Luo Zheng if he ended up ranking tenth.</p>

  <p>There were too many dark horses in this round of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Mu Ning and Tianming would rank higher.</p>

  <p>Then again, most warriors didn't know the relationship between Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Mu Ning. They thought that the three of them had just known each other during the second stage.</p>

  <p>Preston from the Pure Jade Sacred Place was one of the few people who knew that the three of them came from the same force in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>"Will Luo Zheng win this battle?"</p>

  <p>The Godly Genius of the Humanity Alliance had been eliminated, so all their warriors could only pin their hopes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Preston was actually much more discerning than Ning Yudie, but he was also uncertain about the possibility of Luo Zheng defeating Lone now.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie quietly looked at her husband's calm face and smiled. "I believe he will win in the end," she said.</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason?" Preston asked as he stared at her. However, Ning Yudie shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>She didn't need a reason to believe him, for she would always believe him regardless.</p>

  <p>It was because Luo Zheng had never let her down ever since the day they met.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the battle of the Heaven Earth Board commenced.</p>

  <p>Lone firmly gripped his sword as he charged forward towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most people would be more cautious when faced against the extremely sharp Saint Killing Spear, but Lone's dark iron sword hinted to him that it could crush Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Lone's thin body went straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lone's movement technique was a rather ordinary one. It was the most common movement technique of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Even then, no one would think badly of Lone because the sword he wielded was a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The moment Lone rushed halfway, the dark iron sword suddenly emitted a faint golden light and released a special power.</p>

  <p>"Kill him! Show him the power of a supreme chaotic weapon!"</p>

  <p>The battle reached its climax as the dark iron sword's will gradually merged with Lone.</p>

  <p>When Lone was engaged in a fierce battle, he would become a puppet to the dark iron sword. Lone voluntarily did that, and after having accompanied Lone for a long time--the sword could become one with him now.</p>

  <p>"Chaotic Life Vitality Strike!"</p>

  <p>The golden light which was the Metal Law was clearly quite sharp as it glinted in the sword light. However, there was a strange faint grey light mixed with the sword light.</p>

  <p>Nathan and the others also noticed the grey light, and were mildly surprised.</p>

  <p>What was that power?</p>

  <p>It was known that these Godly Geniuses had all learned remarkable techniques passed down from the top warriors in the universe.</p>

  <p>They had experienced much more than even some of the world lords of the small supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Lone's strike wasn't a special move. Although the Metal Law was sharp, many ace talents could control it. It was simply the profound mystery of the sixth-layer Metal Law.</p>

  <p>However, what on earth was that faint grey light?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a deep frown on Janet's face when she saw the grey light.</p>

  <p>After Cindy had been eliminated, the battles in the painting didn't matter to her clan any more.</p>

  <p>Still, most people still wanted to watch the battles among these Godly Geniuses. They could learn a lot from the battles which was helpful for their cultivation.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Janet felt that the Lofty Wood inside her body began to move wildly.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be anxious because of hunger. It also began to twitch when the faint grey light appeared.</p>

  <p>How could the faint grey light cause such a reaction from her Lofty Wood?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also stunned, but for a different reason.</p>

  <p>The grey light was something he was quite familiar with. It was chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng had activated the chaotic sea, he had replaced the life vitality with the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>There was no application method for chaotic energy in the Primal Chaos Technique--but since chaos created everything, it was purer and more powerful than life vitality. It was a huge benefit for his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Still, it wasn't a proper use of the chaotic energy--or was it?</p>

  <p>It was actually a careless omission by Zheng's master.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng's master didn't expect that someone would really succeed in cultivating the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>Were there cultivation methods on the use of the chaotic energy in the divine land?</p>

  <p>Clearly, there were!</p>

  <p>However, even a True God would die at a mere touch of the chaotic energy. It was what made it difficult to use.</p>

  <p>Although the True Gods couldn't use the chaotic energy directly, there were two things they could use.</p>

  <p>The first were the four divine woods, and the second were the supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>Just like what the iron sword said, the four divine woods were located in four directions. They were nourished by chaos.</p>

  <p>Their hundred million mile-long roots grew outside the Sighing Wall and continuously absorbed the chaotic energy. Only the divine woods nourished with the chaotic energy could support the huge divine land.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy was immensely powerful, so there were always True Gods who planned to use it.</p>

  <p>A few gifted masters were born after millions of years of study. They had succeeded in making supreme chaotic weapons using the chaotic energy as one of the materials.</p>

  <p>These weapons were formed in the chaos, so they could control the chaotic energy to some extent.</p>

  <p>One of those weapons was Lone's dark iron sword, a supreme chaotic weapon from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Although the sword was broken and its power and spirituality were much less now, it was still a supreme weapon that was refined in chaos. Thus, it was normal for it to emit faint grey light.</p>
