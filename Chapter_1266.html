<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Kane disappeared, Kenneth was the only representative of the Cloud Hall in the Eastern Region, so who in the Burning Sky Palace could stand against him?</p>

  <p>The Burning Sky Empire was merely an empire of mortals. They were as weak as infants in front of the warriors. No matter who the emperor was, what the powerful warriors decided was taken as the final word.</p>

  <p>The officials of the imperial court were stunned at seeing what had happened, but no one dared say anything about it. As for the several Internal Elixir Realm warriors who lived in the Burning Sky Palace, none of them were willing to meddle in the matter.</p>

  <p>Kenneth had given Mu Ning two options. The first had been to depose Ray and ascend to the throne. The second one was to head for the Central Region to be with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Aura's decision surprised Kenneth. She did not choose to kill Ray to become the first empress of the Burning Sky Empire. She also did not leave the Eastern Region. Instead, she went back to Drizzle Peak of the Cloud Sect to continue to be a master.</p>

  <p>Kenneth told Luo Zheng about what Mu Ning had done while he had not been present in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded lightly, a smile appearing on his face. It had to be said that Kenneth had done well enough. However, it surprised Luo Zheng that Mu Ning was willing to stay at Drizzle Peak permanently.</p>

  <p>The two of them spoke through life vitality. "What are you guys talking about?" Ning Yudie asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Uh..." Kenneth was filled with embarrassment. Since Luo Zheng was using his life vitality to communicate with him, he naturally did not want to let the two women next to him in on the conversation. Kenneth could not reveal what they were talking about. He did not know what to say to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "It's nothing," he said. "Just some events that happened at the Cloud Sect. Tia, Mu Ning, now that you two are here, you should ask Master Shi to take you around. I have something to deal with."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stayed silent, her eyes fixed on Luo Zheng. When she saw the gleam in his eyes, she immediately guessed at what the matter was.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ning Yudie could not figure out what was going on. "What is it?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"Master Ning, please follow me," Kenneth said quickly. "I will be showing you the various peaks of the Cloud Sect later..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made up an excuse and left. Mu Ning and Ning Yudie followed Kenneth, heading straight to the other direction.</p>

  <p>The moment Kenneth entered the main hall, he asked the maids to serve them food. However, before they could enter the hall, Mu Ning came to stand at the gates.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie glanced at Mu Ning. "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled. "Nothing. I can sense that something is wrong."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong this time?" Ning Yudie asked her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not respond to this. She raised her head and entered the main hall.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie frowned, not knowing what was going on in Margaret's head. She stepped forward cautiously and blocked Margaret's path, asking, "What exactly happened? Is this about Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, of course, knew Ning Yudie very well. She could tell that Ning Yudie was clueless about this. However, Mu Ning did not want to interfere in Zheng's matters, or rather, she did not dare meddle at all. Ning Yudie had no such qualms. Mu Ning kept her in suspense just to lure her into questioning about what had happened.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Ning Yudie was curious about Margaret's behavior.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled. "Yes, but I think we should not meddle in his affairs."</p>

  <p>"What on earth is going on?" suspicious, Ning Yudie asked her in a low voice.</p>

  <p>In the hall, Kenneth had already ordered the maids to prepare tea and dessert for Ning Yudie and Mu Ning. Even the tables and chairs had been arranged for them. He was now patiently waiting for them to enter the hall. For a moment, he considered gathering the elite disciples of the thirty-three peaks of Cloud Sect together and letting them perform their martial arts before Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>However, the two women still stood at the entrance, chatting in low voices.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng was born in the Eastern Region," Mu Ning said indifferently. "He is not a man who associates with a lot of women, but I think he is still affectionate toward someone here. I wonder who that person is."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was obviously jealous at this. She was not like Mu Ning. Eager to be the best and possessive about everything, she could not stand to share the man she loved. Allowing Mu Ning to remain by Zheng's side had already touched a nerve. Now it seemed that Mu Ning had not been the first woman she had to endure at all. Perhaps not the last one either!</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie tried her best to be in control of her emotions, the expression on her face betrayed her discomfort.</p>

  <p>Seeing how upset she was, Mu Ning giggled. "It is okay for men to have several wives. If a man doesn't have at least a few of them, that would be considered abnormal."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Ning Yudie rushed into the main hall. Before Kenneth could get a chance to lead her to her seat, she sat down by herself in a huff, leaning against the giant dragon throne in the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>Seeing the indignant expression on Yudie's face, Kenneth tensed up, not daring to speak.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning walked up to Ning Yudie calmly and sat down beside her. "No matter what, this is Zheng's choice," she said to her seriously. "He is already your husband, so you can't be this angry at him."</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were not close like sisters or even on good terms with each other, they seemed to live in harmony for they had stayed together for quite some time. Now, sharing such an experience of misfortune, they had pity for each other.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to go and have a look?" Mu Ning suddenly said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie didn't even think before replying, "I don't want to!"</p>

  <p>"You really don't want to?" Mu Ning slid closer to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to..." Yudie's words were clearly not as resolute as before.</p>

  <p>Seeing the mocking expression on Margaret's face, she said, "Let's sneak over then."</p>

  <p>Kenneth tried to intervene, hesitating for a while before Ning Yudie interrupted him coldly. "Kenneth, where is Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Surprised, Kenneth did not know how to answer her. Once again, an awkward expression surfaced on his face.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to look for him myself?" Ning Yudie asked as she stared at Kenneth.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dare do that. Luo Zheng went to Drizzle Peak. I will lead you there,"</p>

  <p>Kenneth responded almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was the top leader after all, so Kenneth would rather offend Luo Zheng than her. Besides, Luo Zheng was a man more magnanimous than a woman.</p>

  <p>Even though Ning Yudie was usually decisive, Kenneth didn't believe that she could be generous in matters of affection.</p>

  <p>With Kenneth in the lead, the two women went straight toward the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>A few months ago, to resist the black energy, Luo Zheng had destroyed the mountains of the great world. However, in the end, he had preserved those of the Eastern Region, including the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the thirty-three peaks of the Cloud Sect would have been annihilated at the time.</p>

  <p>Staying at the bottom of the mountain for a while, Luo Zheng flew upward.</p>

  <p>The mountainside of Drizzle Peak was where the outer disciples lived.</p>

  <p>Above the mountainside was where the masters were. When Luo Zheng flew over, he saw a large number of warriors gather there.</p>

  <p>"The battle ring?" Zheng's eyes flashed as he took a long breath. He slowly approached them.</p>

  <p>Two disciples in black robes could be seen fighting on the battle ring.</p>

  <p>'Why are the inner disciples fighting here?' Luo Zheng thought, a bit puzzled. A smile split his lips when he spotted someone. "There's Nory!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Nory had been Zheng's first friend when he had entered the Cloud Sect. His temperament had clearly undergone a great change; different from what it had been when before. Most importantly, he had already become an inner disciple.</p>

  <p>His talent was average and he didn't have enough willpower. Most of the time, it was only because of Zheng's encouragement that Nory was able to brace himself and progress on his cultivation. Back then, Luo Zheng had stepped up and taken action against the master of the Mo Clan because of Nory...</p>

  <p>It seemed that after he left, Nory had put in a great deal of effort into his cultivation. At the moment, he was standing on the battle ring, his life vitality exploding through. But his opponent's strength was not to be taken lightly, who might be even more powerful than Nory. However, Nory's willpower was unmatched. No matter how strong the opponent's counterattack, Nory could resist it. He would not be willing to retreat or give in.</p>

  <p>Nory had indeed changed...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed silently, but as he continued to observe the battle, he frowned.</p>

  <p>The other warrior on the battle ring was obviously much stronger. He seemed to fight Nory effortlessly. There was an obvious playful expression on his face as he continued to strain Nory with his attacks. It was noisy but Luo Zheng could still hear the warrior's comment. "You people are delusional. The Drizzle Peak doesn't have it in them to be ranked as number one among the thirty-three peaks!" he spoke with a sneer. "Only Luo Zheng was the outstanding one here. After he left, this place turned just as ordinary as before."</p>
