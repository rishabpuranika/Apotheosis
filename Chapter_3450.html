  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had stayed in that void for three and a half years.</p>

  <p>However, since King Manard had absolute control over the void, he was able to find the right time node and send Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Chaotic Source World, the glimmering space fragments kept circling around Mount.</p>

  <p>The fragments were palm-sized at most but they were quite sharp and indestructible, extremely hard to resist.</p>

  <p>However, like Mount, the Evil God could also use Grand Teleportation to move around freely within the world.</p>

  <p>Mount had launched a series of supposedly deadly attacks but the Evil God had dodged every single one easily.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Evil God had even counterattacked!</p>

  <p>These space fragments were Mount's temporary protective shield as he tried to catch his breath.</p>

  <p>"Give up! Once I take your abilities, even your will shall follow me," the Evil God declared. He was flashing in midair and his voice boomed and echoed all around the space, seemingly coming from everywhere.</p>

  <p>Mount gritted his teeth in anger. "You're not qualified!"</p>

  <p>"I'll be qualified after I kill you."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's words were whispered in Mount's ear. He had appeared right beside Mount regardless of those space fragments!</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>Mount quickly wielded the space fragments and directed them towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Any ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm would've been killed after getting hit by these space fragments.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God was no ordinary warrior. His entire body had been reinforced by the Mighty Golden Body and all the space fragments could do was scratch him in multiple places.</p>

  <p>"Sizz..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's wounds healed in the blink of an eye, courtesy of a small race's bloodline token. So long as his elixir field and soul remained intact, his body would recover and he would never die!</p>

  <p>He was, in one word: invincible. The multiple bloodline theurgies he had absorbed ensured his protection. With a slight wave of his hand, the Evil God threw a fist towards Mount in spite of the bombardment of space fragments.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Mount felt the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess wrap around him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, most super forces chose to watch as this battle continued to unfold before them.</p>

  <p>The Evil God belonged to the infamous Black Ship while Mount was from the Divine Farmer race. Everyone hated the Black Ship but nobody would come to Mount's aid since the Divine Farmer race, the Jin Wu, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race had been blown away by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Yan watched the fight with concern, all the while instructing the other disciples of the Li Shan mountain to stand aside and stay out of danger.</p>

  <p>"Yan, which one should we help?" Natalie asked.</p>

  <p>Yan was caught in quite a sticky situation. Mount had exiled her brother and it would make sense to delight in his misery.</p>

  <p>However, his opponent was the Evil God!</p>

  <p>She truly couldn't understand how a being with such strong destructive instincts was birthed in her brother's inner world.</p>

  <p>Mount served as a temporary deterrent to the Evil God's rampage. Once he inevitably died by his invincible opponent's hands, everyone else was next.</p>

  <p>Natalie had foreseen this and found it best to ask Yan for her opinion. The only favorable option right now was to help Mount.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Taiyi Heaven Palace was also in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, they, along with the Li Shan mountain, planned on forcing Mount to hand Luo Zheng over.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Mount declared Luo Zheng as someone who had been deleted, with no possibility of ever getting back.</p>

  <p>How would they let Mount go in this case?</p>

  <p>After they finally restricted Mount's power, the Evil God interfered suddenly and now seemed to be ready to come for everyone else. The situation became inexplicably complicated.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I should remove my abacus..." Chaim murmured in consideration.</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Feng Ge protested. "Luo Zheng is still under his control!"</p>

  <p>"If he's dead, then we will lose our last sliver of hope," Ling Shuang spoke.</p>

  <p>She wholeheartedly believed that Mount had lied to all of them. She knew for a fact that warriors who were good enough at the space token always had a way to take back what they had exiled.</p>

  <p>However, Mount hadn't been lying.</p>

  <p>Not even the Chaos Ancient God, having lost control of the space, could take Luo Zheng back.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Among everyone in the Chaotic Source World, Mount's physical strength came only second to Luo Zheng's after Luo Zheng activated the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>His corporeal body was extremely solid, however, it was no match to the shadow of Snake Goddess's extremely erosive power.</p>

  <p>A tentacle skimmed the surface of Mount's body, leaving behind a deep blood groove on his tan, bronze skin.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, his entire body was covered with horrible wounds from the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to be killed by me like this?" the Evil God asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>He was so clever that he could almost guess what Mount wanted to do.</p>

  <p>Mount could freely move within the space.</p>

  <p>So long as he wanted, he could easily leave the area covered by the Evil God's world. If the Evil God followed and left this world, all the bloodline theurgies he gained would fail to work.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was clear that Mount could make such judgments with his keen observation.</p>

  <p>He definitely had some plans up his sleeve. Why else would he dare fight against him?</p>

  <p>This was the reason why the Evil God remained on high alert during their entire battle.</p>

  <p>Mount who just suffered immensely from his shadow of Snake Goddess could use Grand Teleportation to escape obviously. But why did he choose to stay?</p>

  <p>"You can't kill me, but I can kill you," Mount murmured despite all his wounds. Light flashed in his eyes as a cube formed in his pupil.</p>

  <p>The space fragments were still flying around them like a dangerous storm.</p>

  <p>In a flash, they seemed to be enlightened and began to array neatly around, wrapping the two warriors.</p>

  <p>"In your world, you can copy other people's bloodlines but there are limits to this ability," Mount said in a calm, collected manner. "You can copy only around 30 to 40 percent of my bloodline power, hence you can make spatial transference but not activate the other theurgies hidden within."</p>

  <p>Before Mount could finish his words, the Evil God quickly paled and intended to leave via Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to use it, he realized that it didn't seem to be working!</p>

  <p>Mount simply stared at him blankly. "This is the Hypercube Imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Its space restriction is even stronger than that of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>There is no way for you to get rid of it."</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors had previously banded together to set up the Chaotic Source World's space restrictions. To do that, they used the Truth of Void Destruction and the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens. Mount's bloodline, however, was related to a truth, which meant that his imprisonment methods were far greater!</p>
