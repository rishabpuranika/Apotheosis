<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3754 A Pair Of Giant Hands </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Both Libby and Elizabeth were also extremely nervous.</p>

  <p>While they couldn't see the giant with their own eyes, they had already been attacked by his hands before.</p>

  <p>If his strike landed, they would both have already been dead.</p>

  <p>But they were left with no other choice.</p>

  <p>Covered by the Divine Fire Shield, Zheng retreated step by step.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Moon Fire Slaves moved forward at the same pace, with the Chill Ice Slaves and the Magical Thunder Slaves approaching from the other directions.</p>

  <p>Three thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Two thousand feet...</p>

  <p>When Zheng retreated to within two thousand feet from the Cold Prison, the Five-Element Slaves entered the bald giant's range of attack.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, Zheng observed the creature when he could.</p>

  <p>The giant maintained his original posture, keeping his eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>'The giant seems really calm, ' Zheng thought to himself. 'Does he want to capture all these Five-Element Slaves in one go?'</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Zheng turned back frequently, which drew the Five-Element Slaves' attention.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slave leading the group chuckled, "Brat, why do you keep looking back? Can you see what's in the Cold Prison??"</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Magical Thunder Slaves all knew of the bald giant trapped in the Cold Prison. To get him in there, the Element Spirit race had to pour in great effort? as the slaves of this race, they had to do everything just to imprison the creature.</p>

  <p>But now that the bald giant was trapped, he could barely move, and was no longer as threatening as he had been before.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Moon Fire Slave couldn't help but feel a bit confused by Zheng's behavior.</p>

  <p>Zheng should have only been seeing light dots in the Cold Prison, so what was he looking at?</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued retreating, he smiled as he said, "Of course I can."</p>

  <p>"If you can see clearly, then can you tell me what lies in the Cold Prison?" from the left, a Magical Thunder Slave sneered.</p>

  <p>Naturally, none of them believed Zheng could see within the prison.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed at the challenge.</p>

  <p>It was a critical moment.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had correctly guessed the bald giant's mental state.</p>

  <p>He had been intensely irritable since his imprisonment? he hated all creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder he launched an attack at Zheng the moment he woke up.</p>

  <p>Two reasons kept Zheng from successfully communicating with the bald giant. On the one hand, he couldn't pronounce the Sanskrit words, and on the other hand, the bald giant was immediately hostile toward him.</p>

  <p>But judging from how the giant patiently waited for the Five-Element Slaves to continue approaching, he was not stupid by any means.</p>

  <p>And so now, Zheng had to make sure the giant knew he was an enemy to the Five-Element Slaves.</p>

  <p>While the giant possibly already knew the fact, Zheng needed to deepen his impression.</p>

  <p>An enemy's enemy was a friend, after all.</p>

  <p>In his mind, Zheng made contact with the Primeval Lord of Heaven. In mere seconds, he replied, "There is a bald giant in the Cold Prison."</p>

  <p>Zheng's answer completely stunned the Moon Fire Slaves. They hadn't expected him to get it right.</p>

  <p>Could he truly see what was happening in the Cold Prison, they wondered?</p>

  <p>While they were stuck in a daze, Zheng abruptly rushed forward, grasping the Divine Fire Shield in his hand. As he closed the distance, he called in his mind, 'Primeval Lord of Heaven, please take action!'</p>

  <p>He had to keep the shield in place to protect Elizabeth and Libby, hindering him from properly fighting. All he could do was leave it up to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>With an energy soul's strength, it was impossible for the Primeval Lord of Heaven to defeat all the Five-Element Slaves, but at the very least, he could easily kill off one or two Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng rushed forward rapidly, the shadow of the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared, pointing ahead of him.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Using the book's power, he shot out a ray of light from his fingertip.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the ray pierced through the spiritual core within the body of the Moon Fire Slave right in front of the group.</p>

  <p>The body began trembling instantaneously, the green flames in his body surging before getting extinguished in the next second. His armor disintegrated and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>By killing one of them, Zheng wanted to signal to the giant that he was on the opposite side of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>From where he was, he couldn't quite tell if his action was effective enough.</p>

  <p>He figured he'd have to leave it up to fate.</p>

  <p>The moment the Moon Fire Slave was killed, Zheng retreated.</p>

  <p>In the next instant, he was flying over five hundred feet before reaching the edge of the Cold Prison. If he took another mere step, he would have fallen in.</p>

  <p>Despite the Divine Fire Shield's protection, Zheng and the two girls could still feel a chill creeping up their backs.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already killed one of their companions, and the Moon Fire Slave died because of his spiritual core breaking? this meant complete death.</p>

  <p>All the Five-Element Slaves flew forward into a rage.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Their initially gentle approach turned into a high-speed chase heading straight after Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Brat! How dare you! We won't let you die so easily!" roared one of the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>'What are you waiting for?'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought to himself, turning back to the bald giant. To his surprise, the creature's eyes met his? it wasn't until that moment that Zheng noticed a faint smile on the giant's face.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the giant had just seen through him.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves were closing in on Zheng, only worsening his anxiety.</p>

  <p>If the giant didn't make a move, Zheng was as good as dead at that moment.</p>

  <p>When the Moon Fire Slaves were only about a hundred feet away from Zheng and the girls, countless dots of light within the Cold Prison suddenly curled up.</p>

  <p>A pair of giant hands extended from it, slamming down right before Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With an explosive sound, the pair of giant hands slapped about eight Moon Fire Slaves who were rushing ahead of the group on the icy surface.</p>

  <p>The hands continued rolling on the ice.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the bald giant's first time fighting the Element Spirit race, so he knew that the flame creatures were driven by spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>By rolling his hands, he ground and crushed all the Moon Fire Slaves' armors, along with their bodies' spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>When the giant raised his hands, only armor debris remained on the ice, while the Moon Fire Slaves perished along with their spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>The Chill Ice Slaves and the Magical Thunder Slaves were all stunned by the sudden attack.</p>

  <p>All of them froze abruptly.</p>

  <p>Without anyone to give an order, they didn't know how to deal with the situation? they were all hesitant and stuck in place.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The giant's hands moved decisively toward the Chill Ice Slaves at an incredible speed? he swatted at them as though they were mere mosquitoes in summer.</p>

  <p>The Chill Ice Slaves immediately changed their form once they saw the hands approaching.</p>

  <p>But just as the Moon Fire Slaves did, the Chill Ice Slaves' lives depended on their spiritual cores. They only differed in that the Moon Fire Slaves had fire spiritual cores, while Chill Ice Slaves had water spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>As the giant hands continued rolling over the icy surface, the Chill Ice Slaves perished.</p>

  <p>And with that, the bald giant then targeted the Magical Thunder Slaves.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the bald giant was much smarter than Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>The creature seemed to know that the Magical Thunder Slaves lacked spiritual cores, making them a more difficult kill. So his hands suddenly flew in the air, pushing the Magical Thunder Slaves into the Cold Prison.</p>
