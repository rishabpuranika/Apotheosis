<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1386 The Cold Plum Blood Spear </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Gathering the heavenly essence was not a difficult task for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the past, he was restricted by his own sacred weapon body, but now that he was more powerful, he was no longer stopped by it.</p>

  <p>His physical body had already become a divine weapon. Although he didn't know what grade of weapon it was, it would definitely be able to contain more than ten thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng suddenly patted his head in self-assurance.</p>

  <p>Would his body become a supreme divine weapon if it continued to gain more power?</p>

  <p>'I've heard that the Universe Spirit Tablet is very special. Although the Law of Causality contained within it is useless in battle, it could detect all the magic weapons in the universe, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>If his physical body became so strong, would his name also appear on the Universe Spirit Tablet?</p>

  <p>Impressive as it was, Luo Zheng did not consider this a good thing for himself.</p>

  <p>He didn't want his special physique to be exposed to others.</p>

  <p>Hence he voiced his concern.</p>

  <p>Both Xun and the cyan dragon passed their judgment at the same time, believing that it was indeed possible for his name to appear on the Universe Spirit Tablet!</p>

  <p>His current physical body appeared to be made of flesh and blood, but his essence had already been changed by the Divine Flame Cauldron. In many ways, his body had the characteristics of a weapon.</p>

  <p>One might say that he was half-human and half-weapon...</p>

  <p>This sort of situation had never taken place in the universe before.</p>

  <p>Xun and the cyan dragon thought it might be possible, but they were not a hundred percent certain that his name would really appear on the Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stopped in front of the lightning waterfall, the world lord of the Sunset World, Yolande and other palace leaders thought he was about to cross it.</p>

  <p>Even Yolande was starting to get nervous. If Luo Zheng really did cross it, she would personally go in the waterfall and bring him out...</p>

  <p>However, after reaching thirty-six thousand miles, Luo Zheng paused for a moment and changed his mind. Then, he suddenly appeared at the entrance of the Enchanted Barrier Tower!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng's physical body upgraded to another level as he got burnt by the Profound Flame. His clothes were charred, so he took out a spare set of white clothes and put them on. He looked vivacious and extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Many warriors who had returned from the Enchanted Barrier Tower were either injured or covered in dirt. Luo Zheng had traveled thirty-six thousand miles, going twice as far as Supreme Lord Illusion and eight thousand miles farther than Layla. It was not hard for the warriors of the thirteen palaces to imagine the danger involved in this journey.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng looked perfectly fine, as if he had just returned from a vacation.</p>

  <p>Many warriors were speechless and surprised, while some were indignant. The gap between them and Luo Zheng was just too large. They began to wonder if he had cheated in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>However, with so many palace leaders and the world lord watching, it was close to impossible to cheat. The truth was that they only accused him falsely in their minds to make themselves feel better.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, come up," Yolande said gracefully.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and with a stomp of his foot, he flew to the top of the building and his eyes met Layla's.</p>

  <p>If he had come out a little earlier, Layla would have glared at him.</p>

  <p>However, she had managed to compose herself, so she sportingly said,</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>He nodded slightly in acknowledgement and turned to look at Yolande.</p>

  <p>Layla, however, continued to study him, thinking to herself, 'I believe I can get another chance to defeat you...'</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled faintly at Luo Zheng. "I don't think that anyone can ace your score in the future. You didn't disappoint me. Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Yolande looked at the Sunset World lord beside her and introduced him to Luo Zheng, "This is the lord of Sunset World. He has promised that there would be rewards for breaking twenty thousand miles and thirty thousand miles!"</p>

  <p>"There are rewards, too?" asked Luo Zheng with his heart racing.</p>

  <p>He had heard that there were rewards for traveling one thousand miles, three thousand miles and ten thousand miles. He wasn't aware of any other rewards. He tried his best to travel thirty-six thousand miles without even knowing that there was a reward for him at the finish line.</p>

  <p>However, if the world lord of a supreme world was offering him a reward, he would definitely accept it...</p>

  <p>The lord of Sunset World had made a promise in front of everyone, so he naturally wouldn't go back on his words. The world lord gazed at Luo Zheng before smiling lightly. "Young man, I have been forced by Yolande to provide the reward of reaching thirty thousand miles. So I've decided to give you these rewards. As for the reward of traveling twenty thousand miles, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"What do I want?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered slightly, and he already had something in mind.</p>

  <p>"Spear! I want a spear!" he demanded excitedly.</p>

  <p>"A spear?" Layla, who was at the side, couldn't help but ask incredulously, "What do you want a spear for? Aren't you adept at using a sword? Can you even use a spear?"</p>

  <p>He actually wanted the spear for Xun. Now the sword spirit had strengthened and more than half of Xun's soul had also recovered, but she didn't have a proper weapon to use.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had wanted to enter the Weapon House to help Xun choose a spear, but he didn't get the chance as he didn't have enough life vitality jades...</p>

  <p>Yolande, of course, understood this. The Demon Night's Queen of Killings usually used a spear, and Luo Zheng was trying to help Xun. He had found the right person to ask for this weapon!</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," the lord of Sunset World chortled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>The world lord of the Sunset World said, "What a coincidence! My usual weapon of choice is also a spear!"</p>

  <p>Then several rays of light shot out behind the lord of Sunset World, and floated out in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You can choose any one of these four spears," the lord of Sunset World said, with a smug expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Since the world lord's preferred weapon was a spear, he naturally possessed many good spears. The four spears floating in front of Luo Zheng were with different colors and lengths, and each of them had varied levels of power but they were all extraordinary.</p>

  <p>When Yolande saw the four spears, she smiled at the world lord and remarked, "I believe you might have more than four good spears."</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World smiled. "Indeed, these four spears can all be listed on the Universe Spirit Tablet. However, I still have two first-rank divine weapons, and they can be ranked in the top four thousand on the Universe Spirit Tablet. They are only second to the supreme divine weapons. If Luo Zheng picks one of the two first-rank weapons right now, I'm afraid I will have no other powerful weapons to give him as the reward for reaching thirty thousand miles..."</p>

  <p>A first-rank divine weapon that ranked in the top four thousand was considered a remarkable divine weapon. The top three thousand weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet were all supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Yolande said to Luo Zheng, "If you choose the first-rank spear, the lord of the Sunset World will give it to you now, but he will not give you any other reward. That means you can only get one prize even though you have broken two records and are eligible for two prizes."</p>

  <p>Now the ball was in Zheng's court. He would have to make a choice.</p>

  <p>Xun said flatly, "Luo Zheng, you don't need to use up two rewards for the spear."</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was still hesitant. He considered Xun to be very powerful.</p>

  <p>If he could help her get an even better spear, he would not think twice about it. He didn't care whether he was sacrificing one or two rewards for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Reading his thoughts, Xun said, "No need! I just want the black spear on the right side."</p>

  <p>Since Xun was determined not to get the first-rank spear, Luo Zheng could no longer insist on it. He nodded to the lord of the Sunset World and said, "There's no need. I want this spear!" said Luo Zheng pointing at the black spear on the far right.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" A look of surprise flashed across the Sunset World lord's face.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a really in-depth knowledge of spears. Or is it someone else who gave you this advice?" he asked looking in the direction of Yolande.</p>

  <p>The four spears were ranked at around nine thousand on the Universe Spirit Tablet, and the Cold Plum Blood Spear that Luo Zheng selected was the best among the four options he was given. It currently ranked nine thousand and thirty-sixth.</p>

  <p>Every month, the Universe Spirit Tablet would be refreshed and the words written on it would change. The rankings of the weapons also changed constantly, and the lower the grade of the weapon was, the more its rank fluctuated. However, this Cold Plum Blood Spear was more prized than the other three spears.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had chosen it without thinking too much, so the lord of the Sunset World believed that it was Yolande who advised him to pick that spear.</p>

  <p>Yolande naturally knew that it was Xun who had asked Luo Zheng to choose that spear. She shook her head and said to the lord of the Sunset World, "I have never spoken to Luo Zheng through my life vitality. Besides, you can always feel the life vitality fluctuations."</p>
