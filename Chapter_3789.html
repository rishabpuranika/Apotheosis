</p>

  <p>"How can I enter the world contained in the second volume?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked after strolling around the temple.</p>

  <p>The temple really existed, but it was in the form of an exquisite image before Luo Zheng's eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng even saw three figures at the side of the temple. Perhaps because these three people were Souls of Light, their appearance was still indistinct.</p>

  <p>Pearce held out his hand, and a dazzling-white light appeared on his palm.</p>

  <p>He slapped his glowing palm hard on the bronze ground, and a bright white vortex burst forth from the ground.</p>

  <p>"This is the entrance," Pearce declared.</p>

  <p>"The light in your hand seems to be the same as that from the distance," Luo Zheng said. The mystery had piqued his interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Pearce nodded and said. "The light coming from afar is to lead people into the painting. Through the Light Stone, we can gather and wield this kind of light. If we need it, we can release this white vortex and gain entry into the second volume."</p>

  <p>Having explained, Pearce gently turned his ring and retrieved an oval stone from his Sumeru Space. It looked like a shiny cobblestone, and emanated brilliant snow-white light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Pearce gently tossed it at Luo Zheng and said, "All the most powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm who have entered Stage Thirty-two are required to journey to the temple and retrieve such a Light Stone. I have a spare. Here you go."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the Light Stone in his hand and examined it closely. Then Pearce continued, "You can try to forge an entrance."</p>

  <p>"I see!" Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>As the white vortex Pearce had created gradually dissipated, Luo Zheng also grabbed the Light Stone and slammed it onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The light stored in the Light Stone immediately exploded from inside and struck the ground, creating a bright white vortex.</p>

  <p>"You can step inside now," said Pearce, smiling.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng entered the white vortex, the Grand Plain Stage seemed to have disappeared.</p>

  <p>He had been transported to the world contained in the second volume. The sight that greeted his eyes was the temple built by the Taiyi Heaven Palace in Stage Thirty-two!</p>

  <p>Pearce and Li Bianxue had also followed Luo Zheng into the vortex. They materialized in the world in the scroll painting instantaneously.</p>

  <p>"The world within this scroll painting is a real world," Luo Zheng said. "So, the first volume in the sky of the Grand Plain Stage is also another world?"</p>

  <p>This kind of reasoning was probably not flawed. However, Pearce shook his head and disagreed, "I heard from Eastern Emperor Taiyi that there is a big difference between the two."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had seen, the second volume was yet another world. However, everything in this world was represented in 2D relief by the pictures on the bronze ground, so the first volume should be similar.</p>

  <p>Most people made this deduction before they entered the world of the first volume. But, in fact, the two volumes were not alike at all.</p>

  <p>The world in the first volume was a completely different landscape. All living forms were displayed in a unique form.</p>

  <p>"It is like a whole person has been completely flattened into a painting, and everything in it is flat," said Pearce with a smile. "That's how Eastern Emperor Taiyi put it at that time. But unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to enter it, so I didn't have the chance to see that wondrous vista."</p>

  <p>Hearing Pearce's description, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement. As soon as he was ready, he also wanted to enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting and discover what lay within.</p>

  <p>At this point, four Souls of Light also materialized in the temple.</p>

  <p>Taking the lead were none other than Auden and Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>The world of the second volume in Stage Thirty-two was endlessly vast.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone who entered the painting aspired to build a temple for their own race. After some Other Shore races had perished, the temples of their races were then abandoned there, naturally becoming places of exploration to others.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were engaged in explorations of the world in the second volume, hoping to discover mightily powerful Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Other Shore Tokens of Stage Thirty-two were already impressive. If a warrior was lucky enough, they could even unearth a Civilization Artifact. For example, the leader of the Bright Mountain had dug up a Civilization Artifact somewhere in Stage thirty-two.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light who could enter the Grand Plain Stage were naturally the central figures of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had existed in the Grand Plain Stage for so long. Although it was not as lucrative as those of the Other Shore creatures, it still contained some treasures.</p>

  <p>In addition to giving Li Bianxue a Light Stone, Qiu Yinhe also knocked over a wall of the temple in which, they could see a range of Other Shore Tokens embedded. A powerful aura of energy was surging within them.</p>

  <p>"Although these Other Shore Tokens don't hold a candle to those in the Three Purities Stage, they are already at the top of the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>You can choose one according to your unique needs," Qiu Yinhe stated.</p>

  <p>The temple in Stage Four also offered Other Shore Tokens. However, there were too many disciples who entered Stage Four, so they were chosen by a selection process.</p>

  <p>However, those who were able to enter the Grand Plain Stage became like the treasures of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and they were rare. So, naturally, they could choose any Other Shore Token they desired among those collected in the palace.</p>

  <p>At the sight of those Other Shore Tokens, Li Bianxue's eyes glowed with desire.</p>

  <p>Her Other Shore Token originated from Stage Twenty-eight. If she could replace it with a fourth-grade one from the Grand Plain Stage, it would increase her strength tremendously!</p>

  <p>By comparison, Luo Zheng lacked all interest in them. After all, he had already merged with three Civilization Artifacts, and he no longer had any extra Truth of Divine Dao to fuse with an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>When Li Bianxue was choosing an Other Shore Token, Luo Zheng thought of something and asked, "Primeval Lord of Heaven, since the Taiyi Heaven Palace can also build a temple here, then the human race must have also constructed one here, right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, we did," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "We had created a lot of temples. We must have left behind more than 20 temples?</p>

  <p>The human heroes like the Snake Goddess and Fuxi had been considered great forces within the 77th civilization. Upon reaching the Eternal Realm, they were naturally eager to build a temple for their own race. At that time, the human ancestor had also built a temple for the human race."</p>

  <p>"Are these temples still standing in the Grand Plain Stage?" Luo Zheng asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>"They've been destroyed," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, a trace of regret in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Destroyed?" Luo Zheng was stunned. "If those temples were destroyed by the Element Spirit race, then why didn't they demolish the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace?"</p>

  <p>At that time, the human race had been a powerful force. As a ruling force, it had been much stronger than the current super forces like the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race, and the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Even the humans at that time were unable to remain in Stage Thirty-two, why did the Element Spirit race let go of the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace?</p>

  <p>"Because there exists a set of protection rules for the creatures currently in the chaos," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "Before the end of this round of chaos, no powerful Other Shore race, no matter whether it is the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race, can attack the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace or those of the Ear Mouse race and the Separate Abyss race."</p>
