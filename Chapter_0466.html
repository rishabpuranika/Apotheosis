<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lily's features and appearance weren't consistent with an average person.</p>

  <p>Her hair looked softer, and there was a fresh and young aura about her with a cropped beveled fringe.</p>

  <p>Under those soft thin locks of hair resided her white and delicate face.</p>

  <p>With all parts of her face exactly matching with each other, she was highly attractive and beautiful. Right now, her pretty face was expressionless. But it could be imagined just how charming she would be if she started smiling.</p>

  <p>Her costume was completely different from what was usually worn in the Eastern Region. Even the Central Region wouldn't have been bold enough like her. Unlike the conservative style of women across those regions, her dress style was much more open and bolder. For example, the upper armor she wore only covered her upper chest, showing her good figure and shape. Her bare waist looked even more slender under the armor she wore. Her long and slender legs were also visible in the short dress she wore. Even though her height was similar to that of Zheng, she looked taller because of the differing ratios of their figures and her slender legs.</p>

  <p>It had to be said that Lily, with her amazing figure and remarkable face, had perfectly copied the appearance of that lady from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>She looked vividly beautiful even with her stiff expression. Almost every single member of the audience was baffled by her good looks and sudden appearance. Instead of trying to venture a guess to the identity of this beautiful lady, they were confused about from where this lady had come from.</p>

  <p>There were also several spectators who were following the competition from outside the arena. For example, in Lady Peak, a large picture slab had been kept in the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>Normally, the female disciples of Cloud Sect were more fastidious about their environment than male disciples. An example of it could be seen at Drizzle Peak where the disciples had just put the Picture Slab on the muster station. The muster station was full of dust, but they didn't mind and were now around the Slab to see the direct broadcast of the competition.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the female disciples of Lady Peak had cleaned the hall and put pieces of cushions around the Picture Slab. They had also prepared many snacks, such as spiced nuts, green tea melon seeds, and so on to enjoy along with the fight. It was almost as if movie night was going on. All the disciples were sitting around the slab, gossiping and eating as they enjoyed the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Among them, Nina was leaning on a cushion and her eyes were closely following Zheng's figure. Sometimes, she would sit straight when Zheng's rivals were strong. Her only focus was Zheng and she had watched all his competitions.</p>

  <p>Some of her close friends knew clearly what was going on in her mind.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at the beginning, they had made jokes at her, "See! Our, oh sorry, HER dear Zheng wins again!"</p>

  <p>Even though Nina had pretended to be angry at the jokes, she had actually felt warm and happy and was blushing in her heart. The thinking of young girls was sometimes just simple and direct.</p>

  <p>However, with the rapid rise of Zheng's rank in the All Peaks Competition and his unexpected performance, he had attracted the attentions of the entire Cloud Sect, including most of the female disciples. Some special meanings had added themselves to their eyesight or rather, their gazes.</p>

  <p>Obviously, all the young ladies wanted to love and be loved. The meteoric rise meant that Zheng's status was constantly rising in the eyes of those female disciples.</p>

  <p>A character like Zheng was sure to have brilliant future!</p>

  <p>Because of this change, Nina's friends had stopped making jokes about Zheng and her and focused on the competition now.</p>

  <p>The world of martial artists might sometimes be very warm, but most of the time, its occupants were snobbish and realistic. Both Nina's appearance and family background could have been easily ranked as top level in the whole Eastern Region. Many people had adored her as an unreachable goddess. They had not even dared to dream of dating her simply because of the big gap between their normal life and this goddess' life.</p>

  <p>In that way, one could even consider Nina and Zheng the perfect match.</p>

  <p>One had a beautiful appearance and a notable family background, while the other was a gifted, brilliant, and talented disciple. However, since Zheng was not from a noble clan, it would have seemed that he was inferior to Nina.</p>

  <p>But with Zheng's good performance in the All Peaks Competition, the situation was changing.</p>

  <p>Zheng had showed some excellent talents so far, and he definitely would not stay in the Eastern Region forever. It was natural that he would seek for better opportunities out of the area and travel around, which would let him show off his strength in a bigger world. The Eastern Region was too small. At this moment, Zheng was easily qualified, or even exceeded the qualifications required to marry the princess of the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>With a similar thought tossing and turning in her mind, Nina was having mixed reactions to Zheng's outstanding performance. On one hand, she felt happy for Zheng. And on the other, she felt a loss in her heart.</p>

  <p>The first time she had seen Zheng, she had carefully maintained her sense of superiority and pride before Zheng, staying at a minimum distance. But this young man had grown rapidly. Such a fast growth rate had made her breathless and at the same time, made her feel that the distance between them was getting broader and broader.</p>

  <p>Deeply indulged in these complex feelings and thoughts, there was a little lapse in her concentration right in the middle of the competition and she lost track. When she regained her consciousness, she suddenly found that a beautiful girl was standing beside Zheng. She felt even more depressed now.</p>

  <p>'Who is that girl? How could she suddenly appear and why is she standing by Zheng?' Nina had many questions to ask, but it was obvious that none of the people around her could answer those.</p>

  <p>She was not the only one to have such inquiries.</p>

  <p>Actually, almost no one could understand what was going on and wanted to ask, 'Who on earth is that girl? How could she appear like a ghost out of nowhere without any sound and sign?'</p>

  <p>Even some saints who were present could not understand what had happened!</p>

  <p>"Sword spirit! A sword spirit with a body! Elder Xu, don't tell me that Zheng has just obtained this sword spirit! And don't say that this sword spirit is a newly formed one!" Kenneth murmured, with his eyes fixed upon the girl in the arena.</p>

  <p>Hearing the remarks from Kenneth, Elder Xu felt speechless and depressed. He didn't know what to say and therefore, did not respond directly. However, he also complained in his heart, 'What else can I tell you? Can't you see everything clearly by yourself? You also know that a swordsman needs to comprehend the sword intent completely before he can condense his sword spirit. And it normally takes years of time for the sword spirit to be condensed into a human shape. And only remarkably amazing swordsmen with extreme talents can do that after years of training. Some swordsmen in the past could not condense their sword spirits even though they have completely mastered the sword intent.'</p>

  <p>Apart from Elder Xu's arguments, one's destiny also played a big role.</p>
