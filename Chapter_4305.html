  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a glimmer of hope when they realized the light film was protecting them.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, they had all been grimly resigned to their death.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed all was not lost after all!</p>

  <p>"Is it Luo Zheng? Has he come to rescue us?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Each person in the group called out.</p>

  <p>There was no response from the voice they were expecting to hear.</p>

  <p>A mocking voice rang out instead.</p>

  <p>"Finally, you decided to appear," the downgrader taunted. "But you won't be able to change their fate. Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>A thin spike shot out from a purple light ball. The spike spun wildly, gathering momentum before stabbing at the pale yellow light film.</p>

  <p>The pale yellow light film was condensed from the Energy Transfer Extreme Form, which could easily isolate, transfer, and gather all kinds of energies. But it was vulnerable to piercing. The sharp spike entered the light film with only a slight twist.</p>

  <p>"Auntie, watch out!"</p>

  <p>As the spike headed toward Yan, Luo Nian threw his whole body in front of her, exposing his back so the spike would hit it instead.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The spike skewered Luo Nian's shoulder, baring his bones.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's face contorted in pain, but he remained in place, blocking Yan.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian!"</p>

  <p>Yan felt her heart drop. It was unbearable seeing Luo Nian suffer for her.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Despite her exhaustion, Yan once again used her Energy Shaft to try to control the purple spike.</p>

  <p>To her dismay, however, she found that she could not. She had been able to control the purple light balls before when they had been owner-less.</p>

  <p>But now, the purple spike was under the control of the downgrader. Yan's Energy Shaft couldn't wrest control at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian gritted his teeth and hissed as the spike continued to sear through his flesh, blood, bones, and his insides.</p>

  <p>The others could only despair at the sight. They were completely helpless.</p>

  <p>They knew if they came into contact with the Destruction Extreme Form, they would turn into ashes. Only Luo Nian's extremely strong physique could endure it.</p>

  <p>"This is your son, isn't it?</p>

  <p>Can you really bear to see him slowly melt away and die in agony?</p>

  <p>What kind of father are you?"</p>

  <p>The downgrader had no empathy, but he could read the memories of those gathered here and figure out Luo Zheng's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Green ripples started covering Luo Nian's body as the Life Extreme Form energy worked double-time to heal him even as he continued to endure grievous injury.</p>

  <p>The pale yellow light film started unraveling, its threads extending towards the rapidly spinning purple spike.</p>

  <p>The Energy Transfer Extreme Form merged with the Destruction Extreme Form, dulling the latter's power.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader's laughter echoed.</p>

  <p>He had been able to suppress Luo Zheng before. He just needed to do it again.</p>

  <p>Purr, purr, purr!</p>

  <p>Countless purple spikes shot out of the purple light balls, heading straight at the pale yellow light film from all directions.</p>

  <p>But before the spikes could penetrate the film, a blue light flashed.</p>

  <p>Those trapped were suddenly teleported away, from that cramped space in one moment to the Immortal Mansion in the next moment.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion, located in the core area, hadn't been affected by the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>Tianming, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yan, Hilario, as well as dozens of people including Lorena, Mike, Bromley and Rosie who had originally stayed in the divine land arrived at the same time by Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>"Why are we here?"</p>

  <p>"Yan! Why do you look so pale?"</p>

  <p>"Where is Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Most of the Ruin Graveyard had been eroded. The divine land was also in a dismal situation. The Troubled Creatures had slaughtered their way to invasion.</p>

  <p>Lorena, Rosie and the others had fled into the Evolutionary Universe to go into hiding, but they knew it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't be long before the Troubled Creatures invaded the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>As chaos erupted in the Immortal Mansion with the new arrivals, floating golden particles appeared in the center of the courtyard.</p>

  <p>The golden particles, resembling ears of wheat, melded together, forming a human figure.</p>

  <p>The golden light dissipated to reveal Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"It's really Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is alright! He is safe!"</p>

  <p>Those gathered here were obviously Luo Zheng's loved ones and those who cared about him the most. They had been beside themselves with worry for him.</p>

  <p>When the downgrader had occupied the entire Burial Land with the Probability Extreme Form, he had killed all of Luo Zheng's avatars scattered across the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Thus, the avatars Luo Zheng had created to accompany Yudie, Xi Youqin, and the others had suddenly dissolved into a pool of blood. Up until this moment, they really feared that Luo Zheng had been killed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not respond to the rush of friends and family around him. He fixed a steely gaze on the skies.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>One by one, the downgrader's avatars began to appear in the sky above the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>These were not illusions created by the Probability Extreme Form but genuine avatars.</p>

  <p>One thousand...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand...</p>

  <p>A million...</p>

  <p>A chill ran through those assembled below as the number of downgraders increased.</p>

  <p>"You really think your presence can change anything?" the downgrader said, sneering at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the downgrader with a faint smile. "Try me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng radiated so much confidence the downgrader was a little miffed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng must have realized by now that there was a huge discrepancy in the energies they used. There was no chance of him winning. How could he remain so calm? Had he gone insane?</p>

  <p>"Oh, quit bluffing!"</p>

  <p>As the downgrader spoke, he swung his fist.</p>

  <p>His over a million avatars likewise did the same. They all threw a punch at the same time.</p>

  <p>An invisible fluctuation spread through the space.</p>

  <p>The combined punches from the avatars were equivalent to a punch from the downgrader at maximum force. The impact would be enough to reduce the Immortal Mansion into fine rubble. There was no way Luo Zheng could survive it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, a fist print appeared over a hundred feet above the Immortal Mansion. An enchanted barrier that protected the Immortal Mansion came into view.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>Fist marks crowded the surface of the enchanted barrier as the punches landed like rain.</p>

  <p>A million punches had landed in only a few seconds, but they were all blocked by the enchanted barrier!</p>

  <p>"What's this?" the downgrader spat out, taken aback. "How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>In his opinion, Luo Zheng couldn't possibly bear a million punches, but now he did it right before his eyes!</p>

  <p>"Have I underestimated you?"</p>

  <p>It began to dawn on the downgrader then that the energy given by the ancestry-level bloodline must be much more powerful than he had imagined. He steeled himself and once again activated the Probability Extreme Form to launch another strike on the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Countless downgraders gathered around the Immortal Mansion in clouds created by the Probability Extreme Form. They all struck out their palms downward at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Ten billion strikes!"</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Over ten billion palm prints appeared on the enchanted barrier. The enchanted barrier trembled from the impact, but it remained intact.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>"A hundred billion strikes!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader kept stepping up his attacks, but the enchanted barrier of the Immortal Mansion continued to withstand it.</p>

  <p>After some time, the downgrader paused in silent thought. Something was amiss, and he had finally figured out what it was.</p>
