<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Studying the Champion Fish whose size was exceedingly bigger than before, all the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace lost their ability to speak.</p>

  <p>Never having encountered such a situation, they stood with their feet rooted to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I'll go kill him!"</p>

  <p>Milo blurted out abruptly, breaking the deathlike silence.</p>

  <p>Even though everyone knew they were caught in a trap carefully designed by the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, the fact that Milo had blindly facilitated their plan could not be denied.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming pressure and guilt weighing down on his shoulders kept him silent from the beginning. He only had one thing on his mind, and it was to kill those Champion Fish to redeem himself.</p>

  <p>Witnessing Seamus act more and more rashly, Milo could not just stand by and watch anymore.</p>

  <p>Seamus was the source of all problems. He was obviously the one who was controlling the altars and the Champion Fish like some puppeteer.</p>

  <p>Apart from destroying the altars and breaking the wall to escape, killing Seamus could be an alternative way. However, it would still pose a challenge due to him being guarded by several layers of Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>"Don't be impulsive, Milo! You'll jeopardize everything!"</p>

  <p>"Seamus must have taken all necessary preventive measures against us today!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Konnor and the others tried to calm him down by reasoning with him.</p>

  <p>But it was to no avail. Milo shook off all their pleas as he clenched his fists, a cold aura beginning to emit from his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Even though Milo was arrogant, he was still a levelheaded person. Ever since he went up the mountain, not once did he lose his cool over anything.</p>

  <p>But now, it seemed Seamus had stepped over his last nerve and driven him off the edge of sanity.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Milo's figure flashed at the speed of light as they all watched him charge towards Seamus without any hint of hesitation.</p>

  <p>"No! Milo, stop!"</p>

  <p>"He's heading to his death! Somebody stop him!"</p>

  <p>"Who can get him back?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace erupted in frustration as they all screamed in unison.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Milo was, there was no way he could survive the besiege laid by the countless Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Someone else was seen heading in the same direction as Milo from the crowd.</p>

  <p>While the person rushed forward, he left a series of purple flames behind from his steps!</p>

  <p>"Efrain?"</p>

  <p>"Efrain! What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Judging from his speed and determination, it did not seem like he went on a rescue mission to get Milo back. But, he was going to assist Milo in his attempt to kill Seamus!</p>

  <p>"Staying here is like inviting death to consume us all! Instead of waiting for our end, why don't we just fight for our lives?" That was all Efrain said to the disciples who tried to stop him.</p>

  <p>Those who were strong enough to stand out from others in the Oneness Sky Palace were by no means afraid of going face to face with death.</p>

  <p>Both Efrain and Milo had gone through their fair share of life and death situations. And neither of them shied away from making desperate decisions when faced with challenging circumstances!</p>

  <p>"I'll go too!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure began to flash as he prepared to charge towards Seamus as well.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, wait!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy shouted desperately from afar.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng hesitated to turn to look at her.</p>

  <p>"Please, be careful..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy was worried about him, but she didn't stop him. They would have a less chance of survival if both Milo and Efrain died. If they really wanted to kill Seamus today, their best bet would be to cooperate and launch their mightiest strike together.</p>

  <p id="top_25">Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Following their lead, another pair of warriors emerged from the crowd with determination. Both of them were Indigo Souls. They were outstanding warriors coming from the Ivory Mountain and the Bright Mountain, respectively.</p>

  <p>Seeing the five tenacious figures approach him with agility, Seamus put on a smug smile. "The desperate rabbits will bite. What a pity, they all seem to be courting death..."</p>

  <p>With a gentle gesture of his hand, he pointed at Milo, who was in the lead.</p>

  <p>In response to his command, the Champion Fish swarmed over towards Milo like a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>Each of these fish was quite tough. Ordinary means of attack just wouldn't suffice in tearing their scales apart, and there were thousands of them. One on top of the other, they forged a thick wall and made their way towards Milo.</p>

  <p>Milo's young face was full of coldness, and the aura of his Soul of Light became colder, which could even be sensed by people from some distance away.</p>

  <p>"Do you honestly believe that these things can stop me?"</p>

  <p>Milo turned over, and his Mind Sword responded to his growing rage. It began to swirl around him crazily in frantic movements, like a blade of a windmill.</p>

  <p>Biff, Biff, Biff, Biff...</p>

  <p>Every Champion Fish that came within a ten feet radius of Milo was brutally cut into pieces by his Mind Sword. He actually managed to power through the wall made of Champion Fish and charged towards Seamus.</p>

  <p>"Huh..."</p>

  <p>Seamus remained unfazed by this sight, he still had other moves up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>The army of Champion Fish he sent out at the beginning was small. He didn't pin his hopes on them to kill the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. But then, more Champion Fish of huge sizes came out of the altars and revealed themselves. Slowly, they stationed themselves behind Seamus as if they were the last layer of protection he had. These bigger ones were surely not easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>However, Seamus seemed to have overlooked one detail, and that was how fast Milo could move.</p>

  <p>Now in a state of sheer madness, Milo was out of control as he went all out to activate his soul force. It was as if his whole figure had morphed into a sharp blade, rushing to his target with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Efrain, Zheng, and the other two had broken through the wall of the Champion Fish and watched in shock at how fast Milo was advancing.</p>

  <p>"The speed of Milo... is amazing!"</p>

  <p>"How did he achieve that?"</p>

  <p>"He seems a little unnatural!"</p>

  <p>The warriors on the Other Shore did not use their eyes to see. Instead, they used their souls to perceive things.</p>

  <p>Milo's soul grew more and more ruthless with time. His aura was bone-chilling cold like that of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Not only did his increasing speed surpass the expectations of Zheng and Efrain, but Seamus was caught off guard as well.</p>

  <p>When Seamus regained his senses, Milo was already only a hundred feet away from him!</p>

  <p>Not knowing how to deal with the situation, Seamus remained dumbfounded with his eyes fixated on Milo. Fear began to seize him as he felt himself give up.</p>

  <p>He was not strong enough to go against Milo if they were up against each other in a fair fight. And now, Milo was going all out rampaging towards him. How could Seamus be willing to risk his life fighting Milo?</p>

  <p>The only logical plan spiraling in his mind now was to retreat!</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>However, he could never escape in time as Milo's speed far surpassed his.</p>

  <p>Soon, the distance between them had closed significantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Efrain, and the other two warriors quickly rushed over to watch the scene more closely. A glimmer of hope flashed through their hearts. 'Can he really do it? Can Milo kill Seamus and end it once and for all?' they started to wonder to themselves.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>Milo roared in aggravation as he unleashed a sharper aura than before. An invisible Mind Sword began to take its form in front of him.</p>

  <p>As the sword was about to kill Seamus, the ground beneath Milo's feet cracked open.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A vine full of sharp teeth extended from the open ground and wrapped itself around Milo, restraining him!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Seamus, who was retreating, stopped in his tracks and began to laugh viciously. "Surprised? Don't forget, I didn't come here alone!"</p>

  <p>This trap was carefully planned. It was a joint work from the elite disciples of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race. Seamus' job was only to control the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>"In remembrance to your bravery, I'll grant you a quick and painless death!"</p>

  <p>Seamus gloated while waving his hands gently once more.</p>

  <p>Upon his command, the huge Champion Fish gathered from all directions and charged at Milo with an intent to kill. In the blink of an eye, Milo was surrounded with no place to retreat.</p>

  <p>"No! Milo!"</p>

  <p>"No way! Milo!"</p>

  <p>"Somebody, please go save him!"</p>

  <p>The expressions of Efrain, Zheng, and the others switched immensely. If he fell into the mouth of these Champion Fish, his Soul of Light would be devoured within a split second. Milo might not be able to survive this.</p>
