<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man's actions were sudden, and everyone's faces changed drastically.</p>

  <p>However, there was also a small group of warriors who had a smirk on their faces. Like a comet, Luo Luo Zheng had risen quickly to prominence and had been in the limelight for a long time. But in the end, even he was defeated by someone.</p>

  <p>Yudie's expressions turned stern and her face became red with fury. She stomped her feet, and the pearl crown on her head swayed as she began to rush towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Imogen, Xander and the three fat alliance heads all had nervous expressions on their faces. They didn't know what was going to happen next.</p>

  <p>However, before anyone could react, time suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, when they had hatched the Ancestral Dragon Egg, the Celestial Position warriors had increased the time flow rate. This meant that every day inside the hatchery was just a few seconds. Time passed as quickly as sand running through one's fingers in there. One year had passed in the outside world, while inside that barrier, a thousand years passed.</p>

  <p>And now, in the Cloud Hall, time had become a thousand times slower.</p>

  <p>Everything was happening at a speed that was a thousandth of the outside world. People moved slower than a snail. In fact, it was safe to say they weren't moving at all. It was difficult for the naked eye to notice their movement.</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was the area that was affected. Time had almost come to a halt within a one-thousand-mile radius of the Cloud Hall. This was in stark contrast to the enchanted barrier, both in terms of direction and area.</p>

  <p>The birds in the sky stopped in midair, and the smoke leaving the chimneys solidified into a column that did not get dispersed. The ripples on the surface of the lake also remained the same. Of course this was only for the outside world.</p>

  <p>However, somehow, the Ancestral Dragon was unaffected by this change.</p>

  <p>"Gagoom?" the Ancestral Dragon cried. At its current age, its intelligence was the same as a human toddler's. Although it was not affected by the change in the time flow rate, it was curious about why Mu Ning had stopped moving.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as if by instinct, it seemed to sense something and flew out of the window, heading straight towards the Martial Arts Hall.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled and looked up at the sky before he left out a sigh,</p>

  <p>"Time waits for no one. Although your cultivation has advanced tremendously, resources in the Lower World are scarce. You're still too slow. Let me lend a helping hand."</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, the Ancestral Dragon flew in.</p>

  <p>"Gagoom...gagoom?" the beast called out anxiously when it saw Luo Luo Zheng lying on the ground with his eyes closed. Its hostility towards this old man was intense. Like any baby to its mother, it wanted revenge.</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled and told the Ancestral Dragon, "You puny thing."</p>

  <p>Instead of finishing his sentence, he ignored the Ancestral Dragon and walked towards Luo Luo Zheng. Extending his withered hand, he brought out a dark green medicinal pill.</p>

  <p>As soon as the pill was taken out, it flew toward the sky.</p>

  <p>"Only enlightened a little and you want to escape? I don't think so. No.</p>

  <p>In your dreams!" The old man's hand gently twirled and an invisible force somehow dragged the medicinal pill down.</p>

  <p>The weird thing was that the pill did not only seem to be conscious but also sentient. It looked capable of fighting since green halos suddenly appeared from within the pill. Those halos instantly condensed into a green bolt of lightning and tried to counterattack the old man.</p>

  <p>This old man seemed genuinely unhappy with this display. With a cold snort, he pointed his finger and the round pill broke into several tiny pieces which then turned into a green cloud and spread out.</p>

  <p>Following this, the green-colored cloud began to float motionlessly in the air above the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Down!" The old man let out a soft whisper. As if commanded by a master, the huge green cloud started to slowly swirl and then finally morphed into a small stream that began to flow into Luo Zheng's mouth.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Luo Luo Zheng had completely absorbed the green cloud. The old man then walked gracefully towards his seat and poured out a glass of fine wine for himself. Next, he blinked his eyes and time was restored to normal within an instant.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, who was midway in taking a step forward, immediately stabilized herself, but she still looked flustered.</p>

  <p>Although this old man had just slowed down time, it hadn't absolutely stopped. In fact, even if he wanted to completely stop time, he couldn't have done that no matter how hard he tried. There was a theory about the Time Law which postulated that any creature who cultivated the Time Law could only slow down or increase the time flow rate; they couldn't stop it.</p>

  <p>Thus, everyone was still able to see what was going on in front of them.</p>

  <p>Their minds could still think and their senses were still intact. By now they understood that this old man truly did not bear any enmity towards them.</p>

  <p>However, his practice and command of the Time Law had left everyone stunned.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, very few martial artists were proficient in Space Law, and cultivating the Time Law was far more difficult than cultivating the Space Law. As a result, until now, there hadn't been a single martial artist who was proficient in Time Law. Luo Luo Zheng was an exception, although he had never demonstrated his token in Time Law.</p>

  <p>However, this old man had changed the Cloud Hall's time flow rate with a few simple flicks of his eyelids. During that period, everyone and everything had almost come to a halt. This was a mysterious and powerful method at play. Everyone could sense that this old man was incredibly strong. In fact, the word "strong" was a bit of an understatement. His power was simply terrifying!</p>

  <p>The pill the old man had taken out was even harder to fathom. It had the consciousness to run away and was even able to attack the old man when forced to. At the same time, the old man had been completely unharmed by the display of thunder that had ensued. The green bolt of lightning from the pill was powerful enough to kill any mortal man. But the old man had been completely unaffected.</p>

  <p>So, undoubtedly, the pill was potent.</p>

  <p>Forgetting about all that, everyone was quite envious right now. Not of the old man, but of Luo Luo Zheng. He didn't seem to know this guy but the old man had still come all the way over here to give him a wedding gift. The warriors who had gloated at Luo Zheng's misfortune, and everyone else too, were now green with envy.</p>

  <p>"Sir, what did you do to Luo Luo Zheng?" Ning Yudie couldn't help but step forward and ask the old man.</p>

  <p>The old man lightly shook his head and casually replied, "I gave him a wedding gift, of course." When he finished speaking, he rolled his eyes and slapped his head. "Oh right, how silly of me! The groom got a wedding present, so the bride should have one too. But this wedding gift is a bit simple. I hope you won't mind."</p>

  <p>The old man patted his belly. But nothing happened. Then he muttered to himself, or rather to his own belly, "Now, now! Don't be greedy. I didn't put these divine weapons in there for you to use them. Even when you did use them, I never said anything about it, but do you really think they are yours to keep?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was looking at each other in astonishment. Was this guy crazy?</p>

  <p>'Why is this old man talking to his stomach? Is he a madman?'</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng stood up and asked with a smile on his face, "Are there experts in your inner world who possess and use divine weapons?"</p>

  <p>The old man rolled his eyes. "There's a guy inside my body. He's reached the cultivation base of Soul Sea Realm. He directly occupies all the space in my body and proclaims himself to be the sacred emperor. He even hid the one thousand divine weapons I had stored in my inner world. He thinks that they are his own. Silly him! Damn! Bring them out!"</p>

  <p>After that, the old man pointed his finger and a bright gold bracelet suddenly appeared out of nowhere and floated into his hands. The old man now laughed, "I came in a hurry and didn't have time to prepare something good. This bracelet is the only thing I thought was appropriate on this occasion. It's a bit too simple. I'm embarrassed to give you this.</p>

  <p>But it's a divine weapon after all, so I believe it will do the trick." The bracelet then floated towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"A divine weapon..."</p>

  <p>Shock appeared on everyone's face. Some of them couldn't even believe what they were seeing and hearing with their own senses. 'A divine weapon is too simple?</p>

  <p>That's a divine weapon for crying out loud!' Some people began to curse inwardly.</p>

  <p>The most powerful treasures in the Central Region were only some mid-grade sacred weapons, and even those were very few in number. People might have read about them in books, but the general public at least had never seen them in real life.</p>

  <p>And the old man had just said that as a present, the bracelet was too simple. It burned the other warriors up.</p>
