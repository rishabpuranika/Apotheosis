</p>

  <p>The Cloud Road was a trial where all new disciples had to test their art of refining. Moreover, it was also a path of opportunities.</p>

  <p>It was full of various challenges that the disciples must do their best to overcome. The whole process manifested their strengths and exposed their weaknesses. Additionally, whether some of the disciples would be lucky enough to find their opportunities or not would come to light.</p>

  <p>Some disciples might have the ingrain abilities to practice, but they might not have the chances to acquire the precious instruments on Cloud Road. Some of them might be lucky, but they might be incapable of seizing those kinds of opportunities.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Road was unlike the transmission array, as Luo Luo Zheng realized that the Cloud Road felt quite different, and nor did it resemble the Bloody Mountain of Cloud Sect since the Cloud Road wasn't a magic array made through some kind of skill.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he had just stepped into a door when he walked into the whirlpool. Suddenly the surroundings changed, much to his surprise.</p>

  <p>"Another world..." Tianming murmured. His curious eyes attentively looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>He saw a world that he had never seen or heard of. It was a world of decay and destruction.</p>

  <p>Before they had set out, Kenneth had told them about Cloud Road's situation in full detail.</p>

  <p>There were indeed some special places of mystery in the world, but they were unknown to ordinary people. These places of mystery didn't physically exist as they could only be accessed by people who achieved enlightenment in thinking. Luo Luo Zheng went into the Killing Sword Mountain only after he had grasped the essence of the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>Now, the Killing Sword Mountain did not belong to the world the naked eye could see. It belonged to another world, and so did the other places of mystery.</p>

  <p>This section of the road before them was actually a valuable place where an ancient sect practiced the refining arts many years ago, but it was now in ruins.</p>

  <p>The ancient sect might have declined and finally vanished thousands of years ago. Thus, the place had been forgotten and was left as a relic.</p>

  <p>Visitors from the outside world were rare. However, opportunity brought it to the hands of the Cloud Hall, and they sealed all the other entrances to this place except for the one where the transmission door was built.</p>

  <p>Since then, the Cloud Hall had always controlled this world of mystery and its possessions.</p>

  <p>However, all the precious instruments and heritage items in the relic were long gone before the Cloud Hall had taken over it. It seemed that they chose this place as one session of the Cloud Road because it was also where the ancient sect's disciples tested their refining techniques.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall took advantage of the place's former design and used it as its own testing site for the disciples of the grade-two sects led by the Cloud Hall and the Cloud Hall disciples.</p>

  <p>Anyone who passed the test would be viewed as an elite disciple of the Cloud Hall, and would be awarded and trained with their best resources.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! I'll wait both of you at the end of the Cloud Road!" Patrick grinned before stepping ahead towards the unknown world. Before them was a wide road which branched into numerous trails that led into different directions.</p>

  <p>Of course, Cloud Road was highly likely to be made of various roads and various possibilities. One's choice of road to take would definitely make a difference to the difficulties and challenges they would have to face.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming nodded and walked ahead as well.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng stayed instead of following his two companions. He was in a trance again.</p>

  <p>In a complete and intact world, it was impossible for one to perceive the world's edges no matter how far their eyes could see. The best view there would be was no further than the horizon that could be seen on top of the highest mountain in the world. And the view beyond it was unknown, as all the naked eye could see was sheer blurriness.</p>

  <p>But, the world Luo Luo Zheng saw was shattered. The sky was split into huge fragments with wide clefts between them. Some clefts had jagged shapes as if a wild dog had bitten them. Some had straight and narrow edges and spread far to the ends of the sky as if they were lines drawn by Mother Nature. Overall, the place painted a weird picture beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had become sensitive to the space ever since he had understood some rules of the space. Those irregular clefts were no more than entangled lines in the eyes of others, but they were beautiful as far as Luo Luo Zheng was concerned.</p>

  <p>What mighty and powerful force shattered the world into fragments?</p>

  <p>That kind of force was beyond Luo Zheng's imagination. He just stood on where he was, and meditated on the force that caused the place to be such a shocking scene. But of course, he knew that the time given to finish the Cloud Road was limited and the entrance would be closed if all the supreme life vitality had run out. However, he couldn't figure out the reasons behind the ruins.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Kenneth observed their actions outside the entrance of Cloud Road at the same time Luo Luo Zheng was in contemplation. He began to get worried.</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard for all the sect heads to observe the actions of each of their disciples through the Picture Slab. All the disciples had set out their journey on the Cloud Road, except for Luo Luo Zheng. He just stood by the entrance and blankly watched the sky. His weird behavior definitely caught the attention of every sect head.</p>

  <p>"What's the problem with Luo Luo Zheng?" Kenneth asked. He was fully aware of the kind of person Luo Luo Zheng was as well as the destiny he must face. Unlike Evan, Luo Luo Zheng was careful enough not to do anything irrational. But why had he stayed there for a long while since his entry to the Cloud Road, and refused to leave? 'Was there anything wrong? What happened?' Kenneth could not help but ask internally.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Eddy burst into laughter. "Wow, will it happen again, Kenneth? I still remember how Evan fell asleep on the Cloud Road three years ago! If I'm not wrong, he's a disciple from the Cloud Sect, right?"</p>
