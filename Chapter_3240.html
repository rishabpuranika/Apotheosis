<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3240 Destruction </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even the person who had brought them the message looked puzzled, unable to decipher the meaning of the message.</p>

  <p>Destroying the temple? Were they serious?</p>

  <p>It was widely known that it wasn't easy to build a temple at the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was as difficult as destroying one.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that someone belonging to the Taiyi Heaven Palace had really been able to destroy the temple of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>The heads of the mountains and many other masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace present were just as bewildered as he was.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand the rapid change in the attitude of the Bearing race as a whole. And what did they mean by begging them for pardon?</p>

  <p>"Who brought the message to you?" Qiu Yinhe asked.</p>

  <p>"The Fire Emissary of the Bearing race," the person replied.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Emissaries were the five famous warriors of the Bearing race who shared a high status in the great race.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean? Is he serious?"</p>

  <p>"Is someone really tearing down their temple?"</p>

  <p>"That's something I'd like to know too!"</p>

  <p>"There are many restrictions imposed on the temples. They can't be destroyed by ordinary people."</p>

  <p>The heads of the various mountains erupted into discussion, each one of them secretly happy about the development.</p>

  <p>This was because the Bearing race had earlier attempted to kill the elite disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Now that they were getting their retribution, it was a huge relief to the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe thought for a moment before turning to the messenger and saying,</p>

  <p>"This is our response to the Bearing race: we don't know who is tearing down their temple. We will conduct our own investigation before we give them another reply."</p>

  <p>"Yes, master!" the messenger said, bowing with respect. He then turned around and quickly exited the meeting hall.</p>

  <p>After Seamus's failure, the remainder of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had either left the Other Shore or retreated to their temples.</p>

  <p>They still thought their temples were safe places where they could hide in peace.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to take down a temple.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Li race had been defeated by the Bearing race in the war back then, they had escaped and gone into hiding. Only a small number of them had stayed on to guard their temple. Even so, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had continued to attack their temple for a long time before finally taking it down.</p>

  <p>And now, the Bearing race was full of powerful warriors. Once other races began to attack their temple, a large number of their own people would come there for aid. The number of restrictions on their temple meant that nobody could easily invade it.</p>

  <p>Just like the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, many members of the Bearing race also stood in front of the gates of their temple and watched on in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"How did Seamus fail?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't he say his plan was faultless?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows what happened inside the smoke wall. It seems that someone tore the wall with bare hands!"</p>

  <p>"How can there be such a powerful warrior in the Lust World? I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>While the members of the Bearing race watched and whispered among themselves, Luo Zheng and Dorothy made their way over to them.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was on full alert, walking at a much slower pace than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nobody would dare provoke him, especially since he had appeared here with his physical body. But Dorothy might face dangers since she was only an Indigo Soul. She was ready to leave the Other Shore at a moment's notice if any unfavorable situation were to arise.</p>

  <p>"Someone is coming at us!"</p>

  <p>"That guy in the front..."</p>

  <p>"He's not a soul! What's wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>Many members of the Bearing race still didn't know what was going on.</p>

  <p>But as they watched Luo Zheng walking aggressively towards them, many of them left the Other Shore for safety. Some of them hid deep within their temple, while a few remained at the entrance, waiting for Luo Zheng to reach them.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng was close enough, they brought their hands together in respect and politely began to ask him, "Friend, what business has brought you to our-"</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't heed them. He walked up to the wall and kicked a temple pillar.</p>

  <p>Four huge pillars supported the main entrance of the temple of the Bearing race. Each of them was ten feet wide and supremely strong. But Luo Zheng's kick broke half the pillar into pieces, causing rubble to fly in all directions. The members of the Bearing race present there ducked, scared of Luo Zheng's sudden violence.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng landed a kick on the next pillar, destroying it by sending a crack through the middle.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Don't you know that our race is the most-" a member of the Bearing race came forward bravely, his voice trembling with fear.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng couldn't be bothered with him. He merely turned around and kicked the third pillar.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had every reason to kill these crooked people in revenge, given the things that the Bearing race had done to the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. But he held himself back. . . .</p>

  <p>The four pillars of the temple broke apart under Luo Zheng's violent kicks, causing the top of the temple to collapse with crashing groans and thuds.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race left the Other Shore for fear of being buried under the rubble of their temple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rushed inside the temple after tearing down the entrance.</p>

  <p>But since he wasn't a member of the Bearing race, the moment he stepped inside, the restrictions imposed on the temple were immediately triggered by the invasion.</p>

  <p>Just a few feet from Luo Zheng, a dozen tiles on the ground suddenly flipped over, beams of white light shooting out of the devices hidden beneath them. The Soul Purifying Light!</p>

  <p>Most temples were equipped with such devices. Even an Indigo Soul would be eliminated without a trace on being hit by the Soul Purifying Light. Such was the terrible cost of trespassing into an unfamiliar temple, which was why no one was usually willing to invade a temple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body, though, was not afraid of the Soul Purifying Light.</p>

  <p>The bright light illuminated Luo Zheng's body, but caused no damage at him.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stood outside the temple and watched. She wouldn't enter it until Luo Zheng had destroyed all the restrictions inside the temple.</p>

  <p>With several snaps, Luo Zheng moved swiftly around the temple and destroyed the devices within the tiles.</p>

  <p>All the Soul Purifying Light vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>He then set his eyes on the pillars that supported the structure. Once he destroyed all of them, the entire temple would be reduced to rubble.</p>

  <p>A commotion erupted within the Bearing race as Luo Zheng destroyed the temple.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Emissaries were furious.</p>

  <p>"Water Emissary, this is all your fault! Your idea of killing the elites of the Taiyi Heaven Palace has brought us no benefits and is showing us this horrific day!"</p>

  <p>"And now they even dare destroy our temple. What a shame!"</p>

  <p>"Fire Emissary, did the Taiyi Heaven Palace respond to our plea?"</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary folded his hands before his companions and said, "I have received their reply. They have declared that they knew nothing about the temple-destroyer and that they would send people to investigate this matter."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! Don't believe a word of it!" Metal Emissary sneered disdainfully before continuing, "Tell them that if they don't stop tearing down our temple, we'll go and invade their base!"</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" Fire Emissary said, rolling his eyes at him. "Do you think the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace will believe that?"</p>

  <p>The conflict at the Stage Four of the Other Shore was quite a common one.</p>

  <p>Even if both sides were furious at their losses, they would restrain themselves in public and only seek retribution in secrecy. If the two great forces were to start a full-scale war, the whole world would be thrown into a state of chaos. Invading the Taiyi Heaven Palace would just be a joke.</p>

  <p>"But what should we do now?" Water Emissary asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>The temple at Stage Four was the first station for their warriors on the Other Shore. Even if they reached Stage Thirteen, they usually needed to return to the temple for one reason or the other. It would be a great loss to the Bearing race if their temple was completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>More importantly, there was a considerable amount of soul crystal stored in the temple. The soul crystal was left behind for the descendants of the race.</p>

  <p>But once their temple was destroyed, this important resource would fall into enemy hands.</p>
