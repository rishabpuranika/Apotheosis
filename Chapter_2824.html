<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2824 Attacked By Shadows </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The momentum of this place was almost palpable.</p>

  <p>Samuel turned deadly pale when he felt the force of the momentum and bore its pressure.</p>

  <p>He had endured his resentment for Nicholas for many years, right from the Floating Islands to the Abyss Demon Region, and even sacrificed his three children for it.</p>

  <p>Now, he finally found the opportunity to seek revenge in this void.</p>

  <p>Originally, he thought that he was invincible, so he didn't take Nicholas seriously. Instead, he regarded the woman as his biggest rival.</p>

  <p>But now it looked like all his schemes and plots were turning out to be extremely ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' power was beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, who was floating in the sky, just glanced at him but he could feel that the whole world was full of disdain for him.</p>

  <p>He had gone through great pains to be reincarnated and become a Holy Being again, but Nicholas never took him seriously.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the Eight Diagrams disk hovered in the void, Nicholas' eyes fell on Zheng again. He said, "Before Mike's death, he managed to cultivate such an outstanding son. Within a hundred years, you have reached the consummation of True God Realm and have the strength to kill Holy Beings. Although it's miraculous, I'm not surprised. This is not Mike's contribution, but Lorena's."</p>

  <p>Nicholas felt calmer after saying these words, but there was a trace of indescribable jealousy in his eyes.</p>

  <p>If there was any special woman in the divine land, it must be Lorena.</p>

  <p>Nicholas tried to cross the Sea of Truth and constantly communicated with the people in the Source World, so he had a general understanding of the structure and forces of the whole Source World. He was well aware about the importance of the Nine Li race in the Source World and Lorena's position in the race.</p>

  <p>Lorena was without a doubt an excellent woman, so he had never forced her to do anything. He always took good care of her.</p>

  <p>"But today, I will have to personally destroy this miracle," said Nicholas ruefully.</p>

  <p>He wanted to free Lorena from all the shackles and give her enough time to forget everything.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas raised his hand slightly and turned it over, and a black and white shadow spread out from behind of him.</p>

  <p>The shadow suddenly soared to 60, 000 feet, about the same height as Zheng's current huge body.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you became so gigantic, but I want to see who is more powerful."</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas uttered these words, he went straight to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Dark Light World Transformation was similar to the lands of Demi-holy Beings. But the Demi-holy Beings built their lands using all of their internal momentum, while the Dark Light World Transformation was built with the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At the moment, Nicholas was soaring rapidly. Even though there was a lot of distance to cover between him and Zheng, he had arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the huge shadow stretched out its fist and dashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was known to all that strength and physical body were Zheng's greatest allies. However, Nicholas chose to fight head on with strength. One could imagine just how confident he was of his own strength.</p>

  <p>Zheng blocked the shadow's punch with his strong arms.</p>

  <p>All he felt was a strong force coming from the punch of the shadow.</p>

  <p>The force did not emanate from Nicholas' strength source, but from this world. So it was unimaginably strong.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A layer of mysterious golden light glowed on Zheng's arms, and his huge body, which was larger than the mountains, retreated at a lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a sneer on Nicholas' face. He had planned to manipulate the shadow to chase Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, just as he took a step forward to proceed with his plan, something happened that made him narrow his eyes in confusion.</p>

  <p>The shadow's punch failed to wipe out the golden light that was emitting from Zheng's body. Instead, it entered the shadow and rapidly spread towards him.</p>

  <p>"Interesting!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas could also feel the overbearing power of this golden light.</p>

  <p>Previously, Murphy was badly injured by Zheng's punch because of the impact of the golden light. So now, Nicholas was cautious about it.</p>

  <p>He turned his hands slightly and a stream of Dark Light Torrent gushed towards the golden light.</p>

  <p>The golden light came from the Truth of Godly Way that Zheng had refined with his physical body, while the Dark Light Torrent from Nicholas was formed by the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos.</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>When the two collided, the golden light steadily gained the upper hand, and eroded the Dark Light Torrent completely.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was taken aback by this turn of events.</p>

  <p>It was now that he realized that he had underestimated Zheng. His body shrank and quickly extracted itself from the huge shadow, leaving the golden light in the shadow.</p>

  <p>The golden light enveloped the shadow from left to right and destroyed it in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Your strength is strong, but it's just so-so." Zheng who was not far away smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Zheng himself was shocked by the power of the golden light. He didn't know what kind of Truth of Godly Way was contained in the golden light. It was certainly more powerful than the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos.</p>

  <p>Nicholas snorted coldly and said, "You just destroyed a Dark and Light shadow. What if I summon more of it?"</p>

  <p>Saying that he raised his hand again.</p>

  <p>As the huge Eight Diagrams disk above everyone's head began to revolve, many large indistinct shadows began to appear around Zheng.</p>

  <p>The crowd was quite shocked when they saw this army of shadows appearing nonstop.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid each shadow's strength is even stronger than a Holy Being's!"</p>

  <p>"If Holy Nicholas had chosen to use this power earlier, my father wouldn't have died."</p>

  <p>"Humph, do you think such a powerful method comes without a price?"</p>

  <p>The survivors debated and discussed carefully in the distance.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng was not ready when a huge shadow appeared in front of him, so its enormous fist smashed his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng was thrown away by the blow as a golden light exploded.</p>

  <p>However, this light was produced from the collision and it remained within the body of the shadow, while the domineering golden light quickly tore the latter into pieces.</p>

  <p>Nicholas seemed unaffected by this.</p>

  <p>The hefty shadow was torn apart, but even more appeared in its place.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng finished dealing with the shadows in front of him, a punch from another shadow had already landed on his back, sides, waist and head...</p>

  <p>More than a dozen shadows were attacking him together at this point and Zheng was beaten black and blue.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the woman and Sword Chen exchanged a worried look. No matter how strong Zheng's body was, he would not be able to bear such a brutal attack if he was being beaten passively.</p>
