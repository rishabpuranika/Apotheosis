<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3559 The Images On The Slates </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Zheng didn't know what to do yet, he wandered in the white world for a while. Apart from the pillars, he was still unable to distinguish anything else.</p>

  <p>He felt helpless and eventually, he just sat on the smooth floor. "I don't think I need to worry about whether or not I would be bound to Stage Fourteen now. It's a problem for me to even leave here," he said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 both remained silent. They observed the place really carefully, but they couldn't even see the vague pillars. Thus, they couldn't offer any help to Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were a total of nineteen purified beings on the nineteen stages of the entire Desire World. Those purified beings rarely participated in the feuds among many great races, as they were either independent individuals or chose to live in a remote place and protect their own races, not paying any attention to the affairs that happened in the world. Now, even though the Regal Jade Civilization had once been one of the ten great civilizations, they still didn't know much about the purified beings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the Dark Region, Feng Ge took care of Yan and Natalie so none of the creatures in the area would dare provoke or attack them.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the stage ruler's abnormal behavior had already caused a great uproar in the Dark Region. As a result, those creatures that hid in the Dark Region risked their lives and sent their forces to investigate the stage ruler's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>However, they were extremely shocked to find out that the stage ruler was dead when they saw his corpse lying prostrate from afar.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Dark Region naturally wanted to attack Feng Ge, but when they saw her activate the Great Sanskrit Light, they didn't even dare approach her anymore.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he simply sat quietly in the vast, white world.</p>

  <p>Since the Regal Jade Spirit said that this was the Land of Inheritance, there must be a method to inherit the title of the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>He gently waved his hand in the air, but didn't feel anything unusual. The Great Sanskrit Light should also be a kind of energy, and based on the light the giant lizard had unleashed before, the method of using such energy should also have different levels. Feng Ge, however, couldn't release that level of light wave like the lizard did.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the process of Feng Ge becoming a purified being was also quite strange. She did not enter this Land of Inheritance, and the one who had gone in instead was that pig-faced monster called "Teague". But just as Teague had become a purified being and was about to come out, he merged with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"If that pig-faced monster can make it, then I can make it too. Since the Great Sanskrit Light is a kind of energy, there must be a way to control it..."</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Zheng sat cross legged and meditated.</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed...</p>

  <p>An hour had passed...</p>

  <p>Two hours had passed...</p>

  <p>The white colored world was still as snow-white as ever, and it couldn't be touched, nor anything could be seen through within it.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Zheng didn't feel anxious in the slightest as he calmly stared at the white scenery in front of him.</p>

  <p>After he had stared quietly in the same position for six hours, he finally found something different. The white seemed to have moved, like the way the clouds in the sky rolled subtly.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What happened? The white moved?" he muttered, his brows arched up.</p>

  <p>A smile tugged at the corner of his lips. He turned to look at the pillars again, and the outline of the pillars became more distinct!</p>

  <p>"I'll continue to observe!"</p>

  <p>Another four hours had passed, and the number of times the white changed had increased.</p>

  <p>The white light was no longer a motionless scene, and instead it continued to roll. As it did so, Zheng also noticed that there were some shiny dots within the white light, which he didn't see before.</p>

  <p>Those light dots slowly floated around like aimless insects.</p>

  <p>"Does the key point lie in these light dots?" he mumbled.</p>

  <p>As soon as the thought came to his mind, he stood up and walked towards them. The second he stepped forward, however, the aura in the entire space became chaotic. All the light dots fluctuated with the change of the aura and quickly escaped from his side.</p>

  <p>"These light dots are almost weightless. A slight fluctuation of energy will make them float..." He thought for a bit again, then summoned the Wing King's feather.</p>

  <p>When he moved once more, the feather reduced the impact on the surrounding space by a huge amount. Just to be on the safe side, he even used the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh…"</p>

  <p>The light dots still slightly fluctuated when he approached them again, but the fluctuation was minor. At the very least, it was manageable.</p>

  <p>He walked straight towards the light dots and tried to make them meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>When the light spots merged with his pupils, he suddenly felt that everything around him had become clearer.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I was right..."</p>

  <p>It turned out that if one wanted to see the world clearly, they had to integrate those light dots into their eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had remained motionless since he entered this world. A lot of light spots accidentally entered into his eyes, which naturally made him see more and more clearly.</p>

  <p>However, the process was too slow. After all, the absorption of the light dots was purely based on luck.</p>

  <p>Now that he had found how everything worked, how could he still hold back?</p>

  <p>In the next second, he briskly walked forward and continued to absorb the light dots.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, he had already absorbed a hundred light spots into his eyes. The rolling white clouds and fog from before slowly dimmed, and the outline of the surroundings became clearer and clearer. Only then did he realize that he was standing in a white palace.</p>

  <p>On the left side of the palace stood many huge pillars, and in the center of the pillars were white slates. There were abstract images drawn on the slates. Although the images were abstract, he still could distinguish them.</p>

  <p>"This is a jellyfish?"</p>

  <p>"This is a wolf..."</p>

  <p>"This is a giant lizard. Is it that stage ruler?"</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed as soon as he saw the image of the giant lizard, as if he had understood something.</p>

  <p>He swept past the images on the slates while he counted them. "There are a total of twenty slates here. Are there twenty purified beings in the entire Desire World?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No, there are only nineteen stages in the Desire World. Theoretically, there are nineteen purified beings," the Regal Jade Spirit told him.</p>

  <p>Although the Regal Jade Spirit couldn't see those images, he could understand something from Zheng's mumblings. "But don't forget that there appeared a purified being in the Lust World all of a sudden," he added.</p>

  <p>There was originally no purified being in the first thirteen stages, and Feng Ge was the first one.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the Regal Jade Spirit's reminder, Zheng looked up and saw a strange pig-faced monster drawn on the slate on the top. However, that image of the strange pig-faced monster was a little special. There was a woman's head on his fat pig body.</p>

  <p>Of course, he couldn't help but laugh when he saw it.</p>

  <p>Something wrong had happened when the pig-faced monster occupied Feng Ge's soul, so it affected the Land of Inheritance. That was why it had shown such a mixed image.</p>

  <p>After all, the purified being was originally a pig-faced monster, while Feng Ge was just an occupant. He wondered what Feng Ge would think if she saw this image.</p>

  <p>Once he had scanned all the "portraits" of the purified beings, he looked at the other side of the palace. His usual expression suddenly turned into surprise.</p>

  <p>On the other side was a huge slate with densely packed Sanskrit words drawn on it.</p>

  <p>There were so many Sanskrit words, to the point that the number had far exceeded anything that Zheng had seen before!</p>
