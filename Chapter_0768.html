  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng knew his strength and limitations full well.</p>

  <p>No person in the Central Region could ever hope to outclass him when it came to the mastery of runes. The divine texture, which was passed down from the Upper World, was definitely something that the runes in the Central Region wouldn't be able to measure up to.</p>

  <p>That was just in regards to rune mastery, but in terms of overall strength, in front of all these elders who had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and Imogen and Eddie who were both currently in the Life and Death Realm, he was nothing but an ant in the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>If a war were to break out between the Life and Death Realm masters, even the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm wouldn't be strong enough and they would end up being eliminated right at the start like lambs to the slaughter. It might just be that only Yudie had the possibility of lending Imogen a hand in the fight to come. In the end, Zheng wouldn't even suffice as cannon fodder as well.</p>

  <p>That was to say, it wouldn't really make much sense for Zheng to put up resistance at all.</p>

  <p>The stream of energy between heaven and earth ceaselessly surged into Eddie's robust and towering physique. At that point in time, Eddie appeared as though he had transformed into an enormous mountain. The eyes of that mountain-like man glimmered, and he proceeded to throw a punch up into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Smash it into smithereens!"</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Crackle!</p>

  <p>From Zheng's perspective, Eddie looked like he was so twisted. The space above him was about to be totally ruptured by the immense force of just this single punch!</p>

  <p>As it ravenously stormed straight toward Zheng, his fist emitted a great amount of blinding light. It seemed apparent that the light contained exceptionally aggressive power!</p>

  <p>"Is this the so-called power that has the capability of obliterating everything?"</p>

  <p>As his eyes frantically flashed, Zheng concentrated his gaze on the radiant light that was about to hit him.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, the streaks of light had instantly turned up in front of Zheng, crashing into the enchanted barrier he had put up which was just less than three feet away from him.</p>

  <p>During that exact moment, Zheng truly felt like he was close to choking up.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Making it seem as though millions of explosives had detonated simultaneously, the impact produced an ear-splitting noise!</p>

  <p>The heavy punch brought about intense gusts of wind, and a countless number of wind blades went hurtling in all directions. A couple of those wind blades got deflected back over to Eddie, but he didn't even bother avoiding them at all. The wind blades might have managed to tear Eddie's robe into pieces, but they weren't that strong for him to get wounded.</p>

  <p>Even the mere repercussions of this powerful punch could be more than enough to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>That being said, Zheng did not receive any damage whatsoever. The Light of Water continuously defended him against all of Eddie's power.</p>

  <p>In order to withstand the heavy impact of the punch Eddie had thrown, large waves materialized on the surface of the Light of Water enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The waves scattered and rippled from the fist's point of impact. And eventually, the entire surface of the enchanted barrier successfully absorbed the impact from his attack. It was only after that point that the enchanted barrier then gradually went back to its original tranquil state.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the Cloud Hall, the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who were anxiously watching everything that had just transpired had their eyes all gleaming with anticipation.</p>

  <p>Yudie then heaved a heavy sigh of relief, squinting her eyes until they had the shape of tiny crescent moons. From what had just happened, she thought that pinning her hopes on Zheng was a good choice.</p>

  <p>Even then, Imogen still retained the face of a young maiden, and the look she had on her face never shifted at all.</p>

  <p>In spite of that, every other person from the Cloud Hall was thinking to themselves.</p>

  <p>The worth of the sect-protecting array, which was sturdy enough to hinder the attack of even the strongest master of the Central Region, was immeasurable.</p>

  <p>Were they to be given a choice between a Life and Death Realm warrior and the sect-protecting array that had been constructed by Zheng, be it the Cloud Hall or the Ethereal Spirit Sect itself, it was safe to say that they would most probably choose this array!</p>

  <p>The reasoning was quite easy to understand. You could say for a fact that a Life and Death Realm warrior could potentially aid a sect to reach the summit, but every single warrior's lifespan had its limitations, and needless to say, the Life and Death Realm warriors were not exempted from this.</p>

  <p>Even though they could walk the earth for about one or two millennia, Life and Death Realm warriors still had no way to escape death.</p>

  <p>Numerous bones could be found in front of the door of longevity. In the vast and endless universe, there were lots of beings who had quite long life spans, but none of them could possibly live forever.</p>

  <p>But despite that, sect-protecting array was a bit of an exception. For as long as it would be well taken care of, it had what it took to be able to last forever. It could protect a sect up until the end of time. And at some point, a super talent would be produced in the sect!</p>

  <p>That being the case, not only did Yudie not lose anything wagering it all on Zheng, she actually even ended up making a giant killing!</p>

  <p>Never in Eddie's wildest dreams would he have ever imagined that the strike in which he had put everything he had got still wouldn't be powerful enough to break the enchanted barrier Zheng had created. For this very reason, Eddie had been left completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Having years of experience fighting in the Central Region, nothing had ever surprised him to this extent.</p>

  <p>The only person who was aware of just how powerful that punch was supposed to be was Eddie himself!</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, this thin sheet which bore semblance to that of bubbles somehow succeeded in blocking the light released from his fist. The actual strength of that mysterious enchanted barrier was utterly beyond Eddie.</p>

  <p>What was even more irritating was that Zheng seemed to have had so much confidence in this enchanted barrier he had built. After all, he actually had the audacity to stand in a position that was just about two feet behind the barrier, staying straight-faced just like a dead fish, as if to tell him, 'Do you honestly think you can touch me?!'</p>

  <p>How many years had it been since anyone had the guts to mock him in that way? It had been so long that Eddie couldn't even remember anymore.</p>
