<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3335 The Blood Essence Godly Way </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In fact, it was possible for creatures in upper stages on the Other Shore to enter lower stages.</p>

  <p>However, they had to pay a high price for this and their strength would be limited by the rules of the stages.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization was superior to many other civilizations.</p>

  <p>Naturally, its members were by no means weak.</p>

  <p>If its members were allowed to use their powers untethered, Luo Zheng wouldn't stand a chance. Just the power of a Regal Jade Bug alone could kill Luo Zheng instantly without using any poison.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth. He felt the chains straining.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought he would make it, he suddenly heard a loud crack. One of the chains had snapped!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just as the first chain broke, the others followed suit. In the blink of an eye, eight chains had snapped.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knitted his brows in frustration. Previously, it had been extremely smooth for him to merge with the Eye of Will and the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that merging with the Civilization Artifact would have any hitches.</p>

  <p>Once the chains broke, the Sanskrit words on the other side dimmed slightly.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>"Your Thousand Sanskrit Land is not solid enough," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>"What? It's not solid enough?" Luo Zheng echoed in shock.</p>

  <p>He remembered that ever since he built the Thousand Sanskrit Land, almost everyone who encountered it had thought it was solid.</p>

  <p>If his Thousand Sanskrit Land wasn't solid enough, the ones built by the people with the same cultivation base as him might even be worse.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you," the Regal Jade Spirit said graciously.</p>

  <p>It used to be the Son of Truth. Moreover, the Civilization Artifact itself was very special and needed to be handled with care.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng managed to successfully merge with it, he wouldn't be able to control it fully. The Regal Jade Spirit was bound to the Civilization Artifact, and could also control it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact floating in the air suddenly flashed a cyan light. In a flash, the light transformed into cyan chains. The chains coiled around the Civilization Artifact and then extended to the edge of Luo Zheng's inner world, effectively merging with the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The golden chains created by Sanskrit words continued to snap, one by one.</p>

  <p>However, each time one broke, a cyan one would replace it.</p>

  <p>After replacing around 40 chains, the Civilization Artifact finally stabilized in Luo Zheng's inner world. With that, Luo Zheng had successfully merged with the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he could easily read the information hidden within the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>He understood its writing, background and development.</p>

  <p>He had caught a glimpse into the Regal Jade Civilization previously. The Regal Jade Spirit had activated the artifact to show him back in the Dark Region. But now, Luo Zheng seemed to grasp a full understanding of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng finished reading the information, he sensed a strange energy within the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>The energy was as red as blood. It floated in the air, forming a huge and unfamiliar red Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"What is this Sanskrit word?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"This is an unknown Sanskrit word," the Regal Jade Spirit replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows. "What do you mean? What's it for then?"</p>

  <p>Some Sanskrit words contained important information, such as the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. On the other hand, some were meaningless with no significance at all.</p>

  <p>But why did the Regal Jade Spirit summon this Sanskrit word?</p>

  <p>Moreover, the energy contained in this Sanskrit word made Luo Zheng feel even more uneasy.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to understand this Sanskrit word," the Regal Jade Spirit replied. "It was like this when the Wing King found it. You only need its energy, anyway. It is one of the flaws of the Divine Dao Great Unity. It's also a Godly Way, separate from the 3, 000 ones in the chaos."</p>

  <p>"A Godly Way separate from the 3, 000 ones?" Luo Zheng echoed, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>3, 000 was not always the exact number. Different masters had different ways of summarizing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The 3, 000 Divine Dao included all the energy in the chaos apart from the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>They included the flowers, trees, birds, beasts, the heaven, the earth, the sun, the moon and the Five Elements.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware of this. However, the Regal Jade Spirit was telling him that there was a new Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"This is truly unbelievable,"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 said uneasily.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Luo Zheng had merged with the Eye of Will and the Strength God Totem, No. 9527 was completely disinterested.</p>

  <p>However, now, it was extremely intrigued by the Civilization Artifact. After all, the Regal Jade Spirit used to be as strong as No. 9527's master.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had been quietly observing from the depths within Luo Zheng's mind. It could no longer conceal its shock at what was unfolding before them.</p>

  <p>It was even inclined to believe that its master would be shocked, too, if he were here to see what they were seeing.</p>

  <p>This demonic red energy was nowhere to be found whenever the chaos was born and destroyed time and time again. It was no wonder the Divine Dao Great Unity hadn't been realized.</p>

  <p>"What is this mysterious energy called?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Regal Jade Civilization doesn't have the concept of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Correspondingly, we have two thousand and eight hundred Essence Powers.</p>

  <p>This blood red energy is called the Blood Essence Power," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>"If that's so, can I call it the Blood Essence Godly Way?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Whatever," the Regal Jade Spirit replied disinterestedly.</p>

  <p>The name itself didn't matter. What mattered was the meaning hidden behind the name.</p>

  <p>The Blood Essence Godly Way was now one of the Divine Dao. It might not be powerful, because like the other Divine Dao, it couldn't compare to Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>However, it made up for a flaw; in doing so, the 3, 000 Divine Dao were a step closer to perfection.</p>

  <p>"You said that the Divine Dao Great Unity has three flaws, and the Blood Essence Godly Way is one of them. Are the other two flaws also Divine Dao?" Luo Zheng guessed.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit just smiled. "If it were that simple, the Divine Dao Great Unity would have been perfected a long time ago. Although I don't know what the other two flaws are, they most probably aren't Essence Powers, or what you'd call, Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips, realizing his mistake.</p>

  <p>The members of the Regal Jade Civilization had done everything in their power to try to find the other two flaws. How could he have been so bold to think he could figure it out on his own?</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, another thought crossed Luo Zheng's mind. "What kind of Other Shore Token is the Civilization Artifact? The descending type?</p>

  <p>The strengthening type? Or the mysterious type?"</p>

  <p>Realizing the Regal Jade Spirit's evident confusion, Luo Zheng briefly explained the types. Finally, the Regal Jade Spirit replied, "The Civilization Artifact has all the qualities you just listed. Here, I will teach you how to use it."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Luo Zheng and the Regal Jade Spirit talked, Geoffrey was standing on top of a palace, his gaze turned towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The moment the Civilization Artifact appeared in Luo Zheng's inner world, Geoffrey knew that his father brought back something strange.</p>

  <p>After the chains disappeared, the huge blood red Sanskrit word appearing in the sky immediately caught Geoffrey's attention. With curiosity, he studied it, trying to figure out the meaning of this mysterious Sanskrit word.</p>
