  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and followed Giacomo in silence.</p>

  <p>He had felt a strange sensation in his body while absorbing the blood wild bone, as if something in his body was going to come into being.</p>

  <p>Although this feeling was fleeting and felt like background noise to him, it still existed. He wondered what it meant.</p>

  <p>Romeo was a member of Nine Li race. After activating his form of Wild God, he came to possess two heads and four hands. It was the Blood Wild Body of Nine Li race. Luo Zheng wondered if his own Wild God too would have two heads and four hands, now that he had absorbed enough blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>Some time passed as they flew over, and Luo Zheng realized that Giacomo had taken him back to Herren City.</p>

  <p>Herren City was large and had a huge number of guards. When Luo Zheng had come here for the first time, he had been cautious and alert, not daring to cross the guards in the slightest. He had no reason to invite trouble for himself.</p>

  <p>Giacomo flew into Herren City with Luo Zheng behind him. Immediately as they entered, seven or eight streaks of light flew toward them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked them up and down. These people, he assumed, were high-ranking figures of the city. Although they did not have the blood of the Nine Li race, their cultivation bases seemed very high to him.</p>

  <p>"Master Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>"Master Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>They cupped their hands in unison and greeted Giacomo respectfully.</p>

  <p>Herren City was under the management of Star Sect, a sect associated with Nine Li race. Giacomo was respected by the warriors of the race, and so naturally these people showed him deference.</p>

  <p>Although they were utterly respectful toward Giacomo, their gazes fell on Luo Zheng from time to time.</p>

  <p>Giacomo wanted to use the transmission array in Herren City, saying he had an urgent matter to deal with. The people assumed that it had something to do with the man behind him.</p>

  <p>"Is the transmission array ready?" Giacomo asked them impatiently.</p>

  <p>The leader of the group nodded. "Yes, it is. Please come this way, Master Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>"Take me there," said Giacomo.</p>

  <p>The leader waved his hand and the rest of the company retreated. He led the way and the three of them flew to the west of the city.</p>

  <p>In a giant square in the west of the city, a huge transmission array had already been activated. It appeared like a delicate lotus leaf, slowly turning, a halo of soft pink light encircling it.</p>

  <p>After landing from the skies, Giacomo and Luo Zheng walked straight to this very exquisite transmission array.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the transmission array rotated, the soft light immediately blanketed Luo Zheng and Giacomo, taking them along its movement.</p>

  <p>The scene before Luo Zheng seemed to waver before his eyes as they made the journey. At this moment, his speed had increased by a million, even ten million times. They had traveled a long distance in a relatively short time.</p>

  <p>The principles of this particular transmission array were obviously different from those of the other arrays Luo Zheng had encountered before.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, a jade white wall appeared in front of Luo Zheng. It stood like a beast before him, blocking his way.</p>

  <p>The wall was so high that Luo Zheng could not see where it ended.</p>

  <p>"This wall is huge!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a little stunned, but then soon realized that it was a bone tower.</p>

  <p>This huge beast bone was about the same height as the divine land, perhaps a hundred trillion miles high. Although the beast bone was thin, the wall's width could have been a few trillion miles wide.</p>

  <p>Now that he was standing right below the bone tower, in comparison he must be even smaller than the smallest of dust particles, which was why he could not see the top of the tower. It seemed to have disappeared among the clouds.</p>

  <p>Staring at the giant bone tower, Luo Zheng was struck dumb for several moments.</p>

  <p>"This is the Sky Spirit Bone Tower belonging to our Nine Li race." There was a prominent hint of pride in Giacomo's voice as he uttered these words.</p>

  <p>Those able to occupy a bone tower were considered to be among the greatest races of this world.</p>

  <p>Even if some races possessed special blood, they were likely to share a bone tower with the other races. In comparison, this Sky Spirit Bone Tower was the sole belonging of Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"I heard that these bone towers belong to the body of a Chaos Ancient God. How powerful was this Chaos Ancient God prior to his death?" Luo Zheng asked, finally recovering from his shock.</p>

  <p>Given the enormous body of the Chaos Ancient God, he could have crushed the divine land with his giant feet in one go.</p>

  <p>"That's not something we have given much thought to," Giacomo said lightly, glancing at Luo Zheng in surprise.</p>

  <p>Many people knew that the bone towers had been the corpse of a Chaos Ancient God, but only a handful of them were curious about just how powerful the Chaos Ancient God was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in reply. Slowly, he stepped forward and entered the Sky Spirit Bone Tower along with Giacomo.</p>

  <p>Beneath the Sky Spirit Bone Tower was an enormous crack ten million feet high. As Luo Zheng walked into the crack at the bottom of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, he was suddenly bound by a strange aura.</p>

  <p>Covered by this aura, Luo Zheng felt a strange despondence settle in him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he heard a peculiar scream.</p>

  <p>The voice seemed to be purring something to Luo Zheng and constantly shuttling around his ears. But when he listened carefully, he heard nothing. It was when he paid no heed to it that the voice sounded again.</p>

  <p>It seemed to come from the depths of his soul. The whole experience was baffling.</p>

  <p>Giacomo noticed the change in Luo Zheng's expression and said, "Although the Chaos Ancient God is dead, his will is not going to dissipate anytime soon. Perhaps it will linger here for eternity. You will get used to it after a while."</p>

  <p>Even if a True God died, the power of their physical body lasted for a long time. And the Chaos Ancient God was in a different league altogether.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood this, but he had another question. "Everyone in this world absorbs the power of the wild bones. Can the power in the Chaos Ancient God's bones be absorbed as well?"</p>

  <p>Giacomo let out a hoot of laughter as he heard Luo Zheng's question. "Ha-h!</p>

  <p>Good idea. I'm afraid I will be invincible in this world if I absorb the Wild God Power of the bone towers. But it's a thought. Don't underestimate the Wild God Power of the bone towers! Even if you wield all your strength, you won't be able to destroy them the slightest bit. Even the most powerful warriors in Nine Li race fall flat."</p>

  <p>These people had lived in the bone tower for a number of years, so this idea must have occurred to them as well.</p>

  <p>For so many years, no one had been able to damage the bone tower in the slightest, not even create a crack on it.</p>

  <p>Still, there were a few giant cracks in the bone tower. The Nine Li people lived inside these cracks, but they were not the ones to create them.</p>

  <p>These had existed from a long time ago.</p>

  <p>It was speculated that the Chaos Ancient God had been seriously injured before he fell into this world, so the mottled cracks in the bone tower must have been left behind at that time.</p>

  <p>If the corpse of the Chaos Ancient God was intact and devoid of cracks in his bones, then no one in this world could have hidden inside the bone towers.</p>

  <p>It was a fact.</p>

  <p>For instance, there was no crack in the Heavenly Wild Bone Tower, and no one had been able to dig out a crack in it either. No race was able to step in the Heavenly Wild Bone Tower. It was a worthless endeavor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Giacomo flew in the air through the crack and the space ahead suddenly narrowed. It was so tapered that only one person could pass through.</p>

  <p>However, after a period of time, the space widened again. What appeared in front of Luo Zheng was an area spanning three large cities. Several buildings occupied the space and many of the Wild Gods were hurriedly shuttling through it.</p>

  <p>"Have we arrived?" Luo Zheng asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Giacomo shook his head. "This is where the three affiliated sects of Nine Li race live. Our race resides at the top."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the ceiling in the air. A wide crack could be seen above their heads. On the other side were a flight of steps that extended to a higher place.</p>

  <p>The bone was extraordinarily firm. No one was able to carve the steps out, so they had to be built out of other materials.</p>
