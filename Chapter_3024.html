  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3024 Good News </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy was slightly startled, and put a stop to all distracting thoughts.</p>

  <p>Then, just as she had calmed down, her Truth Boat abruptly tilted to one side.</p>

  <p>A Truth Boat tilting on the Sea of Truth was one of the most terrifying things to witness. If one failed to cast the Illusion Breaking Rune in time, they would fall overboard into the sea and die.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy's Truth Boat leaned sideways, however, the hull of her boat bumped into Luo Zheng's boat's stern. Shoving her boat with it, he forced it into its original position.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Dorothy said sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"The second line is coming soon. Stay focused," Luo Zheng reminded her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled and returned to focusing on steering the Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>Making it to the first line was difficult, and making it to the second was even more testing.</p>

  <p>Having broken through the first line, Luo Zheng was experienced now. The power of his Soul of Light also far exceeded that of any consummate True God. In theory, breaking through the second line shouldn't be too challenging for him.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's condition was similar to Luo Zheng's, even though her Soul of Light was weaker than his. However, she had the advantage of the Necklace of Mystic Soul, which would more than make up for this handicap.</p>

  <p>If she were to fully activate the Necklace of Mystic Soul, even Luo Zheng's power would pale in comparison to hers.</p>

  <p>The first three lines were easy for a personal disciple of a large clan like Dorothy.</p>

  <p>In order to speed up their progress through the second line, Luo Zheng used two soul pills, whereas Dorothy used five.</p>

  <p>Having passed through the second line, Luo Zheng still felt like he hadn't been fast enough. Considering their time limit, it would be ideal if he could cross the third line in a single breath.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng was about to act, No. 9527 spoke up. "Luo Zheng, someone is very close to your cultivation room."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had set up an enchanted barrier in his cultivation room to prevent others from spying on him. In addition, No. 9527 would also help him monitor his surroundings. It would not bother him if someone was just passing by his room.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and told Dorothy that he needed to leave the Sea of Truth now.</p>

  <p>Dorothy noticed the change in Luo Zheng's expression. Just as she was about to ask him what trouble he had encountered, he and his boat disappeared into thin air, right before her eyes.</p>

  <p>She shook her head disapprovingly. Then, closing her eyes and using the Illusion Breaking Rune, she left the Sea of Truth as well.</p>

  <p>Opening her eyes, she found Felicity sitting in front of her.</p>

  <p>Felicity looked at Dorothy with keen eyes. Her face was filled with worry.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Felicity, all I asked was for you to guard the palace for me. I didn't want you to be so nervous," Dorothy said, not knowing whether to cry or laugh.</p>

  <p>Felicity did not relax. "Did you see him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded and smiled. "Not only did I meet him, but we also encountered a major impediment!" she said, trying to keep her tone light.</p>

  <p>"What impediment?" Felicity asked in a high-pitched voice.</p>

  <p>Anything related to one's soul was a big deal. No matter where it happened, on the Sea of Truth or on the Other Shore, the significance of such events could not be overestimated. Felicity's expression suddenly shifted when she heard Dorothy's answer.</p>

  <p>"A huge whirlpool appeared before we could reach the second line,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>"What? Dora, are you trapped in the whirlpool? Or someone else?" Felicity was obviously frightened out of her mind.</p>

  <p>Her nephew, Evaristus, had tragically fallen into a similar whirlpool a few years ago. It had devastated his whole family.</p>

  <p>Despite using every method known to them, they had been unable to rescue poor Evaristus from the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Felicity's sister was inconsolable in her grief and frustration. She cried almost every day thinking about him. As for Evaristus, he was perpetually depressed and drowned his sorrows in alcohol. If there was indeed no way to save him from the whirlpool, he would have no choice but to reincarnate.</p>

  <p>Reincarnation, however, was a last resort.</p>

  <p>What a great misfortune to their clan would it be if Dorothy, too, fell prey to a whirlpool!</p>

  <p>"Wait! How could a whirlpool have appeared between the first line and the second line?" Felicity asked, shaking her head in disbelief and looking at Dorothy with suspicion. As she knew of the terrible consequences of being trapped in a whirlpool, surely she wouldn't look so relaxed if her words were true. "Dora, this isn't a laughing matter. Tell me the truth, or I will get very angry."</p>

  <p>Seeing Felicity's expression wiped the smile off Dorothy's face. "I'm not kidding. There was indeed a whirlpool, and we did fall into it. It's just that Luo Zheng dived into the sea and pulled out a candle,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy explained, gesturing with her hand to demonstrate. "After he did that, the whirlpool just disappeared."</p>

  <p>"A candle?" Felicity tilted her head, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Even though she was less suspicious of Dorothy, she was still confused.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was stubborn, but she was no liar. It seemed that she was indeed being serious.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you saw; tell me every detail!" Felicity said seriously.</p>

  <p>After Dorothy had told her the whole story, Felicity took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Could you ask Luo Zheng to help Evaristus?" she asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>Dorothy thought for a moment. "I don't see how that would be a problem," she said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Felicity smiled for what seemed like the first time in ages. Pulling Dorothy aside, she said, "Let's go to Daisy's home. I will tell her the good news."</p>

  <p>Before Dorothy had realized what was happening, she suddenly felt her head spinning. Felicity had pulled her up into the air, and they teleported instantly to the other side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>There stood a magnificent, cyan-gray palace.</p>

  <p>This palace stood opposite the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Many disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace would ask who lived in that palace. If whoever it belonged to was able to live so near to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he or she must be a person of great power, influence or both.</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples could not get the correct answer. Very few of them figured it out, but they stayed silent and kept it to themselves.</p>

  <p>They knew the owner of the palace opposite them was the Taiyi Heaven Palace's leader's equal.</p>

  <p>After they had entered the palace, Felicity took Dorothy by the hand and led her straight to the backyard, where a woman in a white robe sat in a small pavilion.</p>

  <p>The woman was, perhaps, even more beautiful than Felicity. But her brows were deeply furrowed, and her face was etched with sadness.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A beam of light flashed through the backyard and landed outside the pavilion.</p>

  <p>"Daisy," said Felicity to the woman in white.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Daisy," Dorothy called out.</p>

  <p>Daisy looked back at the two, her beautiful face deadpan. "Oh, hello there.</p>

  <p>Felicity and Dora, what brings you here?" she asked, her tone flat.</p>

  <p>Evaristus was her son, and after the accident, she had lost all interest in life.</p>

  <p>Seeing him listless and drunk broke her heart into pieces. However, she still didn't want Evaristus to undergo reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Felicity walked into the pavilion and asked quietly, "Daisy, are you still worried about Evaristus?"</p>

  <p>"So what if I am," Daisy replied harshly, making Felicity recoil. "It seems that your brother-in-law can't find a way to rescue him."</p>

  <p>"Dora fell into a whirlpool, too," said Felicity.</p>

  <p>Daisy's body stiffened in response, and she stared at Dorothy, wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"But someone helped Dora break the whirlpool!" Felicity continued, triumphant.</p>
