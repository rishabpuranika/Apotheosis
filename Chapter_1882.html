  <p>
</p>

  <p>Black life vitality gushed out of the Skyland warriors as they rushed into the sky, condensing into black javelins and shooting towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The life vitality that the Skyland warriors were using seemed to remain at a 'visualization' level. But they were putting this skill to its maximum use.</p>

  <p>These javelins were sharp but they weren't enough to injure Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The black javelins rained down upon Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the sudden attacks, Luo Luo Zheng clenched his fists that began to emit a blinding light, at which the javelins exploded into smithereens with the thundering sounds.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Isaiah was about to resist his powers, Luo Luo Zheng flew towards him, grabbed his wings, and pulled Isaiah to stand before him like a shield for protection.</p>

  <p>The group of Skyland warriors didn't dare throw their javelins now that Isaiah was directly in the line of fire. They glared at Luo Luo Zheng before they started cursing him to no end.</p>

  <p>"No one dares make a move in our race!"</p>

  <p>"Put Isaiah down. This is a capital offense in our race!"</p>

  <p>"It's not too late for you to just kneel and beg for mercy. We do not like to kill. Of course, you might still survive if we gouge out your eyes and put you in the dungeon for a hundred years. Either way, you have to suffer the torment. So don't make any mistakes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes at this.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race was not cultured and developed so well, and Luo Luo Zheng wondered where they had learned these words. These reckless and rude remarks had rendered Luo Luo Zheng speechless and annoyed.</p>

  <p>These threats might have been effective on anyone else, but to Luo Luo Zheng, they were mere jokes.</p>

  <p>"They're right. Let go of me and you will still have a chance to live. But if you don't, no one can save you. The Skyland race controls this place, so you should behave yourself," Isaiah said coldly. The Skyland warriors were arrogant, so he had felt utterly humiliated when Luo Luo Zheng had grabbed his wings, which was a huge taboo in the Skyland race. Isaiah really wanted to beat Luo Luo Zheng to death. But he didn't dare behave recklessly since Luo Luo Zheng was controlling him at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Really? I just want to see who has the right and the guts to take my life," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Noticing that their threats had no effect, the Skyland warriors in the sky exchanged glances before finally deciding to call for reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Lucille and the others were upset and worried.</p>

  <p>How would Luo Luo Zheng be able to deal with the mighty masters of the Skyland race when they arrived on the scene?</p>

  <p>But when they saw that Luo Luo Zheng was still looking calmly, hope bubbled up in their hearts. Was it possible that he had other cards up his sleeve?</p>

  <p>It was not long before a new group of Skyland warriors arrived. When they found Isaiah trapped in Luo Zheng's hands, they merely stood guard in the air. Calm and composed.</p>

  <p>Gradually, more and more Skyland warriors gathered in the sky, but not one of them recognized Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They thought of Luo Luo Zheng as some kind of a reckless warrior.</p>

  <p>A loud sound rent the air, causing everyone's ears to go numb.</p>

  <p>A figure emerged, leaving a trail of light in the sky as it charged straight towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let go of my son!" the man roared with rage and flapped his wings. A blood-red spear appeared in his hands, one that he had created through his visualization.</p>

  <p>He thrust it towards Luo Luo Zheng, the action dripping with fury.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could have used Isaiah as a shield, but he didn't. Instead, he began to activate his power, a calm expression on his face.</p>

  <p id="top">Luo Luo Zheng had already figured out the opponent's strength, and he knew that he was one of the top warriors of the Skyland race. It was also possible that he was qualified to join the Divinity Hunt Squad if he was in the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body and the power of the Path Platforms were not enough to withstand the attack. As Luo Luo Zheng pointed at his opponent, an invisible force appeared on his fingertip. A power drawn out of the nine stars.</p>

  <p>His fingertips touched the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>The opponent paled as he felt an irresistible force emanating from the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>It became difficult for him to grasp the spear with both hands.</p>

  <p>As the long spear left his hand, it disintegrated into streams of life vitality in the air.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Skyland race were stunned.</p>

  <p>The Skyland warriors had gone back to call for reinforcements when Luo Luo Zheng had captured Isaiah.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had caused such a ruckus, they hadn't gone to inform the senior leaders of the Skyland race. They felt that it was not necessary for their senior leaders to deal with a nobody like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One of them went to inform Isaiah's father, Roy, who was one of the elders of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Roy was so powerful that his strength was considered to be one of the top ten of the Skyland race. They had waited a long time before they had finally managed to get Isaiah's father to come. And now, they all felt that this farce was about to end. Luo Luo Zheng would finally receive the severest punishment of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Everyone was just expecting to watch a good show.</p>

  <p>But they hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to stand his ground and fight. What was more, he had directly attacked Roy's spear!</p>

  <p>He eventually broke the spear that Roy had created through his imagination.</p>

  <p>They suddenly realized that they had heavily underestimated Luo Luo Zheng. They wondered who had sent Luo Luo Zheng to cause trouble for the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>And why had Luo Luo Zheng barged into the territory of the Skyland race so brazenly? He was absolutely crazy and reckless! No matter how strong he was, he would be no match for the top warriors of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Besides, there was no point in causing trouble there.</p>

  <p>As an elder of the Skyland race, Roy should have been present when the Collapsing Mountain warriors had come to visit yesterday.</p>

  <p>But recently, the Qin Clan had sent him a copy of the 'Mysterious Transformation Technique'. The comprehension of life vitality in this cultivation method had refreshed him and he chose to cultivate in seclusion for a month. That was why he had never seen Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>"Brat, tell me your name! I'll let you die a little faster!" Roy was furious at the sight of his son immobile in Luo Zheng's arms, his wings trapped.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed. The Collapsing Mountain warriors were much kinder than the Skyland warriors. While the Skyland warriors were beautiful to look at, they were arrogant and domineering. Both the races had been formed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but why were the members of the two races so different?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not answer and Roy lost his patience. He waved both his hands, and streams of black life vitality surged out of his body, twisting into mysterious patterns. Each strand of life vitality turned into a peculiar mystical crystal that revolved around him.</p>

  <p>The crystals were flawless, and they even contained great momentum.</p>

  <p>They continued to come together, combining to form a huge array.</p>

  <p>As a martial artist below them saw this, he muttered, "The Shadow Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>The Skyland warriors couldn't become Godly Geniuses, but they could cultivate the techniques of the three thousand Divine Dao. The cultivation methods that the Skyland warriors practiced were passed down from the divine land. Most of them had been given by the Han Clan and the Qin Clan, which was why disciples of the two clans always got special treatment and care in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Once the warrior had finished talking, he slapped his head and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>All the martial artists from other races felt that something bad was about to happen. Roy's full strength was on par with that of a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the power of the life vitality covered a vast area. If they stayed here, they would inevitably be injured.</p>

  <p>So all the warriors rose into the air, wanting to avoid injury.</p>

  <p>But at this precise moment, a large group of Skyland warriors rushed over.</p>

  <p>One of them said, "Roy, stop!"</p>

  <p>The voice came from far away, but it was transmitted through the life vitality and resounded in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Roy was furious and no one could persuade him to stop. But there was one person who could make Roy listen to him: Kaydan, the head of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>"Sir!"</p>

  <p>Roy glared indignantly at Luo Luo Zheng. He could let him live a while longer, but he would definitely kill him sometime.</p>

  <p>Lone, Kurt, and Lucille were even more worried as they saw that all the senior leaders of the Skyland race were gathered here. They were afraid that Luo Luo Zheng might not be able to escape his doom this time.</p>

  <p>They might also be punished and that wasn't a thought they were fond of.</p>

  <p>With Kaydan in the lead, this group of warriors, including Chapman and other Collapsing Mountain warriors, landed on the platform.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone, except Han Liusu, now thought that Luo Luo Zheng was about to receive a severe punishment.</p>

  <p>Even Roy had the exact same thought.</p>

  <p>However, Kaydan's next words confused Roy to no end.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, why didn't you inform me before going to cultivate in the Tidal Surge? Why did you cause such a commotion?" Kaydan asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Roy was puzzled and surprised. He could not figure out who Luo Luo Zheng was and why their head was so respectful to him.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one who was shocked. Even Isaiah, who Luo Luo Zheng had captured, was stunned as he exchanged glances with his father.</p>
