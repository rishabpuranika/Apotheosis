  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the inner world, various sacred places, large clans started to fight for these rays of light that contained the internal momentum. The light rays were in such a demand that many sects even started a war.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Luo Zheng did not want Evil God to build his own divine kingdom and gather the Faith Energy. Hence, he had cut off Evil God's intentions.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, Evil God dismissed his divine kingdom. And that was when Luo Luo Zheng established a new rule in the inner world. No martial artists were allowed to establish a divine kingdom. Nor were they allowed to light the incense to absorb the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Every time a powerful warrior appeared and proclaimed his intention to develop the sect into a divine kingdom, Evil God would interfere and abolish the warrior's purpose.</p>

  <p>So far, Evil God proved to be the strongest martial artist in the inner world. As a result, nobody dared to oppose him. The martial artists did not have a clue about Evil God's opposition. Hence they had no option.</p>

  <p>As the strongest martial artist in the inner world, Evil God's strength had far exceeded that of an ordinary martial artist. Although those powerful martial artists didn't know why Evil God did not allow it, they had no choice but to develop the sects into the sacred places. Therefore, there were only sacred places in this world and no divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not interfere when the sacred places were fighting for the light containing the internal momentum. A baby world took its own time to grow up slowly. That was the nature's rule. As long as they did not seriously affect the balance of the world, the way Evil God had done back then.</p>

  <p>If one looked closely, a lone figure could be seen atop a mountain.</p>

  <p>Evil God sat cross legged on the top of the mountain, alone.</p>

  <p>Ever since Evil God had retired, he became a legend, his position just next to the world's creator. He was in charge of managing the inner world.</p>

  <p>Very few exceptional masters were aware about his existence.</p>

  <p>The strange phenomenon continued to develop in the sky. At the same time, Evil God felt the blockage that had been trapped inside his body, was released.</p>

  <p>This barrier was not caused by his own strength, but by the world itself.</p>

  <p>Previously, no world lord was allowed to appear in this world, so he was destined to continue his existence in the same cultivation level.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng's Godly Tile matured, he was like a wild horse, freeing himself from the limits of the world and stepping into the world lord realm.</p>

  <p>When one became a world lord, he or she would disturb the vitality between heaven and earth and transform it into a Boundary Cloud. This Boundary Cloud attracted Luo Zheng's attention because of its increasing size.</p>

  <p>"Ten miles. Twenty miles. Thirty miles."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head and looked at the rapidly expanding Boundary Cloud, with a trace of surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The most exceptional world lord in the Evolutionary Universe could only spread out a Boundary Cloud of twenty miles. Hence, Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to see that the capacity of Evil God's inner world was far beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Finally, Evil God's Boundary Cloud stopped after it expanded over sixty miles.</p>

  <p>Actually, Evil God didn't even know the significance of the Boundary Cloud. After all, he was the first master to become the world lord. The sixty miles' Boundary Cloud was enough to make all the others feel inferior.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, several figures ascended up the snow mountain. Actually, the snow mountain was the residence of the entire family of Evil God. When they saw Evil God breaking through, they quickly rushed up to witness the sight.</p>

  <p>"Dad, you've made a breakthrough again! That is awesome!"</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, darling!"</p>

  <p>"Finally Dad, you have been freed of the blockage that had been troubling you since so many years ago."</p>

  <p>Evil God had a faint smile of joy on his face, but stepping into this new realm was just a small achievement for him. When the Godly Tile was condensed, Evil God knew that the path of martial arts had come to an end, and it was the beginning of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Just then, he turned around and saw a figure approaching from a distance. Evil God patted his daughter's head and said to his wife, "I'll be right back."</p>

  <p>Through the Space Law, Evil God appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng. He did not show the courtesy of kneeling in front of Luo Luo Zheng, as he knew Luo Luo Zheng did not really bother about these formalities.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. That was a commendable feat," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Evil God nodded and said, "Thank you." He thought for a moment and then asked, "There is something different now. Creator, have you also broken through?"</p>

  <p>"Yes I have," replied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This world has restrained my growth because of its size. Creator, is it possible for you to increase your cultivation base faster? Or could I travel to a different world?" Evil God asked cautiously, as he feverishly hoped that his Creator would fulfill his request.</p>

  <p>Evil God didn't like such invisible shackles. He also thought that his cultivation base had grown faster than Luo Zheng's. If he could untie these shackles, he might even surpass his Creator.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Evil God calmly with a smile on his face. He said, "You may not know the nature of this world yet. You are very lucky to be born in this world. All of you."</p>

  <p>Evil God was slightly stunned hearing his words. "What do you mean, Creator?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you try to bring the creatures from your inner world to this world?" Luo Luo Zheng asked patiently.</p>

  <p>Evil God nodded as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng. After reaching the Spirit Supreme Realm, he did try to take out the creatures in his inner world. However, the moment he took them out, those creatures instantly dissipated, turning into a wisp of life vitality.</p>

  <p>And Evil God just could not figure out the reason behind it.</p>

  <p>"The people outside of this world also have inner worlds, similarly to yours. The creatures who leave their inner worlds come to an end, just as you see it," Luo Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, no matter it was the low-rank True God or the consummate True God, no one could release the creatures from their inner worlds. Only the Holy Beings who created the universes could do that. But, even then there were rigid rules and regulations. That was, only if one stepped into the Divine Dao and got the recognition of the Divine Dao could he become an "ordinary creature" and then be qualified to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Luo Zheng was qualified to enter the divine land after he was acknowledged by the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. Later in the Heavenly Han House, he obtained the recognition of hundreds of Divine Dao by using the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the special condition of the chaotic world built by Luo Luo Zheng, Evil God wouldn't be able to go out all his life. At least, he had to wait until Luo Luo Zheng became a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Evil God's expression changed slightly. "So you mean to say that when I leave this world, even I will turn into a ball of life vitality, just like the creatures in my inner world?"</p>

  <p>"If you are in the inner world made by other True Gods, then yes, even you will face similar situation. But my inner world is special. The creatures that leave this world won't be dissipated into life vitality. So you will have to wait, as I will let you know when it is appropriate to leave." Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Evil God was completely perplexed. He could not comprehend what his Creator had imparted. There seemed to be other gods also existing in the world where his Creator was in. 'All the inner worlds constructed by those gods are the same as mine.</p>

  <p>Then why is Creator's inner world any different?</p>

  <p>How many gods are there in the world where Creator is?</p>

  <p>Could they cultivate the internal momentum as well?'</p>

  <p>Countless questions were going through Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>It was not that Evil God was not smart. In fact, he possessed the highest intelligence quotient.</p>

  <p>However, the level of his life was limited.</p>

  <p>As Evil God had grown up in this relatively narrow world, he couldn't understand the boundless divine land. With his current knowledge and experience, he was always under the impression that Luo Zheng's world was about the same size as this world.</p>

  <p>"I have my own Godly Tile now, so now there are some things that I need your help to accomplish," Luo Luo Zheng said quietly.</p>

  <p>There was only a small segment of people, who were aware of Luo Zheng's existence. After the Godly Tile was condensed, Luo Luo Zheng could absorb the Faith Energy through the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy was the momentum of a world. After a proving godly warrior became a True God, they would usually give up their life vitality and use the Faith Energy, to prevent the life vitality from being consumed.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was still a little confused about choosing the Faith Energy or continuing using the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>For an ordinary True God, using life vitality to display a token was a far too energy consuming thing. If the life vitality was consumed too much, it could even cause the entire inner world to collapse and the inner world would have to be rebuilt. However, Luo Zheng's chaotic energy was very durable compared to the life vitality. Moreover, Luo Zheng's World Tree was able to continuously absorb the chaotic energy from the outside world.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng didn't require the Faith Energy at the moment.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng still needed to figure out the difference between the Faith Energy produced by the world that was constructed through chaos and the Faith Energy of the other True Gods.</p>

  <p>Evil God was naturally willing to help Luo Luo Zheng, after all he had collected the Faith Energy before.</p>
