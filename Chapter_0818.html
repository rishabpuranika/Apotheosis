  <p>
</p>

  <p>Phoebe saw the puzzlement on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>From his expression, she already knew what was on his mind. So, she smiled and started to explain in detail, "The Tower of Sin is quite a peculiar tower. It seems like a living creature and can absorb everything within it."</p>

  <p>"Absorb everything?" Luo Zheng's expression became even more puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right. Regardless of whether it is blood or something else, anything lifeless will be absorbed by this tower. If you leave a weapon on the floor for too long, it will also be absorbed," Phoebe explained.</p>

  <p>"Wait? You mean it can even absorb weapons?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>Phoebe nodded, "Any lifeless object will be absorbed after being placed on the floor for a period. Say, for example, someone died and no one collected his body for a period, it would also be absorbed by this tower as well."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in awe. But before he could comment further, a milky white light suddenly condensed in the arena and shot into the token hanging on the ogre's chest.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was unclear on what exactly that light was, he could sense that it contained extremely pure energy. He felt an attraction to it and had an instinct to snatch that energy and refine it.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's a reward given by the Tower of Sin. It is called the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>Defeating your opponent in the arena will get you the Lucky Light. The stronger your opponent you defeat, the more Lucky Light you will get,"</p>

  <p>Phoebe explained to Luo Luo Zheng patiently. "There is a popular belief on the Sea God Continent that the Tower of Sin turns the things it absorbs into the Lucky Light."</p>

  <p>"Lucky Light!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time that Luo Luo Zheng had seen the Lucky Light. He had seen it before in the Dragon Soar Arena. The Dragon Soar Arena had accumulated the Lucky Light for countless years, but most of it had all been absorbed by Luo Luo Zheng. By absorbing a large amount of Lucky Light, Luo Zheng's cultivation level had greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>However, the Lucky Light in front of him was different from that in the Dragon Soar Arena. The Lucky Light here did not directly enter one's body, but into one's token.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon also discovered the problem and laughed in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. With the naked eye, the Lucky Light in the Tower of Sin appears to be the same with that in the Dragon Soar Arena. However, the Lucky Light in the Dragon Soar Arena could enhance one's cultivation level directly, while the Lucky Light here can only be used after refinement."</p>

  <p>"I got it."</p>

  <p>Only now did Luo Luo Zheng understand why the creatures on the Sea God Continent valued the Tower of Sin so much.</p>

  <p>Cultivating in the Dragon Soar Arena wasn't that bad, but it needed a long time for the Dragon Soar Arena to accumulate the Lucky Light. Luo Luo Zheng was the first to enter the Dragon Soar Arena, and he had absorbed almost all the Lucky Light in it. As a result, the amount of Lucky Light gained by those people who entered the Dragon Soar Arena after Luo Luo Zheng was much less.</p>

  <p>In this Tower of Sin, however, once you defeated your opponent, you would be able to obtain the Lucky Light which would allow you to rapidly increase your cultivation level.</p>

  <p>With the potential that the Tower of Sin had, controlling it would mean that one's race would have a super sacred place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>But the Sea God Continent had many races, and the existence of the Cursed Land had hindered the strongest warriors on the continent to enter the Tower of Sin. As a result, no race from the Sea God Continent had completely taken control of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin could produce the greatest cultivators in each race.</p>

  <p>However, since no one from the Sea God Continent had taken control of the said tower, no one from its race had ruled the world yet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts analyzing the situation when the ogre war fighter named "Borgan" coldly swept a glance around and roared, "I still want to fight. Who dares to come up?"</p>

  <p>"Borgan already won six consecutive victories today!"</p>

  <p>"Challenging him is like digging your own grave! I don't think anyone is ready to die just yet!"</p>

  <p>"Those talents are all cultivating in seclusion. I bet no one will dare to challenge Borgan."</p>

  <p>The creatures in the audience could be heard discussing among themselves.</p>

  <p>Despite Borgan's constant growling, no one had stepped into the arena to answer the challenge.</p>

  <p>Deep down, Borgan was proud of himself. He knew that everyone was afraid of him. But he wouldn't pass the chance to show off his strength. He looked around and noticed Luo Luo Zheng from the crowd. He said, "Human war fighter? Ha-ha! Humans would only enter the Tower of Sin after becoming war generals. When did a human war fighter dare to enter the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>After Borgan finished, everyone shifted their eyes to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Humans didn't have a high position on the Sea God Continent and were considered relatively weak. Although the famous Purple Heart Sacred Place was maintained by a few powerful humans, they didn't have any strong disciples.</p>

  <p>Hence, no one would inherit the Purple Heart Sacred Place once those powerful humans perished. Eventually, the Purple Heart Sacred Place would be ancient history.</p>

  <p>On the Sea God Continent, the Tower of Sin was a place that every race would fight for. Humans would go to the Tower of Sin every year for cultivation, but they would usually enter the tower only after becoming war generals. It was very rare to see human war fighters in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>'An ogre war fighter?' Luo Luo Zheng thought. His gaze flickered, and a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to show off his skills as it was his first time to enter the Tower of Sin. Right now, he just wanted to learn more about the situation here. But even if he wasn't looking for a fight, a fight had a way to find him.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect to be a target the moment he entered.</p>

  <p>"Hey, human war fighter! Are you up for the challenge? Let me tear your neck off!" Borgan roared.</p>

  <p>"That ogre wants to fight you," reminded Phoebe with a smile. Her mission was to keep an eye on Luo Luo Zheng and wait for Elder Mei to unravel the secret of his sword spirit. Earlier, he had been chased by three ogre war lords for more than a thousand miles. Seeing how Luo Luo Zheng had dodged the three ogre war lords, she was sure that Luo Luo Zheng could handle being in the arena with Borgan.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case..." Luo Luo Zheng flexed his wrists a bit and walked up into the arena.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a first! The human brat came into the arena!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. Aren't you humans all cowards? How many years has it been since I last saw a human war fighter step into the arena?"</p>

  <p>"Borgan, tear his neck apart. Eat his flesh! Human flesh is delicious."</p>

  <p>All the creatures thought that this was a battle of a great disparity in strength. They were already expecting that Borgan would win easily in this fight. They were looking forward to seeing Borgan torture Luo Luo Zheng to death.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the Tower of Sin was filled with deaths and killing intentions. In fact, from the moment it was built, the atmosphere and theme of the tower had always been like this.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised that you dare to step into the arena." Borgan licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"Now I know that humans are not only born cowards but also stupid! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not angered at all with Borgan's remarks. His poker face didn't change at Borgan's taunting as if he was looking at a dead man already.</p>

  <p>Borgan, on the other hand, did not like this look. It was as if Luo Luo Zheng was a powerful person looking down at him. He didn't know where Luo Luo Zheng could have gotten this kind of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Borgan was already pissed off by Luo Zheng's look. He didn't like that Luo Zheng's Mu Ning was more menacing than his. He had to tear this human apart to make up for the latter's arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Die, human brat! Wail as loud as you can!" Borgan roared, and the forceful energy within his body suddenly erupted. He was like a wild beast, rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Not all humans are cowards!" Luo Luo Zheng said coldly as he stretched out a finger to face the approaching Borgan.</p>

  <p>The moment Borgan rushed towards him, Luo Zheng's hand suddenly moved, and his finger pressed on Borgan's head.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure moved slightly to the side, dodging Borgan's massive body. He only took one step aside during the entire process.</p>

  <p>People in the audience only saw Borgan's head turning into a cloud of blood. The headless body took a few steps before flopping onto the floor.</p>

  <p>People's voices died away and silence reigned.</p>

  <p>This bloodshed was nothing new in the Tower of Sin. These bloodsheds would often take place in duels with great disparity in strength.</p>

  <p>The creatures were not surprised to see Luo Zheng's method of killing Borgan.</p>

  <p>They were dumbfounded by the fact that he was human.</p>

  <p>Humans had many known talents. Otherwise, they wouldn't be considered one of the thirteen great races.</p>

  <p>However, human war fighters were far behind the other creatures on the Sea God Continent. Entering the Tower of Sin when a human was still a war fighter was like digging his own grave. As such, almost all the warriors that the Purple Heart Sacred Place sent into the Tower of Sin were war generals.</p>

  <p>But this level seven human war fighter was different. Despite his level, he had defeated Borgan with only a finger.</p>

  <p>This surprised most of the creatures in the Tower of Sin. It was something they had never seen in many years.</p>

  <p>The dead silence was broken when the creatures began to whisper among themselves.</p>

  <p>The blood of the ogre war fighter slowly seeped into the arena, and a milky white light suddenly appeared shooting into Luo Zheng's token.</p>

  <p>After being infused with the Lucky Light, this ordinary metal token began to feel heavy.</p>

  <p>'Immortal Mist is right. The Tower of Sin is indeed a good place to quickly increase my cultivation level. But it's also not easy to enter the bottom of the Tower of Sin, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself as he stood in the arena.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to walk off, another burly figure walked up into the arena. "Kid, do you want to leave after you just won?"</p>

  <p></p>
