  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng obtained the Soul Nurturing Wood, he quickly returned to the plaza. Even though he tried his best to keep calm, he still could not suppress the excitement on his face.</p>

  <p>The numerous Soul Sea Realm masters who saw this were certain that Luo Zheng wanted to use the Soul Nurturing Wood to rescue someone's life, but they just had no idea who it was.</p>

  <p>As for War Emperor York and Marine, they looked highly displeased.</p>

  <p>They truly didn't expect that the little monster they had sent out would fail to kill Luo Zheng. Aside from that, they were also fuming because Luo Zheng had been granted with incredible gifts. How could they cope with such a failure?</p>

  <p>Although the cyan dragon confirmed that Xun's soul could survive for a day or two, it was nothing but a probability and an estimate. That happening had the exact same chance as her soul immediately collapsing after a couple of hours!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hurriedly asked the cyan dragon, "How do you use this Soul Nurturing Wood?"</p>

  <p>But the moment he asked that, the shrill voice rang out again, and it said,</p>

  <p>"The fight is over. Now we will begin the sacrificial ceremony! Open the Feather Holy Sea!"</p>

  <p>The moment they heard the voice, all of the divine-level talents turned their gazes towards the platform. The matches that had happened beforehand were only a way to test the strength of the warriors. What was really important was the exploration of the Feather Holy Sea!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not in the mood to pay attention to the sacrificial ceremony that was going to happen. For him, there was only one thing he needed to do before anything else� placing Xun in the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>If Xun's soul had not fallen into a deep sleep, she could have entered the Soul Nurturing Wood all by herself. But because it was unconscious, the cyan dragon told Luo Zheng that he had to move her soul into the Soul Nurturing Wood instead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around and found a relatively quiet corner in the wide plaza.</p>

  <p>He sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes before immersing himself in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Inside his mind, he saw Xun's soul still lying quietly, cracks appearing on its surface.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew over and hugged her, dragging her out from his mind.</p>

  <p>Before he did, however, he turned around to look at the mysterious furnace. The light shining from the cyan dragon and the red dragon on top of it had also dimmed down by quite a bit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had paid a heavy price for his battle with the little monster, but the rewards he had reaped were great. First of all, after fusing with the world's will, Zheng's soul had risen to a new level. More importantly, he could connect his body to the whole world.</p>

  <p>With that, the attacks he would suffer could be offloaded to the great world!</p>

  <p>Aside from that, there was still a tremendous amount of information that Luo Zheng had to fully explore.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>According to the method taught to him by the cyan dragon, Luo Zheng placed the segment of the Soul Nurturing Wood between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng moved Xun's soul out of his mind, her soul immediately entered the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>Within a short while, Xun's soul completely disappeared, and the segment of the Soul Nurturing Wood emitted a faint red light. When Luo Zheng touched the Soul Nurturing Wood, it felt warm.</p>

  <p>'This Soul Nurturing Wood is such a miracle!' he thought, thanking the heavens and letting out a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Although Xun's soul was seriously injured, it would easily recover with the help of this Soul Nurturing Wood. As its name suggested, it had the ability to nurture the soul. Luo Zheng truly believed that after a certain period of time, Xun's soul would make a complete recovery!</p>

  <p>But even if Xun couldn't completely recover, Luo Zheng would still have enough time to help her find the elixir that would be able to fully heal her soul.</p>

  <p>While Xun had not been with him for a long time, ever since she had chosen to accompany him, she had helped him survive through countless calamities.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would never forget the kindness she had shown him!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished dealing with Xun's soul, the sacrificial ceremony on the platform had already begun!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge circular light column suddenly appeared on the high platform.</p>

  <p>Right after it appeared, however, it suddenly shot upwards and into the air.</p>

  <p>"Is this the sacrificial ceremony? I wonder what it is for,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng mumbled to himself, saddened as he didn't know much about the Divine Kingdom Continent. However, as soon as he thought of this, he rolled his eyes and tapped his head. He had forgotten that he had the ability to comprehend everything!</p>

  <p>An idea flashed through Zheng's mind, and he already knew the answer.</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea had originally been occupied by the Dragon Lineage Human. Before the Dragon Lineage Human had died, they had killed all of the creatures within their race and made a blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Dragon Lineage Human was also considered as something flourishing for a time. The sacred place of the Dragon Lineage Human was at the late stage of eighth grade, even highly comparable to a ninth-grade power. It was far stronger than the seven great divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>Before they got destroyed, the number of Dragon Lineage Human members had been terrifyingly high.</p>

  <p>In fact, a blood sacrifice was a curse!</p>

  <p>After living creatures were killed through the ritual, a curse would be born. This would be the source of the malicious Mu Ning of the warriors.</p>

  <p>However, the Dragon Lineage Human had cleverly used this curse in their favor. They employed this curse after sacrificing all of the creatures in their clan. It meant that every being that stepped into the Feather Holy Sea would be affected by the curse.</p>

  <p>And this curse was manifested through a layer of golden light on the surface of the sea!</p>

  <p>What the four divine kingdoms needed to do was to temporarily disperse a portion of that golden light. Only then would they be able to smoothly allow warriors to enter the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>As that light column shot up into the sky, all the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters under the steps rose up at the same time. The four rulers of the divine kingdoms occupied the top position, and dozens of other Soul Sea Realm masters below started releasing their life vitality.</p>

  <p>The shrill voice once again spoke, "Everyone, let's work together to dispel the curse in the Feather Holy Sea!"</p>

  <p>This sharp voice would be heard from time to time, but the identity of the person behind it was still unknown. Ever since the beginning, he had never revealed anything about him, making him extremely mysterious.</p>

  <p>Under his direction, the huge light column that shot into the sky slowly tilted, and started heading towards the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Hoo, hoo, hoo...</p>

  <p>At that moment, violent winds surged, and the skies changed color.</p>

  <p>The various divine-level talents all looked at the scene in front of them, their face determined.</p>

  <p>The moment the light column slanted and touched the Feather Holy Sea, it fused with the golden light that was coming from the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Then, a miraculous scene occurred. The light within the light column seemed to be fighting the golden light on the surface of Feather Holy Sea. The moment the light column entered the sea, the golden light was continuously eroded by the light column.</p>

  <p>The originally tranquil Feather Holy Sea suddenly became frantic, like struggling giant monster. Enormous waves started appearing on the golden ocean and it went in all directions, layer by layer!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the golden light seemed to have melted and shrank at an incredibly fast speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed. Although he already knew the process of the sacrifice from the memories that flashed before him, he was still incomparably shocked when he saw this scene with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>This method couldn't possibly have been thought of by the four divine kingdoms members. Presumably, they had also received help from the humans of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>After five minutes, the Feather Holy Sea slowly calmed down and the light column also began to dim.</p>

  <p>The surface of the Feather Holy Sea was still suffused with the faint golden light. However, compared to before, the color of the golden light was much, much lighter.</p>

  <p>After the light column disappeared, a person was standing there. That person wore a steel gray robe, and both of his eyebrows were snow-white. He did not seem angry, but had a solemn Mu Ning. He was a Taoist priest with white eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Alright! The sacrificial ceremony is over. Everyone can get the dragon blood and enter the Feather Holy Sea!"</p>

  <p>The Taoist priest exclaimed. He was the person behind the shrill voice!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked at the Taoist priest, he seemed to notice him. After he casually glanced at Luo Zheng, he ordered the Soul Sea Realm masters of the four great divine kingdoms to give out the dragon blood.</p>

  <p>'I can't figure out how strong he is, ' Luo Zheng thought. Suddenly, his heart began to race.</p>

  <p>Even a Soul Sea Realm master would find it difficult not to let Luo Zheng figure out his cultivation level. This time, however, Luo Zheng was completely stumped as to what the Taoist priest's cultivation level was!</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility. The Taoist priest was definitely not just at the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>"Aren't only the Soul Sea Realm masters and those below this level allowed to exist in the Lower World?" Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon in confusion.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, even the Soul Sea Realm masters couldn't be tolerated by the great world. When Life and Death Realm warriors appeared in the world, the Heavenly Law would punish them with the life and death crisis� something that could also be called as the small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Right after a warrior had reached the Soul Sea Realm, the Nature Law would bring down the large Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
