  <p>Outside the forbidden land, the Holy Beings noticed this peculiar scene.</p>

  <p>This made all of them confused, causing their long faces.</p>

  <p>After all, it was true that many True Gods that wandered in the forbidden land were descendants of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with the forbidden land? Why are there so many Time Ghosts?" a Holy Being asked.</p>

  <p>Normally, the first stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land housed no more than eight ghosts so when the Holy Beings noticed the increase in Time Ghosts, all of them were alarmed.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race's leader wore a mask so her expression was hidden from everyone. "It seems that the level of difficulty in the Time Sea Forbidden Land has increased," she said.</p>

  <p>The controller of each forbidden land had the ability to manipulate the difficulty of the forbidden land to a certain extent, and ever since the forbidden lands appeared in the divine land, their difficulty had only constantly increased as the space they took up became bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Soul Wilderness, a level-six forbidden land, located in the Spiritual Soul Region, at first only took up about one tenth of the said region. However, every divine era, it would expand and encroach on a portion of the Spiritual Soul Region.</p>

  <p>The Soul Wilderness had expanded at a terrifyingly fast rate and now, it covered the entire Spiritual Soul Region and was still expanding closer to its two neighboring regions. The divine citizens living in the two regions had no choice but to migrate in fear that they would be caught within the forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Other forbidden lands like the Swirl Forest and the Time Sea were also expanding. Day by day, the Time Sea took up more area, steadily growing and never stopping.</p>

  <p>This birthed a belief that the entire divine land would be completely devoured by the forbidden lands one day.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the difficulty within your control?" another Holy Being asked.</p>

  <p>The leader shook her head. "No, the situation is different this time. It seems that a new supreme treasure of belief has appeared."</p>

  <p>"A supreme treasure of belief?"</p>

  <p>"You mean a new supreme treasure of belief has appeared in the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>"What is its level?"</p>

  <p>Her words had caused a concerned chattering from the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas had black and white mists swirling in his eyes, evidence of his astonishment.</p>

  <p>Majority of the weapons in the divine land were supreme primordial weapons. Before the creation of supreme chaotic weapons, most of the weapons in the divine land such as sabers, swords, and axes had been supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>But after the appearance of the supreme chaotic weapons, the status of the supreme primordial weapons declined. However, both presented their own pros and cons. The supreme primordial weapons were better in their profound foundation while the supreme chaotic weapons were powerful because they allowed the indirect use of strong chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But compared to the supreme treasures of belief, all these weapons made by the weapon refiners were not even worth mentioning!</p>

  <p>When the forbidden lands appeared in his inner world, Luo Zheng had managed to figure out the origin of the forbidden lands in the divine land. He found that all the forbidden lands in the divine land were formed by the imagination of countless divine citizens. In other words, they were created by Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The supreme treasure of belief was the same. They were special and powerful weapons thought up by countless divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Each treasure had its own level of power which the True Gods in the divine land associated with that of the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Even the forbidden land with the lowest level could produce a supreme treasure of belief. And while it would only be at level-one, owning this treasure would be equivalent to becoming controller of this level-one forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a level-two forbidden land could only produce one level-two supreme treasure of belief, however, level-one supreme treasures might exist as well.</p>

  <p>Although few people knew about the Time Sea Forbidden Land, the concept of time deeply instilled in everyone's minds. Every time they thought about time, it turned into a strand of Faith Energy which gathered in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Time Sea Forbidden Land could easily match any other level-six forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>A level-six supreme treasure of belief had long appeared in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, and after the Sun Blind race's leader got it, she became controller of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The level-six supreme treasures of belief were known as the most powerful weapons to exist and could affect the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>A second level-six supreme treasure of belief would not appear in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, but there might still be a level-five or level-four treasure. And while these treasures didn't have the ability to control living creatures in the divine land like the Time Sword of Gods, they still had many powerful theurgies.</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Beings from the large clans on the Floating Islands were rarely presented with the opportunity to obtain a supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>For example, the Holy Being of the Qin Clan had a level-one supreme treasure of belief, an S-shaped jade, which was obtained from a level-two forbidden land.</p>

  <p>It was said that in order to buy this treasure, the Qin Clan had spent a large amount of divine might coins, enough to modify two words on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>However, while the level-one supreme treasure of belief might have a relatively powerful token, it had no substantial help to a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Holy Being of the Qin Clan wore it simply as an ornament, and for a time, became a laughingstock in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Considering the powerful theurgies the treasures could employ, it was only natural that even a level-one supreme treasure of belief garnered so much attention from a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>And so when the Holy Beings heard what the female leader said, they all showed great interest.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," the leader of the Sun Blind race shook her head. "It could be a level-three treasure. Maybe even a level-four."</p>

  <p>"A level-four supreme treasure of belief! What good fortune!"</p>

  <p>"This is part of their training. The Time Sea Forbidden Land is probably ten times more dangerous than before, but the benefits are a thousand times greater!"</p>

  <p>"You're right!"</p>

  <p>Initially, the Holy Beings wanted to ask their descendants to retreat from the forbidden land. The Time Sea Forbidden Land was very dangerous, and every day, it only grew more dangerous than before. There was a great possibility they would meet their eternal end if they stayed.</p>

  <p>But even if these Holy Beings wanted their descendants to always be safe and sound, they also wanted them to seize these rare opportunities even more.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings were discussing outside, the True Gods in the forbidden land were faced with life and death crises.</p>

  <p>There were so many Time Ghosts surrounding them that it was almost impossible to escape. Even Luo Zheng worried about their terrible predicament.</p>

  <p>If their enemies were real creatures, they might still be able to fight.</p>

  <p>However, a strange creature like the Time Ghost had no real existence and therefore, could not be fought. The only thing they could do was to escape. But how?</p>

  <p>Scared, Aleyna and Kelsey leaned against Luo Zheng. Kelsey couldn't even stop trembling. She had never been to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land before, and had not once thought that she would face death one day.</p>

  <p>Aleyna, who had at least explored the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, was considerably calmer than Kelsey.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods were equally horrified. If they were not able to handle this, none of them would survive.</p>

  <p>"I'll draw them away while you escape!" Just then, a top-rank True God stood out from the crowd.</p>

  <p>A top-rank True God had the ability to fly. If he drew away the Time Ghosts, the others would have a chance to escape, however, it would be extremely dangerous for him to do so!</p>

  <p>This top-rank True God, who they soon learned was Reginald, came from the War God Hall.</p>

  <p>As he stepped forward for the tough task, all the other True Gods present revealed a look of gratitude on their faces.</p>

  <p>Even Woodruff, the leader of the War God Hall and one of the three Holy Beings of the Moon Clan, wore a proud expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"There's no coward in our War God Hall!"</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that the Time Ghosts flocked over to the crowd.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Reginald shouted his battle cry and charged at the ghosts in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Such a strong fighting intent... His token is exactly the same as Blayd's but he's even more powerful," murmured Luo Zheng, eyes shining with admiration. This top-rank True God really had the courage to stand up for them at this crucial moment.</p>

  <p>Reginald's overwhelming fighting intent had successfully attracted the attention of most of the Time Ghosts closest to them. Then, like a roc spreading its wings, he soared up into the sky!</p>

  <p>After the Time Ghosts chased after him, it was easy for everyone to see a path of escape in front of them.</p>

  <p>However, the Time Ghosts behind the crowd saw them and rushed towards them at a blinding speed.</p>
