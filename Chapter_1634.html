<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two sharp sword moves suddenly appeared and slashed through the air, which caused everyone to be stunned.</p>

  <p>Janet and the others had concluded that Zheng must have only been testing Malachi's strength. Despite Zheng not using his full strength in that attack, it still caught his opponents off guard. They were all in shock after the attack, making it difficult to find their balance as they floated in the air.</p>

  <p>During the tests in the Hall of Causality, Zheng had not showcased the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>He only used his strong body and monstrous strength in the Hall of Causality. Despite that, he was still considered the strongest among his group.</p>

  <p>"I guess he can handle this on his own," Janet sobbed and said. Although she didn't like the idea of Zheng fighting alone, she was sure that he would win this battle.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, onlookers gathered to watch the battle between Zheng and Malachi. Many of them came here to secretly observe regardless of their lives.</p>

  <p>At first, they had other intentions while watching Zheng and Malachi. From what they could see, these young men already obtained a large number of Illusion Points and they would surely benefit from killing them. If they obtained half of their Illusion Points, their rankings would skyrocket and that would help them swiftly enter the forefront of this supreme world.</p>

  <p>As they watched, they waited for the right moment to attack.</p>

  <p>If they attacked, they could either succeed or not. If they did succeed, they could obtain many Illusion Points. If not, the worst that could happen was be killed in the Illusion Battlefield and sent back to the main city.</p>

  <p>However, after witnessing the terrifying strength that Zheng had unleashed, they knew that their crazy plan wouldn't work. They wouldn't waste any effort in something that they knew would be a failure from the start.</p>

  <p>Malachi, who was wielding the Saint Killing Spear, turned pale and trembled. He seemed to be in a daze.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at him and asked in a frigid voice, "Shall we continue?"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't intend to kill Malachi right way. He only wanted to hurt his confidence because in that way, Malachi would lose his focus.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, since they were in the Illusion Battlefield, Zheng wouldn't be able to shatter Malachi's dedication to martial arts. So, the best he could do was to ruthlessly strike at his confidence!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Malachi thrust his Saint Killing Spear out once more.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>But like his first attempt, he didn't succeed. Zheng had deflected it with his long sword. After this, Malachi heard Zheng's arctic voice again.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect an ace talent of the Demon Night to be weak. I'm disappointed."</p>

  <p>Malachi couldn't thrust out the Saint Killing Spear anymore. His back was pressed against the wall this time and he had no way to escape. He could only look at Zheng with despair in his eyes. But even under the constant pressure, he still wanted to get rid of this devilish fellow!</p>

  <p>"You must have already realized the mistake that you made. A sharp weapon is good, but you've already lost your confidence. And since you always rely on your spear, you have forgotten to bring out your real strength." As Zheng spoke those words, the expression on his face lightened up. A faint smile crossed his face and his eyes started to glow.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, those words shattered Malachi's heart into pieces. It was as if he was slapped with the bitter truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng was right. Since the battle began, Malachi had solely relied on the techniques of the Saint Killing Spear and had never used his abilities.</p>

  <p>And ever since Zheng had successfully blocked his attacks, Malachi became extremely passive. If only Malachi knew how to utilize his strength instead of relying on his spear, he might have a chance to defeat Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was quite a powerful weapon, and it had much better techniques if its owner knew what it was capable of.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Malachi didn't know this.</p>

  <p>Since it was forged, the Saint Killing Spear had been driven by the Faith Energy of the Queen of Killings. If a martial artist used his life vitality to yield the spear, it would become an extraordinary weapon. But right now, in the hands of Malachi, it could not show its true form.</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right. I relied too much on the spear," Malachi said in a low voice. But in the blink of an eye, a cold smile crossed Malachi's face. "But you have also made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"What mistake?" Zheng asked as he stared at Malachi's face.</p>

  <p>"Well, you may have cornered me. But you shouldn't have celebrated too early."</p>

  <p>Malachi saw the disbelief on Zheng's face. But before Zheng could say a word, two thin but sharp vines started appearing from the Saint Killing Spear's shaft. One of the vines was colored black, and the other one was white. They grew exponentially and drilled into Malachi's arms.</p>

  <p>No one knew what Malachi was doing. Only Xun would have figured out what he was planning to do.</p>

  <p>Malachi was offering himself to the Saint Killing Spear!</p>

  <p>It was said that the Queen of Killings of the Demon Night, the one who first yielded the spear, led her subordinates to block the invasion of the other races.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Killings didn't want to fail her subordinates even at the expense of her own life.</p>

  <p>In the face of an undefeatable opponent, she activated the final move of the spear by offering herself to the spear.</p>

  <p>By doing so, all her meridians were replaced by Sunrest Wood and Hidden Wood. She became an indestructible killing machine controlled by the spear. Her combat strength increased exponentially, and she lasted for a period.</p>

  <p>Most of the past Queens of Killings who used this technique in a battle didn't survive. But before they died, they would kill two or three of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Back then, Xun was attacked by Yao. In the middle of a fierce battle, Xun didn't choose to offer herself to the Saint Killing Spear because she thought that there was still room to maneuver at that time.</p>

  <p>But she realized she was wrong - only it was already too late. If only she had used the technique, she could have dragged Yao to hell even when the Pool of Faith was sealed.</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, there would be no real death.</p>

  <p>Even if Malachi died by offering himself to the spear, he would only be sent back to the main city and would still be alive. Thus, there wasn't anything that could stop him from using this technique.</p>

  <p>As the two vines penetrated Malachi's arms, his face turned pale as if he was in great pain.</p>

  <p>There were visible bulges under the skin of his arms that were swiftly moving through his body like reptiles crawling under his skin. It was a disgusting sight to see. These vines had quickly spread out through his organs and finally took over his entire body.</p>

  <p>Watching Malachi's transformation, Zheng suddenly felt strange. He sensed something bad was about to happen. It was the same feeling he had during a life and death crisis. He couldn't be wrong about this feeling.</p>

  <p>So, in anticipation of what would happen next, Zheng quickly thrust his sword towards Malachi.</p>

  <p>The sword pierced straight through Malachi's chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng was certain that Malachi wouldn't survive his attack so he drew his sword back. But to his surprise, there was no trace of blood on the blade.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Malachi's blood had already been sucked by the Saint Killing Spear. His blood was already flowing on his black and white spear.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>With one swing, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword had started to display unparalleled power.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to attack and each slash had left a deep wound on Malachi's body.</p>

  <p>The meridians in Malachi's body had already been replaced by the two kinds of divine wood – the Sunrest Wood and the Hidden Wood. These were the sturdiest and most indestructible types of wood just like the Lofty Wood. That was why, despite Zheng's continuous heavy attacks, Malachi's body could not be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Not for long, Malachi finally opened his eyes. They were different from the ones that Zheng had seen before. Malachi's eyes were glazed with a deathly aura. And if it wasn't weird enough, he was also making a weird sound.</p>

  <p>After he offered himself to the Saint Killing Spear, Malachi became the spear's slave. His body was now a lifeless container that the spear could control.</p>

  <p>The changes in Malachi's appearance and aura were alarming and Zheng felt his heart becoming heavy. So, without any hesitation, he retreated to the city walls. He made sure there was a great distance between him and Malachi just to be safe.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Malachi began to move. But it wasn't Malachi anymore, but the spear who was controlling the body's movement.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Malachi's movements might have been as stiff as those of a zombie, but his speed was astonishingly fast. It was so fast that even Zheng was having difficulty following his move.</p>

  <p>With a spear in his hand, Malachi had quickly caught up with Zheng despite the distance. The spear in his hand moved faster than lightning as it pierced towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It slashed through Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>It was just a simple attack, but it was fatal because of its speed that even Zheng couldn't fathom.</p>

  <p>In theory, every martial arts skill in the world had its blind spot. But if mixed with speed, even the basic martial arts skill could be unbeatable.</p>

  <p>When one had reached a high level of speed, every single move could be fatal to his opponent.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng maximized the Eight Smoky Melodies and tried his best to twist his body, it would still be difficult for him to dodge. The spear had finally pierced Zheng's right chest and through his back, leaving four bloody holes on his shoulder. Blood gushed out of his deep wounds.</p>

  <p>The first strike was a success! There was no doubt that the killing intent of the spear was greater.</p>

  <p>Before he offered himself to the spear, Malachi had already conveyed the thought of killing Zheng onto the spear. So, at this moment, the spear was moving on its own, intending to kill Zheng, and it wouldn't stop until Zheng was dead!</p>

  <p>Malachi's right hand gently retracted as the second strike began in no time. But before the spear could hit Zheng with another fatal attack, Zheng had already turned around and charged into the main city.</p>
