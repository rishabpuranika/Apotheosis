<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The needle, twisted and distorted badly, trembled violently as it tried to return to its original straight profile. If it wanted to forcefully break the space, it had to be connected as a whole.</p>

  <p>This was a fight of physics. The needle represented an indestructible mass, but the space had been separated. Consequently, the aftermath was extreme.</p>

  <p>All kinds of shock waves burst and rippled outwards.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge claw-shaped shock wave swept towards Zheng's primitive land, gouging out a large chunk from its surface. Another shock wave drilled into the earth, leaving a pit that was dozens of miles deep.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's primitive land and the downgrader's Burial Land were caught in the line of fire, they were both solid enough to bear the impact.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God had transformed the materials in many large provinces into energy. Consequently, many parts of the Source World were weakened. When the shock waves rained onto the Source World, it cracked like an eggshell.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the entire surface of the Source World was riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, no materials or creatures had been left in these provinces, so it wasn't that big a deal. However, the proud Evil God couldn't tolerate this easily.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>After a few moments of twisting and turning, the indestructible needle finally broke the rules of space.</p>

  <p>The space that bound and distorted the needle broke, and the parts of the needle began to connect again.</p>

  <p>Even though the segments of the needle connected, it was still crooked, since it was forcibly twisted by the In and Out Holes.</p>

  <p>Then, the needle tried to return to its originally straight state, moving like an uncontrollable metal whip that was lashing around violently.</p>

  <p>It smashed anything in its way, without exception.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A deafening sound of grinding metal echoed throughout the space as the needle tried to stretch back to a straight profile, a small crooked part of it shooting towards the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>"What in the world..."</p>

  <p>The downgrader's eyes widened as he saw the incoming needle.</p>

  <p>He initially had absolute advantage over the whole situation.</p>

  <p>He had felt like the Source World didn't even qualify to join this battle, and figured they would be the first to suffer.</p>

  <p>Even he could tell that the Evil God was trying to drag out his feeble existence at this point.</p>

  <p>Yet, how did the tables turn so suddenly?</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the needle whipped towards the Burial Land at a terrifying speed, the downgrader's eyes darted all over the place as he tried to come up with a solution. He wanted to build a hole, but the space in this area was still in chaos, so that was out of the question.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the downgrader shouted, as he controlled the array plate in front of him.</p>

  <p>The entire plate was then enveloped in a red light.</p>

  <p>What happened next was exactly the opposite of what he wanted.</p>

  <p>While he could control the extending speed of the needle, reduce the extending speed to zero, and even force the needle to shrink back, he couldn't change the direction of the needle.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the huge stress contained in the needle from having been twisted was outside his control.</p>

  <p>As a result, he wasn't able to stop the needle.</p>

  <p>To his horror, the needle continued heading towards the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Crack! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The collision made a deafeningly thunderous noise.</p>

  <p>One of the three corners of the Burial Land had been smashed into smithereens.</p>

  <p>Inside this corner was a huge space, where countless Troubled Creatures lived. They had been clamoring and raising their morale, as they were preparing to join the upcoming war.</p>

  <p>But before the real war had even started, the skies began to crumble before them.</p>

  <p>Broken pieces of the sky, together with a huge silver creature, fell to the earth. The Troubled Creatures were swept away in the blink of an eye; they didn't even have the time to scream.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Burial Land was originally in a stagnant state, but once one of its corners was hit, the remaining kinetic energy pushed itself to spin.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, after colliding into the Burial Land's corner, that specific curved part of the needle instantly straightened out and did not cause any further damage.</p>

  <p>However, there were many other curved parts of the needle that were still moving irregularly, trying to straighten out.</p>

  <p>On the jadeite platform, Zheng and his companions were dumbfounded as they watched this scene unfold before them.</p>

  <p>Although Hilario had expected this, even he was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God...</p>

  <p>Was this his plan from the very beginning? This is horrible!</p>

  <p>He is gambling his own life," the Snake Goddess said, her eyebrows furrowing deeply.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't spare any time to speak. He focused on controlling the primitive land, avoiding the needle as best as he could.</p>

  <p>A fifth of the Burial Land had been destroyed after one of its corners was hit. If it was hit by the needle head-on, it was doomed.</p>

  <p>The same went for Zheng's primitive land; unfortunately, it was so vast that it was hard to navigate in such a way that they could avoid the needle completely.</p>

  <p>As the primitive land moved slowly, the needle whipped around violently.</p>

  <p>Then, its bent head shot in the primitive land's direction at a frightening speed.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the jadeite platform raised their heads in unison.</p>

  <p>A huge tear appeared on the blood red sky, as if a pair of scissors had cut open the blood red cloth, revealing the chaos outside.</p>

  <p>It seemed the huge needle had shot forward enough to pierce through the primitive land's skies, but it had stopped there and whipped back.</p>

  <p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>If the needle had hacked down any further, the primitive land would have been split in half. They were lucky it had left only a wound.</p>

  <p>Now, the needle was heading towards the Source World at an even faster speed. Fortunately, it stopped in its tracks again, and whipped backwards, towards the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>In the black hall, the Evil God buried his face in his hands and began to laugh hysterically.</p>

  <p>His shrill laughter echoed in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>When faced with this undefeatable opponent, the Evil God had decided to unleash utter chaos, to even out the playing field.</p>

  <p>While that was his plan, it was also a gamble.</p>

  <p>Seeing the needle coming straight for him once more, the downgrader was consumed with fury.</p>

  <p>If this was a game of luck, why wasn't luck on his side?</p>

  <p>Right now, if the needle hit the Burial Land, it would probably be completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw!" the downgrader said wisely. He had grown quick witted in the face of danger. He controlled the array plate to force the needle to retract.</p>

  <p>Then, he watched as the needle shrank rapidly. Just as it was about to lash at the Burial Land, it shrank to a size that completely missed the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Now, it was shooting towards the opposite direction once more.</p>

  <p>"It's time for you to die." The downgrader laughed maniacally.</p>

  <p>The Source World was right in the needle's path.</p>

  <p>The downgrader controlled the array plate to make the needle grow rapidly again.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The needle turned into an unimaginably huge metal whip that was lashing towards the Source World. The Source World at this point was like a fragile egg that was about to be smashed with a stone.</p>
