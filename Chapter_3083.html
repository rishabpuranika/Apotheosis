<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Flag Master was preoccupied, wondering what Luo Zheng's words meant, when suddenly a piercing bright light interrupted his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, he instantly raised his hand, summoning a long sword to parry Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a warrior at the second stage of the Other Shore Realm, and had been training in the Dragon City for a long time. Fergus entrusting him with guarding the store indicated he was a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>"Ding, Ding, Ding...!"</p>

  <p>"Dragon-Snake Dancing Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>The long sword in the Flag Master's hand writhed and coiled around his body, protecting him from the scattered sword radiance from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Flag Master's expression grew serious. He had summoned his strongest swordsmanship, and yet, he could feel that it was only a matter of time before Luo Zheng's fragmented sword radiance would pierce his defenses.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth, arms trembling with every blow.</p>

  <p>'Why is he so powerful?' He winced at another powerful blow. 'He has just reached the first stage of the Other Shore Realm!'</p>

  <p>"Will you be able to defend yourself?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed coldly, his sword radiance shooting towards the Flag Master unrelentingly.</p>

  <p>The Flag Master struggled to resist, beads of sweat streaming down his face. He knew he was at his limit. His eyes darted around, desperately looking for a solution to this mess.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" It was too late.</p>

  <p>The sword exploded into tiny fragments, scattered into the wind.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>The white sword radiance pierced his body. He barely had the time to react.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, an arm and a leg were torn clean off his body.</p>

  <p>The Flag Master locked eyes with Luo Zheng in shocked awe before he collapsed to the ground. How could he, a Flag Master at the second stage of the Other Shore Realm, not even last five minutes in a battle with this Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>The Flag Master bit back tears. 'I'm going to die here, ' he thought miserably, as Luo Zheng slowly approached his pitiful figure. However, to his surprise, Luo Zheng walked past him, as though he didn't even notice the injured figure bleeding on the ground.</p>

  <p>'Did he let me go?' The Flag Master gasped, unable to keep the tears from streaming down his face.</p>

  <p>Only then did he remember what Luo Zheng had said.</p>

  <p>It was true that he didn't kill the two men today. Luo Zheng had spared his life, although leaving him severely injured.</p>

  <p>When he pondered over this, he felt a sense of gratitude well up from within him.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you destroy our Master Furgus' store? Brat, you're courting death!" two other Flag Masters roared from the other side of the street, shaking their fists.</p>

  <p>Immediately, they drew their swords and charged towards Luo Zheng, their eyes red from rage.</p>

  <p>As he saw the two men approaching, Luo Zheng's expression remained stoic.</p>

  <p>A white light flashed on the Snow Sword. The previously messy sword radiance had obviously changed. It had just been slow and dispersed, but now it was quick and converging.</p>

  <p>It all happened in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Plop..."</p>

  <p>Before the two Flag Masters could even reach Luo Zheng, they collapsed in the middle of the street.</p>

  <p>Monica gasped slightly, unable to contain her shock.</p>

  <p>The three Flag Masters were by no means weak. Although Monica was confident that she could take on at least one of them, there was no possible way that she'd be able to fight all three at once.</p>

  <p>However, against Luo Zheng, these three Flag Masters fell before him, one by one!</p>

  <p>'This guy has just broken through to the Other Shore Realm...'</p>

  <p>It was undeniable that some gaps couldn't be narrowed in time.</p>

  <p>Monica scratched her forehead, deep in thought. She had noticed that the sword token Luo Zheng used was the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Monica knew this because she was the one who accompanied Luo Zheng when he bought it, which happened fairly recently.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng use this swordsmanship so expertly and powerfully if he had only cultivated it for a short period of time?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a silence had fallen over the market, as everyone was stunned by Luo Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>Many had gathered to watch, curious as to how Luo Zheng would resolve this matter.</p>

  <p>Little did they know that Luo Zheng would unleash this much power on those poor three Flag Masters.</p>

  <p>Nobody dared utter a word, fearful that Luo Zheng might turn against them in his rage. They just quietly watched the injured bodies writhe in blood on the pavement.</p>

  <p>'Just who is this guy?' everyone wondered.</p>

  <p>Although they had witnessed Luo Zheng's power, they couldn't help being worried about him. Fergus was a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>How was Luo Zheng going to clean up this mess? How would Fergus deal with him?</p>

  <p>No matter he could take it or not, Luo Zheng had helped those disciples of Sword Light Palace vent their frustration.</p>

  <p>The Sword-reading Liquid was not only owned by Fergus' store. Since their Flag Master could make it, then there was no reason to forbid them from selling it. It was too domineering for them to hurt these disciples.</p>

  <p>Gant too was struck with a mix of shock and awe. He realized that everything Luo Zheng told him in the Sword Tower was not just empty boasts.</p>

  <p>Yet, he was still filled with worry.</p>

  <p>The one who intimidated him was not Fergus, but the person commanding him.</p>

  <p>"Go back and tell your Alliance Chief to come to me if you have any problems. If you attack my people again, I won't go easy next time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave one last satisfied look at the scene, then turned and left with Kenelm and the others.</p>

  <p>Upon Luo Zheng's exit, life gradually began to return to the quiet marketplace.</p>

  <p>The three Flag Masters who were writhing on the ground moaned for help.</p>

  <p>The people immediately rushed to them, bringing medicines and bandages.</p>

  <p>Others began to whisper amongst themselves, discussing feverishly what they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Phoenix Restaurant of the Dragon City, several women twirled and threw their heads back, their heavy locks bouncing with every movement. With seductive smiles, these sirens sang to the audience sweetly.</p>

  <p>Among the audience were some Alliance Chiefs.</p>

  <p>One of them had a small jade token hanging from his belt. Upon a closer look, one would see the 'Taiyi' symbol engraved on it? it was the Taiyi Token gifted to every Taiyi Guard.</p>

  <p>Everyone who came to the Dragon City dreamt of earning this small jade token.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Ioan!" someone bellowed with hearty laughter. "Finally, you've been promoted to a Taiyi Guard! And through only one assessment! Your life here in the Dragon City is coming to an end. Ahh..."</p>

  <p>Fergus trailed off sentimentally. Holding a glass of wine in one hand, Fergus offered a toast to Ioan.</p>

  <p>Ioan smiled modestly. "Becoming the Taiyi Guard is but the beginning of my hardship. Unrest broke out again in the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Last month, a hundred Taiyi Guards lost their lives while trying to keep the peace. If these riots continue, I'm afraid all the newly-promoted Taiyi Guards will die, too..."</p>

  <p>Although the Taiyi Heaven Palace was considered a prosperous force, it still faced a lot of pressure in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>"After I leave," Ioan suddenly said seriously, "could you please take care of my old friend?" He gestured at an elderly man, who sat next to him, Galen.</p>

  <p>Ioan was planning to leave the rest of his merit points to Galen once he left the Dragon City. This way, Galen could replace him and be appointed the new Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>Galen, who was usually a sour-faced character, quickly smiled and held up his glass of wine. "I would appreciate your help in the future," he said modestly, toasting with the Alliance Chiefs.</p>

  <p>When it came to Fergus, Galen's tone softened as he tried to emulate more humility. "I would greatly appreciate your help, Master Fergus."</p>

  <p>Galen could care less about the other Alliance Chiefs. Fergus, however, came from a prominent background. He was sure that befriending such an Alliance Chief would prove beneficial to him in the future.</p>

  <p>However, before their glasses could clink, a person came rushing over to Fergus. Out of breath and panting, the messenger could barely spit out the words, "Master Fergus... I have... news...!"</p>

  <p>"What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?" Fergus asked anxiously, his brows furrowing.</p>

  <p>"Master Fergus, someone smashed our store outside the Dragon City!" He gasped for breath. "He even destroyed about a hundred bottles of Sword-reading Liquid..." the man shuddered as though he were remembering something gruesome.</p>

  <p>"What? Who did it?" Fergus demanded.</p>

  <p>He felt a chill run down his spine, extending to his arms and flowing to his fingertips. The glass of wine he was holding frosted over, the wine turning into ice pellets.</p>

  <p>The women who had been singing and dancing suddenly stopped and shivered slightly.</p>

  <p>"His name," the messenger replied, eyes widening in fear, "is  Luo Zheng Luo..."</p>

  <p>The Alliance Chiefs exchanged confused glances, wondering, 'Who is  Luo Zheng Luo?'</p>

  <p>Fergus scratched his chin. He had never heard of this name before. Just as he was wondering why such a nobody would dare smash his store, Galen snorted. "I was wondering who would have the gall to oppose you. It's Luo Zheng again!"</p>
