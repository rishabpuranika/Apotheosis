  <p>
</p>

  <p>The lightning released from?Leo gradually dissipated, and his life energy faded away. At the same time, the changes to Leo's body were clearly visible.</p>

  <p>His skin had wrinkled, and his hair had turned grey. Leo, who was in his twenties, looked like an older man, aged thirty or forty.</p>

  <p>The Raging Holy Thunder was extremely powerful and overbearing, and its terrible power would turn against the cultivator. Zheng was astonished when he saw the changes on Leo.</p>

  <p>The audience around the battle ring stared at Zheng with a fearful expression. To them, it seemed as if he were a horrid, cruel man.</p>

  <p>This man had been a member of Drizzle Peak?for less than a month. He defeated Leo, who was ranked 30th among the outer disciples. The incredible fight and Leo's ultimate defeat had happened in front of them.</p>

  <p>What was more shocking was that Zheng was only at the organ refining level.</p>

  <p>In time, once he entered the marrow refining level, or perhaps he took a half step into the nature level, wouldn't he be able to challenge a master at the nature level? Zheng's power was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Although no one spoke, they were all in awe of what Zheng had accomplished.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether this assumption was true or not, Zheng's strength was far superior to any other disciple at the same level. It was an established fact. No one could deny that.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Leo had been defeated, and having borne witness to what had happened to Leo, Anthony He was furious. He felt restless, as though he needed to do something. He suddenly stretched out his right hand and roared at Nory with a crisp, authoritative tone, "Return the Purple Blue Sword to me!"</p>

  <p>Not long ago, they gambled for the fight, that the winner could take the bet. Then Anthony gave his Purple Blue Sword, which was a top grade mysterious weapon, as a bet to Nory. And also Zheng handed his bet, hundreds of cubic crystals, to Nory. At that time, Anthony was certain that Leo would not lose. So, he lent the Purple Blue Sword to Leo without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>After all, the risk in this gamble was minimal. Anthony knew of Leo's skills, and he figured this battle would be an easy win for Leo. Of course, he would be happy to see that his Purple Blue Sword would bring him fifty pieces of cubic crystals after Leo won this battle. It seemed like a very safe bet at that time. He would have been a fool not to bet against Zheng.</p>

  <p>The result, however, was unexpected. Anthony was dumbfounded at Zheng's victory.</p>

  <p>The risk Anthony had taken blew up in his face. However, Anthony was too angry to care about any other things. He needed to get the Purple Blue Sword back. The sword belonged to him and he would not see it go to another person!</p>

  <p>Anthony's gaze was fixed on the Purple Blue Sword and Nory. Nory was a little nervous. He took two steps back in surprise, but he did not retreat.</p>

  <p>Then, he said stiffly, "Isn't the sword part of the bet? You've made a bet with your sword. Now that Leo has lost, the top grade mysterious weapon belongs to Zheng."</p>

  <p>"This is my weapon. I just lent it to Leo. I don't care if Zheng won or lost!</p>

  <p>You want a mysterious weapon, then ask Leo!" A top grade mysterious weapon was a precious object for outer disciples. Reasoning did not seem to work with Anthony. His only thought was to get his weapon back.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly stepped forward and grabbed the sword. Then he turned to Anthony and said, "This is what I won from Leo. If you want it back, I suggest you ask Leo!"</p>

  <p>"No. The Purple Blue Sword is..." Anthony began countering Zheng's argument. However, he got anxious and couldn't finish.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at Anthony with cold eyes and said, "Well, If you don't accept your loss, I shall have to use force!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words shut Anthony up.</p>

  <p>Anthony was also talented. He ranked 35th among the outer disciples.</p>

  <p>However, Leo, who was ranked in the 30th place, had been defeated by Zheng. How could Anthony afford to compete with Zheng? Did he have a chance to win?</p>

  <p>No, he didn't. Anthony could only stay quiet at Zheng's threat. However, he couldn't let go of his sword. It seemed that he could only vent his anger at Leo.</p>

  <p>Thomas Zhu, who had been watching the battle, shook his head when he saw that Leo had been defeated. He whispered, "Crap," and then turned away.</p>

  <p>Before he stepped away, a sword plunged into the ground in front of Thomas. The?Purple Blue Sword swayed in front of Thomas, blocking his way.</p>

  <p>"Was it you who incited Leo to challenge me?" asked Zheng as he strolled toward Thomas. He placed himself in front of Thomas and stared coldly at him.</p>

  <p>Thomas chuckled, "So what? What are you going to do? I am from the Zhuge Clan. Can anyone here afford to offend the Zhuge family? My master sentenced you to death. And so, you should die. I am here to make sure you die quickly. I suggest you write your last words and prepare for the funeral before it's too late!"</p>

  <p>"Zhuge Clan? Who are you in the Zhuge family?" Zheng ignored Thomas' outburst and asked.</p>

  <p>"Me?" The fat on Thomas' face shook, and his smile grew even more confident. "It doesn't hurt to tell you. I am a close servant of the third son of the Zhuge Clan."</p>

  <p>"The third son of the Zhuge Clan? The third son of the Zhuge Clan is involved in this matter?"</p>

  <p>"When did Zheng provoke the Zhuge family? The third son is a madman!"</p>

  <p>Someone in the crowd said. Then, the others started to talk about it.</p>

  <p>Apparently, many people present had heard about the notorious third son.</p>
