<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Choosing to engage in close combat with Luo Zheng was a big mistake.</p>

  <p>Sure, the little monster's body was indeed very special. He was virtually unmatched in terms of power and strength in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Physical combat could be considered his forte and any fight that required brute strength would always work out in his favor.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he met Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite being unmatched in the four divine kingdoms, the little monster could never have hoped to compare to Zheng's strength. Not even a mighty Soul Sea Realm warrior would be able to withstand a punch from the young man.</p>

  <p>To add to that, Zheng's body had also just become a sacred weapon. An ordinary sacred weapon such as a saber or a sword could not compare to an entire human body in terms of width and physical attributes. Zheng's body, therefore, was naturally stronger than any sacred saber or sword.</p>

  <p>There was no way the little monster would be able to injure Luo Zheng in melee combat.</p>

  <p>There was no sugarcoating it. The little monster's choice led him to his own doom.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, War Emperor York stewed in anger as he watched the fight.</p>

  <p>Zheng's strike would've no doubt injured the little monster badly, but the war emperor remained silent and did nothing to stop the battle. He knew how tough the little monster was. He wouldn't die so easily.</p>

  <p>Both War Emperor York and Marine had placed their hopes upon the little monster. They needed him to kill Luo Zheng. Any intervention from his part would mean admitting defeat for the little monster, and that was far from what he wanted.</p>

  <p>It was just that the little monster had been too arrogant. The decision to fight Luo Zheng using only brute strength, without any use of life vitality, was terribly stupid. The little monster brought this upon himself and it made War Emperor York terribly angry. According to Marine, Luo Zheng was a very capable fighter. He had managed to kill a fourth-level Life and Death Realm warrior, and even both Master Abraham and Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>However, War Emperor York remained skeptical. Luo Zheng couldn't have possibly killed Master Wallace and Master Abraham though he suspected that their deaths might still be related to the young man.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's onslaught of attacks continued and each strike that landed on the little monster made the expression on War Emperor York's face grow darker.</p>

  <p>The other warriors watching, however, were the opposite. They, in fact, felt happy at the scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>The little monster had a less than amicable reputation among them. He was a notorious character who did all sorts of evil things. Had he been born as a divine kingdom crown prince, he would've long since been dethroned.</p>

  <p>He was someone who generated a lot of hate from the people around him, but nobody could really afford to offend him due to his strength.</p>

  <p>The only way to deal with the little monster was to outright avoid him.</p>

  <p>The Nine Furnace Martial House warriors were especially happy seeing the little monster be brutally abused by Luo Zheng. It was like the New Year's celebration for them but five times better. They felt that Luo Zheng was helping them vent out their frustrations upon the little monster through his constant tirade of attacks. It was a strangely cathartic experience for all of them.</p>

  <p>Fiona, who had since returned to the top of the stairs, also liked what she saw. The little monster's current predicament was proof that evil, did in fact, bounce back.</p>

  <p>Fiona also had her share of bad memories with him. In the past, her father, War King Wind, had brought her to the York Divine Kingdom to spar with the little monster. She wasn't really someone who left her kingdom's training grounds so the battle with the little monster was initiated in the hopes of helping her achieve a faster breakthrough.</p>

  <p>The little monster had just entered the Internal Elixir Realm, and he had been full of obscenities during the match. His attacks almost injured Fiona, which made War King Wind extremely angry to the point that he was ready to end the little monster's life. It was only because of War Emperor York that her father spared him.</p>

  <p>The experience did help Fiona break through the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, but it left her traumatized. The little monster's horrible image was something she brought back with her to the Wind Divine Kingdom to endure for the better part of a year.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that a sweet, kind princess such as Fiona utterly feared and hated the little monster.</p>

  <p>She felt the exact opposite with Luo Zheng. She greatly admired the young man.</p>

  <p>Warriors usually worshiped people stronger than them after all.</p>

  <p>Fiona was no exception. She also worshiped many people, but all of them were seniors.</p>

  <p>Besides the little monster, nobody had caught her attention within their generation. Even the crown prince's strength was far more inferior to hers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, or Tianxing as she had come to know him, was different and unexpectedly impressed her with his abilities.</p>

  <p>She was immediately intrigued by him after his match with Logan. That was the reason why she requested her father to arrange a match between the two of them.</p>

  <p>Fiona rarely had any interest with sparring, but Luo Zheng piqued her interest.</p>

  <p>War King Wind also doted heavily on his daughter so of course he arranged the match for her.</p>

  <p>Her loss left her feeling quite complicated. Now that she had fought with him, there was that itching feeling within her that wanted to know more about this mysterious young man.</p>

  <p>A lot of questions ran in her mind. Who was his master? How was he able to become so strong? Was he really from the Sky Northern Region?</p>

  <p>How could such a talent like him come from such a small place? These questions ran through her head all the time ever since. She needed to know more about him.</p>

  <p>But of course, she could not forget her place. Fiona was a dignified princess of a divine kingdom, and she couldn't just bombard Luo Zheng with her questions all at once. She had to be subtle and thus, resigned herself to watching him from a distance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had swung the little monster hard towards the enchanted barrier. Just as he did, a sharp pain shot through his hands that made him lose his grip on his opponent.</p>

  <p>The little monster's two long arms quickly shrank back and returned to their original state. Now that Luo Zheng had let go of him, he finally began to use his life vitality and floated onto the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scoffed and followed his opponent up in the air, "I thought you wouldn't use your life vitality."</p>

  <p>"I underestimated you," the little monster admitted frankly.</p>

  <p>There was a slight hint of shame in the little monster's tone. Although he possessed an almost immortal body, Zheng's earlier abuse had left him a bit dispirited especially after his blatant display of arrogance at the start of the match.</p>

  <p>Still, that did not mean that he was an easy opponent. Luo Zheng himself was actually quite amazed at his opponent's resistance to attacks.</p>

  <p>The little monster's body was the strongest Luo Zheng had ever seen. It was only second to his own.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had once said that Zheng's treasure body was probably unique in this universe, but it was only one of the many wonders that existed in their world. There were so many more unique things in the universe, and the little monster was perhaps another one of them.</p>

  <p>The little monster had grown up in an unforgiving forest filled with all sorts of vicious beasts. His savage nature, a product of the environment he had grown up in, always got the best of him. He was arrogant, aggressive, and he was never that serious when facing his opponents.</p>

  <p>He was a wild thing but after being groomed by the Nine Furnace Martial House, the little monster began to realize his goal, and that was to kill off all the Soul Sea Realm experts in the Divine Kingdom Continent. Why? So that he could turn it into his own world!</p>

  <p>It sounded far-fetched but the little monster believed wholeheartedly in his dream.</p>

  <p>Why would War Emperor York train him? So that he could get stronger and then use his talent to help the warriors break through. However, his experience with the Nine Furnace Martial House had effectively sown the seeds of hatred for all martial artists in his heart. There was only room for revenge in the little monster's mind.</p>

  <p>Before he was strong enough, however, he knew he had to patiently endure. The reason why he had been unable to break through the Virtual Tribulation Realm was that he was suppressing his own cultivation.</p>

  <p>He knew that once he broke through and entered the Life and Death Realm, he would be able to affect these Soul Sea Realm masters and help them attain a higher level. This was far from what he wanted. There was no way he was helping his enemies get stronger, so he chose to suppress himself in the hopes that he could break through the Virtual Tribulation Realm and instantly reach the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>This was the only way he'd stand a chance against the Soul Sea Realm powerhouses.</p>

  <p>For the little monster, the requirement he set for himself was to be able to fight someone who was an entire realm higher than him. He was currently at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but he could face off against a fifth or even sixth-level Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Once he broke through, he should be able to attain the third or even fourth level of the Life and Death Realm which would be enough to face off against Soul Sea Realm masters. He wouldn't be able to defeat War Emperor York, but it would be enough for him to escape the Divine Kingdom Continent. It was only once he got strong enough that he would come back for revenge.</p>

  <p>However, his plans had come crashing down upon meeting this other "monster." Tianxing's cultivation level was lower than his, but he was by no means any weaker than him.</p>

  <p>He had greatly underestimated his opponent before, but now, the little monster knew that he had to take this fight seriously. He finally activated his life vitality and let it flow throughout his body, concentrating it on his hands.</p>

  <p>A speck of golden light sparked in his palm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but frown at this speck of life vitality as it gave off a very strange feeling that he couldn't describe.</p>

  <p>It was as if the golden life vitality contained some kind of strange, complex rule.</p>

  <p>"No wonder you can't kill him," Xun said. She was also unable to determine the little monster's origins before, but the sight of the golden life vitality in his palm confirmed something for her. "This guy isn't a monster, but he isn't exactly human either. He is the son of the plane."</p>
