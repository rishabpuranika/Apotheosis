<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1042 Confiding In Yan (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The short lives of those two siblings were to be full of misfortunes. It was as if it was written in the stars that they had to go through such so that they might serve their true purpose.</p>

  <p>Ever since they got older, the chance to stay together became rare.</p>

  <p>Whenever they had an opportunity to be with one another, an obstacle came each time.</p>

  <p>Martial cultivators could keep growing stronger because of their natural advantage and unique luck, but it was almost impossible for them to escape their fate.</p>

  <p>Just like what others had told Luo Zheng, Yan was his ultimate guide in life. Every step that he took had a purpose that was related to her. Their lives were connected.</p>

  <p>When he was still in the Luo Clan, Luo Zheng had always intended to head to the Cloud Sect in search for his sister. After he successfully located her, his next objective was to save her. Because of his excellence as a disciple, he was able to take her away from the Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, after a short period of reunion, they had been separated once again for several years. They never saw each other since.</p>

  <p>All of Yan's six senses had been blocked, so she didn't have much clue what was happening around her� not even the passing of time. Her memory had also stopped processing new thoughts and absorbing new ones two years ago.</p>

  <p>Back then, she despaired for the most part.</p>

  <p>The only thought that stuck with her, for the most part, was if her brother could really save her from Eddie.</p>

  <p>It was without question that Luo Zheng was extremely talented, but he was in the Eastern Region. Her brother had fought formidable opponents in the Eastern Region, but the Central Region had their own ferocious talents. For her, defeating Eddie was going to be a challenge for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yan fell asleep with all the thoughts still swimming inside her head. Zheng's face was the last thing she was expecting to see the moment she woke up.</p>

  <p>The spirals in her black pupils rotated slowly as they expressed great joy upon staring at his brother who was now right in front of her.</p>

  <p>Unable to contain the joy he felt upon seeing his sister, Luo Zheng extended out his arms and pulled Yan's thin and slender body into a tight embrace.</p>

  <p>A familiar warmth enveloped Yan's heart as she rested her head on Zheng's chest. However, she still had her doubts about the situation. Did Luo Zheng really come to save her, or did he only make an agreement with Eddie so they could meet? How did Luo Zheng even find her?</p>

  <p>"Brother, where is Eddie?" hesitation was evident in Yan's voice as she asked. It only meant that she also feared the answer to her own question.</p>

  <p>Maybe Luo Zheng only came to visit, and her fate was still the same. Still stuck, still alone.</p>

  <p>However, she was also a determined martial cultivator, and she knew that there were some problems that would eventually come her way in the end.</p>

  <p>No matter what, she knew she had to be brave.</p>

  <p>"I killed him," Luo Zheng whispered softly into her ear.</p>

  <p>"But, brother," Yan's voice trembled in both shock and disbelief.</p>

  <p>"It's true. I killed him with my own hands," Luo Zheng said as he stroked Yan's hair. Although her six senses had been blocked in the past two years, she still grew. She was taller than she was before. However, her figure was clearly thinner, and her black hair was lackluster. Luo Zheng was distressed to see how weak she was.</p>

  <p>Not even bothering to hide her disbelief, Yan pursed her lips. She sighed deeply, trying her best to collect her thoughts.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's sister, she trusted her brother's words unconditionally. However, what he had just spoken of wasn't that easy to accept.</p>

  <p>Truly, it was hard to believe. Unless people were able to witness such a thing, it was merely a lie. Something like that wasn't just a story you could tell without proof.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Zheng quite a short time to achieve such brilliance that he possessed.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, he was only a nature-level warrior, then entered the Illuminating Soul Realm only two years ago. In just two short years, he was able to build himself like that. It was quite hard to comprehend for anyone, even his own sister.</p>

  <p>If they were to be compared to him and his achievements, had all the efforts of those warriors who lived hundreds of years been wasted?</p>

  <p>Did all the efforts exerted by the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance go to waste?</p>

  <p>Those were the questions that added up to Yan's refusal to believe what she had just been told.</p>

  <p>It was the Central Region, not the Eastern Region. But Luo Zheng had still managed to do something on unfamiliar grounds that no one else ever did.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yan's shocked expression, Luo Zheng smiled softly. In a serious tone, he reassured, "I will never lie to you. Eddie is dead, really dead this time. And it was I who killed him."</p>

  <p>"I believe you!" Yan responded firmly. Since Luo Zheng had already confirmed it, how could she doubt her brother? He said it himself, he wasn't lying to her and he never could.</p>

  <p>For some reason, she couldn't help but worry. She asked, "Then�</p>

  <p>Will you get me out of this place?"</p>

  <p>If Eddie really was dead, then she had finally regained her freedom. She could return to her brother's side safe and sound and without any more obstacles. Her mind hadn't stopped working despite all her blocked senses.</p>

  <p>While she was imprisoned in the world where only her consciousness existed, she had always looked forward to the very day her brother came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shook his head and said no.</p>

  <p>The expression on Yan's face shifted quickly. Raising her voice by a notch, she asked, "Why?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng turned his head and asked, "Can't you give me a little more time?"</p>
