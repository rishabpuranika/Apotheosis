<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fat man swung the long stick in his hand. Its tip began to glow a blue light as another frost mark, much like the one on Zheng's back, appeared on it.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming again. Are you ready?" The fatty laughed, his chubby cheeks and double chin shaking.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's ranking had improved drastically in the Hall of True Gods, he estimated that he wouldn't encounter too many difficulties at this stage.</p>

  <p>However, after meeting this fat man, Luo Zheng figured he should probably stop underestimating his enemy.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fatty finished speaking, he waved the long stick he held wildly and charged towards Luo Zheng like a raging bull.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's mild surprise, the man stopped about a foot from him and turned into a flurry of snowflakes.</p>

  <p>"Behind me again?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and launched a punch without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he guessed wrong again. The snowflakes behind him had condensed into the fatty who didn't waste time in hitting Zheng's back with his stick.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Zheng's back now had two frost marks overlapping like a tattoo.</p>

  <p>"I heard you are strong and that you have a special body protection treasure.</p>

  <p>With my current strength, it'll be quite difficult to kill you," the fat man admitted before turning into a pile of snow that melted as soon as it appeared. A hundred feet from Luo Zheng, a flurry of snowflakes turned into the fat man once again. The fatty tilted his head. "But there are many different ways to kill people. I'm sure I can use another way..."</p>

  <p>Then, he waved his stick again and stomped heavily on the ice.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Six piles of snow suddenly appeared around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Break them all!"</p>

  <p>Quick to react, Luo Zheng spun his arms in all directions like wheels, causing an invisible force to leave his body and blow the snow away.</p>

  <p>However, the snow collected in the air and morphed into several fatties, all charging at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately felt a headache seeing this scene.</p>

  <p>This fatty's bodily movement skill was too weird.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for a low-rank True God to move in a flash, but Luo Zheng was unable to recognize which fatty was real and which ones were fake.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the fatty's clones were made of real snowflakes and not just virtual shadows.</p>

  <p>Seeing the six fatties pouncing on him, Luo Zheng threw six punches in a flash.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>He succeeded in punching all the six fatties.</p>

  <p>But the moment he destroyed all six snowmen, Luo Zheng felt a faint force behind him.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>The long stick hit Zheng's back and left yet another frost mark.</p>

  <p>"Three frost marks won't be enough. While you're just a proving godly warrior, your comprehensive ability is much greater than that of an ordinary low-rank True God," said the fatty. "To defeat you, I'll need four frost marks."</p>

  <p>The fear Luo Zheng felt was even greater now. He didn't want the ten consecutive wins he had accumulated through hard work to come to an end.</p>

  <p>If the frost marks were to explode, Luo Zheng had no idea whether he'd be able to resist it. But he didn't want to take the risk, so he rushed over to the fatty while he spoke.</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng run towards him, the fat man opened his arms as if he was trying for a hug.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's fist made contact with the fatty, a strange smile suddenly appeared on Zheng's face. "It's not the real you," he said before turning to the other direction. Luo Zheng had guessed that the fat man in front of him was just a pile of snow. Pulling back his arm, Luo Zheng threw his fist as hard as he could and punched. "It's here!"</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there was nothing but the void. Luo Zheng scowled as he heard the fatty's voice behind him. "Nice try, but sadly, you guessed wrong again."</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng felt a light tap on his back. His eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The fourth frost mark had been made!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The snowflakes were still falling.</p>

  <p>The fatty's voice was heard from a distance, "You're not as powerful as I've heard. Recently, everyone's been talking about how powerful the anonymous man is, and some people even predicted that you'd win twenty consecutive battles. I never imagined you were this weak! This battle... I will be the winner!"</p>

  <p>He then reached out his fat hands to frame Luo Zheng within his fingers, a glimmer of excitement flashing in his eyes. "In fact, I haven't seen a spear with four layers of snow marks in a long time, because normally, my opponents would have already been defeated before I could even launch a fourth one."</p>

  <p>As he said this, the frost marks on Zheng's back shone faintly.</p>

  <p>A huge snowflake pattern which probably contained some kind of powerful attack appeared not far behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A light blue ice spear shot out from it and zoomed towards Luo Zheng at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>It was so fast that Luo Zheng could not dodge at all.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the power of this Snow Divine Spear was not that terrifying.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng couldn't dodge, his body was able to bear the force.</p>

  <p>"So the rumor is true. Your body really is much stronger than those monsters. Usually, a low-rank True God will be injured after facing the first layer of the Snow Divine Spear," the fat man mused. "The second Snow Divine Spear..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A second icy spear shot out of the huge snowflake.</p>

  <p>This icy spear seemed purer and stronger than the first one. It was azure blue, as beautiful as the sky, and contained a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>By this time, Luo Zheng had already understood that the latter Snow Divine Spear would be stronger than the former one.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, Luo Zheng immediately shot an invisible long sword towards the second icy spear.</p>

  <p>Strangely, Zheng's long sword passed through the Snow Divine Spear as if it didn't exist and Luo Zheng was unable to block it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The second icy spear hit Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Although the Redemption Armor protected his body, the impact of the second icy spear spread on his body and made his blood roll. Luckily, Luo Zheng was still able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>"Not bad! Your clothes are truly something! It should have blocked most of the power, right?" The fatty chuckled.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As fatty talked, the third Snow Divine Spear shot from the snowflake pattern again. This Snow Divine Spear had turned a blue black color, and the tip of the icy spear rotated with flowing light continuously.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried his best to dodge but failed, the third icy spear hitting him.</p>

  <p>Shards of ice fell everywhere. Luo Zheng slid down the icy ground and spat a lot of blood. The powerful force spread through his body, injuring his internal organs.</p>

  <p>"What tenacity indeed," the fatty clicked his tongue twice and shook his head. "With the fourth spear, I shall end your life."</p>

  <p>The fat man only cultivated to the forth level of the Snow Divine Spear which was the theurgy beyond the Snow Godly Way.</p>

  <p>After defending his opponent, he only needed to leave three frost marks on his opponent with the mystical snow steps, then the battle would be as good as over.</p>

  <p>However, there were just some monsters who were too stubborn to die.</p>

  <p>The fatty had once fought with Pascal, and Pascal also withstood the first two spears. The third spear was the most lethal one but since Pascal managed to dodge it, the fatty had lost the battle.</p>

  <p>This time, the fatty had prepared four spears and he really took Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The fourth Snow Divine Spear shot out of the snowflake pattern.</p>

  <p>However, unlike the previous ones, this spear was completely black.</p>

  <p>Those who forced the fatty to show the fourth Snow Divine Spear all lost pathetically.</p>
