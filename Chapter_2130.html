<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Master Evil left the Swirl Forest, he noticed a large group of vicious beasts. The beasts frantically rushed towards the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Although he and Wayne were powerful, if they really were to be surrounded by that group of ferocious beasts, then the odds were against them. Such dangerous beasts would give them a hard time and probably even severe injuries…</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that the vicious beasts only glanced at the two of them for a brief moment and then ignored them. It seemed like that the beasts considered them unimportant.</p>

  <p>After the beasts had left, Master Evil and Wayne then quietly left the Swirl Forest. As they finally safely escaped the forest, they both went their separate ways.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had been imprisoned for many divine eras…</p>

  <p>For a True God, seven or eight divine eras wouldn't have too great of a change. Nothing more than two or three new Holy Beings would appear in that period. Additionally, there would only be little changes in the rankings of the Floating Islands on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>However, for the divine citizens, the change was quite significant. The point-of-views of a True God and divine citizens were extremely different.</p>

  <p>When Master Evil returned to the Vast Sky Region, he discovered that the thirty-six islands and seventy-two villages that he had founded had long since been destroyed. All of his creations were already in ruins. The vast majority of them had already disappeared as time passed by.</p>

  <p>He had expected it. However, when he found out that there were three villages left among the seventy-two villages, he felt delighted. After all, those were the inheritance that he had left behind. Additionally, after all those years, there were still many warriors who continuously struggled just to survive.</p>

  <p>It was true that Master Evil had committed many evil deeds. However, he still treasured old friendships. Even though the talent and strength of the warriors that remained were like jokes in the eyes of Master Evil, he still treated them well. He was even prepared to take out some of the things he had hidden in the Vast Sky Region before he slowly regained his power!</p>

  <p>However, there were some things about Master Evil that could not come to light. For example, the thing buried under Misty Mountain Village. He had just returned to the Vast Sky Region, and was just about to regain his ground, so he had to do everything with extreme caution.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the weakness of the people in the Sun Moon Village was beyond his imagination. Their talents and strengths were pathetic. They had even failed to complete a small task like the expulsion of divine citizens. That was not something that Master Evil had expected. A depressed expression came across his face.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the leader of the Sun Moon Village had made a report. In order to conceal his incompetence, he naturally exaggerated about Zheng's abilities. A soul of a world lord was comparable to that of a True God?</p>

  <p>What nonsense!</p>

  <p>In all of his life, Master Evil had only seen one person who had cultivated his soul to such a level. It was that brat Luo Zheng he had met in the fairy palace! A displeased expression immediately showed up in Master Evil's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the disciple of a Holy Being while his father was a Holy Being as well. With a strong foundation and a fantastic master, his cultivation was simply spectacular. In the entire divine land, there weren't many people like him…</p>

  <p>In such a desolate little mountain village in the north of Vast Sky Region, how could there be such a proving godly warrior? He wouldn't believe it anyway.</p>

  <p>"Everything I said was true. If I have told any lies, Master Evil, you can chop off my head. If you don't believe me, you can go there yourself.</p>

  <p>Everything will be made clear!" the leader of the Sun Moon Village said with a serious expression. His eyes reflected no sense of deceit.</p>

  <p>"You imbecile! Are you saying that I have to personally act to drive away some divine citizens?" The voice of Master Evil came again from the Muddy Moon Cave. With an angry tone, he reprimanded the leader of the Sun Moon Village.</p>

  <p>"It's all my fault to have failed to accomplish the task. And this small matter indeed doesn't need you to deal with personally. But the problem is a proving godly warrior. His strength is unrivaled by any of our warriors!" The leader of the Sun Moon Village quickly defended himself.</p>

  <p>He was afraid of Master Evil's wrath.</p>

  <p>In fact, the leader's knowledge of Master Evil came from legends as well. After all, it was not that long after he became a proving godly warrior and started to lead the Sun Moon Village. With his great talents, it was said that he brought prosperity to the Sun Moon Village. Besides, after so many years had passed, the records of Master Evil in the Sun Moon Village became very vague. Nonetheless, just from the title Master Evil, he knew that Master Evil was not some kind person.</p>

  <p>Since the leader of the Sun Moon Village had said so, Master Evil could only sneer. He let out a deep sigh and said angrily, "It seems that I still have to go personally!"</p>

  <p>When the leader of the Sun Moon Village heard this, he was immediately overjoyed. It seemed that Master Evil would not punish him for his incompetence. Additionally, with Master Evil's strength, he only needed to lift a finger to kill that proving godly warrior. The leader also wanted to witness the miserable demise of the proving godly warrior of the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>After the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village confirmed the return of Master Evil, they finally decided to give up on the Misty Mountain Village. Life was above everything. When faced with a True God, or more exactly, a mid-rank True God, they had no way to resist.</p>

  <p>They could only run away helplessly.</p>

  <p>However, at that time, Luo Zheng stepped forward and told them not to leave.</p>

  <p>With a brave expression on his face, he urged everyone to stay.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not tell them any reason. However, he was very confident that their safety could be guaranteed!</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the majority of the people in the Misty Mountain Village didn't believe Luo Zheng. Perhaps Luo Zheng was indeed an extraordinary proving godly warrior, but he was only a world lord. Even his great strength wasn't enough to convince the divine citizens in the Misty Mountain Village. The divine citizens firmly believed that his cultivation level was utterly inferior to that of Master Evil.</p>

  <p>The thousands of divine citizens in Misty Mountain Village began to migrate and hide that day. However, there was still a large portion of the divine citizens that decided to stay. That part of the divine citizens was divided into two types. There were those who were reluctant to leave Misty Mountain Village no matter what would happen. Their possessions and livelihood were already cemented in the village. Another group was those who were led by Woolley and Thomson. It was the group that had chosen to believe in Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the second day, when the first glimmer of light shone, ninety percent of the villagers had already left the Misty Mountain Village. The ten percent that remained readied themselves for another onslaught. Their lives were already in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat formidably at the entrance of the Misty Mountain Village. He continuously cleared the black threads on his cinnabar field as he waited for Master Evil. He was afraid that Master Evil would not show himself and send another group of weak warriors to attack the village again.</p>

  <p>As for the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village that stayed with Luo Zheng, they were even more nervous. Despair crept in each of their hearts.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng couldn't deal with Master Evil, they would die with him!</p>

  <p>Not long after, a group of warriors from the Sun Moon Village came.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was carried in a palanquin that followed behind leisurely.</p>

  <p>After they had climbed over a hill, Master Evil saw the Misty Mountain Village in front of him.</p>

  <p>"It's right in front of us, Master Evil," the leader of the Sun Moon Village reminded Master Evil. "The proving godly warrior should still be guarding the entrance to Misty Mountain Village. His arrogance would be his downfall. With your strength, it would only take a blink of an eye to kill him!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil lazily sat on the palanquin with an indifferent look. Even if what the leader of the Sun Moon Village said was true, the other party was still just a world lord. Such a low-level warrior was not qualified to be his opponent.</p>

  <p>After they crossed the hill, Master Evil and his group finally arrived at the Misty Mountain Village. With a callous expression, Master Evil lazily lay on the palanquin. As he finally stopped, he looked at the direction which the Sun Moon Village's leader pointed. His eyes suddenly widened as he gazed at the entrance of the village. The moment he caught the person at the entrance of the village, Master Evil frantically stood up and revealed a look like he had seen a ghost!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Disbelief painted Master Evil's face. He then used his hand to wipe his eyes, as if to get a better look...</p>

  <p>"Master Evil?" After he saw Master Evil's expression, the leader of the Sun Moon Village was also slightly surprised. Could it be that the proving godly warrior at the entrance of the Misty Mountain Village was indeed someone of great background?</p>

  <p>Master Evil did not answer. He observed for a while and after he confirmed that the warrior was indeed Luo Zheng, he felt conflicted at the moment. His confusion was reflected in his expression. Previously when he left the fairy palace, Master Evil hoped that he would never encounter Luo Zheng again for the rest of his life. After all, the divine land was a huge place, so the chances of another encounter with him were slim. But he didn't expect that he would meet Luo Zheng again so soon. He was really unlucky! All he could do was bite his lips in disappointment.</p>

  <p>He then jumped down from the palanquin and turned around. Without a single word, he left the Misty Mountain Village. The leader of the Sun Moon Village was baffled by the scene. With widened eyes, the leader could only gawk silently.</p>

  <p>However, after Master Evil had taken more than a few steps, he heard Luo Zheng call out to him, "Master Evil, didn't you recognize me?"</p>
