<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the talents of the young generation were eagerly rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the opening of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The various successors of the world lords and the Supreme Lords were all well prepared.</p>

  <p>Some of the hidden supreme divine weapons also changed hands.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm might not be able to use the full strength of the supreme divine weapons, the weapons would help them greatly.</p>

  <p>Thoughtless Minds, Blessed Buddha Land, Humanity Alliance, Celestial Position, Demon Night, ogres, Giants, Saya race...</p>

  <p>All the Soul Sea Realm warriors from every race of the Upper World would enter the Illusion Battlefield within five days.</p>

  <p>Among them, there were some warriors at the Soul Sea Realm who were in dire straits.</p>

  <p>For them, this was also an opportunity to change their fates.</p>

  <p>For example, a Soul Sea Realm warrior who was trapped in a fearful land of a supreme world and couldn't escape even after hundreds of years of struggle and survival.</p>

  <p>However, with the light spot shooting out of the heavens, he could temporarily enter the light spot and avoid the danger in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>The so-called Illusion Battlefield had the same principles as the Illusion Space; the warriors' physical bodies didn't enter the Illusion Battlefield, only their projections did.</p>

  <p>But for these warriors, standing in the shadow of the light spot was tantamount to being protected by the heavens. Therefore, no Soul Sea Realm warrior had to worry about the safety of their physical bodies.</p>

  <p>That simple spot of light meant that the universe had the strictest Law of Causality. Even a Supreme Lord would not be able to break it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a prison in a tenth-grade sacred place of the Demon Night race in a core supreme world, a Demon Night woman's hands were tied to a huge bronze pillar.</p>

  <p>Black raindrops occasionally dripped from the ceiling of the prison.</p>

  <p>These raindrops had an extremely strong corrosive property. They would form a massive crater if they touched the ground. So naturally, if they fell onto a human's body, they would corrode the human's flesh and blood!</p>

  <p>This was an extremely painful punishment for the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Warriors were tied to a bronze pillar and left to rot under the rain. These warriors often had thousands of wounds on their bodies, but even if they were in unbearable pain, they could not choose death. The bronze pillar behind them had a special property as well: the Queen of Life of the Demon Night had personally added the energy of life into it such that after a day of punishment, the bronze pillar would emit strong life energy, causing the Demon Night prisoners to recover completely.</p>

  <p>The woman from the Demon Night endured this punishment day after day, year after year. Whether it was her physical body or soul, she suffered unimaginable torture.</p>

  <p>This woman was none other than Amber.</p>

  <p>The truth was, before she had ascended, Amber had hesitated several times.</p>

  <p>Although she'd been in the Lower World, she knew that with her position and strength, participating in the battle of queens was the same as asking for trouble.</p>

  <p>However, Xun had suddenly shown up, so she'd had no choice in the matter.</p>

  <p>After the ascending passageway had been repaired, Amber had still hesitated before finally choosing to ascend.</p>

  <p>But Yao hadn't forgotten her even though she was a small figure.</p>

  <p>As a result, she had been imprisoned in this prison and made to suffer cruel and inhuman torture!</p>

  <p>In the past few years, she'd also heard Luo Zheng's voice every time it resounded throughout the universe. Apart from being shocked, she had been secretly pleased to hear it.</p>

  <p>This little guy had displayed all sorts of extraordinary abilities on the Sea God Continent. It had only been a few years since his ascension to the Upper World, but he had already been able to shake the entire universe.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng knew of her situation, she would have a sliver of hope of seeing the sun again.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for Amber to contact Luo Luo Zheng from this prison.</p>

  <p>So how would Luo Luo Zheng ever notice her?</p>

  <p>There would be no hope of that happening for the rest of her life.</p>

  <p>If she had known that she'd end up like this, she would have willingly crippled her cultivation and lived a happy and peaceful life in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. That would have been much better than flying to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Amber passed her days in despair.</p>

  <p>But today, all of a sudden, she heard that voice, that mysterious girl's voice.</p>

  <p>This mysterious girl seemed to be a great character from the Upper World. Even Amber could see that some of the Supreme Lords respected this mysterious girl.</p>

  <p>However, this girl kept pestering Luo Luo Zheng to tell her stories.</p>

  <p>These stories were rather interesting. While Amber was being tormented, no one could communicate with her. So, hearing a story from Luo Luo Zheng sometimes had become a small comfort for her.</p>

  <p>'The Illusion Battlefield has opened, what does that mean?' Amber lowered her head in thought. Her talent might be much greater than Freya's, but after ascending to the Upper World, she had been confined within this prison for a long time. Now, her knowledge and experience were far inferior to Freya's.</p>

  <p>Not long after, however, a speck of light appeared in front of Amber.</p>

  <p>"What is this light spot?" A hint of doubt appeared on Amber's face.</p>

  <p>Only after the mysterious girl finished speaking did Amber come to a realization.</p>

  <p>This spot of light was the entrance to the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>All warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could enter the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>'Does that mean I can also enter it?' Amber's eyes brightened all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>This was an opportunity given to her by the heavens!</p>

  <p>With Amber's strong willpower, it was impossible for her to just sit back and let the opportunity slip out of her hands.</p>

  <p>The moment she had this realization, she did her best to move toward that light spot.</p>

  <p>That spot of light was only a step away from Amber, but since her hands were tied to the bronze pillar, her range of movement was very limited.</p>

  <p>She did everything she could to bring her legs together and move toward the light spot bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Soon, her toes touched the edge of the light spot.</p>

  <p>"Come on. Just a little more," Amber said as she gritted her teeth.</p>

  <p>She continued to struggle forward with all her might.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a drop of black rain fell on her snow-white thigh.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With a plume of white smoke, the black raindrop started to boil, continuously corroding Amber's flesh. Not long after, it formed a small pit on Amber's leg.</p>

  <p>Although it was extremely painful, Amber didn't make a sound. These five to six years of punishment had made her numb to the pain of having her body corrode again and again. In the end, she always relied on the bronze pillar on her back that made her body slowly recover.</p>

  <p>"Come on! I've almost made it!"</p>

  <p>Right now, there was no room for Amber to retreat. She had to seize this opportunity no matter what!</p>

  <p>Her entire body was stretched taut and her legs stretched out to the limit.</p>

  <p>Finally, she stepped into the halo of light.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Amber's entire body was pulled by a force, firmly immobilized on the light spot. Then, her consciousness became ethereal and she found herself immersed in darkness.</p>

  <p>Five days was the period of time that the heavens gave the martial artists of the Upper World to prepare.</p>

  <p>Within these five days, all the martial artists that had entered beforehand were thrust into darkness, unable to move, unable to see, and unable to exit the light spots.</p>

  <p>In these five days, something had gone wrong in all the Illusion Spaces in the universe.</p>

  <p>An Illusion Space was not a rare thing. The great sects, sacred places, and races all had their own Illusion Space built for martial artists to cultivate and spar with one another.</p>

  <p>But after the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, all the Illusion Spaces had been completely blocked, making it impossible for anyone to enter them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a pyramid began to appear above every Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>It was a giant pyramid formed by names.</p>

  <p>On this pyramid, the names of all the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in the 100, 000 supreme worlds were lined next to each other. The number of names on the pyramid was increasing rapidly.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, there were 128 Supreme Lords, over 200, 000 world lords, hundreds of millions of Spirit Transformation Realm powerhouses, and hundreds of billions of Spirit Supreme Realm powerhouses.</p>

  <p>As for warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, they existed in trillions.</p>

  <p>All the creatures of the 100, 000 supreme worlds were curiously searching for something.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Illusion Battlefield had not yet officially begun, so the names on the pyramid were not arranged in any rank or order. They were all gathered at the bottom of the pyramid, and looking for a particular warrior's name was the same as looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>However, all of the great races, Supreme Lords, and world lords had already set their sights on the pyramid of their own races, hoping to see the names of their races' talents appear at the top!</p>

  <p>In these five days, the number of names in the pyramid continued to rise rapidly. Many warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were joining the Illusion Battlefield this time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sat quietly on the ground, closing his eyes to rest his mind.</p>

  <p>120 hours passed. Five days and five nights...</p>

  <p>Following the sound of a clear and cold voice, he suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
