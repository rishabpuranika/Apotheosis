<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 637 The Wonders Of Cloudy City (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of all the divine textures, the one-star divine texture was the basic.</p>

  <p>Some divine textures were considered much more powerful than one could ever imagine. The power of the divine texture was indicated in the number of stars in its name. The seven-star divine texture, for example, was only the size of a palm but it could destroy a piece of land instantaneously. It had the power to destroy the whole Central Region. It was a powerful tool that could fall into the wrong hands and destroy the world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still had a long way to go before he could master the seven-star divine texture drawing skill. Even the cyan dragon itself couldn't draw it as well as his soul energy had dried up. But even if the cyan dragon could, Luo Luo Zheng still didn't have the right materials to draw the seven-star divine texture with.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was very interested in acquiring a four-star divine texture called "Soul Breath". This divine texture had a special function of doubling the efficiency of cultivation without any negative effect.</p>

  <p>His low cultivation had been his biggest worry since he entered the Central Region. But acquiring the divine texture called "Soul Breath" would be very helpful to him. He could improve his cultivation level much faster with the help of the divine texture.</p>

  <p>At an early age of eighteen, Luo Luo Zheng had reached grade four of the nature level. With this achievement, he was already good enough in C County.</p>

  <p>However, in the Cloud Sect, such achievement was just average.</p>

  <p>Comparing with the other disciples in the Cloud Sect, Luo Luo Zheng was just ordinary. And when he finally came to Central Region, his achievements were nothing at all. Luo Zheng's cultivation base was solid, and he had even challenged the Illuminating Soul Realm masters. However, he still might not be able to escape death if he fought with a practitioner who reached the pinnacle of the Illuminating Soul Realm or the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Thus, improving his cultivation level had become an urgent concern he needed to address.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that Tia might have already figured that out too, so she had arranged the disciples of Elite House to compete with him in hopes that this would help him improve. However, Luo Luo Zheng also knew that in achieving the maximum breakthrough in cultivation, one would also put his own life at risk.</p>

  <p>But the disciples of Elite House were not idiots. Among them were some high-rank practitioners of Cloud Hall who had figured out Tia's deliberate plan of sparring Luo Luo Zheng with them. Furthermore, the plan had a loophole in favor of Luo Luo Zheng?he could either choose to fight when his opponent was relatively weak or escape when his opponent was more powerful, and no one could catch him. Besides, the disciples of Elite House needed to fulfill the tasks assigned to them by Cloud Hall or cultivate in other locations.</p>

  <p>So there were a few times that Luo Luo Zheng went to Elite House only to find out that there was no one available for him to challenge.</p>

  <p>Tia finally gave up after realizing that her plan wouldn't work. Without any means to progress his cultivation, Luo Luo Zheng took some of his necessary belongings and then left Cloud Hall to collect the materials of the divine texture called "Soul Breath".</p>

  <p>As the new day came, the golden rays of the sun shone over the walls of the Cloud Hall. The morning breeze whispered through its halls and slowly drifting clouds covered the entire Cloud Hall. Luo Luo Zheng was standing at the edge of Cloud Hall. He was mesmerized as the sun waved its rays in between the valleys. He took a deep breath and jumped.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could use the flying chariot provided by Cloud Hall, but he decided not to. He took this as an opportunity to test the one-star Wind Feather he had just made. In the Upper World, Wind Feathers were only provided to disciples who were at the levels below the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Thus, many disciples would opt to use the flying chariot. It was the first time for Luo Luo Zheng to try it. After putting on the Wind Feather, Luo Luo Zheng instantly felt a frail wind brush his body. It could only mean that despite not having reached the Illuminating Soul Realm yet, he could fly with the help of the Wind Feather.</p>

  <p>The wind became stronger.</p>

  <p>With the wind whirring through his body, Luo Luo Zheng jumped down a height of more than a thousand meters. With the combined energy released from the Phoenix Crystal and the natural power of wind, he floated like a leaf in the air. He had never felt this light in his life. After finding an ideal landing point, Luo Luo Zheng slightly slowed down and let the wind take over. He floated freely but slowly before finally landing on the ground.</p>

  <p>This method was quite the same as the one Lewis had used.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, two nature creatures who were on their way to town were stunned when they saw Luo Luo Zheng who appeared to be flying. They couldn't believe their eyes. Luo Luo Zheng was also a nature creature like them, but he was already able to fly.</p>

  <p>These two practitioners came from Cloudy City. They were aware that there was a grade four sect called Cloud Hall from a thousand meters above this area. They guessed that Luo Luo Zheng must have floated down from that sect. Cloud Hall was known to be a great place where only very talented cultivators had the opportunity to practice. So, did that also mean that a nature creature from Cloud Hall could fly? Even after giving it a thought, the two nature creatures could not comprehend the possibility of a practitioner on their same level could learn how to fly. It was beyond anyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen the two nature creatures as he was attempting to land, but he ignored their presence. He rushed toward Cloudy City along the road he picked. Before taking on this journey, Luo Luo Zheng had asked Lasseter about the branch of the World Commercial Alliance. He was told that it was in Cloudy City, hence the reason he was here.</p>

  <p>As he successfully landed, he immediately made his way to Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>As he entered, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but notice the difference between the Central Region and the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>With Cloud Hall and Cloud School located here, Cloudy City could be considered as the main city in the Central Region. Despite its size, it was still far better compared to the Burning Sky Imperial Capital in the Eastern Region.</p>
