<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3848 High In The Sky </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The invisible space blade, after cutting open the huge flying ship, continued to expand in all directions.</p>

  <p>High up in the sky, a group of tiger-headed wild geese were flying in a herringbone formation. The one in the middle suddenly let out an almighty screech before splitting into two.</p>

  <p>The other wild geese were confused as they roared and scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>A straight, neat crack had appeared on the ground beneath the flying ship, extending all the way from north to south till it had reached the boundary walls on both sides of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>This space blade had cut through a great number of plants and creatures along the way.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the flying ship was made of one whole floating stone, which was why it didn't fall even when it was cut into two.</p>

  <p>However, the three red crystals stored in the flying ship were now exposed.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, and Flamine were still beside the red crystals. Their faces darkened as they looked up at the flying ship. They had only heard a muffled sound before everything had changed.</p>

  <p>The dazzling light from the red crystals in the sun attracted Usman's attention. He stared at the corporeal bodies in the red crystals, a contemptuous smile on his face.</p>

  <p>This had been too easy.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace didn't even have a member at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>All of their members were good for nothing. How could it be called a super force?</p>

  <p>With such thoughts in his mind, he turned and shot an arm out at the red crystals.</p>

  <p>"Mom," Feng Ge called worriedly.</p>

  <p>"Step back. I won't let him pass," ordered Flamine.</p>

  <p>Traces of the divine fire of the Jin Wu spread along her skin. She was about to take a fighting stance.</p>

  <p>"But can you stop him by yourself?" Feng Ge didn't think Flamine could stop the black haired young man.</p>

  <p>"She is not alone!" dozens of figures began to float towards them from the end of the cabin.</p>

  <p>The voice belonged to Phoenix, who was leading these members of the Jin Wu. Their wings looked like flags rising up into the air.</p>

  <p>The members of the Holy Soul Realm of the Jin Wu went along when the Taiyi Heaven Palace had begun to migrate.</p>

  <p>But the Jin Wu preferred to stay out of the limelight. They seldom went out in public even when they had been in the Taiyi Mountain. They were now at the bottom of the cabin ever since they had moved with the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>But now that the flying ship had cracked, the members of the Jin Wu were out in the open. .</p>

  <p>Micah and Bagot rushed forward to Usman.</p>

  <p>They had once been assistants to Emperor Ji, the way Pearce and Auden were assistants to Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>They struck their palms out as they approached Usman and under the combined force, Usman was blasted backwards.</p>

  <p>Half the flying ship that was floating in the air because of the loss of driving force, began to slowly rotate in the air because of the inverse impact of the two palms.</p>

  <p>"Move the crystals away as soon as possible!" Micah shouted.</p>

  <p>The members of the Jin Wu weren't worried about Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying, but they had to protect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Flamine didn't hesitate as she carried the red crystal that contained Eastern Emperor Taiyi on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>Phoenix flapped her wings and raised the crystal that contained Luo Zheng, while Bagot gently raised the red crystal that contained Ying.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Their carrying the crystals meant that they were about to open the space channels and escape.</p>

  <p>But Usman's voice stopped them in their tracks. "You can't leave."</p>

  <p>A long, transparent saber appeared in his hand and he twirled it around, as if showing off his moves.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, three shots sounded from beside Phoenix, Flamine, and Bagot.</p>

  <p>The space channels that the three of them had built, collapsed in an instant.</p>

  <p>The dust had barely settled when Usman attacked them, violently slashing the saber in his hand at them.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Two more visible space fluctuations spread towards Feng Ge and the group.</p>

  <p>Just like the invisible space blade that had appeared earlier, these space fluctuations continued to expand forward, cutting through everything along the way.</p>

  <p>"Dodge!"</p>

  <p>Flamine, Feng Ge, and all the members of the Jin Wu dispersed.</p>

  <p>Another resounding crack sounded, and the half of the flying ship further split into two pieces.</p>

  <p>"It's no fun, letting you go so easily!"</p>

  <p>Usman said, his growing excitement palpable. He flew up into the air and waved the transparent saber even more zealously.</p>

  <p>An invisible blade spread out every time he waved his saber, and advanced all the way to the end of the province.</p>

  <p>If one looked down from the sky, one could see long thin lines appearing on the ground. Anything that blocked the thin lines was ruthlessly sliced into pieces.</p>

  <p>The power of the invisible blade was terrifying but it wasn't very fast.</p>

  <p>Flamine and the members of the Jin Wu were able to easily dodge them.</p>

  <p>However, it was difficult for the giant flying ships of the other six mountains to avoid these messy blades. They couldn't escape the invisible blades. Many disciples in the ships had already encountered these blades and received a brutal cutting through.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race swarmed out of their flying ships to attack the Taiyi Heaven Palace warriors who had left the flying ships.</p>

  <p>In under five minutes, the scene had turned chaotic, the smell of blood spreading in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan stood atop the Bearing race's flying ship, looking up at the sky. His body was like a statue made of molten iron. He wasn't looking at what was going on below him. It was like he thought it had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>He didn't do anything, even though it was now extremely easy for him to capture Luo Zheng who was sealed within the red crystal.</p>

  <p>In the sky, at a height of about three million feet, several small black dots floated in the air.</p>

  <p>If one were to move closer, they would find that these black dots were actually black ships.</p>

  <p>When the Xuanyuan had received the order of the Element Spirit race, he had known that this trip wouldn't be easy.</p>

  <p>The dilapidated Taiyi Heaven Palace was not within the scope of his plan, and there had been no need for the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race to dispatch all their powerful warriors to deal with it. But he knew that he had to face a more troublesome opponent.</p>

  <p>Twelve people stood on the black ships in the sky.</p>

  <p>There usually were exactly thirteen people in the Black Ship. But today, the last position was reserved for the Evil God. Now that he had been rebuilt and kept on the Other Shore, he wouldn't be able to get out before he descended. Therefore, the thirteenth position was vacant.</p>

  <p>"I think the guy down there is Usman," Tomos, the Ear Mouse, remarked sharply.</p>

  <p>"He has come back to life too soon! I really want to go down and crush him into pieces. Captain, when can we take action?" The brass man had never liked Usman.</p>

  <p>The captain's voice sounded from deep within his black cloak, "No hurry.</p>

  <p>Everyone hasn't arrived yet. It's too disadvantageous for us to fight now."</p>

  <p>"How long do we have to wait?" the brass man asked again.</p>

  <p>"Until Fuxi can't restrain himself any longer," the captain replied.</p>
