<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy stopped one of them and asked, "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The Bearing race is coming to take revenge," the man answered. "They released the snakes!"</p>

  <p>"Snakes? What snakes?" Zheng looked aghast.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Snakes raised by the Bearing race," Dorothy answered with a frown. "How dare they use snakes to attack us! Let's go out and have a look!"</p>

  <p>They rushed out of the temple, but black creatures suddenly blocked their path.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the creatures closely. They were black snakes, but he couldn't see any other details on them.</p>

  <p>In fact, they could only see the appearance and details of the aboriginal inhabitants clearly on the Other Shore. The Souls of Light and even Zheng's body were outsiders to the Other Shore, and others could only trace out the outlines of them. The snakes were brought to the Other Shore by the Bearing race, so he naturally couldn't see them clearly.</p>

  <p>"The snakes are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Return to the temple quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Does the Bearing race want to attack the Oneness Sky Palace's temple?"</p>

  <p>Resentment filled the voices of the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, many Soul Snakes were cut in half.</p>

  <p>These disciples were in a panic. Some of them fled, while the others pulled out their swords and began to deal with the snakes.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace disciples were all powerful. The Souls of Light glowed purple light; this meant they were in the ninth or tenth stage of the Other Shore Realm and soon would become Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>But still, they were weaker than the group of Soul Snakes in front of them.</p>

  <p>They kept on cutting and cutting but, in the end, they had to retreat to the entrance of the temple.</p>

  <p>"Are these Soul Snakes planning to break into our temple?" Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head calmly. "I don't think so," she replied.</p>

  <p>Despite the small conflicts between the Bearing race and the Oneness Sky Palace throughout the years, they never launched an all-out attack. If the Bearing race decided to break into the temple, then that would signal an allout war between the two races.</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>A sharp scream was heard not too far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy turned their attention towards the noise and saw four people surrounded by snakes.</p>

  <p>The four people's souls were still light brown and their breaths were a little messy. Obviously, they had just stepped into the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>They were simply trying to return to the temple, but the snakes had them surrounded. They had tried their best to fight against the snakes, but were then losing power.</p>

  <p>They were no match for the snakes. They would die sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they leave the Other Shore?" Zheng was curious.</p>

  <p>Souls of Light could simply choose to depart the Other Shore. Anyone in the right mind would definitely resort to leaving at the sight of the Soul Snakes.</p>

  <p>"Look at their feet," Dorothy prodded.</p>

  <p>There were faint blue lights that shone underneath the feet of the four people.</p>

  <p>Members of large races had been cultivating in the Other Shore for many years. They were able to develop various methods that entrapped Souls of Light in the Other Shore. This included the Soul Binding Thread that tied people's souls into the place. The technique was popular among the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>It looked like the four disciples had fallen into a dead end.</p>

  <p>"I'll rescue them,"</p>

  <p>Zheng announced as he darted forward. He twisted his arm and a sharp thorn flew through it.</p>

  <p>The thorn shone purple, indicating Zheng's soul was much stronger than the Soul Snakes. Quickly, he attacked the snakes and had dozens of snakes cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Dorothy joined Zheng and fought the snakes as well.</p>

  <p>A small soul sword appeared around her, ready to cut any snake that came near Dorothy.</p>

  <p>They cut a path in the middle of the snakes and rushed towards the four people.</p>

  <p>The four warriors were trembling.</p>

  <p>They had entered the Other Shore a few years ago, and now they reached the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm. They were diligent and outstanding disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace. They were not prepared to die right there and then.</p>

  <p>They were close to breaking down when surging soul waves suddenly came into light.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Soul Snakes were swept up, thrown all over, and cut like straws.</p>

  <p>Two Souls of Light shining with purple lights landed beside them.</p>

  <p>"What powerful soul fluctuations!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! The Indigo Souls! They are Indigo Souls!"</p>

  <p>"Sophia, we're finally rescued!"</p>

  <p>Tears of joy swelled in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Sophia had her eyes fixed on one of the souls. A sense of familiarity lingered in her mind.</p>

  <p>"We can't stay here," Zheng said hastily. "Return to the temple quickly."</p>

  <p>Then, he walked past Sophia, blocking the surging snakes.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy were as sharp as ever. Their teamwork made them invincible. Each time the waves of snakes crashed towards them, they simply flicked their swords and split them apart.</p>

  <p>"Sophia, run! What's wrong with you? Run!"</p>

  <p>Sophia felt someone tug at her arms. When she realized what was happening, she quickly followed them and rushed toward the temple.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy stood behind and continued fighting back. Each time they launched an attack, they also inched backwards. Slowly, they were retreating to the entrance of the temple.</p>

  <p>When they finally reached the entrance, the Soul Snakes suddenly stopped attacking.</p>

  <p>"They stopped?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, all the Soul Snakes just abruptly halted and stopped at the entrance.</p>

  <p>"They know their line. They know that as soon as they enter the temple, they'd be in Oneness Sky Palace's territory. Crossing the line would be as good as declaring war against the Oneness Sky Palace. This is the rule signed by all the races in the Source World," Dorothy explained.</p>

  <p>All of the great powers had established their own temples within the Other Shore. The Source World was already filled with wars; no one wanted the same for the Other Shore. Thus, everyone agreed that none of them were allowed to attack each other's temple.</p>

  <p>No race would cross boundaries unless they had the intention of wiping out the other.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Bearing race invaded the Nine Li race's temple. This triggered a great war between the two races. Soon, the Nine Li race was exterminated.</p>

  <p>"We can't just let the Soul Snakes block our path," Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>The Soul Snakes swarmed the entrance of the temple. They even covered the sculpture in front of it. The Oneness Sky Palace disciples trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>The Soul Snakes seemed agitated. Suddenly, they cleared a path and made way for three warriors.</p>

  <p>The warriors strolled over and stopped in front of the temple.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Is the Bearing race planning to start a war?" Dorothy asked the warriors arrogantly.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had plenty of powerful warriors among them, but the Oneness Sky Palace was far from an inferior race.</p>

  <p>If war erupted between them, the Oneness Sky Palace could summon back all the warriors in Stage Thirteen of Lust World. It would be a great fight and it would be difficult to predict who the winner would be.</p>
