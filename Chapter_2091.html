  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the muffled sound, Mateo collided into the ground after being punched powerfully by Blayd.</p>

  <p>Then, a crack appeared across the earth, revealing a gaping hole.</p>

  <p>"These Waves Devouring Worms are able to devour most of my fighting intent. They possess a pretty good set of abilities. Raising these small worms within your body would probably be a very difficult task," Blayd lightly said. "What a pity... It's still far from enough!"</p>

  <p>Right after he finished speaking, Blayd chased after Mateo viciously. A series of muffled explosions then arose left and right. For a moment, the fighting intent filled the area and the black light seemed blinding. The Dream Sound World was only a narrow battle ring to the two True Gods.</p>

  <p>This broken battle ring was collapsing quickly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't seem interested in the fight as he walked towards Supreme Lord of Original Sin. He then handed over a space ring to him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin greeted Luo Zheng with gratitude upon receiving the space ring in his palm.</p>

  <p>He gave Luo Zheng a light nod and they simultaneously turned their heads to look at the other side. Apparently, Supreme Lord Lester was standing right behind them the entire time.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester's Heavenly Destiny of Revival was very significant and precious. This led him to never participate in a battle. He was even able to revive the Supreme Lords who had just lost their lives.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of the chaotic war, he saved the lives of seven Supreme Lords with just his miraculous Heavenly Destiny of Revival.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the space ring that Luo Zheng had given to Supreme Lord of Original Sin was keeping Maha's Silver Moon Wolves. These were the wolves Luo Zheng had previously killed as he saw them feasting on Nathan's corpse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made it a point to store the wolves as much as he could, because they would have Nathan's parts in them. He stored the fragments of the wolves and Nathan into the space ring, and hoped that Nathan was lucky enough to be revived by Supreme Lord Lester.</p>

  <p>Margaret's corpse was also placed strategically into another space ring.</p>

  <p>However, her body was completely preserved in comparison to Nathan.</p>

  <p>With the Heavenly Destiny of Revival's power, it would be simple enough to revive her. They knew that reviving Mu Ning was not going to be too difficult, but Luo Zheng couldn't help but worry.</p>

  <p>As the battle between the two True Gods went on, the Sacred Supreme Lords didn't intend to take action. They already knew that joining the battle wouldn't benefit the situation in any way. Looking at it critically, they'd have to deal with Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle, many mid-rank Supreme Lords and low-rank Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe if they made a move.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords, from both sides, understood this. It would be useless to take action.</p>

  <p>This was where Luo Zheng decided to take advantage of the situation. He'd hoped that at this time, Supreme Lord Lester could resurrect Mu Ning and Nathan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held out Margaret's corpse and held her horizontally in his hands, carefully transferring the corpse to Supreme Lord Lester.</p>

  <p>Margaret's eyes were closed very tight. She was a docile woman, and her face was very serene, almost as if she was merely sleeping.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently shook her hand with a trace of sadness in his eyes. He then placed her lightly on the ground and made a gesture to ask Supreme Lord Lester to start resurrecting her.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester nodded in agreement. He extended his hand and pressed it lightly against his forehead, and a wheel of light slowly rose up above his head. That was known as the Heavenly Destiny of Revival.</p>

  <p>This light wheel surrounded Margaret's corpse. "There's no problem to revive her," said Supreme Lord Lester. "I can activate her life energy with the Heavenly Destiny of Revival, but the process will take some time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Supreme Lord Lester's words.</p>

  <p>There was definitely a lot of time.</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lord of Original Sin who stood beside them, he poured out the corpse pieces of the Silver Moon Wolves from the space ring.</p>

  <p>The fragments of the Silver Moon Wolves had fallen onto the ground, and the stench of blood filled the air. There were hints of golden blood as well, probably belonging to Nathan.</p>

  <p>As the surrounding Supreme Lords saw this, they frowned.</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lord Lester's Heavenly Destiny of Revival was deemed very strong, there was always a limit to his abilities. Because Nathan was torn to pieces and even swallowed by the wolves, it was uncertain if he could be revived or not.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester also revealed a hesitant expression. He didn't have any confidence in resurrecting Nathan, though he knew he had to try.</p>

  <p>On another note, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, a top-rank Supreme Lord leading the Thoughtless Minds, was anxious and worried at this moment. He had never been so upset before. When he had to face the disciples of the True God, he managed to remain calm. However, Nathan's life seemed to take a toll on him. He was very uneasy thinking about the uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"I can only do my best," said Supreme Lord Lester as he observed the corpse pieces. Then, he gently waved his hand and the wheel of light moved out again, circling around the fragments like a halo.</p>

  <p>As the light radiated around the fragments, they began to squirm and wiggle, coming to life. Each part seemed to know its original position, and moved towards it. This included the parts that belonged to the Silver Moon Wolves.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny of Revival belonged directly to the Life Law.</p>

  <p>However, this kind of theurgy could be only used on secondary creatures. This was a rule because the magical ability of 'resurrection' didn't exist in the divine land. In the past, the universe was still too small compared to the divine land, and only Holy Beings could bestow this ability to the inner world. This made Supreme Lord Lester's Heavenly Destiny of Revival something quite useless to Wynn.</p>

  <p>The pieces of the corpses continued to move around and piece themselves together, and a gentle life energy was emitted from the Heavenly Destiny of Revival. The pieces were slowly regained life energy throughout the process.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng had killed all of these Silver Moon Wolves, he put all the fragments of wolves into the space ring. Not long later, the Silver Moon Wolves' fragments had actually assembled together completely, but for some reason, the cracks and divisions were still visible.</p>

  <p>Remarkably, Nathan's body was also perfectly assembled, but because he had been devoured by the wolves, only the silhouette of a person could be seen.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin had a very blank expression as he tried his best to suppress his emotions. No one could feel comfortable while watching these sorts of things. Moreover, because Nathan was his son, he was incomparably sad seeing him like that.</p>

  <p>In another swift movement, Supreme Lord Lester waved his hand once more, and a beam of faint green light of life began to escape from the circular plate hovering over his head. The Heavenly Destiny of Revival was not simply used by means of the Life Law, because Supreme Lord Lester did not simply heal them. He had to completely bring back the life in them, and this meant that the Time Law was somehow incorporated into the process.</p>

  <p>As the light continued to beam outwards, it eventually turned into a light green tower, enveloping Supreme Lord Lester and the corpses of Nathan and Mu Ning with it. The people who were left to watch could no long see anything except the green light.</p>

  <p>With the Supreme Lord's soul power, it would be quite easy to detect what was happening within the tower. However, it was of common knowledge to not disturb Supreme Lord Lester at this moment.</p>

  <p>Moreover, most Supreme Lords only seemed to care about the battle of the True Gods, so they shifted their attention towards that.</p>

  <p>In comparison to Marko and Pranav, Mateo proved to be a lot stronger.</p>

  <p>To endure that for so long while injured was something people wouldn't even attempt to do.</p>

  <p>However, at this point, he was like a spent arrow. The Supreme Lords, Blayd and Mateo all knew this.</p>

  <p>When Mateo was eventually tested to his limits, the two streams of black tears finally stopped flowing from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you giving up?" Blayd asked lightly.</p>

  <p>This was a tough question mostly because Mateo's self-esteem was extremely high. His skill and perseverance were outstanding, so he had never been put in a situation where someone had to ask him if he would give up. Besides, this wasn't any ordinary battle. He was determined to win.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a hint of anger appeared across face as he stared at Blayd. "I have never known what it felt like to give up," he said. "And I'm not starting now."</p>

  <p>As he finished, he suddenly smacked his forehead with a heavy hand.</p>

  <p>Just then, a strange silhouette began to develop above his forehead, intricately formed with golden lines. Eventually, this formation developed into a strange, humanoid creature coming out of his forehead.</p>

  <p>This human-like being grabbed Mateo and stuffed him into its mouth, all in one go.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Blayd retreated immediately in fear.</p>

  <p>A chuckle echoed through the mist of the divine land. "Murphy, your disciple really isn't good. Although Blayd has been missing for so many years, his cultivation has been improved by a great deal. This, this surprises me." The laugh just lasted for only a short while, but it was obvious that the Holy Being who had spoken had seen the strange change in Mateo. His usual composed voice also became firm as he said,</p>

  <p>"Murphy, you have even imparted such a vicious cultivation method, such as the Soul-eater Summoning Method, to your disciple! Are you crazy?"</p>
