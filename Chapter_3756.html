<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the bald giant heard the human heroes sing, he couldn't help but respond, "You are right! They are indeed a group of cowards. They set up a contemptible trap against me, and that was how they caught me!"</p>

  <p>Once he finished, he gritted his teeth in pure anger.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit race are quite cunning and despicable," Zheng pointed out.</p>

  <p>As the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization translated for him, the human heroes conveyed his words using song.</p>

  <p>"Exactly! What a group of deceitful bastards!" The bald giant agreed as he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Such a hateful race just brought shame to all of the civilizations in the chaos!" Zheng continued to curse in disgust.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the human heroes furrowed their eyebrows in confusion while Zheng cursed the Element Spirit Civilization so passionately.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Snake Goddess broke the tension. "Zheng, what's the point of cursing the Element Spirit Civilization this way?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven also looked up at Zheng, revealing a look of doubt.</p>

  <p>They encouraged Zheng to inquire about the bald man's background before making any impulsive actions. It would have been helpful if they knew if he was a member of the Instant Civilization, or if he had any knowledge on what civilizations existed in the Abstruse Energy World, etc.</p>

  <p>However, instead of doing so, Zheng cursed profusely at the Element Spirit Civilization, which surprised the rest of them.</p>

  <p>For them, it seemed like a meaningless bicker especially because they all cultivated to such a high level.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Zheng winked at them. "I think we'd better go along with the giant first."</p>

  <p>Based on what the giant had done, Zheng figured that he was an impulsive and wilful man.</p>

  <p>Though the giant spared their lives, there was no guarantee he wouldn't return if Zheng irritated him some more.</p>

  <p>This was the reason Zheng echoed the giant's curses on the Element Spirit Civilization. He wanted to gain his approval.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, this was an ordeal to the human heroes, though. While he was cursing, the heroes conveyed the translations with songs that they would not be able to understand.</p>

  <p>This process took a long while, and eventually gave time for the bald giant to cool off most of his anger. His violent aura had dissipated a lot over this time.</p>

  <p>He looked at Zheng with what seemed like a look of friendliness. "You look similar to me, my friend," the giant said. "Are you also a member of the Colossus race? But why are you so small in size?"</p>

  <p>The Colossus race? What was that?</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zheng and the others repeated the phrase to themselves as they tried to see if it would ring a bell.</p>

  <p>This gave them insight that the bald giant was not alone. He had a race.</p>

  <p>"I can change my body size. Look!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng secretly activated the Wild God Power which sent his body to grow up to twenty feet high.</p>

  <p>He made sure to be cautious, especially because of the restriction of the Divine Fire Shield. There was no way Zheng would send himself to the ordinary size of a Wild God.</p>

  <p>The giant's eyes widened at the sight of this. "You can even shift your body size like a member of Colossus race! The angrier we are, the larger we can grow." The giant seemed excited to know Zheng was an ally. "Are we exactly from the same race? Are there any others of our kind in this world?"</p>

  <p>Zheng knew well that he did not belong to the Colossus race.</p>

  <p>However, he noticed the similarity in his appearance with the giant, which made him wonder if the human race did have any connection to the so-called Colossus race.</p>

  <p>But in order to be on his good side, Zheng had to play smart. Hence, Zheng didn't deny him, and instead, gave a vague answer and a shrug. "Well, it's possible."</p>

  <p>But just as the bald giant was about to jump for joy, Zheng changed the subject. "As far as I know, the creatures in the Cold Prisons have been imprisoned for a very long time. Some have exceeded eras! My friend, do you plan to be imprisoned for a long time here as well?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the bald giant's face shifted from excitement to infuriation. His nostrils bulged as he took heavy breaths. "They can't imprison me. If they do, they will pay for it!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke his last word, the bald giant pulled out a huge iron stake from his belt.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race tied up the bald giant to this iron stake at the center of the Cold Prison. However, under his relentless struggle, he managed to pull the stake up from the ground, and that was why he could move within the range of the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Still, he was chained, which prevented him from breaking free completely.</p>

  <p>However, the bald giant believed that the three chains proved no threat to him.</p>

  <p>"But now that this event has happened, it won't be long before the Element Spirit race sends reinforcements to tie you up again. If it comes to that, you won't have another chance to escape!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant wanted nothing more than freedom from the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>As Zheng said this, the bald giant shook his head as he realized the gravity of his situation.</p>

  <p>Even though he killed and repelled the Five-Element Slaves, he could not underestimate the strength of the Element Spirit race again. There was no way he wanted to stay imprisoned.</p>

  <p>"I have to get out of this damned place now!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant screamed, impatient and bitter. He shook and flailed around in attempt to tear the iron chain around his hands.</p>

  <p>What Zheng did not know was the material used for the iron chains. Though the giant possessed immense strength, the chains were undamaged.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just then, the bald giant smashed the iron chain onto the ground. He slouched and heaved for a breath, helpless and panting. "I... I can't destroy it!"</p>

  <p>"Can you try and throw the chain out of the Cold Prison so I can take a look?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He summoned the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others to take a look at the chains.</p>

  <p>Zheng was determined to free the giant, so that he could use the giant's power to defeat the Five-Element Slaves in Stage Thirty.</p>

  <p>"Can you break this chain for me?"</p>

  <p>The bald giant pleaded. He stretched out his hands, showing it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing it up close, the iron chain was as wide as a human being. It was bronze, while the rings were fastened tightly.</p>

  <p>The soul of the Primeval Lord of Heaven floated up to get a closer look at the chain. With a light tap of his finger, lines of densely arranged runes suddenly appeared on the chain's surface.</p>

  <p>Theses runes connected to one another, resembling a chain.</p>

  <p>Pleased, the Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled at such change. "Just as I suspected. It's a Magical Slipknot! Once an iron chain is painted with this kind of runes, a Magical Slipknot Array would form on the joints between every two rings. If one attempts to escape it, the chain would only tighten."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how we can break the array?" Zheng asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Please." The Primeval Lord of Heaven brushed off his shoulder. "This is a piece of cake."</p>

  <p>It was true that the Magical Slipknot Array was not too difficult to deal with. The Element Spirit race never would have guessed that someone would have helped the giant solve it.</p>

  <p>After Zheng told the bald giant that they could free him, his face lit up with pure excitement. In turn, he followed all their orders without another word.</p>

  <p>He obediently bent down, spread out hands, and placed them right before the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Extending his hands, the Primeval Lord of Heaven stroked one ring of the chain. Within seconds, a faint green light flashed from his palms.</p>

  <p>This light began to flow like a thick liquid as it made its way towards the Magical Slipknot Array.</p>

  <p>As the green light made contact with the Magical Slipknot Array, the array's originally golden light died down.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven retreated backward and merely nodded at the giant.</p>

  <p>With one stretch of his arms, the chain broke apart.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>It was in this moment that Libby's and Elizabeth's visions saw the numerous light spots in the Cold Prison dance.</p>

  <p>Zheng watched the bald giant intentionally. He noticed the giant did not expect it to be so easy, and his eyes widened at the knowledge that he was finally free.</p>
