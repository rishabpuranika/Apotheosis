<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 553 The Real Challenge On The Cliff </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng also realized what their weak points were, so he didn't leave.</p>

  <p>Although the young disciple in a white robe had great strength, Zheng was not frightened of him at all. He would be bolder if the other twelve disciples hadn't formed the array of Twelve Earthly Branches.</p>

  <p>He was in bad luck just now. He just hardly entered the valley when the twelve disciples formed the powerful array, and unfortunately, he was the first person that was attacked by it.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for these disciples to keep this array all the time. Therefore, if he was careful enough to keep a proper distance from them, he would be relatively safe.</p>

  <p>Lennon Zhao ordered the twelve disciples to continuously kill the ghost-faced spiders. There were many ghost-faced spiders covering almost every inch of the small island, but they died every time they were attacked by the array of Twelve Earthly Branches. Hence, eventually, the ghost-faced spiders were reducing in numbers.</p>

  <p>After fifteen minutes, there were fewer ghost-faced spiders rushing from behind the woods. Finally, the surviving ghost-faced spiders realized that they could not defeat these disciples by the virtue of quantity, so they had fallen back to the woods.</p>

  <p>After the ghost-faced spiders had disappeared, Lennon raised his hand and commanded with a wave, "Disperse!"</p>

  <p>The shining circle of life vitality under their feet broke and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Then the twelve disciples relaxed their wrists and ankles. Finally, they could take a break.</p>

  <p>The array of Twelve Earthly Branches had great strength, but it was difficult to form. It required a long time and great energy.</p>

  <p>"Lennon, how to pass the hidden test? Are we here only to slaughter these ghost-faced spiders?" a disciple asked.</p>

  <p>Lennon smiled faintly and said, "Of course not. The ghost-faced spider is only a small obstacle for us. The real challenge is on the cliff!"</p>

  <p>"On the cliff?" the other Cloud Hall disciples simultaneously raised their heads and looked towards the precipice.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Lennon ejected a swallow-shaped dart towards the precipice of the valley.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>These disciples expected that the dart would penetrate the rock of the precipice with Lennon's strength.</p>

  <p>However, to their surprise, the swallow-shaped dart bounced off a light screen the moment it touched the surface of the precipice.</p>

  <p>"The enchanted barrier. What is going on?" a Cloud Hall disciple asked.</p>

  <p>But this time, Lennon didn't say a word. Instead, he walked along the surface of the precipice and kept touching it.</p>

  <p>Other disciples were curious about Lennon's weird behavior. They gathered together and looked at him. At the same time, Zheng, who was hiding in a corner, also peered at him remotely. Although he had found out about the enchanted barrier covering the precipice earlier, he still had no idea what its function was.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Lennon seemed to touch a gear and instantly, the whole valley started to quake.</p>

  <p>There were rumbling sounds as the earth moved.</p>

  <p>It was as if a giant was pushing the valley and the sound echoed making the ears tingle.</p>

  <p>Just then, the look on the disciples' faces changed and Zheng also raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>The shape of the precipice was changing.</p>

  <p>Caves formed on the precipice one at a time, while some sections of rock stuck out of the precipice.</p>

  <p>"Killing the ghost-faced spider is just a warm-up. Now what we are facing is the real hidden test!" Lennon said faintly.</p>

  <p>"What is it? A treasure chest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. It is radiating a weird aura which means that the chest itself is a good treasure!"</p>

  <p>"These treasure chests look extraordinarily valuable. What is inside?"</p>

  <p>Treasure chests were displayed on the rocks that stuck out. Their shapes were about the same, but they were in different colors.</p>

  <p>The treasure chests on the lowest layer of the precipice were red, while those on the second layer were blue. The silver treasure chests were on the third layer, while the golden ones were on the fourth layer. And the treasure chest on the fifth layer was black.</p>

  <p>'These treasure chests probably were set by the builder of the Cloud Road to reward the disciples who pass the test. But what can be the rewards inside these chests? Weapons? Magical pills? Or perhaps cultivation books of lost supreme techniques?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>No matter what were inside the treasure chests, the rewards must be huge and precious. If not, the young disciple in white robe would not have spent so much time and energy activating the hidden test.</p>

  <p>The color of the treasure chests might stand for the degree of the reward.</p>

  <p>The red treasure chests were at the lowest position and the number of them was the largest. So, perhaps they contained the smallest rewards.</p>

  <p>The number of the blue treasure chest was less than half of the red treasure chests and they were placed one layer higher than the red chests.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the rewards in the blue treasure chests must be better. On the third layer, there were only six silver treasure chests.</p>

  <p>And there were two golden treasure chests and only one black treasure chest on the top layer.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a disciple suddenly said, "Look! Some treasure chests have been opened."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the direction that disciple pointed at. Indeed, six red treasure chests on the right side were opened.</p>

  <p>Looking at the treasure chests carefully, he found that other chests were also opened – three blue treasure chests and one silver treasure chest. But the golden treasure chests and the black treasure chest had not been opened yet.</p>

  <p>"These treasure chests are left by the builder of the Cloud Road as rewards for those who can pass the hidden test. Some disciples got rewards successfully. However, the builder of the Cloud Road was gone.</p>

  <p>Without the supply of new rewards, of course, there will be empty chests. Eventually, there will be nothing more," the young disciple in white robe slowly said. "We can choose the chests and take them away from the precipice! But it is not easy to get the treasure from the chest.</p>

  <p>The higher position the chest is in, the more difficult it is to get the treasure. Besides, each person gets only one chance. If you fall from the precipice, you will not have another chance to climb it!" he continued.</p>

  <p>"It is just to open a chest, right? How difficult can it be?" As the Cloud Hall disciple said it, he rushed to the precipice first and chose one chest.</p>

  <p>Now that these disciples could get there to take the hidden test, none of them was stupid. There were so many treasure chests on the precipice and the Cloud Road had opened for so many years. It was hard to tell how many disciples ever took the test. However, only about ten treasure chests were opened. Hence, it would be very difficult to get the treasure from the chests.</p>

  <p>The disciple wasn't greedy and just aimed for the red treasure chest. It was the closest one to him and with just a leap, he could reach that rock platform.</p>

  <p>That disciple leaped on the rock platform in an elegant manner with the red treasure chest only one step away from him. However, when he was about to open it, a sharp sound echoed from the cave beside the rock platform and his facial expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>The sound came from a strong wind blowing through a cave rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Hoo hoo hoo... Hoo hoo hoo..."</p>

  <p>The strong wind suddenly came out of the cave, blew that disciple and made him lose his balance. The disciple reacted quickly and used a technique to fix himself on the platform. However, it didn't work. He was being pushed to the edge of the platform by the strong wind.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the technique was useless, he got down and tightly held onto a protuberance on the surface of the platform. Although the pressure decreased, he could still not even raise his head because the wind was too strong. He could only hold onto the rock platform with both his hands, but his joints had turned to pale because of overexertion.</p>

  <p>It was a rare opportunity for the disciples to take part in the test on the Cloud Road and no one was willing to let the chance slip. The disciple was determined to get his hands on the treasure chest. He clenched his teeth and struggled in the wind.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and thought, 'He can't do it.'</p>

  <p>Lennon also shook his head. He was not surprised because he had expected that the first disciple would fail.</p>

  <p>After struggling for about half a minute, that disciple could not resist the strong wind any longer and fell heavily from the rock platform.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Seeing what happened, the other disciples of Cloud Hall walked over and carried him up.</p>

  <p>Those who cultivated martial arts had good physical quality, therefore, that disciple didn't get badly injured. After all, he was a master of Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"I'll try again! I can't lose!" That disciple was not willing to quit. He thought that he just failed because he had never expected the wind to attack. If he could just resist the wind and try again, he might get the red treasure chest successfully.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, that disciple rushed to the precipice once more.</p>
