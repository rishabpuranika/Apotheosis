<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch to the wall resulted in a dull sound. But unlike an ordinary stone wall, it didn't break into pieces.</p>

  <p>The metal wall was unusually tenacious? Zheng's punch only made an impression on the surface.</p>

  <p>"It didn't break!"</p>

  <p>"Not enough!"</p>

  <p>"But that punch was strong! He'll break it after a few more."</p>

  <p>The over a thousand Souls of Light felt nerves seeping in, especially the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>When they last explored the place, they had tried all sorts of methods, using even taboo power. But their souls were simply too weak, resulting in failure. They could only turn back in the end.</p>

  <p>But with just a punch, Zheng had dented the wall. The Ear Mice weren't disappointed.</p>

  <p>'It's tougher than I thought?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Without much hesitation, Zheng darted forward, his legs bending. Once again, he threw a punch to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>And with another dull sound, the dent sank further inward by two inches.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Every hit made the entire tower vibrate from the shock.</p>

  <p>Above the basement stood several Nine Li people who could clearly feel the tremors from below.</p>

  <p>"Brother, he's really smashing the wall in," remarked the human girl.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see. We can't go down there until they're all dead," her brother responded.</p>

  <p>The girl was left conflicted.</p>

  <p>Though she was still a little worried about the physical body's safety, she couldn't go down and stop the man in the current situation.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice wouldn't just let her go down, let alone a thousand Souls of Light of alien races.</p>

  <p>"We'd better retreat. We don't want to get caught up in the mess," one of them suggested.</p>

  <p>And so the human girl could only follow them out the passageway.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The metal wall had sunk deeper and deeper until thumb-sized cracks began appearing on its surface.</p>

  <p>The other side of the wall was engraved with circular patterns? the strange markings spread across the wall all the way to the platforms on both sides where two livid armors stood.</p>

  <p>They were each about the height of a person, a rusty saber in each hand? they gave off a sinister and intrepid aura, especially with chains as thick as rods wrapping around the armors.</p>

  <p>For years, they stood motionless, experiencing many vicissitudes of life.</p>

  <p>Since the two were placed at the end of the Grand Sky Temple, surrounded by the Dark Region, no race had come to know of their existence.</p>

  <p>Finally, the wall cracked when Zheng threw more than 20 punches in a row.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all the Souls of Light of the alien races craned their necks, trying to catch a glimpse of what was behind the wall through the cracks.</p>

  <p>None of them, not even Zheng or the Ear Mice had any idea what lay behind the wall.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Finally, the patterns on the other side of the wall shattered.</p>

  <p>As they were broken, the light continued spreading through the remaining patterns to the platforms where the chains wrapping around the armors were also broken to pieces, inch by inch.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!" "Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two spots of bright red light flickered from under the armors' headgear, as though the eyes hidden in the darkness opened wide.</p>

  <p>Free from the chains' restriction, the armors came back to life and jumped right off the platforms.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The figures were so heavy that the ground shook with every step they took.</p>

  <p>"What's that sound?"</p>

  <p>"Something's approaching the wall!"</p>

  <p>"What is it..."</p>

  <p>Curiosity spread among the Souls of Light, but the cracks in the wall were too narrow for anyone to see clearly what was behind them.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng, standing at the front of the crowd, couldn't get a clear look.</p>

  <p>But the sound of heavy footsteps had made Zheng grow vigilant. Frowning, he moved back slowly.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang..."</p>

  <p>The sounds began accelerating until something seemed to start pushing against the wall from the other side.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone heard a kind of metallic, ear-piercing sound.</p>

  <p>Rusty sabers were piercing the wall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng was quick enough to retreat when he saw the bulging wall.</p>

  <p>His body would have been pierced, otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle, sizzle..."</p>

  <p>Four rusty sabers began twisting until they made circles in the wall. From the holes emerged the two sinister armors? they rushed right at the Souls of Light in the basement.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Without even having time to process the situation, Zheng pulled on Dorothy and rushed back.</p>

  <p>He moved so quickly that the Souls of Light behind him were knocked out of balance.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light that had gathered in the basement were left in a fit of chaos? they scrambled up the passageway, jamming it in the process.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"What are those things?"</p>

  <p>"It's a trap, a trap!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The figures jumped up in the basement and smashed into the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Given the very weight of the armors, how could the Souls of Light possibly survive an attack from them? They were easily crushed to death. Even those that had been slightly grazed just turned into dust.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the Souls of Light were, they were completely vulnerable in front of the armors.</p>

  <p>Whines and screams resounded in the basement? it had become a terrifying scene of carnage.</p>

  <p>Everyone began fending for only themselves? how could they worry about any other Souls of Light in that situation? Some even began killing their own kind just to free up the passageway.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy were in the same boat, rushing toward the free path.</p>

  <p>Because he led the way with his physical body, the Souls of Light posed no hindrance.</p>

  <p>Within a mere six seconds, he and Dorothy had arrived at the entrance. But just as Zheng took another step forward, something broke the surface above them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The entire passageway collapsed without a sign, cutting off everyone's one chance of surviving.</p>

  <p>'Is it really a trap? Or did the Ear Mice just get something wrong?' A thought flashed through Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"The passageway is broken!"</p>

  <p>"Ahhh! Help!"</p>

  <p>"It's going to kill me!"</p>

  <p>The lost path put all the Souls of Light in despair.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a wide basement, after all, and they were all crammed in the space.</p>

  <p>The two armors holding the rusty sabers merely spun and killed off anything in close proximity. They seemed to glide from left to right like a metal storm.</p>

  <p>Any Soul of Light caught in the calamity was killed instantly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng... I'm scared!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy gripped his hand extremely tightly as her eyes filled with fear.</p>

  <p>Mere seconds had passed since the armors broke through the wall, but only half of the Souls of Light were left.</p>

  <p>Because they were in the temple, they had no way to leave the Other Shore? they were in an even more dangerous situation than in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>At this point, it seemed as though they truly had nowhere to escape.</p>
