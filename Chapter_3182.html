</p>

  <p>After leaving the cave, Zheng returned to the hall.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples who hadn't received any rewards had already left.</p>

  <p>Only the disciples from the Origin Mountain, the Ivory Mountain and the Flow Sword Sect remained.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng showed up, Dorothy approached him eagerly. "It seems like there's something that you've been hiding from me," she said, batting her eyelashes.</p>

  <p>She had thought that she was the one who knew Zheng the most in the Oneness Sky Palace, but now it seemed that she didn't know him at all.</p>

  <p>Athemar and the masters could discover that there was something not right with Zheng and Feng Ge. These elite disciples were no fools and could detect that as well.</p>

  <p>The runes on the giant stones were made from the Imperial Sword Seals, so the problem must be related to the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Feng Ge had utilized a power that was far beyond that of the Instant Enlightenment. They must have known something the others didn't.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at Dorothy. "When the right time comes, I will let you know."</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy was a strong-willed girl, she was not unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"How did you offend Princess Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>"I offended her?" Zheng asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded. "She looked very livid when she came out. Someone mentioned your name and she hit him. Hard."</p>

  <p>She pointed at a place not far from the hall. There was an outline of scorch marks on the side of the pillar, obvious traces of a fight.</p>

  <p>Among the elite disciples, someone guessed that Zheng's victory irritated Feng Ge. Dorothy, however, thought otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Maybe there is some misunderstanding between us," Zheng said carefully. He then recalled how revealing part of the Truth Enlightenment enraged Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Even so, he didn't think he did anything wrong.</p>

  <p>The part of Truth Enlightenment he had shared was deciphered by his son, Geoffrey. Zheng believed he could share it with anyone he wanted.</p>

  <p>"Well, whatever happened between you guys, be careful. After all, she holds a much higher position, Zheng," Dorothy whispered. She was worried that Feng Ge would find a way to get back at Zheng.</p>

  <p>While Feng Ge was not the only daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, she was the most talented one. Because of this, she held a very special position in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Since they had won the first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting, Konnor, Mekhi and other Flow Sword Sect disciples were bustling with excitement. They didn't get back to the sect until late that night.</p>

  <p>When the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect heard they won the championship again, they were all in high spirits.</p>

  <p>In addition to the rewards distributed by Goran, the Oneness Sky Palace was also going to supply them with many resources for the next three years.</p>

  <p>It was definitely worth celebrating the good news!</p>

  <p>In a separate courtyard house, dots of light transformed into colorful butterflies, flitting in the air.</p>

  <p>Milo sat cross legged. With a gentle flick of his wrist, the butterflies gathered all around him. It seemed as though the butterflies were at his beck and call.</p>

  <p>From the end of the courtyard, a slender figure quietly emerged. It was none other than Kate.</p>

  <p>When she saw the colorful butterflies dancing in the air, she looked surprised. "It is extremely tricky to control the Other Shore Token— Luminous Butterfly. Yet, you've managed to master it so quickly!"</p>

  <p>The Luminous Butterfly was an Other Shore Token of the descending type in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. It was very difficult to fuse one's inner world with this Other Shore Token; even if one somehow managed to do it, it would still be difficult to use it.</p>

  <p>Milo opened his eyes, at the sound of her voice. He stretched out one finger, and a fluorescent butterfly landed on his finger. At the same time, he said quietly, "The Flow Sword Sect won the championship again this year."</p>

  <p>"You've been practicing all this time, and yet you're more informed than me!" Kate replied with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>In fact, she did know all about it; she just refused to be the one to inform Milo.</p>

  <p>"The people in the temple on the Other Shore were also talking about this.</p>

  <p>That's how I was informed," said Milo with a smile.</p>

  <p>He had once led the Flow Sword Sect to victory in the Seven Mountains Meeting three years ago. This year, it was Zheng who led them, and they also won first place.</p>

  <p>As a result, many were greatly impressed by what the Flow Sword Sect could do. Winning the Seven Mountains Meeting two times in a row was indeed a great feat, especially considering how the sect was not really considered powerful among all the Oneness Sky Palace's sects.</p>

  <p>It just so happened they had a few extraordinary disciples.</p>

  <p>Kate was lost in thought for a moment before saying, "It is said that the Flow Sword Sect only won first place thanks to Zheng. Konnor had been eliminated early on. That means..."</p>

  <p>"Zheng defeated Feng Ge in the game!" Milo finished her thought for her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he defeated her in the game," Kate repeated with a bright smile on her face. "Don't be stressed out."</p>

  <p>Even Milo wasn't sure just how strong Feng Ge truly was. However, he knew she was a well-matched opponent.</p>

  <p>"I'm constantly under pressure." Milo's tone grew serious. "I am not the most outstanding disciple in the Oneness Sky Palace. There are always many powerful warriors, and Zheng is just one of them. However, according to the rumor, Zheng and Feng Ge seemed to have used a special method to control the giant stones."</p>

  <p>He fell silent, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Since Milo had a perfect fit with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, his control of the giant stone should have reached the limit. How could Zheng and Feng Ge be able to exceed this limit? It was impossible for such a thing to happen.</p>

  <p>"That's why I came to you." Kate pursed her lips.</p>

  <p>"You know the reason?" Milo asked, looking surprised.</p>

  <p>Kate nodded. "It's said that Eastern Emperor Taiyi has finally deciphered the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent."</p>

  <p>Shock registered all over Milo's face, and he was at a loss for words. As a master of Instant Enlightenment, he knew the meaning of the news better.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he finally asked, "Feng Ge could have learned the subsequent chapter from her father, but what about Zheng? How did he get it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had been staying at the Flow Sword Sect, so it was impossible for him to have had a chance to meet Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure. But as far as I know, Zheng has mastered more than Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>That's how he was able to defeat her at the Seven Mountains Meeting,"</p>

  <p>Kate answered.</p>

  <p>Milo could not sit still any longer. He suddenly thought about the time he had to choose among the three sword sects. He knew the Flow Sword Sect was the weakest of the three. However, he also knew that, if he could make a big achievement in the Flow Sword Sect, he could grow stronger than the disciples of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect. That was why he ended up choosing the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>He had always been in search of the most powerful swordsmanship, and had never disappointed others. The subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was like a shining beacon that attracted Milo.</p>

  <p>"It's said that after the Seven Mountains Meeting, Zheng and Feng Ge had a secret talk with the elders, including Goran and Athemar. They probably tried to get to the bottom of the matter. I wonder if Eastern Emperor Taiyi will expose it to the public."</p>

  <p>If the subsequent chapter was deciphered thoroughly, it would have a great impact on the Oneness Sky Palace. It would be impossible for Eastern Emperor Taiyi to hide it from the others.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if Eastern Emperor Taiyi will share it with the public," Milo said, his eyes flashing with passion. "I just want to learn it now."</p>
