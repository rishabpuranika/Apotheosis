<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2062 Wishing Spell (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Across the sky it was a tangled melee among the Supreme Lords. To the eyes of the mortals below, it looked to be a free-for-all among the most powerful in the universe.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the sky, searching. His gaze finally landed on his target in the battle zone. He stood behind the chaos, the Great Weighty Sword loosely held in his hand.</p>

  <p>There were five shallow finger imprints on the broad blade of the sword.</p>

  <p>They had been left there by Pranav when he grabbed it with just his hand. Luo Zheng's understanding of a True God was rough at best, but the power of Pranav far exceeded his expectation. He wondered what other surprises the True God had up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Glancing over to his left, Luo Luo Zheng saw Wynn surrounded by oval shaped stars. Wynn stood at the center of the stars as they revolved around him.</p>

  <p>Sharp light emanated from the middle of the stars and extended out into points as if they were long spears. He was readying for a fight.</p>

  <p>Pranav summoned five eyeballs around himself, each the size of a fist and of different colors. They represented the Five Elements Divine Dao: silver for metal, green for wood, blue for water, red for fire, and brown for earth. All were refined from the eyeballs of a five-colored peacock.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never laid eyes on such a weapon before.</p>

  <p>Each time the eyes met the other's gaze, a beam of five-colored light would fly towards Wynn. However, Wynn was faster and able to dodge each time.</p>

  <p>He had been correct. Pranav, although incredibly powerful, was no match for Wynn. He had a strength and battle prowess unheard of, and was easily able to thwart the enemy's attacks.</p>

  <p>The sky roared once again.</p>

  <p>Xun and Luo Luo Zheng looked away from Wynn and Pranav to see nine Genuine Dragons surge through the battlefield. They were resisting the array of eight Sacred Supreme Lords, their heavenly bodies easily deflecting spells and weapons. Another roar followed them through the sky, and the fighting stopped for a single moment. The Ancestral Dragon had joined the blood bath, and it changed everything.</p>

  <p>A flash of light shot across the sky and then disappeared to reveal the unreachable pagoda. The Buddhist light dimly glowed along the walls of the building, casting an eerie light over the land.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the pagoda was enough of a distraction for the Thoughtless Minds to act. They quickly arranged the Star Destroying Array, meteorites streaking across the sky in flames.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy, Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord Mathias, and Supreme Lord Leia began to make use of their own unique talents.</p>

  <p>A fierce and bloody battle waged between the leader of the Celestial Position race and the Grand Supreme Lord. Above them the sky opened further, and Luo Luo Zheng watched in amazement as the Evolution Lotus Flower and the spinulose wood fern appeared. They continuously collided as the momentums of the two universes crashed into each other.</p>

  <p>More explosions rang in their ears, the booming sounds nearly painful.</p>

  <p>As the battle progressed, the Supreme Lords locked in battle had scattered. Now it wasn't only one supreme world affected, but a number of them were experiencing the chaos of war.</p>

  <p>The terrifying power of the Supreme Lords was beginning to take its toll.</p>

  <p>It was too overpowering, and the supreme worlds began to crack and break apart under the assault.</p>

  <p>No mortal had the chance or ability to resist the attacks on their world.</p>

  <p>There was no amount of prayer that would help them. The Gods were no longer listening as they were the reason for their downfall. Fear permeated the air as the ground shook and crumbled beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>Death was imminent. The weak and average would perish, animals and humans alike. Sacred places would cease to exist and kingdoms would be leveled. Very few would survive this cataclysmic event.</p>

  <p>It had taken only two hours to utterly destroy over three hundred supreme worlds. Only two hours to kill millions. But the battle still continued.</p>

  <p>Those from the ground that could aide in battle did. Xun, with the assistance of Supreme Lord Healum, joined the fight. She had even managed to cut down one of the Sacred Supreme Lords who was besieged.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained on the boulder, uninterested in the fight above him. He was only interested in one battle. His gaze shifted to where Pranav stood, hatred making his vision go red.</p>

  <p>Wynn, who had had the upper hand for most of their fight, was beginning to lose momentum. Their enemy had a trick up his sleeve, and activated some kind of secret technique. Neither Wynn nor Luo Luo Zheng had seen anything like it. Luo Luo Zheng could see the fear peeking out from Wynn's stony expression as Pranav took the upper hand.</p>

  <p>A sound like a swarm of bees came from Pranav's direction.</p>

  <p>The eyes surrounding Pranav began to flutter and move away from their master. They moved and intersected one another, and the closer they came to Wynn, the faster they moved. Wynn could go nowhere as they encircled him, trapping him in a loose circle.</p>

  <p>It was not going to be easy, but Pranav hoped to defeat Wynn without the assistance of his master's other disciples. He knew he was weaker than his opponent. It was why this battle was a test of his strength and ability.</p>

  <p>His master was always watching, always assessing him. He considered this to be a training exercise, so Pranav would prove himself worthy.</p>

  <p>"Five-element Energy Seal!" Pranav's booming voice echoed through the sky.</p>

  <p>The eyes began to circle faster, the humming sound getting louder.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took a single step forward, eyes wide. "That's not good."</p>

  <p>Crowding closer to Wynn, the eyes connected to one another, morphing into a solid ring of five colors. Wynn's expression was grave as he twisted his hands in an intricate pattern. It would be his only attempt to escape from the seal. If this failed, well, he didn't want to think of that.</p>

  <p>"This Five-element Energy Seal is one of my master's secret techniques.</p>

  <p>How could a low-rank True God like you escape from it?" Wynn glared at the implication that Pranav thought him to be weak. A cold laugh sent a shiver up Wynn's and Luo Zheng's spines. Pranav thought this battle was as good as over, and victory would be his. He puffed up his chest and rolled his shoulders, gathering as much of his power into his body as he could.</p>

  <p>It was going to be such a simple task to kill Wynn.</p>

  <p>Once Wynn was dead, the battle would be over. Or so Pranav believed.</p>

  <p>He did not bother to think of the Supreme Lords battling throughout the sky. They were not his concern and were wasting their lives fighting in this battle.</p>

  <p>"Now! Supreme Lord Healum, you have to get me over there!" Luo Luo Zheng looked at Supreme Lord Healum with determination.</p>

  <p>This was his only chance. Pranav was arrogant and self-assured of his victory, so it would be easy for Luo Luo Zheng to swoop in unannounced and surprise him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum connected himself to Luo Luo Zheng with the Space Lock.</p>

  <p>But after he heard the words that had been spoken, he wasn't sure if he should send Luo Luo Zheng into battle against such a powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>"There's no time to hesitate,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng urged. This was what he had been waiting for. A chance at revenge.</p>

  <p>His heart stuttered in his chest, the fear Supreme Lord Healum felt clear on his face. He did not wish to send Luo Luo Zheng into the middle of a battle between two True Gods. However, he'd also witnessed the hidden strength in Luo Luo Zheng and the amazing feats he had managed to perform.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he should believe in Luo Luo Zheng to pull through once more.</p>

  <p>Nodding to Luo Luo Zheng, he gave him an encouraging smile. Hopefully it would give him enough luck to be successful in this crazy endeavor. It took only a second and very little of Supreme Lord Healum's power, and Luo Luo Zheng disappeared from the boulder.</p>

  <p>While Supreme Lord Healum had hesitated, Pranav had summoned five short swords before him, each corresponding with one of the eyes in color. The moment he waved his hand, the swords would shoot forward and pierce in the Five-element Energy Seal. As the seal trapped Wynn's Godly Tile, his source of power, he would be too weak to stop the attack.</p>

  <p>A wicked smile spread across Pranav's face.</p>

  <p>Before he could deploy his attack, a force at his back broke his concentration and made him stumble forward. He didn't have time to turn around when he heard a voice ring out, "Wishing Spell!" His eyes widened when he realized it was that brat Luo Luo Zheng. "I wish that the one hundred thousand supreme worlds would be eternal. I will do everything in my power and even sacrifice my life to exterminate the foreign race who has invaded!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had learned to use the Wishing Spell while in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>He had never used the spell as the side effects were unpredictable, and it would exhaust much of his strength. However, he had no other choice now. In order to defeat Pranav he had to use it.</p>
