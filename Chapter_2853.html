  <p>
</p>

  <p>Joy's heart ached. She took Aleyna into her arms to comfort her. It was unfortunate that Aleyna and her sister had such a father.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, Zheng, my father..." Liusu said, sniffling in Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I know. I know everything," Zheng interrupted in a soothing voice.</p>

  <p>He had read Liusu's memories, so he already knew what she was thinking.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Yudie, Margaret, and the others exchanged a meaningful look with one another.</p>

  <p>Although Liusu had guessed that her father had attacked her, she didn't know what had happened exactly.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly gave Liusu and Aleyna a full account of what had happened. After finally learning the ins and outs of the matter, the two women burst into tears again, heartbroken over how their father had treated them.</p>

  <p>The mark that had been left on them had already been erased by Zheng in the black water.</p>

  <p>Samuel had no idea that his two daughters had returned to their normal state.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he and Rosie arrived at the edge of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Watching the waves formed by colorful time fragments, Rosie couldn't help but let out an appreciative sigh.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the Time Sea hadn't been so vast.</p>

  <p>She used to live by the sea back then.</p>

  <p>The ordinary True Gods who wanted to cross the boundless Time Sea had to rely on the ferrymen of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>Even the top-rank and consummate True Gods couldn't fly or use Grand Teleportation; however, Holy Beings could.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Samuel said gruffly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Samuel, Pascal, and Rosie suddenly vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>The next moment, they found themselves in the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the disciples of the Han Clan had no knowledge of Samuel's rebellious actions.</p>

  <p>In recent days, the people of the Han Clan had been panicked and worried about the safety of their Holy Emperor, just like the disciples of the other powerful clans.</p>

  <p>The moment Samuel appeared on the Floating Island, he let his aura spread out through the land to alert the disciples of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Alfredo, who was practicing in a quiet room, immediately sensed Samuel's aura and rushed out of the room, his eyes lighting up in joy.</p>

  <p>"All the disciples of the Han Clan, come here to see me!" Samuel's low voice was transmitted to each of the disciples.</p>

  <p>In no time, all of them gathered in the center of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Han Clan, like Alfredo, came as well.</p>

  <p>When they noticed the woman who was standing beside Samuel, their eyes flashed with surprise. It was obvious from her aura that she was a fierce being from the Abyss Demon Region. They wondered how their Holy Emperor had brought her out.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Holy Emperor. You're finally back," greeted Alfredo with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>He hadn't gone along with the alliance of the powerful clans to explore the Abyss Demon Region. When he had learned that Nicholas was dead, he had been overwhelmed with worry.</p>

  <p>After all, Joy was gone, and he, being a mere consummate True God, simply couldn't take charge of the overall situation. Compared to the other powerful clans, the Han Clan was too weak. So naturally, he was happy to see their leader again.</p>

  <p>Samuel smiled and said, "How is everything going in our clan?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is fine," Alfredo replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Good." Samuel glanced at the disciples and said, "All those on and above top-rank True God Realm, leave the Floating Island with me!"</p>

  <p>A look of puzzlement appeared on the faces of all the disciples.</p>

  <p>'Leave the Floating Island?'</p>

  <p>'To where? We don't need to leave the Floating Island if the Holy Emperor wants to go to a forbidden land.'</p>

  <p>'The transmission array of the Abyss Demon Region has been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Do we have to go to the Abyss Demon Region with the Holy Emperor?'</p>

  <p>The disciples kept speculating in their minds.</p>

  <p>Even Alfredo was confused.</p>

  <p>After letting his words sink in, Samuel continued, "Come with me to plunder the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, all the disciples were shocked.</p>

  <p>Was Samuel out of mind?</p>

  <p>He wanted to plunder the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan? What was he doing? Was he planning to fight against the alliance of the powerful clans? The Holy Emperor of the Dongfang Clan had died, but the other Holy Beings of the alliance might still be alive, so naturally, everyone was confused.</p>

  <p>Alfredo was also stunned. He looked at Samuel with a serious look and asked, "Holy Emperor, what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nicholas is dead. We have control of the Abyss Demon Region," Samuel said lightly, as if it was no big deal.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, Pascal raised his hand.</p>

  <p>Streaks of black light spread out of the ring in his hand and slowly came together, forming two enormous wings.</p>

  <p>Then, a terrifying amount of power poured out of them.</p>

  <p>The light was so huge and bright that it was visible from the other Floating Islands as well. The people on the other Floating Islands all looked at the Floating Island of the Han Clan with horror on their faces.</p>

  <p>In a pavilion of the Sword Clan, Gibson, one of the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan, abruptly opened his eyes. Then, with a flash, he leaped high up into the sky and looked over at what was happening.</p>

  <p>Some of the elders of the Sword Clan also joined him in the air to watch the Floating Island of the Han Clan. They were all shocked by the terrifying amount of power.</p>

  <p>"It's from the Han Clan," one of the elders said.</p>

  <p>"What the hell could possess such terrifying power?" another one remarked.</p>

  <p>Gibson shook his head with a serious expression and said, "Maybe it has something to do with the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>Just like the people of the Sword Clan, the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings on the other Floating Islands were also afraid of the power that had been unleashed on the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"From now on, the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, and even the entire Time Sea and the divine land all belong to our clan! Except for me, no one else in the divine land can dare to be a Holy Being!" Samuel declared excitedly.</p>

  <p>As the power of the ring in Pascal's hand intensified, the disciples of the Han Clan watched in a mixture of shock and awe.</p>

  <p>"Our clan dominates the divine land now?"</p>

  <p>"We have surpassed the Dongfang Clan?"</p>

  <p>"More than that. Although the Dongfang Clan was the leader of the alliance of powerful clans in the past, it didn't dominate the Time Sea or the divine land."</p>

  <p>His words immediately had an effect on the disciples of the Han Clan; they were now itching to go over to the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, which was the richest and most prosperous place in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>If Samuel was personally leading them to plunder it, it would be a great opportunity to make a fortune!</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Han Clan, follow me!"</p>

  <p>Samuel said as he pointed at the sky with his finger and produced a space channel that led directly to the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Then, he disappeared with Pascal and Rosie.</p>

  <p>As for the disciples of the Han Clan, they were all overcome with greed and rushed into the space channel one after another. Although Samuel had only called for those on and above top-rank True God Realm to accompany him, none of them wanted to give up such a good opportunity.</p>

  <p>Even the low-rank True Gods and proving godly warriors rushed in.</p>

  <p>However, when they arrived at the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, they stopped, not daring to go any closer.</p>

  <p>Sitting right in front of them was a Holy Being Pierson.</p>

  <p>In addition to Pierson, there were two Demi-holy Beings, several consummate True Gods, and hundreds of top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>All of them were dressed in black and had a look of determination on their faces. They reckoned themselves to be the daredevils of the Dongfang Clan.</p>
