<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng, the Feather Holy Sea was a mystery. He wondered how such a small inland sea could gather so many secret lands.</p>

  <p>After hearing Francis' words, he became even more curious. What really was the Feather Holy Sea? They were all under the same impression that ordinary warriors weren't even allowed once to glance at it. Was it true that one could die right after looking at it?</p>

  <p>The idea was somewhat ridiculous for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is the entire Feather Holy Sea surrounded by these city walls?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, crossing his arms on his chest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the city walls have been built in a complete circle, tightly surrounding the entire Feather Holy Sea. Hovering over the place is a farfetched task, as a no-fly ban is imposed. Once anyone breaks the rule, Life and Death Realm masters will come rushing to the scene," Francis answered.</p>

  <p>Truly, the vastness of the city walls around an inland sea was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Hearing this surprised Luo Zheng all the more. Wasn't that a bit too exaggerated?</p>

  <p>What kind of treasures were tucked in the Feather Holy Sea that made all risks they took worth it?</p>

  <p>The divine kingdoms' war kings and war emperors weren't a bunch of idiots. There was a reason behind everything that they had done.</p>

  <p>The more curious Luo Zheng became, the more urge he grew to go and have a look for himself. He wanted to see for himself. What was the Feather Holy Sea all about?</p>

  <p>"Are you thinking of breaking this no-fly ban? Let's say you get past the Life and Death Realm warriors. The Soul Sea Realm warriors will appear next! Coming one after the other just to make sure you don't find anything.</p>

  <p>It's too dangerous," Francis warned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and laughed. He understood Francis quite well, and he knew that it really was dangerous. To do something like that was a stupid idea. Francis told him days ago that if he were to forcefully break through the Feather Holy Sea, it could attract war emperors, too. Hence, he could lose his chance of getting in the Feather Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng left the city walls. It took him about five minutes to finally locate the legendary Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>The Jade Martial House was equivalent to a sixth-grade sect. Its front door was built in such an unusual style, and countless warriors knelt in front.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the view, Luo Zheng realized that there were more than ten thousand warriors kneeling on the ground, and most of them were at the Illuminating Soul and Internal Elixir Realms. He frowned at the scene before him and asked, "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"The Jade Martial House is the martial arts sacred land of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. These warriors want to enter, but they failed to meet the requirements. They only hope that their sincerity will one day influence the members of the martial house and change their minds," Francis answered.</p>

  <p>What he heard astonished him beyond belief. Those warriors did such a thing just so they could enter a martial house.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Central Region could cultivate themselves through a variety of channels. If one was unable to enter a certain sect, they could join another one or even cultivate on their own.</p>

  <p>As for the divine kingdoms, the martial houses that they supported held absolutely a monopoly overall. If one wanted to cultivate to a higher level, then there was no other way to achieve such a goal other than entering the martial house.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, many warriors were unable to enter the Jade Martial House. They went home with nothing but disappointment.</p>

  <p>One day, there was a warrior who refused to accept his fate, so instead of going home upon rejection, he knelt down in front of the Jade Martial House's entrance.</p>

  <p>For ten long years, that was all he did. Not once did he stop for anything, nor did he let anything stop him from serving his purpose.</p>

  <p>Eventually, an elder of the Jade Martial House was touched by his gesture.</p>

  <p>Even if that particular warrior wasn't the most skilled, he was welcomed into the martial house in the end.</p>

  <p>This earnest behavior and the astonishing story influenced more and more warriors.</p>

  <p>Warriors of inferior talents also fell to their knees after failing to enter the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>Some of them had been there for one or two years, while some for eight or ten. However, the Jade Martial House members didn't take heed of their pleas.</p>

  <p>A warrior's talent was as important as his perseverance. An influential martial house didn't waste its time on the warriors who weren't skillful.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors firmly believed that their sincerity could convince the members otherwise. That was why they still tried to enter the Jade Martial House through that method.</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng, it was kind of absurd. Immediately, he stepped onto the stairs of the martial house and headed straight for the door.</p>

  <p>There were guards standing on both sides of the martial house, and most of them were Internal Elixir Realm warriors. When they noticed that Zheng's cultivation was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm and that a Life and Death Realm master followed close behind him, the expressions on their faces changed. All of them had a look that showed respect towards the two.</p>

  <p>They all guessed that the young man came from a big clan and got there along with his servant to register for the martial house.</p>

  <p>All of them also believed that since Luo Zheng had managed to hire a Life and Death Realm master to be his old servant, his clan must be of immense power. It might even be the royal family.</p>

  <p>Despite all those assumptions, one of the guards still tried to stop Luo Zheng. The guard then politely smiled at Luo Zheng and asked, "May I know your purpose in visiting our Jade Martial House?"</p>

  <p>"I would like to participate in the admission test of the Jade Martial House,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spoke softly.</p>

  <p>"Test?" The guards looked at each other with furrowed eyebrows. One of them said, "Our martial house holds a test every month, but it isn't today.</p>

  <p>You still need to wait for half a month for the next one, and to take part in it, you need…"</p>

  <p>The guard then explained to Luo Zheng the details of the test thoroughly.</p>

  <p>The thing that Luo Zheng was most worried about didn't happen. As long as he was in the divine kingdom, he was to be regarded as a citizen, and the Jade Martial House couldn't possibly reject him. If he passed the test, he could become a member of the martial house.</p>

  <p>In addition, the martial house wasn't a sect, and they didn't have any restrictions or requirements for someone like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was safer to say that those who entered the martial house became its partners, not just disciples. It was natural that the warrior could, later on, have a cooperative relationship with the martial house instead of just obeying it through and through.</p>

  <p>In fact, the four great divine kingdoms also competed with each other.</p>

  <p>Besides the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, they had also invested a great deal of manpower and resources into the other three secret lands. Thus, the competition among the four great divine kingdoms was extremely intense, and all kinds of benefits in the martial houses also increased.</p>

  <p>After he heard the description of the test from the guard, Luo Zheng nodded and left with Francis. Since they were already there, they decided to follow the plan and take action step by step. It was useless for them to be in such a hurry.</p>

  <p>Temporarily, Luo Zheng left that day.</p>

  <p>During the half-month wait, Luo Zheng had also roughly observed the internal structure of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, and his thoughts about it became somewhat clearer.</p>

  <p>There were a total of two sixth-grade martial houses in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. One was located in the capital of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, and the other was the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>The two martial houses held the quota of warriors to enter the Feather Holy Sea. However, it was not easy for him to obtain a spot. He needed to be one of the top martial artists before he got the chance to get the spot.</p>

  <p>The reason for that was because all the warriors who managed to enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land were at least Life and Death Realm masters.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng passed the test and secured a good result in the martial house, he still had to compete with those Life and Death Realm masters if he really wanted to set foot in the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had long anticipated this, but he managed to stay collected. Besides cultivating, he even bought some books with him to learn more about the local customs of the four great divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The more he learned, the more he was advantageous. Opportunities always came to those who prepared well. As Luo Zheng made his way to the Feather Holy Sea to rescue Ning Yudie, he had to be prudent before making any hasty move.</p>

  <p>Relatively speaking, that trip to the four great divine kingdoms was much more comfortable than the one to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, it was clear to Luo Zheng that he was eventually going to compete against the masters.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, Luo Zheng had registered according to the instructions. After he obtained a token, he was finally allowed to walk into the entrance of the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>Just as he did so, four Life and Death Realm warriors aggressively rushed from behind him. When they were in front of Luo Zheng, one of them yelled,</p>

  <p>"Move!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly as he heard the sound coming just right behind where he stood. He turned his head to look and was met with a whip.</p>

  <p>With the same displeased look on his face, Luo Zheng watched Francis as he grabbed the whip. Then, his eyes fell on the person behind the four Life and Death Realm warriors. He was a young man who wore a brocade robe and appeared to be only at the age of seventeen or eighteen. However, he had already reached the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>
