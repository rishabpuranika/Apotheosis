<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not have enough cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had learned from Wurth that if he desired an item, he could join in the bidding. As long as the quoted price was not higher than the cubic crystals he would earn for the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion, Luo Zheng could afford to bid.</p>

  <p>Thus, when Luo Zheng saw the Weapon Refining Principle, he bid against Fren even though the other bidders had ceased.</p>

  <p>20, 100 cubic crystals!</p>

  <p>If this had happened before the incident on Hell Mountain, Luo Zheng would have been reluctant to spend thousands of cubic crystals buying the Weapon Refining Principle. On the contrary, he would have saved these cubic crystals to exchange for points at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>However, after the battle on Hell Mountain, Luo Zheng had realized how large the skill gap was between him and Vale.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to narrow this difference, Luo Zheng had to improve in every aspect.</p>

  <p>Not just his strength!</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could learn how to refine weapons, or even become a master of weapon refining, his request to visit or save Yan might not be denied!</p>

  <p>Admittedly, there were no guarantees that buying and reading the Weapon Refining Principle would help Luo Zheng become a weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did not have many choices. He had to persist with his plan.</p>

  <p>Since learning from the Weapon Refining Principle would give him an advantage, Luo Zheng was determined to buy it.</p>

  <p>"Rest assured, Nory and Sean. I have enough cubic crystals," said Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>Nory's and Sean's foreheads creased as they wondered how Luo Zheng had accumulated tens of thousands of cubic crystals. But when they thought of Zheng's cautious personality, they relaxed slightly.</p>

  <p>Many people darted a curious glance in Zheng's direction when they heard him bid against Fren.</p>

  <p>Astonishment reflected on their faces when they saw that Luo Zheng was just a teenager. What surprised them, even more, was that he was only an outer disciple at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Twenty thousand cubic crystals was a significant amount of wealth anywhere.</p>

  <p>The average family could not put up so much money. The boy with a white robe was a half-step into the nature level. Did he belong to a noble clan?</p>

  <p>Some people whispered and speculated about Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>Fren shot Luo Zheng a sideways glance and called out, "Twenty-one thousand!"</p>

  <p>Several leaders within the Zhuge Clan had asked Fren to buy the book at any cost as it contained detailed knowledge of Chase's work. The Weapon Refining Principle also contained Chase's secrets, especially those related to weapon refining. Thus, attaining the Weapon Refining Principle was of utmost importance to the Zhuge Clan.</p>

  <p>In fact, from Fren's point of view, spending more than twenty thousand cubic crystals on a weapon refining handbook was unreasonable, but he had to obey the order.</p>

  <p>Though he had a calm look, he was furious at Luo Zheng for increasing the price.</p>

  <p>Since Fren had an ulterior motive to buy the book, he could not express his anger at Zheng's actions. Otherwise, his true purpose for securing the book would be revealed to all the bidding opponents and they would be spurred to compete with him to the end. It would not be cost-effective, even though he would buy it, regardless of the price. After all, the auction was, in essence, a psychological game.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Fren's bid had been random, but it had been his strategy.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one thousand and one hundred cubic crystals," Luo Zheng continued to raise his bid.</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice was fairly steady, emotionless, and confident.</p>

  <p>At present, Fren realized that he was in trouble as it seemed that Luo Zheng was going to bid to the end.</p>

  <p>The trouble came not only from the boy but also from the other opponents.</p>

  <p>Although Fren always behaved crazily and ridiculously, those who knew him well understood that madness was just his disguise.</p>

  <p>If Fren continued to compete with Luo Zheng, the price of the Weapon Refining Principle would rise too high, and it would arouse the interest of other noble clans. That was not what Fren wanted.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one thousand and one hundred cubic crystals!" shouted Nestor.</p>

  <p>"Is there a higher bid?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two thousand," Fren called out again, stroking the face of the young woman beside him. "Vivan, get that kid to shut up!"</p>

  <p>Vivan stood and nodded in understanding. Her slim waist swayed seductively as she made her way toward Zheng's room.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two thousand and one hundred!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised the bid by a hundred cubic crystals just as a beautiful woman appeared at the door of his room.</p>

  <p>The beauty smiled as she leaned against the door. Once she had Zheng's attention, she said, "Hey boy, could I talk with you?"</p>

  <p>Nory and Sean were hot-blooded youths. Thus, their hearts beat faster when they saw the enchanting Vivan.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng turned his head and asked Vivan calmly, "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"My master asked me to tell you to give up the bidding," said Vivan, staring straight at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned her smile as he asked, "Why should I give up?"</p>

  <p>"Because my master wants you to," said Vivan. Malicious intent twinkled in her brown eyes.</p>

  <p>What arrogance!</p>

  <p>Zheng's forehead wrinkled when he heard what Vivan said. Since entering Cloud Sect, Luo Zheng had met many arrogant people. He sneered at Vivan,</p>

  <p>"Your master? Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"My master's surname is Zhuge," replied Vivan proudly. The Zhuge Clan was renowned in the Burning Sky Empire, so Vivan thought that Luo Zheng would change his mind after learning that Fren came from the Zhuge Clan.</p>

  <p>"Zhuge?" murmured Luo Zheng. Then his face darkened. From Hell Mountain to the south of the empire, he had clashed with members of the Zhuge Clan many times. They were like annoying leeches that kept clinging to him!</p>

  <p>"Yes, my master is Fren Zhuge. I believe you have heard of him. So, please do not bid again, or you will get into trouble," said Vivan, with a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth.</p>
