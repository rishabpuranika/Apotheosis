<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Luck-devouring Snakes continued to circle in the air, gnawing continuously at Zheng's luck with soft sounds.</p>

  <p>They did not cause any harm to Zheng's physical body, but Zheng's expression became more and more grim...</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>The soft chewing sounds were like those made by a silkworm that nibbled on mulberry leaves. The snakes were wearing down Zheng's luck slowly.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that luck was of great importance to him, but it just so happened that these Luck-devouring Snakes were completely illusory.</p>

  <p>They did not seem to exist in this world, and Luo Zheng could do nothing about them with his current strength.</p>

  <p>Even the cyan dragon in Zheng's mind let out a faint sound resembling a sigh. It was only because Zheng's good fortune was too great that he was facing this terrifying Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation today.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, there had been no method recorded in any ancient books to resolve this tribulation, regardless of which scripture it was.</p>

  <p>Both the cyan dragon and Xun could not think of a way out. This was an unstoppable Heavenly Tribulation. Perhaps no one could resist it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grew worried and was at a loss about what to do. However, as time passed by, he calmed down, gradually composing himself and his slightly anxious state of mind.</p>

  <p>He turned over and coiled his legs in the air. Then he quickly fell down and returned to his original spot, his expression returning to a tranquil one...</p>

  <p>It was not that Luo Zheng had chosen to give up. Ever since he had made up his mind to cultivate the martial arts, he had never once thought about giving up on anything.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the Heavenly Tribulation and his opponent was, they would never make Luo Zheng yield.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tribulation was not a deathly tribulation. Otherwise, most of the warriors in the universe would have died long ago because of it.</p>

  <p>Since the heavens let such a powerful Heavenly Tribulation manifest before him, it must contain a profound meaning. Luo Zheng realized that he had to be calm mentally and observe first, instead of becoming anxious.</p>

  <p>No matter how unlucky he was, he would not die so quickly. This was how he comforted himself silently.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>The Luck-devouring Snakes still gnawed in the air as they slithered around. They seemed to have taken a liking to Zheng's luck. It was like exquisite food to them and they swallowed it one bite at a time...</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is able to maintain his composure. He is truly remarkable," one of the palace leaders pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he has already figured out a way to overcome this," another palace leader said.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha... Forget about Luo Zheng; even the Supreme Lords of the supreme worlds would not be able to think of a solution to such a Heavenly Tribulation. Such a thing should not even exist in the universe!" the palace leader, who had spoken previously, remarked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's state of mind was like a peaceful ancient well, without any fluctuations.</p>

  <p>The Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation was a catastrophe that fell on him, but he was using the snakes to train his state of mind, so that he would still be all right and powerful, even if he lost the protection of his good luck.</p>

  <p>Luck indeed had a role in making miracles happen at times, but Luo Zheng had not relied solely on it to achieve so much and become so remarkable.</p>

  <p>Without luck, he might find it more arduous to cultivate in the future, which meant that he would encounter an even more difficult challenge.</p>

  <p>But so what?</p>

  <p>'So what?'</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Zheng opened his eyes once again. A profound look entered them. While he was in the face of this irresistible tribulation, his warrior spirit once again ascended to the higher level.</p>

  <p>This was a contest between gains and losses. Luo Zheng realized that he could still give it a try even if he was unable to succeed.</p>

  <p>Layla stood right in front of Luo Zheng. When she met his eyes, she got shocked. Her heart started beating rapidly.</p>

  <p>She could not figure out what Luo Zheng was thinking, but his eyes were filled with determination and an emotion more complex.</p>

  <p>What happened to Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>A mystery arose in Layla's heart. She did not know what Luo Zheng had experienced in this short period of time.</p>

  <p>Not only Layla, but the other warriors of the thirteen palaces were baffled as well. Their hearts raced inadvertently as they glanced at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clap, clap, clap... The lord of the Sunset World clapped his hands suddenly. "The boy is remarkable! He knows full well that he's unable to fight the Luck-devouring Snakes, but he is still honing his mind by the use of them. His warrior spirit must have advanced greatly."</p>

  <p>Very few warriors were able to keep calm under such circumstances. Not only that, but Luo Zheng was also trying to hone himself. Thus, the lord of the Sunset World could not help but cheer for him...</p>

  <p>Every warrior had a different personality. Their mental states were greatly different as well. As for the lord of the Sunset World, he was straightforward and always praised the people he admired. Yolande, on the other hand, was a reserved person, so when she saw Zheng's outstanding performance, she simply smiled. Without doubt, however, they all admired what Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>Even as Zheng's state of mind underwent another transformation, the Luck-devouring Snakes continued to gnaw in the air. For them, the feast was far from over, but Luo Zheng himself did not care about that anymore.</p>

  <p>After over ten minutes, however, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>Huff...</p>

  <p>A light breeze suddenly swept over them.</p>

  <p>The wind gathered around Zheng's body and began to spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>When the wind swept through Layla's hair, a hint of doubt appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>'The wind is blowing, but where is it coming from?' she wondered in confusion.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked puzzled. The place had been completely sealed by the old man in cotton robes, so the wind from outside could not blow in here.</p>

  <p>Every warrior stood there quietly, without deploying their cultivation methods. They could not disturb the airflow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng too did not make the slightest movement. Instead, he calmly sat on the spot like a stone.</p>

  <p>Compared to the warriors of the thirteen palaces, the group of palace leaders and the Sunset World lord were much stronger. They were countless times more sensitive than the warriors.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World stared at Luo Zheng and said, "This wind is coming from behind Luo Zheng. There's something there."</p>

  <p>"I don't see it. It is completely empty there. There's nothing to be seen."</p>

  <p>The other palace leader took a glance at the spot, firmly believing his judgment.</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders also nodded. "Indeed, there's nothing out of the ordinary behind Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>But the wind was real. It was not the Law Power formed by life vitality.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if some extremely powerful creature was about to be born, causing the airflow to become chaotic.</p>

  <p>The wind became sharper and fiercer while everyone looked on curiously. Its intensity became stronger and stronger. It had gradually turned from a gentle breeze into a mighty gale.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff, huff…</p>

  <p>The strong wind spiraled around the crowd, emitting loud sounds.</p>

  <p>In fact, the warriors— by relying on their own comprehension of the Law Power— could summon a hurricane ten thousand times stronger than this strong gale with a single thought.</p>

  <p>However, no one knew where this gust of wind came from and how it was formed. It was all too strange.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was wondering about this, a warrior suddenly pointed at Zheng's back and said, "Look! What is that?!"</p>

  <p>Behind Luo Zheng was nothing. However, it was precisely because of this that the situation seemed even stranger.</p>

  <p>The strong wind was howling non-stop, and as it blew to every corner, it inevitably brought up a bit of dust. Everything became a bit blurry all of a sudden, but many warriors could still see their surroundings.</p>

  <p>When the strong wind blew behind Luo Zheng, they discovered something strange.</p>

  <p>The wind seemed unable to pass through Zheng's back. This was because the wind, which carried traces of dust with it, had drawn a faint shadow behind Luo Zheng. It was the shadow of a giant.</p>

  <p>Or at least, it was what could be called a shadow in some ways. The wind could not penetrate it, and a faint virtual outline had been drawn.</p>

  <p>It was quite a coincidence that the Luck-devouring Snakes were nibbling along this outline. It looked like they were gnawing on a nonexistent giant!</p>

  <p>When he heard the voices of the crowd, the expression on Zheng's face remained calm. However, as he turned his head to take a look, his eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>The outline of a giant? What was this about?</p>

  <p>Since the Luck-devouring Snakes were devouring on the giant, could this shadow be called his luck?</p>

  <p>Why did his luck assume this form?</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was able to maintain his composure, he could not help but be perplexed when he saw this strange scene.</p>

  <p>More importantly, since when had this shadow been following him?</p>
