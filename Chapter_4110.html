<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4110 Suspicion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man was stunned. After a few moments, the young man in cyan robes next to him urged, "Old man, what did he or she say?"</p>

  <p>"Human race, he or she is from the human race," the old man replied.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed as he stared at the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>These two words contained so much information that both the old man and the young man tried to think harder.</p>

  <p>Human spirits were equivalent to the "humans" of the main world, but they never recognized themselves as human race.</p>

  <p>Many arrogant human spirits even insisted that they were completely different from the human race.</p>

  <p>This kind of situation was usual among the monkey spirits, the bird spirits, and the snake spirits. Some spirits in the Four Spirits Sect had a natural sense of superiority. They never agreed that the races from the secondary worlds were their kind.</p>

  <p>"Did you come from the chaos?" the old man asked a second question.</p>

  <p>The person at the other end of the light answered him in a slow and troublesome manner. The old man was afraid that problems might occur if he asked too many questions, so he only asked one by one.</p>

  <p>The gaze behind the Lone Sword began to flicker intermittently.</p>

  <p>After a while of observing the flicker, the old man got the answer. It was "yes".</p>

  <p>"Since you are from the chaos, how did you get out?" the old man continued.</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan robes came to a strong realization. The human outside was really his kind!</p>

  <p>The problem was, the chaos was a closed world.</p>

  <p>How in the world could one get a chance out of a closed world? 'That human probably met an unforeseen opportunity, ' the young man thought.</p>

  <p>As the gaze flickered some more, the old man once again received a brief answer.</p>

  <p>"I just crawled out."</p>

  <p>The old man could not hide his amazement precisely because he had been to the main world.</p>

  <p>He knew it was impossible to just crawl out of the chaos.</p>

  <p>It was already difficult to break the barrier between the Other Shore and the chaos, let alone the barrier between the chaos and the main world.</p>

  <p>The old man felt the other party might have been fooling him so he reminded himself to be vigilant.</p>

  <p>It might be someone who worked for the snake spirits.</p>

  <p>They might have found a way to return to the main world and get back to the four pillars. They were trying to confirm their location through Other Shore Tokens and it was a very dangerous act.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only the old man who doubted the other party. Geoffrey on the other end was also conflicted in answering the questions.</p>

  <p>He felt uncertain about the other party's purpose.</p>

  <p>Ziya didn't tell him that the secrets of the Deleting Space could not be disclosed, because it was almost impossible for him to come into contact with anyone.</p>

  <p>But he was not stupid. It was risky to expose such a secret to outsiders.</p>

  <p>This old man might not be trustworthy.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of suspicion as they approached each other. This caused a gradual unease in their communication.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get out?</p>

  <p>What's your name?</p>

  <p>Can you roam freely in the main world? Can you climb up that pillar?"</p>

  <p>The old man asked several questions in a row, but Geoffrey stopped answering any of them.</p>

  <p>He put his finger on the red light and silently watched the two of them.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Geoffrey decided to fiddle with it again. "Who are you? Are you humans from the Source World?"</p>

  <p>The old man smiled bitterly at the response. It turned out that the other party was also doubtful of him.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't matter if the other party found out about his identity.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect knew him and had been looking for him anyway.</p>

  <p>"I'm the leader of the Human Sect, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord," he replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing the name, Geoffrey tried to recall and soon gave up. "I've never heard of it."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had never mentioned this name, and Ziya never said he had such an uncle.</p>

  <p>The old man wasn't surprised at all.</p>

  <p>Although he was famous in the 77th chaotic era, he had been hiding in the Jade Pure Realm for so long. Times had changed and legends about him had long been lost in history.</p>

  <p>They exchanged several questions but remained on their guard and avoided sensitive problems. It was more like they tested each other until the conversation began to lead nowhere.</p>

  <p>"The less trouble, the better..."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey muttered. He knew he'd better finish his goal first.</p>

  <p>He had climbed the pillar for so long and ought not to waste time on this accident.</p>

  <p>Just as Geoffrey was about to end the conversation and pull his fingers from the red light, the big bell in the Divine Bell City of the Ruin Graveyard suddenly clanged.</p>

  <p>It was Tianming.</p>

  <p>In only a short period, he had already made progress again.</p>

  <p>The Bell Ringing Meeting in the Divine Bell City was held every month.</p>

  <p>It was not yet the day, but after Tianming broke through, the force ruling the Ruin Graveyard made an exception for him.</p>

  <p>As expected, he had successfully entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>The old man and the young man in cyan robes didn't expect the bell to ring, and they had never revealed themselves to others before. The old man gently waved his hand and used a deceptive trick to disable Tianming from seeing them.</p>

  <p>Tianming showed great excitement, ringing the bell with all his might.</p>

  <p>He knew that his cultivation level had advanced so fast, all thanks to the Monta Stone.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Yellow Tower was indeed helping him!</p>

  <p>The Monta Stone was by no means an ordinary strengthening-type Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>After entering the thirty-second floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he did not intend to carry any Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Monta Stone, he became confident to break through the topmost part of the tower - the thirty-third floor!</p>

  <p>Naturally, those who were good at swordsmanship were sensitive to swords.</p>

  <p>Tianming had glanced at the Lone Sword hanging at the thirty-third floor too many times from afar.</p>

  <p>The simple sword must have incredible power!</p>

  <p>'It won't be long before I take off this sword myself, ' Tianming thought as he observed.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was getting ready to leave when he noticed another presence.</p>

  <p>He never thought that an acquaintance of his would suddenly arrive in the tower?Uncle Tianming!</p>

  <p>Although he didn't have much interaction with Tianming, they had spent some time in the Cloud Hall and the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Why is Uncle Tianming in this tower?" he almost cried out.</p>

  <p>This was the first acquaintance he had seen through the light.</p>

  <p>Tianming wandered around the Mysterious Yellow Tower for a while before he withdrew from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He was unaware and didn't feel anything unusual.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey paused for a while, thinking whether he should say something or not. Finally, he made up his mind to move the red light again.</p>

  <p>"I know him! Tianming!"</p>

  <p>After getting this information through the flicker of the gaze, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was puzzled.</p>

  <p>What the hell...</p>

  <p>How could the guy behind the Lone Sword know Tianming?</p>

  <p>Geoffrey continued sending messages through the light as his emotions stirred.</p>

  <p>About a quarter of an hour later, the old man burst into laughter when Geoffrey finished.</p>

  <p>"That's great! Really great!</p>

  <p>My nephew has actually done such a feat! I didn't expect such a coincidence in the world!</p>

  <p>Hahaha..." he exclaimed while raising his fists just like he won something.</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan robes didn't dare to interrupt and stayed silent.</p>

  <p>After a while, he could no longer help himself from asking. "What is it, old man? Who is the nephew you mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"Ziya!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord beamed with pride. It was as if he had never been so happy in the past tens of millions of years.</p>

  <p>"Ziya? He is still alive?" The young man in cyan robes blinked as he was also shocked.</p>
