<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3402 The Eligible Targets </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been a while since the huge eye was silently observing the events below it, to embed every living creature in the main peak to its vision.</p>

  <p>A huge ball rested under this eye, which was actually a big and powerful Chaotic Source Spirit. It measured more than a hundred feet in size, different from an ordinary one of its kind. This large ball was clearly the mother of all the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The voice of the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits broke the silence in the air. "Have you found the eligible targets?"</p>

  <p>The huge eye flashed and sent out a part of its consciousness in response.</p>

  <p>The eye had no organs to speak, so it could only send messages through its consciousness.</p>

  <p>"I have many qualified targets in mind now," said the huge eye.</p>

  <p>"Let me see!" the mother demanded. Red and white lights inside the huge eye descended in front of the mother and drew a graceful figure.</p>

  <p>It was Yan, who wore a long dress.</p>

  <p>The light figure showed that she was climbing up the cave, leading the members of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>"This is a human girl who cultivates the Truth of Holy Words. She has the blood of the Snake Goddess," the huge eye explained.</p>

  <p>The mother nodded, then started to count, "One."</p>

  <p>Buzz…</p>

  <p>The red and white lights flashed again and revealed another figure.</p>

  <p>This time, it was a white-haired young man. It was none other than Khalid from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"A man of the Bearing race, who cultivates the Truth of Five Orientations, owns the Five-Orientation Body, and is one of the inheritors of the Yellow Thearch."</p>

  <p>"Two," the mother said with a blank expression.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The lights flashed some more and showed the top masters of the minor races, and the huge eye had been targeting all of them.</p>

  <p>"There are eleven in total. What about the targets for yourself?" asked the mother.</p>

  <p>The eye smiled. "Me? Well... I am interested in this guy."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The huge eye flashed and Zheng's figure appeared, which was outlined by red and white lights.</p>

  <p>"Is he also one of the human race? Why did you choose him?" the mother asked and looked at Zheng in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"This man is very interesting. He has merged with something of my kind," said the giant eye with its consciousness.</p>

  <p>The mother was visibly shocked at this news, "You mean he has merged with an Eye of Will?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. If I'm not mistaken, he must have assimilated an Eye of Will when he was in the Sacred Mallow Temple!" the huge eye answered affirmatively.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, was not interested in the giant eye's chosen target. Instead she asked, "Are you sure that we can escape safely after we possess their bodies? There are supreme masters who stay outside the Chaotic Source World. I can sense them," the mother said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, it's just Human Sovereign who's on guard outside. I'm afraid he can't keep us here if he is alone!" It seemed that there was a hint of contempt in the huge eye's words.</p>

  <p>"That's good," the mother hissed. She turned to look at the phantoms of the eligible targets, and the hatred in her only grew even more. "We Chaotic Source Spirits have been kept in this place, while they slaughter and trample us at will. Now, it's time for them to pay the price and have a taste of this kind of life! You bastards want to absorb us? Let's see if you are qualified first!"</p>

  <p>Normally, creatures of the Other Shore could not enter the Source World.</p>

  <p>Yet, the Chaotic Source Spirit itself was quite special. After the Snake Goddess had discovered it, their pack had been nurtured carefully and grew to a great number.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Chaotic Source Spirits had helped nurture countless masters in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Despite such a deed, life in the Source World was cruel for them.</p>

  <p>Their true bodies were locked in the powerful Chaotic Source Sea on Stage Twenty-two. They couldn't even move in the slightest--but as a kind of Other Shore Token, they descended in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for the accident a few years ago, then Chaotic Source Spirits would have been enslaved and kept in captivity for more generations.</p>

  <p>During that time, one powerful master had killed the guardian of the Chaotic Source Sea and freed all the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The mother was the core of the Chaotic Source Spirits. She wanted to bring all the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the Other Shore and stop them from being the Other Shore Tokens for good. She wanted to end their miserable lives.</p>

  <p>However, the master who had saved them refused the mother's request and asked the Chaotic Source Spirits to maintain what they had been doing.</p>

  <p>The mother was confused, until a huge eye--the Dreaded Eye Demon, appeared.</p>

  <p>To descend in the Source World, creatures of the Other Shore required some warriors to support them, or in other words, they needed a complete inner world for support. Thus, the mother was very curious as to how the Dreaded Eye Demon had broken through the Other Shore's restrictions and arrived at where they were now.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Dreaded Eye Demon brought a task for them when it came-</p>

  <p>-to devour the top talents in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Chaotic Source Spirits were very excited when they heard the news.</p>

  <p>Those damned creatures had devoured them for so long, and finally there was a day that they could devour them back. It was what the Chaotic Source Spirits had been dreaming of doing, but they couldn't do so, until the huge eye had arrived.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits didn't have the ability to bite back, but the giant eye could. It turned out that the master who had freed them had already found the escape route in advance.</p>

  <p>It was usually the mother's strategy to spread the plenty of Chaotic Source Spirits across the four peaks in the north, east, west, and south, in order to protect as many of them as possible.</p>

  <p>As for those warriors who entered the main peak without permission, the mother would lead all the other Chaotic Source Spirits to fight back!</p>

  <p>This time, however, was different. Now, the mother took all the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the main peak so they could attract those talents to their location. The tests in the caves and passageways were nothing more than observation methods to select the best talents. At this point, the giant eye had already chosen the targets suitable for their consumption.</p>

  <p>Below the huge eye's hideaway, creatures of various races had entered the main peak one after another. All of them encountered the same situations as Zheng and the others had.</p>

  <p>It was relatively late when the Evil God had entered the main peak.</p>

  <p>It was known that the members of the Separate Abyss race were incomparable to those of the ordinary forces. Four members of their race had very special Other Shore Tokens. Those four relied on each other and formed a perfect circle. They were so strong that the strength they showed through the circle was enough to kill the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The Evil God fought against them and although he tried his best, he had only seriously injured one of them. In the end, he had to retreat.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that the Evil God couldn't defeat warriors who were at the same level as him!</p>

  <p>Still, the Evil God didn't care about it at all. After all, he had already killed a large number of people in the Chaotic Source World and obtained so much. What he only had to do now was to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were rock giants that blocked Zheng and his group's path along their journey.</p>

  <p>The rock giants didn't hinder Zheng and his companions, but the warriors didn't get many Chaotic Source Spirits from them, either.</p>

  <p>They had soon climbed a distance of twenty thousand feet up the cave, but only got a little more than ninety Chaotic Source Spirits. It was not enough for any of them when the gain was to be shared.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng wasn't discouraged at all.</p>

  <p>The remaining hundreds of thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding somewhere on the main peak, waiting for them to harvest.</p>

  <p>After they climbed more than thirty thousand feet, they were almost in the middle of the main peak.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to have hollowed out the center of the main peak, as there was a huge hole formed in the middle. As soon as they stepped into the huge cave, they all stopped walking.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of patterns that were engraved on the cave's walls, which made Zheng and his companions feel as if they were in a huge palace.</p>

  <p>"Look at them... What do the patterns stand for?" Sally looked around, her eyes blinking in curiosity. "I've seen these patterns before," said Chaim.</p>

  <p>He continued, "When I was in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm..."</p>

  <p>"They are the sculptures in the Sacred Mallow Temple." Dorothy glanced at Zheng and nodded, "Me and Zheng explored that temple together. I'm sure of it!"</p>
