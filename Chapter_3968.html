<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The relationship between the many non-human races of the Grand Pure Realm and the Element Spirit Civilization was strained at best.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had been the first ones to be born in the chaos, and were the first to enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>They had a longer history than most of the other living creatures in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>The many non-human races of the Grand Pure Realm had once fought fiercely with the Element Spirit Civilization. Some powerful races were able to win and maintain their own, separate status. Some had lost and had to submit to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>As the Element Spirit Civilization grew stronger and stronger, they began to advance on to the Supreme Pure Realm and then the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Because of this, many races in the Grand Pure Realm wanted to curry favor with the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Maple Forest was strong, but the races in it were still hoping to be able to rely on the Element Spirit Civilization's power to help them march onto the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Noticing the needs of these other races, the Element Spirit Civilization gave them many ice pieces. If they ever needed these races' help, they would assign the tasks through them. If the tasks were completed, great rewards awaited them.</p>

  <p>Many times in the past, the tasks assigned by the Element Spirit Civilization were mainly targeted at those of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race had grown exponentially in the recent years though. When the races first chased down the Nihility race, they had believed them to be weak. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven had easily slaughtered many of them during tasks.</p>

  <p>From that point on, everyone was beginning to realize that the Nihility race was as strong as the Element Spirit Civilization. Very few dared to attack them, and the Element Spirit Civilization rarely assigned tasks through the ice pieces anymore.</p>

  <p>A burly bull-headed monster lumbered towards the ice piece and stared at it for a long moment. Greed began to glint in his eyes as he exclaimed,</p>

  <p>"What? The Bone Fragments Secret Soul! I can't believe it!"</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had always been generous with their rewards, and the treasures they offered were always rare and precious. The Bone Fragments Secret Soul was just that, it was no ordinary item. With the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, they would be able to further strengthen and expand their race. They'd maybe even qualify to enter the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>A second monster joined the first, eyes wide with shock. "If Slade is willing to offer such a valuable thing as a reward, I can bet you the target is no ordinary creature..."</p>

  <p>"Not really! It's just a small group of warriors in the Eternal Realm, measly humans. Nothing to be afraid of!" The monster in front of the ice piece replied.</p>

  <p>The humans in the Eternal Realm were nothing to be feared, so the creatures believed. Those of the Grand Pure Realm were only afraid of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, as they should be.</p>

  <p>The other creature seemed to be a little more cautious. "Why would they need to set such a high price if it was a simple task?" he asked. "There's more to it."</p>

  <p>"Of course there's more to it," the first one grunted, turning his head to look over his shoulder at the other. "Apparently, one of these humans just killed Hawley in the Flaming Maple Forest, and left unscathed. That human is the priority target..."</p>

  <p>"The group of humans who killed Hawley?!" Someone yelled from behind them.</p>

  <p>Several other of their kind were not too far away, shocked by this revelation.</p>

  <p>Hawley's death had been shocking news, and spread like wild fire throughout the entirety of the Grand Pure Realm in a matter of days. Those of their race were living closely to the Flaming Maple Forest, so they were the first to know.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed creature standing before the ice piece could sense the fear of his kin. "The Misty River race that resides in the forest is incredibly strong," he shouted, "but they are not worthy of being mentioned outside the forest. Even if Hawley was defeated by the human, it only proves he was physically strong. What the fuck are you all afraid of?!"</p>

  <p>"You're right! Hawley was untouchable only because he never left the forest. Otherwise, he'd have been eliminated by the Element Spirit Civilization," Another creature chimed in.</p>

  <p>"The target has been marked!"</p>

  <p>"The other races will also receive notice of this task."</p>

  <p>"We have to do something before others decide to..."</p>

  <p>The group of monsters were boiling over with excitement.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the same occurrence was happening among the other races all over the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Warriors had already left marks on the backs of the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi. This group of humans would be like beacons in the dark to the monsters hunting them from every direction.</p>

  <p>The sharp sound of something flying through the air echoed all around.</p>

  <p>Zheng was zipping through the air at incredible speeds, maintaining the height of ten feet from the ground.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Goddess's guidance was right, they should be able to find the entrance by heading north and then west.</p>

  <p>There were many different entrances from the Grand Pure Realm to the Supreme Pure Realm. Each one was well designed and full of unknown dangers.</p>

  <p>Nearly every non-human creature and Eternal Realm warrior who could enter the Supreme Pure Realm had their own unique methods.</p>

  <p>"Those two brats are incredibly annoying!" King Ieuan grumbled as it turned around to look at the two Shadow Warriors flying through the sky.</p>

  <p>They were keeping speed with Zheng no matter how much faster he attempted to go. It seemed an impossible task to lose them.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Look out!"</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog beside Fuxi suddenly roared and warned, "There's something coming up ahead, very dangerous!"</p>

  <p>He could sense danger with his intuition, although he couldn't tell exactly what kind of danger it was.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted, trying to see what was ahead of them. An instant later, a long, thin, green arrow shot towards him.</p>

  <p>The arrow was coming at him swiftly like a bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng was always well prepared. With a slight tilt of his body, the arrow narrowly brushed past him.</p>

  <p>"More are coming!" The Augury Dog observed.</p>

  <p>They whistled through the air as they cut a straight path for them.</p>

  <p>More arrows appeared ahead of them, twinkling in the sky like deadly green stars. Simultaneously they all were released and shot towards Zheng. They were clumped together in irregular patterns, like a shower of flowers scattered by a fairy.</p>

  <p>"Who's firing the arrows?! I can't see anyone." Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It must be the Arrow Demons!" King Ieuan answered. "They use unique arrows that can span across incredibly long distances. Normally, they must aim for the target by eyesight, but since our positions were marked by the Shadow Warriors, they only need to shoot in the direction of the marks."</p>

  <p>Zheng realized King Ieuan was right. The arrows weren't coming directly for him, they were heading for the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi on his back. The Arrow Demons couldn't actually see them.</p>

  <p>The arrows continued to whistle through the air non-stop. When they were struck, they were destroyed with a loud crack.</p>

  <p>Zheng was avoiding as many of the arrows as he could, but when he couldn't evade them, he would swing his arm and easily deflect them to the ground.</p>

  <p>The arrows seemed to have a mind of their own though. Whenever they would hit the ground, they'd ricochet off and continue their path to the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>It left Zheng with no other choice but to reach out and snatch arrows to snap them.</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew the arrows were coming for them, so they were using their theurgies to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had wrapped herself in a thick crimson shadow, while Eastern Emperor Taiyi had summoned his golden sword to circle around him.</p>

  <p>The sword wouldn't move swiftly until an arrow came too close, then it would snap out and cut the arrow in half.</p>

  <p>Despite the mass amount of arrows being rained down on them, very few actually made it near the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued his flight, remaining low to the ground. In the face of all the sharp obstacles racing towards him, his speed did not falter.</p>
