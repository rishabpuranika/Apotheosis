<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 90 Rescued (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>By the rules set forth for the Cloud Sect disciples, they received one point for twenty blade locusts. Such a pile of blade locust corpses was a vast number of points in the disciples' eyes!</p>

  <p>However, the bodies of blade locust were too big to drag, so the Cloud Sect stipulated that it was necessary to dig the crystal core from the chest of blade locust.</p>

  <p>Since everyone had fought hard for such a long time, they were eager to get some booty.</p>

  <p>But, Martin was pushing them to leave, of course, all of the disciples were upset.</p>

  <p>The fact that the relationship between the imperial army and the Cloud Sect wasn't a harmonious one didn't help. They didn't like each other, and incidents of group brawls erupted at times for no reason.</p>

  <p>Someone said to Martin, "Can you wait for just a little while? We need to..."</p>

  <p>Martin interrupted, "Hmmph! I know what you want to do, but, you'd better think it over prudently! We've detected legions of blade locusts swarming here, and our lives are worth more than yours! You don't have to go if you don't want to. But, we are leaving!"</p>

  <p>Feeling they had no choice, the Cloud Sect disciples prepared to set out with the troops.</p>

  <p>They had to follow the imperial army.</p>

  <p>With so many blade locusts corpses, several cultivators of the nature level decided to stay and collect some crystal cores. They thought they'd be able to break through the encirclement alone, but, looking up they saw the increasing amounts of blade locusts, and finally, gave up the idea.</p>

  <p>The average strength of a single soldier in the imperial army was weaker than an individual disciple of the Cloud Sect, but, they had a few tricks coping with the large numbers of blade locusts.</p>

  <p>For example, the bamboos they carried were designed in particular for fending off the blade locust attacks.</p>

  <p>Trudging ahead, they lit a stick of bamboo every ten feet or so. As long as the bamboo released a cloud of smoke, the blade locusts were held off, hovering out of reach above their heads.</p>

  <p>The imperial army silently marched, leading the way, while the disciples of Cloud Sect plodding along behind, had to counterattack blade locusts from time to time, with either swords or bows.</p>

  <p>However, overall the blade locusts almost all kept their distance and were difficult to hit, so whenever a disciple hit one or two blade locust, they would laugh elatedly.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene, Luo Zheng just shook his head.</p>

  <p>The strength of a single Cloud Sect disciple was greater than an individual soldier of the imperial army.</p>

  <p>Still, if they were to fight against each other, the Cloud Sect disciples might very well be defeated.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect disciples didn't have the training that the military had, so they didn't acquire the benefits of teamwork.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, they had trekked through the jungle. Under the leadership of the imperial army, they had crossed a small river and hiked to the top of a hill, where a magnificent castle came into view.</p>

  <p>"It's the Dragon Fort. We are safe here!" shouted a few sharp-eyed inner disciples when they spotted the castle.</p>

  <p>It was the Dragon Fort, their destination, and was used to defend the southern frontier of the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Fort was deemed the most critical barrier in the southern part of the Burning Sky Empire, and beyond it was the endless tropical rain forest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once read the book "Exotic Beasts Annals," which recorded the areas of adventuring throughout the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>In the book, it recorded a story of cultivators from the Eastern Region going deep into the rain forest. One hundred miles deep in the lush rain forest, they had only found level three beasts, and it was reasonably safe.</p>

  <p>Another five hundred miles further into the forest though one would encounter creatures that were level five. Over a thousand miles deep into the rain forest, all kinds of level seven or eight senior beasts could be found.</p>

  <p>Further within the rain forest was a world too difficult for humans to explore.</p>

  <p>Every year, tons of beasts emerged from the rain forest to attack the Burning Sky Empire for unknown reasons.</p>

  <p>It was the Dragon Fort's role to keep these beasts from the rain forest at bay.</p>

  <p>Among the various beasts, the most troublesome was the blade locust.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Fort was rudimentary in appearance, boasting no ornament for either the walls or the moat except for one huge sculpted dragon head hanging on the wall.</p>

  <p>The sculpture was entirely black, and the dragon's eyes sparkled when they caught the light. The sculpture radiated incomparable majesty.</p>

  <p>While passing under the dragon head sculpture, each disciple of the Cloud Sect felt a sense of awe.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng walked closer, he stood, staring up at the dragon's eyes for a while with a hint of doubt rising in his heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel the 'intention' from within dragon head sculpture, the spiritual pressure it was emitting.</p>
