  <p>
</p>

  <p>These elites all came from rich clans and were particularly proud of their good conscience. They would never neglect to pay a debt of gratitude.</p>

  <p>However, they were currently caught in an extremely precarious situation. Rushing out now would mean immediate death and their conscience wasn't enough for them to risk their lives.</p>

  <p>"Jolyon... Do you have any more puppets?" a True God asked.</p>

  <p>Jolyon had successfully lured a batch of Time Ghosts away with his puppets earlier. Unfortunately, that led to all of them getting cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Yes but I don't think they'll be really useful," Jolyon said.</p>

  <p>He did have several powerful puppets, even a special one that was even stronger than himself.</p>

  <p>"These Time Ghosts are blocking the door. Puppets will be useless against them," Pascal pointed out.</p>

  <p>Jolyon nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Sending out the puppets would only result in them getting surrounded by the Time Ghosts. They would only end up getting cut up and destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>Reginald was still in the air with a bunch of Time Ghosts hot at his tail.</p>

  <p>His life was currently on the line as he would be dead meat the moment his pursuer caught up with him.</p>

  <p>The sight of Reginald literally running for his life gave the other True Gods bad anxiety.</p>

  <p>Even Woodruff, who was outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land, frowned deeply when he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>The War God Hall did not have many True Gods but each one of them was extremely talented and powerful. Reginald was one of Woodruff's own disciples and the master was certain his student could become a consummate True God in the future. He wouldn't want to see that go to waste if Reginald ended up dying here in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p id="top_24">It was at this time that Luo Zheng walked towards the door of the Divine Time Temple. As he approached, the Time Ghosts grew restless.</p>

  <p>Liusu gritted her teeth in concern. She wanted to stop him but ended up not saying anything.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing! Don't get too close to them," Kelsey warned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was only two or three inches away from the Time Ghosts. "These Time Ghosts' attacks are simple. All they do is channel the power of the time cracks, surround their targets, and cut them into pieces..." he muttered.</p>

  <p>"The problem is that no one can resist the cutting power of the time cracks," Pascal pointed out.</p>

  <p>The young man smiled. "There's no need to block the cutting power.</p>

  <p>There are things that can't be cut into pieces."</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods present stared at Luo Zheng in confusion. Even Nelly couldn't help but speak, "What kind of thing can't be cut into pieces?"</p>

  <p>"Water, or any sort of liquid," Luo Zheng said simply.</p>

  <p>He tapped his space ring and a golden light appeared in front of him: the Golden Beast Statue.</p>

  <p>Surprise was written all over everyone's faces when they saw the Golden Beast Statue in front of them. This was one of the highest prizes the Han Clan offered for the Arena of Legends. Liusu herself wanted to win this statue. It was originally placed in the Holy Emperor City but disappeared so suddenly. Nobody expected it would be in Luo Zheng's possession.</p>

  <p>Those who knew of the statue immediately understood what Luo Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>Jolyon's puppets were powerful and complicated but they would all be completely destroyed by the Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue was different. It was essentially a mass of mobile liquid that could transform into various shapes much like the Heavenly Body.</p>

  <p>Liusu and a few other members of the Han Clan knew about this but there were some other True Gods who were still puzzled at what Luo Zheng intended to do.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng used this Golden Beast Statue as a temporary body for Master Evil. After taking out the statue, Luo Zheng asked Master Evil to leave for a moment and he obliged, quietly returning to the young man's mind.</p>

  <p>Now fully under his control, the Golden Beast Statue suddenly pounced!</p>

  <p>It was immediately seized by one of the Time Ghosts. Luo Zheng lost the connection with the Golden Beast Statue and could only watch it get cut open by the power of the time cracks.</p>

  <p>A horrible, metal screech was heard as the statue was cut into pieces by the Time Ghost.</p>

  <p>Pieces of gold eventually fell from the sky and made tiny, tinkling sounds as they hit the ground.</p>

  <p>A look of disappointment appeared on everyone's faces. What was Luo Zheng thinking bringing out such a thing?</p>

  <p>"Humph, this thing is just rubbish. What's the use of it?" Langston mocked, not noticing the look of disdain Liusu shot him.</p>

  <p>A short while later, however, the gold pieces seemed to soften and liquefy, merging together and once again reforming into the Golden Beast Statue. As soon as it was whole again, it immediately pounced and ran outside.</p>

  <p>It was too close. The Golden Beast Statue had only crossed the distance of around ten feet and could hardly increase its speed when the Time Ghosts at the door rushed over. In the blink of an eye, it was caught by a Time Ghost and then was chopped into pieces all over again.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the True Gods' hearts were all ablaze with hope.</p>

  <p>They finally understood what the statue was for. Although the Golden Beast Statue was very rare, there were many magic weapons of similar kind. It was perfect to use it in such an occasion!</p>

  <p>As soon as it cut the Golden Beast Statue in pieces, the Time Ghost returned to its post at the door of the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the statue quietly recombined together.</p>

  <p>There was a bit of distance between where the statue reformed and where the Time Ghosts stood guard. This distance gave the Golden Beast Statue the chance to fully pounce and run at full speed.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As it ran, the Golden Beast Statue turned into a beam of light and flew, attracting the attention of the Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>There was a piercing humming sound as the Time Ghosts, who were previously devoted at guarding the door, all flew out to chase after the Golden Beast Statue.</p>

  <p>"Now! Hurry!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted with urgency towards Reginald who was up in the sky.</p>

  <p>Reginald was almost at his limit. He persisted almost on willpower alone and had little to no energy to even notice what was happening around him.</p>

  <p>Even when the Time Ghosts left, he remained in a state of numbness and distress.</p>

  <p>Somehow, Luo Zheng's voice pierced through the haze in Reginald's mind. It was like a battle cry that immediately lifted his spirit and he found himself suddenly rushing into the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Reginald did not cross the last section of the path to the Divine Time Temple by flying. Instead, he smashed directly into the temple.</p>

  <p>As he rushed through the gate, Luo Zheng quickly reached out and caught him, letting him spin in his hands to slow down before fully letting go.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Golden Beast Statue had once again been cut into pieces and the Time Ghosts were all on their way back to their posts.</p>

  <p>With a heavy gasp, Reginald felt his legs wobble and he quickly sat down. "Thank you!" he said in a breathless voice.</p>

  <p>Warriors of the War God Hall always had a fiery temper but good morals. Having escaped death, Reginald couldn't thank Luo Zheng enough. He was truly grateful from the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome. I just did what I had to do. Besides, you got yourself in such a dangerous situation because you wanted to save everyone," Luo Zheng replied. Reginald could've definitely run away by relying on his own strength but he chose to lure the Time Ghosts instead. Not everyone had the courage to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then looked at the Golden Beast Statue in the distance. He didn't know if the Divine Time Temple had any other points of exit or entry. If it only had this one door, then he would still need to use the Golden Beast Statue when they left later.</p>

  <p>Woodruff witnessed all this outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>"Good, good, good! Which clan is that boy from? He looks very promising! If he ever finds himself in our War God Hall in the future, I shall definitely reward him!"</p>

  <p>"This little guy sure does have some abilities but there's also some luck at play here. I was afraid Reginald was about to die at some point," another Holy Being said.</p>

  <p>Was it through skill or merely sheer luck that this boy managed to successfully save Reginald?</p>

  <p>A faint smile made its way on Joy's face. Worry lingered in her heart despite Luo Zheng's heroic bravery. The more people paid attention to him, the more trouble he could potentially be in. She only hoped for the young man's safety and that he would safely leave the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Once the Astronomical Transit Day ended, she also hoped for his uneventful departure from the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>
