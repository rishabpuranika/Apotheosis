  <p>He could be resurrected if he lost his life, but if Luo Luo Zheng took his Illusion Points, then what he would face was probably the young master's harsh punishment!</p>

  <p>For this reason, the moment Norton was sent flying backward, a golden pill abruptly appeared in his hand!</p>

  <p>But before his palm could touch the golden pill, he heard a sneer!</p>

  <p>With his quick-thinking, coupled with his agile movement, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to get close to Norton. He had anticipated that Norton would put the golden pill in to use. But Norton's sudden attempt to smash it turned futile as a sudden streak of blue light flashed!</p>

  <p>Shock engulfed him as Norton felt a numbing dull ache at his right hand!</p>

  <p>His hand had been cut off in an instant by Luo Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword as Luo Luo Zheng flew high into the air with the golden pill in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's movements were neat and swift. His body flashed as he snatched the golden pill out of Norton's severed hand. Then with a tumble, his knee was pressed against Norton's chest, while he aimed the edge of his sword at him.</p>

  <p>"My young master won't..."</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't let Norton finish his words. If they stayed somewhere else, he would have listened to what he was about to say.</p>

  <p>This city was mysteriously strange in an odd way. And he was kind of afraid that the Illusion Points would suddenly fly away. Thus he thought he should kill Norton first. He just intended to get Norton's Illusion Points, not wanting them to take off in the air.</p>

  <p>Until now, Luo Luo Zheng still couldn't fathom why the Illusion Points would automatically fly out after the warrior in the blue clothes died.</p>

  <p>And as soon as Norton died, before he was brought back to the city to revive, he was slowly wrapped up by a red light dot, while at the same time, a large number of Illusion Points exploded. As expected of him, Norton had much more Illusion Points than the warrior in the blue clothes.</p>

  <p>A crowd of yellow dots of light burst out from Norton's body and flew towards Luo Luo Zheng. Witnessing all this, Luo Luo Zheng let out a sigh of relief. He thought that there was someone who could influence the rules of the Illusion Battlefield! It seemed he was wrong now.</p>

  <p>Back on the city walls, after the warriors had keenly observed the whole scene, most of them were filled with envy and pity.</p>

  <p>They envied Luo Luo Zheng because he possessed such strength. Not only did he succeed in resisting Norton, but he even killed him in one blow and obtained so many Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>The reason they felt pity for Luo Luo Zheng was that they knew very well what kind of miserable thing would happen to him after this.</p>

  <p>In the past, when the city lord was attempting to take control of the city, series of revolts from many warriors had happened. Some of them were more powerful than Norton and the others, while some had even killed Norton a few times.</p>

  <p>But in the end, they were slaughtered time and time again by the city lord! No one would be able to escape her wrath!</p>

  <p>Now, not only did those warriors have few Illusion Points, but leaving the main city was seriously tough and tricky for them!</p>

  <p>If they happened to succeed in getting out of the city alive, they would be hunted down by the city lord and her subordinates without recourse!</p>

  <p>This city lord had a superb ability to move at an insanely high speed.</p>

  <p>Thus, no Soul Sea Realm warrior could get rid of her without that much difficulty.</p>

  <p>From the way they looked and weighed this, Luo Zheng's life would have a grim ending!</p>

  <p>"After Norton dies, the city lord would come over!"</p>

  <p>"This guy doesn't leave yet. If he runs away now, he would be able to escape the city lord's attack!"</p>

  <p>"This warrior must be a warrior who came from another city and is not aware of the city lord's strength!"</p>

  <p>What they all didn't know was that Luo Luo Zheng had no plan of leaving this place at all. He was targeting the infamous city lord.</p>

  <p>Those several subordinates of this city lord had already got a lot of Illusion Points, so to speak, the number of Illusion Points accumulated by this city lord might be significantly huge! Thinking about this, how could Luo Luo Zheng possibly be willing to leave?</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had killed two of her men, the city lord, who was so overbearing, would probably come to attack him very soon. And this was all Luo Luo Zheng wanted.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still outside the city. His gaze focused solely on the golden pill in his hand.</p>

  <p>This golden pill was most likely a supreme treasure, since its power was so terrifying. Fortunately, this was good for one-time use! Still, if a warrior released the golden pill in the face of an enemy, it would have a miraculous effect!</p>

  <p>But this golden pill needed to be crushed before it could be activated.</p>

  <p>Could it be that this golden pill could only be used to commit suicide?</p>

  <p>While he was keen at observing the golden pellet, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt that it was heating up. He could tell that there was a formidable power surging within. Sensing that it would explode, he almost reflexively tossed the golden pellet far away!</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>After the golden pellet hovered over one hundred feet in the air, a dense mass of blood-red lightning was emitted from it!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned by encountering this scene. If it weren't for his quick reaction, he probably would've been caught up in the lightning as well!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a chill coming from behind him. When he turned his head, he saw a woman. She was dressed in purple clothes, and slowly making her way towards him, with snow falling silently and trailing behind her.</p>
