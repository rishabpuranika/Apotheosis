  <p>
</p>

  <p>Forming a special array, the three members of the Han Clan went into formation, with Liusu in front, and Pascal and Aleyna standing on each of her sides.</p>

  <p>All three of them moved exceptionally fast, approaching Luo Zheng quickly when he was stopped by the Nine-head Snake.</p>

  <p>When he was still in the Reincarnation Land, Luo Zheng learned about Samuel's secret and that the Memory Flames of these three had been erased. Looking them now, he knew that they were not the same people he had known about.</p>

  <p>Glancing at them, Luo Zheng had no intention to stop.</p>

  <p>Now his enemies were only these three people from the Han Clan. If he hesitated a little longer, he would end up battling with not just the consummate True Gods, but also the Demi-holy and Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Though he wanted to help them to regain their original memories, he realized that now was not the right time to do that.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smoothly evaded the nine huge heads of the snake like a feather and then escaped far away. Seeing him flee like a thief angered the Nine-head Snake.</p>

  <p>And since it couldn't catch up with Luo Zheng's speed, it decided to release its anger on the approaching members of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Roar! The huge creature let out an angry cry.</p>

  <p>Facing the direction where Liusu and the two others were fast approaching, the creature opened the mouths of all of its nine heads at the same time, spitting out some blood balls.</p>

  <p>Leading the way, Liusu's eyes flashed with a purple light, while a softer purple light suddenly flashed in the magic array they formed.</p>

  <p>Aleyna's and Pascal's internal momentum was thoroughly gathered by this magic array, merging with Liusu's.</p>

  <p>"Purple fire sword!"</p>

  <p>It was a magical joint-attack array which Samuel himself created.</p>

  <p>After connecting their minds together and cooperating with the magic array, they found that their joined strength increased several times!</p>

  <p>Seeing the blood balls spewed out by the Nine-head Snake flying towards them, Liusu formed a purple fire sword in her hand and waved it gently.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Held in her hands, the sword quickly split into dozens of smaller swords floating in the air.</p>

  <p>These smaller swords flew in all directions. Some swords penetrated the blood balls and burned them to ashes, while most of them directly attacked the Nine-head Snake.</p>

  <p>With its huge body, the monster moved very slowly and was unable to dodge.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, the small swords that Liusu released penetrated its entire body.</p>

  <p>While each small sword was only palm-sized, the head of the Nine-head Snake was over a thousand feet long and dozens of feet wide. Looking with naked eyes, the small blades didn't appear to cause any injuries to its huge body.</p>

  <p>Staring at the monster, Liusu's eyes flashed a purple light again and ordered in a low voice, "Explode now!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>All the swords stuck on the monster's body blew up at the same time, and blazing purple flames instantly spread from the necks of the nine huge heads.</p>

  <p>It howled in pain, twisted and fell into the sea of lava right below it.</p>

  <p>The ferocious purple flames kept burning violently even after they were mixed in the lava.</p>

  <p>Everything went so fast. The next second, the Nine-head Snake was burnt to ashes, leaving only a trace of purple fire spread on the surface of the sea of lava.</p>

  <p>'Looks like Liusu's purple flame has become more powerful after she reached consummation of the True God Realm!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself. He looked back to observe the situation behind him as he rapidly fled away.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the Nine-head Snake was not a very powerful creature, Luo Zheng could easily defeat it. However, in order to escape, he chose not to kill it.</p>

  <p>Instead, he left it behind to stop the three members of the Han Clan who were after him.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Liusu killed it easily.</p>

  <p>"Get him!"</p>

  <p>Liusu ordered indifferently, making a light flash in the middle of the magic array they formed. Increasing their speed to the extreme, they continued to chase on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as the three members of Han Clan left, several people following them arrived at this place.</p>

  <p>They were Rachelle, Troy and Shahn.</p>

  <p>After their last crushing defeat, they realized the fact that they were no match for Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't bear to see Luo Zheng run away just like that, knowing that the Demi-holy Beings of their clans would soon come to support them.</p>

  <p>"Liusu has just reached consummation of the True God Realm. How did she become so powerful?" Staring at the burning purple fire on the lava, Rachelle commented with astonishment, realizing that was the place where the Nine-head Snake had been killed.</p>

  <p>"Those three is quite a strange bunch. They all changed a lot both in temperament and strength," said Troy with a serious expression.</p>

  <p>Just then, three more figures flew towards them from behind. It turned out to be the three Demi-holy Beings: Jayden, Mathew and Raymond.</p>

  <p>They came a little late, as they were sent here by Nicholas himself. But now they had caught up with the rest!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to run, with several other groups of people chasing after him above the sea of lava.</p>

  <p>The hot air continued to rise from the sea of lava and blow on his face.</p>

  <p>Although he looked calm on the surface, he started to feel a little anxious.</p>

  <p>Without the guidance of the strange fish, he felt lost and uneasy. If he strayed into the lairs of some powerful creatures, he would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>He also couldn't get rid of the people chasing after him.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Han Clan followed very closely behind. There were several more powerful warriors a little behind them. Luo Zheng estimated that there were Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was thinking about an escape plan, the seemingly endless sea of lava suddenly came to an end. He slowed down, seeing the black coastline in front of him.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng felt a bit strange seeing the black coastline.</p>

  <p>It was not until he got a little closer that he realized it was not a coastline, but the edge of a black water area.</p>

  <p>The black 'coastline' appeared to be a dividing line between the two areas of liquid. On one side was the hot lava while the dark black water was on the other.</p>

  <p>The boundary between them was very clear. One never interfered with the other.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this place?" Luo Zheng muttered, taking his time to look around.</p>

  <p>He obviously found the vast black water ahead very weird.</p>

  <p>Not seeing anything moving from where he stood, it seemed to be a death land.</p>

  <p>If he had run into this kind of place another time and it wasn't necessary for him to enter, Luo Zheng would have chosen to take a detour.</p>

  <p>But now, he was left with no choice.</p>

  <p>As he hesitated for a little while, he could already hear a sharp whistling sound coming from behind him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A spiraling purple fire sword came straight for Luo Zheng. It was Liusu, launching an attack across a distance of tens of thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled in the air, easily dodging the fire sword. Spreading the lightning wings, he then entered the black water area ahead.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the three members of the Han Clan continued to chase after him.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Jayden, Mathew, Raymond, Rachelle and the rest arrived. Their faces became serious when they saw the black space.</p>

  <p>"What is this damned place? The water is so black, and I can see no signs of life," Jayden said with a frown.</p>

  <p>After all, they were in the Abyss Demon Region. The forbidden land had a lot of dangerous places. Even if they had a high level of cultivation base, they still had to be very careful most of the time.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," Rachelle said, thinking about how far Luo Zheng would've been now. "We shouldn't let that brat escape from us."</p>

  <p>"If you enter this place carelessly, you might end up dead sooner." After thinking for a while, Mathew added, "Rachel, why don't you guys go back first? We'll take care of the matter and chase after Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Demi-holy Beings, Rachelle and the other young warriors had the opportunity to inherit the Abyss Demon Region. It would be a pity if they lost their lives here.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they strongly believed that the three of them were enough to deal with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After coming up with a decision, the three Demi-holy Beings rushed into the black water area leaving the rest behind.</p>
