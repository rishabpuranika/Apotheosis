<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1240 Wipe Out The Ogres </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two powerful masters of the Spirit Supreme Realm looked calm. It made the ogres tense. They felt as if they were trapped under a heavy mountain.</p>

  <p>"Stop chatting, let's get down to business!" Dorothea's words made Woody grumpy. He hastily ended the subject at hand, his gaze falling on the tall and sturdy ogres. Casually waving the Black Nether Saber, he said, "Fortunately, the race we need to wipe out are the ogres. I find I don't have a very good opinion of them...."</p>

  <p>Dorothea smiled. "What a coincidence! I don't have a good opinion of them either."</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, the ogre race was not considered to be weak, but they were too aggressive and overbearing.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position had always taken a neutral stance in the Upper World. Their goals were vastly different from those of the other races.</p>

  <p>Human race, Demon Night, ogre race, and the other races all had similar aims of expanding their own races as the core, but the Celestial Position was formed by the talents of countless other races. They represented a unique group in the universe, their goals rather different from those of other ordinary races.</p>

  <p>Because the Celestial Position was neutral and strong, they shared a good relationship with most of the other races. For instance, they were on good terms with the humans, Demon Night and some other powerful groups in the universe.</p>

  <p>However, Celestial Position had a bone of contention with the ogre race.</p>

  <p>The ogres had a strong sense of loyalty toward their own race. They did not allow any ogre talents to join Celestial Position. If they found out that someone had betrayed them, they would banish them as traitors and hunt them down to the ends of the world.</p>

  <p>The ogres were also obstinate and fierce. They had fought Celestial Position several times. Sometimes, a few Supreme Lords had gotten involved.</p>

  <p>Thus, the ogres were not on friendly terms with the members of Celestial Position. Now that several Celestial Position warriors had come down to the Lower World and encountered these ogres, how could they possibly let them go unharmed?</p>

  <p>They were rather pressed for time. Even it was not for Zheng's sake, they would still take this opportunity to destroy the sacred places of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>Hearing Dorothea and Woody, Lamar got anxious. Even though he couldn't figure out where the masters had come from, he would not subject his Flaming Ogre Sacred Place to destruction!</p>

  <p>"Tw-two respected masters! May I have a word with you?" Lamar asked, his coarse voice trembling.</p>

  <p>"Hmm? What is it?" Woody looked at Lamar indifferently.</p>

  <p>"This matter is with regards to a grudge between the two sacred places of our ogre race and the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place," Lamar said. "I'm afraid it is unsuitable for you two masters to interfere like this."</p>

  <p>Woody only smiled. Of course, he knew that the Soul Sea Realm masters of the ogre race were on their last legs. "Unsuitable? Why?"</p>

  <p>"The disputes between the two races should be resolved by the two sides involved. Masters, please show us some mercy..." Lamar knew that the excuse he made up was untenable. In the world of warriors, strength determined everything. If a powerful master wanted to kill someone, he would find one hundred reasons and more to justify it. However, in this situation, Lamar could only brace himself and make excuses in the hopes that the two masters would let them go.</p>

  <p>Lacey and Chantel were nervous too. The situation was obvious. The two Spirit Supreme Realm masters before them were to decide the fate of the battle. However, they weren't certain that the two masters would be on Zheng's side. What if Lamar managed to convince them?</p>

  <p>"If you are kind enough not to intervene in this matter, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place would offer up all our treasures. We will bow down before you," Lamar continued.</p>

  <p>"Enough." Woody yawned and raised the Black Nether Saber in his hand, giving Lamar a wicked smile. "I have no interest in treasures belonging to some small sacred places. I am rather more interested in slaughtering ogres!"</p>

  <p>"Save your words! Let's start." Dorothea smiled faintly, the flower in her eye starting to spin.</p>

  <p>Lamar, Santino, and Omari realized that begging was useless. The expressions on their faces changed. The forceful energy within their bodies exploded and in an instant they flew off in three separate directions.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to sit still and await death. Knowing that they were unable to fight these powerful masters, the three of them chose to escape simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"They want to escape?" Woody's face looked fierce. His body suddenly turned into a black shadow. Circling the air quickly, it flashed and disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>The next moment, the crowd saw the black shadow fly toward Santino.</p>

  <p>They didn't see how Woody was attacking. They only witnessed a flash of black light that hit Santino's mountain-like body, making it spout blood mist. He quickly fell to the ground with a thud.</p>

  <p>After killing Santino, Woody turned into a streak of lightning and charged toward Omari...</p>

  <p>As for Dorothea, she let out a bell-like laughter and chased after Lamar.</p>

  <p>Compared to Woody's pretty good saber skills and fast speed, Dorothea was slow in her pace as she followed Lamar. Meanwhile, the flower in her eye began to emit a faint green light.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the green light, Lamar's speed gradually slowed down. Very soon, a terrified expression covered his face. He howled in a frenzy and waved the ghost staff, causing raging flames to engulf the empty space.</p>

  <p>Lamar kept roaring hysterically.</p>

  <p>As he waved the ghost staff frantically, blood arrows burst out from his chest and his heart exploded. The ogres all had enormous build and their hearts were more powerful than those of ordinary creatures. After his heart burst, the blood arrows flew several hundreds of feet away.</p>

  <p>Lamar's power began to rapidly weaken soon after. He fell down in no time, his eyes as wide as saucers. Even as he breathed his last, he was traumatized by the fear.</p>

  <p>"It's an illusion�" Lacey said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"It was fear that caused his heart to explode. That led to his death."</p>

  <p>Chantel nodded, feeling like Lamar's frightening death would long linger on her mind.</p>

  <p>The ogres were indeed tyrannical, but they were also brave. How terrifying was the illusion that it had scared him out of his wits and made his heart explode?</p>

  <p>Dorothea was still smiling, her hands behind her back. The flower in her right eye stopped spinning as she flew toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh�</p>

  <p>After killing Omari and Santino, Woody soon materialized beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"All right, we have finished off these three rats," he stated coldly. "It's time to ask your Demon Night friends to help us gather the materials."</p>

  <p>Now that the three mighty ogre warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had been killed off, the confidence level of the remaining ogres dropped to their feet. They began scattering in all directions.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of the Demon Night, they were enjoying a boosted morale. They began chasing and killing the fleeing ogres.</p>

  <p>Lacey and Chantel did not join the others in the killing. The outcome of this battle was a foregone conclusion, and the two of them clearly knew what to do next.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could even respond to Woody, Lacey respectfully bowed to him. "Master, the Demon Night will forever remember what you did today, but we do not know of the materials you require. We would certainly do our best to help."</p>

  <p>Woody chuckled. "Aha. They are not very special materials," he said courteously. "You should exterminate those little rats first."</p>

  <p>Seeing Woody's attitude, Luo Zheng felt suspicious. Woody was a hateful man and never had anything nice to say. Why was he being so polite to the Demon Night?</p>

  <p>His face reflected his confusion. Dorothea, who stood beside him, chuckled and stated to him in a low voice, "The woman he fell in love with is from the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>Comprehension dawned on Luo Zheng. Now he knew why Woody was acting so strangely. The Celestial Position consisted of talents from different races. It was not unusual for Demon Night members to be a part of the Celestial Position. Indeed, Woody loved a girl from the Demon Night, so he was courteous to the members of the race. No wonder he had just gone all out to kill the ogres.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Chantel spoke up, her face full of worry, "Lacey, I don't know how everything is going with Amber. If the Dread Ogre Sacred Place really went after her, I'm afraid she might be in danger..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed as he shuffled through the memories of the great world. He soon released a sigh of relief, saying with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Amber is fine. She is currently on her way back."</p>

  <p>He then lifted his head and looked into the distance. A few minutes later, a ray of light in the sky shot toward the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>
