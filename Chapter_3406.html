<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3406 One Last Chance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone directed their gazes to the upper part of the cave. Two eyes-- the Dreaded Eye Demons flickered with red light.</p>

  <p>They lingered for a long while before disappearing.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Is that the Malicious Stare?"</p>

  <p>"How could it be so powerful?"</p>

  <p>The other races that entered the cave later hadn't experienced the soul-crushing fear. When they saw what happened to the two members of the Separate Abyss race, they were all shocked.</p>

  <p>"Those are sculptures of the Dreaded Eye Demons!"</p>

  <p>"The Malicious Stare is way too powerful. Is there a strong Dreaded Eye Demon in the main peak?"</p>

  <p>"Then how can we climb the mountain?"</p>

  <p>These people were experienced and knowledgeable. They not only recognized the sculptures on the walls, but also guessed that the main peak was guarded by a Dreaded Eye Demon.</p>

  <p>At a loss for what to do, everyone turned to the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Although the Icy Snow Province was open to the public, it was still under the control of the Pear Hill. The other super forces might not know what had happened in the Chaotic Source World, but the people of the Pear Hill must know something.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the Chaotic Source World?"</p>

  <p>"You should have let us know!"</p>

  <p>"Please tell us!"</p>

  <p>"If you keep silent, don't blame us for being rude!"</p>

  <p>They had been in the Chaotic Source World for such a long time and explored the periphery and the four peaks, but couldn't find many Chaotic Source Spirits. Naturally, they were angry.</p>

  <p>Questioned by so many members of the myriad races, the people of the Pear Hill were under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong they were, they couldn't afford to anger that many people.</p>

  <p>At this time, Yan walked out at a casual pace and swept her gaze across the faces of those assembling there. "The Chaotic Source Sea and the Chaotic Source Spirits are already out of control," she said.</p>

  <p>Hearing Yan's words, many of the other races had surprise written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>Some didn't understand what Yan was talking about, while some let thoughts flash across their minds.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>"This is the last time the Chaotic Source World opens and the only chance for us to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. If we miss it, we won't get a second chance," Yan replied faintly.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"How could that happen?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! The Chaotic Source World has existed for eons. How could this be our last chance?"</p>

  <p>The members of the other races were all shocked.</p>

  <p>To them, it didn't matter if they couldn't merge with the Chaotic Source Spirits this time. The tickets to the Chaotic Source World were precious to ordinary people, but to these elites of the major races, they were nothing.</p>

  <p>If they failed this time, they'd try again. Where there was life, there was hope. In any case, life came first.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was also filled with surprise. He asked Yan, "The Chaotic Source Spirits constantly reproduce, don't they?"</p>

  <p>Yan blinked her eyes and nodded. "Yes, but since they're from the Other Shore, their bodies are left there."</p>

  <p>In the past, the Chaotic Source Spirits were strictly controlled on the Other Shore, and the place where they were controlled was the Chaotic Source Sea.</p>

  <p>Even if all the two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were killed, the Chaotic Source World would be prosperous again, as long as the strong warriors went to the Chaotic Source Sea and chose several other Chaotic Source Spirits as parents.</p>

  <p>But now, after the Chaotic Source Sea on the Other Shore had been occupied, there were no more parents.</p>

  <p>Once a Chaotic Source Spirit was merged, there was one less existing in the Source World.</p>

  <p>After hearing Yan's words, many of the races were excited. They had one last chance to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the main peak? Why are there sculptures of the Dreaded Eye Demons here?" asked a member of the Celestial Wolf race.</p>

  <p>Yan shook her head and said, "I don't know either. Put simply, if you want to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, you have to go all-out."</p>

  <p>Mount, Mya and the talented disciples of the various races wouldn't miss this chance. If they did miss that chance, it would be worse than death. That meant they'd never reach the Chaotic Source Realm, no matter how long they lived.</p>

  <p>Yan's words sobered them up, and spurred a veritable brainstorm. They came up with many ideas.</p>

  <p>Originally, everyone was on edge, each race not trusting the others. But now, they were in a better mood. They were focused on a common goal.</p>

  <p>At this time, another figure appeared at an entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>As soon as it appeared, an invisible malicious aura spread out like a giant beast baring its teeth and claws.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked over and found the young man in black standing at the cave entrance. Their faces sank.</p>

  <p>"Evil God! How dare you show up here?"</p>

  <p>A man in golden armor from the Separate Abyss race took two steps forward, one golden hammer in each hand, and his face was full of anger.</p>

  <p>His clansmen also stepped forward and formed a half moon shape, presenting a united front against the Evil God.</p>

  <p>They had never suffered such an egregious loss before.</p>

  <p>Nearly a third of their clansmen were slain by a young man. This was an affront that demanded blood for blood.</p>

  <p>When the other races saw the Evil God, they also looked at him with hatred in their eyes.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God entered the Chaotic Source World, he had already provoked many races by killing their clansmen for no reason.</p>

  <p>He did the same on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even the super forces like the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race could not escape his hatred.</p>

  <p>Someone had said that he would tear the Evil God limb from limb if he found him in the Source World, but the Evil God's power was undiminished in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Now that the Evil God was outnumbered, the people assembling in the cave were not afraid of him.</p>

  <p>They were all elites of the major races. They didn't believe that the Evil God could resist all of them alone.</p>

  <p>There was an indifferent smile on the Evil God's face. The Ways-blending Energy gathered slowly in his right hand and coalesced into a diamond-shaped gem, which glinted evilly. Even facing so many strong warriors, he remained calm.</p>

  <p>Some of the creatures looking at him were very nervous. What was he playing at?</p>

  <p>Seeing the restless members of the Separate Abyss race about to rush forward, Khalid of the Bearing race reminded them, "Hamzah! If we fight here, we will risk activating the Malicious Stare!"</p>

  <p>Hamzah was one of the strongest of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't want to fight the Evil God, the Separate Abyss race had been humiliated. So he had to fight.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Hearing Khalid's words, Hamzah frowned.</p>

  <p>"We've already been through this." Khalid cupped his hands and told Hamzah what happened just now.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race were arrogant. They didn't hang out with the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>However, Khalid still hoped they could form an alliance with the Separate Abyss race. He warned them kindly because he wanted them on his side.</p>

  <p>After thinking it over, Hamzah stared ferociously at the Evil God and led his clansmen to the side.</p>

  <p>Everyone could see a fight between the Separate Abyss race and the Evil God was brewing.</p>
