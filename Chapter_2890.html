  <p>When Murphy planted the ancient sorcerer race in the Evolutionary Universe, his purpose was very clear.</p>

  <p>He wanted to control the will of the universe.</p>

  <p>However, Mike was the master of the Evolutionary Universe. As Luo Zheng's father, he had made plans to protect Luo Zheng against any danger, from his birth even unto the future.</p>

  <p>Thus, Murphy couldn't compete against Luo Zheng for the control over the will of the universe. Eventually, the Supreme Lords had won that battle.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, let's just kill that woman! We're going to fight to the death anyway," Hamish suddenly said after a short silence.</p>

  <p>Leyton squinted his eyes at him, a trace of cold light flashing quickly across his pupils. "I'm afraid this is the only path we can take. Let's go to the Sun Blind race!"</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since the divine land separated from the Source World. As such, without influence from the Nine Li race, it would be easy for it to have its own will.</p>

  <p>The divine land wasn't like a universe, but it was a well-developed place.</p>

  <p>Once its will was born, it would be impossible to suppress it.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards had realized this problem the moment they entered the divine land. But it was not until later that they found the means used by the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The waves of the Time Sea gently lapped against the shore.</p>

  <p>The time splinters in the seawater could tear apart everything in the sea, but it wouldn't tear apart its container.</p>

  <p>For countless years, the Sun Blind race had lived a leisurely and relaxed life.</p>

  <p>The life of their people was quite short. The oldest only lived for thousands of years, while some died as young as three-hundred years old.</p>

  <p>That was very short compared with True Gods, who had a limitless lifespan.</p>

  <p>The lifespan of the Sun Blind race could be compared to a wildflower that bloomed in the morning, only to die later in the night.</p>

  <p>However, people cherished things that were easily lost. They learned to cherish their life, short as it was.</p>

  <p>Enjoying a limitless lifespan, the True Gods never stopped to think about how many years they wasted on a single thing. They lived like slaves chasing what they wanted. A residence in the divine city or hundreds of divine might coins could easily take a few divine eras out of their life.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the members of the Sun Blind race cherished their current life more.</p>

  <p>If there were few disciples of the Floating Islands that needed to use their boats, the Sun Blind race would usually find a beach. There, they would lie comfortably and bask in the sun.</p>

  <p>In the woods, on the inner side of the island stood a wooden building. If someone walked into it, they would be able to hear the creaks that each step made on the wood.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch of the Sun Blind race sat on the wooden building's terrace. Her white dress looked pristine and radiant, while her eyes were dull and emotionless.</p>

  <p>Along the path to the woods, three tall and strong Sun Blind race members strode directly to the wooden building. When they saw the female patriarch, the leader of the group cupped his hands and said, "Patriarch! The Mountain of Holy Beings has appeared ahead of time, breaking the tradition. Do we...?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the female patriarch replied flatly, even before he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>There was an ancient legend within the Sun Blind race that their mission would eventually come to an end.</p>

  <p>That day would come along with the appearance of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race was very concerned about this matter, and naturally, they had to ask their female patriarch about it.</p>

  <p>"Have you chosen someone you think is ready? Is it  Luo Zheng Luo, who took the Time Jade Seal?" another man asked.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch smiled faintly, and a hint of gratification flashed in her eyes. "I asked you to guess, but you haven't seen it. Now, it seems that it is indeed him."</p>

  <p>"Then, what should we do?" the man asked again.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch shook her head and said, "I don't know either. You can choose to leave Time Sea to be an ordinary divine citizen or stay on the island."</p>

  <p>"We were born here, and we grew up here. I don't think any member would want to leave," the man answered.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch raised a finger lightly, tapped in the air, and a ray of bright light spread from it, forming a thin sword.</p>

  <p>It was the Time Sword of Gods.</p>

  <p>"Even the Holy Beings think that this sword could destroy everything, but time is too profound to control. Time has the mystery of chaos. I can't even kill Nicholas with this sword. If you stay here, I can't protect you." The female leader's voice sounded helpless as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Although our race doesn't have a long life, none of us is afraid of death!" the man declared passionately.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch didn't respond. Instead, she stood up and took two steps back lightly. With a flourish, she slashed at the place where she had been standing. She flicked the blade of the long sword with her finger. The aura of time quietly spread in the air.</p>

  <p>"Patriarch, why did you..." The man anxiously eyed the bright light in front of him.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch gave a bitter smile and said, "Don't worry, you will know soon."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a wave of space fluctuated suddenly on the terrace. It was followed by five figures that emerged from the light.</p>

  <p>The man who led the team was Leyton!</p>

  <p>He glanced at the female patriarch and asked flatly, "Are you the woman in charge of the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>The female patriarch nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"At that time, it was my order that stopped Nicholas and Hamish from killing you," said Leyton.</p>

  <p>A mischievous smile appeared on the female patriarch's face. "So, should I thank you?"</p>

  <p>With the Time Sword of Gods, the female patriarch could kill almost everything.</p>

  <p>However, the sword had its flaws. The warriors in the divine land would not be able to fight against her, but that didn't mean Yellow Emperor Guards could not. Hamish had even told Nicholas how to dodge the sword.</p>

  <p>That was why Nicholas had been able to subdue the female patriarch by himself.</p>

  <p>"If you hand over the method of controlling the original will, I will spare your life. One day, if I return to the Source World, the Yellow Emperor race will have a great reward for you!" Leyton added.</p>

  <p>"I survived that time not because you pitied me, but because you didn't dare to kill me. Would you dare to kill me now?" asked the female patriarch suddenly.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing I won't do now!" Leyton threatened in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>The patriarch held her head high. It was obvious that she wasn't frightened.</p>

  <p>She challenged him with a mocking smile. "Then do it!"</p>

  <p>"You!" Leyton's face darkened in anger. However, he hesitated to hurt her.</p>

  <p>He came here to force this woman to surrender. He was not planning to kill her, at all.</p>

  <p>"You think we won't kill you, bitch?"</p>

  <p>Zavier twitched behind him, about to make a move. However, Leyton stopped him. He ordered him angrily, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>"You won't make a move, so I have to move first."</p>

  <p>The female patriarch sighed as if she was getting bored. The moment she finished speaking, a powerful aura came from behind her.</p>

  <p>Leyton was stunned. "Damn it! Stop her!"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards responded quickly, but it was still too late.</p>

  <p>Before they could come near her, she had already brandished her sword.</p>

  <p>A bizarre, colorful sword radiance suddenly appeared behind her and tore her body apart. Even the Time Sword of Gods in her hand shattered at the same time, and it turned into colorful crystals.</p>
