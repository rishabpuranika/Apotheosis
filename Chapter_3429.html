<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The abacus's beads moved up and down for a while until they settled down and showed the number, one thousand and two hundred.</p>

  <p>When Mount saw it, he knew it meant he could only exert six hundred divine megatons of force in the next attack.</p>

  <p>Such an amount of force was no longer powerful enough to defeat the talents of the young generation.</p>

  <p>Most of these people who stayed in the core area could easily exert a thousand divine megatons of force. Some Other Shore Tokens of the descending type could even exert more than that amount of power.</p>

  <p>As Mount mulled this development over, Chaim, seriously injured, collapsed to the ground, blood gurgling out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>When the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace saw this, they all descended from the sky and surrounded him protectively.</p>

  <p>"Chaim, are you okay?" Sally walked to Chaim's side and helped him to stand up.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge took out a golden pill, pushed it into Chaim's mouth and pronounced with certainty, "He won't die."</p>

  <p>After swallowing the pill with great difficulty, Chaim glanced up at Mount in the sky. "You can attack him now. His strength has been greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>His next attack will have only six hundred divine megatons of force, and his fourth attack will be further reduced by half," he told his companions.</p>

  <p>Chaim had merged with two Other Shore Tokens. Previously, he had used the Living Puppet Chains several times to transform himself into the puppet of the first Other Shore Token. It allowed his strength to increase exponentially in a short period of time, but the side effect was quite serious.</p>

  <p>The second Other Shore Token was the golden abacus.</p>

  <p>The origin of the abacus was very bizarre. Chaim once had an adventure in a temple on Stage Nine. Inside the temple, he even found a human!</p>

  <p>This human was not in the form of the Soul of Light, but existed as a creature of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Chaim had never heard of human beings living on the Other Shore, so he found it strange.</p>

  <p>At the time, the human had been captured by a golden line and would have died from it, had Chaim not undone the hexes in the temple, releasing him.</p>

  <p>Chaim simply did so because he was saving someone of his kind.</p>

  <p>The human being had been deeply grateful to Chaim. Before he left, he gave Chaim the Other Shore Token, a golden abacus.</p>

  <p>At first, he paid the Other Shore Token no mind. His goal was to step into the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, and his focus was on exploring the temples just to find the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>But he soon found the Other Shore Token could be integrated and released at will. Only after he had fused and merged the golden abacus into his body did Chaim discover its use.</p>

  <p>The abacus didn't give Chaim strength, but it affected his enemy.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to trigger it. Chaim just needed to land a blow on his opponent.</p>

  <p>That was why right from the start, Chaim had asked Milo to help him make sure that he could hit Mount.</p>

  <p>Once contact was made, the abacus would land beside the target. Once it showed up, it couldn't be destroyed. It had a completely opposite effect compared to an ordinary Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Most of the tokens could amplify their owners' Other Shore Power. The golden abacus, however, determined the enemy's strength.</p>

  <p>The power of the blow from Mount reached more than two thousand divine megatons and would have been fatal were it not blocked by Chaim's Latent Theurgy.</p>

  <p>The abacus used this hit to confirm Mount's strength.</p>

  <p>Once it did that, the golden abacus countered the enemy's Other Shore Power, such that no matter how much power Mount released henceforth, the abacus would nullify it, allowing only half the strength of his previous blow.</p>

  <p>The power of every blow Mount launched from here on out would be halved every time until it zeroed out.</p>

  <p>"But be careful. His real skill is not just his power..." Chaim warned, finding it difficult to speak with his injuries.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded, comprehending instantly.</p>

  <p>The power of Mount was secondary. The key point was that he could use the space theurgy at will, which was a great advantage.</p>

  <p>"I... I will take you to the array..." Sally said as she picked up Chaim.</p>

  <p>Although the array couldn't block the attack of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, the mother was entangled by the people from the Separate Abyss race, so the threat shouldn't be too great.</p>

  <p>Mount still hovered in the air. He was lost in thought as he looked at the gold abacus by his side.</p>

  <p>This unique Other Shore Token was unexpectedly effective. He could feel an odd whirlpool in his inner world. Every time he began to extract the Other Shore Power, the whirlpool would absorb most of the power, leaving only a little left.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The people from the Oneness Sky Palace were now gathering to face off with him again, followed closely by the Pear Hill group.</p>

  <p>Chaim risked his life to pave the way for them. They would not waste this chance.</p>

  <p>"I will give you another chance! If you release Zheng, we will let bygones be bygones," Feng Ge called out, glaring daggers at Mount.</p>

  <p>Mount just continued to quietly ponder how to extricate himself from his current predicament.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge grew impatient. When Mount didn't respond, she raised her Warrior of the Stone Hill above her head and slashed at him.</p>

  <p>As soon as Feng Ge began to attack, so did Dorothy and the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The Six Snake Shadows from the Snake Goddess race and Natalie also burst out their Other Shore Power!</p>

  <p>As the sword radiance from all the said people was about to hit Mount, his body turned blurry as he once again teleported away.</p>

  <p>But when he emerged in another spot, Milo was already waiting there and lunged at Mount.</p>

  <p>Mount only gave Milo a sheepish smile. He didn't like it when others were able to read his mind. He was getting tired of Milo's tricks. He teleported again, appearing behind Milo and bearing down a blow on the back of his neck.</p>

  <p>Six hundred divine megatons of force could still be fatal if it hit vital parts.</p>

  <p>But Milo was a peerless genius in the Flow Sword Sect. He reflexively jabbed his sword backward to block Mount's attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Milo did not have Zheng's extraordinary build, so the effect of countering six hundred divine megatons of force was expected. Milo fell to the ground like lead with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was still able to block the strike with his long sword at the last minute. Otherwise, it really would have been fatal.</p>

  <p>After that first strike, the gold abacus beside Mount started rattling again.</p>

  <p>This time, the number it showed was down to six hundred.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Six Snake Shadows formed a huge and mysterious array as they launched themselves at Mount.</p>

  <p>Mount flickered out of his original spot again before his fist landed on a member of the Snake Goddess race, knocking her away. The golden abacus jostled again and reduced the number it showed to three hundred.</p>

  <p>As Mount continued on his attacks, the Other Shore Power he could release was getting weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>One hundred and fifty...Seventy five...</p>

  <p>Thirty two...</p>

  <p>Sixteen...</p>

  <p>Eight...</p>

  <p>When his force was reduced to eight divine megatons, his attack no longer posed any threat.</p>

  <p>Even the weakest disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace were now much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Even so, there was no sign of panic on the face of Mount. Just as Chaim had said, the most important thing Mount relied on was his space theurgy, which was a bloodline theurgy. The golden abacus couldn't deal with his bloodline theurgy at all.</p>

  <p>But Mount was still trying to find out the limits of the abacus. He knew the abacus couldn't possibly be without any limitations.</p>

  <p>As Mount made his way through the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race, a black figure suddenly appeared behind him. The figure burst out in strange laughter.</p>
