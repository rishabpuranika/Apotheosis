<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2924 Laughter In The Passageway </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>As Clement waved the silver blood sword gently, a silver moonlight suddenly appeared not far from Emily.</p>

  <p>It was the silver moonlight that had cut off one of her arms and cut Isla in half.</p>

  <p>However, against Clement's expectations, the silver moonlight only flashed for a second before it disappeared without a trace. It was so fast that it was impossible to perceive the power within it.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>Clement frowned. He carefully observed their surroundings and noticed Ramzi in the distance.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised to see someone among you is proficient in arrays. You can counteract the Slaughtering Moonlight! You are quite good," Clement said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Ramzi ignored Clement's praise. He shouted, "Everyone, leave this place as soon as possible, or you will only get killed. P? " He cut himself off, aware that he had said too much. He almost revealed Lorena's identity. It would've been troublesome if they found out she was their princess. He then said,</p>

  <p>"People from the divine land! Return to the divine land and hide for a while!"</p>

  <p>Holy Beings and Lorena would not be rejected by the divine land, so they could enter and leave as they desired.</p>

  <p>Vanessa hurried towards the divine land almost without any hesitation when she heard that. She had mentioned earlier that if the opponents were too strong, she would retreat to the divine land immediately. After all, the gap between their strength and the Other Shore Realm warriors' was too great.</p>

  <p>However, just as she employed the Grand Teleportation and built a space channel, a pool of silver moonlight suddenly spread out on the ground beneath her feet, blocking the space channel she had built.</p>

  <p>"Even the space channel is blocked?"</p>

  <p>Lorena, Mike, and the others frowned. They had no way to retreat.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Godfrey chuckled. "You're stuck here, and you still want to run? How naive of you!"</p>

  <p>The arrangement of the crescent moons in the sky was a little messy.</p>

  <p>The burning talisman was still disturbing the entire array, but Ramzi was sure that it wouldn't last long. Once the Slaughtering Moonlight Array was restored to normal, everyone would probably be killed by Clement.</p>

  <p>In the Mountain of Holy Beings, the breathing sound kept resounding in Luo Zheng's ears. As he continued to move forward in the maze, it grew louder and louder.</p>

  <p>He had been hearing it for hours now.</p>

  <p>Somehow, he had gradually gotten used to it.</p>

  <p>The time fragments he saw grew slimmer as he traveled deeper into the slender and long alleys of the maze. The surrounding space had become dense and humid.</p>

  <p>These fragments appeared as soft as mud. He reached out his hand in curiosity, and a sharp pain assaulted his fingertips. The pieces were like the seawater in the Time Sea that could cut anything that touched it. However, Luo Zheng's body was far stronger than a Holy Being's. He wasn't afraid of falling into the Time Sea, so he was not afraid of these soft fragments either.</p>

  <p>'Maybe this is the seawater of the Time Sea. It has been solidified over time,</p>

  <p>' Luo Zheng mused.</p>

  <p>He was amazed that time could turn into something tangible like this.</p>

  <p>Not long after, something else Luo Zheng saw confirmed his conjecture. The time fragments on the walls of the maze grew softer and softer. They eventually turned into the colorful seawater that was usually seen in Time Sea.</p>

  <p>However, the seawater seemed to completely ignore the rules of gravity. It had completely integrated into the wall and slowly flowed through it.</p>

  <p>With the guidance of the Infinity Ruler, Luo Zheng went on for another five minutes, before he came upon an even stranger scene.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea on the walls took another form. The fragments disappeared and were replaced by colorful walls as if someone had painted a rainbow on the walls. Only, this rainbow was slowly fluctuating.</p>

  <p>'This is a complete space-time.' Luo Zheng marveled at the walls.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Time Sea was extremely dangerous, was that it was full of fragments of time. However, the complete space-time was different.</p>

  <p>The walls stood for complete space-times, so Luo Zheng was supposed to be able to freely enter and leave the space, just as how he had entered the world in the jade seal when he had been in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng blinked and decided to be discreet.</p>

  <p>He didn't know where the complete space-times led to.</p>

  <p>It would be a bigger trouble if he couldn't get back. 'I'd better follow the guidance of the Infinity Ruler, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he had been surrounded by rhythmic breathing. Now, it had abruptly changed into childish laughter!</p>

  <p>Soon after, a loud echo resounded from ahead. Luo Zheng sensed an astonishing fit of Time Law coming from the depths of the passageway. A colorful spiral occupied the entire passageway, headed straight for him.</p>

  <p>As he realized the amazing power in this spiral, amazement flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes. There was a trace of fear as well.</p>

  <p>'What's this?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng eyed his surroundings. His first instinct was to dodge immediately.</p>

  <p>However, both walls of the passageway were filled with complete space-times, and the huge spiral completely blocked the passageway. To escape, he would have to enter a space-time.</p>

  <p>The spiral was already in front of Luo Zheng. His gaze froze for a second, but he didn't enter a space-time.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what kind of world was inside these space-times, so he avoided them. He used the power of the Time Jade Seal to do this.</p>

  <p>As the colorful spiral crushed Luo Zheng's physical body, he wiped out the time.</p>

  <p>This left him standing in his original place as if nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>He accelerated his speed, but he had not reached far when the cackling laughter returned. At the same time, a rumbling sound rang again in the depths of the passageway. It sounded like another swirling power was rushing toward him.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I'm in big trouble this time...' A wry smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>There was a limit in the use of the Time Jade Seal. He could only use it three times in a short period, or else, the huge bugs hidden in the world would become disobedient.</p>

  <p>No matter how greedy the bugs were, they didn't want to eat if they were full. Although the number of the giant bugs was large, every time the jade seal was used, they were eating the entire world's time. So, there was no problem feeding them, regardless of the brevity of the process.</p>

  <p>When they had devoured time several times in a row, they couldn't consume more.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no other choice. Once again, he used the Time Jade Seal to avoid the spiral.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, the cackling laughter came back, just as he dodged for a second time.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The third spiral was on its way!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clenched his right hand tightly. The Time Jade Seal could be used again, but he hesitated. This would be his last chance.</p>
