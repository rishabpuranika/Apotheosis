<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite her confusion, Feng Ge still jumped into the crater along with Chaim and the others.</p>

  <p>It bewildered Adonis to see Luo Zheng remain standing outside the crater.</p>

  <p>'What does he want to do?</p>

  <p>Is he planning to hunt me in the hurricane?'</p>

  <p>He started to feel nervous at the sight of Chaim's smiling face.</p>

  <p>There was no way for ordinary warriors to fight in the hurricane. Why was Luo Zheng so calm? Did he have any special method?</p>

  <p>The other elites were as baffled as Adonis.</p>

  <p>As the black smog surged violently, the hurricane finally rolled in again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As expected, Adonis and his companions were all pulled up into the air by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng jumped up lightly and followed the hurricane.</p>

  <p>The hurricane was heading north, but Luo Zheng was moving to the west. He was not affected at all by it!</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Adonis's eyes narrowed into slits.</p>

  <p>How could this be?</p>

  <p>Elites from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race felt their hearts sink.</p>

  <p>This hurricane was as strong as three to four thousand Jun of force. It was so strong that nobody who had entered the Chaotic Source World previously could resist it.</p>

  <p>They either found a cave, or made a crater in the ground to hide themselves in. Otherwise, they would be swept away by the hurricane. And there had been no exception, until now.</p>

  <p>Only a few winged creatures could ride the wind, such as the Jin Wu, but even for them, it was impossible to go against the wind!</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?"</p>

  <p>"Is he chasing after us?"</p>

  <p>"But he can't catch up. It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>They took solace in the fact the hurricane blew at a very fast speed, pulling them several miles away in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was not pushed by the hurricane, it would naturally slow him down, they thought.</p>

  <p>But they forgot Luo Zheng could control his movements freely.</p>

  <p>After he rushed westward for a distance, he was right behind them. As the feather on his head flashed a cyan light, a huge shadow of cyan wings sprouted on his back.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now moving with the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Bolstered by the hurricane, he moved at a faster speed.</p>

  <p>After about ten seconds, he had already caught up to an elite from the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>The elite was stricken with horror seeing Luo Zheng lunging at him like an eagle.</p>

  <p>He wanted to fight back, but it was extremely difficult for him to maintain a stable position in the wind. He spun around and shot two flying shuttles of purple light toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The wind slowed the shuttles down. Luo Zheng easily dodged them with a move of his body.</p>

  <p>Just as the elite moved to activate his Other Shore Token, a sword radiance flashed at him and cut him in half.</p>

  <p>This scene drove other elites to despair.</p>

  <p>"Let's split up!"</p>

  <p>"If he catches up to us, we'll be all doomed!"</p>

  <p>They all tried to flee in the same direction, expecting the hurricane's heavy winds to do the work of scattering them. If they used their bodily movement skill to move forward, they would be separated faster.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's explosive speed was still beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>No sooner had they made the decision to split up when Luo Zheng appeared behind them and killed the second elite disciple of the Divine Farmer race before he could even react.</p>

  <p>Realizing that there was no way to escape, the remaining two elites gave up the idea. They immediately activated their Other Shore Tokens to counterattack wildly.</p>

  <p>But now Luo Zheng could fight in the hurricane like a fish in water. Even if the two elites fought back with all their might, it only took Luo Zheng a few seconds to defeat them.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>With a few flashes of sword radiance, the two elites were killed. Blown by the hurricane, their blood quickly dissipated into a mist and was covered by the black smog in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Now, only Adonis was left.</p>

  <p>If he had been confident enough to defeat Luo Zheng before, he would have dug a hole at the same place and just waited for the hurricane to pass before he challenged Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, after hearing what Luo Zheng and Feng Ge said, he had already given up the idea of challenging Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the hurricane came, he panicked as he witnessed Luo Zheng casually flitting around in the hurricane.</p>

  <p>He immediately activated his bodily movement skill and darted forward with the wind.</p>

  <p>Adonis's movement technique was extremely outstanding. Although he was not as good as the winged creatures like the Jin Wu, he was by no means inferior to them. Thus from the beginning, he left the others far behind.</p>

  <p>After he had been fleeing for quite some time, he had looked back and saw that the several elite members who had followed him had been killed. Luo Zheng was now rushing toward him, picking up speed!</p>

  <p>'How fast!' His blood ran cold.</p>

  <p>But he would not be as helpless as the others. With a wave of his hands, he connected his sabers and flipped his body in the wind.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Serrated blades emerged around him. "Go!" he yelled. The blades, which were spinning quickly, darted out.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh</p>

  <p>Countless blades flew at Luo Zheng, containing extremely terrifying power in each.</p>

  <p>An ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm would definitely avoid such aggressive blades.</p>

  <p>That was what Adonis wanted. As long as Luo Zheng slowed down to evade, he would be able to escape!</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, he had always hunted the disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace as his prey. But facing Luo Zheng, he realized that the roles had been reversed.</p>

  <p>He could tell from Luo Zheng's words that he would kill them and members of the Jin Wu, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race and the New Moon race. None of them would be spared.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>The sharp tinkling sounds behind him broke into his thoughts. He turned around and gasped in shock at what he saw.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng even didn't block the blades with his sword. He directly resisted them with his own body and smashed through them!</p>

  <p>What was his body made of?! How could it be so strong? Even a powerful warrior of the Separate Abyss race wouldn't be able to do that!</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Adonis spun faster and threw more blades toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The attack proved futile in slowing down Luo Zheng in any way. He blocked all the blades easily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly rushed over until he was hovering above Adonis. He held his long sword and looked down at Adonis.</p>

  <p>No matter how fierce the hurricane was, the hair on his head kept still. The feather of Wing King was shielding him from the wind's effects completely.</p>

  <p>"Spare me! I can't die!" Adonis pleaded, shouting to be heard above the din of the hurricane.</p>

  <p>He had been cornered. He had no choice now but to beg Luo Zheng for mercy.</p>

  <p>He felt so ashamed and helpless.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the hurricane, he would have been able to take Luo Zheng on instead of being completely under his mercy like this.</p>

  <p>"It's too late for regrets," Luo Zheng said coolly.</p>

  <p>He swung his long sword, bearing down with the wind and slashing at Adonis.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Blood blossomed around the sword radiance as Adonis's body was swept away by the wind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was hovering at great speed, paused mysteriously. He remained floating in the wind for a few moments before turning back where he came from.</p>
