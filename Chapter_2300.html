<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2300 The Origin Of The Forbidden Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The scene in front of him had even cleared the many doubts in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Master Evil informed Luo Zheng that all the divine might coins were found in the forbidden lands. However, Luo Zheng was unsure how they were produced in the first place.</p>

  <p>The life vitality crystal and life vitality jade were condensed by the vitality between heaven and earth. After they gathered for countless years, they formed mines. Even if a mineral vein was dug out, other mineral veins kept growing and replenishing the source. So the life vitality crystal and life vitality jade were almost inexhaustible resources.</p>

  <p>The divine land had been in existence for countless divine eras.</p>

  <p>During this long period of time, countless True Gods had set foot into the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Divine might coins were present in various forbidden lands. Even if there were huge quantities of divine might coins, all of them would be dug out and taken away one day. If this happened, how would the warriors who arrived later find and get their hands on any of these coins?</p>

  <p>According to Master Evil's explanation, a True God who stepped into a forbidden land would always find the divine might coins, which meant that the coins would constantly keep appearing...</p>

  <p>Finally, it all made sense to Luo Zheng. He figured out that the divine might coins were formed by the Faith Energy of the True Gods!</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" The Evil God inquired curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced around until finally his eyes fixed on the giant with one thousand eyes. He then smiled broadly and said, "This is the world you have imagined!"</p>

  <p>"The world we have imagined?" repeated the Evil God. Surprise was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, and suddenly an idea occurred to him. The history of the Monster Slaughtering Continent in the past few years played like a movie in his mind. With the help of his omniscient ability, he quickly found the clues he needed, and then remarked casually, "The Monster Slaughtering Continent belonged to the Howe Clan many years ago."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of the Howe Clan. It's an ancient race," added Evil God nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>The conflict between the Howe Clan and the Totem Clan had begun long before the birth of the Evil God, but the history of the two ancient races had passed down from generation to generation, so mostly everyone was aware of the enmity between these two races.</p>

  <p>"It's recorded in history that the queen of the Howe Clan was exquisitely beautiful, so she seduced a God to help her. Are you the God who aided her?" The Evil God questioned and then asked with a lecherous smile,</p>

  <p>"Is the queen of the Howe Clan as beautiful as she's made out to be in the stories?"</p>

  <p>According to the legend, the queen of the Howe Clan was regarded as the most beautiful woman in history. Her beauty could even blind a God and make him lose his senses. As a man, the Evil God naturally had interest in this on a primal level.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes, it's me. She is indeed a perfect woman."</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Zheng had interfered in the war between the Howe Clan and the Totem Clan, in which he had lent support to the queen of the Howe Clan, although he had not given her much power.</p>

  <p>As the creator of this world, Luo Zheng wouldn't intervene too much. In fact, even now, he could use the mud to create the queen just using his mind, but it was just meaningless to indulge in such things.</p>

  <p>"Back then, the Howe Clan and the Totem Clan were very afraid of the Heavenly Spirit race in the World Tree, so the local mortals hoped that there would be some creature that would be able to bless and protect them!" Luo Zheng continued, "The creature must have a strong and burly body.</p>

  <p>Moreover, its appearance should be terrifying enough to scare off the Heavenly Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>Evil God quickly guessed the rest. "The creature they imagined must be a monster covered with numerous eyes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right," Luo Zheng replied with a smile, nodding.</p>

  <p>In the early days, the Howe Clan could only imagine the giant with three eyes. However, once their imagination was triggered, the picture became more vivid in their minds. More and more members of the Howe Clan started to make up something that didn't exist. As a result, there were giants with ten eyes, a hundred eyes, and even a thousand eyes...</p>

  <p>This was the most primitive form of faith.</p>

  <p>If the Howe Clan had imagined dragons at the very beginning, then what Luo Zheng and the Evil God had encountered there were not these giants, but giant dragons in strange shapes.</p>

  <p>Over countless years, the legend of the giant with one thousand eyes didn't fade, but instead it become a part of the human culture. As generation after generation added to this legend, their imagination turned into subconscious Faith Energy and got accumulated over time. When Zheng's Godly Tile was formed, a forbidden land in the shape of a gourd was formed.</p>

  <p>Why did it take the shape of a gourd? Because it was said that these giants were born from a gourd.</p>

  <p>In the same way, even the Everest Spirit Mountain, the Soul Wilderness and other various forbidden lands were created due to the thoughts of the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>In fact, these thoughts were the basis of Faith Energy. The legends that were passed down through countless divine eras formed many forbidden lands. When a forbidden land appeared, people were more convinced of the existence of the forbidden land, which would in turn cause more forbidden lands to appear. Thus more and more Faith Energy would be produced for the forbidden lands to adsorb and thrive.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reckoned that it was no coincidence that the Everest Spirit Mountain, the Soul Wilderness, the Swirl Forest and the Abyss Demon Region went on to become the four great forbidden lands. It was just that the legends of these four forbidden lands existed at the very beginning and hence had been passed on for the longest time. They were the oldest legends.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was like hell according to the stories of the divine citizens. Everyone believed that they would go to that region after they died. The amount of the Faith Energy that the Abyss Demon Region absorbed was the highest. Therefore, warriors found it was most difficult to explore this region. Even Holy Beings would find it tough to defend themselves if they entered the depths of this region!</p>

  <p>"It's incredible," the Evil God exclaimed as he looked at the giant with one thousand eyes. He never thought that the world would be so wonderful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly pointed his hand at the giant and gently flipped his palm.</p>

  <p>And then an invisible force instantly crushed the giant with thousand eyes into dust!</p>

  <p>"Logically speaking, even if I kill all of the giants here, they will reappear in a certain amount of time. Even the divine might coins in your hands will appear again. You can come in and verify this the next time,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said nonchalantly. "Let's go to the next place to have a look!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded and then asked, "I'm still confused about one thing.</p>

  <p>You said that everything here was imagined, so then what about these divine might coins? Did these black coins also appear in the legend of the Monster Slaughtering Continent?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the divine might coins and shook his head. "These divine might coins are formed by Faith Energy. This forbidden land needs a constant supply of the Faith Energy. This energy gets sucked into this space. After an adequate number of giants have been formed, and the place is saturated with the Faith Energy, it will transform into the divine might coins..."</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's guess too. According to the clues he had gathered, his guess would not be too far from the truth. The only thing he couldn't figure out was why the divine might coins formed from the Faith Energy were black.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng collected all the divine might coins in the forbidden land and took them with him when he left with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng and the Evil God found another forbidden land on the ice land, which was covered by the ray of light-purple light. The ray of light covered a triangular area, which was the same as what happened on the Monster Slaughtering Continent. Luo Zheng was unable to unearth any information about this forbidden land.</p>

  <p>The two encountered a kind of human-shaped snow monster with long hair upon entering this forbidden land. These snow monsters were very powerful in the Evil God's eyes. However, no matter how mighty these fierce creatures were, they wouldn't be able to harm Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found over a hundred divine might coins in this forbidden land, and at the same time he also discovered the legend of the "polar snowman", which proved his guess correct once more.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands in Zheng's inner world had just been established right now, and there weren't many divine might coins in them yet.</p>

  <p>But the time in his inner world ran faster than that of the divine land. As the forbidden lands became larger and larger in the future, the number of divine might coins would also increase.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins could be used to change the laws of the Ruling Slate, but that was not something he could dwell on at this point. The bigger issue for him was to figure out a way to use the Faith Energy in the divine might coin. How would he crack this one?</p>

  <p>This was the topmost priority for Luo Zheng right now.</p>
