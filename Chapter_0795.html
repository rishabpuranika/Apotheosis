<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If they had battled outside the celestial tomb, Zheng probably wouldn't have been able to defeat the prince.</p>

  <p>Despite his strength, it would still be impossible for him to be a worthy contender against a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>The conditions that the celestial tomb had provided greatly increased Zheng's chances. In the tomb, the prince's cultivation level had been suppressed and was only at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. Zheng's cultivation level, on the other hand, had not been suppressed at all. This greatly narrowed the gap between the two.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng had been able to defeat the prince and he knew the exact reason why.</p>

  <p>However, the others weren't aware of such information.</p>

  <p>"Am I daydreaming?"</p>

  <p>"A warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm defeated a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? Even more, the latter was actually from one of the divine kingdoms!"</p>

  <p>"It can only be described as inconceivable!"</p>

  <p>All the warriors sported puzzled looks on their faces and were at a loss for words. They were completely unable to comprehend how Zheng had exactly defeated the prince.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden let out a heart-wrenching cry. "I will flatten the entire Sky Northern Region!" she declared. "I will kill everyone in your clan and annihilate your sect!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes met her malicious gaze. "Let's talk when you've accomplished that," he said lightly.</p>

  <p>For their trip to the celestial tomb, five guards at the Life and Death Realm had accompanied the prince and the Holy Maiden for their protection. They had originally thought that the trip would pass with no hitches. Never did they ever think that the one they were tasked to protect would be killed, not by the tribulations of the mysterious and dangerous celestial tomb, but by the hands of a mere warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>What was even more unacceptable was that the two of them had faced each other fairly on the battle stage.</p>

  <p>What was exactly going on with the Sky Northern Region? How could such a person be born? Because of the sudden turn of events, the warriors at the Life and Death Realm started to think about long-term problems.</p>

  <p>For the Holy Maiden though, there was only one thing on her mind and that was to seek revenge for what Zheng had done to the prince.</p>

  <p>Back in the divine kingdom, her status was very high, only second to the crown prince.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of princes in the divine kingdom. For mortals, an emperor only had a lifespan of about a hundred years and would be able to produce a few dozen children at most. However, a warrior emperor had a lifespan of a few maybe even ten thousand years. Thus he would be able to have many women and countless children.</p>

  <p>In the divine kingdom, only the most excellent had the right to be the crown prince and all the others would be considered ordinary princes and their status wouldn't even be comparable to some ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden had been born to be worshiped. Her life was comfortable but she did not have any friends and was often lonely. The prince Zheng had just killed had been her friend since she was young, and he was the one who had brought her to explore the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>He was her only friend, but Zheng had just ended his life. How could she not hate him?</p>

  <p>As the beam of light rotated once again, she fixed her eyes on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the light pointed at her. Her eyes narrowed slightly and the dice suddenly moved.</p>

  <p>"Six!"</p>

  <p>A black disk appeared in front of her, and within that disk was a thin white line.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden did not give it much thought and, with gentle steps, quickly stepped onto the round disk.</p>

  <p>"You can kill anyone present," the voice said. Her eyes widened at the realization.</p>

  <p>"Kill anyone!"</p>

  <p>A vicious smile appeared on her face as she gave Zheng a cold, chilling smile.</p>

  <p>Yudie, however, was the exact opposite. This round, the Holy Maiden had the right to kill anyone.</p>

  <p>Just now, the elder from the Mysterious Luna Hall had already displayed what "kill anyone" meant. Such was the true power of an immortal; no one present would be able to stand up to it.</p>

  <p>Even a warrior such as Elderly Luna had no power to resist and was directly killed by an invisible force. It was true annihilation.</p>

  <p>At that moment, by the decree of the celestial tomb, everyone's life was in the hands of the Holy Maiden. And this was simply irresistible.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's in trouble. He just killed the prince. The Holy Maiden will surely choose him."</p>

  <p>"Ha, that's not necessarily true. Have you forgotten just how many crises Zheng has escaped from the very beginning? Not only did the purple flames not burn Zheng to death, but it has also somehow made him even more powerful. Even the prince at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could not kill Zheng. He is the incarnation of a monster!"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily? This should be an immortal's power. How could a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm compare to an immortal? Zheng is sure to die this time!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't a matter of strength, skill, or perseverance. If an immortal decreed your death, wouldn't you die?</p>

  <p>When the Holy Maiden obtained the chance to "kill anyone," Eddie let out a deep exhale. When Zheng had defeated the prince, a flash of fear had entered Eddie's heart. A kid as lucky and as strong as Zheng needed to be killed early on lest he became a bigger problem in the future.</p>

  <p>However, they just couldn't fight anyone they wanted while in the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>But, because of what the Holy Maiden had rolled, there would be no more need for him to worry. Zheng was definitely sure to die and nobody would be able to save him Unless Zheng had a second life!</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance all looked at each other and shook their heads. This was bad.</p>

  <p>They did not want Zheng to die. First of all, he had promised the sect-protecting array that he would set up for them. Second of all, Zheng was a runic expert and his business value was more important to them than the Cloud hall's.</p>

  <p>It was truly a pity!</p>

  <p>A lot of the other warriors shook their heads in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Yudie couldn't stop herself. "If you dare kill Zheng, I will hunt you down until I die!"</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" The Holy Maiden smiled at her. "I am the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom. You seem to be a sect leader of a mere fourth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>What are you going to use to hunt me?"</p>

  <p>Yudie's face scrunched up in fury. "Use this!" she said before biting her tongue and blowing gently.</p>

  <p>A hexagonal blood snowflake formed on her hand that she lightly patted. It began to spin.</p>

  <p>In the chasm, everyone's position was separated by an enchanted barrier. No one could leave their disk, nor could anyone use their attack methods since they would all be blocked by the enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>However, the blood snowflake Yudie had formed flew towards the Holy Maiden and easily passed through the enchanted barriers. Without any warning, the blood snowflake instantly drilled itself into the Holy Maiden's body.</p>

  <p>"Tia…" Imogen called out softly. Although the outsiders had no idea what Yudie had done, she knew exactly what technique had been used. She was the one who passed down the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess to Yudie after all.</p>

  <p>The curse Yudie had unleashed was done at the cost of burning her blood essence.</p>

  <p>For all her life, the Holy Maiden would become Yudie's target, until her death.</p>

  <p>Moreover, both of them would be covered in curses and they would spend a third of every year being affected by the extremely painful cold poison.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't exactly know what Yudie had done, he could vaguely guess that the price she had to pay wasn't small.</p>

  <p>At that moment, even his heart had also been filled with fear.</p>

  <p>The methods of an immortal were too powerful and he wasn't really sure if he could rely on his tricks this time around.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden gave Zheng a mournful smile, but her eyes were cold with resentment and fury. "Die!" she shouted, pointing at him.</p>

  <p>He had killed her friend after all, so it was only natural for her to wish Zheng death.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Maiden declared her choice, everyone turned to look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>A light breeze suddenly brew. Zheng felt an invisible force rush towards him as if some kind of invisible death god had come to his side.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful strength!"</p>

  <p>Although it was invisible, Zheng could clearly sense its existence as it came from the side of his head.</p>

  <p>He almost raised his hands subconsciously to cover his head because of it.</p>

  <p>His body had just undergone the tempering of the Fiery Star Flame and he, after absorbing so much, had become a top-grade fairy weapon. In fact, he was only a step away from becoming a sacred weapon so he didn't believe that this invisible force had the power to snuff him out in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Under the suppression of the huge, otherworldly force, two bloody wounds suddenly appeared on Zheng's arms that spurted blood as if they were fountains.</p>
