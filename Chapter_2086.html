<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Soul Searching Flag had once been Murphy's most precious treasure. However, after he became a Holy Being, this sort of treasure was of no value to him. Therefore, he passed it on to his favorite disciples.</p>

  <p>The Soul Searching Flag had passed through several pairs of hands before it had reached Marko's.</p>

  <p>Not only could the flag capture souls, but it could also imprison them within and constantly refine them. In time, the souls would be enslaved.</p>

  <p>Besides all of this, the flag could also amplify the perception.</p>

  <p>Once Blayd had erased the soul mark on the flag, Luo Luo Zheng was finally able to easily hold it in his hand.</p>

  <p>The flag was a soul-related supreme primordial weapon, and was highly valuable to Luo Luo Zheng. After expressing his thanks, he stored it safely in his space ring.</p>

  <p>At that moment, an awesome roar could be heard resounding from the mist in the depths of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Woodruff Zhan! Why did a member of your War God Hall appear in the Evolutionary Universe? And he actually killed my beloved disciple! Get him to leave at once!"</p>

  <p>Naturally, the one who had been roaring was Murphy.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, the defeat of the Evolutionary Universe was already an established fact.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one who thought like that. The Holy Beings in the Hall of Holy Beings had also come to the same conclusion. The living beings in the Evolutionary Universe were clinging to life with their last breaths. They had no chance of survival unless Mike could come back to life overnight and save the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings were silently watching the war in the universe unfold, another True God had suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>The moment Blayd appeared, the Holy Beings knew instantly where he came from. The person who suddenly appeared had to be from the War God Hall. The War God Hall was one of the several great powers within the divine land. Moreover, three Holy Beings from the War God Hall had joined the Hall of Holy Beings. In strength, they far exceeded Murphy.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" A hearty laugh rang from the clouds. "Blayd is alive!" A hint of ecstasy could be detected in the voice.</p>

  <p>"Woodruff, I require an explanation from you. What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Murphy's voice turned cold.</p>

  <p>"An explanation? Murphy, you altered the rules written on the stone slab, which is entirely unacceptable. You know that the reason that we set up the Hall of Holy Beings is to restrain each other, so that we can follow the rules. Did my clansman break the rules by entering the Evolutionary Universe?" Woodruff laughed without humor.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. According to the rules set out on the stone slab, the Evolutionary Universe is permitted to send three True Gods," the voice of Holy Jay replied.</p>

  <p>"If so, why should Blayd retreat? Just because of your words? Or because your head is larger than mine? Hahahaha!" Once again Woodruff laughed maniacally.</p>

  <p>The people of the War God Hall had always acted with arrogance, and Woodruff was the leader of the group. How could he be willing to demonstrate weakness to Murphy?</p>

  <p>The truth was that the Holy Beings had already seen through the divine land, and their words usually didn't come with such a strong smell of gunpowder. However, Blayd had a particularly unique effect on the War God Hall, so understandably, Woodruff did all that he could to protect him.</p>

  <p>As Woodruff retorted, Murphy forced himself to calm down.</p>

  <p>There was no certainty that the Murphy Universe would lose to Blayd.</p>

  <p>After all, they still possessed Mateo.</p>

  <p>Thus, the depths of the divine land returned to tranquility, but the Holy Beings were left pondering in their hearts. Some of them were convinced that Mike wasn't fated to die, while others of them were abnormally angry. At the start, they had been quite certain of their victory, but the sudden change had made them worried.</p>

  <p>By this time, the Ancestral Dragon was riddled with wounds. Most of the beautiful scales on its body had peeled off, and half of its tail had been severed. Even the sword-like horns on its head were now missing.</p>

  <p>However, it still displayed an extremely strong vitality. Every time it was smashed down by Pranav, it would climb up again. Even though it was deeply wounded, it refused to cower.</p>

  <p>Marko's panicked voice was not able to reach this place. Pranav didn't believe that there was anything in the Evolutionary Universe capable of threatening Marko.</p>

  <p>"You're continuing to struggle."</p>

  <p>An expression of malevolence appeared on Pranav's face. The nine dragons and the Ancestral Dragon were truly tenacious. They would never willingly give up.</p>

  <p>However, the Ancestral Dragon was now like a spent arrow, and Pranav was planning to end its life. Six-clawed dragons were incredibly rare in the divine land, but since the Ancestral Dragon had already fully grown, he couldn't subdue it as his spiritual pet or contractual beast. His only choice was to kill it first, and then crush those annoying dragons later.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon, which was crawling above the supreme world, raised its head. It seemed to lack the strength to fly, so it could only prostrate on the ground and breathe towards Pranav. However, its demonic red breath had weakened, so it had already lost its threat and disappeared before it got close to Pranav.</p>

  <p>Pranav again leaped towards the Ancestral Dragon. In his hand was the ghost-head halberd. As he waved the halberd, a dark red light was emitted from the eyes of the ghost head. The ghost-head halberd was also a supreme primordial weapon, and a treasure that was connected to its owner.</p>

  <p>After easily avoiding the weakened breath of the Ancestral Dragon several times, Pranav once again stood on its head and raised the ghost-head halberd high into the air.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The two nearest Genuine Dragons rushed over at the same time.</p>

  <p>The nine dragons' heavenly bodies had already been repeatedly destroyed, so their surface colors were now much dimmer. Every time their heavenly bodies were destroyed, the recovery speed was slower.</p>

  <p>The other seven dragons' heavenly bodies were slowly recovering, and only the Five-clawed Golden Dragon and the cyan dragon were able to move.</p>

  <p>Facing the two massive bodies, Pranav suddenly turned the halberd in his hand and directed two killing forces towards the two dragons. The moment the forces touched the dragons' heavenly bodies, they were completely destroyed, turning into countless bits of heavenly essence that scattered everywhere. Once the heavenly essence landed on the ground, it gathered itself towards one location, but it would take a long time for the whole body to condense together once again.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene unfolding, the Ancestral Dragon raised its head furiously to hold Pranav up.</p>

  <p>Pranav stood on the head of the Ancestral Dragon and stabilized his body. After snorting coldly, he stomped on the head of the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon's gigantic head was once again smashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Now the Ancestral Dragon had finally lost its strength. It tried its best to raise up its head. However, no matter how many times it struggled, it was in vain. Its pair of large eyes were filled with sorrow, and it could only continuously whimper.</p>

  <p>Pranav turned the ghost-head halberd slightly and aimed the tip at the Ancestral Dragon. A circle of red light spread out from the ghost head.</p>

  <p>He was condensing a strange power!</p>

  <p>No matter how tenacious the vitality of the Ancestral Dragon might be, it would not be able to withstand the damage caused by the halberd.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! I really don't have the time to fight with you anymore!"</p>

  <p>Pranav had been trapped by the treasure of Supreme Lord of Original Sin earlier and had then been fighting with the nine dragons and the Ancestral Dragon for a long while. He had certainly wasted a great deal of time.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he stabbed the ghost-head halberd into the head of the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>But just as the halberd was about to touch the Ancestral Dragon's head, a bronze fist, larger in size than Pranav's head, suddenly appeared in front of him. With this bronze colored fist coming at him, he no longer had sufficient time to kill the Ancestral Dragon. He instinctively placed the ghost-head halberd horizontally in front of him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With the impact of the first punch, his ghost-head halberd had been bent from the middle.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his supreme primordial weapon had suffered such damage from a single punch, he felt a chill growing in his heart.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, the second punch landed on the ghost-head halberd.</p>

  <p>With this blow, the halberd became even more bent.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>When the third punch smashed down, the halberd broke apart, and that massive fist smashed into Pranav's chest.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>These three punches seemed insignificant, but they contained an unimaginable power. Pranav spat out blood, and his whole body flew backwards, leaving a long, thin line of blood trailing behind it.</p>

  <p>Despite the impact, he wasn't dead. He was sure that these three punches could have killed him. It was just that their strength had weakened at the last moment. The attacker must have deliberately suppressed it.</p>

  <p>Now he was facing a very strong enemy, but it seemed like his enemy intended to spare his life. What was his purpose?</p>

  <p>His mind spun rapidly as he came to this conclusion. He then looked up and saw a tall, sturdy man with disheveled hair standing close by. The three punches from before had been given to him by this long-haired man.</p>

  <p>"Alright, that guy is dying. Go and make your wish come true," Blayd said calmly.</p>

  <p>In order to fight against Pranav, Luo Luo Zheng had in the past resorted to the Great Wishing Spell. He might not be a match for Pranav, but he would still be able to fulfill his promise with someone else's help, as long as he personally killed Pranav.</p>
