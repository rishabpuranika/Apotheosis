<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1166 War King's Anger </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>They weren't sure that the pickax in Zheng's hand was the Black Star that had been sealed within the golden leaf.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was the first to react among them.</p>

  <p>A divine-level talent of the York Divine Kingdom was quick to react.</p>

  <p>When he saw that many of the Soul Sea Realm warriors had zeroed in on Luo Zheng, he immediately sent Lucien a voice message through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Lucien had his own suspicions when he saw the black pickax, but he couldn't be sure. He could not believe that Luo Zheng had retrieved the Black Star pickax. However, after the divine-level talent's reminder to him, his doubts were replaced by eagerness.</p>

  <p>Before the many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could react, War Emperor York's figure flashed. Instantly, he was beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was so fast that by the time Turner and War King Wind realized what had happened, the pickax was already in his possession. A look of ecstasy crossed his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood on the edge of the pyramid and looked faintly at the overjoyed War Emperor York. He almost rolled his eyes.</p>

  <p>He didn't resist War Emperor York. The pickax wouldn't have been taken away so easily from him if he had put up a fight. If Luo Zheng had used the power of the four thousand dragon scales, War Emperor York would have been unable to snatch the weapon from him.</p>

  <p>However, there was a large chasm between Zheng's strength and that of War Emperor York's. Luo Zheng didn't want to anger the ruler too much and force him to attack him.</p>

  <p>In any case, the supreme divine weapon had already acknowledged Luo Zheng as its master. War Emperor York might have managed to get his hands on it, but it would be of no use to him.</p>

  <p>"Black Star pickax! It's really Black Star pickax!" The War Emperor York's face betrayed a euphoric expression as he laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>A lot of treasures were hidden within the leaves of the top three layers of the tree. Soul Core, in particular, was extremely critical to the four divine kingdoms. Up until now, they could only place their hopes on the mineral-devouring bugs, but those bugs rarely climbed up to the top to eat the ores.</p>

  <p>If War Emperor York possessed the pickax, he would be able to mine the leaf at the top.</p>

  <p>"Is it really the Black Star pickax?"</p>

  <p>"How was it taken out?"</p>

  <p>"Did Tianxing dig it out of the leaf on the thirty-fifth layer? How did he do it?""</p>

  <p>Many of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm had tried to extract the Black Star pickax without success. It came as a shock to them that the pick was truly the Black Star. Some of them were just tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>"Was it really Tianxing who dug it out?" War King Wind asked Fiona.</p>

  <p>Fiona nodded. "That's right. We saw it with our own eyes. Luo Zheng crushed the golden leaf on the thirty-fifth layer."</p>

  <p>"This...how did he do it?" War King Wind was regretful. If he had known about this earlier, he would not have gone to the Mysterious Dream Secret Land earlier this year. Instead, they would have come straight to the Feather Emperor Secret Land. He had missed out on a good show, but what was worse was that the Black Star pickax had fallen into the hands of War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>York Divine Kingdom had used the little monster to deter the other three divine kingdoms in the past. It wasn't great for the Black Star pickax to fall into the hands of War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Turner frowned as well. Luo Zheng was from the Harlen Divine Kingdom after all. How could Lucien snatch the pickax away from him just like that?</p>

  <p>Turner approached the pyramid, all the while keeping his eyes on Lucien. "Lucien, as the king of a divine kingdom, aren't you ashamed to steal something from a young lad, your junior?"</p>

  <p>"Ashamed? Humph! Turner, don't tell me you don't want it!" War Emperor York couldn't reign in on his excitement as he held the Black Star pickax. Even the silent Luo Zheng became endearing in his eyes. The grudge he held against Luo Zheng seemed to have vanished completely.</p>

  <p>Heavenly Thunder Halberd and the Heart Condensation Necklace were nothing compared to this Black Star pickax.</p>

  <p>The heart-condensing gem in the Heart Condensation Necklace had been retrieved from the abdomen of a purple mineral-devouring bug. As long as War Emperor York had this Black Star pickax in his possession, he would be able to collect the heart-condensing gems every year.</p>

  <p>More importantly, with the Black Star pickax, he could mine the Soul Cores at the top of the tree as he pleased. Even now, there were many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm eagerly waiting their chance to get the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>"But this pickax was dug out by Tianxing. It belongs to him!" Seeing the scene before her, Fiona couldn't hold her tongue any longer. There was even a trace of anger in her voice.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York ignored her and continued to gaze at the Black Star pickax. Just as when Luo Zheng had obtained it, he finally realized that he couldn't control the pickax. In the past few minutes itself, War Emperor York had tried a variety of methods to bring it under his control.</p>

  <p>Pouring his life vitality onto it, dripping his blood on it, the soul imprint, the sensory perception force...</p>

  <p>The Black Star pickax was tossed and turned in the hands of War Emperor York, but none of the methods seemed to work.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sported a mocking expression on his face. He looked at War Emperor York, then smiled at Fiona. "Fiona, don't worry. The pickax is meant to be mine. No one can steal it from me."</p>

  <p>Fiona's bright eyes blinked as a smile surfaced on her face. Just now, Luo Zheng had set up a huge pit, isolating himself from the outside world. She guessed he had perhaps made the Black Star pickax recognize him as its master in there.</p>

  <p>No one knew how Luo Zheng had managed to do it. However, War Emperor York seemed visibly frustrated about the weapon.</p>

  <p>After a while, his expression grew glum. He could do nothing about the pickax. He had heard Zheng's words. War Emperor York turned to look at him, shouting, "Luo Zheng! Did you make this pickax recognize you as its master?"</p>

  <p>The gazes of the other kingdom leaders were locked on Luo Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>Turner and War King Wind would be glad of it if Luo Zheng were to be the true master of the Black Star pickax. Scott said nothing and was neutral.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly and nodded. "Yes, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me how you did it. Otherwise, make no mistake, I will take your life!" War Emperor York did not know how Luo Zheng had managed to get the Black Star pickax to recognize him as its master. He had to wring it out of him!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng laughed at this. "How interesting! I dug out this Black Star pickax from the golden leaf, and it has recognized me as its master. But you stole it from me. Now you expect me to tell you how it recognized its master? Are you deluded? You are a sovereign of a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Your shamelessness is appalling!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, War Emperor York's facial expression was neutral. After all, this supreme divine weapon was far too important. After thinking about it for quite a while, he seemed to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Should he just attack Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Wind and Turner would never condone it. Threatening wouldn't work on Luo Zheng. After thinking for a while, he said, "Tell me the method to make the pickax recognize me as its master, and York Divine Kingdom will fulfill your wishes for the rest of your life! York Divine Kingdom can even groom you. We will spare no resources. All of the martial houses and secret training grounds will be open to you!"</p>

  <p>Intimidating him would be of no use. The only option War Emperor York had was to tempt him.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Turner couldn't help but roll his eyes. Was Lucien foolish enough to think that Luo Zheng was born yesterday? Harlen Divine Kingdom could already give Luo Zheng whatever York Divine Kingdom promised him.</p>

  <p>There wouldn't be too much of a difference in resources. How could War Emperor York expect Luo Zheng to renounce a supreme divine weapon for what he was promising?</p>

  <p>"Lucien, give it back to Luo Zheng," Turner said. "Since the Black Star pickax has already accepted its owner, we can get Luo Zheng to help us mine the Soul Cores."</p>

  <p>"Humph, I, a dignified war emperor, need the help of a young fellow?"</p>

  <p>Lucien snorted, extremely reluctant to return the pickax.</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>Flames burst out from beneath the feet of the fuming War King Wind, each flame transforming into a nimble fire bird. The fire birds hovered around him. This was War King Wind's domain: the Firebird.</p>

  <p>"You may not need Zheng's help, but we do! All these years, we have tolerated you, while you have become more and more insufferable! I would rather leave this Black Star pickax in the hands of an outsider than let you have it! Lucien, return the Black Star pickax to Luo Zheng at once or we fight!"</p>

  <p>This time, War King Wind was truly enraged.</p>
