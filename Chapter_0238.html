<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 238 Seymour Took His Own Life </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng could borrow the energy from the Phoenix Crystal to improve his speed and avoid Seymour's attack, he knew that he would end up being beheaded by Seymour if he wouldn't fight back.</p>

  <p>'I can't hide forever. I must fight back!' he thought as he dodged an attack from Seymour.</p>

  <p>Before the attack, Luo Zheng planned to kill Seymour using the assimilation attack of the demonic life energy. But he realized that his opponent was not an ordinary nature creature but an Illuminating Soul Realm master.</p>

  <p>'If only the giant black hawk can hit Seymour, I might have a chance to win this battle. But damn, he moves so fast! My black hawk can't do anything to him at his speed! What should I do?' Luo Zheng thought anxiously.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, Seymour drew his sword and attacked him. With the burning life vitality on his back, Seymour cast a shadow that grew bigger as he got closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The growing dark figure awakened Luo Zheng from his deep thoughts, but before he could figure out what was happening, he felt a sharp pain on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?" Despite the damage he made to Luo Zheng, Seymour was disappointed at the result of his attack.</p>

  <p>Although his sword had no cutting edge, it was still a mid-grade spiritual weapon. He intended to cut off Zheng's shoulder first before finally cutting his body in half. Unexpectedly, when his sword hit Zheng's body, he felt a tremendous resistance.</p>

  <p>"That's a surprise. But your bones can't be that hard. There must be something protecting your body," Seymour, floating in the air, said to Luo Zheng directly. "I guess I just need to chop your body bit by bit."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng already had spiritual textures on his chest. His body had become a middle-grade spiritual weapon and become stronger.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how strong his body was, he could still feel the pain that Seymour's sword left on his shoulder. If he couldn't kill this man today, he would be the one to die.</p>

  <p>'No more hiding! Hiding won't keep me alive and won't certainly kill this ferocious man! If I want to kill him, then I should be fiercer than him!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Stop trying! You won't defeat me even if you reach the natural level and use your life vitality. You won't stand a chance against me even if I am injured!"</p>

  <p>Seymour said. The cyan life vitality on his back suddenly began to burn violently. He transformed into a cyan line and dashed towards Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>'Stop dodging!' Luo Zheng commanded himself. He stood his ground with determination in his eyes.</p>

  <p>'I will do everything to defeat him even if it costs me my life!'</p>

  <p>More than one hundred dragon scales lit up simultaneously in Zheng's body, while the broken flying blade flew towards Seymour.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng controlled the black hawk and it flew towards him.</p>

  <p>"Shashing!"</p>

  <p>Seymour dodged the surprise attack from the broken flying blade. He had his sword in his hands and was ready to attack Luo Zheng in an instant. He was aiming for his neck so he could cut his head off. 'No matter how hard your bones are, I can cut you into pieces! I am an Illuminating Soul Realm master and I can defeat you!' Seymour thought.</p>

  <p>"Bam! Bash!"</p>

  <p>Seymour instantly attacked Luo Zheng, but instead of dodging it, the latter used his bare hands to hold the blade.</p>

  <p>The blade pierced through Zheng's flesh and got stuck in his bones. Blood flowed from his wound to the sword.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng had already activated over a hundred dragon scales and grasped Seymour's sword like a powerful giant.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?" Seymour tried to pull his sword out from Zheng's hands but failed. He didn't expect that Luo Zheng could become stronger and tougher in an instant. 'Damn it! A man half-step into the nature level could not have such great power!'</p>

  <p>Seymour tried to pull his sword out again with all his strength and it moved a few inches out. The blade cut between Zheng's arms and ribs causing more blood to spatter.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no intention to let it go. His eyes were glowing with determination to win this fight.</p>

  <p>'I've been in the life-and-death situations before and this one is no different. Whether I live or die, I shall give my all into this fight!'</p>

  <p>Seymour tried to draw the sword out of Zheng's body, but still to no avail.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the huge black hawk was flying towards him fast. He started to get anxious.</p>

  <p>He fought many battles to get to where he was today. Although his opponent was only a half-step into the nature level, Seymour still didn't belittle him. Every attack he made towards Luo Zheng was with full force and he didn't show any mercy.</p>

  <p>When he knew that there was no way he could retrieve his sword from Zheng's body, he gave up and stepped back.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slyly smiled and said, "You're backing out? It's too late!"</p>

  <p>A brown Spiritual Thorn popped up behind him and stabbed Seymour's head.</p>

  <p>Seymour became an Illuminating Soul Realm master through hard work.</p>

  <p>He not only trained his body but also refined his soul with secret methods.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Spiritual Thorn suddenly appeared out of nowhere and stabbed Seymour, but it didn't affect him at all.</p>

  <p>He might be in pain but didn't fall in agony like any other ordinary soldiers.</p>

  <p>The attack distracted Seymour for a moment.</p>

  <p>And at that moment, the giant black hawk flew down on him from the sky.</p>

  <p>After he recovered from pain caused by the Spiritual Thorn, Seymour slowly came back to his senses.</p>

  <p>Just as when he was about to step back and take cover, he realized that the black hawk with the Phoenix Crystal energy was only a few feet away.</p>

  <p>Given that he had no time to react, he shouted, "Blue-jade Enchanted Barrier!"</p>

  <p>Seymour wasn't good at using any enchanted barrier; however, he would usually use one to save his life in times like this.</p>

  <p>He didn't use this trick since he became an Illuminating Soul Realm master, and he didn't think he would use it again to deal with a half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>An oval-shaped, green enchanted barrier wrapped Seymour.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>It was just about the right time when the "blue-jade enchanted barrier" completely wrapped Seymour, the black hawk hit it with huge demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>The "blue-jade enchanted barrier" was stable, and it successfully protected Seymour from the attack of the black hawk.</p>

  <p>Seymour smiled when he saw that his enchanted barrier successfully blocked out the purplish-black life energy. Although he almost lost the battle because of his own negligence, he was glad to be still alive.</p>

  <p>'That was close! For now, I must protect myself first, but my next attack will surely kill him!' Seymour stayed inside of the translucent "blue-jade enchanted barrier" with fury in his eyes. 'I will never let him die easily! I will torture him until he bleeds to death!'</p>

  <p>"This blue-jade enchanted barrier is as strong as Yolande's enchanted barriers," Luo Zheng thought. He pulled out the sword from his ribs and threw it back, and the sword fell onto a huge pillar of the pavilion.</p>

  <p>As he endured the pain of his body, he activated the Emerald Crystal and hit the "blue-jade enchanted barrier"</p>

  <p>"Try as you might, but it won't work! Even an Illuminating Soul Realm master cannot break my blue-jade enchanted barrier, so how can a half-step to the nature level defeat me in this?" Seymour laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>But his laugh broke off quickly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's attack left a red crack on his "blue-jade enchanted barrier". The lad then swung his fist and slammed onto the crack again.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The cracks on "blue-jade enchanted barrier" were getting larger.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the red energy was slowly penetrating through the cracks. Seymour wanted to activate his life vitality to repair the cracks, but the red energy was stopping him.</p>

  <p>"No! This can't be happening! This is impossible!" Seymour screamed when he realized that the red energy was penetrating his "blue-jade enchanted barrier". He could imagine the fate he was about to face once the enchanted barrier broke.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to die. Let me go, please. I promise I won't hurt you again!"</p>

  <p>Seymour pleaded.</p>

  <p>Standing just outside the "blue-jade enchanted barrier" and looking at Seymour's pathetic face, Luo Zheng replied coldly, "That's not what you just said earlier."</p>

  <p>"Please! I had no idea how strong you are until this happened!" Seymour continued to plead, "I really don't want to die. I can't die."</p>

  <p>"But you forget this," Luo Zheng pointed at Seymour, "There could only be one winner in the Desperate Melee."</p>

  <p>The "blue-jade enchanted barrier" soon became unstable as was fully covered with red cracks.</p>

  <p>"Clack!"</p>

  <p>And when it couldn't bear the pressure, the "blue-jade enchanted barrier" finally broke into pieces like glass.</p>

  <p>Seymour tried to escape when the enchanted barrier broke to avoid the attack from the black hawk.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to dash out, there was a dull thud. Seymour's eyes widened in horror, and the pain was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>There was a hole in Seymour's head and a lot of blood was coming out of it. And he fell to the ground lifeless.</p>

  <p>The broken flying blade was there all along. Luo Zheng threw it outside the enchanted barrier in advance to stop Seymour if he ever tried to escape.</p>

  <p>In other words, Seymour took his own life.</p>

  <p>Seymour died and the battle finally ended. After Zheng's life energy vanished, he descended slowly to the ground.</p>
