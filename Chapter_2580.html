  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking at Romeo's nervous expression, Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "Why should I mind? Since she and I are peers, she doesn't have to pay too much attention to courtesy when she talks to me."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's blood purity had been checked, it had been confirmed that the blood of the Nine Li race was running through his veins, and thus, he had successfully become a member of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes of the Nine Li people, he was different from them.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the elders or the other members, they all sported an expression of awe when they looked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng had been identified as the grandson of the Grand Chieftain.</p>

  <p>The difference between his status and theirs could not disappear just because they were from the same bloodline.</p>

  <p>Elsa, however, didn't treat Luo Zheng like he was superior to her. She wrinkled her delicate nose and asked Romeo curiously, "That's right. Why should he mind?"</p>

  <p>"Fine." Romeo laughed as he tapped his forehead with his thumb.</p>

  <p>Monty and Yeoman also came over to Luo Zheng after seeing how casual and easygoing he was.</p>

  <p>After some conversation, the young people soon became familiar with one another.</p>

  <p>Among these five people, Luo Zheng was definitely the strongest, followed by Elsa. Romeo was on par with Monty, and Yeoman was a little weaker than them. After all, he had only joined the team after Chandler's death.</p>

  <p>Before that, there had been no chance of him representing the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>As the huge bone ship soared across the sky at an extremely fast speed, it passed a large mass of brown clouds formed by chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to prevent the chaotic energy from surging into the bone ship, but the Wild Gods didn't seem to be bothered by it. In fact, Elsa took a deep breath to revel in the freshness of these clouds.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng watched this scene, he felt that his definition of life was going to change once again.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of the people born in this world were just ordinary people. Even if they cultivated to become Wild Gods, they were still inferior to the True Gods of the divine land in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>And yet, although only Holy Beings could resist chaotic energy in the divine land, no one in this world took it seriously. What fascinated Luo Zheng was that these people were not Other Shore Realm warriors or extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng pondered over this, the bone ship rushed out of the clouds.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a towering bone tower came into view.</p>

  <p>"We've arrived at Sky South Bone Tower!" yelled Elsa, blinking her moon-like eyes. "I must get it back for our race this time!"</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Nine Li race and Yellow Emperor race had constantly fought over the Sky South Bone Tower. After many vicious battles, both races had used up so many resources that they'd had to put their war over the bone tower on hold.</p>

  <p>But now, the time had finally come to put an end to all of this.</p>

  <p>Romeo, Monty, Yeoman, and the others became cautious. This battle was too important to them.</p>

  <p>Compared to them, Luo Zheng looked relaxed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's goal was to leave this world. If he could take exiles with him and find a use for them, it would be even better. This bone tower was nothing to him, and he believed that the old man and the others must be of the same view.</p>

  <p>'Just think of it as training, ' Luo Zheng said to himself.</p>

  <p>As the bone ship approached the Sky South Bone Tower, a small soybean grew on top of the tower. As the bean turned over, it quickly turned into a big eye.</p>

  <p>"I have eyes on Luo Zheng! I have eyes on Luo Zheng!" said No. 9527 as it looked at Luo Zheng through that eye from afar.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had been injected with the blood marrow, the brain masters had ordered No. 9527 to observe Luo Zheng carefully.</p>

  <p>But No. 9527 could only observe Luo Zheng when Luo Zheng was around the bone towers. Soon after Luo Zheng had flown out of Sky Spirit Bone Tower in the bone ship, it had lost Luo Zheng's whereabouts. But now that Luo Zheng was near Sky South Bone Tower, it could track him again.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is going to that city. It is too far from here...</p>

  <p>I need a bigger eye to see things more clearly."</p>

  <p>Grmmm...</p>

  <p>The eye soon grew from the size of a fist into a giant eye that was a thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the eye was embedded in a bone tower that was as wide as the divine land. In comparison, it was still as small as dust, so naturally, no one would notice it.</p>

  <p>However, through this eye, No. 9527 could see everything in the city below, including what Luo Zheng was doing there.</p>

  <p>The bone ship passed the bone tower and advanced to the other side.</p>

  <p>Soon, it landed in the center of the city.</p>

  <p>This city was called Flying Sickle City. It was a neutral city.</p>

  <p>However, although Flying Sickle City was known to be neutral, the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race had both placed their own forces in this city, and these affiliated sects fought amongst themselves, both openly and secretly.</p>

  <p>The bone ship landed with a loud boom.</p>

  <p>Adele and the other elders of the Nine Li race alighted the bone ship first, followed by Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>Soon, about thirty Wild Gods rushed over, bowing respectfully toward Adele and the others.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Grand Elder!" they greeted in unison.</p>

  <p>These Wild Gods belonged to the Nine Li race's sects. Therefore, they didn't dare to slight the Nine Li race's arrival.</p>

  <p>Adele glanced at them and asked, "Have the Yellow Emperor members arrived?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they have. They are waiting in the city," the leader of the Wild Gods replied respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Take us there," Adele said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Grand Elder!"</p>

  <p>The leader bowed and led the way with his men, followed by the others of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>As these people flew over the city, they attracted the attention of everyone below. The people of Flying Sickle City knew that something big was about to happen here today.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the city was a wide wasteland where countless broken bones had been buried.</p>

  <p>On this deserted land stood the people of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>"Are the guys of the Nine Li race too afraid to fight?" a strong and tall man from the Yellow Emperor race said in a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I want," said a handsome young man next to him.</p>

  <p>This young man was David. Not long ago, he had given a challenge to the Nine Li race in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower. It had been only three months since then, but David's aura had changed again. Obviously, the Yellow Emperor race had used a lot of resources on him in the past three months.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. If they don't fight, it means that they've given up the Sky South Bone Tower. Do you really think they will do that?" the lady dressed in blue beside David asked with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Casting a glance at the lady in blue, David said indifferently, "Whether they do that or not has nothing to do with you guys. I can deal with them on my own. I don't know what the elders sent you here for!"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>The strong man, the lady in blue, and the other two people all stared at him with rage when they heard this.</p>

  <p>David was notorious in the Yellow Emperor race for his arrogance. He not only behaved that way toward outsiders, but also toward his own tribesmen.</p>
