<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 775 Kill With One Slash </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once inside the celestial tomb, the already attentive team raised its vigilance to the maximum. With everyone's cultivation base being suppressed, the psychological pressure on their minds was already quite heavy. And coupled with the waves of cold wind that were blowing in from the other side of the tunnel, the atmosphere became even more oppressive.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just that. After all, this was the tomb of an immortal cultivator.</p>

  <p>Legends said that a person who chose immortality dared to go against nature. Even though he was long dead now, this tomb had been created by himself. There were sure to be layers upon layers of traps.</p>

  <p>Most of the Cloud Hall disciples who were at the Internal Elixir Realm followed closely behind the elders. Only by doing so could they find a sense of safety and security. Most of the times, martial practitioners weren't afraid of death, but they were afraid of dying without justice.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Morphens, controlling his puppet, had ordered it to stay at the very front. Up till now, they hadn't encountered any traps, and everyone could see that the puppet was exploring the caves in the front and was unharmed.</p>

  <p>But wait! Since that puppet was clearly still fine, why did Imogen just remind everyone to be careful?</p>

  <p>Imogen was a Life and Death Realm expert. Even though her cultivation base was suppressed, she was still much stronger than everyone else. Just as she finished speaking, a black shadow suddenly appeared and hopped towards the puppet Morphens was guiding.</p>

  <p>Among all the elders of Cloud Hall, Morphens' strength was ranked in the top three. He was second only to Imogen and Ning Yudie and easily on par with Emanuel.</p>

  <p>When Morphens had controlled Luo Luo Zheng, he had been able to easily deal with a group of disciples of the Elite House even with his nature level cultivation base. His puppet technique had already reached a rather high level, and under Morphens' control, the puppet was as strong as an Internal Elixir Realm practitioner.</p>

  <p>When attacked by that pitch-black shadow, Morphens reacted extremely quickly. With one command in his mind, a slender and long sword suddenly appeared in the puppet's right hand!</p>

  <p>That wasn't too surprising. Although the puppet, for all intents and purposes, looked exactly like a regular human being, it was still a mere puppet, and the weapon was hidden within its arm without any damage to it.</p>

  <p>Once the thin sword jumped into the puppet's hands, it ruthlessly slashed at the black figure in front of it.</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>The thin sword was comparable to a fairy weapon and sparked as it cut at the black shadow. Somehow, the shadow seemed to be physical and the clang of metals was heard as it collided with the sword.</p>

  <p>Only then did everyone notice what the black shadow was.</p>

  <p>"It's actually a corpse that has been refined for someone's use!" Morphens remarked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The corpse was following someone's orders much like a living being.</p>

  <p>Corpse refining was a sinister and demonic technique, which could turn a dead body into a strong weapon. The stronger the dead person was in his real life, the stronger his refined corpse would be.</p>

  <p>This must have been a significantly strong cultivator, since the corpse was only forced back a few steps by Morphens' puppet. Then, it extended its two pitch-black arms to grab the puppet.</p>

  <p>Morphens wrinkled his eyebrows and ordered the puppet to counterattack, and suddenly two flying knives shot out from the puppet's chest. At the same time, a sharp knife stuck out from its knee, as the puppet raised its leg and dashed toward the corpse.</p>

  <p>Cling ... cling ?</p>

  <p>The corpse's flesh and skin seemed to possess a toughness beyond an extreme level. The two attacks from the puppet had not caused it any harm at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the corpse's hands suddenly moved forward and stabbed into the puppet's chest like two knives. With just a slight tug, the puppet was torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>After it tore the puppet apart like paper, the corpse charged towards the people of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Corpses did not have any intelligence. For them, all creatures that invaded their territory were enemies and were supposed to be killed.</p>

  <p>Imogen and Ning Yudie did not move. Emanuel, who was usually the most silent among the lot, suddenly sneered and took a step forward. A long spear appeared out of the blue in his hand and rushed towards the corpse's head.</p>

  <p>The weapon was surrounded by numerous electric arcs. As it thrust out, it looked like an electric dragon, aimed at the corpse's head, fast like a mighty wave and accurate like an arrow.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The corpse's head exploded from the impact!</p>

  <p>In terms of attack power, Emanuel was even stronger than Morphens, so he was only second to Imogen and Ning Yudie in Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The headless corpse swayed twice, and then its stiff body fell to the ground with a thud.</p>

  <p>But even though Emanuel had killed the corpse in a single shot, the crowd did not relax.</p>

  <p>The way they saw it, refining corpses was a dark and sinister technique, and there were a few second and third grade sects in the Central Region that had the kind of intelligence required for refining corpses.</p>

  <p>Such refined corpses weren't necessarily powerful. An Internal Elixir Realm warrior could kill them easily. However, in this tomb, it had taken the strength of Emanuel to kill the corpse with a spear. If that was how things were, wouldn't the other creatures in Mist's Celestial Tomb be even stronger?</p>

  <p>Once the corpse was defeated, the company continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>Though the road became wider from that point on, the grim atmosphere became denser and denser.</p>

  <p>"There are corpses on both sides!" an elite disciple of Cloud Hall suddenly gasped in a trembling voice. He was an Internal Elixir Realm martial artist, but seeing so many corpses had made even his hair stand on end.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who was following behind the crowd, took a glance on either side of the road. The wide path was flanked by two rows of black iron fences, and inside the fences, there were hundreds of densely packed corpses. Each fencing had at least ten corpses. Luo Luo Zheng estimated that there had to be at least three hundred corpses in all.</p>

  <p>Since the corpses were contained by the fence, they merely extended their black hands, constantly jumping and trying to break through. Seeing the intruders, one by one, they began to stir restlessly. Some continued to let out a sinister and ungodly "heh heh" sound that felt creepy.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. These corpses are trapped inside the fence. They can't get out!" an elder immediately comforted the warriors.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, a few of the elite disciples felt slightly relaxed. The black iron fences seemed to be very strong, and even though the corpses had great strength, they could not tear apart such strong iron.</p>

  <p>However, hardly had they taken a few steps forward when they suddenly heard a crisp noise. The fences on both sides of the path suddenly shrank into the walls simultaneously.</p>

  <p>With the fences gone, the corpses were freed and rushed towards the people of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Imogen snorted and ordered, "Kill them all!" With that, she brandished the walking stick in her hand and rushed towards the corpses with a fierce roar.</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of corpses, but even though the elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm were being suppressed, dealing with such corpses was not a problem for them.</p>

  <p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p>

  <p>Emanuel instantly thrust out his long spear three times, and each thrust was accompanied by a long and narrow flash of white light. Within an instant, three corpses, standing right in front of him, were killed off as their heads exploded like the previous corpse's head.</p>

  <p>Morphens was quick too. Right now, he was wearing a set of coppery gloves in his hands, and every time he took a step forward, his figure would float behind a corpse, and crush its head with his fist!</p>

  <p>Morphens was the most proficient in Mystical Pace, but there was no need to use it right now. The corpses could be killed without that too.</p>

  <p>The elders continued to destroy the corpses in front of them, but the Internal Elixir Realm disciples of Cloud Hall were in a miserable state.</p>

  <p>With the strange and depressing Mu Ning floating around in the cave, their strength had fallen down. They had been demoted by one complete level and were now only equal to an Illuminating Soul Realm cultivator.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" A disciple of Cloud Hall drew his sword and encouraged the warrior beside him.</p>

  <p>The other disciple nodded in approval. Then, he too drew his sword and together, the two moved forward.</p>

  <p>Clank, clank ?</p>

  <p>The corpses seemed to be completely invulnerable. The disciples could not cause any damages, and all that was left for them to do was flee for their lives.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, six Cloud Hall elders had come inside the tomb with them, so even though these elders were busy killing the corpses, there was still a chance for the disciples to survive if the elders protected them.</p>

  <p>And they did! Seeing that the disciples could not resist the corpses, two elders came to their rescue and kept them behind their backs to protect them.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Suddenly, a disciple of Cloud Hall shouted to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One of the corpses was sneakily rushing towards him from behind his back.</p>

  <p>The disciples had seen how strong the corpses were. If they could tear the puppet apart with one stroke, then they would easily be able to kill Luo Luo Zheng too.</p>

  <p>Hearing the shout, Luo Luo Zheng turned around immediately and saw a corpse with bared fangs in front of him. Corpses had to go through a lot of procedures during refining, which was why their bodies turned black. The corpse's face was ferocious, its fangs were exposed, and it was about to pounce on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One of the elders in charge of protecting the Cloud Hall disciples rushed over, planning to take care of the corpse. He was very clear on Luo Zheng's position in Cloud Hall and he could not let anything happen to him.</p>

  <p>However, before the elder could even make his move, Luo Luo Zheng flipped his wrist, and the long sword in his hand was raised horizontally. The tip of the sword trembled with enormous power, and the sword slashed toward the corpse under the force of five hundred dragon scales in his body.</p>

  <p>"Flick the sword."</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With one slash, the corpse's head was broken into confetti.</p>

  <p>Other than Emanuel and Morphens, no one else had been powerful enough to do that; not even an elder like Fernandez. The elder who had come to help Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>The disciples at the level of Internal Elixir Realm were also shocked.</p>
