  <p>In the fairy place, Augustus looked at Luo Zheng from head to toe as if he was sizing up a stranger.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng understood the full meaning of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, his Soul of Light had suddenly been enhanced. Moreover, he learned that the Sea of Truth was a place for cultivation which could greatly improve his soul up to a higher level.</p>

  <p>After he left the Sea of Truth, Luo Zheng's temperament had also changed.</p>

  <p>His eyes retained their sharpness, but his features looked very natural now.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you finally came out, Luo Zheng!" Augustus uttered as he came closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's wrong?" Startled, Luo Zheng could not help but ask as he wondered if anything big happened during his training.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I just wanted to know if the Sea of Truth is interesting at all. So, is it?" Augustus grinned and asked.</p>

  <p>But as a response, Luo Zheng only gave him a glare before walking straight towards the middle hall of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the middle hall, Mike was looking up at the ceiling with his hands clasped behind his back, showing a touch of sadness that drifted across his face.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there was a noise near the door. Mike turned his head to see what it was and saw his son standing at the door. Upon his seeing his son, the sadness in his face instantly vanished. "Luo Zheng, you've come out!</p>

  <p>Congratulations! You have mastered the complete Truth of Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Back in his less stressful days, Mike also thought about the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>However, his cultivation progress was a tad bit slower than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, Holy Beings didn't exist, but he had lived countless times longer than Luo Zheng. Experiencing more things than Luo Zheng, he had a broader vision, which gave him an advantage over Luo Zheng with regards to the comprehension of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>Of course, if Mike wanted to enter the Sea of Truth, he also needed some opportunities.</p>

  <p>Somehow, even though the sadness on his face only lasted for a second, Luo Zheng keenly captured it. "Father, what happened? What choice did the Moon Clan make?"</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes, Mike answered, "Word came from the Floating Islands that the Moon Clan had already left there."</p>

  <p>"What? They have moved out of the Floating Island?" Upon hearing his response, Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>To which Mike replied by nodding his head.</p>

  <p>Although the Luo Clan had no members in the Time Sea, it still wasn't too difficult to plant some informers in the area so that they could easily get and harvest news from there.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, The Moon Clan was regarded as one of the most powerful and ancient clans in the Time Sea that it had been on the top three for countless years in a row.</p>

  <p>But just a few days ago, the Moon Clan abandoned the Floating Island that they had been running for many years, causing all of their members on the island to retreat and relocate.</p>

  <p>The news had shocked all of the constituents of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Thus, the clans that ranked first and third had both left the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>All the people of the Moon Clan had returned to the Hidden Tree.</p>

  <p>"It only means that they've chosen us," Luo Zheng said monotonously.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a trace of meaningful light seemed to flash across Mike's eyes as he said, "They didn't choose us. They just chose not to give in."</p>

  <p>Anyhow, it was impossible for the Moon Clan to compete with the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>All this time, Mike didn't tell them the existence of the people of the Other Shore Realm outside the divine land, pressuring the Moon Clan into making such a choice.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel didn't have it easy for making a clan that had been powerful for many years and the Holy Beings to submit.</p>

  <p>"This should be good news for us," Luo Zheng said, blinking his eyes. "But why were you so worried a while ago?"</p>

  <p>Sighing, Mike replied, "The Sword Clan told us that Harper was killed."</p>

  <p>"Master Harper was killed?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Mike's news, Luo Zheng could not help but freeze in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Harper was a very important person to the divine land. Back then, he was the reason why Luo Zheng was able to change the direction of this ship of the divine land, avoiding the crash.</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he heard the news.</p>

  <p>He had only met Harper once, but the latter gave him the Shadow Bearing Sword as a gift. Refined by Nicholas's Furnace of Dark and Light, the sword became a part of his mother's body.</p>

  <p>"Back then, Harper performed the Mixed Element Seal to shut those Yellow Emperor Guards. As a result, the guards hated him to the core. And as soon as the guards freed themselves and broke the Mixed Element Seal, they all went to kill him. In fact, Harper posed no threat to them anymore," Mike said in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>After being cursed, Harper turned into a skeleton and was unable to escape the deep well at all.</p>

  <p>He might still have some hope to come back to life if the time came that the divine land returned to the Source World. But unfortunately, that day did not come, and he was left for dead.</p>

  <p>"So, how is the Sword Clan now?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Just like the Moon Clan, the Sword Clan was faced with a similar fate as well.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Clan also intends to withdraw from the Floating Island. I expect they will soon move all of their elites to the Everest Spirit Mountain," Mike responded.</p>

  <p>"But is the Everest Spirit Mountain able to resist the Yellow Emperor Guards?" Luo Zheng asked as he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Bitterly smiling, Mike replied, "This is also what I am worried about. The Everest Spirit Mountain is not the only one experiencing the problem, but also the Swirl Forest and the Immortal Mansion. Harold has already gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain as he wants to form a space channel. If one of the forbidden areas is attacked by the Yellow Emperor Guards, then they could be transferred to another forbidden area through the space channel."</p>

  <p>Just like how the outer wall of the divine land rejected outsiders, it would most probably be the same for the forbidden areas. This meant that the Yellow Emperor Guards would not be able to step into the forbidden areas normally, through the usual methods.</p>

  <p>However, if these Yellow Emperor Guards were able to break through the outer wall of the divine land, then they might certainly be able to break through to the forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Mike had prepared a few things. "Are you confident enough to cross the Sea of Truth?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Although Mike had never been to the Sea of Truth, Lorena had given him a rough description of what the place looked like so that he could picture it in his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I can't make it in a short time," Luo Zheng answered as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>The first line in the Sea of Truth alone had put him under great pressure, and it was only going to get harder.</p>

  <p>"Even if you really set foot on the Other Shore, it would still be difficult for you to fight against the Yellow Emperor Guards. There's no need to worry about this," Mike said with a smile. "But now, I have to personally take you out."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" Curious, Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking you to the divine land to integrate all the other Divine Dao," uttered Mike.</p>

  <p>At that point, his greatest ambition was to use the Infinity Ruler to merge the three thousand Divine Dao together.</p>

  <p>Accidentally, Luo Zheng cultivated the Primal Chaos Technique, resulting in the creation of his special inner world.</p>

  <p>He had always believed that Chiyou must have meant something when he gave the Infinity Ruler to Lorena, but the secret of that meaning had never been uncovered.</p>

  <p>Still unsure of his speculation, Mike felt that it was already a necessary step for him to help Luo Zheng fuse the three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had already stepped into the Sea of Truth, he still did not cultivate the Truth of Void Destruction. With his current speed, it was too slow for him to absorb more than two thousand Divine Dao Tablets throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, Mike was a Holy Being, and his Grand Teleportation technique allowed him to cross dozens of big regions at a time, which was a hundred times wider than what Luo Zheng could do. Therefore, Luo Zheng was able to move very fast across the divine land with the help of his father.</p>
