  <p>
</p>

  <p>A look of suspicion came over Elder Celia when she saw how Luo Zheng agreed with them so easily.</p>

  <p>But she was well aware of her son's strength. Among the younger generation of the Nine Li race, save for Romeo, Elsa, and several other powerful warriors, no one was a match for Doran.</p>

  <p>Giacomo didn't agree with Romeo's suggestion? he thought there was no real need to fight Doran.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Zheng agreed so quickly, Giacomo had nothing left to say.</p>

  <p>A vast wasteland lay on the other side of the Cave of Wildness. This temporary battle had immediately attracted the attention of many.</p>

  <p>"Alas! Alas! Who is Doran fighting?" a woman with bangs asked curiously.</p>

  <p>She definitely had yet to hit twenty years old and had a beautiful face framed by perfectly neat bangs. Her bright eyes stared at Luo Zheng who wasn't standing too far away.</p>

  <p>"Elsa, you came out too?" Romeo took a glance at her.</p>

  <p>Elsa was at the top of the mid-rank Wild Gods in the Nine Li race. While her blood wasn't all that pure, it had undergone some special change, making it very rare.</p>

  <p>"I heard a ruckus from outside. Who is that young man? I've never seen him before," Elsa commented.</p>

  <p>Romeo smiled faintly as he said, "I told you about him a few days ago.</p>

  <p>That's Luo Zheng? he saved my life."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's him! How interesting. According to what you said, he is quite a magical one. Doesn't Doran have to lose this time?" she asked further.</p>

  <p>"I guess so. We can't really know until the results later," Romeo answered with a shrug.</p>

  <p>Under the crowd's gaze, Doran uttered the word 'grow', making his body expand rapidly.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had transformed into a giant that stood over ten thousand feet tall. Then, he said in a loud voice, "It's your turn, little guy!"</p>

  <p>In Doran's eyes, Luo Zheng only had a fraction of the Wild God Power. Even if he activated it, he could only grow up to about a thousand feet tall? he was still the "little guy" before Doran.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no intention to fight seriously, as he did not want to waste his time dealing with Doran.</p>

  <p>"There's no need. To deal with you, I don't need to activate this Wild God Power..."</p>

  <p>As he stood on the ground, Luo Zheng looked up and gazed upon Doran who stood as tall as a mountain.</p>

  <p>"Really? Just have a try..."</p>

  <p>With a sneer, Doran reached out to hit Luo Zheng. Give his size, killing Luo Zheng was all too easy.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng stood still as his eyes lit up, and a powerful soul pressure then spread out.</p>

  <p>Elder Celia focused her attention on Luo Zheng all the while. Seeing how calm he was, she wondered if he had any powerful backup or special trump card.</p>

  <p>Never did she think that Luo Zheng would erupt with such a powerful flashing force.</p>

  <p>Before Doran could land a hit on Luo Zheng, he suddenly felt like a hammer had hit his head. His face turned pale in an instant.</p>

  <p>And then Doran fell to his knees with a heavy thud.</p>

  <p>"You..." Doran roared, grinding his teeth as he dashed right at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the moment he took action, his brain trembled once again. The violent vibrations of the soul made him dizzy and light-headed.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>This time, he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>As he lay on the ground, Doran still struggled to push himself back up.</p>

  <p>But his body began shaking once again and he fell straight to the ground, unable to move, before passing out completely.</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>The scene made Elsa burst into laughter. She asked Romeo, "Are you sure this is a battle? What a big gap!"</p>

  <p>Romeo only shrugged and said, "As far as I'm concerned, the two of them are by no means equal in strength. I believe Doran would only bring himself disgrace."</p>

  <p>The True Gods of the divine land made a sneak attack using the soul force, but never did they rely on it completely. If the opponent had a soul defensive weapon, using the soul attack would be in vain, after all.</p>

  <p>But the souls of the Wild Gods in this world were truly weak.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could kill the Wild Gods on his level without so much as a scruple.</p>

  <p>Wild Gods such as Doran could hardly resist such an attack.</p>

  <p>"Is it okay now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked as he slowly walked over, staring at Elder Celia.</p>

  <p>"It so happens that you have a very powerful soul force. But you've relied on this one method to defeat your opponent, which doesn't seem very fair," Elder Celia explained with a complicated look on her face.</p>

  <p>Doran did not have the chance nor the strength to even defend himself, let alone fight back.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Luo Zheng asked in return, "Are you saying that I cannot take advantage of my method in battle?"</p>

  <p>Elder Celia was known to be a brave and chivalrous character. After a moment of thought, she said, "My son is not as powerful nor skillful enough to fight you. He should hand over his spot in the Cave of Wildness to you."</p>

  <p>"If you had known that from the start, they didn't even need to fight,"</p>

  <p>Giacomo chimed in, curling his lips.</p>

  <p>The wall of the Cave of Wildness was covered with fine bone textures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently stroked the surface as he said, "These bone textures are produced naturally on the bones of the Chaos Ancient God. It's rather strange that they can actually transfer the Wild God Power..."</p>

  <p>Only a small space lay at the bottom of the cave? only a single person could fit. After entering it, Luo Zheng could feel a strong aura of Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>It flowed along the bone textures and gradually made its way, gathering around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"How strong and dense!"</p>

  <p>Above the cave were ten people continuously refining the wild bones, sending pure Wild God Power into the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>They were responsible for extracting the power of the wild bones and they were particularly skilled at it? they could extract ten times faster than Luo Zheng could.</p>

  <p>It came as quite a surprise to Luo Zheng? the Wild God Power seemed to be alive, forming turbulences that gathered in Luo Zheng's body as they infiltrated and pervaded it.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power filled every inch of his bones, flesh, and hair.</p>

  <p>Six days later...</p>

  <p>Baldwin asked, "Elder Giacomo, Luo Zheng has absorbed nearly two million wild bones. Must he really continue?"</p>

  <p>Such an amount was already absurdly great for a low-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>If other warriors absorbed twenty or thirty thousand pieces of wild bones, a sign of Body Tribulations would sure to come. But Luo Zheng merely continued absorbing the Wild God Power as though his body was a bottomless pit.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" Giacomo smiled cunningly.</p>

  <p>When the old man said that he would offer Luo Zheng ten shares of blood wild bones, he was worried that it would be too much for the boy. But now, it was made clear that his worries were totally unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The guy's physical condition was insanely good.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Giacomo said, Baldwin held no scruples any longer. Since Luo Zheng obviously had such a great appetite, Baldwin simply asked several more people to extract the power of wild bones for him.</p>

  <p>Once again, a tremendous amount of wild bones were poured into the Cave of Wildness for Luo Zheng to absorb.</p>

  <p>But after another six days, Luo Zheng had managed to absorb another two million more wild bones, showing no intention to stop in the slightest.</p>

  <p>By now, Giacomo had grown a little impatient. Wild bones were nothing to the Nine Li race, but it was till surprising to them that Luo Zheng's absorption was rather excessive.</p>
