<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1150 Scavenging Through Garbage </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>These level eleven beasts really were so much more powerful than Luo Zheng had imagined. He was fortunate enough because with his high speed, he was able to get rid of the purple mineral-devouring bugs. Jumping away, he fell straight into the ring of light at the bottom of the tree. The moment his feet touched the ring, he was worried that the bugs would chase after him and exit the pyramid in their pursuit. If they really managed to come out of the pyramid, how were the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors going to fight against them?</p>

  <p>Thankfully, the bugs were unable to catch up to Luo Zheng, and when they discovered that there were a few other humans digging on the tree, they surged towards them like a tornado.</p>

  <p>Callan was completely immersed in mining in the 27th layer when he suddenly heard loud noises. He raised his head and his expression immediately changed.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what the hell are those things?" He blankly stared at those large purple-colored bugs which were rushing down rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhh! Help! Help me!" Not too far away from Callan, a divine-level talent was caught by a purple mineral-devouring bug and was immediately tossed into the air.</p>

  <p>When warriors left the leaves, they were pulled downwards by a massive gravitational pull even stronger than the Earth's. However, a single purple mineral-devouring bug was able to completely cancel out that gravitational pull and throw a warrior into the air. One could imagine just how powerful the creature was!</p>

  <p>"Help me!" Other than instinctively calling for help, the warrior wasn't left with much to do. The bug was simply too powerful.</p>

  <p>After the warrior was thrown into the air, the other bugs immediately surrounded him. They stretched out their slender feet and began to tear him apart.</p>

  <p>Mineral-devouring bugs only ate ores to survive and weren't concerned about human flesh. This meant that by tearing their prey apart, they were simply torturing him in a cruel streak of fun.</p>

  <p>How could the body of a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior withstand the tearing attacks of several level eleven beasts? The warrior's screams and cries for help came to an abrupt stop after only a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Immediately after being grabbed, he was torn into pieces, and the bloody confetti from his corpse fell towards the bottom of the tree.</p>

  <p>When the other warriors, including Callan, saw this, their faces turned pale instantly. After witnessing such a dangerous event, even a fool would know that he had to run for his life. Everyone jumped off and dashed towards the bottom of the tree.</p>

  <p>Outside the pyramid, the vast majority of warriors weren't even aware that such a fatal change had occurred. Most of them were still busy trading their ores or bargaining with Camilla.</p>

  <p>The number of supreme life vitality crystals that she had gathered had already reached around 70, 000!</p>

  <p>Such a number of supreme life vitality crystals was enormous, even for a crown prince of a divine kingdom, who would consider this a large amount of money. In each of the four divine kingdoms' national treasuries, normally about 200, 000 to 300, 000 supreme life vitality crystals were stored. But in just about nine hours, Camilla had already earned around 70, 000 supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>However, her face did not seem to register that fortune. If it had been the days of the past, then after earning so many supreme life vitality crystals, Camilla would have been overjoyed. Even if she was only able to draw out a commission, it would still be a massive sum of money for her!</p>

  <p>However, she was depressed that she couldn't help Luo Zheng get enough life stones. From the looks of it, the amount of life stones that she had gathered was far lower than his expectations. However, the mine could only produce so many life stones a year. There was nothing that Luo Zheng, or indeed Camilla herself could do about it.</p>

  <p>Just as she was discussing the price of a piece of Black Frost with a divine-level talent, a loud sound suddenly rang out.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even before the effects of the blue-colored ring on the side of the pyramid had completely dissipated, a huge crater appeared below it.</p>

  <p>When the dust settled, they saw that Luo Zheng was lying in it.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's wrong with you, Tianxing? What happened?" Camilla blinked her eyes as she stared at the young man who seemed to be completely unharmed despite the huge crater he had just made.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had used his fastest speed to get rid of the purple mineral-devouring bugs. However, he was unable to stop his body in mid-air after charging out at such a speed. Therefore, on falling, he had created a large crater on the ground.</p>

  <p>Of course, with Zheng's sacred weapon's physique, he wasn't injured at all.</p>

  <p>He only felt his blood churn from this impact.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched in surprised curiosity as Luo Zheng climbed out of the huge crater. Soon after, countless rings of light began to flash above Zheng's head. The next moment, bloody chunks of flesh fell from the densely packed rings of light like rain.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng turned his head and saw this scene, a look of helplessness appeared on his face. After this bloody scene, the densely packed rings of light continued to flicker without end, and pale-faced divine-level talents began to emerge from the rings of light. They all seemed to be in a hurry and some even looked scared and angry.</p>

  <p>Only a small number of those divine-level talents managed to stand up.</p>

  <p>Most of them directly threw their bodies at the crater. They didn't have a body as tough as Zheng's and each and every one of them had fallen heavily.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The pyramid isn't supposed to be that dangerous. Why is every single one of them running for their lives?"</p>

  <p>"Did they encounter mineral-devouring bugs? Did the purple mineral-devouring bugs come down?"</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents who had been trading ores outside began a flurry of discussion. Some of them had already guessed the truth.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo!" A prince of the Star Field Divine Kingdom crawled out from the crater. His face was pale and there was even a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth. However, he looked furious as he angrily roared at Luo Zheng, "You were the one who lured those purple mineral-devouring bugs down to the lower layers!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the prince speak, the divine-level talents outside the pyramid immediately understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>It was difficult even for the divine-level talents to deal with green mineral-devouring bugs. Only the most powerful warriors like Luo Zheng, Fredric, and the others who were ranked in the first tier of the Divine Kingdom Continent dared to provoke them. However, Luo Zheng was the only one who could kill a green mineral-devouring bug. Even Fredric and the others weren't strong enough.</p>

  <p>Purple mineral-devouring bugs were several times more powerful than green ones. Even Life and Death Realm warriors themselves didn't dare to try and fight them, let alone Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The habits of these mineral-devouring bugs were very regular. The green mineral-devouring bugs usually did not go below the 30th layer, and the purple ones usually did not venture below the 40th layer. However, just now, everyone had personally witnessed Luo Zheng entered the 40th layer. That was why they believed that it was Luo Zheng who had offended those purple mineral-devouring bugs and in their pursuit, they had come down.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng himself hadn't intended for that to happen. Zheng's expression didn't change at the accusation of the prince. He replied calmly, "I didn't do it on purpose."</p>

  <p>"Well whatever! You've caused the death of a warrior. You think that you can just end it by saying that you didn't do it on purpose?" The prince was still unwilling to accept this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders. He could not have predicted such a situation. Even so, he did not intend to change his decision. He would explore the entire mine until he was able to find enough life stones.</p>

  <p>The prince became even angrier when he saw that Luo Zheng wasn't paying any attention to him. But since he couldn't do anything about it, he could only order, "Guys, stop mining! God knows if those purple mineral-devouring bugs have flown to the upper layers or if they are still waiting for us down below!"</p>

  <p>It was impossible for these divine-level talents to escape the purple mineral-devouring bugs. The chances were that in a blind chase, they could even take a wrong turn and find themselves at a dead end after which, they were finished.</p>

  <p>"Alas! There's no other way. Let's go scavenge through garbage. Maybe we'll be able to find something useful in there. Not that I have much hope!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not mining either. I'm going to scavenge through garbage too!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Let's go. It's better than throwing our lives away here!"</p>

  <p>A lot of warriors were filled with righteous indignation when they heard this. They walked around the pyramid in groups of three or five and headed in another direction.</p>

  <p>Only then did Randy walk over with a wry smile. "Tianxing, did you really lure the purple mineral-devouring bugs down just now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. There was nothing he could do except admit to what he had done.</p>

  <p>"How many?" Randy didn't care about the life or death of the other warriors. Moreover, the warrior who had just died wasn't from the Harlen Divine Kingdom which meant that he cared even less. The death of that divine-level talent could only be considered as his own bad luck.</p>

  <p>"I think there were five," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Randy was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been able to lure five purple mineral-devouring bugs at once.</p>

  <p>The most surprising thing was that this fellow was able to escape unharmed. For a while, Randy didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>"I advise you not to enter the pyramid again, Tianxing. The 40th layer is too dangerous. If you get surrounded by five or six purple mineral-devouring bugs, then I'm afraid you won't be able to escape either!" Randy advised.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head slightly without any hint of hesitation on his face. No matter how dangerous it was inside the pyramid, he simply had to go in!</p>

  <p>Randy also knew that Luo Zheng was stubborn. He couldn't persuade him, so he said nothing more.</p>

  <p>"Why were they talking about scavenging through garbage? What were they talking about?" Luo Zheng asked Randy before he ventured inside again.</p>

  <p>"Scavenging through garbage?" Randy smiled. "They are going to scavenge through the trash of this place to find some weapons which were not cursed. Perhaps they'll do so in the abandoned arsenal. This place is known as the Feather Emperor Secret Land. It was originally a mine belonging to the Dragon Lineage Human. There were numerous weapon refiners of the Dragon Lineage Human who once came to this island to refine weapons. Among them, the most famous one is the Feather Emperor."</p>
