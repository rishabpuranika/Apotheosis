<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3686 The Fake Eastern Emperor Taiyi </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as Pearce jumped upwards. His hand shook violently, and the back of his palm up to his arm burst into cracks.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Blood gushed from the cracks and spread out until it turned into a handful of blood mist.</p>

  <p>He gently brushed the blood mist in his hand, and then a long sword condensed from the mist.</p>

  <p>"God-detaining Sword!"</p>

  <p>The moment he pulled out his sword, the area around him shook again, and another handful of blood mist bloomed. He stretched out his hand, and a second sword was condensed from the blood mist.</p>

  <p>"Diabolic Sword!"</p>

  <p>"Crane Sword!"</p>

  <p>More blood mist spurted out from his arm and condensed another long sword. Afterwards, more than ten long swords floated beside him.</p>

  <p>"Unite!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Pearce uttered the word, all the swords piled up to form one sword and the aura of the sword became stronger.</p>

  <p>"Demon-annihilating Hand!"</p>

  <p>Just then, he brought out another Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was a black ghost hand with jagged skin and sharp nails.</p>

  <p>The black ghost hand quickly replaced Pearce's original hand and fitted itself over his forearm like a glove.</p>

  <p>Then, he grabbed the sword and disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In the next second, he appeared behind Emperor Di Jun. He wasted no time and immediately swung his long sword, slashing towards Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>As a descending type of Other Shore Token, the ghost hand had also released many Jun of power.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the sword strike was especially forceful because Pearce forged his sword with the blood essence.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the sword slashed down, the corners of Emperor Di Jun's mouth curved slightly. Suddenly, he grabbed one of the ghost hand's fingers, lifted it, and sent Pearce rolling in the air.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Pearce flew up high in the sky, and then landed on the ground not far away from Luo Zheng with a heavy thud.</p>

  <p>He had consumed too much of his blood essence already. He almost collapsed after he fell, but there wasn't much blood that flowed from his wound. His face was even as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>'I... I've tried my best...'</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind.</p>

  <p>If there was still anything he could do to change the situation, that would be burning the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>However, burning the Other Shore Token was a taboo for many people in this world. Even if he didn't do so, he thought that Eastern Emperor Taiyi might not blame him.</p>

  <p>Just as he lay on the ground waiting for Emperor Di Jun to kill him, his gaze turned to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed into slits, and he quickly became shocked.</p>

  <p>He saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi open his eyes and stand up...</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was awake?</p>

  <p>When he looked more closely at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Di Jun who was in the sky looked down at the ground.</p>

  <p>He was amazed and confused at the same time.</p>

  <p>How did that happen?</p>

  <p>"Someone is possessing Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell..." he thought.</p>

  <p>That was the first thought that came to his mind.</p>

  <p>Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi was trapped on the Other Shore, it was impossible for him to return!</p>

  <p>After he came to a realization, his confusion and astonishment turned to anger.</p>

  <p>He and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a close relationship in the past. Even if he wanted to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he would not allow anyone to take Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. Moreover, it was an act of humiliation to Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you?" asked Emperor Di Jun in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked up at Emperor Di Jun in the sky, his face full of confidence. "I am Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the master of the Starry Sword Region!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Once again, Emperor Di Jun was stunned.</p>

  <p>Based on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's expression, he didn't look like he lied, but what did he mean by the master of the Starry Sword Region?</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was a little shocked. It would be the best if he could frighten away Emperor Di Jun by taking advantage of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's own title.</p>

  <p>Why did he say that he was the master of the Starry Sword Region, which confused everyone?</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng didn't know that Eastern Emperor Taiyi was trembling with excitement after he had obtained the physical body.</p>

  <p>He had never seen the chaos for many years...</p>

  <p>He had been there over a thousand chaotic eras ago...</p>

  <p>And today, he got the same chance again. He wasn't afraid of fighting at all.</p>

  <p>In fact, he wanted to battle.</p>

  <p>If Emperor Di Jun really ran away, he would be very upset.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Emperor Di Jun's face darkened. He was already sure that someone had taken Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. Anyway, he wouldn't even have a meaningless argument with Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>With a pinch of his hand, the blue cube began to shrink.</p>

  <p>As the blue cube shrank, it was enough to crush the people inside into meat paste.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes narrowed into slits as he looked at the shrinking space with a smile.</p>

  <p>He stretched out two fingers and gently scratched the space.</p>

  <p>"Swish..."</p>

  <p>When the two scratch marks appeared on the space, the space exploded.</p>

  <p>"It is the perfect space construction method. However, such a small trick cannot be used to trap me. Ha-ha!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said as he kicked the ground lightly and flew up.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Emperor Di Jun became even more confused.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew his space token very well.</p>

  <p>In the air, Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked around. The current world was completely different from the 77th chaos. The 77th chaos was filled with the starry regions of various sizes, but this space right now was a vast and boundless land!</p>

  <p>He tore his gaze off his surroundings and held the Purple Rainbow Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The Purple Rainbow Sword shook slightly, and a melodious sound filled the air. It turned out that Eastern Emperor Taiyi made a series of strange sounds with the sword.</p>

  <p>The sound was melodious and pleasant at first, but as it became louder and louder, it suddenly made people feel irritable.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He wanted to see what the fake Eastern Emperor Taiyi was up to, so he listened carefully.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly stretched out his finger and flicked the Purple Rainbow Sword.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>When the sound turned harsh, Emperor Di Jun felt as if his heart exploded.</p>

  <p>Then, he was in a trance.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi swiftly took advantage of this opportunity. He raised his sword and stabbed Emperor Di Jun!</p>

  <p>By the time Emperor Di Jun had regained consciousness, the tip of the sword had almost reached his chest. However, his expression changed. He barely dodged the stab, turned into countless blue squares and quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun appeared not far away and stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi with his cold eyes. "Where did you learn the small trick?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In turn, Eastern Emperor Taiyi held the Purple Rainbow Sword and said with a faint smile, "Someone almost died due to such a small trick..."</p>

  <p>Now, not only Emperor Di Jun but also Pearce who lay motionless on the ground, Auden, and the others, understood that this person was not the Eastern Emperor Taiyi they knew!</p>

  <p>After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi regarded himself as a decent swordsman after he had founded the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He was honest and upright in his ways. He would never cultivate such a skill.</p>

  <p>As for how this person had easily possessed Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell, they couldn't understand either.</p>

  <p>Still, Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't care about the others' stares at all.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for him to attain his freedom. Besides, he just wanted to apply what he had deduced for so many years, especially because the Other Shore's environment was still very different from the chaos.</p>
