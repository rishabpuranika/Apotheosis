  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Murphy had continuously fired out many complicated spells, the black sword that he held in his hand flashed once.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a black crystal shield had been formed before Murphy's body.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The shield had intercepted the huge fire fist that had been rapidly rushing towards Murphy. After a few moments, the crystal shield shattered and disappeared after it had merged with the fire.</p>

  <p>The crystal shield had somehow reduced the flames' power, and the huge fire fist immediately shrunk to about a tenth of its original size.</p>

  <p>Murphy had kept casting his spells with a dire expression on his face. After the first crystal shield had disappeared, the black sword in his hand flashed again, and instantly, another black crystal shield materialized in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The second crystal shield had been smashed to pieces immediately as soon as it was formed.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened to the third, fourth, fifth...</p>

  <p>The crystal shields hadn't been able to withstand the impact of the fire fist at all, but at least they had been able to shrink the fire fist bit by bit every time they intercepted it.</p>

  <p>Murphy had to condense these crystal shields; otherwise, he was the one who took damage.</p>

  <p>His body wouldn't have been able to survive the impact if he had been directly hit by the fire fist. The only thing he had been able to do was give his full force in an attempt to put out the flames.</p>

  <p>As the Spirit Annihilating Sword's power was used in such a way, it sapped a great deal of Murphy's energy.</p>

  <p>More black crystal shields were released continuously, and the strain of this effort was evident on Murphy's face which had turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>When he was near his power's limit, he bit the tip of his tongue and spat a mouthful of blood essence onto the Spirit Annihilating Sword.</p>

  <p>A dark aura briefly surrounded the surface of the Spirit Annihilating Sword.</p>

  <p>Murphy then hurled the sword downwards.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The flames had been finally thoroughly extinguished.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in place of the fire fist, there appeared a giant golden fist that steadily grew at an alarming rate.</p>

  <p>Murphy caught sight of it and his eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?"</p>

  <p>All of the consummate True Gods, including Rachelle, had also been taken aback.</p>

  <p>The power of the fiery red lotuses had been known to all of them. If Holy Beings had fallen into them, they would be reduced to dust in an instant regardless of how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>Most people thought that Zheng had already died when he fell into the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>They had been blown out of their minds when he had appeared in such a manner.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Murphy retreated as fast as he was able to.</p>

  <p>However, there had been very little distance between him and Zheng. After Zheng had activated the Wild God Body, his corporeal body had grown up to 50, 000 to 60, 000 feet.</p>

  <p>Murphy had done his best to retreat and stay out of Zheng's way but he still had not been able to dodge Zheng's mountain-like giant fist.</p>

  <p>The moment that Murphy collided with Zheng's huge fist, a brilliant golden light shone from the surface of the fist.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The collision had produced a crisp reverberating sound, similar to that of a huge gong. A torrent of powerful energy forcibly flowed into his body.</p>

  <p>It had been Murphy's instinctive reaction to remove this domineering force, but as soon as it had entered his body, it turned into multitudes of little snakes that wreaked havoc in his body. There had been no possible way to remove it.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't been able to remove this force, it would have torn him apart.</p>

  <p>In Murphy's desperation, the solution he had thought of was to lure the malicious force into his own inner world.</p>

  <p>If it were Demi-holy Beings or consummate True Gods who had attempted to do this, it would have been an act of suicide. But Murphy's universe had attached itself to the divine land, and thus it was able to withstand the force.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A huge explosion had opened a gap on the top of the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>A golden ray of light transformed into a gleaming sword as it soared down from the skies. It traveled through space over hundreds of millions of miles in a flash. It crumbled the stars along the way into dust and then finally pierced a supreme world in the universe.</p>

  <p>The supreme world had been cut into two halves before it began to implode.</p>

  <p>It still wasn't enough to dissipate the power of the domineering force. In the presence of this force, other nearby supreme worlds also collapsed one by one.</p>

  <p>An infinite number of creatures had perished. The fake Sacred race that had invaded the Evolutionary Universe had suffered the greatest losses.</p>

  <p>Even though a significant amount of the domineering force's power had already been dispersed into his own universe, Murphy's condition had not been improved.</p>

  <p>His hair was ruffled and untidy, and cracks had appeared all over his body.</p>

  <p>He was in despair, and his breathing had become rapid and weak.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Truth of Godly Way? Why? The Truth of Godly Way is from that guy's body. How is that possible?" Nicholas, even though he had been standing quite a distance away, wasn't able to hide the shocked expression on his face.</p>

  <p>He had extensive knowledge of how the Truth of Godly Way worked, which served as the base to reach the Other Shore. Most of the Truths of Godly Ways depended on the cinnabar fields to help the souls reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's Truth of Godly Way originated from his body, which defied everything in Nicholas' previous experiences. If he hadn't witnessed it with his own two eyes, it would have been impossible for him to believe it.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng thought that there was something different within him.</p>

  <p>He retracted his fist and looked closely at his hands, scrutinizing the smallest details.</p>

  <p>He had noticed a few significant improvements in his body after it had been refined by the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>When he had activated his power, a halo of faint golden light radiated from his fist.</p>

  <p>"Is this also a Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng had mused to himself as he looked wonderingly at the golden light.</p>

  <p>It required the forging of a Truth Boat with the Truth of Godly Way if one wanted to reach the Other Shore. Zheng, on the other hand, had been crossing the Sea of Truth using only his physical body, so the Truth of Godly Way had been completely integrated into his body.</p>

  <p>It was definitely not the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>"Of course." Zheng heard No. 9527's voice come from his chest. "You wouldn't have dared to dip your feet into the Sea of Truth if you hadn't already comprehended the Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"Is it the Ancient God Cultivation Method that produces this kind of Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Over eons, the ancient gods had also only relied on their physical bodies to cross the Sea of Truth. There was a great probability that they had the same kind of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"You may say so, but it's not exactly right." After a bit of hesitation, No. 9527 continued, "The ancient gods learned the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. When the Wild Gods had cultivated to the maximum level, they were able to master the Truth of Powerful Holy Body, cross the Sea of Truth, and set their feet upon the Other Shore. Unfortunately, this method hasn't been effective recently. You now possess a unique Truth of Godly Way, different from the ancient gods."</p>

  <p>Since there had been no way to learn the Truth of Powerful Holy Body, and even the Ancient God Cultivation Method had been of no use, it was eventually replaced by the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had achieved the refinement for turning his body into a weapon, he seemed to have triggered an alternative way for body refining. With the assistance of the Ancient God Cultivation Method, he had been able to open up a new path that bypassed the third truth which had been applied to the whole chaos.</p>

  <p>After Zheng consulted No. 9527 briefly, he stared at Murphy nearby and told him, "In the universe back then, you launched a sword attack on me. If it were not for Estelle, I would have died. Now, I reciprocated your sword attack with this punch!"</p>

  <p>With a gargantuan body, Zheng's voice had been quite loud. It spread through the expanse of space, and everyone heard it as though it was thunder.</p>

  <p>Murphy floated quietly in the open space. Compared to Zheng's gigantic body, it was as if he was only as small as an ant even though he was a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>He was badly hurt both physically and mentally.</p>
