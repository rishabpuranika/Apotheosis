<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 288 Kite Skydeck (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While sitting up straight in the room, cross-legged, he eyed the Sun Moon Stars Picture before him with the utmost attention.</p>

  <p>These past few days, he had not been to the Lake of the Magical Fish, as his points were just not enough.</p>

  <p>It was during his journey to the south when he collected most of his points.</p>

  <p>After he killed the blade locusts and acquired the crystal core from the queen blade locust, the points he had obtained became the envy of all the outer disciples of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Indeed, thousands of points was a huge number for any outer disciple. It did not cost him much if he only used them for some healing drugs and vitality cultivation elixir, which could help him in the practice.</p>

  <p>Even when he went to the Heavenly Library once, it only took him a hundred points.</p>

  <p>However, if an inner disciple used these points for practice, they could last for ten days or half a month at most.</p>

  <p>If truth be told, Cloud Sect's points and rewards system was actually more than practical.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to go to the certain places where he could practice and improve his strength rapidly, he had to help the Cloud Sect accomplish many tasks. Then, the points they obtained from the tasks could be used in practice again.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he had hoped to earn millions of points in a short time.</p>

  <p>However, after enduring many things, he now realized how na?ve he had been. The reality was, he did not only have to earn points, but he also had to use them to do other things. If things were to carry on at such a slow speed, collecting millions of points was going to be impossible.</p>

  <p>Besides obtaining the points through accomplishing tasks, there was another way, which was to buy points with cubic crystals. Usually, two cubic crystals could buy one point.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng had around twenty thousand cubic crystals. If he decided to bargain them for points, he could receive ten thousand Cloud Sect points.</p>

  <p>Even though ten thousand points sounded like it was a lot, that particular amount would not last long if used for practice in the Lake of the Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>With the rise of the depth in which Luo Luo Zheng had leaped into the lake, the time it took would also accordingly increase.</p>

  <p>It took two hundred points for two hours of practice in the Lake of the Magical Fish. If he had to practice for four hours each day, then he had to pay four hundred points on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>That meant that ten thousand points would only last him for less than a month.</p>

  <p>Other than the cubic crystals, Luo Luo Zheng also had over six hundred drops of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>From the spiritual weapons he had acquired, he extracted over a thousand drops of heavenly essence. Nevertheless, he had not used all the heavenly essence in the dragon sculpture; he had over six hundred drops left with him.</p>

  <p>In the past, fifty drops of heavenly essence with unknown sources were traded for as high as 120 thousand cubic crystals at the Blessed Auction House.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if his heavenly essence could be sold at that price as well, then he could gain over one million cubic crystals at the auction.</p>

  <p>However, the law of supply and demand controlled the commodities' prices.</p>

  <p>Heavenly essence was a good thing, and it was a precious treasure without a doubt, particularly for those weapon refiners. Normally, finding and getting them only occurred with a bit of luck.</p>

  <p>If six hundred drops of heavenly essence appeared in the market all of a sudden, the price could decrease due to the high amount of supply. In that case, the rate of fifty drops could not be 120 thousand cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Luo Zheng had the black fire that could help him gain more heavenly essence whenever he wanted. On the other hand, it was impossible to bargain so much at once.</p>

  <p>'I will sell fifty drops in a bottle one at a time, ' Luo Luo Zheng decided after a bit of contemplation. Simultaneously, he wanted to entrust the heavenly essence to Wurth who could sell it.</p>

  <p>For a long time, not knowing whom to entrust them with troubled him before. On top of that, he was also unsure whether to disguise himself if he ever handed over the heavenly essence to someone.</p>

  <p>It became clear over time to ask Wurth to sell them for him, as it was possible that the man would only assume that Luo Luo Zheng got them by chance.</p>

  <p>Although, asking Wurth for the second or third time was surely going to raise suspicions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew the saying 'An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth' all too well.</p>

  <p>If anyone discovered that he had the ability to create heavenly essence, he could get into a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>Although a lot of misfortune seemed to surround him already, he still hoped to attract less trouble as possible.</p>

  <p>Other than Wurth, however, Luo Luo Zheng could not think of anyone else whom he could trust with such a delicate favor.</p>

  <p>'Wurth and I are good friends, ' he thought. 'It is a good thing he is helping me sell the heavenly essence. His family is very rich, so I assume that he would not take advantage or do any harm to me.' As the saying went, 'Love your neighbor, yet do not lower your defenses.' At the end of the day, it did not hurt Luo Luo Zheng to be cautious.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came up with a good excuse, he left and headed for Wurth's residence. When he reached his destination though, he could not find the man anywhere.</p>

  <p>After asking someone around the house, he found out Wurth was not in his room, and that he had gone to the Drizzle side peak to practice.</p>

  <p>Without wasting another moment, Luo Luo Zheng went to the side peak to look for him.</p>

  <p>Among the many side peaks of Drizzle Peak, intensive training became the central purpose for several of them.</p>

  <p>Although these side peaks paled in comparison to the guarded cultivation places in Cloud Sect, at the very least, these practice spots were free to the disciples of the Drizzle Peak.</p>
