<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, entering the Hall of Causality could be risky for any warrior.</p>

  <p>For those vying to be on the top 50 like Hailey and Janet, they would rather choose to rob other warriors of their Illusion Points instead of risking their lives in the Hall of Causality. They could also lose the chance of being part of the top 50 if they died in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>But as for Luo Luo Zheng, even if he did die in the Hall of Causality and lost half of his Illusion Points, he wouldn't fall off the top 50 in this current stage.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if he did succeed, he could copy the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>It was a risk worth taking.</p>

  <p>'But will anyone still be willing to enter the Hall of Causality?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself. When he checked the iron ticket in his hand, he was filled with hope.</p>

  <p>The iron ticket showed Luo Luo Zheng that there were already nine warriors gathered in the Hall of Causality, and there was only one slot left to open the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>These nine warriors were some of the low-ranking warriors who weren't willing to give up just yet.</p>

  <p>However, with their current accumulated Illusion Points, they still would not be able to make it to the top 50. In that case, they had nothing to lose in risking their five million Illusion Points in the Hall of Causality in exchange for more.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to lose the one slot to the Hall of Causality, so he immediately paid five million Illusion Points. This was a chance he didn't want to miss. And so it began.</p>

  <p>With all the changes that had happened in the Illusion Battlefield, time seemed to pass by very quickly.</p>

  <p>Just like that, six days had already gone by.</p>

  <p>During these past six days, the intense battle in the Illusion Battlefield gradually came to an end.</p>

  <p>Each warrior was accompanied by an invisible hand called "strength."</p>

  <p>This invisible hand was responsible for distributing the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>When mighty warriors would go ransacking, their Illusion Points would be driven by strength, and these Illusion Points would be combined into those of the stronger warriors.</p>

  <p>The warriors with less Illusion Points would be deemed "penniless" and lose their share in the loot.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng had just returned from the Hall of Causality through a door of light. In his hand was the Saint Killing Spear, but this time, it already had a small imprint on it.</p>

  <p>His second visit to the Hall of Causality was also his second attempt into the Corridor of Emperor. This time, however, Luo Luo Zheng did not encounter Supreme Lord Sword, but had faced other True Gods instead. And from this recent visit to the Hall of Causality, Luo Luo Zheng had gained 40 million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>With the 40 million Illusion Points he had gained this time, he still hadn't bested the one who was ranked in the first place in this supreme world.</p>

  <p>He was still ranked second.</p>

  <p>So who ranked the first? Luo Luo Zheng was dying to know who was better than him. But with the hundreds of millions of warriors in this supreme world alone, there was no easy way to find out.</p>

  <p>'I wonder how Xun will react once she sees the Saint Killing Spear,</p>

  <p>' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he proudly stared at the imprint on the Saint Killing Spear. The two tender sprouts on the spear had grown longer and began to intertwine with each other.</p>

  <p>Not long after Luo Luo Zheng had returned from the Hall of Causality, the mysterious young lady's voice sounded once again.</p>

  <p>"Attention, warriors! The second stage of the Illusion Battlefield has commenced. All warriors who made it to the top 50 rankings of each supreme world, please move now!"</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield looked up at the sky when the announcement started. They fell silent and listened carefully.</p>

  <p>After the announcement, a loud wail of disappointment echoed from afar.</p>

  <p>It was from a warrior who fell one rank short of the top 50. He was desperate to know how far he had gone and how many more Illusion Points he still needed to progress in the top 50. But even if he found out, it was already too late.</p>

  <p>Another warrior was celebrating. He had already lost hope when the first stage was about to end. But because of luck, he had killed a warrior and obtained millions of Illusion Points. And so, at the eleventh hour of the first stage, he made it to the top 50.</p>

  <p>There were 2, 500 warriors in total from the fifty supreme worlds that made it to the second stage of the Illusion Battlefield competition.</p>

  <p>Having made it to the second stage, these warriors were now considered as the best in the whole universe. Some of them were innately powerful, while others were merely lucky.</p>

  <p>Among these qualified warriors, Mu Ning was probably the happiest, yet the most anxious one.</p>

  <p>She was happy because she was finally able to leave this supreme world and find Luo Luo Zheng somewhere else. She was even closer to him. She was worried that he wouldn't be able to enter the top 50 of a supreme world.</p>

  <p>That way, she wouldn't even have the chance to see him.</p>

  <p>Amidst her mixed emotions, a golden door of light appeared before her.</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened in astonishment and with a gentle smile on her face, she stepped into the door.</p>

  <p>The same golden door of light appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng too. 'This is it!</p>

  <p>The second stage begins! I can't wait to meet the people behind this door.</p>

  <p>They must be the strongest warriors in the 50 supreme worlds! They are probably the most outstanding talents in the entire universe, too!' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>With this thought in mind, Luo Luo Zheng felt extremely excited for the second stage and entered the door of light. He looked forward to the adventures that would await him in the second stage. Whatever was behind the golden door of light, surprises or dangers or both, he would face them all.</p>
