  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng left, Calum turned to a servant and said, "Fetch me the Dragon Path Array Plate."</p>

  <p>The servant gave a short bow, went into the palace, and returned with an unadorned array plate in hand.</p>

  <p>The road from here to the mountain peak was named the Dragon Path and had existed ever since work on the palace had completed.</p>

  <p>This ancient path was covered by many major arrays that intended to protect the path by taking lives of intruders.</p>

  <p>Sword arrays like the Hacking Sword Array and the Fallen Sword Array provided fundamental protection for the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Calum wasn't high-ranked enough to have his hands on all those sword arrays.</p>

  <p>The array plate he was holding controlled the Cloudy Mountain Array that was built to test climbers trying to scale the mountain.</p>

  <p>For a while at the beginning, the palace didn't build the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Anyone wanting to join the palace had to go straight up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Every day, there were countless people climbing the mountain. Hundreds and thousands of them would fail the Cloudy Mountain Array.</p>

  <p>Once the Dragon City was built, it became difficult even to become qualified to climb the mountain.</p>

  <p>"This person is at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm. The eighth-class difficulty will do," said Calum.</p>

  <p>"The eighth class?" Sellers was surprised.</p>

  <p>Calum glanced at Sellers and asked, "What's wrong? You're afraid it's too difficult for him?"</p>

  <p>The array plate Calum was holding could adjust the difficulty of the Cloudy Mountain Array. The eighth class was the easiest of the lot.</p>

  <p>It was suitable for Luo Zheng's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Sellers chuckled and said, "If you set it at the eighth class, we might witness a new record today."</p>

  <p>Calum thought for a while and said, "If you think so highly of him, I'll set it at the seventh class."</p>

  <p>Sellers didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>It was no big deal for Luo Zheng to walk the Dragon Path. It was just one way to get him up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Sellers was thinking to himself that even though Luo Zheng was only at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, he could easily handle a fifth or even a fourth-class Cloudy Mountain Array. The seventh or eighth class wouldn't even slow him down.</p>

  <p>Sellers turned out to be right.</p>

  <p>After Calum activated the array plate, the Dragon Path started glowing and emitting light.</p>

  <p>The path ahead looked like a curled-up dragon, zigzagging right up to the mountain top.</p>

  <p>"For someone at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, the current record for the seventh-class difficulty is twelve hours. I have activated the array,"</p>

  <p>Calum said, looking puzzled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng should have slowed down drastically the moment the array was activated.</p>

  <p>But it looked like the array wasn't affecting Luo Zheng one bit. He was ascending even faster!</p>

  <p>"Is he actually speeding up?" Calum turned to ask Sellers. Sellers laughed and said, "Yes!"</p>

  <p>Calum was astonished. He wondered if the array was broken.</p>

  <p>But the Cloudy Mountain Array was designed by the higher-ups from the palace and had been working perfectly for several years now. How could it be broken?</p>

  <p>Besides, the array plate was working just fine.</p>

  <p>"At this rate, four hours will be enough for him to reach the top," Sellers said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," Calum said, shaking his head. "He is fast now, but he may not last long. I think he's using some secret method to boost himself."</p>

  <p>However, an hour later, Calum became restless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't slowing down. On the contrary, it looked like he was gaining speed.</p>

  <p>If he kept accelerating at this rate, he would finish the whole path in three hours.</p>

  <p>"Let's set it at the sixth class." Calum upped the difficulty level using the array plate.</p>

  <p>For someone at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, a sixth-class difficulty was quite ambitious.</p>

  <p>Once Calum leveled up the difficulty, he saw Luo Zheng slow down for an instant.</p>

  <p>But it only took him about ten seconds to recover and continue ascending at a mind-numbing speed.</p>

  <p>Calum looked confused. He grabbed the array plate and shook it, as if to see if it was indeed broken.</p>

  <p>"Sellers, my friend! Who is this guy?" He finally understood why Sellers was so confident about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've seen the Sword Card. It was from Master Qiu Yinhe," replied Sellers.</p>

  <p>Calum shook his head in disbelief. He had lived in the Cloudy Mountain Palace for long and he was finally coming to understand that Luo Zheng was no regular guy. "If that's the case, we should make it even harder."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he raised the difficulty to the fifth class.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng acquainted himself with the fifth-class difficulty pretty easily after a short adjustment period in which he slowed down for a bit. .</p>

  <p>Calum watched Luo Zheng's figure on the array plate, speechless.</p>

  <p>Was it suggesting that the change in the levels of difficulty made no difference to Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>"I'm going to challenge the young man with a fourth-class difficulty now. If he fails, I'll report it accordingly and send him up the mountain myself," said Calum.</p>

  <p>It was beyond his understanding. Shaking his head, he turned up the difficulty to the fourth class.</p>

  <p>He was surprised yet again, his expression freezing as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>Calum's reaction amused Sellers but he tried not to laugh.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, he was wearing a mask, his expressions guarded from everyone.</p>

  <p>He had known that Luo Zheng would be surprisingly fast.</p>

  <p>Calum then adjusted the array to the third class without uttering a word.</p>

  <p>The third class was supposed to be really difficult, especially for a young man at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Milo had also been at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm when he had challenged the Dragon Path.</p>

  <p>Back then, the members of the Heart Flow Sect had made Calum set the difficulty at the third class for Milo, and then turn it up to the second class.</p>

  <p>Milo had still made it to the mountain top.</p>

  <p>But Milo was a talent with Instant Enlightenment and the palace regarded him as a treasure.</p>

  <p>A talent like Milo didn't have to be tested by the Dragon Path. The Heart Flow Sect had sent him here for fun and he had, in the process, set the highest record of all time.</p>

  <p>Would Calum compare Luo Zheng with Milo? That was impossible!</p>

  <p>The third-class difficulty did slow Luo Zheng down.</p>

  <p>He had ascended so fast because he had ignored the swords coming towards him.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't get hurt no matter how the flying swords came after him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had, by now, covered two-thirds of the path. The flying swords were gaining power now. He had to spare some strength to destroy them, and also occasionally dodge them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng came up with an idea so that he could ascend even faster.</p>

  <p>His arms turned black underneath the sleeves. He held his arms up to protect his head, and sped up once again.</p>

  <p>The flying swords were like raindrops, and the force contained within was several times stronger than that of the swords in Sword Tower. But they only numbed Luo Zheng's arms, without leaving a mark.</p>

  <p>"Has he sped up again?" Calum exclaimed, his eyes wide in astonishment.</p>

  <p>This wasn't what he had expected to see.</p>

  <p>Even Sellers was surprised now.</p>

  <p>He had always thought that there was quite a huge gap between Luo Zheng and Milo, but it now looked like the gap had diminished greatly.</p>
