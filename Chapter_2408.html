  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't bother to talk to him.</p>

  <p>However, the low-rank True God remained persistent. He even ran in front of Luo Zheng just to stand in his way. He wouldn't let Luo Zheng go as long as he didn't purchase anything.</p>

  <p>It was forbidden to fight in the Non-combat Zone, so people here didn't worry that others might make a move when they were angered.</p>

  <p>To take advantage of the said rule, this low-rank True God pestered passers-by at the gate of the divine city and made good profit out of it.</p>

  <p>Although many True Gods who came by to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao prepared their own Sanskrit words themselves, there were always some True Gods who would be tricked by him.</p>

  <p>"Don't miss this opportunity! Once you master and comprehend this Sanskrit word, you will be able to make a splash in this debate over the Divine Dao!" The low-rank True God walked alongside him, observing Luo Zheng's unreadable expression. He then took out another pile of paper and said, "If you are not interested in those Sanskrit words, how about these?</p>

  <p>These are purple-gold Sanskrit words, so rare and so useful. The price would be a divine might coin for one word. Actually, it's already a losing business at such a price... "</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard purple-gold Sanskrit words, he felt a little bit uneasy.</p>

  <p>He shifted his gaze at the paper, not knowing if he should laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the so-called purple-gold Sanskrit words were pieces made by coating a layer of purple-gold powder on the common Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The True Gods entering the city burst out laughing when they saw the purple-golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't faze the pestering low-rank True God at all. He was determined!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to stop in his tracks. He looked at the True God indifferently, and then took a golden Sanskrit word in his hand, saying,</p>

  <p>"This Sanskrit word is very simple to decode. The meaning it conveys can be summarized into roughly forty six words. Generally, it describes a plant in the chaos. The fruit of the plant is very sweet, and it can quench people's thirst after taking it."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he stuffed the golden Sanskrit word back into the hands of the low-rank True God, and then he snatched a purple gold Sanskrit word from the low-rank True God. "This Sanskrit word is so laughable. I think it might just be a poem of a certain race... These two Sanskrit words are meaningless. Now can you please leave me be?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, the low-rank True God was shocked and very much hurt. The other True Gods were also skeptical about what he had just explained so carefully.</p>

  <p>Even simple Sanskrit words would not be that easy to decode.</p>

  <p>There were probably thousands of interpretations of this one Sanskrit word in the divine land. But because the deconstruction of a certain Sanskrit word was completely different than the rest, and there wasn't really a lasting consensus on it. Many True Gods had their own interpretations.</p>

  <p>As for the powerful warriors of the divine land, their eyes were sharper and their interpretations were more accurate. However, this was never to be shared among the ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng confidently explained the meaning of the two Sanskrit words, and as he spoke so confidently, this drew people's attention. People began to listen in, wondering what he was saying.</p>

  <p>However, most of the True Gods felt that what Luo Zheng said was only something he had made up randomly.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Just then, an old man in white who stood on top of the city wall, frowned as he stared at Luo Zheng with a particular sharpness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This boy's explanation seems to be very in line with the understanding of Master Loren!" He jolted in surprise.</p>

  <p>Beside the old man in white was a young man with a dignified bearing.</p>

  <p>"I remember that Master Loren has interpreted that Sanskrit word." He explained, "According to his theory, the Sanskrit word indeed talks about a tree, but Master Loren only said that there was a magical fruit on the tree and he didn't mention what this fruit could be used for. Then here comes this random guy, saying that the fruit could quench thirst?"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the many True Gods, extraordinary creatures were above them, beyond whatever they knew. How could they feel thirsty?</p>

  <p>"As we heard, the first half of his explanation is the same with Master Loren's interpretation," the old man said. "And the second Sanskrit word, as he mentioned, was a poem. I remember that Master Loren said it was a cultivation method of some sort."</p>

  <p>The young man chuckled. "Yes, it's true," he acknowledged. "Because of Master Loren's words, many people worked hard to study it, trying to comprehend some token, but in the end, they ended up with nothing. I kind of agree with this guy. Maybe it's just a meaningless poem, but everyone still takes it as a treasure." He tried to process what was happening. "I'll find an opportunity to know him."</p>

  <p>"Let's wait," the old man shook his head. "If we acquaint ourselves with him too early, we won't be able to see his true strength. If he really has some abilities, he is bound to stand out. It's not late to get in touch with him then."</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng had forced his son to decode a lot of Sanskrit words in the Immortal Mansion. He knew what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>The two Sanskrit words in the hands of the young man were the most inconspicuous kind. However, in order to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao, Luo Zheng had memorized many Sanskrit texts.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Luo Zheng was a bit confused.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, who was from the great world, knew and understood very little of the universes or the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was typically difficult for a Holy Being to comprehend the meaning of these Sanskrit words, but for some reason, it was like second nature to Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>For a time, Luo Zheng wanted to release a wisp of his spiritual sense to enter Luo Nian's mind. Luo Zheng believed that there were valuable secrets hidden in Luo Nian's soul that he wanted to explore.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Nian would rather die than be probed by Luo Zheng. One time, he even ran crying to Yudie, claiming that his father wanted to invade his privacy. Luo Zheng took this as a sign to step back and let his son be.</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian drooped his head, Luo Zheng noticed a trace of cunning looks in Luo Nian's eyes. He felt absolutely positive that there were things his son had been keeping from him.</p>

  <p>Hence, the low-rank True God was baffled by Luo Zheng's explanation.</p>

  <p>Grasping the two Sanskrit words in his hand, he stared at Luo Zheng and said blankly, "You..." He pointed at Luo Zheng. "Is it true what you were saying?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes and walked towards the gate.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who were at the gate lined up in an orderly fashion and presented their Sanskrit words to the guards one by one.</p>

  <p>Eventually, it became Luo Zheng's turn. With a slight shake of his finger, a piece of emerald green paper appeared in his hand. There was a faint Sanskrit word engraved on the paper, which emanated a faint aura to show its privilege and specialty.</p>

  <p>"It's an original!"</p>

  <p>"Look, this guy actually has an original Sanskrit word!"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the guards and the True Gods around lit up when they saw the glowing piece of paper in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>There were countless Sanskrit words circulating in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After a Sanskrit word came out, it led to a boom of production as millions or tens of millions copies were made, circulated, and consumed.</p>

  <p>But usually, there would only be one original out of the millions and millions.</p>

  <p>There were even some Sanskrit words that only had copies left in this world.</p>

  <p>Most True Gods might have never seen an authentic Sanskrit word in their lives, but Luo Zheng had one just in the palm of his hands.</p>

  <p>The authentic Sanskrit words referred to the originals. Some of the Sanskrit words were engraved on the stone tablets, some were engraved on the walls, and some occasionally appeared in the air, too.</p>

  <p>There also existed Sanskrit words that appeared on some special places.</p>

  <p>For example, the "Grand Weapon Refining Method" Luo Zheng had been practicing was engraved directly on his body...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made it a point to properly prepare since he had come to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao. This Sanskrit word was not particularly important, unlike what everyone was thinking. He had not expected that a Sanskrit word he had casually taken out would attract such astonishing gazes of the crowd. But for some reason, the place became silent and everyone's eyes were tightly fixed on the emerald green paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>When the low-rank True God who had previously peddled Sanskrit words to Luo Zheng saw the original in Luo Zheng's hand, his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>On the city wall, the two True Gods, namely the old man and the young man, were dumbfounded as well. How could this be?</p>

  <p>"This guy... Where did he come from? How could he have an original?" questioned the young man, still in deep thought.</p>

  <p>The old man in white had a complex expression on his face. Back then, he had tried every means to gain approval of Master Loren to have a look at an original Sanskrit word, but Master Loren had been very careful about doing so. He only allowed him to take a glance for a few seconds, then never again.</p>

  <p>Whoever had an original Sanskrit word would probably keep it in secret and tuck it away somewhere safe.</p>

  <p>A copy might be the work that had been modified on the basis of the original, while the original was the most accurate. This was another factor why the originals were deemed very precious.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng take it out as if it were nothing important, the young man was very curious. At the same time, he wondered if Luo Zheng could possibly have a lot more than that one piece in his hand.</p>
