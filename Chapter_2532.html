<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The night had passed and Zheng had finished refining all the 77 wild bones.</p>

  <p>With his Flawless Divine Body, he could absorb all the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>He was even three times more efficient than Zelda was.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power spread all over his body, directly increasing his strength.</p>

  <p>The next morning, Zheng left the thatched hut earlier than usual. Using only a slight thought, he activated the Wild God Power within his body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, his body expanded.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he grew up from only eight feet tall to thirty feet.</p>

  <p>He was far inferior to Zelda and the young man he killed in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Zheng realized that by refining the wild bones, his strength greatly increased.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, he looked below— the thatched hut went up only to his knees.</p>

  <p>"The Wild God Power… It is very powerful indeed!"</p>

  <p>Excitement filled his eyes. This new body-refining skill was highly suitable for his body.</p>

  <p>If he could absorb just enough Wild God Power to expand his body up to a thousand feet high, just how powerful would he become?</p>

  <p>Zheng had long anticipated the arrival of this day.</p>

  <p>'It's only been a few days, but he's reached such a high level. What a talented man!'</p>

  <p>From the entrance of the hut, Zelda observed Zheng carefully. Though she had her own plan in mind, she knew she couldn't yet reveal it to Zheng at this point.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was a generous person, it was impossible for him to risk his life for her and Luther's sake unless she could help him significantly. If he was worth trusting, she was considering the possibility of revealing her secret to him.</p>

  <p>All the while, Luther had been reading the scroll Zheng gave him.</p>

  <p>Whenever he encountered problems beyond his understanding, he would consult Zheng, who would then answer him patiently.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't stay within the tribe most of the time. He often visited the Immemorial Wilderness to continue searching for the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Zheng's method of finding the wild bones was truly efficient. All he needed to do was spread his mind before everything within a dozen miles fell unable to escape his eyes. He could easily see the wild bones hidden underground with ease.</p>

  <p>But this luck of his was soon gone.</p>

  <p>Even though the method was highly efficient, the wild bones in the Immemorial Wilderness were limited, especially in such a barren land.</p>

  <p>For each of three consecutive days, Zheng had only obtained eight pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>While eight bones a day was a great enough deal for ordinary folk, for Zheng, it was far too little.</p>

  <p>So Zheng intended to sell the blood wild bone he had found.</p>

  <p>But Zelda urged Zheng to wait more patiently.</p>

  <p>The blood wild bone was very precious. If it was made known to the big forces, they would surely take action and send their people to rob him.</p>

  <p>Instead of selling it right away, she suggested that after those who collected the wild bones arrived at the tribe, Zheng should accompany them to the nearest city to sell.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Zheng spotted three people clad in black flying over. They were all Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the square in the tribe's center before walking toward Zelda's thatched hut.</p>

  <p>"Iron Tribe, how many wild bones have you collected this month?" one of them called out, his voice spreading throughout the tribe.</p>

  <p>For generations, members of the Iron Tribe had depended on wild bone collection as a livelihood. Only wild bones could be used to barter for their necessities.</p>

  <p>Hearing his voice, the young and middle-aged men of the tribe stepped out of their thatched huts and surrounded the group.</p>

  <p>Though the wild bones they had picked up were in Zelda's hands, they normally supervised her. They had to make sure she wasn't hiding any of the wild bones from the tribe.</p>

  <p>Zelda followed suit and stepped out, approaching the man in the lead.</p>

  <p>"Good day, Riley. We've gathered a total of twenty-three pieces this month."</p>

  <p>"Only twenty-three?" Contempt was written all over Riley's face.</p>

  <p>Every single month, they had to visit the damned place to collect the wild bones. The tribes were so poor that they could only ever accumulate up to dozens in a month. It wasn't ever worth it for them to come here.</p>

  <p>"The number of wild bones in this area has been decreasing. Our tribe can't go any deeper into the Immemorial Wilderness. We've already been working as hard as possible," Zelda replied in earnest.</p>

  <p>Another man among the three smiled faintly and said, "Well, Riley, we should probably just let it go. Are you expecting them to be lucky enough to dig out hundreds or even thousands of wild bones in this damned place? That would be impossible! Let's hurry and take the wild bones. We have to hurry back before dark."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Riley snorted. "If you still only have twenty-something wild bones next month, we won't be coming here again. It's a waste of time."</p>

  <p>Zelda could only smile helplessly as she handed the wild bones to Riley.</p>

  <p>Riley pulled out a pouch and threw it to the ground. "There's your remuneration," he coldly said.</p>

  <p>Then, they turned to leave.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zelda suddenly called out, "Riley, hold on."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he looked back with a frown.</p>

  <p>"My friend wants to sell something at your auction house. Can he go with you this time so you can recommend him to the auction house?"</p>

  <p>Zelda asked.</p>

  <p>"Auction?" The request had Riley rather shocked. Normally, only extremely rare items were qualified for the auction. What could possibly be auctioned from this remote place? He couldn't believe they had found anything of real value.</p>

  <p>"And what the hell would he sell?" Riley spat. "I doubt it'll be worth it."</p>

  <p>Zelda pursed her lips in frustration and said, "Sorry, I can't reveal that right now. But could you please just take my friend with you?"</p>

  <p>And she pointed to Zheng, who was standing in front of the hut.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Wolf God's blood wild bone was highly precious.</p>

  <p>If the Wild Gods knew he had a piece of it, they never would've allowed him to even go to the auction house. They'd have killed him and the tribe right then and there just to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>Riley grabbed a quick glance at Zheng. At that point, the latter had absorbed quite an amount of wild bones and could release the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>But he had only cultivated for a rather short time and hadn't yet absorbed enough wild bones in Riley's eyes. So to him, Zheng was nothing more than another weakling. At this point, Riley was growing impatient. "I don't have any time to spare on him!"</p>

  <p>With that, he was ready to leave again.</p>

  <p>But Zelda rushed to him and put three pieces of wild bones into his hand.</p>

  <p>With a smile, she said, "Please accept them, Riley. We would really appreciate your kindness."</p>

  <p>Zheng had found these pieces, so the tribe members said nothing of it.</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared on Riley's face when he examined the bones in his hand. He couldn't think of anything good Zheng would have that Zelda thought was worth bribing him for.</p>

  <p>But it was a good enough bribe. All Riley needed to do was let Zheng tag along and recommend him to the auction house. It was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>With that, he smiled at Zheng. "Hey, kid! You'd better catch up with us!"</p>

  <p>Since Zelda had told him all he needed to know, Zheng merely nodded at Riley indifferently. When the Wild Gods flew into the air, Zheng floated gently, quietly following them close by.</p>
