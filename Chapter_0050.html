  <p>
</p>

  <p>Unknown to Luo Luo Zheng, someone stood straight-faced outside the Bloody Mountain, clenching his fists indignantly.</p>

  <p>Outside the mountain, all the tutors from the Cloud Sect were standing next to a Picture Slab, carefully monitoring the performance of each participant within the Bloody Mountain.</p>

  <p>Because they assigned the disciples based on ability and performance.</p>

  <p>However, according to the rules, disciples who passed the test would be allowed to choose their tutors.</p>

  <p>These tutors?monitored as early and carefully as possible, so that they had a general assessment of the disciples who participated in the blooded test.</p>

  <p>Then they made their decisions. They all wanted to find and draw the talents into their folds.</p>

  <p>Anyone participating in the blooded test received a disciple card. Through the disciple card they carried, the tutors could see where each participant was and what they were doing.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Dylan Fang was expressionless. Although he was the Dragon Peak tutor, he was also a member of the Fang Clan.</p>

  <p>Fang Clan sent four clansmen to participate in the blooded test. And Dylan was instructed to ensure that no matter what happened, those four were to pass the test.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the pass rate of the disciples?from the noble clans?was much higher than any of the disciples that were commoners.</p>

  <p>Among over one thousand lowborn disciples, approximately two hundred might pass the blooded test.</p>

  <p>About one hundred and seventy of the two hundred noble clansmen would pass the test.</p>

  <p>There was always a large gap between the classes because most of the commoners were fearful of the noble clans from birth. They also were fearful of offending the families behind these disciples.</p>

  <p>With such a low pass rate, although there was a larger group of commoners, most of them would just end up being bit part players.</p>

  <p>Before the blooded test started, Dylan?Fang had returned?home once where he patted his chest to make a solemn promise to the whole clan that all four family members would pass the blooded test.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, two of them were just eliminated from the blooded test.</p>

  <p>Just then, two rays of light shot from a spot in the Bloody Mountain, shooting straight into the sky. Those in charge of the blooded test climbed on flying chariots to retrieve the disciples that were eliminated from the blooded test.</p>

  <p>Watching on the Picture Slab, he knew what had just happened. The damn fellow was becoming quite vicious. He made them crash their heads into each other hard. If not for the magic array, they would have died. They were two young members of his family and had bright futures.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! How dare you!" exploded Dylan.</p>

  <p>No common disciple had dared to treat a disciple from a noble clan so rudely in a long time. Generally speaking, if a noble clan child failed the blooded test, it was due to conflicts with another noble group. Sometimes, a noble disciple would fail because he was so cocksure of his talents?that he challenged an unreal beast in the fourth or the fifth layer. But, rarely were noble disciples washed out in the test by some ordinary disciple.</p>

  <p>Dylan wanted to know who this damned commoner was, and make him pay the price for hurting disciples from the Fang Clan. He continually manipulated the Picture Slab, trying to find the young man's information from more than one thousand participants'. And soon enough, he saw?what he wanted. The boy's name was  Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he switched over to see what Luo Luo Zheng was doing, he couldn't see anything.</p>

  <p>The image on the slab became a blurred, snowy screen.</p>

  <p>'Is the signal bad, or, is the Picture Slab broken?' wondered Dylan as he switched to the picture of another disciple, only to find that everything from that view was normal. He could see everyone's except Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>'What's going on there?'</p>

  <p>Dylan wasn't the only one encountering this issue. Other tutors were experiencing the same thing.</p>

  <p>For better research, some tutors constantly switched from one image to another on their Picture Slabs, to observe each candidate. However, when they turned to Luo Zheng's picture, they saw a blurry image.</p>

  <p>They didn't care much about this incident, thinking like Dylan, that there must be a bad connection. They just shook their heads and switched to the next one. As there were a lot of candidates to watch, it wasn't a big deal to miss one or two.</p>

  <p>What none of the thirty-three tutors were aware of was that there was one tutor able to trace?Luo Luo Zheng, and that was Master Su.</p>

  <p>She had noticed what other tutors encountered, seeing heads shake and watching them move on to the next candidate; a mischievous grin spread across Master Su's pretty face. She attended the Picture Slab intently. If anyone was next to her, he would see Luo Luo Zheng on the Picture Slab in front of her, instead of a blurred picture.</p>

  <p>The reason no one could see Luo Zheng's performance but her was that she tampered with Luo Zheng's disciple card when she made an excuse to check his card.</p>

  <p>Only by making sure that no one could watch Luo Zheng's performance would no one pay any attention to him. Luo Luo Zheng should join her peak.</p>

  <p>But, now she worried, 'Did the previous battle catch the attention of others?'</p>

  <p>Master Su sighed nervously. Although others could not trace?Luo Luo Zheng, and could not see Luo Zheng's performance, they were able to perceive signs through other participants.</p>

  <p>She prayed that Luo Luo Zheng got enough crystals to pass the test, and she hoped that Luo Luo Zheng?would not?become involved in any more fights. But, then again, those noble clan children were annoying, and always caused trouble. Master Su couldn't help but curl her lips upward in a sly grin.</p>

  <p>Things didn't always go as master Su expected.</p>
