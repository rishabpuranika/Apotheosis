  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Inside the black hall, the Evil God had received the warning from the sentry.</p>

  <p>"The Source World would be targeted first... That bastard surely is looking down on me, huh?" The Evil God was vexed at the information.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, who was standing next to him, smiled faintly and said, "If I remember it correctly, it was the 300th chaotic era when the twin primitive lands appeared. When the first primitive land was destroyed by the needle, it didn't take long before the second was also destroyed. They might not be destroyed at the same time, but there was no exception in the face of the needle."</p>

  <p>However, they didn't know that the needle of the end could actually be controlled.</p>

  <p>The only reason why the Source World was targeted first was because the downgrader felt that it was much easier to deal with.</p>

  <p>The sentry had released the Illusory Vision many times, which also aroused the vigilance of the downgrader. He found out that there were people in the Source World who could control the power of the Deep Space, but they only relied on the Soul Extreme Form, which was why the downgrader didn't really deem it as a threat.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, his real problem was Zheng, who had already mastered the Heavenly Ring Staff and possessed all the powers of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, it would be difficult for him to deal with Zheng right now.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Duran asked "We need to come up with something very soon."</p>

  <p>The Evil God contemplated for a while before he looked and asked Duran,</p>

  <p>"Your Treacherous Being body should be immortal, right?"</p>

  <p>"Well technically, as long as the coordinates aren't damaged, and there's no presence of the Light of Annihilation, it's impossible to harm or kill the Treacherous Being body," Duran said confidently.</p>

  <p>"I see. Then, how about you help me with something?" the Evil God said as if he already thought of something to overturn the situation.</p>

  <p>"I'm listening. What are you planning?" Duran asked.</p>

  <p>A devilish grin appeared on the face of the Evil God as he said, "Well, I'm just thinking of doing something to startle the downgrader, so he'll realize that he can't just look down upon me."</p>

  <p>As of the moment, the needle was still elongating, like a massive bamboo that was growing like crazy. It wouldn't stop until it crushed its target.</p>

  <p>The needle was extending at an incredible rate, but the distance between it and the Source World was also immense. At its current speed, it would still take about two more days before the needle reached its target.</p>

  <p>At the same time, on the jadeite platform, Zheng also gathered everyone to discuss and prepare the countermeasures.</p>

  <p>There, Geoffrey, Tianming, Kincaid, Hilario, the remaining energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the other human heroes, as well as the avatars of the three Chaos Ancient Gods, assembled upon Zheng's call.</p>

  <p>Although the end of the chaos was almost upon them, they were still able to keep calm and think straight.</p>

  <p>In this round of chaos, they were able to master and acquire power that was far stronger than the needle. With that, it shouldn't be that difficult for them to handle it.</p>

  <p>"Father, the end of the chaos is coming soon. Let me fight!" Geoffrey volunteered with all sincerity.</p>

  <p>Right now, there was an inexplicable power that was surging in his body.</p>

  <p>The power was plain but powerful, and it was actually superior to the current powers of the other Eternal Realm masters and the three Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng recognized Geoffrey's power and fighting spirit, but he said,</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, you will definitely be a great help, but you can't make a move yet."</p>

  <p>"Huh? Why?" Geoffrey was a bit confused. If his father had really recognized his power, wouldn't he be given the chance?</p>

  <p>"It's because the needle is not aimed at us," Zheng replied. "It's actually aimed towards the Source World."</p>

  <p>When everyone heard this, there was an instant expression of relief on their faces. The extreme tension had somehow subsided.</p>

  <p>"Really? Then, it gives us a bit more time."</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see what will happen first."</p>

  <p>"If the needle was aimed at the Source World, then the Evil God would surely suffer."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyebrows slightly twitched, and she butted in, "We can't relax yet! Don't underestimate the Evil God. There's a huge chance that he would be able to deal with the needle. Moreover, with his twisted personality, we don't know what kind of trouble he may cause to us. We'd better be careful."</p>

  <p>Previously, the Evil God expressed an intention to join hands with Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, no one could really trust his words.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess is right. Indeed, we have to be on guard against the Evil God, but we have to remember that we should be more vigilant towards the downgrader. I'm sure that he will make a move once the Source World is already attacked. I'm afraid that we can't just watch idly,"</p>

  <p>Fuxi also expressed his opinion.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was pretty known as a detestable and wicked person, but his destructive power couldn't be compared to the terror that the downgrader could bring.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Evil God couldn't downgrade the world. Though the chances were slim, if he managed to win in the end, he still wouldn't be able to destroy everything according to the will of the Bird Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Zheng listened to everything they had said and nodded. "Right now, we can only wait until the needle arrives at the Source World. Once it's there, we shall act according to the circumstances. If the Evil God would be at a disadvantage, we'll have no choice but to help him."</p>

  <p>Each round of chaos produced a different civilization, and the way they treated the needle also varied.</p>

  <p>Once, there was a civilization that accurately predicted where the needle would come from. Thus, they had set up a big array on the inner wall of the chaos in advance, in an attempt to seal the needle outside of the chaos and eliminate it on its bud. However, their plan still failed in the end.</p>

  <p>Still, some civilizations went all out and set up enchanted barriers to block the growing needle. However, they weren't able to fight off the power of the needle.</p>

  <p>The 77th civilization, which was the human race, settled for a mediocre method. Like most civilizations before them, they guarded the primitive land and only relied on the most powerful Other Shore Tokens to gather their power on a human ancestor. They hoped that a single human would be able to resist the needle, but as expected, it ended in failure.</p>

  <p>After that, over a thousand chaotic eras had passed, and all sorts of strange civilizations had appeared. There were so many ways to resist the needle, but no one managed to succeed.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the creatures in this round of chaos were not prepared at all.</p>

  <p>Even as the needle approached, the three primitive lands that existed didn't take any action to directly prevent it.</p>

  <p>Two days later, the needle already appeared about fifty million miles away from the Source World and was fast approaching.</p>

  <p>"It's here! It's coming!"</p>

  <p>A faint grin appeared on the face of the Evil God acting as a sentry, as he shook the black chains.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the needle was just thirty million miles away from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Another five minutes had elapsed, and the needle was only ten million miles away.</p>

  <p>Five million miles...</p>

  <p>One million miles...</p>

  <p>Five hundred thousand miles...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand miles...</p>

  <p>Finally, at this distance, the sentry could already observe it pretty well.</p>

  <p>The front end of the needle was very thin, as thin as an embroidery needle, but the diameter of the entire needle was actually as huge as the Source World. Therefore, the needle would not necessarily pierce through the Source World, but would rather crush everything in it.</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand miles...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand miles...</p>

  <p>Three thousand miles...</p>

  <p>At this distance, the front end of the needle had almost landed on the surface of the Source World.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are they waiting for?" The sentry stared intently at what was happening.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Aren't they going to do anything?" Zheng murmured to himself, baffled at the strange behavior of the people in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The six pairs of compound eyes of the downgrader also flashed. He couldn't see any movement or reaction in the Source World. "Do they give up resisting and just accept their death? Pathetic," the downgrader said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>However, when the needle was just within a thousand miles, a space fluctuation suddenly occurred in front of it.</p>

  <p>Then, it was Duran who appeared in front of the needle.</p>

  <p>Compared to the point of the needle, Duran almost looked negligible.</p>

  <p>But there was no hint of fear on his face. He just raised his wings and rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The great momentum of the needle caused it to pierce through Duran's body, and instantly came out from his back.</p>

  <p>Duran didn't stop the needle at all. Instead, he was pushed by the needle towards the Source World.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that they were about to hit the Source World, he smiled and shouted, "Now!"</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah! Waah!"</p>

  <p>Strange blaring voices were heard from within his body.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a black hole was released from Duran's body and expanded at an unimaginable speed. In just three seconds, the black hole expanded from the size of a person to the size of the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Then, the needle that was about to hit the Source World, drilled into the huge black hole.</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah! Waah!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, a white hole appeared on the other side of the Source World.</p>

  <p>It also expanded to the size of the Source World, and it faced the Burial Land.</p>
