<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1136 Getting Rid Of The Poison </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Randy and Camilla were also quite shocked. Although they had every confidence in Luo Zheng and knew that he would be able to deal with everything fittingly, they still couldn't figure out how he was able to resist the Dragon Arsenic.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Soul Sea Realm masters could block the arrows which flew at such a slow speed, but at the same time, they were also unwilling to be tainted with the Dragon Arsenic. Other than being a secret poison produced by the Dragon Lineage Human, it was also lethally potent.</p>

  <p>Until now, there were no antidotes or formulas found in the four great divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>How did he make it?</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a sudden scream reverberated in the air. From the sound of it, it was not far from where they were. Soon surprise engulfed them as they realized that there were more and more arrows coming from both sides, so it was getting harder and harder to dodge!</p>

  <p>Taking in the chaotic sight, Luo Zheng didn't have time to explain anything to them, so he decided to urge everyone to rush out of the Slow Arrow Area first.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" he roared. His body was tainted with the Dragon Arsenic, and yet he was still sprinting forward, which startled everyone.</p>

  <p>Visibly, the poison continuously spread over his body. By then, he looked like a blue-colored sculpture. Who would dare touch him?</p>

  <p>The people in front of him all moved aside immediately, making way for him to rush through as they heard him roar some commands.</p>

  <p>"Look at the Dragon Arsenic spreading in his body! Could it be that the poison affected him already?"</p>

  <p>"Damn it. It's as though he's gone insane. This guy is really crazy!"</p>

  <p>"At the very least, he is willing to go all out like this, push the rock and sacrifice his life for everyone else..."</p>

  <p>Those divine-level talents speculated among themselves as they keenly observed Luo Zheng. The Dragon Arsenic was lethal, so why was he still alive and kicking? Nothing gave them an inkling as they guessed that perhaps he might have a secret skill to extend his life for a short time. Once his breath dissipated, he had to die.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Oblivious to Luo Zheng, several warriors who were working together with him in pushing the magnetic stone were wary of him. They cautiously dodged him as he continued hitting the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's full strength, the magnetic stone inched forward until it finally gave way with a loud thud!</p>

  <p>A row of black walls which adorned the edge of the Slow Arrow Area appeared for everyone to see. Within these walls, there were round holes arranged according to the rules. And from these holes, arrows kept shooting out non-stop.</p>

  <p>Soon they realized that there were already three walls in the Slow Arrow Area seeming to cage them in as arrows continued to assault towards them from the front, left and right sides. Only the direction where all they moved in did not have such a wall. "Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang! Boom!"</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng quickly kicked the magnetic stone with such an impact that it was sent flying up to the sky. Then it spiraled down crashing into the wall, superbly blocking some round holes.</p>

  <p>"Go up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted as he leaped up, then stepping on top of the magnetic stone and jumping onto the top of the wall.</p>

  <p>The warriors did not hesitate to do the same thing as he did. They stepped on the magnetic stone and eagerly stood on the wall as well.</p>

  <p>However, they still maintained a certain distance from Luo Zheng. After all, the blue Dragon Arsenic on his body was too frightening.</p>

  <p>A while after, all warriors successfully escaped the Slow Arrow Area unscathed. Callan walked up to Luo Zheng without prejudice and simply said,</p>

  <p>"Thank you for saving my sister!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly and replied, "You're welcome."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fiona blinked her eyes as she stared at the Dragon Arsenic, which was on Zheng's body. She asked, "Tianxing, you... Are you okay?"</p>

  <p>She felt extremely grateful towards Luo Zheng for risking his life to save her.</p>

  <p>However, she absolutely could not accept the fact that he might die because of her.</p>

  <p>Still, with a faint smile, he replied immediately, "The Dragon Arsenic is indeed very strange. It can actually spread ceaselessly. But this poison might not be able to kill me!"</p>

  <p>By this time, Randy, Camilla, and the others also had walked over. They too were worried, but relief washed over them when they heard Zheng's words. They felt more at ease, realizing that after so long, he still looked like he was fine.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked down at his blue hands and frowned slightly. He uttered,</p>

  <p>"However, I have to expel the Dragon Arsenic, before keeping on going ahead along with you!"</p>

  <p>"It's alright, Tianxing. We'll wait for you," Randy spoke, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>Before Callan got a chance to speak, Fiona also expressed, "Then we'll wait for you too!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Fredric glanced at Luo Zheng askew, but there was not the slightest trace of gratitude in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Except for Callan's and Randy's teams, the rest of the warriors who had just passed through the Slow Arrow Area didn't stop. Even though it was Luo Zheng who painstakingly saved all of them, they all believed that he should do it. After all, if he didn't do that, he would also die in the end.</p>

  <p>Sitting on this wall, they could still see countless arrows crisscrossing each other as they flew slowly. These flying arrows all occupied their own orbits, but they didn't collide with each other. It had to be said that the Dragon Lineage Human had put a lot of energy and time into arranging such a Slow Arrow Area.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was musing over about how strange the Dragon Arsenic was. It only spread along the surface of his body and did not even enter the deepest recesses of his body. Seeing a perfect spot, he carefully sat down. All he had to do was to remove the poison flowing around the surface of his skin.</p>

  <p>With great caution, he slowly extracted his life vitality from his belly, and he let it move along his arms. Then he expertly controlled his life vitality in an attempt to fuse it with the poison.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Arsenic started emitting smoke the moment his life vitality and poison fused. Even the smoke was blue in color!</p>

  <p>"Be careful. Get away from me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reminded others, being surprised and shocked.</p>

  <p>Fiona, Callan, Randy, and the rest watched Luo Zheng getting rid of the poison with much caution. Seeing the blue smoke, they all knew that it was toxic and fatal. They all abruptly took their leave and kept a distance of fifty or sixty feet away from him. As for Renzo, he moved along the wall and stayed exaggeratedly over a hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>Seeing what Renzo did, Camilla burst out laughing and teasingly remarked, "There's no need for you to run so far!"</p>

  <p>Renzo's face turned red, and he chuckled for a short while before he walked back.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Dragon Arsenic was powerful. It could even corrode the life vitality. The blue poisonous smoke was inevitably emitted by this poison after corroding the life vitality.</p>

  <p>However, when the Dragon Arsenic gnawed away the life vitality, a portion of it was triumphantly neutralized by Luo Zheng. Seeing this, he kept on drawing out his life vitality, causing blue smoke to rise from his surface incessantly.</p>

  <p>Over thirty seconds later, when about a third of the life vitality in Zheng's body had been used up, the Dragon Arsenic on his body had finally disappeared. And now, his skin color had returned to normal.</p>

  <p>But before he could drag his body up, someone handed him a peach-like stone. Looking at it intently, Luo Zheng was a little stunned, and soon he quickly realized that it was a supreme life vitality crystal. The sculpting technique applied to it was also extremely remarkable. The life vitality crystal looked like a vivid peach-like stone even though its color was different from that of the peach.</p>

  <p>Then he heard Fiona whisper, "You've consumed a great deal of your life vitality. You must replenish it!"</p>

  <p>Taking a supreme life vitality crystal was a common thing. It was not something out of the ordinary. With Zheng's current worth, a supreme life vitality crystal was nothing special for him, let alone these princes and princesses of the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>But he was just surprised that the shape of this supreme life vitality crystal was extremely exquisite after being sculpted.</p>

  <p>After watching closely Zheng's strange expression as he received the peach-like life vitality crystal, Fiona smiled and continued, "It was carved by me when I had nothing to do. Not bad, right?"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently crushed the life vitality crystal and began to absorb the pure life vitality within it. He then nodded and agreed, "Not bad. Not bad indeed..."</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Divine Kingdom Continent normally led easier and more comfortable lives compared to those in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors of the Central Region all lived more leisurely than those who dwelled in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Consequently, warriors from both the Sea God Continent and the Central Region did not get to spend time on their hobbies. They only focused on their cultivation all the time.</p>

  <p>"Alright, let's continue to move forward!" Randy uttered at this moment.</p>

  <p>Now that Callan, Fiona, and their team members stayed behind, Randy was well aware that they intended to form a new team. They all considered and took Luo Zheng as their leader. Fiona might look naive, but her strength might be more powerful than his. Thus in his eyes, it was also a good thing to form a new team.</p>

  <p>"After we pass by the Slow Arrow Area, we will now be heading to the Spirit Beast Area. However, because of the blood sacrifice, all the spirit beasts there have been killed," Randy spoke.</p>

  <p>The blood sacrifice of the Dragon Lineage Human pertained to the sacrifice of the life of the entire clan. In theory, there were no living beings left in the four great secret lands.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that mean there's no more danger?" a divine-level talent, who followed Callan, curiously probed.</p>

  <p>Randy just let out a small smile and replied, "What do you think?"</p>
