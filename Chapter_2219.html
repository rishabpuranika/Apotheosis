<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but raise his eyebrows at the sight of three beautiful women being beaten so miserably in front of him.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the Purple Soul Hall was, according to Mae, supposed to be relaxed but it seemed there was a cruel side to it as well.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon mentioned something about ranking in the bottom three hundred. It seemed to be a mission from the Purple Soul Hall that these three women failed to complete, hence, their punishment.</p>

  <p>After the accorded lashes, Madam Moon then patted her hands gently.</p>

  <p>It was then that a woman from the Dream Pavilion came in with a porcelain plate containing three, blood-red pills.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon snorted at the three women. "Take these Blood Flesh Restoring Pills!"</p>

  <p>These pills were certainly not common. Even if they were quite far away, Luo Zheng could still smell the medicine's strong fragrance. There was no doubt that these pills were refined by a very powerful pill refiner.</p>

  <p>However, despite being presented medication, the three women turned even paler at the sight of the pills.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Zheng asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>"She is really cunning. The Blood Flesh Restoring Pill is terrific for restoring flesh, curing wounds, and improving the overall physical strength of the body. However, it is extremely painful to swallow,"</p>

  <p>Master Evil explained with a laugh. It was a cruel method he had also used to punish disobedient subordinates. He often gave them such kind of medicine as a "reward."</p>

  <p>The three women looked miserable but their wounds were only physical.</p>

  <p>World lords like them would not take long to regenerate and recover from such injury. There was no need for a Blood Flesh Restoring Pill.</p>

  <p>It seemed that these pills were part of Madam Moon's punishment.</p>

  <p>None of the women were willing to take the medicine but, because of the pressure from Madam Moon, they had no choice but to swallow the pills.</p>

  <p>Immediately after swallowing, the three began to tremble violently. A large spray of blood burst from the wound and their faces all contorted in extreme pain!</p>

  <p>Blood on their skin began to condense and gradually formed scabs. A blood cocoon soon wrapped around them and not once did their screams cease. By the time they emerged from their cocoons, their wounds would all be healed.</p>

  <p>These female disciples were young and hadn't trained that hard before coming to the Floating Island. Such cruel punishment most likely made a deep impression on them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched all of this in an indifferent manner.</p>

  <p>He did not approve of Madam Moon's temper but he understood the cruelty of this world after all his trials. The competition on the Floating Island would no doubt be fierce and if he wanted to get the recognition from the Han Clan to get better resources and become stronger then he would need to give it his all.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon once again turned to Luo Zheng. "Tianxing, do you know why they were punished?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I don't know."</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of the Floating Island, everyone who enters, whether the stronger ones at the consummation of True God Realm or the weaker ones such as the proving godly warriors, must have at least three matches with other warriors at the Jade Wall of Legends every month. Anyone who ranks in the bottom 300 must receive the accorded punishment."</p>

  <p>"Matches in the Jade Wall of Legends? What's that?" he asked, not having heard of such thing before.</p>

  <p>"You'll know it soon enough. Everyone, come with me!" After she finished speaking, Madam Moon walked straight past the gate of the Dream Pavilion with all the other female disciples in tow. Everyone cast a glance of evident fear at the three blood cocoons as they passed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips and followed too.</p>

  <p>Madam Mood soon led them through the huge Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Madam Moon was the only one here who had such a bad temper. Along the way, everyone who saw her, whether they were proving godly warriors, low-rank True Gods, or even mid-rank True Gods, all stepped aside to give way to Madam Moon.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil, have you ever heard of Jade Wall of Legends?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I have but I'm not very familiar with it. I think it determines the rankings of the Floating Islands but I can't be too sure. I'm not really that knowledgeable about the details," Master Evil replied.</p>

  <p>"Something that determines the rankings of the Floating Islands?" Zheng's gaze narrowed slightly. "That can't be right. If the Jade Wall of Legends determines the rankings then how can they allow us to participate?</p>

  <p>Aren't the rankings very important to the Floating Islands? It must be a game between Holy Beings. How can proving godly warriors ever be qualified to participate in it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Let's wait and see," Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>Before long...</p>

  <p>Madam Moon led them into the Nameless Hall.</p>

  <p>Upon entering, Luo Zheng immediately caught sight of a tall jade wall in the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>This jade wall was dark green and stood about two-thousand feet high and one-thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>There was no need for Madam Moon to explain this time. Luo Zheng could immediately tell that this was the so-called Jade Wall of Legends, but what exactly was its use? And how could it decide the rankings of the islands?</p>

  <p>Madam Moon walked up towards the wall and held up her dry right hand towards it. A mysterious palm print was then formed upon its surface.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>There was a light buzzing noise that came from the wall.</p>

  <p>A ray of light then slowly rose from the bottom, rising and spreading out until it covered its entirety.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Green light reflected off of Zheng's eyes and he watched as names began to be outlined by the light.</p>

  <p>Names were etched onto the wall in tiny font and were spaced closely. It could be said that millions of names were on the wall and the higher the name, the bigger and more conspicuous.</p>

  <p>At the top, the names were very different. Instead of the minuscule font, they were as tall as a person. Moreover, it seemed that they were carved onto the jade by the persons themselves.</p>

  <p>"Shahn Fang! Walton Tang! Rachelle Mu! My God! They are all first-class warriors in the divine land!" Master Evil exclaimed in Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>In addition to those names mentioned, Luo Zheng also recognized a few other familiar names at the top: Harold Yu, Augustus Yu, and Hallet Jing for instance.</p>

  <p>Those at the top were at the consummation of True God Realm, second only to Holy Beings and most likely to turn into one later on.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that the Jade Wall of Legends is only a list of people's strength?" Luo Zheng asked Master Evil in his mind.</p>

  <p>Master Evil shook his head. "It's not that simple. Look at the dense names at the bottom. Some of them seem to be constantly moving."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked and, as Master Evil had said, some names did move downwards while a few moved up.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that the Jade Wall of Legends has the magical ability to rank everyone automatically on the Floating Islands? That's amazing!" Luo Zheng remarked with the slightest hint of disbelief. One could perhaps measure a creature's cultivation base but their strength was something that could only be proven through actual combat. A high cultivation base did not necessarily equate to more power as Luo Zheng had proven time and again.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible. Not even the Ruling Slate can do that, let alone the Jade Wall of Legends," Master Evil agreed.</p>

  <p>As the two discussed the use of the Jade Wall of Legends, Madam Moon turned around and stared right at the young man. Luo Zheng immediately stiffened under her gaze. "Master said that the genius especially recommended by the Heavenly Han House does not need to be examined by the Purple Soul Hall. She seems to be very confident in you. I doubt that though. I don't know by what means you've used the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way. You still need to prove your strength. If you can't even defeat the weakest opponent, I will tell my master and kick you out of the Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>The aggressive Mu Ning she emanated quickly made Luo Zheng feel helpless. She was definitely an old woman who thought too highly of herself. Luo Zheng looked around and asked, "Where am I going to find my opponent?"</p>
