<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Red dots of light kept shooting back toward the main city.</p>

  <p>Martial artists were being killed constantly with up to half of their Illusion Points being extracted. But after some waiting in the main city, they were resurrected.</p>

  <p>Such a system was an excellent opportunity for them to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Not all warriors had the chance to enter the Illusion Space, after all.</p>

  <p>In reality, only tenth-grade sacred places could establish the Illusion Space in their core practice areas in a supreme world.</p>

  <p>Normally, only the core talents of the sacred places had the right to enter the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>But this Illusion Battlefield was open for the 100, 000 supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>All warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, regardless of origin or talent, could freely enter and fight within.</p>

  <p>Some warriors of the Soul Sea Realm clearly understood the fact that it was simply impossible for them to get a good ranking in the Illusion Battlefield with their strength.</p>

  <p>There were simply too many talents to be found from a hundred thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Inheritors of the small sacred places, descendants that city lords had nurtured with all the resources they could gather, the core talents of the various sacred places, the descendants of the Saint Lords…</p>

  <p>Counting these martial artists alone, they added up to an extremely staggering number. Moreover, there were descendants of numerous world lords, Supreme Lords, even the martial artists that were fated to lead the world of chaos— the stars of this world.</p>

  <p>To compete with such remarkable talents…how difficult would it be for the common warriors to rise up in the Illusion Battlefield?</p>

  <p>After giving up on the idea of achieving a high ranking, some martial artists decided not to be too upset about losing Illusion Points. They would just constantly go to fight outside the city, cultivate their skills, and be revived if they got killed. The process was cyclic, and they managed to gain experience and learning to strengthen their warrior spirit through the repeating life and death trials.</p>

  <p>Above the Mist Palace, a massive pyramid also appeared.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists looked up to it from time to time, checking on the rankings.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's name… is still nowhere to be found," an old man remarked as he respectfully stood beside Yolande. "There are way too many names in the pyramid's lower levels. I can't find his name! But Layla Ai's name already came up...130, 000th in her supreme world, and the 4, 600, 000th in the entire Illusion Battlefield!"</p>

  <p>With Yolande's and the old man's perceptions, they could easily find their targets among the millions of names.</p>

  <p>But after Zheng left the city, he barely got any Illusion Points. Not only had he failed to move up a rank, his rank actually dropped below tens of billions of names.</p>

  <p>Finding Zheng's name among so many people's was no easy task.</p>

  <p>"How strange… what is that guy doing?" Yolande was puzzled.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's strength, even if he didn't manage to make it to the top of the Illusion Battlefield, it should've been easy for him to enter the top five million, at the very least.</p>

  <p>"Keep watching. Report to me immediately if anything happens to the warriors of our Mist Palace," Yolande instructed calmly.</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was the core power of the Humanity Alliance— its warriors were all elites.</p>

  <p>The universe was utterly vast— astonishing geniuses could pop up from any corner at any moment. Yolande wasn't certain about the warriors of the thirteen palaces securing high ranks.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Layla already managed to enter the 130, 000th ranking of the supreme world. With her talent and abilities, Yolanda believed that she wouldn't have any problem entering the top 5000. Her achieving something higher would depend on her performance and strength she had left from then on.</p>

  <p>Within the Illusion Space, countless cities of the fifty supreme worlds were riddled with warriors slaughtering their ways through, almost in a frenzy. Those considered geniuses climbed all the way up the pyramid under the gazes of countless creatures of the 100, 000 supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Twelve hours later, the quiet night fell.</p>

  <p>But in the Illusion Battlefield, the fight continued.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>The evil turtle's shell shattered from Zheng's punch. Following a faint cyan flash, Zheng crushed the body within the shell like it was nothing.</p>

  <p>After the turtle completely disappeared, ten Illusion Points flew toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he traveled through the wilderness, he wasn't able to rack up Illusion Points all that quickly, but he didn't really mind.</p>

  <p>Many powerful masters acted as Zheng did and temporarily left the main cities as they waited for the other warriors to gather more Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Some warriors even dug themselves a hole for a good night's sleep.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng used the opportunity to explore the wilderness, not wanting to waste a second of his time.</p>

  <p>After defeating the turtle, Zheng looked at the rolling mountains in front of him. The chains of mountains stretched far beyond what he could see as if they were endless.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield was massive— it was equal to the area of fifty supreme worlds. Even there were countless main cities in the Illusion Battlefield, Zheng didn't think the distance between these cities would be close.</p>

  <p>'It's about time to head back, ' thought Zheng as he looked into the distance and smiled. Then, he prepared to return to the main city— it was nearly time to reap the harvest.</p>

  <p>But just as Zheng turned his head, he felt a faint energy fluctuation from the northwest.</p>

  <p>With a flash of his eyes, he disappeared from where he stood and ended up at the top of a mountain where the fluctuation was coming from.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the two mountains, a light was constantly spinning from a cave.</p>

  <p>'What is that?' Zheng felt rather surprised.</p>

  <p>This Illusion Battlefield wasn't as simple as Zheng had thought it would be.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, besides obtaining Illusion Points by killing other warriors, there were other ways to gather them.</p>

  <p>Surrounding this light were three, golden-furred mice. They were huge for mice, almost the size of a piglet. Even as they were prostrated, their aura seemed intimidating, and it was emitted from their blood.</p>

  <p>"These must be legendary beasts… the Celestial Mice?" Zheng muttered with a frown.</p>

  <p>The old, legendary beasts were all exceptionally strong. All the mice in front of him were of the eleventh level, their strength comparable to that of the Soul Sea Realm warriors. But because they had the bloodline of legendary beasts, it made them much more troublesome.</p>

  <p>What was there in the cave? Three mice were really guarding it?</p>

  <p>Because of the situation, Zheng's interest in the cave only grew.</p>

  <p>Celestial Mice were top legendary beasts— by nature, they were already extremely aggressive. Their pairs of front teeth were pretty much invincible weapons. To add to that, they were the fastest of the legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>Although the Celestial Mice were by no means easy for Zheng to deal with, he wouldn't give up before exploring the cave.</p>

  <p>He was in the Illusion Battlefield, after all— there was still a chance to make a comeback if he failed. Moreover, it was not impossible that Zheng might defeat them.</p>

  <p>Slowly, he trailed down the mountain.</p>

  <p>The three mice, prostrated on the ground, raised their heads vigilantly.</p>

  <p>Their bean-sized black eyes fixed on Zheng as they made creaking sounds— they seemed to be communicating with each other.</p>

  <p>While Zheng remained calm, he became much more cautious. The Celestial Mice were not to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Zheng approached them.</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet… one hundred and fifty feet…</p>

  <p>Then a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped within that distance, the mice suddenly disappeared from his sight.</p>

  <p>Only three blurry shadows flashed before him when he felt a sharp pain as if something stabbed his body.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the three Celestial Mice appeared, not far away from him.</p>

  <p>They formed a triangular formation and surrounded Zheng, revealing their sharp front teeth. Multicolored lights seemed to radiate from the teeth— that was where their talents lay. Because they also contained a Law of Causality, they could be used as a lethal weapon to kill prey in an instant.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff!</p>

  <p>Then, three streams of blood flowed from Zheng's left shoulder, chest, and leg.</p>

  <p>Their attack was undoubtedly fast.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng cared nothing about the wounds on his body— the speed of the three tiny Celestial Mice already exceeded his imagination and he wasn't foolish enough to chase after them.</p>

  <p>Locking his target onto the shining cave, he started walking toward it.</p>

  <p>Just as he made his move, the three mice disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>The moment they disappeared, Zheng drew out his Thunder Wind Divine Sword. The sword's shadow then appeared, acting as his shield.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, dozens of Nether God Shadows emerged from the tip of the sword, spreading out around Zheng.</p>
