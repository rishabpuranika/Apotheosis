<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3341 An Old Friend </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the toads as their escorts, Mike and the other Holy Beings entered a great crack in the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Inside was a whole other world, dark and wet.</p>

  <p>Big black toads, one thousand-foot-wide beetles, and ten thousand-footlong centipedes crawled along the rock walls.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' faces fell at the sight of their environment. What the hell was that place?</p>

  <p>The men in carapace armor said nothing and merely took the lead.</p>

  <p>After the Holy Beings entered the crack, their escorts scattered and returned to their respective lairs. They did not worry about the Holy Beings escaping, anyway.</p>

  <p>"Mike, what the hell is this place?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that we're done for... We can't get out of this place..."</p>

  <p>Now, even the Holy Beings were afraid of death.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng ruled the divine land, some of the Holy Beings died, and some were reincarnated. A new era had begun in the divine land; its rules were more just.</p>

  <p>The descendants of the large clans all began developing, growing more and more powerful. The last thing they wanted was to perish in this time of the new era.</p>

  <p>"If they really wanted to kill us, they could've done it outside the tombstone. Why did they bother taking us here?" Mike pondered calmly.</p>

  <p>He made sense, but that didn't alleviate their uneasiness in the grim environment.</p>

  <p>After flying over a hundred miles in the crack, they found a wide jungle.</p>

  <p>The trees there stood over ten thousand feet high, which made some of them think that they had arrived at the Swirl Forest. The scenery was similar, but it somehow seemed much darker and more mysterious.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the jungle, Mike and the rest eventually found some normal buildings on a great tree.</p>

  <p>When they entered a building, those dressed in carapace armor asked them to wait there.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, a man stepped into the building.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Ramzi who had already reached the Other Shore, felt the pressure from the man's arrival.</p>

  <p>'How powerful... I'm afraid he has already reached the Chaotic Source Realm...' Ramzi thought to himself.</p>

  <p>In the face of such a strong master, Ramzi knew that even if he went all out, he would be no match for his opponent. The Holy Beings couldn't even dream of standing against the man.</p>

  <p>The strange man walked briskly toward them and suddenly pulled on Mike's and Holy Jay's arms. He greeted them excitedly, "Mike, Jay, how have you been?"</p>

  <p>The two were stunned.</p>

  <p>It was their first time visiting the Ruin Graveyard, so everyone felt grim and anxious. They then all got surprised when the newcomer suddenly greeted Mike and Holy Jay in such a friendly manner.</p>

  <p>The man was wearing a mask made of the head of an insect. Thus no one could even see his face clearly.</p>

  <p>"It's been years since we last saw each other! You can't even recognize my voice now," said the man as he pulled off the mask, revealing a handsome face of an elegant, middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>"Bromley?"</p>

  <p>"It's Bromley!"</p>

  <p>"Holy Bromley! It really is him!"</p>

  <p>Before Mike and Holy Jay could even react, the other Holy Beings recognized the man.</p>

  <p>Bromley came from one of the most powerful clans, after all. Even after he had been off the grid for years, the Gu Clan's Floating Island still ranked among the finest. He was indeed extraordinary, leaving a great impression on the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Some of them had once followed and supported Nicholas. Back then, they held grudges against Bromley.</p>

  <p>But these Holy Beings had already been punished by Luo Zheng. In the divine land, they were as docile as sheep. Now, they were extremely welcoming, as if Bromley was a long lost brother.</p>

  <p>For another moment, Mike and Holy Jay stared at Bromley.</p>

  <p>They had been separated for far too long. In that time, Bromley's cultivation base had greatly increased. There was a dramatic change in his aura, and at that moment, they almost didn't dare believe that the man standing before them was Bromley.</p>

  <p>Once that moment passed, however, they enveloped him in a tight embrace.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for your universe, we would've thought you were already dead," Mike said.</p>

  <p>A person's Rebirth Land could tell others of their general condition. In the Source World, Luo Zheng could roughly point out the Evil God's location through the Rebirth Land. While it was an obscure means of locating, it gave him the right direction to follow.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng left the divine land, Mike had asked him to investigate Bromley's whereabouts. But Bromley's universe gave him no clues.</p>

  <p>Lorena and Timotheus had explained that certain places existed to render the Rebirth Land ineffective. For instance, in the Chaos Ancient God's prison, the Rebirth Land was useless for finding one's location.</p>

  <p>If Bromley was in such a place, no one would've found him through the Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard was such a place? the Holy Being of the Fang Clan perished here.</p>

  <p>"I ended up in the Ruin Graveyard by accident. I'm always worried about you, Mike, but I just couldn't leave this place. I'm ashamed," Bromley said, lowering his head.</p>

  <p>Back then, there was no point for Bromley to stay in the divine land if he couldn't fight Nicholas. If he chose to battle him, the Gu Clan would've probably ended up the way the Luo Clan did. Leaving was the best thing he could do at the time.</p>

  <p>"You're not in the divine land, but you left a Immortal Mansion there, which helped me a lot," Mike said with a smile.</p>

  <p>In Mike's universe, Luo Zheng had been cultivated, and won the war against Murphy's universe. It all had something to do with the Immortal Mansion Bromley had left behind.</p>

  <p>After the Holy Beings settled down, they listened as the newly reunited friends chatted away.</p>

  <p>As they did, they heard of the process of Luo Zheng's growth? how he had defeated the Murphy Universe in the war, and how he had grown increasingly powerful in the divine land.</p>

  <p>For as long as they knew him, the Holy Beings merely assumed that Luo Zheng just had too much luck. Never did they expect to find so many twists and turns in his story. They just grew more in awe of him as they heard his story.</p>

  <p>Admiration flashed in Bromley's eyes as he listened to Mike's narration.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, he said, "Well, according to you, I'm not the one who makes the biggest contribution. As it turns out, it's your good son."</p>

  <p>"He's also your good disciple, haha!" Mike burst out in laughter.</p>

  <p>Although Bromley was Luo Zheng's master, they had never met personally. It was a strange thing.</p>

  <p>After briefly telling Bromley what had happened in the divine land, Mike asked, "Do you know what kind of place the Ruin Graveyard is? Do you really think we have no way of leaving this place?"</p>

  <p>Bromley's eyes gleamed with a sense of serenity as he said, "The Ruin Graveyard is extremely dangerous in the eyes of outsiders. It's another primitive land of chaos, but it's not as terrible as you probably think. There's a way to leave, but now's not the right time."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear more," Mike urged, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings left the divine land just to explore the Ruin Graveyard. It was just their luck to have bumped into Bromley there.</p>

  <p>And so Bromley told the Holy Beings of what he knew in great detail.</p>
