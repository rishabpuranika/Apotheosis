<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The things the Holy Emperor did this year had puzzled many members of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>After they had become enemies with the Qin Clan, He also tried his best to please the Leng Clan and betrothed the Princess Royal to them.</p>

  <p>Now, he even agreed to the dissolution of the Purple Soul Hall as requested by Alfredo!</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Samuel himself forced Joy to dissolve the Purple Soul Hall and that Alfredo was actually under his jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>On the day Joy and Alfredo quarreled, the former went to Samuel seeking justice but ended up going back to the Purple Soul Hall in silence.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea's rules were not absolute. In the past, cases of revisions on the Ruling Slate abounded.</p>

  <p>However, not every wealthy clan above the Time Sea had the ability to modify the rules.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan's fortune that they accumulated over the years was only enough for them to slightly modify some words on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Dongfang Clan could afford to revise an entire rule.</p>

  <p>Of course, rules couldn't be changed randomly. The Hall of Holy Beings still had restraints and each revision would only commence after many discussions among the clans.</p>

  <p>Moreover, a rule that would only prove beneficial to the Dongfang Clan would cost them. For example, if they made it so that they could be the only Floating Island on the Time Sea, then they would need countless divine might coins. It would be impossible to afford.</p>

  <p>This time, however, there was a big possibility for the Dongfang Clan to succeed in changing the rule. They had already obtained the approval of the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>... The union of nine wealthy clans was led by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Though the Hall of Holy Beings was not ruled by the Dongfang Clan alone, they still occupied nine seats in the Hall of Holy Beings. The connections also ran deep: the Mu Clan and Zhou Clan were quite close, the Zhao Clan was in an amicable relationship with the Fang Clan, and the Tang Clan was close to the Li Clan.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan, to a certain extent, could control the entirety of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Challenging them would be tantamount to challenging the entire Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>So long as the Dongfang Clan got the acquiescence of the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan, they could pass whatever revision they wanted and passing such a rule would no doubt have a far-reaching effect on all the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>To maintain the Han Clan's position, Samuel had to bow down to the powers above. This was the reason why he approached the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>He didn't really want to explain all of this to his daughter.</p>

  <p>"You're too young. You will only understand in time. The anonymous man who can have thirty-one consecutive wins has far exceeded the young me. I appreciate him and he most certainly will achieve great things in the future, however, if the Dongfang Clan fancies him then they can just take him away," he said lightly.</p>

  <p>Samuel did not really attach that much importance to this issue.</p>

  <p>First of all, it wasn't certain that the anonymous man was from the Han Clan. Samuel was currently trying to suck up to the Leng Clan in order to join the union of the wealthy clans. If the Dongfang Clan wanted him, Samuel could give the anonymous man to them.</p>

  <p>Besides, there were only a few days before the new rankings were announced. The Dongfang Clan wouldn't be in a hurry even if they wanted to get the anonymous man since they didn't really care about the points. Their position was currently unshakeable.</p>

  <p>Since the anonymous man accumulated a lot of points for the Han Clan, Samuel could use this as a way to impart favor onto the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>It was the perfect plan!</p>

  <p>Of course, he was currently unaware of the things that went through his daughter's mind nor did he know of the fact that she had already known the anonymous man in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and even had a secret crush on him, let alone that he was actually the son of Mike.</p>

  <p>Her father's words defied all her expectations. "Father, how could you do such a thing?" Liusu couldn't help but despair.</p>

  <p>Liusu was an innocent girl. To her, the anonymous man made such a huge contribution to the Han Clan and they should pay him back for it.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was unwilling to go to the Dongfang Clan then the Han Clan should do their best to keep him.</p>

  <p>It was only the right thing to do whether or not the anonymous man was actually Zheng.</p>

  <p>What her father planned to do was just so utilitarian to her.</p>

  <p>"But..." She still wanted to argue but her father merely shook his head in dismissal. "Stop worrying about this! Alfredo will take care of it. I heard you had a fight with the boy from the Leng Clan."</p>

  <p>"That's right." Apart from the matter about the anonymous man, Liusu also wanted to talk about her marriage with Langston. She didn't expect that her father would be the first to bring it up.</p>

  <p>"Langston Leng is a very outstanding man. Your marriage to him is very important to our clan. I'll ask Alfredo to take you to Leng Clan one of these days to apologize. All will be well," Samuel said.</p>

  <p>In truth, Liusu never entertained the notion of ever marrying Langston.</p>

  <p>She was filled with helplessness and was very obedient back then.</p>

  <p>However, now that she encountered Zheng once again, how could she be willing to marry that guy?</p>

  <p>Liusu had always thought that she was the apple of her father's eye but in the end, she was a mere bargaining chip to him. She couldn't help the surge of grief that welled up in her heart and could only look up to her father with cold eyes. "I don't want to marry him."</p>

  <p>Samuel, however, was oblivious to his daughter's mood. "Langston is an excellent man! He may not be as good as your brother but he is sure to become a consummate True God under his excellent cultivation."</p>

  <p>He continued to praise the young man but Liusu saw it fit to interrupt him. "In father's eyes, am I only a thing that can be used to please the Leng Clan? Is that all I'm ever good for?"</p>

  <p>Her question stunned Samuel silent.</p>

  <p>Despite being his child, Liusu had no right to question him that way.</p>

  <p>More so, he was the Holy Emperor of their clan which made her behaviour even more inappropriate.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't really have that many children. He only had two daughters: Liusu and Aleyna. If he had more children, then Liusu would've ended up being severely punished for her actions.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of anger in his face as he scolded her. "How dare you?!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I dare!" Liusu replied hotly. "If you really want to force me to marry that guy, then just kill me now!"</p>

  <p>"You think I won't?!" Samuel challenged, giving off an invisible aura.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being restrained his or her own aura so he or she looked like an ordinary True God most of the time, but in reality, their auras were extremely strong. When Samuel released his, the entire Floating Island of the Han Clan quivered slightly.</p>

  <p>He could kill Liusu hundreds, thousands of times with just a single glance.</p>

  <p>However, the moment his aura spread out, Samuel took it back almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings were very much experienced in the cycles of life so they had great control over their emotions.</p>

  <p>Having restrained his anger, Samuel sighed softly. "You can leave now.</p>

  <p>Let's talk about this some other day."</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about this now!" Liusu insisted.</p>

  <p>However, her father simply waved his hand and released an invisible force, pushing her out of the palace. The gate also closed with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>Liusu trembled in anger in front of the palace. It took quite a while for her to calm down. At that moment, she suddenly thought of Joy, then she slowly left here.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends...</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in the middle of a bloody red plain.</p>

  <p>This was exactly the space that was used when Harold challenged Rachelle.</p>

  <p>After winning thirty-two consecutive fights, Zheng now had 1.85 million points which far exceeded the amount Joy requested.</p>

  <p>He accepted Nelly's challenge, as promised.</p>

  <p>She slowly walked towards him with a smile. "It seems we will be on the same side in the future."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You will eventually join the Dongfang Clan in the future. Our Mu Clan is with the Dongfang Clan so we will naturally be on the same side,"</p>

  <p>Nelly explained.</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng could only repeat the question.</p>

  <p>"It is a great honor to be liked by the Dongfang Clan. A lot of True Gods want to join their clan and there is no way to refuse if you are chosen by them. Pearl has a high status in the Dongfang Clan so it's not advisable to provoke her," Nelly continued.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to persuade me for her?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I'm just giving you some advice. It's also compensation for you once I win and collect all the points you've gotten so far," she said. Nelly then stretched out her white arms and let a red and green halo spread throughout her body.</p>
