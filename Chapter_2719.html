  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames surrounded Zheng on all sides. They were, however, essentially harmless. They were disembodied entities, but they were not souls. They were the engravings, the marks that etched themselves onto souls to record one's life.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew he didn't need to take any precautions against these intangible entities.</p>

  <p>However, every Memory Flame contained a countless number of memories, and memories were powerful things.</p>

  <p>These particular Memory Flames moved like waves, and were chosen personally by the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>When the Memory Flames washed towards Zheng, all the memories they contained entered his soul at once.</p>

  <p>In the span of less than a second, dozens of images flooded his soul and his mind, all at the same time.</p>

  <p>Desire, power, medicine refinement, remote mountains, the sky...</p>

  <p>All kinds of scenes, involving work, daily life, thoughts and feelings, were surging through his soul wildly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was unable to absorb all of these memories in such a short time, and he felt like his head was about to explode.</p>

  <p>The surface of his soul had already started to crack.</p>

  <p>If another person had been overwhelmed like this by the Memory Flames, their soul would have broken down very quickly.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was being attacked by the Memory Flames, the Stone Mouse left and rushed down the steps.</p>

  <p>"How careless of you..." whispered No. 9527 in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>As much as it wanted to leave Zheng to his own devices, the situation was dire and No. 9527 had no choice but to manipulate Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Then, under No. 9527's control, Zheng kicked his legs violently and his whole body rolled backwards.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>He rolled until he reached the steps, and then proceeded to tumble down them.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames that had rushed towards Zheng couldn't reach the steps. They continued to circle just above the steps before slowly returning to the sea of Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Zheng, meanwhile, having tumbled all the way downwards, rolled to a stop at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>For a moment, he kept still, lying on the ground and staring blankly at the ceiling as the massive torrent of memories continued to flash across his mind.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you okay?" No. 9527 shouted anxiously.</p>

  <p>As the minutes went by, Zheng gradually regained his normal senses.</p>

  <p>"I'm ok. It's nothing. But it was so dangerous just now. I was complacent, again."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face betrayed his shaken state. He had not expected the Memory Flames to have so much power.</p>

  <p>"That damn mouse..."</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately stood up and rose into the air. Floating in mid-air, he stretched out his hand and gave it a flick.</p>

  <p>A small fire ball rolled right out of his outstretched palm.</p>

  <p>The little fireball was flung into the air, and as it flew, it burned like a comet, growing larger and larger as it hurtled through space.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>As it continued to burn and gather speed, the fireball turned blue, emitting heat and light so intense. It made the darkness around them bright as day.</p>

  <p>Now that the region was bathed in light, they could see that they were standing amidst the ruins of a palace.</p>

  <p>Pillars, arches, and the remains of a mote surrounded them. In front of them stood a crumbling old staircase leading to what used to be three altars.</p>

  <p>The altar in the middle, the largest of the three, must have been the place where the Stone Mouse had been reincarnated. A level above the three altars was a huge metal door.</p>

  <p>On either side of it stood a statue with three heads and six arms. It was a statue that Zheng was very familiar with.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Chiyou's statue?" Zheng rolled his eyes in surprise. He knew perfectly well what the statue was.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had more urgent problems to deal with than stare at a door. He had to find that irksome mouse first.</p>

  <p>Now, the Stone Mouse only had the strength of a low-rank True God. A being with that level of strength like the Stone Mouse could run away when Zheng was attacked by the Memory Flames. However, it wouldn't get far.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept the area, and surely, he located the figure of the Stone Mouse, scurrying away hastily, not far away from where he stood.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng flapped the wings on his back and rose into the air. Before long, he had caught up with the fleeing Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was pursuing it, the Stone Mouse rolled on the ground, its eyes turning bright red. A mirage formed above the mouse, which then rushed towards Zheng like a ghost.</p>

  <p>This illusion was a secret method used to control one's soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng already had experience with this particular weapon. While following Leland and his group, Zheng had been hit by it after having been too careless.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng would not let down his guard, not for a second. Even if the Stone Mouse used the Hallucinatory Fragrance to attack him, it would be a vain effort.</p>

  <p>"Hoo!"</p>

  <p>Zheng dodged the illusion with ease, and flicked his finger as he did so.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>He raised a thunder whip and lashed at the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>The immense power of the thunder whip blasted the Stone Mouse straight up into the air!</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak, squeak... Please don't kill me..." pleaded the Stone Mouse in a strange voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, disregarded these pleas. He did not hesitate, maintaining his assault. He knew how manipulative this little creature could be.</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't stop until he had given the mouse over a dozen lashes.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's body had turned black after having being hit by the thunder and lightning. The air was heavy with the stench of singed hair and flesh.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked over to the Stone Mouse and poked it. Obviously dead, it did not respond. Then, Zheng picked up the corpse of the Stone Mouse, walked determinedly to the altar and slammed the mouse onto it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just like the last time, the dead body of the Stone Mouse immediately decayed, as if time had been sped up. The ashes spread across the surface and dissolved into the altar.</p>

  <p>However, after a few seconds, a wind stirred the surface of the altar, and lifted the ashes into the air. Soon, like a phoenix, the Stone Mouse was reborn.</p>

  <p>Zheng had guessed right.</p>

  <p>In theory, the Stone Mouse was essentially immortal.</p>

  <p>However, after each resurrection, the mouse's cultivation base seemed to fall a little. Now, it was the same level as a proving godly warrior's cultivation base.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Don't kill me!" begged the mouse again.</p>

  <p>Realizing what Zheng intended to do, it resorted to begging for mercy.</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed his finger at the Stone Mouse. "I am not interested in killing you. But you leave me no choice! Every time we meet, you try to kill me!"</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse had already fooled him once with the illusion in the past. Zheng wouldn't allow that to happen again.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for No. 9527, Zheng could have been torn apart by those big mice.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse had also manipulated those Memory Flames, which had nearly made Zheng's soul collapse. Zheng knew he couldn't trust anything it said.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care if he had to kill this mouse a hundred times over.</p>

  <p>Now, however, seeing the cold determination in Zheng's eyes, the Stone Mouse suddenly became meek and deferential. It squeaked sheepishly for a while and then looked at Zheng with big, pleading eyes. "I was just following my master's orders! He wants to control the entire Reincarnation Land and won't stand for anyone else to occupy it!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't your master Gregorio?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I must warn you that you will never be able to kill me!" squeaked the mouse shakily. "My master will come back soon! You will be the one who is dead by then. I will even erase your Memory Flame, so that you can never be reincarnated!" The Stone Mouse spoke as if it were trying to convince itself of being in control more than it was trying to threaten Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng could see right through the mouse's pretense. He smiled. "And what if I manage to take control of the Reincarnation Land?" scoffed Zheng condescendingly.</p>

  <p>"Squeak... You?" the Stone Mouse said with a disbelieving sneer. "Even my master is not qualified, let alone you!" it exclaimed, its voice becoming more high-pitched with every word.</p>

  <p>Zheng was suddenly curious. "What qualifications do I need?" he asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Land was established specially for the Nine Li race to be reincarnated. If you want to control this place, the blood of the Nine Li race must flow through your veins!" the Stone Mouse answered desperately.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng was slightly stunned, but a small, triumphant smile lifted the edges of his lips.</p>

  <p>At the same time, No. 9527 spoke, "It's almost the same as what I guessed. The divine land was opened by Chiyou, so he naturally wanted to use it for the reincarnation of his people. But at some point, something must have gone wrong. That must be why Gregorio has owned the Stone Mouse. This little mouse does not serve the Nine Li race. It also acknowledges Gregorio as its owner and follows him loyally of its own will."</p>

  <p>"You might be right..." Zheng said to No. 9527 in agreement, his mind immersed deep in thought.</p>
