<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3916 See The Cold Prison Again </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lamont didn't expect that the Li Shan mountain would have prepared so thoroughly.</p>

  <p>Without any defense, he was dragged into the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat.</p>

  <p>In Li Shan mountain, Lamont only took the Snake Goddess and Fuxi seriously. The rest were close to nothing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Little did he know that these nobodies didn't rely on Li Shan mountain to hold on and struggle for life, but tried to find a chance to kill him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Lamont could not believe his eyes as he saw countless massive energy windstorms that rotated at high speed.</p>

  <p>When he felt the terrifying energy, the contempt in his eyes disappeared and was replaced with an expression of uncertainty and caution.</p>

  <p>"Where am I? This place exists in the Source World?" There happened to be many dangerous places in the Source World, but most were only considered dangerous for True Gods and the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>As for the powerful masters like Lamont, there was no place in the chaos that they couldn't explore, nor was there any place dangerous enough to threaten their lives.</p>

  <p>However, today was a different story. This dangerous place was the last thing Lamont had expected.</p>

  <p>His initial reaction was to assume that he was merely hallucinating and that everything he saw was an illusion. However, with one simple distinction, he soon understood that this was real, and so was the roaring energy of this horrific place.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A strong space fluctuation burst out from the body of Lamont, who wanted nothing else but to leave the world.</p>

  <p>However, because the space was formed in the stomach of the Primordial Energy Cat, his theurgies were completely ineffective.</p>

  <p>"This is bad!"</p>

  <p>As he realized the gravity of his situation, Lamont had already seen a mass of energy windstorm rolling towards him.</p>

  <p>In the past, his solid ice armor could withstand Yan's attack, because any energy that came into contact with it would soon be affected by the armor's extremely low temperature.</p>

  <p>The stronger the energy was, the higher its temperature would be. This meant that when the temperature dropped, the energy would grow stagnant.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the solid ice armor was also the standing nemesis of the energy windstorm!</p>

  <p>However, the strength of the energy windstorm was far from what Lamont had expected. In the beginning, the energy windstorms had been blocked by the solid ice armor, but after the energy windstorms swept across the armor, they managed to leave thin lines across the surface.</p>

  <p>At first, there were dozens of lines, which later on became a thousand. The number of the lines increased too fast to even observe!</p>

  <p>When the number of lines on the armor reached hundreds of thousands, the armor shattered onto the ground.</p>

  <p>"Condense!"</p>

  <p>Ready for anything, Lamont instantly condensed his disintegrated armor.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the once destroyed armor was good as new, and it attached itself onto his body easily.</p>

  <p>Then, the first wave of energy windstorms had dissipated, meaning Lamont withstood it head-on.</p>

  <p>But then came the second, the third and the fourth waves of energy windstorms that showed no mercy.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of energy windstorms existed in this world. Even at the edge of the world, more energy windstorms were generated from the thick, pure energy.</p>

  <p>Lamont gritted his teeth and held on, observing such a ruthless world. At this point, he felt like he was going crazy.</p>

  <p>Even the Other Shore Tokens couldn't release such energy, so how did the Li Shan mountain even make it?</p>

  <p>Clatter...</p>

  <p>The solid ice armor shattered again.</p>

  <p>Although Lamont could condense his armor at will, it still consumed much of the power of truth within him.</p>

  <p>As Lamont's power of truth decreased each time the solid ice armor was condensed, the armor grew thinner and more vulnerable to the blows of the windstorms.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, though the energy windstorms in the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat raged, it appeared quiet and still.</p>

  <p>Just then, it curled up on the shoulder of King Ieuan, as if it was sound asleep.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, King Ieuan pressed its index finger on the Primordial Energy Cat's head. By doing so, it could quickly observe what was happening in its belly.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, what's the situation?"</p>

  <p>Dempsey asked politely. Because they had put so much effort into their mission, the handful of Ear Mice were naturally concerned. "I don't think he can hold out any longer," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, the Divine Crystal Array could kill a Chaos Ancient God according to its initial design.</p>

  <p>However, King Ieuan was still nervous. After all, Lamont was in control of the truth.</p>

  <p>Oakley and Dempsey nodded in approval and waited silently.</p>

  <p>At the very top of Li Shan mountain, Luo Zheng and Yan heard the voice of King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>The two of them sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Chaos Ancient God had been suppressed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's state of mind happened to be much calmer than King Ieuan's.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng was much younger than King Ieuan, what he had faced and conquered was far beyond what King Ieuan had encountered.</p>

  <p>Over the many chaotic eras, many Sons of Truth had passed away.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, in the Abstruse Energy World, the Sons of Truth meant nothing.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and Yan paid close attention to the movements ongoing in the Li Shan mountain. They knew that before the Chaos Ancient God died, everything could change, so they had to be on guard.</p>

  <p>After five minutes passed, King Ieuan slightly frowned and looked down.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Primordial Energy Cat opened its eyes.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The Primordial Energy Cat sensed the strangeness that occurred in its inner world.</p>

  <p>But just as it was about to intensify the energy in its body, its stomach expanded to more than two hundred feet wide.</p>

  <p>The rapid expanse even knocked King Ieuan, Oakley, and Dempsey out of the way.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Whoosh... Before King Ieuan could regain its balance, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up and expanded once again to more than three thousand feet!</p>

  <p>This space created in the Li Shan mountain was only five thousand feet high, and more than half of that space was occupied by the Primordial Energy Cat.</p>

  <p>The expression on the creature remained innocent despite this, and it let out a roaring whine.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Oakley and Dempsey sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan also shook its head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Once again, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up. This time, it rose to fifty thousand feet wide!</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of the expanding body, the cave inside the Li Shan mountain cracked and fell apart.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng, who watched from the jadeite platform, rose into the air and grabbed Yan. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>Yan was in charge of the Cloud Cover Array, so she couldn't just leave without consent.</p>

  <p>"If you don't leave, you will die!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's tone was demanding and almost harsh.</p>

  <p>Yan hesitated for a moment and then pointed to a peak in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Let's head there first!"</p>

  <p>It was the Panoramic View Peak, where the second center of the Cloud Cover Array existed. She then brought the golden dress-like array to the Panoramic View Peak so that she could simultaneously control the entire Cloud Cover Array.</p>

  <p>In sheer desperation, Luo Zheng hastily agreed.</p>

  <p>Just as he took his sister away, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up again. From fifty thousand feet in width, it rose to three million feet.</p>

  <p>The Primordial Energy Cat didn't have the Wild God Body, so its physical ability could not withstand the pressure. Eventually, its round belly exploded with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Lamont's massive body finally escaped and he restored himself into a huge monster. The middle of the Li Shan mountain was completely overturned by him!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the strange energy radiated from Lamont's body as a peculiar phenomenon appeared.</p>

  <p>The stones and trees that surrounded him seemed to have lost their weight as they hovered around him.</p>

  <p>After a moment, these stones and trees morphed into countless white dots of light that flashed dramatically and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Yan blinked her eyes as she saw this, surprised with what just happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was familiar with this as he had seen something similar in the Blooming Jade Stage. It was the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>With this Cold Prison to protect Lamont, no matter how powerful the energy was, it proved to be no threat to him.</p>
