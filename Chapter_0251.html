<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 251 The Lightning Horse Of The Li Family </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These Illuminating Soul Realm masters were all the backbone of the top seven noble clans. If they had been killed in the fairy palace, it would bring shame and dishonor on the top seven clans.</p>

  <p>"I don't need to prove myself. Go and find out for yourself. It's none of my business. Listen, I'm getting out of here now, and if anyone tries to stop me, I will kill him!" Zheng angrily said. He was about to leave when someone shouted, "You can't go without explaining to our Huang family!</p>

  <p>I won't let you leave here alive if you don't!" A nature creature from the Huang family blocked Zheng's way. He turned his life vitality into a small green dragon that rushed towards Zheng with an open mouth.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted while firing the demonic life vitality from his hands.</p>

  <p>"Peng!"</p>

  <p>The demonic life vitality crushed the green small dragon before it could approach Zheng. Although the green small dragon was transformed from life vitality, it wasn't swallowed by Zheng's life vitality, because its grade was not high enough. After hitting the green small dragon, Zheng went straight for the nature creature of the Huang family with sparkling stars on his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't use the Heavenly Ogre Fist. He just wrapped his hand with power by activating the demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>The moment that the demonic life vitality hit the nature creature, the sparkling stars suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>Each of the sparkling stars was only about the size of a rice grain, but its massive explosive powers shocked even the nature creatures.</p>

  <p>The stars were destroyed one by one as they exploded.</p>

  <p>By the time the explosions were over, the nature creature of the Huang family had totally disappeared.</p>

  <p>Crushing the opponent into ash with just one hit! What an incredible power! The Illuminating Soul Realm masters were at awe by what they had seen. Even they couldn't have possibly made it.</p>

  <p>The faces of the nature creatures turned pale in horror and surprise.</p>

  <p>"He was just half a step into the nature level when he entered the fairy palace, but he was able to defeat Leon and killed him. Look at him now!</p>

  <p>He can now transform the life energy in his body to life vitality. He is progressing fast! Now that he has become a nature creature and his competence has improved significantly, we are now no match for him!" someone said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around and asked coldly, "Does anyone else want to stop me?"</p>

  <p>There was silence in the place. Not one nature creature would want to battle Zheng now. After a while, a young man stepped forward from the crowd and said to Zheng, "You must explain in detail about what happened in the fairy place."</p>

  <p>"What if I don't want to explain?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said with fury in his eyes. Seeing how furious Zheng was, the young man took a few steps back and calmed himself down. He continued, "If you don't want to explain, you'll have to make up for the loss of our top seven noble clans."</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed hysterically as if he just heard the funniest joke of his life.</p>

  <p>"Make up for the loss? Why should I do that? Who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had suffered a lot because of the noble clans, and since then, he had held a grudge against the noble clans.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the young man's face looked even paler. He continued,</p>

  <p>"Aren't you becoming a little too arrogant for your rank?"</p>

  <p>The members of the top seven noble clans feared Zheng's power, but they had seen various masters since they were young. Most of the top ten disciples of Cloud Sect came from the most gifted disciples of the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>The nature creatures came from the noble clans were offended when Zheng paid them no mind at all. They found it hard to keep calm at the arrogant young man.</p>

  <p>"I'm too arrogant?" Zheng chuckled and stepped forward and said, "Here's what I offer. Go back to your home and tell your elders that I will eliminate the noble clans one by one for the rest of my life. Then you'll see what real arrogance is!"</p>

  <p>The other nature creatures were flustered with anger because of Zheng's arrogance. However, there was nothing they could do because Zheng was stronger than they were. He even had killed the nature creature of the Huang family.</p>

  <p>As no one else stopped him, Zheng finally left.</p>

  <p>They said nothing until they were sure that Zheng had left completely.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng was out of the valley, they started to discuss the matter at hand. It wasn't about the safety of the Illuminating Soul Realm masters anymore but the arrogance and power of Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>"The grassroot men's violent nature will lead them to die young despite their skills and talent. The genius members from our Yu family are not inferior to him, and they are much more polite and modest than he is."</p>

  <p>"Let's not worry about today. The young man in the mask would surely die soon! Let's wait and see! He must die!"</p>

  <p>"I don't need you to tell me! We are the pillars of the Burning Sky Empire and all who oppose us must die! That young man is no exception!"</p>

  <p>The nature creatures were boasting about their authority to one another.</p>

  <p>But none of them had dared to speak ill of Zheng when he was around.</p>

  <p>After leaving from Dragon Valley, Zheng felt ecstatic somehow. He was sure that the nature creatures would talk about him behind his back, but he didn't care. He knew that the noble clans must be repressed so that they could feel fear.</p>

  <p>When he arrived in G County, he thought of buying a horse to speed up his journey. He was looking for a fast horse, but the small place like G County only raised ordinary horses.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was eager to buy a good kind of horse, a hostler ran after him when he was about to leave. The hostler said, "Sir, I know someone who has the horse you're looking for."</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Where can I find that person?" Zheng was quite eager to buy a horse and didn't care who he would be buying the horse from.</p>

  <p>The hostler pointed at a house in a distance and said, "The Li Family who live over there. They are the richest family in G County, and they own the fastest horse in this county. The young master always rides this horse around."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at the hostler and paid him some gold leaves which he took from his space ring. The hostler was happy and thanked Zheng for his generosity. But he didn't forget to remind Zheng, "The young master of the Li family is a short-tempered lad. If you want to buy the horse, you should have enough patience to talk him through it."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled slightly and thanked the hostler for his advice. But whether he would talk to the young master patiently or not was up to his mood.</p>

  <p>Following the instruction of the hostler, Zheng walked through a street full of luxury buildings owned by the Li family. It was obvious because all of these buildings had a diamond-shaped wooden sign carved with the word</p>

  <p>"Li".</p>

  <p>Shortly, he arrived at the gate of the Li mansion where he was greeted by two attendants in leather armor. They shouted at him, "Don't stand here!</p>

  <p>This is not a public place. If you don't leave soon, we will catch and imprison you for trespassing!"</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could talk back to the attendants, he heard a neigh of the horse. When he turned around, he saw a man riding on horseback coming towards the gate from the street.</p>

  <p>Zheng had better eyesight than any normal person and he could see the horse clearly from afar. He noticed that as the horse's feet touched the ground, it produced a blue spark. It had incredible speed, not something that he had seen from any other horse. It was indeed the horse he was going to buy!</p>

  <p>At the blink of the eye, the horse had already covered a great distance of the long street.</p>

  <p>As the lightning horse dashed through the street to the gate of the Li mansion, a cart carrying children suddenly came out of an alley.</p>

  <p>It was a skinny old man who was pulling the cart. He didn't expect that a horse was coming at such high speed. He was stunned and could not move because of panic.</p>

  <p>"What the fuck?" the man riding the horse cursed. He was young and aggressive. From the silk robe he was wearing, he must be the young master of the Li family.</p>

  <p>All the bystanders on the street could not bear to look at what could possibly happen once the horse hit the cart. They were expecting the worst – that the kids and the old man would die if the horse turned over the cart and ran over them.</p>

  <p>When the horse was about to collide with the cart, Zheng came in between and caught the horse's forelegs to avoid the collision.</p>

  <p>"It's dangerous here! Go and move your cart now!" Zheng said lightly to the old man while he was lifting the horse's forelegs.</p>

  <p>The old man was surprised by Zheng's action. His eyes were still filled with panic. But he immediately moved the cart out of the way as Zheng instructed.</p>

  <p>Holding on to his horse to avoid from falling, the young man shouted,</p>

  <p>"Bastard, what do you think you're doing? Let go of my horse now!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened with fury when he heard the young man cursing him. He carefully put down the horse's legs to avoid hurting it.</p>

  <p>"Are you out of your mind? How dare you stop my horse? You're courting death!" As soon as the horse was back on its four feet, the young man tried to snap his lash at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng caught the lash with his fingers and wrapped the end around his hand.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the attendants at the Li mansion gate rushed over and shouted, "Let go of the whip, dumb ass! How dare you offend our young master! Kneel before our master now or you're dead!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sneered at the attendants and instead of letting the whip go, he pulled it causing the young man to topple down from the horse's back.</p>

  <p>The young master was used to VIP treatment everywhere he went and didn't imagine anyone who would treat him otherwise; so, when Zheng played him as a fool, he was stunned.</p>

  <p>The attendants, however, were quick to make a move. They took out their weapons and pointed them at Zheng, "You're in big trouble! If you had just knelt, we would have let you go after a hundred beatings. But we're afraid that we would have to cut you in pieces for what you did!"</p>
