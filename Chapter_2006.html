<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Back when Luo Luo Zheng was just an Internal Elixir Realm cultivator she remembered him speaking so arrogantly to her.</p>

  <p>Even at that time, Yao had known that this youth enjoyed more than ordinary luck, but she had not dreamed that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to reach such heights!</p>

  <p>If the two Supreme Lords had not been able to block him, this brat would have broken into the Pools of Faith. That would have been an unimaginable disaster for Yao.</p>

  <p>"And you? Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Yao slowly approached the Inauguration Altar, her eyes fixed on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her smile grew wider, and her intent to kill him also became increasingly apparent. "I deeply regret letting you live for so long, but now this will bring it to an end!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was lying inside the hole, his eyes sparkled. Supreme Lord Shadow was lying beside him. Supreme Lord Shadow had the help from the Queen of Life, so it was almost impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to kill him. Now Yao was here, and the Queen of Life was also watching him covetously?</p>

  <p>At that moment, the spirit beast bag on Luo Zheng's back trembled slightly. He recalled that when he had returned from the Immortal Mansion he had brought that Ancestral Dragon with him.</p>

  <p>Right then, his eyes narrowed slightly as a bold idea began to take shape in his mind!</p>

  <p>The situation was desperate, and he was unable to think of any other option.</p>

  <p>As he considered this, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly grabbed the band of light of the Death Chain and with all his might, pulled it fiercely towards him once again.</p>

  <p>With the assistance from the Queen of Life, Supreme Lord Shadow's physical body had fully recovered.</p>

  <p>However, he was still feeling dazed following the beating Luo Luo Zheng had given him so he waited for Yao to make the first move before helping her to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was for Luo Luo Zheng to pull him over again?</p>

  <p>Unable to resist the terrifying power that came from the other side of the chain, he could only silently curse as he was forced to fly towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord Shadow flew out, he crashed hard into the side of the Inauguration Altar!</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng was using Supreme Lord Shadow as a meteor hammer.</p>

  <p>As he continued to wave his hand, everywhere that Supreme Lord Shadow's body swept through immediately turned into a total mess.</p>

  <p>Countless cracks began to appear in the cyan stone on the Inauguration Altar. The broken pieces of the stone started to drop like rain and to cover Luo Luo Zheng who was below.</p>

  <p>Hidden under the stone pieces, Luo Zheng's spirit beast bag moved slightly and suddenly something jumped out. At the same time, a strand of soul shot out from the spot between Luo Zheng's eyebrows and entered the crack behind the cyan stones!</p>

  <p>As Yao saw the dust which billowed at the side of the Inauguration Altar, her lips twisted into a cruel smirk. "There is no way you can survive. Give up the useless struggle!"</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, she raised the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand?</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A thick bolt of lightning shot out from the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer and struck the hole!</p>

  <p>In an instant all the broken stones disappeared, revealing Luo Luo Zheng standing alone?</p>

  <p>When the bolt of lightning struck, it had targeted both Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Shadow. They had both been able to withstand the bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked much the same but the body of Supreme Lord Shadow had been scorched black.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow had endured quite a bit of suffering yet Ying had not removed the Link of Life. The wounds which the lightning had caused had quickly healed. There was no danger of him dying. He was a Supreme Lord, yet he was being grabbed in Luo Zheng's hand and was circling in the air like a meteor hammer. Wasn't this situation too miserable for him?</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng made Supreme Lord Shadow continuously spin around above his head, and he slowly floated up into the air. He had already sent the crucial thing to the Inauguration Altar, so he had no choice but to brace himself. As for how long he could last, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng glanced at Leroy who was high above in the sky and nodded. "Action!"</p>

  <p>Abruptly, He pulled back the band of light in his hand. Supreme Lord Shadow swung in the air, smashing down towards Yao!</p>

  <p>At the same time?</p>

  <p>The figure of Leroy slid to the side as he reached out his hands to tap his chest. A Blood-devouring Bone Arrow was knocked to the bowstring. A golden light flashed in his eyes as he used Fixed Vision token to lock his target onto Yao who was below!</p>

  <p>Neither of them displayed any hesitation at all!</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Korbin saw that Leroy took a move, the flame in his hand began to flutter. A gigantic flame pattern began to spread across the sky, forming a beautiful picture scroll, which blocked Leroy in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Crackle?"</p>

  <p>"A Thousand fire birds burn the sky!"</p>

  <p>Fire birds appeared from the flame picture scroll. They briefly hovered in the sky and then rushed down towards Leroy!</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was a lazy smile on Ying's face. She wasn't interested in the conflict between Yao and Luo Luo Zheng, but she couldn't disobey the order of the Soul-sealing Needle. Now that Yao had returned to the Demon Night, she had no choice but to follow her.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Soul-sealing Needle, she wouldn't have helped Yao.</p>

  <p>In fact, she was more interested in Luo Luo Zheng? It was a pity that her position was completely different from Luo Zheng's. At this point in time, she could only make a move against him!</p>

  <p>She spread out her hands, and a green light appeared in her palms. As the green light continuously condensed, it quickly turned into a thin willow leaf. After Ying caught the willow leaf, she threw it towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The willow leave floated with the wind and drew a crooked path in the air as it swept towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yao saw Luo Luo Zheng dragging Supreme Lord Shadow so that he would smash towards her. As she took a step forward, her entire body was concealed in a bolt of lightning?</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning first shot towards the sky, avoiding Supreme Lord Shadow thrown at her by Luo Luo Zheng. After that, in the blink of an eye, a strange turn of events had closed in on Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Yao and Luo Luo Zheng maintained a very close distance. When she floated in the air, she was much taller than Luo Luo Zheng, and she squared her shoulders, looking down at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She waved the chain in her hand. Intense Thunder Law appeared on the surface of the round hammer at the end of her weapon, and she viciously smashed it down towards him!</p>

  <p>"Go down!"</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, the flying Supreme Lord Shadow had been pulled back by Luo Luo Zheng, and was now standing right above him!</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>With an ear-splitting explosion, Supreme Lord Shadow was struck by Yao's hammer!</p>

  <p>In this moment, Supreme Lord Shadow was desperate?</p>

  <p>Although Queen of Life could protect his life, he had still become a weapon in Luo Zheng's hands. How could a dignified Supreme Lord like him be expected to endure this?</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>This strike was ineffective. Yao's expression remained unchanged.</p>

  <p>After the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer had spun in a circle, it once again smashed towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had nowhere to retreat. He could only take the blow from Yao. The Great Weighty Sword in his hand swung in the air as it drew a sharp sword arc, slashing towards the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword was a highly condensed weapon, and Yao's Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer was one of the most powerful weapons in the universe, so it wasn't light either!</p>

  <p>As these two weapons came together, the collision was equivalent to millions of mountains colliding. The reverberations of the powerful impact spread out and even disrupted the force field of the entire Rosy Cloud World. This massive Rosy Cloud World began to sway like a large ship in a storm!</p>

  <p>Everyone could feel the tremor spreading across the ground. This was not an ordinary earthquake, but the entire supreme world began to tilt and shake, as if it was going to capsize at any moment.</p>

  <p>"What a strong power!"</p>

  <p>A strange expression flashed across Yao's face.</p>

  <p>The reason why she possessed such powerful strength was because of the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>Usually, when she extracted energy from the Pool of Faith, it would, at most, only cause a ripple to run across the surface of the pool.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, there wasn't even a ripple. However, now the water in the Pool of Faith was churning non-stop?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength was strong enough to actually shake the Pool of Faith that had accumulated Faith Energy from numerous Demon Night members for countless years.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng retreated a few steps, he too felt that the situation was quite tricky. The lightning that had been transmitted from the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer just now hadn't hurt Luo Luo Zheng, but it had still numbed his entire body!</p>

  <p>His strength was the only advantage he had when facing Yao.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after blocking her attack with his sword, he didn't pause.</p>

  <p>Forcing himself to suppress the numbness in his body, he slashed at Yao once again!</p>

  <p>However, before he could strike out with his sword, a green willow leaf silently floated towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The willow leaf had brushed against Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword, but it was as if that light leaf did not exist in this world as it directly pierced through the heavy sword and got onto Luo Zheng's wrist. There was no way at all to dodge it!</p>

  <p>The moment the willow leaf stuck to him, Luo Luo Zheng felt his right hand go numb. He had lost all his strength all of a sudden!</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword he held in his hand was extremely heavy.</p>

  <p>Even though the hilt was made of the Infinity Stone, it's weight was equivalent to that of half a great world. How could Luo Luo Zheng continue to hold it?</p>

  <p>Whoosh?</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword slipped out of Luo Zheng's hand and smashed downwards!</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene unfolding below her, Yao sneered. She stretched out her hand and sent the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer downwards once again!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The hammer struck Luo Luo Zheng in the chest, causing him to plummet downwards along with the Great Weighty Sword. The unlucky Supreme Lord Shadow was also dragged down along with Luo Luo Zheng as he was still connected to the Death Chain.</p>
