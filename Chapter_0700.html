<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the other participants could not believe what they were seeing for a moment. They all froze in astonishment as they witnessed the destructive power of Zheng's pagoda.</p>

  <p>From merely its appearance, they assessed that it was more powerful than theirs. They were still figuring out how Zheng managed to reinforce his pagoda during the first round and made it this formidable.</p>

  <p>The power of Zheng's pagoda was beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>During the first stage of pre-qualifying match, most of the 400 participants were already knocked down. The remaining cultivators who were still running at the chance to make it to the main event were the cream of the crop.</p>

  <p>The round with the giant turtles was typically difficult. Only those who had exceptional strength and patience could survive the violent attacks of the hill-like giant turtles.</p>

  <p>Most of these participants had exerted all their means to cope with the giant turtles. Some of them had used powerful secret skills, and others had expended their blood essence. Nevertheless, they had managed to pass the test and reinforce their pagodas to level ten. Now, there was only one task left for them to do. They were supposed to challenge other participants, defeat them, and advance to the main draw match!</p>

  <p>But now, upon seeing Zheng's pagoda, they knew that their chances of advancing became thin.</p>

  <p>After realizing that, their astonishment on their faces was replaced with anger and resentment. They felt disgruntled at the seemingly unfair advantage of Zheng's pagoda over others. They all wondered, 'He's only at the level three of Illuminating Soul Realm, but why is his pagoda stronger than ours? There's no way he could have done that! He must have cheated!'</p>

  <p>If they were in the real world, they could just repress their anger and submit to this unfair situation they were facing. After all, there could be nothing they could do to defeat Zheng unless they wanted to commit suicide.</p>

  <p>In the magic array, however, they wouldn't really die. Thus, they could attack Zheng without the fear of dying, which they did without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Kill this cheater!"</p>

  <p>"Let's attack him together! He can't defend himself from all of us!"</p>

  <p>"The World Commercial Alliance must have helped him! For sure he cheated! That's unfair!"</p>

  <p>As they rushed towards Zheng, the archers from their level-ten pagodas also raised their bows and began shooting mysterious ice arrows at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Zoom!"</p>

  <p>There were ten archers on every level-ten pagoda. There were over one hundred archers from the furious participants' pagodas who started shooting at Zheng simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Every shot from an archer on a level-ten pagoda had the same power as an all-out attack from a cultivator at the middle level of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>So, right now, Zheng was facing a power equivalent of over one hundred cultivators at that realm.</p>

  <p>The arrows shot almost filled the sky above Zheng. Every arrow had extremely great power. That was starting to shadow on Zheng and the weight was becoming heavy for Zheng to see.</p>

  <p>At the face of quite a violent attack, Zheng put his game on. He never looked as serious as he was now. He could have defended himself using his level twelve pagoda, but he didn't. He dared not to use his pagoda on his defense.</p>

  <p>"Avoid!"</p>

  <p>Zheng controlled his pagoda using his mind and instructed it to move. It did move several thousand feet in just a second and narrowly avoided the rain of arrows.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng commanded his archers to retaliate. Each archer on his pagoda was at the same level as a cultivator of Virtual Tribulation Realm. As Zheng instructed, his twelve archers raised their bows in sync.</p>

  <p>The cultivators in the magic array were nowhere near the level of Zheng's pagoda and his bowmen. Hence, the pagoda was an invincible rival to these cultivators.</p>

  <p>"Zoom!"</p>

  <p>Twelve shining arrows started shooting out from Zheng's pagoda. They had much stronger momentum than the ones aimed at Zheng. With their speed, it was almost impossible to avoid them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The arrows immediately exploded as they hit their targets. Instantly, twelve participants who were after Zheng vanished. Not only did they fail the test, but they also missed their chances to advance to the main contest.</p>

  <p>"Amazing! He knocked down that many participants in one blow!" Upon seeing the unfortunate fate that the twelve participants faced, the rest of the participants could only lower their hands in disappointment. They realized that it was just too impossible to defeat Zheng even if they attacked simultaneously.</p>

  <p>As per the rules of the second stage, a participant could get his rivals' points by destroying their pagodas. With this, Zheng glanced at his pagoda and saw the number of his points on it was increasing dramatically. He smiled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Out of twenty-two participants in the second stage, Zheng had already destroyed sixteen pagodas.</p>

  <p>If Zheng wanted, he could easily knock out all the other participants and occupy the three places to the main draw match all by himself. But, obviously, there was no need for him to do that.</p>

  <p>"Wait! I'm from the Violet Lustre Sect, a leading grade-three sect! Think about it! If you dare to knock me out, you'll become an enemy of our sect!" a cultivator in a purple robe shouted at Zheng.</p>

  <p>But just after he finished those words, a shining arrow shot out from Zheng's pagoda and wiped him out mercilessly. Zheng slyly smiled as if he was enjoying the threat.</p>

  <p>Like the man who was just recently wiped out, most of the remaining participants were from the grade-three sects. These grade-three sects weren't qualified to get a reserved slot to the main draw match by the World Commercial Alliance. Their disciples had to participate in the Martial Arts Contest as independent warriors.</p>

  <p>So, when they heard the man in purple threatened Zheng in the name of his sect, they thought of doing the same. After all, Zheng must be like them– afraid of the wrath of other disciples from grade-three sects. However, they didn't expect that Zheng would not hesitate to knock him out. It was as if Zheng intentionally did it to challenge the whole sect. They were even surprised that Zheng didn't care about the Violet Lustre Sect at all. Maybe he didn't know about Violet Lustre Sect? But that one was also impossible.</p>

  <p>After all, the Violet Lustre Sect was a leading grade-three sect. It was only one step away from being a grade-four sect like Bloodwood Cliff and Mysterious Luna Hall.</p>

  <p>"Your threats are useless!" Zheng announced in a cold voice. "Now, why don't we continue? The other two participants who will be part of the top three shall be decided by me! So, what can you offer in exchange for a slot?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"You want to sell the qualification to the main draw match?"</p>

  <p>"That's too unreasonable!"</p>

  <p>The other participants protested loudly with darkened faces. They had never thought that Zheng would use his position as an advantage. Though they didn't like it, some of them were already thinking about what to offer in exchange for the spot. Zheng was already assured of a spot in the top three after he defeated the other sixteen participants. They thought that Zheng would just stand aside as they fought with each other for the other two spots.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had surprised them once again when he offered to auction off the two remaining spots.</p>

  <p>They now believed that a conspiracy was happening in the contest. But instead of getting mad at Zheng, they could only curse the World Commercial Alliance which they believed manipulated the contest.</p>

  <p>Zheng's action nearly put Cole's nose out of joint when the latter saw that scene through the Picture Slab. He had never seen such an unreasonable act in their tests. Cole thought to himself, 'What does this damn guy think our test is? A place to profit from? He shows no respect to our World Commercial Alliance at all!'</p>

  <p>Michael was also flabbergasted with Zheng's action. He turned to Yudie with a forced smile, "I must say, I'm surprised to see how creative he is by auctioning off the remaining spots. But, is he really this desperate to get the money? Doesn't he get enough from you?"</p>

  <p>A faint smile crossed Yudie's face as she watched the calm look on Zheng's face. She didn't answer Michael's question. Besides, Michael wouldn't believe even if she told him how rich Zheng really was.</p>

  <p>Although Yudie herself wasn't sure how rich Zheng actually was, she had a guess when the latter casually gave her one drop of Genuine Dragon blood.</p>

  <p>"I won't force you. If you don't want it, then fine. But I have to tell you, I'm not a very patient person," Zheng said impatiently. He could just easily wipe out all the other participants with a wave of his hand. His arrows could easily knock them down, but he chose to give them a chance.</p>

  <p>At a distance from him, two cultivators at the middle level of Internal Elixir Realm were busy communicating with each other by sending messages with life vitality.</p>

  <p>They had already noted Zheng's presence when he came to the test venue, but they had ignored him. Besides, what could one expect from a cultivator at level three of Illuminating Soul Realm? But their ignorance and arrogance brought them all to a situation they could no longer escape.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? What about trying to kill him with all our strength?</p>

  <p>We have a chance of winning if we all launch an all-out attack at the same moment!" one of them said with confidence.</p>

  <p>His companion shook his head slightly and replied, "Each archer on his pagoda has the same power as a cultivator of Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Even if we try our best, there is only twenty percent possibility that we can succeed. It isn't worth a try."</p>

  <p>"He is very decisive, and he shows no hesitation even when he hears about the Violet Lustre Sect. It's useless to threaten him with our sect. What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Let's compromise with him first. He might be a very promising talent. We can stifle him in the cradle if we encounter him in the main draw match!"</p>

  <p>A hint of cruelty flashed in their eyes as they exchanged glances. One of them then bowed to Zheng with cupped hands and said, "Please wait a minute!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was growing impatient, but he had to give them a chance. He turned to them and said with a sarcastic smile, "Tell me, have you made up your mind? What are you offering?"</p>

  <p>The man pointed at his companion and explained, "We both come from the Platanus Sect. If you give the other two places to us, we'll pay you 50 supreme life vitality crystals each. How do you like it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around with disappointment and said loudly, "50 supreme crystals for a place in the main draw match. Any more bids?"</p>

  <p>One supreme life vitality crystal was equal to one million low-grade life vitality crystals hence 50 supreme crystals were already a large amount of money even to a cultivator of Internal Elixir Realm. So, the participants were surprised when they sensed that Zheng wasn't thrilled at all.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the palace, Cole almost hit the ceiling, "God! Is this really happening? Is he really holding an auction?"</p>

  <p>Yudie's lips curled into a smile, "An auction, how creative. Isn't that very interesting?"</p>
