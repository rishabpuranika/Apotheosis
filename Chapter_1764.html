  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You're threatening me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked incensed.</p>

  <p>However, the Divine Flame Cauldron was dead silent. No matter what Luo Luo Zheng asked, there was no reply...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to call out to the cyan dragon, but he didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng, what has happened to you?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Mu Ning call his name, he opened his eyes, his face lined with worry.</p>

  <p>Of course, she did not know that Luo Luo Zheng was arguing with the Genuine Dragons in his mind. All she could see was that Luo Luo Zheng was sitting with his eyes closed and his face was twisted in anger.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I'm fine." Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath and exhaled deeply.</p>

  <p>Right now, the nine Genuine Dragons in his mind were constantly bickering with each other.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you being a little too cruel to Luo Luo Zheng, brother?" the cyan dragon complained.</p>

  <p>As the first Genuine Dragon to wake up, the cyan dragon had been with Luo Luo Zheng for the longest period of time. However, his eldest brother forbade him to respond to Luo Luo Zheng, so he had no choice but to grudgingly follow his orders.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon was the only one of his kind in the Genuine Dragon World and his bloodline was the rarest. He had absolute authority and wisdom, so the cyan dragon would not dare to disobey him because of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This still isn't cruel enough!" remarked the Five-clawed Golden Dragon.</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment before continuing, "The things that he will face in the future are far more cruel than what he's up against right now..."</p>

  <p>"But we are still complementary to each other. We still need to rely on him to return to the Genuine Dragon World," said the sixth oldest dragon.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon smiled faintly and said, "Luo Zheng's matter is much more important than us returning to the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>What matters is that he should be able to go further, even if we nine brothers cannot return and perish here!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the eight Genuine Dragons fell silent when they heard this.</p>

  <p>Their eldest brother was right. They had to think about the big picture.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was much more important than them.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position had done a lot of things in the face of danger this time.</p>

  <p>Not only did they have to rely on the power of the nine dragons, they also had awakened the kylin boodline of the Xuanyuan Clan and at the same time, they had reached an agreement with Lone's sword.</p>

  <p>These ten Godly Geniuses carried important responsibilities on their shoulders. When they stood out of the universe, they were already carrying the destiny of the universe with them.</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords had formed an alliance and begun to carry out the first stage of the Celestial Position's plan, which was to exterminate the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>However, these Supreme Lords hadn't returned yet when the crisis broke out in the universe.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Lotus World was the most beautiful supreme world in the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>There were only two tenth grade sacred places in this supreme world and the Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place was the world lord of the Cyan Lotus World.</p>

  <p>People were panicking in the universe now. Eight world lords of the Humanity Alliance had died one after another. Supreme Lord Healum led his team to investigate this matter and they were constantly patrolling the supreme worlds...</p>

  <p>However, the world lords that had passed away all had one thing in common: they belonged to sacred places that were in the supreme worlds situated at the borders of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Lotus Sacred Place was located on the eastern side of the center of the Humanity Alliance. Relatively speaking, it could be considered the hinterland of the Humanity Alliance. Even if a crisis broke out, it would be hard to get to this area in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>However, the entire Humanity Alliance was under martial law and they had assigned more warriors to guard the exits and entrances of all the supreme world channels.</p>

  <p>On this day, in the core area of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place, the Saint Lord held a graver in his hand and was casually carving something on a mud wall.</p>

  <p>Seal carving was Saint Lord's way of calming his mind. It allowed his mind to get some peace. It was said that cultivating one's mind was equally important as cultivating one's body. Although he was already a world lord and the chances of him advancing further were very slim, he still hoped to reach an even higher level.</p>

  <p>As the graver in his hand continued to dance in the air, lotus leaves, lotus flowers, lotus seeds, ponds, and fish gradually appeared, forming a lifelike painting on the mud wall.</p>

  <p>"Dad!"</p>

  <p>A teenage boy with an attractive personality jumped down from a pavilion on the side.</p>

  <p>The boy was the youngest son of the Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place. Although he was only thirteen years old, his cultivation had already reached the Internal Elixir Realm. He was extremely talented.</p>

  <p>Extraordinary as the child was, the Saint Lord couldn't help but sigh in his heart, 'My son was born ten years too late...'</p>

  <p>With such talent, the boy must have been blessed by the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>However, he was born ten years late, so he did not have the chance to compete in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>"Have you finished your morning exercises, Dominic?"</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place asked flatly, as he continued to work on the painting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dad! I've cultivated the Cyan Lotus Step today and have got some insights on it. I think I have grasped the difference between the motion and stillness of this cultivation method," replied the young lad.</p>

  <p>A glimmer flashed in the Saint Lord's eyes before it dimmed.</p>

  <p>He was eight hundred years old when he grasped the difference between motion and stillness of the "Cyan Lotus Step". The talent of Dominic was probably no worse than that of the ace talents in the universe. It was truly a pity that he was not born at the right time?</p>

  <p>"You are awesome, Dominic! Your talent is rare even in the Humanity Alliance, and more so in the Cyan Lotus World?"</p>

  <p>As he was praising his son, a strange expression appeared on his face. He could feel the vibrations of the Cyan Lotus World.</p>

  <p>As the world lord of the Cyan Lotus World, he had the ability to control a world. This gave him special powers through which he could sense the fluctuations of space within the whole supreme world.</p>

  <p>The vibrations seemed to indicate that powerful warriors had torn apart a certain space of the Cyan Lotus World.</p>

  <p>Ordinary space cracks would not normally catch his attention. However, if a large number of space cracks appeared in a very short period of time, it would be able to cause such severe vibrations.</p>

  <p>'Has some beast appeared? No, that can't be right...' the Saint Lord mused.</p>

  <p>"Dad, what's wrong?" The boy had never seen this bizarre expression on his father's face before.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus World casually tossed the graver away and it got nailed to the mud wall. "Dominic, I have some urgent matter to attend to. I'll be right back?"</p>

  <p>Then he transformed himself into a streak of light and shot up towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Dad! Dad..."</p>

  <p>Dominic was bewildered. So without any hesitation, he, too, flew off to follow his father.</p>

  <p>He was no match for his father at flying in the sky, and soon he lost track of his father. However, he continued flying in the direction where his father had disappeared.</p>

  <p>After flying for a long time, he saw that there seemed to be some black objects in the distant sky. They were like streaks of lightning, which had descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>When he approached it, he discovered that his father along with powerful warriors from the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place were all gathered. And the black streaks of lightning were actually space cracks that extended all the way from the sky to the ground!</p>

  <p>'Such huge space cracks!' Dominic was astonished. It seemed as if the heavens and earth were going to be ripped apart by these space cracks!</p>

  <p>His expression quickly changed from bewilderment to fear.</p>

  <p>He stared open-mouthed as many monsters appeared from within the space cracks. Their shapes were as horrible as jagged mountains, and they looked even more terrifying than the most vicious beasts.</p>

  <p>Even the Saint Lord's expression was extremely grim.</p>

  <p>As the world lord of the Cyan Lotus World, he often traveled through spaces and sometimes when he built space tunnels he would reach the backside of space. This cursed Shadow Race wasn't unfamiliar to him.</p>

  <p>He had encountered them before a few times.</p>

  <p>However, the Shadow Race, also known as the sorcerer race, was extremely enigmatic and powerful. Killing them would unleash horrid curses.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't casually provoke the sorcerer race. Moreover, the sorcerer race always lived in the shadows, and if they left the backside of space, they would suffer a huge attack from the curse of the gods. And now, the sorcerer race had emerged from the other side of the world. Seeing this, the Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place realized that they were in big trouble...</p>
