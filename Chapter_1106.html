  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, War King Wind, who had been watching the battle closely with his full attention, suddenly let out a long sigh.</p>

  <p>'This is a trial for Fiona, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Fiona had never gone out to practice and gain experience through real life fights, but that didn't mean she had never fought anyone. Ever since she had stepped into the nature level, her father had arranged for opponents to challenge her one after the other.</p>

  <p>Once Fiona was able to defeat an opponent of the same level as her own, he would arrange for stronger opponents. And she did not disappoint him. Once she had reached the third grade of nature level, she was already strong enough to defeat a warrior at the seventh grade of nature level.</p>

  <p>When she reached the tenth grade of nature level, she gained enough strength and experience to defeat an opponent at the seventh grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>From that moment onwards, she basically became capable of defeating any warrior whose cultivation level was an entire realm above hers.</p>

  <p>Now, since she had entered the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, she could easily deal with a warrior at the second grade of Life and Death Realm. In fact, it wouldn't be too surprising if she managed to outwit a warrior at the third grade of that realm too.</p>

  <p>However, these battles had all been pre-arranged just to train Fiona, and the players in such battles would stop before they hurt their opponent for real. She was a princess of Wind Divine Kingdom, and even if War King Wind wanted the warriors he called in to go all out, who would dare to harm her?</p>

  <p>This kind of experiential learning, after all, did not put her on the border of life and death. Facing Luo Luo Zheng now was also a big test for Fiona. War King Wind hoped that his beloved daughter would make the right decision, so that he wouldn't lose too much face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry when he heard Fiona begging him to admit defeat. However, as a warrior, giving up was not an option.</p>

  <p>After laughing for a moment, he replied, "I won't admit defeat even if you beg me."</p>

  <p>Fiona was at a loss as to what to do next. She looked around searching for someone else's advice. When her gaze landed on her father, he closed his eyes. As a concerned father who wanted her to make her own way in the world, he did not want to give his daughter any hints at this point in time.</p>

  <p>Of course, since he did not say anything, numerous other warriors came up with some ideas of their own.</p>

  <p>As the many warriors of the Wind God Kingdom saw the expression on Fiona's face, they began to shout out loud.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, you can just kill him. This brat doesn't know how to appreciate favors. You showed him mercy, but he didn't appreciate it at all! Just kill him and be done with it!"</p>

  <p>'Kill him?' Fiona bit her lips and quickly stopped herself from pondering over such an idea. Ever since she could remember being herself, she hadn't even killed an ant.</p>

  <p>When she had reached the nature level, she could feel the existence of every single living thing in the world. When she walked on grass, she would be extremely careful, fearing that she would step too hard on the grass and hurt it. If there were ants or grasshoppers on the road, she would carefully avoid them as well.</p>

  <p>How could she be expected to kill someone now? Even if she herself was going to be killed, she wouldn't be able to do it.</p>

  <p>Her mental strength was still too weak to take such a powerful decision.</p>

  <p>As she panicked, her eyes reddened and crystal-clear tears began to roll down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the numerous divine-level talents of Wind Divine Kingdom felt their hearts shatter. These people were her admirers and wanted to impress her. How could they possibly tolerate someone making her cry? At that moment, almost all of them began to hate Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo, you are not a match for the princess at all. Don't be a scoundrel. Just admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>"Be a man! Don't act so shamelessly! You're embarrassing all of us!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and admit defeat! If you don't admit defeat, I will definitely kill you!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the warriors of Wind Divine Kingdom began to clamor.</p>

  <p>Just then, the little monster, who had been sleeping soundly till now, suddenly turned around and roared at these divine-level talents. "Stop making such a fuss! I am trying to sleep here! You disturbed my sweet dreams! Hey, girl! What's your name? I can't remember it. Anyway, if you don't want to kill him, then just knock him out. You are such a silly woman! This is so simple!"</p>

  <p>The roar of the little monster had angered the masses. Although he was very powerful, he could not fight against so many divine-level talents of the Wind Divine Kingdom. Therefore, everyone who had been roared at just now could not help talking back.</p>

  <p>However, the little monster's suggestion did make some sense and silenced these divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>"That's right. I didn't think of that. Your Highness, just knock out Tianxing Luo!"</p>

  <p>"Knock him out, and you will win!"</p>

  <p>Fiona's eyes lit up at this suggestion. She might not be able to kill Luo Luo Zheng, but she could still barely knock him out.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she smiled faintly at Luo Luo Zheng. "Since you're so adamant on not admitting defeat, then I'm sorry, I have to knock you out!"</p>

  <p>When they heard Fiona's charming voice, every single person from the audience was immediately attracted to her. If such a beautiful woman was accompanied by such a voice, then she would be a fatal attraction to any man of any age.</p>

  <p>This time, Fiona gently floated forward and followed the same pattern.</p>

  <p>She used the Time Law to reduce the time flow rate around her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still looked as defenseless as ever. He stood there in a daze as he watched Fiona approach him at an imperceptible speed.</p>

  <p>The princess circled behind Luo Luo Zheng as she began her plan of knocking him out. Her jade-like hand suddenly turned into a knife as it chopped towards the back of Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>However, just as she was closing in on Luo Luo Zheng, something happened!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's movements, which had originally been sluggish like a snail's under the influence of Fiona's Time Law, suddenly sped up quite a bit.</p>

  <p>Although his speed couldn't keep up with Fiona's, it was enough for him to protect the back of his head.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Fiona's palm strike landed on Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like a ball as he was sent flying forward once again. This time, because of his protection, he was not injured. With a smile on his face, he shook his aching arm and returned to normal.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Fiona's face revealed a strange expression. "Your...your movements just now...They were so quick! How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>She had completely comprehended the first layer of Time Law, and was able to adjust the time flow rate within a circumference of 100 feet.</p>

  <p>Using her powers, she could slow down time within that radius.</p>

  <p>A second of time passed in the outside world, but a hundred seconds passed within the area under the Time Law.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why Luo Zheng's speed had become as slow as a snail.</p>

  <p>After having been slowed down a hundred times, no matter how fast Luo Luo Zheng tried to be, his movements were still extremely slow compared to his opponent. That being the case, how was he able to block Fiona's attack?</p>

  <p>Just now, he had not only protected the back of his head, but his speed had also increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>It was as if Luo Luo Zheng had forcibly increased his speed by ten times.</p>

  <p>This was impossible!</p>

  <p>And it wasn't because the Time Law had been stopped because Fiona could feel that there was still traces of it in the air around her. But it hadn't been released by her!</p>

  <p>"You've comprehended the Time Law? Just now?" Fiona had a stunned expression on her face.</p>

  <p>The war king, war emperor, and many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were also wearing shocked expressions on their faces. They had clearly seen what had happened just now and whatever it was, it should have been impossible.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been continuously beaten up and had no way of fighting back.</p>

  <p>This wasn't to say that he wasn't strong enough, but that the Time Law was too strong.</p>

  <p>With the Time Law in place, the advantage of fighting a warrior at the same level was unimaginably great. Luo Luo Zheng should have lost to Fiona very easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Turner thought that even if Luo Luo Zheng was defeated by Fiona, he would still protect him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Turner was curious about why Luo Luo Zheng didn't admit defeat.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he is afraid that if he loses, the Harlen Divine Kingdom would abandon him and let him fall into the hands of War Emperor York, '</p>

  <p>Turner thought. He even wanted to tell Luo Luo Zheng with his life vitality that he would still protect him even if he lost to Fiona. After all, she had comprehended the Time Law, and Turner didn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng could win.</p>

  <p>In fact, no one did. And since Luo Luo Zheng had been severely beaten by Fiona just now, Turner was feeling a bit pitiful. Just as Turner was about to stop Luo Luo Zheng, he saw Luo Luo Zheng dodge her attack!</p>

  <p>Now, Turner understood what Luo Luo Zheng was doing. This guy had actually comprehended Fiona's Time Law while he was fighting her.</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was that he seemed to have comprehended quite a few of it.</p>

  <p>War King Wind took a deep breath and then said, "We all know very well how difficult it is to comprehend the Time Law. I want to know whether this kid has really comprehended it during the battle just now, or was he already accomplished at it?"</p>

  <p>Scott, War Emperor York, Turner, as well as numerous other warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, were all immersed in deep thought.</p>

  <p>Time Law was one of the most difficult laws to comprehend. It was several times more difficult than the Space Law, and not a single person from the audience believed that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to comprehend it through the Time Law Power that Fiona had displayed in such a short period of time.</p>
