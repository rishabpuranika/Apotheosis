</p>

  <p>The power that Tianming displayed had impressed many Supreme Lords in the universe.</p>

  <p>All of them wanted to draw him over to their respective sides, but Tianming was a member of the Thoughtless Minds? the fact had the four great clans thrilled.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, Tianming suddenly made his way into the top five, something nobody was expecting.</p>

  <p>The moment Tianming's Soaring Snake moved, the Supreme Lords were left to ponder.</p>

  <p>Another sword beyond this universe had made an appearance.</p>

  <p>This meant that such a young warrior was likely to change the very fabric of the universe in the future.</p>

  <p>Nathan's eyes were brimming with worry as he watched the battle unfold.</p>

  <p>Since the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, this was the first time he had made such an expression.</p>

  <p>"Tianming is indeed very strong." Lawson couldn't help but laugh grimly.</p>

  <p>"You need to teach him a lesson!"</p>

  <p>With his calm demeanor, Nathan replied, "He has to defeat Luo Luo Zheng before facing me."</p>

  <p>"Humph! I doubt Luo Luo Zheng would defeat Tianming anyway." The mere mention of Luo Zheng's name put Lawson in a bitter mood.</p>

  <p>With the strength Luo Luo Zheng displayed against Shania, Lawson saw his strength in a whole new light.</p>

  <p>Of course, it wasn't just Lawson. The other tens of thousands of warriors outside the picture had the same mind on the matter.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng smashed Lawson into ashes in a single punch. Lawson couldn't help but feel sour every time he thought of this.</p>

  <p>After the battle ended, Kurt's figure appeared on the stone once again, with crossed knees and a calm look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Tianming's terrifying display of strength indeed made his state of mind waver.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was silently chanting a Buddhist scripture, holding back the power of the inner demon. He still needed to face his next opponent. Only by maintaining a calm state of mind would he be able to go any further.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the mysterious woman's voice resounded once again.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the round-robin battle set by this woman, there were three battles left.</p>

  <p>First, it was Luo Luo Zheng against Tianming, and then Nathan against Kurt. The victors of these two battles would then have to face each other.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng versus Tianming!"</p>

  <p>After the cold voice resounded, a warm smile surfaced on Tianming's face.</p>

  <p>Now, he knew what his mission was.</p>

  <p>The arrow of his destiny pierced through the universe, right into the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the universe, he had only one goal? to fight against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a flash of light on the stone, Tianming vanished from where he stood and appeared on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng also stepped onto the board.</p>

  <p>And as Luo Luo Zheng came into view, Tianming was filled with emotion.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had grown so fast in the past that Tianming could only look up to him.</p>

  <p>Now, he finally stood opposite Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And this time, Tianming had a seventy percent chance of winning this battle.</p>

  <p>All things considered, this was already an extremely high chance of winning.</p>

  <p>But Tianming didn't dare be the slightest bit careless. Luo Zheng's potential was terrifying in itself? Tianming was well aware that if he were to give his opponent a sliver of a chance, Luo Luo Zheng would most likely turn the tides in his favor.</p>

  <p>For a moment, both of them were silent. Then, Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "Draw your sword."</p>

  <p>To this, Tianming silently nodded his head. Then, the Soaring Snake was slowly unsheathed from its sheath. A brilliant silver light shone as a silver moon appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng had also pulled out his Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>The weapons between the two were not equal by any means.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was a first-rank divine weapon. Even while it was considered one of the best first-rank divine weapons and was even listed on the Spirit Tablet, Tianming's sword was a treasure that went beyond the Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>There was an undeniable large gap between the two.</p>

  <p>But a sword did not make a swordsman.</p>

  <p>Believing this, Luo Luo Zheng completely overlooked the fact.</p>

  <p>And so, the two swordsmen drew their weapons.</p>

  <p>Countless warriors in the universe had their eyes on them, holding their breath in anticipation.</p>

  <p>It was clear that an intense battle was about to unfold. No one wanted to miss a single moment.</p>

  <p>"Tianming should win this!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's sword strike defeated Shania, so it's indeed extraordinary. But Tianming can dodge it with his speed."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I think so too!"</p>

  <p>Tianming himself had judged that he had a seventy percent chance of claiming victory against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And almost ninety-nine percent of the onlookers believed that Tianming would win.</p>

  <p>During his fight against Kurt, Tianming had managed to give a shocking display of strength.</p>

  <p>At this point, people had already neglected Nathan, who was supposedly the top Godly Genius? they were already inwardly assigning that title to Tianming.</p>

  <p>Nathan had the Xuanyuan Clan, the strongest clan in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>It was even more powerful than the Hidden Spirit Temple.</p>

  <p>But one's family background wasn't the key point in determining their strength. Nathan might not be able to handle Tianming.</p>

  <p>Slightly wielding his Soaring Snake, Tianming made a ripple of light appear beneath his feet. This ripple of light circled him for a moment before following the board to where Luo Luo Zheng stood.</p>

  <p>The moment it spread out, Tianming took a step forward.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though he was traveling through light.</p>

  <p>He moved with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Tianming was charging towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And this time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't retreat.</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, Luo Luo Zheng sent forth a series of Nether God Shadows, which charged straight at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Nether God Shadows were basically Luo Zheng's avatars as they used all sorts of fist moves against Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>In the past, these Nether God Shadows could create some trouble for the enemies.</p>

  <p>But in this situation, Tianming merely waved his hand and a faint ripple appeared in the space before him.</p>

  <p>The Nether God Shadows advancing towards him were instantly shattered and dissipated.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Following the Nether God Shadows, countless rays of lightning like dragons appeared, ready to devour Tianming.</p>

  <p>In the face of these lightning bolts, Tianming didn't even bother to dodge them. Instead, with the momentum of a soaring dragon, he charged straight ahead.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake had already shot toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Cling!</p>

  <p>The two swords clashed.</p>

  <p>"You should probably use more power," Tianming stated calmly.</p>

  <p>Under this strike, a crack appeared on Luo Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>In front of the Soaring Snake, a first-rank divine weapon was merely a toy.</p>

  <p>"I will!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze turned extremely sharp.</p>

  <p>Piercing sword intent was shot out in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng struck out with the sword without hesitation.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, wrapped in sword intent, had the strength to compete head-on with the Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>But Tianming had only swung the sword abruptly, immediately blocking Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike, no one had been able to block him.</p>

  <p>It was too sharp, too cold-blooded.</p>

  <p>But Tianming did it like it was nothing.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Following a crisp sound, Tianming took three steps back, a faint smile surfacing on his face.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing is a very powerful move, but this sword strike is far from enough," he said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>By relying on the Gods-intimidating Strike alone, Luo Luo Zheng perhaps wouldn't have even been able to deal with Kurt, let alone Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll just have to do it again!"</p>

  <p>Turning slightly, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword slashed down once more.</p>

  <p>But Tianming merely raised his hand and deflected the strike with ease.</p>

  <p>There were two swords against each other.</p>

  <p>Without attacking, Tianming had strong defense with his speed.</p>

  <p>No matter how exquisite or sharp Luo Zheng's sword strike was, Tianming's sword swiftly blocked it in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Clank, clank, clank, clank!</p>

  <p>Both of their feet were nailed firmly to the board.</p>

  <p>The two swords intersected with clear, melodious sounds.</p>

  <p>At this moment, neither of them used much strength.</p>

  <p>It was purely a game of technology.</p>

  <p>But as it was, Luo Luo Zheng was always the attacker as Tianming was always on defense.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, every strike of Luo Zheng's sword had been completely countered by Tianming. Even after numerous strikes, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't posing any threat.</p>

  <p>This outcome wasn't a surprise for many of the martial artists.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng's sword skill was indeed formidable, even he had a limit. No matter how profound his moves were, Tianming managed to block them instantly.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Luo Zheng had made a hundred attacks, the tables were somehow turned.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng's long sword trembled and started drifting erratically.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that he couldn't deal with Tianming with his regular attacks.</p>

  <p>Tianming was too fast, after all. He could see through Luo Zheng's sword strikes and block them with ease.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to change his strategy. It was time for him to abandon his usual sword strikes.</p>

  <p> </p>
