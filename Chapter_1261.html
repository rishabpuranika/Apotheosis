  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yes, sex was nice but it wasn't incentive enough for men to enter the Soul Enchanting Building where few souls dare to tread.</p>

  <p>Why? Because no matter how much pleasure one experienced in life, it would all be for nothing if he ended up dying from too much.</p>

  <p>The women in the Soul Enchanting Building had no need to force anything on anyone. Their top-tier flirtation skills were enough to make any man never want to leave. Once caught under their spell, the men would indulge themselves in the sins of the flesh non-stop, until their bodies were drained and their life vitality greatly depleted. All their hundred or even thousand years of hard work and cultivation would all be taken away. The danger of damaging one's core power was high and the worst that could happen was death.</p>

  <p>There was no way Mu Ning would join such a place. It was true that she wanted a man but that man was Luo Luo Zheng and Luo Luo Zheng alone.</p>

  <p>The Purple Jade Building, on the other hand, was a place where love was forbidden which she would also never accept.</p>

  <p>'I was tricked by that wicked old man?' she brooded resentfully. What should she do now? She was already here.</p>

  <p>How would she be able to escape with these two people in front of her?</p>

  <p>She briefly wondered if she could use the space node to escape and go back to the Central Region. However, what if she brought trouble to Luo Luo Zheng? This was truly a tight spot she found herself in.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as these questions rushed through her mind, Leah and Krista began arguing.</p>

  <p>The two bickered persistently, opposing each other as both were unwilling to give way. Mu Ning had a first-rank Purple Power Body, a very valuable asset for whoever got her as a disciple, so neither of them were willing to lose. Just as their arguing turned into screaming, an old and dignified voice called out, "Will the two of you go away!"</p>

  <p>Both Leah and Krista froze, their argument forgotten as an old woman walked into the scene.</p>

  <p>The woman wore a solemn expression on her face and held a cane in her hand.</p>

  <p>Despite having shouted at each other wildly just moments before, both Leah and Krista immediately composed themselves and extended a respectful greeting to the old woman, "Elder Apeiron!"</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World had three renowned buildings and a famous tower. One was the Purple Jade Building, the second was the Soul Enchanting Building, and the third was the Moon Building. But the one that held the absolute power over all of them was the Apeiron Tower!</p>

  <p>The old woman in front of them was none other than the tower's owner: Elder Apeiron!</p>

  <p>The old woman hobbled slowly towards Mu Ning with the help of her cane. "Good, very good! That old fellow has found a good disciple for me!"</p>

  <p>Krista's eyes immediately widened at the old master's words, "Elder Apeiron, I was the one who found her first?" she whined. There was no way she was giving up someone as special as Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>Leah chuckled beside her. "So what if you found her first? She obviously doesn't want to join your Purple Jade Building to become a nun!"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron snorted, "You were the first?" She gave Krista a cold glare before turning to Mu Ning and smiling warmly at her, "Little girl, give me your right hand."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was completely lost. There was no way she was going to be rash in calling anyone her master. Nevertheless, she extended her right hand timidly towards the old lady.</p>

  <p>On her palm was a special locating rune that belonged to the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Leah and Krista finally understood why Elder Apeiron had claimed Mu Ning as her disciple. Even if she herself was not a member of the Celestial Position, her husband was an important member of the race.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron looked at Krista and asked, "Do you see it? Do you still need me to explain?"</p>

  <p>Krista shook her head in embarrassment. "No need, Elder Apeiron. I didn't know you have already claimed her before us."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Elder Apeiron huffed, before turning to Mu Ning with a smile. "Little girl, my old man asked you to learn from a master, and that master is me."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning pursed her lips. The earlier ruckus with Leah and Krista had made her lose hope of ever finding a master but the sudden appearance of this old lady revived the determination in her veins. It was only through the help of a master would she be able to improve her cultivation and stand proudly by Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>She continued to ask with a vigilant look, "You? Can I think about my man if I take you as my master?"</p>

  <p>The question baffled Elder Apeiron, not really getting what Mu Ning meant at first.</p>

  <p>Leah, who had been standing in the sidelines, burst into laughter. "Ha-ha! This beautiful girl looks virtuous but I bet she has some traits that she could develop better in our Soul Enchanting Building. It seems our place is more suitable for you!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's face flushed beet red. "No, no, no. I didn't mean that!" The argument between Leah and Krista earlier had muddled her head and now she didn't know what she was saying. She couldn't believe she asked such a thing to a potential master.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that Elder Apeiron seemed to have understood her heart. She chuckled lightly and patted Xi Youqin's hand. "My old man has already told me all about you. I know that you originally had no interest in further advancing your cultivation but now you want to practice martial arts for that man. There won't be many restrictions if you become my disciple. However, advancing will be heavily dependent on your belief and determination. Your perseverance will be rewarded if you can bear through the end for that person..."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was greatly relieved at what she heard. If it was for him, then she would never lose sight of her goal. She nodded enthusiastically. "I can!"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron smiled. "Very good. Since that's the case, follow me into the tower."</p>

  <p>"Now? Can I wait?" She had come here to find a master but she did not want to immediately enter the Apeiron Tower. Luo Luo Zheng had just recently returned to the Central Region and she wanted to spend more time with him.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron nodded her head. "Of course. You can come whenever you want! However, you have to follow me to the Apeiron Tower right now so that when you come back, you can directly enter the space node and arrive at the tower's entrance."</p>

  <p>The first time a Purple Power Body warrior entered the Purple Power World, the space node through which the warrior entered was entirely random but could be easily changed so that the next time she came in, she could enter from the point where she left. Elder Apeiron wanted to change her space node to the place near the Apeiron Tower.</p>

  <p>"Okay!" she immediately agreed. A self-satisfied smile made its way on her face. Elder Apeiron seemed like a kind and amiable person so Mu Ning felt that she could have much leeway once she became her disciple.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The couple back in their chamber had spent a romantic night.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stretched her well-proportioned body lazily and lay on Luo Zheng's side, staring at his peaceful sleeping face.</p>

  <p>Their night had been eventful. The two of them had spent the entire night tangled together in the throes of passion and neither of them had gotten a wink of rest.</p>

  <p>She shuffled towards Luo Zheng's chest, curling her body towards him, "Are you asleep?"</p>

  <p>Her small frame molded perfectly with his and she felt as if she was lying down on a large, wooden boat in the middle of a peaceful ocean.</p>

  <p>Realizing that Luo Luo Zheng was only pretending to sleep, she mischievously raised her hand to pinch his nose.</p>

  <p>Just before she could reach it, Luo Luo Zheng immediately grabbed her hand at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pouted cutely. "You're so annoying. Let go of me!"</p>

  <p>But how could Luo Luo Zheng let her go? He smiled and pulled her closer to his tight embrace.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, last night you?" she started to protest once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed, interrupting her before she could finish her words, "Don't mention that. You almost froze me!"</p>

  <p>"You deserved it! You were so naughty! Be like that again and I'll freeze you to death!" she teased.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of being frozen. If you don't believe me, maybe we should do it again?" He laughed suggestively.</p>

  <p>"No way! Do you think I'm an idiot?"</p>

  <p>The morning was filled with soft touches and cheerful laughter. This went on for a while until they had to get up and bathe. Ning Yudie put her hair up in a bun, revealing her small and tender earlobes. After marriage, it was customary for the bride in the Central Region to tie her hair up in a bun for three days after the wedding day. The hairstyle changed her usual cheerful and playful look into that of a dignified young woman.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, made his way straight for the old man's place.</p>

  <p>The mysterious old man still hadn't left Cloud Hall and Luo Luo Zheng had yet to figure out what he came here for.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall had arranged a tea house for the old man to rest in. Luo Luo Zheng found him drinking tea leisurely once he arrived.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng respectfully bowed before him just after entering. The old man chuckled as he saw another figure fly over from outside the tea house. It seemed that Mu Ning had also returned.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found it weird to see Mu Ning look so worn out as if she had just returned from a terribly long journey. Did she leave Cloud Hall yesterday? Where could she have gone to?</p>

  <p>He remembered the old man talking to Mu Ning yesterday and now she rushed over here so early in the morning. Did something happen between the two? Luo Luo Zheng wondered curiously.</p>
