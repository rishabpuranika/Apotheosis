<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2064 Marko And Mateo (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Thanks to Zheng's valiant effort, Wynn suddenly found himself with a grace period in front of him. He used this time wisely and managed to get himself free.</p>

  <p>At first, Wynn had underestimated Pranav's strength. They were both low-rank True Gods, but Wynn's cultivation level was slightly higher than that of Pranav. Logically, he should have prevailed in a battle against Pranav.</p>

  <p>The situation took an immediate turn when Pranav suddenly used the Five-element Energy Seal, though.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Energy Seal was one of the many mysterious skills of the Five Elements Godly Way. Although there were many True Gods who had learned the Five Elements Godly Way, only a small portion of them were actually capable and competent enough to unleash the Five-element Energy Seal. This was because the skill had special requirements on the user's physique.</p>

  <p>Once Wynn had been sealed by the Five-element Energy Seal, he was suddenly overwhelmed with anxiety and struggled aimlessly to break free.</p>

  <p>On the other hand though, he also understood that his mistake might actually bring an end to the battle between these two True Gods. There would have been enough time for Pranav to kill Wynn ten times over before he could escape from the Five-element Energy Seal.</p>

  <p>That was when Luo Zheng had miraculously appeared at his side anew and used the Wishing Spell to hold Pranav back.</p>

  <p>Moved with surprise, Wynn seized the moment to break free from the seal.</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds might only be enough time for a mortal to drink a glass of water but for Wynn, this was more than enough to save his own life.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his hand, five rays of starlight shot out, one from each finger and his thumb.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't the most proficient in the Five Elements Godly Way, he had cultivated the Grand Sealing Technique. The Five-element Energy Seal was only achieved through the interpromoting relation in the five elements. If Wynn wanted to break this Five-element Energy Seal, he would have to do just the opposite and utilize the restricting relation of the five elements.</p>

  <p>The five streaks of starlight that had shot out in succession from his hand were of different colors. They each respectively contained the power of Metal Law, the power of Wood Law, the power of Water Law, the power of Fire Law and the power of Earth Law.</p>

  <p>The five elements' powers in Pranav's five eyeballs generated with each other, while the five elements' powers in Wynn's five stars restricted each other. The five eyeballs rotated clockwise, while the five stars rotated counter-clockwise.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the five stars spun simultaneously and approached, they ultimately collided directly with the five eyeballs.</p>

  <p>Metal produced water and fire melted metal, thus the Fire Law star collided with the Metal Law eyeball.</p>

  <p>Water nourished wood and earth absorbed water, thus the Earth Law star collided with the Water Law eyeball.</p>

  <p>Wood fed fire and metal chopped wood, thus the Metal Law star collided with Wood Law eyeball.</p>

  <p>With his clever use of the mutual promotion and restraint between the five elements, Wynn successfully disengaged the Five-element Energy Seal. It only took him twenty-seven seconds to unravel the seal. During this time though, Pranav still had control over the small sword, the one he was wielding at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Pranav noticed something was wrong, he lifted his eyes only to see that Wynn had already managed to break free. Immediately, he flung into an uncontrollable rage.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he couldn't give a damn about Wynn anymore. Instead, he shouted loudly, "Marko! Mateo! Come out right now and take care of the old geezer for me! I'm going to chop this brat into thousands of bloody little pieces!" At the end of his declaration, he slapped his own chest in indignation. A crisp sound rang out as he shattered a jade plate that was used for summoning.</p>

  <p>Pranav's patience with Luo Zheng had finally reached its limit. Originally, he had planned to kill Wynn by himself, because he wanted to get all the credit and prove to his master that he was strong. Now though, things had changed. He was so angry, so livid, that he only had one thought in his mind: to shred Luo Zheng apart.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Following his first order, he immediately called for the four small swords to turn around and slash toward Luo Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>Previously, Pranav had held Luo Zheng to a draw with only a single small sword. Now that the other four swords had equally circled over, Luo Zheng immediately felt the increased pressure. After all, the Five-element Divine Sword formed by the five small swords could really be used to kill a True God!</p>

  <p>With just a single round of attacks from the five small swords, Luo Zheng was already in great danger. His Great Weighty Sword was scarred by the Five-element Divine Sword and many bloody wounds instantly appeared all over his body. Had his body been any less strong and resistant, he would have already been torn to shreds.</p>

  <p>Wynn had successfully struggled his way out of the Five-element Energy Seal and therefore, there was no way he was just going to stand by and watch Luo Zheng die.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to take action in assisting Luo Zheng though, two new figures enveloped in incandescent light suddenly appeared before him, completely out of the blue. As the incandescent light slowly faded, two individuals with careless smiles on their faces were revealed. One of them looked Wynn up and down, while the other mocked Pranav, "Hey, Pranav, didn't you say that you could handle it all by yourself? Tell us, why have we been summoned, then?" one of the newcomers was asking, chuckling ironically.</p>

  <p>These two individuals were known as Marko and Mateo. They were the other two True Gods that came from the Murphy Universe. Just like Pranav, they were also Holy Murphy's disciples. With three True Gods standing against them now, how could Luo Zheng and his companions ever hope to win this war?</p>
