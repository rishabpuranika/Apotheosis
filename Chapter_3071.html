  <p>
</p>

  <p>"There is a huge wave coming at us from ahead!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as he pointed towards it, looking at Dorothy with a worried expression.</p>

  <p>Dorothy turned the Truth Boat slightly and skillfully avoided the wave in front of the boat. "How high is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Over a hundred feet high," Zheng answered as he furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng, with all his skills, could not avoid such a strong wave. If he and his boat came in contact with it, they would both perish.</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy remained calm and said, "Don't worry. The people ahead will tell us the duration of the wave."</p>

  <p>"The duration? What do you mean?" Zheng narrowed his eyes, looking puzzled.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a loud voice enunciated from a boat ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"The wave ahead is a hundred and thirty feet high! It will last for about twelve seconds!"</p>

  <p>"About twelve seconds! If you don't want to die, get ready!"</p>

  <p>"About twelve seconds!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy shouted at the people in their boats behind her. They passed the information this way from one boat to the other. Soon every warrior in their respective Truth Boats was alerted about the wave.</p>

  <p>Dorothy then turned to Zheng and instructed him, "The width of this wave is limited. When it rolls up in front of us, we can retreat. Then we can return to the sea after twelve seconds!"</p>

  <p>After listening to her, Zheng heaved a sigh of relief as his tensed expression relaxed.</p>

  <p>If one retreated from the Sea of Truth temporarily, their boats would disappear with them. And when they returned to it, they would appear in the same place they left. It was like hiding in a different space to avoid the wave.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea," said Zheng as he nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled and said, "The creatures have thought of many ways in order to reach the Other Shore. This is the first wave, but it won't be the last. You must be careful."</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng saw the giant wave roll up towards the Truth Boats. The boats began to disappear one by one. It was obvious the warriors had left the Sea of Truth till the wave receded.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the giant wave raged forward towards Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry...</p>

  <p>Come closer!</p>

  <p>We can leave once the wave gets close enough,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy uttered as she stared at the giant wave in front of them in anticipation. Although avoiding the wave was not a difficult task, the timing was important.</p>

  <p>"Now! Let's go!" Dorothy exclaimed in a crisp voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng reacted to Dorothy and quickly activated the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>Just as the giant wave was about to crash onto him, he disappeared along with his boat.</p>

  <p>Under his flag, he slowly opened his eyes when he sensed no impact from the coming wave.</p>

  <p>A while ago, he was about to get hit by a strong wave that was capable of killing him. And now, he was at the outskirts of the Dragon City. The atmosphere was peaceful, and everyone was cultivating quietly. Feeling relieved, he let out a deep breath. His mind wandered off to Dorothy and the other warriors who crossed the Sea of Truth with him. He wondered if they had retreated in time to avoid the wave.</p>

  <p>"One, two, three, four..."</p>

  <p>Zheng began counting down the seconds under his breath. After he mouthed twelve, he composed himself, activated the Truth of Godly Way and returned to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>When he returned, he turned his head to look back subconsciously.</p>

  <p>The giant wave had already moved far away from him, but Dorothy's Truth Boat was still nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt his heart sink. He wondered if she wasn't able to retreat in time and the wave had washed her away.</p>

  <p>But soon, Dorothy and her Truth Boat emerged in the Sea of Truth. As soon as she appeared, she pointed at the small wave behind Zheng and said, "Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a sudden jolt under the boat and his Truth Boat almost toppled over as he struggled to maintain balance.</p>

  <p>"When you return to the Sea of Truth, you should look ahead first! If there was another huge wave, you would have been dead by now," Dorothy scolded Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I was worried that you failed to avoid the wave," Zheng responded with a hint of concern in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Even so, you shouldn't look back. It's normal for people to die out here.</p>

  <p>Even if I fail and die, you can't do anything about it," Dorothy said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Got it," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled to herself while looking at Zheng's back. Although she just warned him, she felt happy thinking he worried about her.</p>

  <p>After the first wave passed, they journeyed over a thousand feet till another wave approached them.</p>

  <p>"The second huge wave... This one's higher than the last..."</p>

  <p>After handling the first wave, Zheng no longer felt scared.</p>

  <p>As long as he timed the use of the Illusion Breaking Rune right, he could evade the wave with ease.</p>

  <p>"This wave is a hundred and seventeen feet high!"</p>

  <p>"It will last about eighteen seconds..."</p>

  <p>"Eighteen seconds..."</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy studied the forthcoming wave, left the Sea of Truth and returned to it after the passing of eighteen seconds.</p>

  <p>This continued as they sailed ahead. They encountered many waves that came and went...</p>

  <p>As they got closer to the Other Shore, the huge waves grew in size and height.</p>

  <p>In this process, many people failed to master the timing. Some were unfortunate enough to be swept up by the small waves that followed after they returned to the Sea of Truth. Thus, they all died.</p>

  <p>The number of people floating in the Sea of Truth reduced from over three thousand to about eight hundred.</p>

  <p>"It's a little strange... "It's hard to imagine over two thousand people have drowned in the Sea of Truth!"</p>

  <p>The number of boats floating on the Sea of Truth decreased sharply.</p>

  <p>"Some of them have left directly and given up on coming back," Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>"But they have to come back sooner or later. It would be more dangerous if they get involved in a giant wave when they come back," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled and said, "The Sea of Truth is calm for some time every two or three years. It will be safer to enter it during that period."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't people get to the Other Shore during that time?" Zheng felt confused. He didn't understand why anyone would risk their lives even if the Sea of Truth was calm for a certain period.</p>

  <p>"Because at that time, the boats can only retreat, and can't go forward."</p>

  <p>Dorothy shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>While they were immersed in talking, another huge wave rolled in front of them.</p>

  <p>As they continued their journey to the Other Shore, more and more people disappeared. Some of them had given up and some of them had died amidst the waves.</p>

  <p>They had encountered over a hundred huge waves along the way. But then, a frighteningly large wave rolled down in front of them. It was over six hundred feet high. When the wave passed, many boats had disappeared from the Sea of Truth. It was like silence had enveloped the sea as it became quiet with only about a hundred boats left.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a warm aura emitted from the sea. The original chill had long disappeared. Standing on the Truth Boats, the warriors sensed something warm and dry.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng and Dorothy heard cheers coming from the boats ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Some of the people were jumping with joy and some of them looked relieved as they lay flatly on their boats without a hint of worry.</p>

  <p>The water of the Sea of Truth calmed down and the waves turned shallower than before...</p>

  <p>A golden beach came into view just several thousand feet away from where they were...</p>

  <p>"Have we... reached the Other Shore?" Zheng asked while staring at the beach.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have!" Dorothy replied with a faint smile. She took a deep breath as she closed her eyes and stood there, soaking in her surroundings.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't so hard..." Zheng thought the journey would be filled with many obstacles that would make it difficult for him to reach the Other Shore. He never expected them to arrive unscathed after passing those huge waves.</p>

  <p>Dorothy tilted her head and thought for a moment before replying, "It's not difficult, but during the process of moving to the Other Shore, if you misinterpret the timing and make a mistake, you'll die!"</p>

  <p>The water of the Sea of Truth threatened the Souls of Light so much that no one dared make a mistake while attempting to cross it.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The Truth Boats sailed to the beach one by one.</p>

  <p>One of the warriors aboard a Truth Boat jumped out excitedly, and his Soul of Light ran freely on the beach at full speed.</p>

  <p>Some even rolled on the golden beach to celebrate like it was the biggest achievement of their lives.</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped off the Truth Boat and looked around. The beach was empty.</p>

  <p>Apart from the golden sand, there were only a few stones lying around.</p>

  <p>"Where are the Other Shore Tokens?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng had imagined a huge pile of Other Shore Tokens lying around the beach. He thought anyone who crossed the Sea of Truth to reach the Other Shore could grab their Other Shore Tokens. Now he felt disappointed as he didn't see any of them.</p>

  <p>"They are under your feet!" Dorothy said excitedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked at her in confusion. He focused on the sand underneath his feet and asked, "Do you mean... the sand is the Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Dorothy nodded enthusiastically. "It is the most common Other Shore Token. It's called Crimson Golden Sand," Dorothy said. She didn't seem like she was joking about this.</p>
