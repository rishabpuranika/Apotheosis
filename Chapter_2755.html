<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2755 Luo Zheng's Arrogance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The wind rushed by making a soft whirring sound like a propeller blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had flashed through several layers of fire curtains and stopped in front of Liusu in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and, in a flash, got ahold of Liusu's head.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527! It's up to you!" This thought rolled around inside Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Both Liusu and Aleyna were the puppets of Samuel, meaning that they were the products between the human and the puppet.</p>

  <p>Their souls might still be intact, but their Memory Flames had disappeared.</p>

  <p>They only had small fragments of the Memory Flames. The memories were chaotic at best, and there were only glimpses of different cultivations. What had made them who they were was gone. They had no more personality.</p>

  <p>They were mindless, lifeless puppets.</p>

  <p>The only way to help them restore their memories was to force their Memory Flames back into their souls.</p>

  <p>Before that could happen though, they had to be rid of the choppy memories in their souls and escape from Samuel's control at the same time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not have the knowledge to perform any of that, so he had to hand that task off to No. 9527.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng had taken hold of Liusu's head, No. 9527 entered her mind.</p>

  <p>Liusu's soul was floating quietly, curled up into a ball.</p>

  <p>Behind her soul there was a pale yellow worm crawling along her back. Its face reflected the image of Samuel.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Samuel's face contorted into a scowl as he beheld the green ball of light, which was No. 9527, surprise flickering in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what it was exactly, he knew it was a threat to him. The surface of the parasite began to emit a soft, yellow light. When the light became almost too bright, it launched a soul attack at No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Samuel yelled.</p>

  <p>The light morphed into numerous soul thorns that spiraled towards the green ball of light.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 might be the lowest level as a soul body, and not very powerful, but it was still a part of the Chaos Ancient God's soul. It was easy for it to block against Samuel's soul worm.</p>

  <p>This attack with the yellow soul thorns was an extremely powerful move, which would be beyond the endurance of an ordinary consummate True God's soul.</p>

  <p>As the thorns reached the surface of the green ball of light, they simply bounced off. They left no damage and the ball did not react at all.</p>

  <p>There was a flash of light across the green ball's surface, and a light green tentacle formed in the center of the ball.</p>

  <p>The tentacle wriggled and shook until it transformed into a blade. It slashed through the air towards the pale yellow worm.</p>

  <p>There was a brief moment that stretched on for awhile before the worm split into two pieces and slipped from Liusu's back. As a soul it wasn't dead, so it attempted to escape. No. 9527 was faster though, and shot out the tentacle to entangle the worm in a vice like hold.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the struggle it put up, No. 9527 dragged the nasty thing into its own soul.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 did not need to strengthen itself, and normally the owner and the brain masters would not allow it.</p>

  <p>However, a field commander would sometimes have to decide against the king's orders. No. 9527 had gradually developed its own consciousness, so there were not so many restrictions on it anymore. There was simply no way it would pass up a chance to devour another soul.</p>

  <p>Besides, killing the worm meant severing the connection between Liusu and Samuel completely.</p>

  <p>"It is done."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 sent the thought to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It had only taken it three seconds to penetrate Liusu's mind, and kill the yellow parasite.</p>

  <p>Liusu had lost consciousness by that point, and her head drooped forward with glassy eyes staring at nothing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held on to her arm for a moment, waiting for No. 9527's soul to return to him. When he felt the soul return, Luo Zheng held onto Liusu and flashed away to catch Aleyna.</p>

  <p>Once he had her in his grasp, No. 9527 repeated the process.</p>

  <p>Aleyna's eyes had been blank with indifference, but the moment Samuel's control was gone, the indifference morphed into confusion.</p>

  <p>She had been the same as Liusu. Still with a soul but no the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and No. 9527 had released the two girls from underneath Samuel's control in quick succession. Only Pascal was left to be rescued.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could make a move towards his next target, Pascal had fled in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>"How could he do that?" Samuel whispered on the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>His face was dark and murderous.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Trapping Array set up by the three members of the Han Clan was one of their trump cards, but it had been easily broken. How could he accept that failure?</p>

  <p>The only thing he could do now was to make Pascal run away.</p>

  <p>If he was rescued by Luo Zheng as well, Samuel wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being, Samuel was unable to inherit the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he didn't want to lose control of his last puppet for that reason.</p>

  <p>Just as Samuel's worry skyrocketed thinking that Luo Zheng would catch up to Pascal, he caught sight of three others flying in the opposite direction of Pascal. His scowl darkened when he realized it was Jayden, Mathew and Raymond.</p>

  <p>"It would be okay if Luo Zheng does not disclose his identity, but if he does, it will get ugly," Samuel muttered, a hint of gloom flashing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He might not be afraid of Nicholas, but he didn't think it was good timing.</p>

  <p>He just hadn't gotten any real leverage yet.</p>

  <p>Above the black waters, the three Demi-holy Beings? Jayden, Mathew and Raymond? passed by Pascal.</p>

  <p>They glanced at him with a bored expression, and did nothing to stop him.</p>

  <p>They were not here for him after all. Their target was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He has proved himself to be a consummate True God who can beat ten alone. He actually dared break into the sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region. It's incredible!" Jayden said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>It was easy for them to catch up to Luo Zheng, thanks to the three members from the Han Clan, who had tried to stop him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng decided it best not to attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>He did not want to have to go deeper into the black waters.</p>

  <p>As long as the pursuers were only the Demi-Holy Beings, Luo Zheng felt he might have a chance if he fought them.</p>

  <p>"If you find it so amazing, perhaps you could just leave," Luo Zheng replied faintly.</p>

  <p>A faint light shone from Luo Zheng's cinnabar field as he spoke. He would put Aleyna and Liusu in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng took back their Memory Flames, they would be able to restore their original memories. For now they needed to be in a safe place.</p>

  <p>"I think it would be best if you present your hands for capture," said Mathew coldly, as he took a step forward and stared hard at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The three Demi-holy Beings knew they were strong enough to deter people from retaliating.</p>

  <p>All three of them, who were all top-level Demi-Holy Beings, were confident that they would win over a Holy Being let alone Luo Zheng. It was almost laughable seeing as Luo Zheng had only just reached the consummation of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>"You all want me to present my hands to you, and surrender to capture?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I'm afraid you're not strong enough."</p>

  <p>"How arrogant!"</p>

  <p>How could anyone expect Raymond to accept that kind of arrogance from a consummate True God? The killing intent swelled in his chest to an unbearable level.</p>

  <p>The moment Raymond revealed his killing intent, a ball suddenly appeared above Luo Zheng's head with a crackling sound.</p>

  <p>With what sounded like a breath from the ball, a Soul Suppressing Sword formed, startling even the Demi-Holy Beings. In an instant it flew towards Raymond.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the first Latent Theurgy began to work.</p>
