  <p>
</p>

  <p>The true secrets of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword lay within the shadow of the figure.</p>

  <p>The first time Luo Zheng had wielded the sword, he discovered this mystery and pondered over it for a long time.</p>

  <p>Each time he swung it, it would produce lightning and wind blade, and at the same time, a human figure would appear alongside them.</p>

  <p>Curiously, Luo Zheng felt that he had a connection to it.</p>

  <p>However, he had tried many times to control that figure, but he could not do so. Eventually, Xun came to the conclusion that perhaps a certain cultivation method existed to match this Thunder Wind Divine Sword. It might be very difficult for Luo Zheng to get knowledge of this method.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Zheng heard the words of the former leader of the palace, he raised his eyebrows and asked, "The mind method in relation to the Thunder Wind Divine Sword?"</p>

  <p>Kyron nodded. "It seems you've already tried to wield the sword. I'm afraid you won't be able to control the Nether God Shadow within it�"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've tried many times, but I couldn't grasp the technique," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"It is not something that you can master merely by trying," Kyron said as he took out a jade slip and handed it over to his disciple, Layla.</p>

  <p>Layla wanted to step forward and hand it to Luo Zheng, but with a quick thought, she gently tossed the jade slip in the air. The slip then flew toward Luo Zheng slowly.</p>

  <p>She didn't use her life vitality or any other method to throw the jade slip at him. Instead, she manipulated time in the space between her and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Time Law?" Luo Zheng smiled at this silently.</p>

  <p>In truth, this was only the first layer of the Time Law. Any martial artist who had comprehended the first layer would be able to do so, but Layla had used the Time Law in a clever manner. She had precisely calculated the distance between her and Luo Zheng to direct the law within the range.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that she did it to show off her skills.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had taken away the sword before her, and she was still unwilling to accept that. She wanted Luo Zheng to understand the chasm between him and her.</p>

  <p>Layla, in fact, did not care about the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. She knew her fate. As long as she did not die, she would be the star of this era. As the world of chaos slowly unleashed itself, she would eventually become one of the top warriors.</p>

  <p>As for this boy, Luo Zheng... he was nothing!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a trace of hostility coming from this woman in cyan. It left him a little baffled.</p>

  <p>Of course, he did not take this to heart.</p>

  <p>As the jade slip slowly flew toward him, it got slower once it reached halfway. Although it still moved forward, its speed was like that of an inchworm. If one did not look carefully, one would think that the jade slip was frozen mid-air.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng smiled as he took a step forward and stepped into the area where Layla was controlling the Time Law. He reached out and grabbed the jade slip.</p>

  <p>From beginning to end, the Time Law had no effect on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng had easily dealt with her Time Law, Layla bit her lip and asked him, "You'll participate in Passing the Torch, right?"</p>

  <p>"Passing the Torch?" Luo Zheng was momentarily stunned. "What is that?"</p>

  <p>Seeing how clueless he was, Layla said in a low voice, "You don't even know about Passing the Torch. You are indeed an ascended warrior�"</p>

  <p>Yolande patted his head and said to Luo Zheng, "Sorry, I forgot to tell you. You must participate in Passing the Torch."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. "I will, but first I want to know what it is."</p>

  <p>"Passing the Torch is a method to test one's potential in the thirteen palaces, and it is held once in a while," Yolande told him. After thinking for a while, she added, "You can compare it to the test at that tower of the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>The memories of the Tower of Sin were fresh in Yolande's mind.</p>

  <p>She had not forgotten that Luo Zheng had obtained the title of golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>He was one among the few who had gained such a great title in this grand era, so Yolande looked forward to his performance in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Layla, who was a disciple of the former leader of the palace, seemed to have some special skills. From her mildly disdainful glances, it seemed like she wanted to compete with Luo Zheng in Passing the Torch. She obviously overestimated herself, for she would be no match to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If the former leader of the palace knew that Luo Zheng had the title of golden Celestial Position, he would have asked Layla to give up immediately on this idea of defeating him.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande decided not to tell him about Zheng's title of golden Celestial Position. The girl was young and extremely talented, but Kyron always pampered her. As a result, she had become very conceited.</p>

  <p>Yolande, as a senior, did not like her arrogant manner and thought it would be a good opportunity to let Luo Zheng deflate her arrogance a bit.</p>

  <p>Of course, Yolande only instinctively felt that Layla was weaker than Luo Zheng, but the results remained to be seen. The universe was vast and there were many talents here. Unexpected occurrences were not unheard of. It would be interesting to see who performed better at Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see." Luo Zheng nodded before turning to the woman in cyan. "I will participate in Passing the Torch, but I don't know why you are so interested."</p>

  <p>Layla stared at Luo Zheng and said coolly, "I'll win and leave you far behind!"</p>

  <p>"And then?" Luo Zheng asked again, wearing a languid smile.</p>

  <p>Seeing his nonchalant expression, Layla decided not to answer him. She gave him a fierce glare and returned to her master's side.</p>

  <p>A strong smell of gunpowder was obvious between the two young talents. However, Kyron and Yolande just let them be. The world of martial artists had always been like this. Only through competition could one display his or her limits and potential.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shelved the matter of Passing the Torch for the time being. He held the jade slip in his hand and walked over to Kyron to extend his heartfelt thanks to him. The mind method was extremely useful to him, and since he had taken away this person's sword and received his mind method without giving him anything in return, Luo Zheng felt obliged to him.</p>

  <p>After he left Yolande's place, Luo Zheng learned more about Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Passing the Torch could indeed be used to test a martial artist's potential and talent, but its purpose was limited only to test.</p>

  <p>As for the Tower of Sin, also known as the Tower of Crystal, it was a place to temper a martial artist's fighting spirit. The Talent Tablet could be considered an important part of it. The tower was most significant to the cultivators as they fought and practiced there. Not only did one receive a good reward from Passing the Torch, but there were also some important human inheritances to be gained from it. Luo Zheng, of course, would not refuse to take the test and even looked forward to it.</p>

  <p>A few days later, in the great hall where he was staying, Luo Zheng stood holding the five-foot-long Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>With a light flick of his finger, he slashed the Thunder Wind Divine Sword and a ray of light shot into the sky.</p>

  <p>However, there were no lightning or wind blades within this light.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Zheng was in complete control of the first rank divine weapon and had temporarily filtered out the two types of Law Power. He had only activated the shadow of the figure inside.</p>

  <p>The mind method that the former leader of the palace had passed on to Luo Zheng was known as the 'Nether God Mind Method'. With this technique, a cultivator was able to control the 'Nether God Shadow' within the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>The first time he used the sword, the shadow only performed a barging fist. After days of training with the Nether God Mind Method, the movements of the figure had become much more complicated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The figure in the large hall rushed forward. After a confident stride, it turned and meandered ahead before doing a somersault and gradually dissipating into thin air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wielded the sword once again and another shadow of a figure shot out. A dense stream of fist radiance emerged from its hand. Within a short period of time, the shadow had performed an entire set of boxing movements before gradually disappearing again.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng drew back his sword slowly and fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>If a single strike was capable of producing a single Nether God Shadow, did that mean he would be able to make multiple Nether God Shadows if he swung the sword in successive motions?</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Zheng extracted a large amount of chaotic energy from his cinnabar field and let it gush into the long sword. Suddenly, killing intent clouded his eyes as he quickly brandished the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struck ten times in one breath.</p>

  <p>To an ordinary swordsman, it was not tough to thrust a sword so many times in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Zheng finished the ten strikes, ten Nether God Shadows appeared before him, each performing a different set of movements.</p>

  <p>If the original possessor of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, the former leader of Mist Palace, had witnessed this, he would have been dumbstruck. He had never imagined that someone would be able to use the Nether God Shadow successfully to this extent.</p>
