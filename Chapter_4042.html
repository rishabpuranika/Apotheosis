<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The white claw continued to scatter ashes.</p>

  <p>Soon, the emerald green leaves were covered with a layer of ashes again.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others stood still and carefully observed the movements of the claw.</p>

  <p>Even from afar, they were sure that it was a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>However, they noticed that the disgusting aura emanating from the creature was not as strong as those of the previous ones that they had faced.</p>

  <p>Although thick leaves were blocking their view, they could still make out its appearance. It was like a sluggish sloth that actually looked adorable.</p>

  <p>After the sloth-like Treacherous Being spread a layer of ashes on the plants, it jumped down from the branch and slowly approached Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>"What does it want to do now?" Fuxi asked as he stared at it warily.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Treacherous Being started walking towards them, Sawyer and Thurston instinctively took out the sand-sized Holy Stones. Just before they activated the stones, Pearson stopped them and looked at them while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>The sloth was just a hostility-level Treacherous Being and didn't impose any threat. Thus, Peterson deemed that it wasn't necessary to activate the Light of Annihilation just to frighten it.</p>

  <p>Zheng actually had the same thought in mind. He just stood still and watched the creature as it walked towards him.</p>

  <p>The creature suddenly stopped in front of Zheng. Then, it started pointing at the sky, showing a frightened expression.</p>

  <p>"What is it trying to say?" Zheng's brows furrowed as he didn't understand what it meant.</p>

  <p>"It's pointing to the sky with a frightened expression. Is there something in the sky that makes it scared? Or does it want some kind of help?" King Ieuan tried to make a guess.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked around before looking up in the sky. "It might be saying that there is a threat in the sky, but I don't think it wants any help."</p>

  <p>As a native of the place, the creature was much more familiar with the environment than them. Moreover, the fact that it was an immortal and had low intelligence meant that there should only be few things that could scare it.</p>

  <p>"If that's not the case, then does it want to help us instead? But I don't think that's more plausible," Yasamin said coldly as her eyes were glued to the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are different kinds of Treacherous Beings. Some like to possess other creatures, while others like killing. We can't rule out the possibility that there are types that are kind to others. For example, Campbell stands on our side after he fully awakened," the Snake Goddess explained with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that… These monsters are just— "</p>

  <p>Zheng hushed Yasamin before she could utter another word. He knew what everyone thought about the Treacherous Beings, but he also thought that the Snake Goddess was right. There were so few things that they knew about them, so they couldn't just conclude anything.</p>

  <p>After the sloth-like creature repeatedly pointed at the sky, it reached into a pouch in its abdomen. It was filled with the grayish-white ashes that it had been scattering. It grabbed a handful of the ashes and attempted to sprinkle them on Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>As a conditioned reflex, Zheng immediately stepped back to avoid the ashes.</p>

  <p>The creature sensed Zheng's vigilance upon its action, so it started pointing towards the sky again. Its eyes revealed a trace of sincerity as if pleading him not to avoid the ashes. Afterward, it walked towards Zheng again with some ashes in its hand.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a feathered arrow suddenly shot out from a distance.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The arrow gushed at an incredible speed, and it firmly nailed the ground just in front of the creature.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the arrow that instantly landed in front of it, the sloth-like creature was startled. It made a few somersaults and hurriedly climbed a tree.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Two arrows fired in rapid succession and shot towards the tree where the creature hid.</p>

  <p>Even with the thick forest blocking the shooter's view, the arrows that were shot landed accurately. They struck the trunk of the tree, and the creature was directly behind it.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The sloth-like creature quickly got down from the tree and rushed deeper into the forest to hide.</p>

  <p>Although they realized that the arrows were not aimed at them, Zheng and the others didn't let their guards down.</p>

  <p>With this, the three Eternal Realm Hunters dispersed and looked around.</p>

  <p>Deeming that it would be much faster to call out the one responsible for it, Fuxi yelled coldly, "Who shot those arrows? Show yourself right now!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a short creature emerged from the other side of the forest. His attributes were very similar to a human child's. His face was just a bit bigger than usual, but was actually good-looking. He could just be differentiated from humans because of his long green tail with a flat leaf-like end.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. I've just driven off the Treacherous Being," the short creature said.</p>

  <p>When everyone heard that he could speak the standard human language, their tensed bodies began to relax a little.</p>

  <p>The Night View Island was a very anomalous place. Though they hadn't encountered any extreme danger, they might instantly fall into a bad situation if they were not careful enough in this unknown environment.</p>

  <p>That said, it would be great if someone could be their guide.</p>

  <p>They immediately thought that he could be a big help since he looked so kind and sincere, and he also instantly helped them drive off the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your help and I apologize for yelling before." Fuxi cupped his hands and showed his gratitude to the creature.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome," he answered with an innocent smile. He then approached and sniffed them, saying, "Your auras are very unfamiliar. Are you perhaps from the outside world?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. We are from outside of the Night View Island," Fuxi replied with a nod. "Then, are you a native of the island?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm a member of the Wooden Leaf race. You can call me Decker," the creature said as he introduced himself. "It was fortunate that I was around.</p>

  <p>You were in grave danger just now," he continued.</p>

  <p>"Grave danger? Why?" The Snake Goddess was shocked at his statement that she couldn't help asking right away.</p>

  <p>"That Treacherous Being is evil," Decker said as he pointed towards the direction where the sloth-like creature ran off. "It wanted to sprinkle the Ghost Powder on you."</p>

  <p>"Ghost Powder? I've never heard of that. What does it do?" the Snake Goddess curiously asked again.</p>

  <p>The smile on Decker's face instantly vanished as he started explaining,</p>

  <p>"Every night, certain creatures will come down from the sky. They will come here and devour all the living things that are sprinkled with the Ghost Powder."</p>

  <p>When they heard this, there was a variety of expressions that appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>Some frowned, while others raised their eyebrows. Some eyes widened, and some mouths opened.</p>

  <p>Zheng was one of the most shocked because his feet were almost sprinkled with the Ghost Powder. The three Eternal Realm Hunters exchanged glances with each other.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tried to remain calm and continued asking, "These creatures that you're pertaining, are they Treacherous Beings too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're correct. They are the powerful hatred-level Treacherous Beings," Decker said with a straight face.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Did you just say hatred-level Treacherous Beings?!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't able to keep his composure.</p>

  <p>All of them were utterly shocked. No one could hide their surprise and anxiety as they heard what Decker said.</p>

  <p>In the last Pure Sky Platform, they happened to face a resentment-level Treacherous Being. If it weren't for Zheng's explosive power at the most critical moment, they would have been dead already.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an understatement to say that they just got lucky to surpass that hurdle. They were not even sure if they could successfully beat a resentment-level Treacherous Being next time. Now, if it was true that hatred-level Treacherous Beings would come and assault them, there probably was a zero chance of them surviving.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, King Ieuan, Yasamin, and the others took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>They were relatively close to the part of the forest where the sloth-like creature sprinkled the Ghost Powder. Knowing that it could attract the hatred-level Treacherous Beings, they had to make sure that they had absolutely no contact with it.</p>

  <p>"You said that the hatred-level Treacherous Beings only attack the living things that are sprinkled with the Ghost Powder. So, as long as we don't come into contact with it, we should be fine then, right?" Zheng asked after thinking about it for a while.</p>

  <p>Then, with an innocent smile on his face, Decker answered, "Hmm, no. You will still be in danger."</p>
