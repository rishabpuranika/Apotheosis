  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a headache coming on.</p>

  <p>He was not good at putting on airs and what was worse, he had let this little girl see through him.</p>

  <p>"This price isn't for you alone," Linn said. "In the past few years, I told anyone who asked about the price of this mud the same thing: that it was priced at five hundred divine might coins. But I feel that it is more appropriate to ask you for a thousand divine might coins. I know you know the value of this mud."</p>

  <p>Linn was speaking the truth. She knew this piece of mud was extraordinary, but what made it special, she didn't know. No one in the Six-Burden Divine City would be able to point it out.</p>

  <p>And now, Zheng came along, seeming to know everything about the mud.</p>

  <p>How could she let him go?</p>

  <p>Linn was right. Even if she charged Zheng a thousand divine might coins, he would probably have no choice but to accept it.</p>

  <p>He was clear about what was going on in his inner world. This thing would probably turn out to be extremely useful to him if it was able to evoke such a reaction from his inner world's consciousness. But the twist was: he did not know how it could benefit him.</p>

  <p>However, he was not willing to spend five hundred gold coins on the mud. He shook his head and said, "It's too expensive. I'm just a proving godly warrior. How could I have that much money?"</p>

  <p>Five hundred divine might coins! Even mid-rank True Gods couldn't take out that much money. Most proving godly warriors were extremely poor, and would have to work hard for a long time just to earn a divine might coin.</p>

  <p>Linn's eyes were full of regret. She had obviously thought of this. How could she even expect a proving godly warrior to take out so much money? But she knew that the proving godly warriors who dared enter the Money Alley more or less had some background. And she continued talking in order to probe the best price Zheng could offer.</p>

  <p>"Then how much can you offer?" Linn asked.</p>

  <p>"I only have thirty divine might coins," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Only thirty?" Linn stared at Zheng, the corners of her mouth lifting into a smile. "That's too less. I can't sell it at that price."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all I have," Zheng said regretfully and turned to leave.</p>

  <p>Linn's smile didn't slip as she watched Zheng leave. She was still counting to herself. One step, two steps, three steps… Ten steps, eleven steps…</p>

  <p>He was not far away when he suddenly turned around and walked back.</p>

  <p>He declared loudly, "I'll double it! Sixty divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>Linn shook her head.</p>

  <p>If the seniors of the Tie Clan were to see this scene, they would probably curse Linn for being stupid for not accepting it.</p>

  <p>They knew that they'd be happy to get ten divine might coins in exchange for the piece of mud, the use of which they had absolutely no idea about. And now when someone had offered sixty divine might coins for it, Linn had ended up refusing him!</p>

  <p>"Zheng, why must you buy this piece of mud?" Master Evil, asked, very confused.</p>

  <p>Although he was staying in Zheng's mind at the moment, he didn't know much about Zheng himself. Master Evil had always been confused about one thing. With Zheng's talent and cultivation foundation, it wasn't difficult for him to master a Godly Way. But why hadn't he condensed a Godly Tile yet?</p>

  <p>He wanted to enter Zheng's inner world to see if he could help, but Zheng had refused. He didn't allow Master Evil to pry.</p>

  <p>Master Evil knew that Zheng still didn't trust him. After all, he didn't have a deep friendship with Zheng. But what kind of secret did Zheng have that he was hiding it so deep?</p>

  <p>"One hundred and I'll take it," Zheng said, his eyes hardening as he clenched his teeth.</p>

  <p>Linn was tempted by this price. If she could really sell this piece of mud for over a hundred divine might coins, she would definitely be rewarded by the clan. She hesitated from within, but her expression didn't change.</p>

  <p>If Zheng still turned and left, she could still chase him and get him back.</p>

  <p>At this moment, two people rushed over. These were Linn's uncles and were both low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan was a small one. They would usually sell what they had gained through this shop. In fact, the Money Alley was a big market in the Six-Burden Divine City and the revenues of the shop that Linn managed could sustain the operation of the entire Tie Clan.</p>

  <p>"A hundred divine might coins? Sorry but it's still a no go. Uncle Alfred and Uncle John, why are you here?" Linn greeted her two uncles, her eyes still studying Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>"What is being sold for that price?" Alfred was surprised. He knew that the Tie Clan hadn't obtained any valuable treasures recently, which was why he was startled upon hearing the price.</p>

  <p>"The mud you dug up, Uncle Alfred," Linn said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"A hundred divine might coins, and you are not selling it?" His eyeballs nearly popped out of his eye sockets.</p>

  <p>John was also startled. He had seen that Zheng was only a proving godly warrior, which was why he hadn't paid much attention to him. But since Zheng was offering such a high price, he was now naturally beginning to see him in a new light. He examined Zheng carefully. And suddenly, his eyes gleamed as a thought seemed to occur to him.</p>

  <p>"Come and take this, friend. I was the one who dug this mud out back then. A hundred divine might coins, and that's a deal," Alfred said, hurriedly picking up the piece of mud.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to hand it over to Zheng, Linn said angrily, "Uncle Alfred!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, John reached out to stop Alfred and pulled him and Lynn aside. While he spoke to them, Linn and Alfred kept shooting occasional looks at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled wryly at this. He had already expected the man to recognize him.</p>

  <p>The story of Zheng in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant had already spread throughout the city.</p>

  <p>But Zheng hadn't revealed his name. Although the other True Gods of the Six-Burden Divine City knew about his story, not many people could recognize him.</p>

  <p>However, one of this girl's uncles seemed to have recognized him. As expected, when the little girl returned, she smiled and said to Zheng, "This item, five hundred divine might coins. Anything below this and we'll not sell it."</p>

  <p>Linn now knew that Zheng was the one who had defeated Eric with one strike in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant and won five thousand divine might coins from the Hulan Clan. So it was expected for her to take a firm stand! But still, Linn was a principled person. If she were not, she would be asking for a price of more than two thousand divine might coins; not just five hundred.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave the girl a deep, meaningful look. He knew that it was useless to say anything. If he had known this earlier, he would have been more decisive.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins that he had won from Eric hadn't been transferred into his space ring yet. Zheng shook his sword sheath and the divine might coins fell out one by one.</p>

  <p>Five hundred divine might coins was not a small transaction in the Money Alley. It immediately attracted the attention of the people on both sides of the street.</p>

  <p>When some of the True Gods saw that Zheng was merely a proving godly warrior and was still able to take out such a large sum of money, they were surprised. As more and more people gathered there to look, someone recognized Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Look, it's the kid that defeated Eric at the Brilliant Moon Restaurant?"</p>

  <p>"He won five thousand divine might coins with one move. He has made a huge fortune!"</p>

  <p>"This guy has such great luck!"</p>

  <p>"Luck? If you do not rely on your cultivation of a True God, can you defeat that young master from the Hulan Clan?"</p>

  <p>Amidst these discussions, Zheng took over the piece of mud from Linn.</p>

  <p>The moment he grabbed the mud, the consciousness from his inner world started to pour out like a hungry wolf setting eyes on a sheep. It could not wait any longer.</p>

  <p>"Really? So many divine might coins just to buy a piece of mud?"</p>

  <p>"The Tie Clan has placed that piece of trash there as a treasure for several years. That young girl from the Tie Clan knows how to do business, but this piece of mud has always been priced at five hundred!"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred divine might coins? I'll eat that piece of mud if it can be sold at that price!"</p>

  <p>"Too late. It had already been sold."</p>

  <p>Everyone was dumbfounded. They could not believe that someone would buy that item at such a preposterously high price. What was more, the one who had bought it was the kid who had just become famous by defeating Eric.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had counted the divine might coins and paid the bill, he stuffed the mud into his space ring and left, the crowd parting as he made his way out.</p>

  <p>He had been ripped off by the little girl, but Zheng still felt that it was worth it. He believed that this seemingly ordinary object contained quite a few secrets.</p>

  <p>Master Evil didn't ask anything along the way. He knew that if Zheng wasn't willing to tell him, it must be related to his secret. Master Evil also knew that he was relying on Zheng now, so he wouldn't ask about things he shouldn't know.</p>

  <p>Once he returned to his temporary residence in the Six-Burden Divine City, Zheng sat down with his legs crossed. He placed the piece of mud in front of him and carefully inspected it.</p>

  <p>His inner world's consciousness was now restless. Out of caution, Zheng would not casually place this item into his cinnabar field.</p>
