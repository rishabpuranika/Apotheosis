  <p>
</p>

  <p>This statue seemed to have been highly reinforced and as a result had become impregnable.</p>

  <p>Zheng also felt surprised upon discovering this about the effigy.</p>

  <p>Challenges in the blood-red castle might be a process of elimination, but the mysterious girl had helped him immediately strengthen the statue, making it utterly indestructible.</p>

  <p>Given the hardness of the statue, it would prove difficult even for Zheng to destroy it.</p>

  <p>This left Zheng feeling morose and bored.</p>

  <p>During this process of elimination, he seemed to have nothing to do.</p>

  <p>Wave after wave of beasts rushed into the blood-red castle like floodwaters, ready to overcome the warriors.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, there were a large number of Nether Pangolins, and now countless Wind Dragons had also turned to the attack.</p>

  <p>Zheng's statue stood like an impregnable boulder, in the middle of the castle hall, and the beasts dashed themselves to pieces on its unassailable surface.</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors, some were crushed by the vicious beasts or forced to run for their lives, and some could only try their best to hang on.</p>

  <p>In the end, even Karl could not hold out!</p>

  <p>After all, the vicious beasts became increasingly stronger. Although the sacred shield Karl had condensed was incomparably sturdy, it was also exhausting his will...</p>

  <p>Zheng sliced open the head of a Wind Dragon with a single slash, but his face was filled with boredom.</p>

  <p>The first target of these Wind Dragons was the statues, and they wouldn't even dodge Zheng's attack...</p>

  <p>Zheng would probably even be able to pass the first round of the competition easily without even striking a blowing. He'd already resigned himself to becoming merely an onlooker.</p>

  <p>"This is unnecessary." Zheng curled his lips down as a disappointed look appeared on his face. Although he knew that the mysterious girl had intended to help him with her kindness, it had also made him lose any chance of challenging these beasts.</p>

  <p>Lowering his head to look at his space ring, he stretched out his hand and gently pressed down, making a selection. Accompanied by a flash of light, the Teleportation Token appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng's statue was extremely hard, he could pass the first round of the elimination match without even taking any action.</p>

  <p>With a flash of light, Zheng was teleported into the strange space.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the main cities marked in this space had almost completely disappeared, leaving only the three main red cities in the center. These were the three blood-red castles.</p>

  <p>Without much consideration, Zheng randomly chose one of the main cities and sank down to it.</p>

  <p>Right now, the three blood-red castles were undergoing massive attacks from various beasts, and the warriors were constantly being eliminated as they were trampled, disemboweled, and ravaged by the savage beasts.</p>

  <p>Of the 2, 500 warriors, more than 1, 000 of them were kicked out of this place and eliminated the moment that their statues were destroyed by the vicious beasts.</p>

  <p>Although they were unwilling to leave, this was the rule of the Illusion Battlefield and they had to be eliminated if they couldn't withstand the beast attacks.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a burst of white light, Zheng appeared near the top of the hall of the blood-red castle and heavily crashed down in a shower of dust and debris.</p>

  <p>When the warriors, who were all engaged with fighting the vicious beasts, saw him, they were startled.</p>

  <p>What had just happened?</p>

  <p>Why was there another guy entering the challenge, at this time?</p>

  <p>In the hall of this blood-red castle, seven flying swords of different colors floated protectively around Margaret.</p>

  <p>These seven flying swords were legacy treasures of the Apeiron Tower.</p>

  <p>To achieve a victory in the world of chaos, Elder Apeiron had handed these weapons over to Margaret, and she had also let her take them into the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret had never used these swords before...</p>

  <p>But in order to protect her statue, Margaret had summoned these seven flying swords without hesitation. She would use their might to defend her statue at all costs.</p>

  <p>The seven flying swords flew back and forth between her and the statue.</p>

  <p>They formed seven colorful lines that protected Margaret's statue very well. Even so, there were still some cracks showing on the statue.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Nathan, who was beside Margaret, seemed to deal with the ravenous beasts with both skill and ease.</p>

  <p>Nathan had acquired nearly three hundred million Illusion Points in the Illusion Battlefield already! Now, he had used those Illusion Points to strengthen his statue, which could naturally become much stronger than any ordinary warrior's. Moreover, Nathan's strength was extraordinary; hence, he performed well in this round of competition.</p>

  <p>Of course, no matter how skillful he was, he couldn't hold a candle to Zheng. Having felt bored, Zheng had left his statue in another blood-red castle, and he had run over here, where he was watching the show like an idler.</p>

  <p>"Young lady, you haven't told me your name yet!" Nathan said indifferently from beside Margaret. Although there was a lingering trace of a cold and gloomy aura from him, his pleasant voice and his handsome appearance quickly set people at ease.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Margaret said coldly. The seven flying swords spun even faster as they dispatched more of the fearsome beasts.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, she had chopped more than ten Wind Dragons into pieces.</p>

  <p>These Wind Dragons, which were the Law Creatures that were born in the fiercest winds, weren't very strong. However, before they died and disappeared, they would turn into countless wind blades that instantly pierced through everything. If the warriors weren't careful enough, their statues would be damaged by those wind blades. So the warriors had to be extremely cautious while they were dealing with the Wind Dragons.</p>

  <p>These creatures would claim a savage revenge once they were killed.</p>

  <p>Margaret did not care whether she was eliminated. After all, her master did not require her to be ranked first...</p>

  <p>However, as she was very likely to encounter Zheng here, how could she give up so easily?</p>

  <p>Nathan, who stayed beside Margaret, talked to her all the time, thoroughly annoying her a lot.</p>

  <p>"If you tell me your name, I can protect you and ensure that you won't be eliminated," Nathan offered with a huge grin. As he gently clapped his hands, waves of invisible force rushed towards the Law Creatures.</p>

  <p>All the Wind Dragons within 100 feet seemed to suddenly have their throats grabbed by an invisible hand, and they were lifted into the air, where they struggled unceasingly...</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched out his hand and squeezed tightly!</p>

  <p>The hundreds of Wind Dragons, caught in his grasp, were broken into two by him!</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Several hundred Wind Dragons were instantly killed and immediately transformed into a storm of sharp wind blades, shooting towards Margaret and Nathan.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan still seemed unperturbed. With a light wave of his hand, all of the wind blades, which shot over, automatically dissipated, turning into the gentle breezes...</p>

  <p>"So strong." Seeing this, Margaret's eyes narrowed slightly in admiration.</p>

  <p>She was no longer what she used to be, as her six years of cultivation in the Apeiron Tower had given her a whole new understanding of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Nathan's move was truly spectacular. He had actually managed to instantly dissolve the wind blades!</p>

  <p>However, after Nathan had so swiftly killed those Wind Dragons, a large number of the creatures stormed over, rushing towards Margaret...</p>

  <p>At this moment, Nathan did not make any moves to kill them. His figure was like the wind as he dodged, allowing the Wind Dragons to attack Margaret.</p>

  <p>Margaret lightly bit her dark, red lips as the seven flying swords worked in an even closer collusion to handle those Wind Dragons...</p>

  <p>In truth, with her strength, dealing with the Wind Dragon wasn't difficult at all. But when she had strengthened the statue, she had wasted a large amount of Illusion Points and didn't enhance the statue's defensive power. Hence, not enough was done to make it strong enough.</p>

  <p>Thus her statue could not resist the wind blades at all. With just a slight misjudgment, her statue would be damaged with a deep cut on it!</p>

  <p>Although her sword array was powerful enough to fight against any enemy, it would still be slightly difficult to block these attacking wind blades.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a wind blade pierced through a gap in her sword array. A part of the wind blade was not blocked by her and instantly struck her statue.</p>

  <p>It cut her statue apart!</p>

  <p>Noting this scene, Margaret got upset, and her eyes gleamed with a hint of helplessness.</p>

  <p>Nathan still wore a slight smile on his face as he indifferently looked at Margaret. With his great reputation, he was admired by most women, and even many men, who strove to be like Nathan.</p>

  <p>As long as Nathan wanted to be with a woman, many talented and charming women were lining up to accompany him.</p>

  <p>As a Godly Genius, he was the main character of this era. Who could oppose him?</p>

  <p>However, Margaret had been the first woman that he was interested in.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that she would be so cold to him...</p>

  <p>Being a haughty and confident warrior, Nathan truly believed that there was nothing that he could not accomplish.</p>

  <p>"Young lady... It would be a pity if you are eliminated like that, after struggling so hard to reach this point..."</p>

  <p>However, Margaret continued to ignore him. She could only sneer coldly at him and continue resisting the attacks from the Wind Dragons.</p>

  <p>Not far away, another group of Wind Dragons began their assault run towards her.</p>

  <p>With a twist of her long, thin eyebrows, she summoned the seven swords. Then they all realigned into a new spiral sword array, while Margaret dashed forward!</p>

  <p>At the same time, she took up her statue, held it tightly against her body and began to retreat!</p>

  <p>However, just as she started to back away, she saw several more wind blades catapulting towards her from the other side.</p>

  <p>The Wind Dragons had long ago spread across the entire castle's hall.</p>

  <p>Once a Wind Dragon was killed, it would release the storm of wind blades. Everyone in this hall was in danger, because the wind blades could appear at any time, and they killed indiscriminately.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had already suffered this awful fate and died because of this.</p>

  <p id="top_10">As she kept on retreating, Margaret suddenly felt shocked as she noticed something. Her seven flying swords had already formed their protective barrier between her and the Wind Dragons, but they seemed to not be capable of stopping the wind blades!</p>

  <p>Noticing her impending doom, Margaret bit her lips, and her eyes contained both a resentful and disappointed look.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. I almost met Zheng. But now it seems as if it was all just a fruitless effort!"</p>

  <p>If her statue was damaged, she would be eliminated. The realization of her dream to see Zheng again would then be delayed!</p>

  <p>However, right at this crucial moment, a figure lazily drifted over.</p>
