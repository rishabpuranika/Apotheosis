<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4020 The Black Head </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Campbell's body had been stretched out, so it took some time for him to recover and turn back to his human shape.</p>

  <p>After he could move properly, he headed back for the door, but as he did, his expression darkened.</p>

  <p>The exit had been blasted into pieces; the entire passageway had been destroyed!</p>

  <p>"Is this some kind of trap set up a long time ago?" Campbell asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Only the Four Spirits Sect, or to be exact, only some members of the Human Spirit Sect knew about the secret passage to the main world.</p>

  <p>Someone had blatantly destroyed the secret passage. The traitor must be someone from the Four Spirits Sect, or to be exact, the Human Spirit Sect...</p>

  <p>This proved Luo Zheng right.</p>

  <p>"This place is so close to the Abstruse Energy World. Can you leave by going up?" Luo Zheng asked Campbell as he pointed at the sky.</p>

  <p>Looking up, he felt the Abstruse Energy World was so close, as though it was within his reach.</p>

  <p>Campbell glared at Luo Zheng. "Don't be stupid. Take that path if you want to court death."</p>

  <p>The force field that lingered above the Jade Pure Realm had actually been set up by Campbell and his companions, so he knew the risks.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then I'm afraid you have no choice but to pass through the road controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization," Luo Zheng said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know that," Campbell snapped impatiently.</p>

  <p>The path they were supposed to take, the one that had been destroyed, was actually a secret shortcut. The usual bridge between the chaos and the Abstruse Energy World was the road controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"But the Element Spirit Civilization won't let you pass," Luo Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization? Are they powerful?" Campbell asked.</p>

  <p>At the mention of any of the creatures in the chaos, Campbell's expression would change a little, from scornful to condescending.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the creatures in the chaos were, Campbell usually didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was an exception. After all, Luo Zheng had been to the Eternal Divine Courtyard and passed the test of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"It's the strongest civilization on the Other Shore. They were the first civilization after the chaos was created," Luo Zheng explained patiently. "There's no way we can defeat them in this condition, and they won't let you pass."</p>

  <p>"I can't defeat them?" Campbell asked, eyebrow raised dubiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Campbell hesitantly. "I'm not sure. Well, you have killed Les before you woke up..."</p>

  <p>"Is Les a member of the Element Spirit Civilization?"</p>

  <p>Even after awakening, Campbell still retained his memories from when he was still asleep. Naturally, he remembered how he had killed Les.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Campbell, Les was indeed powerful, but he still triumphed over him easily when he shrank him into oblivion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is said that he is one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization."</p>

  <p>Campbell smiled slightly. "Then they're not worth taking seriously, either."</p>

  <p>Although his real body had already perished, his body as a Treacherous Being was a great weapon. Naturally, he was confident he could defeat anyone from the Element Spirit Civilization. After all, he did kill one of their leaders.</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard maniacal laughter burst out from somewhere on the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>It was as if countless people were laughing crazily. Then, they sensed a terrible aura in the air.</p>

  <p>Someone was speaking Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Campbell's expression darkened. It seemed he could understand the voice.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, help me decipher the Sanskrit words!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cried as he transmitted the laughter to his inner world.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to translate the noise. "Not worth taking seriously... As a mere world builder who wasn't even accepted by the Ten Directions House, how dare you speak recklessly now? Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>From the bottom of the Pure Sky Platform, the huge black head suddenly reared its unsettling face, eyes and mouth wide open. That was where the waves of laughter were coming from!</p>

  <p>As it laughed, it slowly moved along the bottom of the Pure Sky Platform until it reached the edge of the platform.</p>

  <p>It was a black head that was ten thousand feet tall. It had no body, but instead there were many oval spheres under it. Luo Zheng recognized these spheres; they were the large-headed monsters that they had encountered before.</p>

  <p>Whenever the large-headed monsters were killed by Campbell, they would disappear and revive in another place. This was the case with all the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng never expected that the place where these monsters were revived was right underneath the Pure Sky Platform!</p>

  <p>These monsters all huddled under the massive black head like grapes on a vine, rendering the black head even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Ying and the others saw the huge creature, their faces turned pale.</p>

  <p>"The resentment-level... It's the resentment-level Treacherous Being!" the leader of the black-robed men cried.</p>

  <p>Although the Treacherous Beings were divided into three levels, with the hatred level being the strongest, no one had ever actually seen a hatred-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Thus, the resentment-level Treacherous Being was already regarded as the most formidable one.</p>

  <p>Even the three Eternal Realm Hunters bore serious expressions. Judging from the aura released by the black head, all the trouble they had experienced before amounted to nothing compared to this moment.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Campbell asked, raising his head.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being must have been formed by the creature of the main world after it died.</p>

  <p>The more powerful the creature was, the more formidable its Treacherous Being would be.</p>

  <p>The creature, which formed the resentment-level Treacherous Being, must've been extremely powerful when it was alive.</p>

  <p>The black head howled in laughter. "You don't need to know who I am," it said in Sanskrit. "You just need to know that you should've stayed on the Whining Road!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The black head's eyes began to flicker with red light which shot out after accumulating to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>"Run!" Luo Zheng cried.</p>

  <p>When the crowd saw two rays of red light shooting towards them, they all dodged to the side.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they were able to dodge in time. The red light swept over and past them.</p>

  <p>Campbell, too, was able to jump out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>Only one man in the black robe was a split-second too slow. Before he could even scream, the red light flashed through him.</p>

  <p>At first, he stood perfectly still.</p>

  <p>Then, the man in the black robe collapsed into a pile of black soot.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at the scene in horror. How could they not be seized with fear, knowing that one touch of the llight would burn them to dust?</p>

  <p>Having dodged the red light, Campbell stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>The armor, which had been scattered on the ground, dashed straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the spear pulsated with energy.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>In less than three seconds, the armor had been completely attached onto Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!" Campbell ordered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gripped the spear tightly and nodded. Raising his hand, he jabbed the spear towards the monster in the distance.</p>

  <p>A silver light shot out from the tip of the spear. The black head had no form of defenses whatsoever, so the Light of Annihilation pierced through it cleanly.</p>

  <p>However, once the silver light faded, there was but a small hole on the black head. Compared to its overall size, the piercing was but a mosquito bite.</p>

  <p>However, the Light of Annihilation on the spear in Luo Zheng's hand had completely dimmed.</p>

  <p></p>
