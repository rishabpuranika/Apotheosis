<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2160 Special Way To Eat (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Everyone in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant had their eyes fixed on Zheng as they made all sorts of guesses about his identity. A bizarre range of speculations rose through the chatter of the customers.</p>

  <p>Eric stood formidably alone in the center of the patio. His eyes were still focused on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Eric had appeared in a high-profile manner to show his might. The earlier encounter with the burly man was to exhibit his great strength and prowess.</p>

  <p>The examination of the Heavenly Han House was difficult. The process not only involved strength but many other things as well. There were many variables, and it didn't necessarily mean that one could pass just because one was strong. As such, many warriors failed to be part of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Eric originally thought that after he intimidated those martial artists, everyone would be afraid of him during the examination. As such, they wouldn't dare to act rashly against him.</p>

  <p>However, just after he won the match, everyone suddenly shifted their focus to the delicacies of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. Eric couldn't believe how easily his prestige was stolen.</p>

  <p>As he felt depressed, Eric pointed at Zheng and shouted, "Hey! You!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was still captivated about the aftertaste of the pill. Suddenly, he saw Eric point at him and shout loudly. Due to the interruption of his mood, Zheng frowned and said with an annoyed tone, "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"How about I challenge you?" The corner of Eric's mouth curled up as he issued a challenge. He then continued, "If you won, these would be all yours!" As he spoke, Eric's stare pointed at the divine might coins in front of his feet.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes followed Eric's gaze. A cold smile came across Zheng's face as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? You don't dare? Are you a coward?" Eric felt unhappy and continued to provoke Zheng. If Zheng didn't agree to the challenge, then he really would have no way to deal with him. Even if he was a member of the Hulan Clan, he couldn't act rashly in the Six-Burden Divine City. It was forbidden to attack anyone outside of a duel.</p>

  <p>If Eric were to break that rule, the punishment of the Thousand Commandments Slate was very serious.</p>

  <p>Zheng replied, "It's not that I don't dare, it's that those are not enough. You need much more than that to challenge me."</p>

  <p>"You mean that these divine might coins are not enough? Ha-ha, what a useless excuse!" Eric's eyes lit up. Money didn't seem to be a problem for him.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded without a word. A mysterious aura still surrounded him as others silently watched the two warriors exchange words.</p>

  <p>However, with a wave of Eric's hand, another bunch of divine might coins fell from his hands. Heavy and blunt sounds echoed as two to three hundred divine might coins hit the ground.</p>

  <p>"Amazing! The Hulan Clan is really rich! Eric is just a mere proving godly warrior, but he takes along so many divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>"This world is just too unfair. Many True Gods have worked hard for so many divine eras, yet they still can't earn that much money..."</p>

  <p>"I think that fellow is probably just making an excuse. No matter how many more divine might coins Eric throws at him, he won't dare to accept the challenge. Maybe he's just afraid but can't admit that he's terrified of Eric."</p>

  <p>In everyone's eyes, Zheng was totally no match for Eric. With his display of power before, Eric's brutality was deeply engraved to their minds.</p>

  <p>They thought that Zheng just did not want to lose face. He only said that the money Eric had given him was not enough so that he wouldn't need to accept that he was weaker than Eric.</p>

  <p>However, Eric had thrown out more divine might coins again. The number of divine might coins in the patio was already about six or seven hundred. The bystanders continued to ogle at the absurd amount of money on the ground.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze once again gathered on Zheng as they waited for his reaction.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng still shook his head, "Not enough."</p>

  <p>Eric didn't seem angry at all. He slapped his waist, and a spark of golden light flashed. A gold bracelet appeared in his hand. As he continuously shook the gold bracelet, divine might coins flew out from it. The people around them could not believe their eyes.</p>

  <p>Another 300 divine might coins fell to the patio.</p>

  <p>In a short while, the number of divine might coins in the patio reached a thousand.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze was once again fixed on the divine might coins. Such treasures were only to be looked at by them.</p>

  <p>1000 divine might coins...</p>

  <p>Many of the proving godly warriors were dumbfounded. Their hearts raced with the intense situation in front of them.</p>

  <p>Most likely, most mid-rank True Gods only had that much money. To be able to throw away such a huge sum, Eric was envied by the warriors around him.</p>

  <p>Some of the elite members of the powerful clans also wanted to give it a try. They were quite confident of their battle prowess and such a huge amount of money would be useful to them. However, Eric wanted to challenge Zheng, not them.</p>

  <p>"Still not enough," Zheng continued to shake his head as he poured himself a cup of wine. A callous look was on his face as he rejected the offer once more.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Eric was finally a bit annoyed. Zheng had already rejected him several times. He glared at Zheng and asked coldly, "Just how much is enough."</p>

  <p>As he heard Eric's angry tone, Zheng finally smiled. That was what he had hoped to hear.</p>

  <p>He knew that not only were there matches in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, there was also gambling. It was a good way for him to earn some money.</p>

  <p>However, he also knew that he only had one chance. Once he won, most likely no idiot would be so stupid as to give him the divine might coins for free again.</p>

  <p>As he saw an opportunity to earn as many divine might coins as he could, Zheng meticulously incited Eric's attention.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng didn't want to challenge Eric. He indeed felt that the number of divine might coins was not enough. Two hundred was not enough. Even the one thousand divine might coins were still not enough.</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted an opportunity to get as much as he needed.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that the fellow from the Hulan Clan would be so impetuous. As such, the opportunity to earn a huge sum appeared in front of Zheng rather quickly.</p>

  <p>"This much," Zheng held out five fingers and said calmly. An arrogant smile came across his face.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand divine might coins?" Eric asked as he frowned.</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's mouth curled up slightly, "That's right!"</p>

  <p>"Five thousand..."</p>

  <p>"That fellow is really arrogant! That's way too much!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he purposely said a big number. He is making it difficult for Eric. I'm afraid that guy doesn't really want to accept the challenge. What a coward!"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, he might have underestimated the Hulan Clan's wealth.</p>

  <p>5000 divine might coins is indeed a huge amount of money, but for the Hulan Clan, it's not a big problem."</p>

  <p>As expected, Eric was deep in thought for a moment. After a few seconds, he looked at Zheng and smiled coldly. Then with a prideful tone, he said, "Five thousand it is!"</p>

  <p>With that, Eric raised his head and shouted towards the fourth floor,</p>

  <p>"Uncle Lambert!"</p>
