<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan had always exuded confidence.</p>

  <p>Such was his faith in himself.</p>

  <p>There was no cultivation methods or martial skills that were too difficult for him to grasp.</p>

  <p>There was no opponent that he failed to defeat.</p>

  <p>There were no hardships that he could not overcome.</p>

  <p>No one from his generation could compete with him because he was the strongest of them all!</p>

  <p>Nobody possessed his level of talent. He had become a Godly Genius at such a young age, and only a handful of people could take him on.</p>

  <p>Nobody else had a nobler background than him. His clan was the greatest clan in the entire universe!</p>

  <p>It was impossible for anyone to get to him as he was the best of the rest.</p>

  <p>He had inferred that even though Zheng's sword skill was powerful, he could only use it twice or thrice at most. So he would still lose to Shania in the end.</p>

  <p>However, the development that followed exceeded Nathan's imagination.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng launched his first strike, he had no intention of slowing down or stopping.</p>

  <p>His attacks were getting faster and more intense.</p>

  <p>Each strike contained an incomparably sharp sword intent.</p>

  <p>His sword intent was so powerful that it felt like it could pierce through the heaven and earth as it charged towards Shania.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>He sent out dozens of slashes back to back.</p>

  <p>"This guy...! He is a real monster!" Nathan commented as he stared at Luo Zheng with mixed feelings. He was a little confused.</p>

  <p>'But he didn't consume any life vitality jade to replenish his life vitality.</p>

  <p>How strange!</p>

  <p>Does he have a great treasure that can store large amounts of life vitality?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Such treasures were extremely rare in the universe. For example, the Vitality Storing Vessel, which ranked 120th on the Universe Spirit Tablet, could store a large amount of vitality between heaven and earth and double the amount of life vitality used by a warrior during a fight.</p>

  <p>But even if Zheng's life vitality was doubled, it still wouldn't be enough to launch so many consecutive attacks.</p>

  <p>Nathan just could not figure it out.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one who was flummoxed.</p>

  <p>All the warriors who had witnessed this fight were just as puzzled as him.</p>

  <p>A single slash by Zheng's sword would consume a huge amount of life vitality, let alone dozens of it.</p>

  <p>Most people had the same question in their minds: where did Zheng's life vitality come from?</p>

  <p>Shania was thinking the same thing as Nathan. She had suppressed Luo Zheng ruthlessly at the beginning of the fight so that he was forced to launch his strongest counterattack.</p>

  <p>She believed that if she could survive this wave of attacks, she would drain him and then her time to defeat him would come.</p>

  <p>But things didn't go as expected by her.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike swooshed crazily towards her. There seemed to be no end in sight, as he kept sending wave after wave of attacks her way.</p>

  <p>What was more, every new slash of his sword was stronger than the last one.</p>

  <p>The most troublesome thing was that since Shania and Luo Zheng were both standing on the line of the Life-or-Death Space, she couldn't dodge to either side. She could only keep retreating backwards.</p>

  <p>Obviously, it was doubly difficult for her to dodge Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike while moving in a straight line.</p>

  <p>Now she had no choice but to stop using the Circle of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>This skill had already lost its effect on Luo Zheng. Maintaining it would backfire, and restrict her own movements.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A ray of sword light flashed past her snow-white thigh and hit the board, leaving a small crack on it. Although the crack seemed small, it had actually penetrated right through the board.</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>At the same time, a stream of blood gushed from her leg. Drops of blood dripped down her snow-white thigh, which looked extremely scary.</p>

  <p>Normally, she could heal this small injury by herself in an instant.</p>

  <p>But now, she couldn't even spare a micro-second. Before the previous sword radiance disappeared, Zheng's fresh attacks arrived, ceaselessly and mercilessly.</p>

  <p>"Heart Eating Insect!" Shania yelled as she continued retreating backwards.</p>

  <p>She extended her arms and countless Heart Eating Insects swiftly materialized around her.</p>

  <p>The Heart Eating Insects gathered and formed a giant arrow as they charged towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These insects couldn't be trifled with. A few ace talents had learned this the hard way earlier.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng did not dare to drop his guard before them.</p>

  <p>He empowered the sword blade with a layer of sword intent and then stabbed the sword rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Heart Eating Insects were not afraid of fire or water. They couldn't be killed using ordinary methods.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword intensified to a great extent with the sword intent. The tip of the sword jabbed the Heart Eating Insect accurately.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>With a sharp explosion, the insects' formation broke into fragments.</p>

  <p>"It worked!" he exclaimed with surprise.</p>

  <p>Originally, he had been wary of these insects because of the sheer number of them as well as their unstoppable power.</p>

  <p>Now that he realized that he could easily destroy them, he calmed down.</p>

  <p>He waved his wrist slightly, and the tip of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword quickly swept across the air.</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>The Heart Eating Insects exploded one by one in front of his sword like tiny bubbles.</p>

  <p>But many more insects followed behind. This time when they got close enough, Luo Zheng employed the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>Although the Heart Eating Insects were tiny in size, they still caused vibrations when they flew in the air.</p>

  <p>The Heart Eating Insects stopped at a distance of three inches from him and struggled to approach any closer.</p>

  <p>Although the Eight Smoky Melodies was indeed a powerful skill, it could be beaten by Shania and any other Godly Genius without difficulty. But currently it was the best way to keep the Heart Eating Insects away from him.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the two cultivation methods practiced by Luo Zheng happened to be very effective against Shania's theurgy.</p>

  <p>Shania kept dodging his assault with growing indignation. Suddenly, she waved her hand, and a wooden staff appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>It was thin at the end, while its top resembled a bird's nest. It was adorned with green leaves, and one could sense a strong life energy within it.</p>

  <p>It was a treasure exclusive to the Queen of Life of the Demon Night race— the Staff of Life, which ranked thirty-second in all of the supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>"Taste my wrath, you brat!" she spat.</p>

  <p>She was absolutely furious about being forced to use this treasure by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had expected to defeat him quite easily, but found herself in an awkward predicament.</p>

  <p>Her helplessness finally forced her to use the Staff of Life.</p>

  <p>The moment Shania raised the Staff of Life in her hand, her face glowed with extraordinary grace.</p>

  <p>It was as if, in that moment, she had turned into another Ying.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Streams of green life energy emanated from within the Staff of Life.</p>

  <p>The power vibrated violently in the air and separated into numerous specks, which slowly formed shapes on the board. Eventually, they turned into beasts of all shapes and sizes.</p>

  <p>The roars of these beasts reverberated across the arena.</p>

  <p>They were all twelfth-grade beasts, which were equivalent to Spirit Supreme Realm human warriors.</p>

  <p>The Squall Mastiffs.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Vultures.</p>

  <p>The Fiend Horses...</p>

  <p>As these vicious beasts materialized one by one, they all charged at Luo Zheng wanting to pounce on him.</p>

  <p>But how could they withstand Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike? Even the Sunflower Turtle with its toughest defense couldn't survive a single slash of the sword.</p>

  <p>But Shania was not using these beasts to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She only needed them to delay Luo Zheng for a while and prevent him from chasing after her while she worked on something else.</p>

  <p>She placed the Staff of Life horizontally in front of her and locked her gaze on him as she began to prepare for her strongest attack.</p>
