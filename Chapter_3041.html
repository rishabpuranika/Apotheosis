  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Who will die first?"</p>

  <p>Jagger's eyes widened as he heard Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Jagger was shrouded in fear.</p>

  <p>Ever since he emerged from the Sword Wall, he had never taken anyone seriously.</p>

  <p>Jagger was able to cross the eighth line in the Sea of Truth. As a reward, the Oneness Sky Palace had rewarded him with a lot of soul pills.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, it would not be long before he could reach the Other Shore! Knowing that he had enough soul pills to last the journey, he surely had a very promising future ahead of him.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, he had never expected that death would get so close to him.</p>

  <p>"No! You can't kill me!"</p>

  <p>Jagger kicked in the air and growled hysterically. At that point, he was losing hope for he was on the brink of giving up from escaping.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing this scene, the other disciples' expressions changed greatly as they had never expected how things turned out.</p>

  <p>"Stop it, you brat!"</p>

  <p>"If you choose to kill Jagger right here and right now, you will surely die a miserable death!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you! You bastard!"</p>

  <p>Hearing these words did not affect Zheng's decision. Instead, his sword remained pointed at Jagger.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an old man clad in a white robe appeared above the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>This man turned out to be a master at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Everyone who heard his roar felt dizzy, and even Zheng's mind was slightly affected by it.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was not enough for Zheng to change his mind as he swung his sword at Jagger without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The people who saw this were greatly astonished. Zheng's sword produced a dazzling light that enveloped Jagger, making him vanish into thin air.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all eyes were on Zheng for he blatantly killed Jagger in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>Carlisle was in disbelief at what he saw. His lips twitched in fear as he could not believe that his brother was shamelessly killed right in front of him.</p>

  <p>The white-robed disciples' faces darkened after witnessing such a gruesome scene. Never had they expected that Zheng would be so bold as to kill Jagger in front of many disciples!</p>

  <p>"Zheng made a very serious mistake!" Beldene scowled.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other disciples from the Sword Light Palace all looked at each other in dismay. As for Elgin, he commended, "Hum...Well done, Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Furious, the old man in a white robe quickly descended from the Sword Wall and pointed his finger at Zheng. "How dare you! How dare you murder a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace beneath the Sword Wall! You made a serious offense, you bold brat! How audacious of you to court death!"</p>

  <p>The other disciples in white robes walked up to the man to show their respect to him due to his high status.</p>

  <p>Carlisle followed suit as he flew over to him. With a mournful look on his face, he gritted his teeth and said, "Sir, I beg you. Uphold justice for my elder brother Jagger!"</p>

  <p>The others present in the scene were shocked for it was such a rare moment to see an Other Shore Realm master to show up.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had killed Jagger, death seemed to follow him until the end.</p>

  <p>Zheng floated in the air and looked straight into the eyes of the old man in a white robe. Nonchalantly, Zheng spoke, "Sir, I believe that you are wrong. I was not the one courting death! It was Jagger!"</p>

  <p>"You must be joking! Jagger had crossed the Sword Wall and could be regarded as a member of the Oneness Sky Palace. In fact, he had been tasked in guarding the Sword Wall to maintain order and rules," a disciple shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng's eyes quickly turned sharp and cold. After breathing in, he started to retort, "To maintain order and rules, you say? Are you sure about that? While we were waiting, Jagger's younger brother came to us to look for trouble. After I taught him a lesson, Jagger wanted to kill me under the excuse of maintaining rules. What a clever way to take order and rules as an excuse to kill me! He attempted to kill me to cover up his own favoritism. Did you expect me to do nothing and be killed? And since he wanted to kill me, he should also be prepared to be killed! Jagger was definitely weaker than me and I defeated him. Isn't it obvious? He courted his own death!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods present heard all of Zheng's words and started to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>After all, they witnessed everything. They could not deny that Jagger had challenged Zheng, which eventually led to courting his own death.</p>

  <p>"What an articulate brat you are!" The old man sneered. "However, you are not a member of the Oneness Sky Palace. There is a glaring gap between you and Jagger regarding the status. The status is everything, you see, and so is power. Anyone who dares to kill our disciples will be courting death!</p>

  <p>You! You deserve nothing but death!"</p>

  <p>Apparently, this old man shared Jagger's last name and was from the same clan. Surely, he would not let go of Zheng so easily.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the old man in white robe stretched out his hand, revealing a long sword. Numerous pink flowers started to blossom around his sword as he prepared an attack.</p>

  <p>"How could you be so unreasonable!"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned scornfully.</p>

  <p>With the recent turn of events, Zheng had only proved his speculation to be true.</p>

  <p>In large clans of the divine land, there were quite several rules which restricted combat among their disciples.</p>

  <p>Unless there was a life-and-death war between two great clans, the disciples rarely lost their lives in combat.</p>

  <p>The most intensely competitive places were the forbidden lands and the Arena of Legends. However, people didn't die in the Arena of Legends. As for in the forbidden lands, one of their main tasks was to fight against monsters.</p>

  <p>The divine land was dominated by the human race, which meant that the warriors there didn't have much sense of crisis.</p>

  <p>However, the Source World was totally different. Since the human race didn't play a dominant role, they had to fight against countless races and demons. As they wanted to become stronger and conquer the other races, their internal competition had also become more fierce!</p>

  <p>Zheng had vaguely noticed this phenomenon in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that it was way more serious in the Oneness Sky Palace!</p>

  <p>Seeing that the old man in white was about to launch a fatal attack against him, Zheng immediately retreated and placed his fingers on the space ring.</p>

  <p>Whilst this was happening, he started to gather the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent in his body.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had used up the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent after he employed the Imperial Sword Seal. After several days of recovering, it was now ready to be used again.</p>

  <p>If the old man really wanted to kill him, then he wouldn't have any other choice but to use his trump card!</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng had another life insurance? Winchell. Only he would be able to save Evaristus, so he thought that Winchell wouldn't just stand by to see him get killed.</p>

  <p>This was another reason why Zheng was so brazen to kill Jagger without worrying about the consequence.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the old man activated the power of the pink flowers, a mild aura diffused from his sword.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this mild aura was some sort of spell used to bewitch the people.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was quick to sense the killing intent concealed within the mild aura. As soon as he felt the killing intent, he instantly realized that the man was powerful and that he would not be able to resist his attacks.</p>

  <p>"The Soaring Snake Sword... If I use it now, then it will cause me endless troubles. But there's no other choice for me now!"</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had made up his mind and was about to unsheathe the Soaring Snake Sword, the air suddenly became chilly.</p>

  <p>This gentle breeze, however, refreshed everyone as soon as it came in close contact with their faces.</p>

  <p>As soon as the stupefied crowd felt the sudden chill on their faces, they immediately regained their consciousness, clearing their minds.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an indifferent voice echoed through the air, "You can't kill him, Galen."</p>

  <p>Upon the arrival of this voice, a young man in a blue robe appeared, looking aloof.</p>

  <p>"How dare you stop me? Jagger did not die for nothing!" Galen, the old man, retorted stubbornly.</p>

  <p>The long sword in his hand continued to charge towards Zheng, emitting a wisp of pink breeze that swept towards him.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Galen ignored his words, the young man's face contorted in anger. All of a sudden, he moved his body, and his once gentle aura turned into an aura of violence. He dashed towards the old man and did not hesitate to throw a heavy punch at him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The impact was so intense that Galen was sent flying towards a mountain wall.</p>

  <p>With his fist still clenched, the young man's fury gradually returned to normal. With a little bit of anger remaining, he spoke, "How dare you turn a deaf ear to my words? This is your fault! You shouldn't have forced me to attack you!"</p>
