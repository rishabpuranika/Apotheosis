  <p>
</p>

  <p>Several bright, silver lights shot up to the sky after Turner called a meeting. Only half of the Soul Sea Realm masters stayed and rushed towards the imperial palace, choosing to obey his command instead.</p>

  <p>Those that obeyed were mostly people who had a good relationship with Turner, with some coming from the Zhou family. dozens of bright lights scattered all throughout the sky with the Soul Sea Realm warriors' ascension. It was a wondrous sight that left all citizens of the four divine kingdoms in awe.</p>

  <p>Titles had been handed over, management of family affairs had been imparted and instructions to disciples had already been given. The Soul Sea Realm masters could ascend peacefully to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Turner, War King Wind, Scott, and War Emperor York watched solemnly as they watched their subordinates ascend to the Upper World before them. Though happy for this opportunity, their hearts were a bit heavy at the thought of falling behind because of their responsibilities. They did not enjoy the same level of freedom as these warriors. They were emperors who needed to do more than just give a list of instructions to their descendants in order to ensure proper management of kingdom affairs.</p>

  <p>It would be quite a while before they could ascend with no worries.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was especially infuriated. Almost all of York Divine Kingdom's Soul Sea Realm masters had chosen to ascend with only one opting to remain - his younger brother.</p>

  <p>It didn't help that they all readily chose to go their way the instant the passageway was repaired, completely ignoring War Emperor York's summons. He had wanted to threaten them, to tell them that he would wipe out their clans if they ascended without his permission. However, he held himself back. He was also bound to ascend at some point. What if the enemies he made now came back and sought revenge on his clan once he left? It wasn't practical to lose his clan over a momentary feeling of rage.</p>

  <p>Still, he couldn't help but grit his teeth at the sight of the illuminated sky.</p>

  <p>He had never been a magnanimous ruler and had treated his kingdom's Soul Sea Realm warriors harshly. Now that they had been presented with a way out of his bondage, it was no surprise that none of them were willing to obey him and they chose to escape from his clutches instead.</p>

  <p>There were considerably more Soul Sea Realm warriors that chose to stay from the other three divine kingdoms. However, the number was still terribly low and the Divine Kingdom Continent would be sure to see a reshuffling of powers among the four divine kingdoms. Gone was the age of the Soul Sea Realm masters, replaced by the emergence of the Life and Death Realm warriors who now had the opportunity to compete and establish a new order.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the world, the same phenomena could not be observed in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>There weren't as many Soul Sea Realm warriors here compared to the Divine Kingdom Continent. Furthermore, the entire place was still in a state of chaos and the two or three Soul Sea Realm masters in each race served as the sole guardians of their people. There was no way they would willingly leave with the imminent threat of extinction by the hands of other races.</p>

  <p>They would not ascend right away but Miguel and the others still discussed the matter quite seriously.</p>

  <p>Everyone took this as good news. It was a great opportunity to ascend and further improve one's self, after all. However, this wasn't the case for Amber.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had been opened completely and there was no doubt that the Sea God Continent would soon see an explosive rise in powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>The human race and the Demon Night race would inevitably become the rulers of the continent considering that they held the reigns within the tower.</p>

  <p>Amber had full confidence in the capacity of the Demon Night race to flourish even without her leadership, so what was stopping her?</p>

  <p>She, of course, desired ascension once. Her talent had been recognized by the Tower of Sin. Even if she had only ranked in the second row of the Talent Tablet, she was definitely an exceptional genius even in the Upper World. She knew she was strong and had unlimited potential that she could utilize to contribute even more to her race if she ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However… The recent circumstances turned this desire into a mere pipe dream.</p>

  <p>Right now, Amber was currently, albeit involuntarily, entangled in the conflict between two queens.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had destroyed the Queen of Punishment's statue twice and even came into a head-on conflict with her. The queen had ordered Amber to kill both Luo Zheng and Xun during that confrontation.</p>

  <p>However, Amber chose to ignore her orders, meaning she committed a capital offense by defying the will of her queen.</p>

  <p>She could imagine a terrible fate waiting for her in the Upper World if she ever chose to ascend at this point in time.</p>

  <p>The fact left a bitter taste in her mouth. Forcibly staying at the Soul Sea Realm all her life wasn't really what she had in mind for herself. She was still quite young, only two hundred years old, and she had ambitions.</p>

  <p>How could someone so powerful and talented such as her be willing to waste her potential in the Lower World?</p>

  <p>But of course, she must face the consequences of her actions.</p>

  <p>The Central Region, meanwhile, had no Soul Sea Realm masters so there was no issue of ascension.</p>

  <p>Still, all sorts of creatures from various places took part in this momentous event. Some came from savage lands, others from the boundless ocean.</p>

  <p>In the midst of it all, Luo Zheng was the only one aware of such an important occasion in the Central Region. Everything was the same in Central Region with its people treating it as a normal day, going about their normal, everyday lives.</p>

  <p>He had already gone through his third life-and-death tribulation.</p>

  <p>As long as the mysterious black eye did not appear, then he was safe.</p>

  <p>The pill the old man gave him also continued to help increase his cultivation base which was of great help to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Time passed. Luo Zheng usually occupied his days cultivating and spending time with his three women but he had also recently started paying attention to the happenings in the four divine kingdoms. He heard that almost all of the Soul Sea Realm warriors had chosen to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>What surprised him was the fact that Fiona, the girl with the Genuine Phoenix bloodline, had ascended as well!</p>

  <p>This initially shocked Luo Zheng but, after some investigation, he found out that she hadn't actually ascended with her own strength.</p>

  <p>Fiona had just reached the Life and Death Realm when the power of the Genuine Phoenix bloodline burst out from her body and produced a special flame. This mysterious flame whisked her away and made her disappear from this world and Luo Zheng guessed that she might've entered a supreme world of the Genuine Phoenix.</p>

  <p>He had promised to visit her in the Divine Kingdom Continent but he didn't think he'd be able to make good on that promise now. The 100, 000 supreme worlds were unimaginably vast and a reunion with Fiona was close to impossible.</p>

  <p>He did not dwell on this and chose to focus on cultivating instead.</p>

  <p>Two years passed. His cultivation base kept rising steadily and Xun's soul was also slowly recovering in the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>As for Brianna…</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had helped her communicate with the cyan dragon several times.</p>

  <p>According to him, there was no way to remove the Soul Sealing Spell while in the Lower World. She would have to return to the Upper World for that.</p>

  <p>However, it would be impossible for Luo Zheng to bring her along once he ascended in the future.</p>

  <p>There was a simple method to send her back through the Dragon Soar Arena but this suggestion of his was quickly shot down by both Brianna and the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Even though Brianna belonged to the Genuine Dragon race, she refused to return due to some conflicts with the other members. When Luo Zheng heard this, he quickly dropped the idea.</p>

  <p>He was left with no choice but to place her body deep inside Cloud Hall and have people guard it closely.</p>

  <p>He would just have to ascend to the Upper World, find a solution, and then return to the Lower World at some point in the future to help her remove the Soul Sealing Spell.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to improve as his cultivation base kept rising rapidly. He soon experienced his fourth life-and-death tribulation, just three months after his third.</p>

  <p>As his cultivation base rose, the intervals between the tribulations grew shorter and shorter.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Luo Zheng had almost wanted to purposely impede the improvement of his cultivation. It was just a peaceful point in his life wherein he could relax and spend as much time as he wanted with his girls. However, there was no stopping his lightning-fast improvement.</p>

  <p>He told himself that he would try to suppress himself from ascending even if he reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>But after his fifth life-and-death tribulation, it seemed that the great world suddenly began to reject him.</p>
