  <p>The salesman wanted to tell Rankin Su that Luo Zheng was rich and generous, but the words got stuck in his throat in his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Rankin! Uncle Rankin! There's a rich man here! Nothing is more important than business, isn't that right?" Gant begged for mercy as Rankin yelled to him non-stop. His ears could take no more of this badgering.</p>

  <p>There were very few actually qualified to enter this inner chamber of the shop, while those who did were usually very rich or very powerful beings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation was so low that Rankin did not take him seriously at first glance. But upon hearing he was in fact a rich man, Rankin's view had changed and he now gave Luo Zheng all his attention. He looked him up and down and said, "The swords here were all built by the blood of our Su Clan. They are very precious, so if you don't have at least one million divine crystals, there's really no sense in us continuing this conversation."</p>

  <p>This sword store didn't actually belong to the Dragon City. The Su Clan were the ones in charge here and thus traded with their customers directly.</p>

  <p>"Swords built by the blood?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed in curiosity.</p>

  <p>Gant puffed with pride and exclaimed, "Yes! We have the blood of the Ore Shadow race, the most excellent bloodline for refining swords!"</p>

  <p>The Ore Shadow race was one of the ancient nonhuman races. Their skin was like brass, and their eyes like mercury. They grew out of the mining mountains, and all parts of their bodies were extremely valuable. It was because of this, that the members of the Ore Shadow race had been completely massacred a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Only the Su Clan inherited their blood.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for the protection of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Su Clan would have been slaughtered by the other races as well, such was the value of their bloodline. And for this protection, the Su Clan had been putting as much effort as they could towards the loyal servitude of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"May I have a look?" Luo Zheng asked of the swords they did not believe he was worthy to behold.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's confidence encouraged Rankin, who then walked to a side and performed a slight waving gesture.</p>

  <p>The wall caved in magically, revealing six long swords and their sharp edges, all evenly spaced from each other. They looked as if they stood as royal guards on duty, so regal and strong.</p>

  <p>The aura coming from them caused Luo Zheng to twitch his eyebrows at their power.</p>

  <p>"These six swords are all Profound Blood Treasures. Even the cheapest one, the Hovering Bird Sword, would cost you a million divine crystals," Rankin said in a clear and proud voice.</p>

  <p>Seeing the seriousness on Luo Zheng's face satisfied him. He took great pride in his store. Impressing those rich and powerful who walked in was what he lived for.</p>

  <p>What he did not realize was that Luo Zheng only seemed to notice one sword. The body of that sword was snake-shaped, looking almost exactly the same as the Soaring Snake Sword!</p>

  <p>"I feel as though I've seen this sword before. It seems to remind me of the legendary Soaring Snake Sword," Luo Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>Gant laughed heartily and admitted, "This is a forgery, a replica of the Soaring Snake Sword. So its power is nowhere near that of the real one.</p>

  <p>You must be quite knowledgeable to recognize the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Not many are capable of that."</p>

  <p>Not entirely the case but how could Gant know that the real Soaring Snake Sword was in Luo Zheng's hand?</p>

  <p>"So this sword is also a Profound Blood Treasure?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"Of course! A sword that has been soaked into the blood of our family, can be called a Profound Blood Treasure. Although it's a primary one, it's still quite powerful if I do say so," declared Gant, searching Luo Zheng's face for impressed emotions.</p>

  <p>"I'll take it," Luo Zheng replied with little hesitation.</p>

  <p>If the counterfeit and the real one were put side by side, even Luo Zheng would have a hard time telling them apart.</p>

  <p>If at some point he had to use the Soaring Snake Sword, he could withdraw the fake one first he supposed.</p>

  <p>"Don't you need to know the price?" Gant pursed his lips. He knew Luo Zheng to be very rich, but he'd never seen someone buy a sword without asking the price. Assuming he could afford it niggled Gant somewhat.</p>

  <p>"This sword will cost you one million and five hundred thousand divine crystals." The ease at which Luo Zheng took the revelation and payment of the price delighted Rankin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paid him what he was owed and glanced at the swords again. "These swords are all Profound Blood Treasures, including the forgery? Then what do you call the real Soaring Snake Sword?" Luo Zheng asked, a little confused.</p>

  <p>"Real Soaring Snake Sword..." Rankin and Gant were both stunned.</p>

  <p>They had expected Luo Zheng would know this which should be common knowledge. Gant then said slowly and with a smile, "After the middle ages, all the magic weapons in the world were classified. There are Profound Blood Treasure, Other Shore Treasure and Grand Nature Treasure, and each of the three types can be sub-categorized into three levels."</p>

  <p>After a pause, Gant continued, "And the real Soaring Snake Sword is a primary Grand Nature Treasure."</p>

  <p>"Only the primary level?" Luo Zheng asked shocked.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was slightly disappointed by this, Rankin and his nephew couldn't help but chuckle. Gant finally let out. "Only the primary level?</p>

  <p>Hahaha The forging of a Grand Nature Treasure requires pristine materials, which came into existence before the chaos had been broken. This is no easy task. There are only dozens of such Grand Nature Treasures in the entire Source World! The reason why the Soaring Snake Sword is 'only' a primary one is because it does not contain that many pristine materials.</p>

  <p>Even so, it's more than enough to cause a massive stir among every race!"</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>As Gant had said, Profound Blood Treasures were sacred weapons forged by noble blood, while Other Shore Treasures contained Other Shore Tokens. As for Grand Nature Treasures, they were made from pristine materials. Such a magical weapon was one in a million, rare and precious beyond compare.</p>

  <p>After getting a general understanding of the treasure classification, Luo Zheng looked up at the wall.</p>

  <p>When Rankin had shown him the six swords, he had noticed two. One was a copy of the Soaring Snake Sword, and the other...</p>

  <p>It appeared ordinary in shape but the blood light it held within made people tremble in fear. Just the faint light of it seemed to be capable of devouring someone in minutes.</p>

  <p>"What's the price of this one?" Luo Zheng asked of this second sword.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng made mention of the sword, Gant's face sank as his heart did too.</p>

  <p>From the blood light, Gant could tell the maker of the sword, the one who had been oppressed for so long. Thinking of how miserable she looked,</p>

  <p>Gant could not help but feel a deep sadness.</p>

  <p>Rankin, on the other hand, was a stark contrast of Gant. He gave Luo Zheng a thumbs up and said, "You're good! This is the Snow Sword. A premium Profound Blood Treasure. It also just so happens to be the best sword in our store! Although this sword doesn't have any Other Shore Tokens, it is comparable to some Other Shore Treasures. The price is eight million divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit startled by the high price.</p>

  <p>However, he was quite fond of this sword, and the fake Soaring Snake Sword was not enough to cope with the enemies he would face. Luo Zheng began reasoning with himself on why he should get this sword. The biggest concern was that he still wanted to spend ten million divine crystals borrowing the yellow paper to study.</p>

  <p>If he bought this sword, he would likely have to find another way to earn even more divine crystals...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and finally said, "I'll take this one too."</p>

  <p>Rankin's eyes widened. He never thought that Luo Zheng would actually buy it.</p>

  <p>This was turning into a great day for him.</p>

  <p>They sold between three to five such swords a year and here Luo Zheng had already bought two at once! Rankin's heart fluttered with excitement and glee and a smile broke onto his face uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>"Great! That's great!" shouted Rankin, who took down the Snow Sword excitedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out the divine crystals and picked up the sword right away.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng held the sword and felt its weight, Gant asked, "Could I have a look at the sword?"</p>

  <p>"Gant! This sword has been sold. It no longer belongs to the Su Clan! Don't cause any trouble!" Rankin scolded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was touched by the gloom that began to fill Gant's eyes. He felt he had no choice but to hand the sword to him for a moment.</p>

  <p>Gant took a deep breath and carefully held the sword in his arms. After a long while, he reluctantly returned the sword to Luo Zheng, at least a little satisfied.</p>
