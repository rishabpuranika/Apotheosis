<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Samuel was not certain that he would succeed, but he decided to give it a go.</p>

  <p>The tip of the Spear of Supreme Harmony had suddenly disappeared, and in no time had integrated with the space.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With a swift motion, it moved and as soon as it touched the thin line, the space was cut apart.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the thin line looked to be dislocated.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel was a bit dissatisfied with the result as he frowned.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed that he had cut the blue thin line, the line was still intact.</p>

  <p>"Not enough. Again."</p>

  <p>He made further calculations on his attack. Since he had made up his mind, there would be no reason to give up.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As he struck another series of attack, the tip of the Spear of Supreme Harmony had slashed the thin line dozens of times.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the crowd, the thin line had already been severely dislocated.</p>

  <p>The part being cut by Samuel was about ten feet away, which could be considered already close enough to damage it, but it didn't break.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Samuel thrust out the Spear of Supreme Harmony dozens of times, his eyes widening with anger.</p>

  <p>The long spear fiercely broke the void.</p>

  <p>A huge hole with a width of ten feet instantly appeared in the void. The blue thin line drilled in from one side of the large hole, and then came out from another. The part in the middle had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>The thin line swayed back and forth on both sides of the hole a few times before finally starting to roll back. Following that, it disappeared in everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Lying in the sea of fire, Zheng was currently absorbing the energy from the two girls.</p>

  <p>Because of Samuel's action, the blue thin line collapsed. One kind of energy had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

  <p>"He has cut off the line!"</p>

  <p>"Cut the line and then we can refine the True Demon Body?"</p>

  <p>"It's a good chance!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods were full of fear that they would be killed by Samuel, so they fled a fair distance away from him. When they saw the change in the void, they were tempted and itched to have a go.</p>

  <p>But they were still rational in the end. They dared not to go forward rashly as they knew how powerful the two girls were, and were even aware that they had to fight Samuel first.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the thin line was cut off, Samuel was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>But he was in for a surprise. As he narrowed his eyes, he saw that the girl with blue eyes was already gone.</p>

  <p>"How dare you steal my thing!" he bellowed and came upon a realization. He realized that the woman had used his clone to move the girl with blue eyes away.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A chill suddenly emerged around the woman. Samuel's clone had brought the girl to her.</p>

  <p>The girl stood blankly in the air, her deep blue eyes filled with anger.</p>

  <p>She was currently in confusion as she was being brought into many space channels. She had no idea what was going on, but she immediately felt irritated and enraged when she realized that her connection with the red eyed girl was suddenly cut off.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do this?" A childish but cold voice was heard.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Ice flowers were rushing out of the blue eyed girl's body and began to rotate crazily.</p>

  <p>'This is bad!' the woman groaned inwardly.</p>

  <p>In order to refine the True Demon Body, she speculated that the line had to be cut off. In turn, it was a mistake on her part.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to her that the blue eyed girl would be infuriated.</p>

  <p>Ice flowers circled frantically around the girl, as if she were a goddess of ice and snow, and any creature that approached her would be frozen and torn apart.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Right before the girl's attack approached them, Samuel's clone acted fast and once again used the Spear of Supreme Harmony to create a space channel. He disappeared together with the woman.</p>

  <p>But the other Holy Beings' clones were not that lucky.</p>

  <p>The moment the ice flowers hit them, they were frozen and turned into human ice sculptures. The attack didn't stop as more ice flowers hit the ice sculptures. They were instantly crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>They died just like that and turned into Faith Energy which quickly vanished into the thin air in the void.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy had originally been extracted from many fiends and fierce beasts by the woman, and now it was returned to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"Break you into pieces!"</p>

  <p>The blue eyed girl's indifferent face had become ruthless and full of killing intent.</p>

  <p>Samuel, along with members of the alliance of the powerful clans was eager for action, but seeing her powerful strength made them take a step back.</p>

  <p>Their hearts were beating wildly.</p>

  <p>If they had rushed to her without thinking, they would have been turned into pieces of ice.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The ice flowers were spinning faster and faster, and the impact range became wider. The blue light in the girl's eyes was getting brighter.</p>

  <p>The turbulent cold air spread quickly in the void, as if a snowy storm was coming.</p>

  <p>Looking at the ice flowers, some people felt deeply afraid that they would spread to the entire void. Would everyone be killed by the snowstorm?</p>

  <p>They couldn't do anything as they waited in alert. The pressure in the air was growing intense but when the light in the girl's eyes reached a certain extent, it rapidly began to fade.</p>

  <p>All the ice flowers disappeared at the same time.</p>

  <p>The girl stood still as she looked at her own hands, and tilted her head slightly. Her face showed a thoughtful expression, as if she did not understand what just happened.</p>

  <p>"She's running out of energy?"</p>

  <p>"The two girls complement each other. The energy of the blue eyed girl is from the red eyed girl. Since the line has been cut off, her energy can't be replenished."</p>

  <p>"Now, we can approach her!"</p>

  <p>Some people from the crowd had understood what was going on, and a few of consummate True Gods began to gather around her.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes lit up at that moment. He turned into a streak of light and rushed away.</p>

  <p>As the head of the Holy Beings, he didn't use all his strength after he was trapped in this place because Samuel had suppressed him.</p>

  <p>He felt aggrieved as he knew that Samuel had the great advantage over the others due to the Spear of Supreme Harmony. And the worst was Samuel was able to pry into his memories, which had greatly limited himself.</p>

  <p>He had endured for so long and did not make a serious move yet. He had been waiting and planning for the right time and opportunity.</p>

  <p>Now that he had gotten the chance to refine the blue eyed girl, how could he let her fall into Samuel's hands?</p>

  <p>He moved as fast as he could but yet was still a step behind. No matter how fast he went, he couldn't catch up with the woman and Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Samuel and his clone thrust out the Spear of Supreme Harmony almost at the same time, and two space channels enveloped the blue eyed girl.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Under the collision of the two space channels, a serrated pattern appeared in the void and vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Samuel swung the Spear of Supreme Harmony to the air.</p>

  <p>This time he made sure that he would be half a step ahead. He managed to envelop the blue eyed girl in the space channel and sent her into the void a few dozen miles away.</p>

  <p>In the distance, Pascal was floating. He was still under Samuel's control and was waiting for the opportunity.</p>

  <p>Seeing the girl come out of the void, Pascal stepped forward to hug her.</p>

  <p>Just before he could lay a hand on the girl, a ray of extremely sharp sword radiance flew over from a thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>If he didn't retreat in time, he would be cut in half by the sword radiance.</p>
