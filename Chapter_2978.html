<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2978 Entering The Excellence City </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Evil God stood still while he gazed out into the world. It was as if he was feeling the pulse of the new world.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng found it hard to guess what the Evil God thought. He believed that this brand new world was a good starting point for Evil God.</p>

  <p>"I could see the isolated and barren desert over there, and there is a big city.</p>

  <p>Where is this place?" the Evil God asked. His question forced Luo Zheng to pause for a while.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, I am not too sure." Luo Zheng squinted at once then shook his head, oblivious to the question.</p>

  <p>"You don't know either?" The Evil God stared at Luo Zheng in disbelief and shuffled backward a few steps, both hands clasped behind his back.</p>

  <p>For the time being, Luo Zheng found it hard to explain the relationship between the Source World, the divine land, the universe, and the chaos. He replied,</p>

  <p>"Yeah, because it's also the first time that I have set foot in this place, just like you. You can call it the Source World, which is also the biggest world!"</p>

  <p>"Is there any other world outside apart from this one?" the Evil God inquired further, eager to discover more.</p>

  <p>"There is, known as the chaos," Luo Zheng stated, matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, absorbed in his thought, fell silent. "Is there another world beyond the chaos?" he continued to ask.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. "I don't know."</p>

  <p>The problem involved appeared simple, but it covered the category of philosophy. Luo Zheng's knowledge of the entire world was confined within the vast chaos.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's face showed no sign of disappointment despite the lack of decent answers from Luo Zheng. He felt relieved after his greatest ambition happened. He finally broke free from Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Since this case is unresolved, I will explore and find the answers myself.</p>

  <p>Let's end there!" The Evil God smiled as he obligingly bowed before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But at the back of his mind, he could not stop thinking how much he wanted to be far away from him.</p>

  <p>His body then diffused wisps of the internal momentum from both Spiritual Wind Godly Way and Thunderstorm Godly Way. Once the two magical forces mixed, it formed a unique theurgy beyond these two Divine Dao - the Wind Thunder Escape Skill he had created himself.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Equipped with the escape skill, the Evil God flew along the river and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The Evil God maintained great respect for Luo Zheng on the surface even though he felt absolute animosity towards him. He reasoned that if his inner world had remained the same and never shifted into a "Rebirth Land", they would have exchanged blows by then!</p>

  <p>"He avoided the Sweltering Desert and hesitated to go to the Excellence City. Instead, he preferred to follow the water. He is too clever for me," Luo Zheng muttered to himself. "I wonder if fate will allow us to meet again?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that the likes of Evil God, armed with intelligence and skills, often succeeded by performing greater things. Determined to make a voice in the Source World, he could earn himself a noble status and a chance to sit on top of the hierarchy.</p>

  <p>After standing motionless for a while, Luo Zheng headed towards Excellence City.</p>

  <p>The divine cities in the divine land were guarded by the slates, so they had become places of valuable resources for cultivation and those warriors who wanted to gain access to those divine cites had to pay certain amount of divine might coins. By contrast, the Excellence City, a big city in the Source World was an open city that was accessible to anyone.</p>

  <p>Shortly after Luo Zheng showed up at the city gate, he noticed countless divine citizens come and go in an endless flow.</p>

  <p>He took a glimpse of the fiercest warriors among the multitude of divine citizens. A significant number were at the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm. To add, rare faces of True Gods blended with the huge crowd.</p>

  <p>Despite the perils involved, Luo Zheng did not hide his strength. It was even more dangerous if he concealed his powers in an unfamiliar environment. He wanted to fend off suspicions in case he got noticed.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng examined the surroundings, he walked without the slightest hesitation into Excellence City together with other divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Once inside the city, he felt several spiritual senses sweep past him. Judging from the strength of energy Luo Zheng picked up, whoever released these forces should have Souls of Light. This meant that they were at least consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>It perplexed Luo Zheng where these spiritual senses originated, so he pretended not to know. He strolled through the open streets and scrutinized the place.</p>

  <p>If Emily and her companions escaped the man in white, they should have already reached the Excellence City. Luo Zheng wondered if Emily, Leopold, and the rest left behind any mark or alternative means of contact.</p>

  <p>But soon Luo Zheng pushed that possibility aside. There were just simply too many divine citizens and buildings in the Excellence City. Even the central divine cities in the divine land couldn't compare to this city.</p>

  <p>It appeared necessary for him to stay in Excellence City for a period of time. He needed to find a way to collect some substantial information.</p>

  <p>He hesitated to stick around. If he failed to get any news of Emily and the others here, would this mean that he would be stuck in this city for a long time? This was certainly not what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt distressed when suddenly he heard a faint voice murmur, "Friend, what brought you here to the Excellence City?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tensed up, furrowed his eyebrows, and spun around. His gaze landed on a long-haired youthful man who sat on the second floor of a building several thousand feet away. This individual was at the consummation of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>This was the first consummate True God that Luo Zheng had found in the Source World.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's mind, there should exist many powerful masters in the Source World and even someone like Emily was not the strongest.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he thought that there might be tons of consummate True Gods in the Source World. But what he saw now in Excellence City contradicted on what he imagined.</p>

  <p>"I'm just passing by," Luo Zheng responded through pursed lips using chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The young man showed a half-smile but shook his head and said to Luo Zheng,</p>

  <p>"Whether you are just passing by or staying for a while, I insist that you join me up here for a chat!"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng sped up to the building. In a split second, he arrived on top of the stairs and sat opposite the young man.</p>

  <p>"My name is Kenelm Lai. And may I ask you what is yours?" The young man gently cupped his hands towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned a salute. "Luo Zheng Luo," came the reply.</p>

  <p>The answer stunned Kenelm. "Your surname is Luo? It is remarkably rare..."</p>

  <p>Although the divine land inherited its cultural heritage from the Source World, they still differed in some aspects. In most clans, natural birth established family names. The surname Luo long existed in the divine land, but Kenelm heard it from Luo Zheng the first time in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why you invited me here?" Luo Zheng probed while scratching his head, looking confused.</p>

  <p>With a vague hint of a smile, Kenelm confessed, "It's rare to see any consummate True God come to this city. Since you have come here, I believe some people have noticed you and are ready to contact you, but I'd say that I was lucky to have a chat with you ahead."</p>

  <p>The young man caught Luo Zheng off guard with this unusual announcement.</p>

  <p>Listening to Kenelm made him consider how sought-after he would be in Excellence City. He doubted this since he was only a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reflected on the incident earlier when the spiritual senses scanned him the moment he stepped into the city. This convinced him it could be true.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng proceeded after breaking free from his thoughts. "I am just passing by Excellence City, and I have no intention of staying here or joining any forces." But he sounded more defensive than convincing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng faced him with an upfront rejection even before Kenelm could offer anything. Bitter disappointment reflected on his face.</p>

  <p>Recently, the peace and balance in Excellence City got disrupted. Kenelm found it essential if he could secure the help of another consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng continued, "I have something to ask you."</p>

  <p>When Kenelm heard that Luo Zheng needed to inquire something, he got intrigued.</p>

  <p>With brows elevated, he urged, "What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Were there any Other Shore Realm warriors who entered Excellence City recently?" Luo Zheng asked quietly.</p>
