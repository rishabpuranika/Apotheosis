<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2258 The Origin Of The Purple Power World </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It did not surprise Joy when Luo Zheng employed the first stage of Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>It proved not difficult for Luo Zheng to comprehend and practice the basic skill of the Power Shaping through the Might Godly Way. He had mastered so many Godly Ways, and could cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Learning the second stage of the Power Shaping, which required the warrior to have extensive understanding of the power, was a challenge.</p>

  <p>The power of the Eight Path Platforms was obviously not enough to help Luo Zheng master the second stage. That was why Joy was astonished when he actually did it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had even been able to let the long sword, which was formed by the power, fly. It was inconceivable!</p>

  <p>Even a consummate True God would be unable to do that, no matter if they had formed the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>Once the power was used and released by the one who controlled it, it would become complete chaos and out of control. It was another reason brute power was not valued in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Once one reached the cultivation level that Joy was at, they could give full play to their power after using the Cross-world Theurgy. However, Holy Beings normally did not need that kind of pure power. It was why Holy Jay had destroyed the nine stars after creating the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. He had poured the strength source into a large pool, and gave some of it to others from time to time.</p>

  <p>If someone was at a low cultivation level, they couldn't use the power.</p>

  <p>When they were at a higher cultivation level, however, there was no need to use the power. It was an embarrassment of the body refiners.</p>

  <p>Joy had made an exception in this case though.</p>

  <p>She fused the Nine Divine Stars with her inner world. Her inner world was the Purple Sky Land, and had been built through the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way. This meant that it was not an intact universe, so she would only become a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Joy didn't have a complete universe, she owned an omnipotent Cross-world Theurgy. From her understanding of the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way, she was able to use all her strength to create a massive invisible sword array. The additional strength she had left was used to give full play to the Cross-world Theurgy, and the Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>It was Joy's most powerful skill, and she had the utmost confidence in it.</p>

  <p>In all her experience and knowledge, that far surpassed any ordinary True Gods, she never thought that what was occurring in front of her would ever be possible. She might just be a Demi-holy Being, but she was still incredibly powerful. The fact that a proving godly warrior was so easily able to do that blew her mind.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a long while before mumbling, "No wonder. Judging by your performance in the Arena of Legends, it is still difficult for you to kill Sheridan. It is even more impossible for you to hurt Langston.</p>

  <p>Now I see the reason."</p>

  <p>When Joy's words reached his ears, Luo Zheng sighed. He knew Joy was indeed an outstanding Demi-holy Being with considerable insight. Even though she had not seen Luo Zheng fight Langston, she still knew why he had been able to hurt Langston.</p>

  <p>"Since you're going to teach me the Power Shaping, will I reach the level as high as yours?" Luo Zheng asked once more.</p>

  <p>Zheng's control of the strength source was limited. He didn't exert the Cross-world Theurgy to its fullest power. Joy was the top master in this field. Luo Zheng would never miss such a good opportunity to learn a great skill from the master. After all, it would make Luo Zheng more confident to face the low-rank True Gods with high rankings in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>Joy's expression became disdainful.</p>

  <p>Although the Power Shaping was the theurgy beyond the Strength Godly Way, there were many people practicing it. Joy had managed to become a Demi-holy Being because of it, and that had its own advantages.</p>

  <p>She had only planned to teach Luo Zheng the simple Power Shaping. There had been no intention for her to teach him the second stage, let alone the third stage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might call her master, but he wasn't her disciple at all.</p>

  <p>However, it might prove to be a good decision to take Luo Zheng, Mike's son, as a disciple.</p>

  <p>"I have never imparted this theurgy to outsiders, but if you become my disciple, I will consider teaching you," said Joy.</p>

  <p>If Joy's disciples could build the Purple Sky Land, their strength would improve greatly. Their possibility of becoming a Demi-holy Being was much higher than that of an ordinary top-rank True God. Unfortunately, up to now, no disciples had built the Purple Sky Land, and no one could get the real supreme skills Joy had.</p>

  <p>Now though, an excellent candidate had popped up. Luo Zheng was only a proving godly warrior, but he possessed all the conditions for cultivating Joy's theurgy. In most cases, such conditions shouldn't even appear on a True God at all, let alone a proving godly warrior. The fact Luo Zheng showed this amount of promise surprised Joy.</p>

  <p>Joy was obviously interested in Luo Zheng becoming her disciple.</p>

  <p>"I have a master. My master is Bromley Gu," Luo Zheng answered simply.</p>

  <p>Since Joy already knew his identity, he didn't worry about revealing more information to her.</p>

  <p>A look of frustration crossed her face. She should have thought about it earlier. Bromley and Mike used to be on good terms, and now that Mike had suffered, it was impossible for Bromley not to help him.</p>

  <p>"But if you can teach me this unique skill, I will practice it painstakingly," Luo Zheng said with a smile. At this stage, he didn't dare use the Emotion Closing Godly Way, or let the chaotic energy be revealed so easily. Furthermore, the Enemy Repelling Arts, which could cut off cause and effect, was useless in the divine land. Although there was also the Law of Causality in the divine land, the divine land wasn't the universe. Mike had created the Enemy Repelling Arts in order to cut the cause and destroy the effect. However, the divine land was not built by Mike, and the power would be useless here.</p>

  <p>Joy's stare became hard as steel. Since Luo Zheng was Mike's son, she would make an exception, but she was disappointed by this outcome. "In that case, I can teach you the Gods Killing Sword Array," she said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"What? The Gods Killing Sword Array?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"You've heard of it?" Joy asked, staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although she was a Demi-holy Being, Joy did not have the privilege of going in and out of the Hall of Holy Beings like the Holy Emperors of Floating Islands did. During the war within the Evolutionary Universe, She worried for Mike's safety, but the Hall of Holy Beings had shut down at that time, so she was unable to get in touch with the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan. Even the upper Floating Islands shut doors to the outside.</p>

  <p>After the war in the universe had ended, the Evolutionary Universe was now safe and sound. Murphy had been punished as the antagonist of the universe war, and for violating the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Learning of this news had made Joy incredibly happy. However, she was in the dark as to the process and the details of the battle between the Murphy Universe and the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she naturally had no idea that Mu Ning had used the Gods Killing Sword Array in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng said softly.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was thinking, he realized there was something strange going on.</p>

  <p>There had to be some kind of connection here.</p>

  <p>Although the Purple Power World in the Evolutionary Universe was incomplete, it was very similar to the Purple Sky Land. Mu Ning started to cultivate the sword array in the Purple Power World, and she had mastered the Gods Killing Sword Array in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>What was the connection then?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was considering his inner thoughts, Joy became overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"If you have truly seen the Gods Killing Sword Array, then it couldn't be in the divine land. It must be in the Evolutionary Universe! According to the original agreement, there is a warrior with the first-rank Purple Power Body in the Purple Power World!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did indeed possess the first-rank Purple Power Body. However, the rank division of the Purple Power Body in the Evolutionary Universe seemed to be different than that of the divine land. At least he hadn't heard that the Purple Power Bodies of the disciples in the Purple Soul Hall would be divided into several ranks.</p>

  <p>Joy's words seemed to dredge up a lot of memories for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World was special and incomplete supreme world.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Evolutionary Universe did not completely rule over this supreme world, and the Purple Power World hadn't seemed to have undergone the great extinction during the recurrent grand eras.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was lost in thought for a long while, and when he came to the conclusion he looked at Joy. Joy knew what Luo Zheng wanted to confirm, so she said, "You're right. The Purple Power World is where I resided before. Your father has specially created it for me, and the Gods Killing Sword Array was created by your father and me. I have promised him that if a warrior with the first-rank Purple Power Body in the Evolutionary Universe existed, I would naturally let this warrior inherit the Gods Killing Sword Array. But I am not sure how Mike has arranged this matter."</p>

  <p>She paused to collect her thoughts, curiosity flitting across her face. "As you have seen the Gods Killing Sword Array, you must know who is the one to employ it. Who is it? Does that warrior travel to the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a moment to think.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng stole into the divine land, he had been staying in the Vast Sky Region. He had been confused as to why he had reached the Han Clan's territory, but now he understood that this was his father's intention. His father hoped that he could rely on Joy.</p>

  <p>He placed a finger on his nose, and replied unnaturally quietly, "The one who has displayed the Gods Killing Sword Array is my wife."</p>
