<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the records, the four kings had been on good terms and trusted each other.</p>

  <p>Any creature in the Four Spirits Sect could have a try to obtain the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>After the strength of the Four Spirits Sect increased, they began to expand and enlarge their scale.</p>

  <p>Their demand for ancestry-level bloodline also grew in return.</p>

  <p>However, merging with the ancestry-level bloodline could only be done by a small number of the talents in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the members tried many times, but they all resulted in failure.</p>

  <p>However, there was one attempt that marked a turning point? Kincaid's.</p>

  <p>He had divided the ancestry-level bloodline with a not very complicated method.</p>

  <p>For experiments, the human spirits captured a large number of snow-white mice with wings called Heron Mice. These mice were pinned down and forcibly injected with the ancestry-level blood.</p>

  <p>The energy contained in the ancestry-level bloodline was overwhelming, making it unbearable for the mice.</p>

  <p>The only consequence for them after absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline was to explode and die.</p>

  <p>The experiments yielded the same results repeatedly.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, tens of billions of Heron Mice thrived in the forest closest to the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits in the Monkey Spirit Sect had the most important task of capturing the mice for decades.</p>

  <p>Nearly a million mice had died from all the experiments when, finally, one of them managed to survive.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because the mouse was special, but because the ancestry-level bloodline had become "tired".</p>

  <p>In the beginning, both Cornelius and Sheehan believed the power of the ancestry-level bloodline to be inexhaustible, but Kincaid didn't agree. He felt that everything had its limits.</p>

  <p>Orlando himself was not interested in the mystery of the ancestry-level bloodline. He was also unwilling to learn about it, so he blindly agreed with Kincaid.</p>

  <p>Only the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect supported the research on the ancestry-level bloodline. The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect showed no concern with it.</p>

  <p>When Kincaid injected the ancestry-level bloodline into the body of the Heron Mouse, he keenly sensed the slight change that occurred in the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The inexhaustible energy of the ancestry-level bloodline had proved unsuitable for the fusion before.</p>

  <p>He assumed that this kind of ability of the ancestry-level bloodline could be considered as a kind of poison, the poison of rejection, but the poison had limitations.</p>

  <p>After causing countless mice's death, its toxicity had weakened. The ancestry-level bloodline finally yielded and successfully merged into the mouse's body.</p>

  <p>The mouse instantly changed. It started to breathe heavily and moved as if it wanted to break free.</p>

  <p>It displayed an incredible skill from the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>At that time, whoever could obtain the ability of the ancestry-level bloodline would immediately become a powerhouse.</p>

  <p>Both the mouse's strength and speed greatly increased. After the experiment, it managed to attack three human spirits and killed them all. It planned to escape afterward, but Kincaid came to restrain and take it under his control.</p>

  <p>Kincaid was overjoyed. He delighted at the thought of his success.</p>

  <p>The poison of rejection had only been his speculation, yet it proved true.</p>

  <p>He had proudly created a new bloodline from the mouse.</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit Sect called this new bloodline the source bloodline.</p>

  <p>The source bloodline had an ability of the ancestry-level bloodline but it was incomplete.</p>

  <p>Some of the source bloodlines had inherited only one-tenth of a single ability, while some had two-tenth.</p>

  <p>Compared to the abilities given by the ancestry-level bloodline, the source bloodlines were not that powerful, but they were highly adaptable.</p>

  <p>The majority of the spirits in the Four Spirits Sect were able to fuse with this source bloodline.</p>

  <p>There were only a small number of talented warriors who could merge with the ancestry-level bloodline before.</p>

  <p>But everyone could now use the ancestry-level bloodline. The members of the Four Spirits Sect shouted and jumped for joy when they found out about the news.</p>

  <p>However, Kincaid only allowed the members of the Monkey Spirit Sect to fuse with this source bloodline.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed as he attentively listened beside Zheng,</p>

  <p>"This must be the core problem."</p>

  <p>"The Four Spirits Sect was an integral whole. It's undeniable that the Monkey Spirit Sect made great contributions, but the fact that Kincaid showed favoritism for this sect would surely bring a conflict," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit Sect's contribution to producing the source bloodline from the ancestry-level bloodline had always been recognized. After all, it was because of their tireless capture of the mice that Kincaid's experiments were pushed through.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect felt angry with the way things turned out.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't express their emotions at the time, they might in the future.</p>

  <p>This was one of the matters that affected the harmony of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>They continued to capture a large number of mice even after creating the source bloodline.</p>

  <p>After the two millionth mouse died, Kincaid obtained the second source bloodline as expected. Its ability was completely different from the first one.</p>

  <p>Then came more and more source bloodlines which all displayed different abilities.</p>

  <p>During the process, however, the number of mice in the forest plummeted.</p>

  <p>Their bones piled up into mountains in the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Although he had acquired many, Kincaid grew dissatisfied with the power of the source bloodlines.</p>

  <p>It was because the source bloodlines could only release one-tenth or two-tenths of an ability of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Their strength wasn't enough? they were simply too weak.</p>

  <p>To solve this problem, Kincaid gathered the smartest men among the human spirits for a discussion. The sun rose and set for many days, and then they finally came to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>The mice were naturally weak, which determined their weak abilities even after they'd absorbed source bloodlines.</p>

  <p>To obtain powerful source bloodlines, they had to use powerful creatures as well.</p>

  <p>The main world didn't have many powerful creatures, leaving the Four Spirits Sect with few choices.</p>

  <p>They explored and hunted, which led them to several selected targets.</p>

  <p>Among these were numerous ants of several hundred feet in size and black midges.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect agreed that capturing these creatures was difficult, but they appreciated the human spirits' efforts and asked their members to join them in working.</p>

  <p>The division of labor in the Four Spirits Sect led to a great improvement in their efficiency.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the experiments were carried out with the powerful creatures.</p>

  <p>Everything went smoothly. After about one hundred thousand ants died, Kincaid once again obtained a much stronger source bloodline.</p>

  <p>It had possessed forty percent of a single ability of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Kincaid named it root-level bloodline, and the previous one was named the source-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>With the popularity of the source-level and the root-level bloodlines in the Four Spirits Sect, their strength excelled once again.</p>

  <p>They were able to produce elites in batches which could only be resisted by very few races in the main world.</p>

  <p>Even so, Kincaid remained dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>He aspired to obtain a much stronger bloodline, or better, to figure out a method to directly fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, he had not fulfilled this wish because of the absence of both an extremely powerful and populous race in the main world.</p>
