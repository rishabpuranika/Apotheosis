<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Solid Lightning Powder was undoubtedly powerful. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had used it to kill the Divine Retribution Beast that had once hunted the human race.</p>

  <p>The terrifying lightning exploded, radiating in all directions like a supernova.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The explosion was so loud that it started sounding like a piercing shriek, leaving everyone's ears ringing.</p>

  <p>For a moment, no one could see clearly. They could only see a white light.</p>

  <p>Everything was shrouded in the white light, including the earth and sky.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the white light dissipated, making everything visible again.</p>

  <p>The Earthly Dragon Snakes were gone. A large part of them were killed by the lightning released by the Solid Lightning Powder. The others fell to the ground: some killed by the shock waves, some just stunned unconscious.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the Heavenly Eye Vine now rushed forward.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits had already arrived a little way ahead of Zheng's group. They had been about to attack when they were spooked still by the lightning in the sky.</p>

  <p>"What kind of skill was that?"</p>

  <p>"What horrible lightning!"</p>

  <p>"The color and power looked familiar. Did they bring the lightning from the Heavenly Thunder Plain?"</p>

  <p>Because of the lightning, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men had hesitated to approach Zheng's group. The Heavenly Eye Vine wasted no time taking advantage of the lull and climbed up to the fifth stair.</p>

  <p>"Should we stop them?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit asked.</p>

  <p>"What if they use that lightning skill again?" the bull-headed man with golden horns said with a frown.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit thought for a moment. "Let's just follow them for now. Let's wait and see if other races will attack them."</p>

  <p>Most of the races in the Grand Pure Realm were chasing Zheng's group. If the races that didn't know their true strength exhausted them, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men would be able to catch them easily. This was a much safer plan.</p>

  <p>"Good idea," the bull-headed man with golden horns agreed.</p>

  <p>The two races thus decided not to stop Zheng and the others themselves.</p>

  <p>Instead, they maintained a certain distance from them and followed them all the way.</p>

  <p>The width of the fifth stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was less than a tenth of that of the first stair, and the sixth stair was even narrower. The seventh stair was a platform of hundreds of thousands of feet wide. The Heavenly Eye Vine quickly passed through the fifth stair and went straight to the sixth.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Sky Ladder Plateau, a large number of creatures from other races began to pour in. More and more races joined the chase.</p>

  <p>They didn't cooperate with each other as the Eternal Realm Hunters thought. Time was short and they hated each other very much. Although everyone's goal was to catch Zheng and his group, they were also still wary against each other.</p>

  <p>Even two races that were approaching together maintained a considerable distance from each other.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>The temperature at the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau started to drop. Thick snow had piled up on the plain, covering everything in a blanket of white.</p>

  <p>After passing the sixth stair, the Heavenly Eye Vine climbed up rapidly along the mountain sides of the seventh.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others now looked a little nervous.</p>

  <p>If the wind blew from the Purple Wind Gorge, the Sky Ladder Plateau would be a dead end. There would be no possibility of escape.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Eye Vine reached the seventh stair, Thurston, Sawyer, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess held their breath and looked worriedly ahead.</p>

  <p>There was a huge and open valley in the distance.</p>

  <p>In the valley, they could see a faint purple wind floating up and down like silk.</p>

  <p>"The wind is rising," Fuxi murmured.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess frowned. This was a difficult problem she could find no solution for.</p>

  <p>A feeling of doom hung over Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>They couldn't cross the Purple Wind Gorge if the wind raged at them.</p>

  <p>All the creatures in the air would be sucked into the deep gorge, and there was no possibility of survival.</p>

  <p>The wind in the Purple Wind Gorge was famously insurmountable.</p>

  <p>"Can't we fly above it?" Zheng asked, staring at the purple wind.</p>

  <p>Pearson scoffed at that. He couldn't imagine how Zheng became so powerful while knowing so little about the Three Purities Stage. "If you fly over the Purple Wind Gorge, the purple wind will blow up. As long as the wind blows, this is a dead end. You shouldn't have chosen this path in the first place."</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others frowned. Their faces darkened as they realized they had made a mistake.</p>

  <p>"I see." Zheng raised his eyebrows but didn't look flustered at all.</p>

  <p>"How ignorant you are!" Pearson felt even more embittered now. He regretted that he had sympathized with Thurston and Sawyer and followed these humans.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine knew what they were talking about, but it remained silent. From the moment it handed over its life source, it no longer had control over itself.</p>

  <p>Not long after they arrived at the edge of the Purple Wind Gorge, they spotted some creatures climbing up the stair.</p>

  <p>There was a group of palm-sized but fully armed mouse-shaped creatures.</p>

  <p>There were dozens of other creatures covered in the mist.</p>

  <p>There were four giants like withered trees, more than two hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>There were two kings of Diabolic Demons radiating with murderous intent.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits also showed up.</p>

  <p>But this time, they did not charge in.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit had been betting on the other races to tire out Zheng and his group, but they were not so stupid.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng and his group were wanted by the Element Spirit Civilization, they knew they were definitely not weak.</p>

  <p>"You destroyed the Diabolic Earth and killed my clansmen, you brat! You'll pay for that today!" One of the Diabolic Demons took two steps forward, looking like he could swallow Zheng in one gulp.</p>

  <p>When the other creatures heard this, their expressions changed slightly.</p>

  <p>"The Diabolic Earth has been destroyed?" one of the giants asked carefully.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Earth was now as quiet as death. No one dared to go and have a look, so only a few people knew about it.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" The Diabolic Demons didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"Did they destroy it?" the giant pressed.</p>

  <p>"Yes! It's that brat!" The king gritted his teeth and pointed at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the creatures started to stir uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Demons were among the top three most powerful races in the Grand Pure Realm. It was near impossible to kill them.</p>

  <p>All this time, they thought Zheng, who had defeated Hawley, just had a powerful physique.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the information they got was completely inaccurate.</p>

  <p>Although surprised at this development, the creatures did not retreat. After all, they still had the advantage of numbers.</p>

  <p>However, they were all now waiting for another to take action first. Even the Diabolic Demons could only seethe in silence and glare at Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were left in a stalemate.</p>

  <p>All the people on the Heavenly Eye Vine looked grave, while Zheng remained composed.</p>

  <p>The stalemate was broken moments later, however, as Zheng sensed something. He suddenly looked at the Purple Wind Gorge behind him.</p>

  <p>"Master Fuxi, please get the Solid Lightning Powder ready."</p>
