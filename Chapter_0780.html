<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The abyss was like a giant chimney, with all platforms distributed on the same level.</p>

  <p>Right now, there were many people standing on the platforms.</p>

  <p>The powerful voice came from one side of Zheng's platform.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows went up as he realized that it was Eddie.</p>

  <p>The people from the Cloud Hall became nervous when they saw Eddie.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the Cloud Hall and Eddie were at a stalemate because of the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>They were safe in the Cloud Hall because they had the Small Circulation Killing Array to protect them. If the situation arose that Cloud Hall had to fight Eddie, how would they be able to defend themselves?</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed coldly at Eddie's words. "What an honor!" he sneered.</p>

  <p>The three obese men and the Ancient Tycoon from the World Commercial Alliance appeared in another area along with many elders of the alliance.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw that Xiao was one of them.</p>

  <p>Xiao was a warrior who was already old, but had been unable to reach a higher level. Such warriors would be out searching for a lucky chance, hoping to break through and extend their lifespan. After all, a single gamble like this could result in hundreds of years of life. If the worst came to the worst, they would die. If they lived a peaceful life, however, they would also die eventually. This was something that warriors or those who had reached their level didn't want to face.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Shi, Mr. Yan, Mr. Mo," Yudie greeted and nodded to the three heads of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall was on good terms with the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>What was more, the alliance's Ancient Tycoon had also come this time. If they were to help each other, they wouldn't need to be afraid of Eddie.</p>

  <p>The people from the Cloud Hall calmed down when they saw that those from the alliance had arrived.</p>

  <p>Soon after, more people came. The leaders and elders of Bloodwood Cliff and Black Mountain Sect also appeared on the platforms.</p>

  <p>Amidst all these, there was one strange area with only one platform being occupied, by a middle-aged martial artist who had also reached the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors at the Life and Death Realm in the Central Region was small and this person was unknown, causing everyone to look him over, trying to measure him up.</p>

  <p>Eddie was also shocked. He felt that this warrior's strength wasn't any weaker than his. So he raised his voice to ask him, "Sir, may I ask which part of Central Region do you come from?"</p>

  <p>Once the warrior had made it onto the platform, he discovered that there was an unbreakable barrier around him. So he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes, hoping to rest. Hearing Eddie's voice directed at him, he opened his eyes and looked at Eddie rather sneeringly, "Ho-ho. You're Eddie Cui, the Evil East Lord, the strongest warrior in the Central Region, but you don't know me?"</p>

  <p>Eddie frowned. That was not a compliment. There was even a hint of provocation, but sadly, Eddie had no idea who this person was.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged warrior smiled coldly and said, "I ran eight thousand miles day and night because four million people were after me. I wonder if Eddie, the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the Cloud Hall, and the World Commercial Alliance remember me."</p>

  <p>Almost everyone's eyebrows shot up, their eyes bugging out of their sockets in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Yudie pursed her lips as she said coldly, "So it's him."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" Zheng asked, baffled at this. Eight thousand miles? Four million people?</p>

  <p>"Poison King, Simon Wu. Back then, he was only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. As he obtained the secret book, the Scripture of Five Poisons, he was chased down by many warriors of the Central Region. The World Commercial Alliance had teamed up with many major sects and offered a reward of millions of supreme life vitality crystals. A warrior who found clues about Simon would also receive a rich reward, so people throughout the Central Region began to hunt him down. But he had practiced and mastered a lot of poisoning martial arts according to the Scripture of Five Poisons. He was hunted for more than eight thousand miles by millions of warriors. But he was still able to escape in the end," Yudie whispered. "But I didn't participate in the hunting because I was still young back then."</p>

  <p>"You were still young at the time? How old are you now, Tia?" Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Yudie glared at Zheng, replying defiantly, "I'm older than you. That's all you need to know!"</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned at Yudie's obvious anger and embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Eddie smiled coldly, "So it's you! I have never thought that you could actually pick up the pieces of your life after you escaped. After you used the world's most poisonous technique to escape from my attack, I knew that you were a very lucky person. Impressive!"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! I was forced into the Dreamy Swampland by you and had to live the life of a savage there. As time went by, I became someone who was barely alive. Once I obtain the legacy of Mist, I will massacre the entire Central Region, exterminating all the fourth and fifth-grade sects, and establishing my own sacred place!" Simon said coldly.</p>

  <p>Eddie raised an eyebrow, but he only chuckled, and did not say anything.</p>

  <p>Although Simon was very strong, he could not match Eddie. Moreover, this guy was not targeting him alone. He obviously hated the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the World Commercial Alliance, and the Cloud Hall to the core. Why would Eddie have to bear his anger alone?</p>

  <p>The members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the Cloud Hall, and the World Commercial Alliance all looked vigilant. The conflict from back then was still fresh in their minds, and Simon's appearance was not good news for them.</p>

  <p>Two more people appeared on the platforms, a woman, who was dressed in black, and a handsome man.</p>

  <p>The woman in black had only reached the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, while the handsome man was at the mid-level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. They looked around arrogantly as they appeared on the platforms. The woman said disdainfully, "Are they warriors of the Sky Northern Region?"</p>

  <p>"Sky Northern Region?" Eddie, who was the closest to the woman, was taken aback at her words. "You are from a divine kingdom?"</p>

  <p>Eddie's words attracted the attention of everyone in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>There were actually martial artists from the divine kingdom present here?</p>

  <p>This meant that one of the nine lamps was in the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Ant, you have no right to ask me questions," the woman said coldly.</p>

  <p>Eddie's face darkened, his face contracting in anger as he stared at her.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"She called you an ant. What's wrong with that? I think it's an honorific title. You should feel honored," the handsome man said with a sardonic smile.</p>

  <p>A surge of energy erupted from Eddie's body, but was blocked by the jade green barrier at the side of the platform. Eddie had suffered too many setbacks these past days. Zheng had killed Marilyn before Eddie's eyes in the Martial Arts Contest. After that, he had hidden behind the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array to humiliate him. Now, two juniors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm had called him an ant.</p>

  <p>How could Eddie tolerate all this?</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid of death?" Eddie said coldly.</p>

  <p>The man and woman sneered, and then the woman said, "You, an ant in Sky Northern Region, want to kill me? I don't think you can!"</p>

  <p>As other warriors heard her words, their expressions darkened. These two people from the divine kingdom weren't easy to deal with. Moreover, they weren't targeting only Eddie, but all of the warriors in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>But one of them was at the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and the other was at the middle level. Why were they so haughty?</p>

  <p>Both looked very young, and their skeletal ages probably weren't too old.</p>

  <p>They were highly talented, but in terms of strength, they were probably not a match for any of the fourth-grade sects present.</p>

  <p>As the woman finished talking, several warriors dressed in black appeared beside them. They had surprisingly reached the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and said, "No wonder they're so confident. It turns out they've got a bunch of warriors at the Life and Death Realm to protect them!"</p>

  <p>The black-clothed warriors didn't say a word once they had appeared. It looked like the man and woman were to lead this force.</p>

  <p>Those warriors were scaring Eddie too.</p>

  <p>The members of the eight forces stood on the platforms surrounding the abyss. They all looked at the last area, which was still empty.</p>

  <p>None of them knew that the last area belonged to the Yan family of Iron Salt City. But sadly, the corpses had eliminated the entire Yan Clan.</p>

  <p>Everyone present was guessing, looking around, or discussing through their life vitality, wondering what would happen next.</p>

  <p>No one could understand why the celestial tomb was designed this way.</p>

  <p>What was that Immortal Mist trying to do?</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was trying to figure things out, a ball of light appeared in the middle of the abyss. The light was like a drop of water that kept twisting and turning, and in the end, became a square. After the square stabilized, milky white and red spots appeared where it had been.</p>

  <p>At last, the light turned into a dice, a very common six-sided dice that was used in gambling dens.</p>
