  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon after Zheng killed the Man-eating Demon Flower, the sand storm that had been raging around the area of about a hundred miles instantly vanished.</p>

  <p>But as Zheng gazed into the distance, he could see the billowing sand storm a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>"It looks like the Mist Summoning Spirit is not alone in this desert. I am sure there are others like it all over this place, even though the effect of each can only cover a hundred miles. If I continue to move forward, I'm afraid I'll fall into the space illusion of another Mist Summoning Spirit."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Zheng's gaze fell on the elongated flute lying on the ground. He reached out his hand to grasp it. The flute revolved once before landing in his hand. "What kind of flute is this? I am definitely sure that she was lying about it. However, this flute can break the magic array set up by the Mist Summoning Spirit. It must be a tool that the people of the Sand Country use to cheat the True Gods. This might be helpful to get me out of this desert."</p>

  <p>Just as he finished saying his thoughts aloud, he heard No. 9527's voice.</p>

  <p>"Your guess is one hundred percent correct. Haha! Looks like you can't be trapped easily."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at No. 9527's words. "All this while you were aware about it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. The actual name of the Mist Summoning Spirit is Man-eating Demon Flower. It's just a kind of demon plant in its nature. But I have to admit that its space illusion is quite unique," No. 9527 said.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Zheng demanded.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 grinned and answered, "I wanted you to personally experience the malice of the Source World. This is far different from the divine land. The Source World's environment is much worse. You can expect such danger everywhere."</p>

  <p>After a long while, Zheng rolled his eyes and spat out, "Damn!"</p>

  <p>But No. 9527 was right on one point. The divine land was built by Chiyou for the Nine Li race, so the forbidden lands were bound to be the most dangerous places. Outside the forbidden lands, however, there wasn't much of a threat because there were almost zero fierce monsters.</p>

  <p>The Source World was much more dangerous than the divine land. There was no forbidden lands here, but nevertheless, it was hazardous.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was led around by the people of the Sand Country, he had a rough understanding of the Sweltering Desert through their conversation.</p>

  <p>Even though not all Maggie's words were entirely true, he could tell that he was heading in the right direction.</p>

  <p>After confirming the direction, Zheng flew towards the north with the flute.</p>

  <p>After a short while, he came across the sand storm again.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the sand storm, he realized that he was once again trapped in the space illusion. It must be another Man-eating Demon Flower's doing.</p>

  <p>Zheng placed the flute on his lips and gently began playing the notes. With the melodious sound of the flute, the yellow sand that was rolling towards him immediately dispersed on both sides.</p>

  <p>The long flute could easily break the magic array. Or it was safe to say that in order to let the people of Sand Country lure the prey for them, the Man-eating Demon Flowers would make way for whoever played the flute. This was an agreement between the people of Sand Country and the Man-eating Demon Flowers.</p>

  <p>Zheng could easily find the Man-eating Demon Flower in this space illusion and crushed it with his hands. But there were too many Man-eating Demon Flowers in the Sweltering Desert, and time was not his friend to kill them all.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to play the flute as he flew by. Suddenly, his gaze landed upon a woman in black, lying on top of a dune.</p>

  <p>As he approached her, he could see that the woman's leg was injured.</p>

  <p>The woman also felt Zheng's presence, as she looked up with a pair of beautiful eyes. Her mouth moved slightly. She was just in the process of asking for help when she saw the flute in his hand. Her expression instantly changed.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the woman with a sneer. The thunder internal momentum in his hand condensed, as a ray of lightning took shape.</p>

  <p>When the woman saw this, her face turned deathly pale. She immediately climbed up from the dune and ran away.</p>

  <p>The woman was obviously from the Sand Country. Lying on the dune, she had every intention to capture the True Gods who got lost in the desert. As soon as she sighted the flute, she must have realized that her game was up.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not waste time chasing after the woman. He continued to play the flute and flew forward.</p>

  <p>Along the way to the north, Zheng encountered more than a dozen such people of the Sand Country. All had similar tricks up their sleeves. Some of them pretended to be a group of refugees, while some were beautiful women all by themselves. Their beauty was truly mesmerizing to trap their clueless prey.</p>

  <p>After eight hours of continuous flight in the sand storm, Zheng finally saw a green hue standing out in the yellow desert. A few green shrubs dotted the desert like pretty little stars.</p>

  <p>As he continued to go north, he saw more and more green shrubs. After passing a clear river, he finally left the Sweltering Desert. On the other side of the river was a brown land, and in the distance, there loomed a massive city.</p>

  <p>"That should be the Excellence City that Emily had mentioned earlier," Zheng muttered as he looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't enter the city at once. Instead, he found a secret spot and set up a magic array. Then he sat cross legged, turned into an avatar and entered his inner world.</p>

  <p>He had promised the Evil God that he would let him out as soon as he entered the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, after entering the Source World, he got trapped in the desert. It did not seem right to leave the Evil God there.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had been restless in the past few days. He was afraid that Zheng might forget his promise.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God reached the consummation of True God Realm, he had to practice the Ways-blending Energy again. That was because the internal momentum that he had previously merged was not on consummate level.</p>

  <p>The sequence of the Godly Ways to be merged remained the same, and his speed was also not slow. But there continued to occur many explosions along the way. It could be because he was anxious to leave the world as soon as possible. Or perhaps he caused the troubles deliberately.</p>

  <p>At one time, the Ways-blending Energy at the consummation level exploded with great power. The barren land was blasted into pieces. Good thing was, the land was not inhabited.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng appeared in front of him, his eyes lit up with hope. He stood up, as he stared at Zheng and asked eagerly, "Can... Can I leave now?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Evil God's restless and eager face and smiled faintly. "If I don't let you out now, I'm afraid you'll ruin my inner world."</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to say goodbye to your wife?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No need for that," said the Evil God, shaking his head affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, relax yourself," Zheng said as he pushed the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God felt an invisible force grab him, and by that force, he felt himself rising above.</p>

  <p>He flew across the blue sky, white clouds and nine stars and then into the depths of the world.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he felt the sky and the earth spinning. Then he fell to the ground, to be greeted by a brand new world.</p>
