<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe was a legendary figure in the Sword Light Palace, even in the entire Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star Province was originally called the Evil-Mantis Province and previously occupied by the Evil Mantis race.</p>

  <p>Very few humans lived in the area. In the past, these humans hadn't been civilized and had existed in tribes.</p>

  <p>At that time, the human race was at the absolute bottom of the society, and their daily life was a struggle for survival. There existed a constant threat of being killed by the Evil Mantises, who were too cruel and powerful that ordinary divine citizens couldn't defeat them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Qiu Yinhe's appearance in the province had changed the situation.</p>

  <p>He had killed Jonas, the most powerful Evil Mantis in the Seven-Star Province who had haunted the province for millions of years and whose viciousness was known far and wide.</p>

  <p>All citizens of the Seven-Star Province well knew about Qiu Yinhe's legends, and so did the people in the Gracious Province. However, most people never saw him personally.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the disciples, the heads of the palaces, the officiant, and Laura were all astounded when they heard Qiu Yinhe speak.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is so extraordinary that he even drew Master Qiu Yinhe's attention,"</p>

  <p>Ingram murmured with an awestruck gasp.</p>

  <p>Everyone could hardly contain their excitement. Only Luo Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>He didn't know exactly how powerful Qiu Yinhe was, but he had previously encountered Fuxi and Chiyou in the past. No matter how powerful Qiu Yinhe was, he couldn't possibly be above those people.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the officiant, Qiu Yinhe said to Luo Zheng, "Young disciple, please come forward."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked once and stayed rooted to his spot.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the officiant anxiously said, "Luo Zheng, Master Qiu Yinhe asked you to approach him."</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Zheng replied flatly.</p>

  <p>He lightly stepped on the ground, and a gentle wind wrapped around him and carried him forward toward the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>As he approached the Lofty Sword, countless lines emerged on its surface and spread over the whole sword. At the same time, a circular arched door appeared at the center of the sword.</p>

  <p>The officiant was stunned when he saw the arched door.</p>

  <p>He was selected from all members of the Sword Light Palace and tasked with the honorable duty to control the Lofty Sword. Therefore, he held a very high position of authority in the Sword Light Palace and knew the Lofty Sword the best. However, he did not know that an arched door lay hidden inside the Lofty Sword... until now.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng approached the entrance of the arched door, he paused for a moment and flashed a helpless smile before finally stepping inside the door.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng didn't expect these things to happen.</p>

  <p>He hadn't intended to enter the Sword Light Palace in the first place. When the opportunity arrived, he grabbed it. After all, gaining mastery of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent would be to his benefit.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent would be so suitable for him. He did not feel any pressure during the entire cultivation process, and he mastered the complete Truth of Divine Dao all at once.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng understood that this was not a bad thing, he could not help but feel some hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword was hollow inside. Luo Zheng passed through a considerably large archway before entering an empty room.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated in the middle of the space, and the door behind him disappeared all of a sudden. Then, he heard Qiu Yinhe's voice asking, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around and replied calmly, "My name is  Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>"Your surname is Luo?" Surprise was evident in Qiu Yinhe's voice.</p>

  <p>After Qiu Yinhe liberated the Seven-Star Province, he had endowed its human inhabitants two surnames: Qiu and Yuebai. He originally thought that Luo Zheng must be a disciple hailing from the Qiu Clan or the Yuebai Clan, so he was taken aback by Luo Zheng's surname, Luo. He asked again, "Your surname is very rare. Are you an outlander of the Seven-Star Province?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng inwardly sighed. 'Not this again.' Everyone prying into his background had become a big headache for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saluted with cupped hands as he answered, "I was not born in the Seven-Star Province. I came to the province from the Gracious Province with Master Laura's recommendation."</p>

  <p>If Qiu Yinhe had continued to probe into his background, Luo Zheng would have had no other choice but to make up a story.</p>

  <p>The most important point of his journey in the Source World was to conceal all information regarding the divine land, which was the last hope and foundation of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Qiu Yinhe did not continue his line of questioning. He changed the subject and said, "Since you have joined the Sword Light Palace, I assume that you know the origins of the Sword Light Palace. Am I correct?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of a bit," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'm a Taiyi Governor of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. I created the Lofty Sword to build a path connected to the chaos. You have grasped the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent with Instant Enlightenment, which indicates an extraordinary talent in swordsmanship. The Taiyi Heaven Palace is an orthodox force of swordsmanship, and the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent is created by our leader, Eastern Emperor Taiyi. May I ask if you are willing to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace?" Qiu Yinhe unhurriedly said.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was famous in the Seven-Star Province, but it was only a small remote force in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword was undeniably powerful. However, what the other races feared was not the Lofty Sword itself, but the force behind it? the Taiyi Heaven Palace!</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe had established a set of standards for the selection of disciples from the Sword Light Palace. As dictated by these standards, the disciples were classified into eight grades according to their talents. The disciples whose talents reached the sixth grade could be recommended into the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Sword Light Palace had selected a large number of disciples with sixth-grade talent.</p>

  <p>Ingram was also a sixth-grade talent, but for some reason, he had never been able to enter the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>During the past century, however, the Sword Light Palace had witnessed a notable drop in the number of recommendations because not a single disciple with sixth-grade talent had been discovered. Luo Zheng's appearance finally put an end to this embarrassing situation.</p>

  <p>His Instant Enlightenment had already exceeded the standard set by Qiu Yinhe. It was extremely rare for a disciple to achieve this, even in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Qiu Yinhe did not expect that such an extraordinary talent would appear in this remote place.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why he invited Luo Zheng to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace and extended the invitation in person.</p>

  <p>"Just agree with him. The Taiyi Heaven Palace has much better conditions than this remote place. After all, it is one of the four orthodox forces of the human race..." No. 9527 stopped in the middle of its explanation. "No, I was mistaken. There are only three orthodox forces now. Moreover, Eastern Emperor Taiyi's strength is no less powerful than that of Xuanyuan."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking about? I already have a master," Luo Zheng spat out angrily as his face contorted into a scowl.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know what the three orthodox forces of the human race were, but he understood what No. 9527's words meant.</p>

  <p>He surmised that the Nine Li people would have been one of the orthodox forces of the human race if they hadn't been destroyed. As it were, only three orthodox forces were left.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe was very patient. He did not say anything else and just waited quietly for Luo Zheng's response.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had suggested that Luo Zheng should join the Sword Light Palace for a reason: for him to take advantage of their resources to improve himself quickly. However, entering the Sword Light Palace hadn't been his decision.</p>

  <p>He did it only because he couldn't travel through the provinces with his current strength.</p>

  <p>It was beyond their expectation for him to be able to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace through the Sword Light Palace, and it was indeed the best course of action for them for the time being.</p>

  <p>After weighing his options for several moments, Luo Zheng replied, "I am willing to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>"Good!" Qiu Yinhe said with a smile in his voice. "In that case, I would like to give you a gift."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, a cyan longsword with a faint light appeared in the space inside the Lofty Sword. The illusory weapon gave off an unusual aura.</p>

  <p>'It has the aura of an Other Shore Token, ' Luo Zheng realized. 'This sword must be an Other Shore Token!' At this realization, Luo Zheng was filled with elation, and his eyes narrowed in anticipation.</p>
