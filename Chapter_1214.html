<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was natural for any living being with a mind to desire improvement and betterment. Thus, all the races in the universe gave their all to expand and develop their forces.</p>

  <p>In order to improve their races in the fastest pace possible, they had to train their young talents just as vigorously.</p>

  <p>It was why every race had designed their own sets of rules to conduct a series of tests, which would evaluate the skills of the young members.</p>

  <p>Of course, each method of assessment differed greatly from each other.</p>

  <p>Aside from the observation of the Lotus Flowers, the testing methods from three races were considered the most accurate of them all: the Heavenly Path from the human race, the Ogre Abyss of the ogres, and the three magical towers of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Anyone who obtained any of the titles in the three magical towers would receive close protection by the Celestial Position race, and would be considered one of their core members. The same was also applied to those even of the lowest titles.</p>

  <p>Up until now, only less than a hundred thousand living members of the Celestial Position race had managed to possess a title. Eighty thousand of them held a bronze title.</p>

  <p>Eighteen thousand of them had a silver.</p>

  <p>Only one thousand managed to have a golden title.</p>

  <p>Among all of the members, only about sixty were given the Rakshasa or the Asura title.</p>

  <p>As for the Celestial Position title…</p>

  <p>Only six people were known to have it. They had all become absolute leaders of the Celestial Position race, and were considered legendary figures.</p>

  <p>That was why Dorothea felt taken aback by Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>She couldn't believe that this person in front of her had such an exceptional talent, as if Zheng had only existed in dreams.</p>

  <p>She had been previously delighted when she heard about the Tower of Crystal. They had come here to complete an important task of capturing the Ancestral Dragon and the Evil Dragon, and the information about the Tower of Crystal was an unexpected surprise. If they managed to bring back the Tower of Crystal to the Celestial Position race, it would definitely be recorded as a great contribution, even greater than the capture of the Ancestral Dragon and the Evil Dragon.</p>

  <p>However, all of that seemed insignificant now when they had discovered someone with a golden Celestial Position title.</p>

  <p>At that point, Dorothea wanted to stop the capture of the Evil and the Ancestral Dragons so that she could go to the Tower of Crystal and seek the truth. Once she had verified whether Zheng had really passed the test of the Talent Tablet and obtained the golden Celestial Position title, they would bring this man to the Celestial Position race as soon as they could.</p>

  <p>Dorothea could only imagine the shock on the faces of the Celestial Position's higher-ups if they brought this man in front of them.</p>

  <p>"You... You are not lying to me, right?" Dorothea asked in a trembling voice. She couldn't speak straight with all the adrenaline and excitement that flowed into her being.</p>

  <p>Dorothea had always been proud to be ranked at the first row of the Talent Tablet. But every time she met other members of the Celestial Position race with a title, she felt a bit frustrated that her talent was inferior to theirs.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, she also understood that talent was only an indicator of a warrior's abilities. Her arduous efforts and good luck still might make it possible for her to surpass those titled talents. Such instances weren't rare.</p>

  <p>Still, she didn't feel the same way towards the man in front of her. Their talents had such a huge gap between them, that she wouldn't even compare to him at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded as he looked at Dorothea with a smile and then said, "Yes, I'm not lying to you. But..."</p>

  <p>"But what?" Dorothea blinked nervously. She hoped that Zheng wouldn't say anything that would disappoint her.</p>

  <p>Zheng chuckled and said, "It looks like the Ancestral Dragon has hatched successfully."</p>

  <p>While they talked, the shell of the chained Ancestral Dragon egg had been completely broken. A soft nose nudged a shell piece away, and revealed a hairy body inside.</p>

  <p>The tiny creature looked less like a newborn baby dragon and more like a small seahorse instead. It had a long and thin head, and a pair of large eyes that glowed a bright cyan.</p>

  <p>After the tiny Ancestral Dragon came out from its eggshell, it swallowed the eggshell in one gulp, then started to look around in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Keep making up stories to trick that woman, and try to draw the Ancestral Dragon's attention to you. Once it stares at you first, it will recognize you as its family by imprinting," Brianna reminded Zheng in his mind.</p>

  <p>Then, Brianna heard Zheng explain to Dorothea about his golden title, which looked like it shocked her. Although Brianna had also heard about the towers of the Celestial Position race, she herself had never seen them, and couldn't understand what Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>Even then, Brianna admired how Zheng spoke. Of course, it wasn't because he had obtained a golden title or whatever it was— but she was impressed in how he got to trick this woman from the Celestial Position race like a fool. She believed that Zheng merely made up stories.</p>

  <p>'His boasting skills are truly not for show, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>After the small, furry creature had stared at Zheng for quite a while, Zheng finally smiled and told Dorothea that the Ancestral Dragon's egg had hatched.</p>

  <p>A soft purr was heard from the tiny dragon as it stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, it jumped and easily broke free from the refracted space, and proceeded to pounce towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>If this had happened a few moments prior, Dorothea would've been furious. They had painstakingly set up all sorts of devices in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land just to capture the Ancestral Dragon and the Evil Dragon. But now, Zheng had messed up their plan, and all their efforts were wasted.</p>

  <p>But after Dorothea had made sure that Zheng was most likely telling the truth, the Ancestral Dragon didn't seem that important anymore. She was surprisingly calm at this moment.</p>

  <p>If this man really possessed the golden Celestial Position title, then it wouldn't be surprising if the Ancestral Dragon acknowledged him at the right time. He undoubtedly had really good luck.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the little dragon purred and jumped into Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>It showed a close sense of intimacy towards him, and it kept nudging its furry head against his chest.</p>

  <p>It was known that an oviparous creature could move around completely on its own after it hatched out, and could also think independently to some extent. Thus, it was possible for such creatures to imprint. This meant that they automatically recognized the first living creature around them as their mothers.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, creatures like humans were completely ignorant upon birth. They needed a long period of training and learning before they could gradually establish their own awareness. Thus, such creatures did not have any imprinting behavior.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon might be the faith of the Genuine Dragon race, but it was also influenced by the imprinting.</p>

  <p>After it saw Zheng at first sight, a strong imprint had been formed in the little dragon's mind. And because of the imprint's effect, it recognized Zheng as its mother.</p>

  <p>The seven people of the Celestial Position race had actually prepared to prevent the imprinting behavior. They had originally planned to use the Time Law to hatch the Ancestral Dragon first, then seal it and bring it back to the Celestial Position race before any imprinting could happen.</p>

  <p>This matter was to be done by the higher-ups of their race.</p>

  <p>However, the Ancestral Dragon had hatched out faster than they had expected, and Zheng had accidentally run into this spire when Dorothea chased him, then he obtained the dragon's acknowledgement on Brianna's instructions.</p>

  <p>As he carried the small dragon with his hands, Zheng thought that Dorothea would attack him out of anger, so he thought about how to escape.</p>

  <p>But Dorothea didn't even move the slightest. She just stood there and blankly stared at him. She didn't even pay the least bit of attention to the small dragon in his arms.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with this woman?" Zheng was confused, so he asked Brianna's soul inside the body. She shook her head and said, "I don't know, either. Maybe she was taken aback by the amazing stories you've made up just now."</p>

  <p>"I didn't make up anything..." Zheng retorted. "Who knows?</p>

  <p>I don't believe a bit of it, anyway," Brianna sneered. She had witnessed Zheng's bragging skills before, so she didn't believe his words at all.</p>

  <p>"You should go with me!" Dorothea piped up from out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Go with you? Why?" Zheng was totally confused.</p>

  <p>"I won't pursue the Ancestral Dragon egg anymore. But, you have to obey me first!" Dorothea said seriously.</p>
