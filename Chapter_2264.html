<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's ranking had risen rapidly in the Hall of True Gods, drawing unprecedented attention to himself.</p>

  <p>But he himself didn't know this.</p>

  <p>After attaining ten consecutive wins, Luo Zheng finally decided to pause for a breath of some fresh air in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>The moment he opened the door, he saw that the entrance of the room was crowded with low-rank True Gods, who were waiting for him.</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods were taken by surprise as they didn't expect Luo Zheng to get out of his room this moment. They were in the midst of exchanging information on the anonymous man that they had mastered.</p>

  <p>Everybody whispered among themselves trying to guess the identity of the anonymous man. When the door opened, everyone immediately fell quiet at the same time. This scene was very strange.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at everyone and asked indifferently, "Are you all waiting for me? What's up?"</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods looked Luo Zheng up and down, trying to find some clues as to his identity. However, Luo Zheng did not have any specific features that would reveal the mystery. In order to maintain the enigma, he had specially turned his long robe into a light blue one.</p>

  <p>"I want to challenge you!" someone shouted boldly.</p>

  <p>After the first low-rank True God threw this challenge, all the others followed suit and started challenging Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Can I challenge you? There are 70 rankings between us."</p>

  <p>"Choose me!"</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, very few people were as popular as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They thought that if this anonymous man participated in the battles against low-rank True Gods, he was likely to be defeated. If someone won a duel with the anonymous man, they would also gain a great number of points from him.</p>

  <p>And even if they were defeated by the anonymous man, they would only lose a small amount of points, so it was a risk everyone was willing to take.</p>

  <p>"If you defeat me, I will give you another twenty divine might coins!" someone offered in an attempt to goad Luo Zheng into fighting him.</p>

  <p>Twenty divine might coins were not a big number for the low-rank True Gods on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>So more people started bribing him subsequently increasing the amount!</p>

  <p>"If you accept my challenge, I will give you eighty divine might coins. If you can defeat me..."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred divine might coins..."</p>

  <p>"Three hundred..."</p>

  <p>Soon it was like an auction: the True Gods in front of Luo Zheng began to raise their offers one after another.</p>

  <p>'I never expected that!' Luo Zheng thought to himself, flabbergasted, as he stared at this crazy group. Unexpected as it was, he still wanted to see how it would play out.</p>

  <p>However, according to the rules of the Hall of True Gods, only the ones who were a hundred ranks higher or lower than him were qualified to challenge Luo Zheng. The number of people in this category was only two hundred. Moreover, the warriors who ranked low in the current rankings were not top-level warriors on the Floating Islands, so they naturally weren't very rich.</p>

  <p>After a few rounds of bidding, the highest bidder turned out to be a big fat man, who promised Luo Zheng five hundred and fifty divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Earlier these people were so enthusiastic in challenging Luo Zheng because losing to him was not a big deal, but losing five hundred and fifty divine might coins was something an ordinary person could not afford.</p>

  <p>"Accept my challenge and I will give you five hundred and fifty divine might coins. What do you say?" the fatty said loudly and glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Deal!" Luo Zheng smiled. If he defeated the fatty, he could not only earn points but also earn a lot of divine might coins, so why not? It was a great deal!</p>

  <p>"My room number is 760, 008!"</p>

  <p>The fatty was very happy and he hurried towards his room.</p>

  <p>Losing more than five hundred divine might coins would indeed be very frustrating for the fat man, but in his eyes, it was a risk worth taking.</p>

  <p>His game plan, even if he lost, was that he would force Luo Zheng to use his trump card and thereby determine Zheng's origin.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng returned to his room, dozens of beams of light popped out from the wall. Actually these were the dozens of requests to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored those requests and accepted the challenge from the fat guy.</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>The scenery around him changed, and a new terrain appeared around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment was written all over Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Previously, the settings in the Arena of Legends were the same� a boundless plain with an incomparably clear starry sky. All the terrains had been exactly the same, without any change, from the time Luo Zheng had been fighting up until today.</p>

  <p>But this time it was different. His current environs were a world of ice and snow. Beneath his feet was a slippery layer of ice, and enormous fish were swimming under this layer. There were fist-sized snowflakes falling from the sky, with loud plops.</p>

  <p>"Why is the environment of this Arena of Legends different from the others?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>When the fat man heard Zheng's astonished voice, he laughed and said,</p>

  <p>"You don't even know this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and replied, "No, I really don't know."</p>

  <p>"The environment of the Arena of Legends can be changed as per one's wish, but you need to pay a certain amount of points," the fatty said proudly.</p>

  <p>"Change the environment..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around at the vast snow plain around him and said indifferently, "So this is not an illusion, but a world based in reality. It's a world that would benefit the True Gods who have cultivated the Ice Law or the Snow Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"You're right," said the fatty with a grin. He raised his big belly and several icy marks congealed on it slowly. Soon the icy marks covered his fat body until he was wearing a piece of icy armor.</p>

  <p>"So you have cultivated the Snow Godly Way." Luo Zheng wasn't interested in the fatty's theurgy. His Infinity Ruler had already absorbed the Snow Godly Way. "But this is unfair. Since the Arena of Legends is a place for the True Gods to compete with each other, it should be as fair as a battle ring. If the environment of the Arena of Legends can be changed with points, then everyone can choose an optimal environment for themselves, right?"</p>

  <p>The fatty chuckled again at Zheng's complaints. He stretched out his round legs and stomped lightly on the ground; a frost whirlpool appeared on the ground, from which a long stick of six feet long appeared. The surface of the long stick was covered with snowflakes. He grabbed the long stick and continued, "If you think the Arena of Legends is just a battle ring, then you are wrong. The origin of the Arena of Legends is full of twists and turns, and the mysteries contained within it are far beyond your imagination. You can pursue anything you want here, except for fairness.</p>

  <p>Haha!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend what the fatty was saying.</p>

  <p>The fatty didn't care about Zheng's concerns any more. He waved the long stick in his hand and jumped up to pounce on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange fog appeared under Zheng's feet. The fog turned into snowflakes and quickly began unfurling. The temperature around him began to decrease rapidly, and his entire body became extremely slow.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the fatty was extremely agile. He arrived in front of Luo Zheng almost in an instant, and whacked him with the long stick on his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression did not change at all. He even did not block the attack.</p>

  <p>Instead, he simply reached out to grab the long stick.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Luo Zheng could suppress his opponent using just his brute force.</p>

  <p>As a result, he didn't need to think too much.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the fatty revealed a strange smile at this moment. When Luo Zheng grabbed the long stick, it felt cold in his hand. The stick was actually a bunch of snowflakes. Luo Zheng chopped with his backhand and cut the fatty in his face. The fatty turned into a bunch of snowflakes and scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I have already known that you possess extraordinary brute force. But if you think you can defeat me only using strength, you are too naive.</p>

  <p>Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>The strength and characteristics of the anonymous man had already spread among the low-rank True Gods. Many low-rank True Gods had studied Luo Zheng. The fatty was obviously well prepared.</p>

  <p>The fatty's voice rang out behind Luo Zheng. At the same time, a loud roar was heard. The fatty had excellent hiding skills. He disappeared all of a sudden and in the next moment, he was behind Zheng's back, attacking him.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Luo Zheng turned his body, turned around and kicked the man.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>With one kick, the fatty turned into a pile of snowflakes again. The snowflakes danced like thousands of silver bugs, painting a beautiful picture.</p>

  <p>"Wrong again!"</p>

  <p>The fatty chuckled and made another move. Once more, he appeared behind Luo Zheng. There were icy marks on the long white stick in his hand, and he suddenly brought it down on Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>However, the stick only left a light icy mark on Zheng's back, without causing substantial damage to him.</p>

  <p>After he attacked with this stick, he rolled like a ball to quickly distance himself from Luo Zheng. A hand, producing cold air, constantly stroked the top of the long stick, as if it was pouring something into it.</p>

  <p>He still wore a smug smile on his face, as if he was sure to win.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood there, his face as solemn as never before. The fatty had left a mark on his back just now, and he didn't know what it would do.</p>

  <p>Although the fatty used the Snow Godly Way, the Godly Ways were changeable and many people could use all kinds of theurgy beyond way.</p>

  <p>The scene in front of him was really strange.</p>
