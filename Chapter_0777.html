<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Ning Yudie had restarted her cultivation nine times and her cultivation base was constantly changing, it was difficult for anyone to gauge her strength.</p>

  <p>Many people believed that even if Ning Yudie recovered her power and returned to the Virtual Tribulation Realm, she was still only slightly stronger than Emanuel and Morphens. But now, it looked like she had become more than just a little stronger than them. She could even be a match for a warrior at the Life and Death Realm whenever she became a late-stage Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>After getting rid of the demon emperor corpse, Ning Yudie once again led the group forward.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the warriors on the other eight paths also continued to advance.</p>

  <p>Eddie and the six cloaked independent warriors of the Virtual Tribulation Realm almost crushed the corpses without a word.</p>

  <p>The martial practitioners of the Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect, and Mysterious Luna Hall had passed through this section of the road safely despite the attacks they had encountered.</p>

  <p>The fastest of these nine forces were the martial artists who had come from the divine kingdom. The woman in black and the man beside her didn't make a single move. The warrior behind them rushed forward, a golden bow at the ready, and shot arrow after arrow at the corpses.</p>

  <p>These five arrows seemed to have a life of their own, shooting towards the five corpses with a bloodlust that was almost indecent. The strange thing was that after ripping through the heads of the five corpses, the arrows didn't weaken; instead, they devoured the corpses' energy, becoming stronger, and each split into two.</p>

  <p>Five arrows turned into ten, shooting towards the other ten corpses. After absorbing the energy of the ten corpses, the ten arrows became twenty, and then forty, eighty, and then a hundred and sixty arrows!</p>

  <p>The arrows finished off the corpses in a few seconds. They then merged into one sharp arrow and shot towards the demon emperor that had appeared at last. The arrow went through the demon emperor almost instantly.</p>

  <p>If the many warriors in Central Region ever saw the power of this bow, they would be speechless and envious of it.</p>

  <p>According to the characteristics of this bow, if they were to engage in a war between sects, this bow was an indefatigable advantage. As one arrow would turn into two, two would turn into four, four would turn into eight, just one arrow would probably be able to kill millions of warriors!</p>

  <p>"I've heard a lot about Gong's Transformation Bow. Now I see that its reputation is indeed well-deserved," another Life and Death Realm guard said, impressed by the skills of the warrior whose family name was Gong.</p>

  <p>The martial artist who was wielding the bow smiled, and then put the bow away.</p>

  <p>The woman in black and man beside her acted as if they hadn't seen what had happened and didn't care about the conversation between the two Life and Death Realm experts. Their expressions didn't change, as if this was how it should be.</p>

  <p>The two of them passed by the corpses piling up on the ground as they walked forward.</p>

  <p>The most unfortunate was the Yan Clan, a third-grade clan from Iron Salt City. It was considered a big family in the Central Region. The patriarch, Kirby Yan, was in the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. But other than him, the rest of the Yan family were unfortunately still in the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>The Yan Clan had been working hard on becoming a fourth-grade clan. The enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb was a secret treasure that had passed down from their ancestors, and the Yan Clan had been waiting for this day for hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>When their cultivation bases had been suppressed in the Mist Celestial Tomb, everyone except Kirby Yan, who had the power to protect himself, had had no power to fight against the corpses and thus were all torn to pieces. Only Kirby Yan survived.</p>

  <p>Kirby Yan was on the verge of going crazy, but he was alone and powerless, and couldn't reverse the situation. To top it all, the last demon emperor corpse had appeared. So Kirby Yan had no choice but to retreat into the tunnel.</p>

  <p>If the Yan Clan did not have a Virtual Tribulation Realm expert like him, they would be divided up by the other clans and powers within minutes, so he could not die.</p>

  <p>But when Kirby Yan walked back along the tunnel, he heard a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"The ones that have entered this celestial tomb must not go back."</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" Kirby Yan asked, panicking at the voice. He couldn't help but run at full speed, eager to get away from it.</p>

  <p>"Only through death can you have longevity..." the voice kept mumbling. Kirby Yan's panic was getting out of control.</p>

  <p>Even though the tunnel was long, as a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, he was able to pass quickly through it.</p>

  <p>'The entrance is right in front of me! I can feel it!'</p>

  <p>Kirby Yan thought. As long as he escaped the tunnel and entered the spatial passageway, he would be able to return to Iron Salt City.</p>

  <p>However, when he arrived at the entrance of the tunnel, he discovered that there was a tombstone blocking the way.</p>

  <p>A few words were neatly carved on the tombstone. They weren't difficult to read, but Kirby Yan wasn't in the head space to identify them right now.</p>

  <p>As he ran, the life vitality in his body shone like a ray of light.</p>

  <p>"Want to block my way with a tombstone? Break! Burning Sky Fist!" he shouted as he punched the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The tombstone seemed to be made of ordinary limestone, which even a Bone Refining level martial artist would be able to shatter with a single punch. But this tombstone remained intact even after Kirby Yan's punch, standing firmly before him.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Kirby Yan was at his wits' end, unable to shatter it. He struck desperately at the tombstone over and over again.</p>

  <p>The words on it glowed a little each time Kirby Yan's fist struck it.</p>

  <p>Only then did Kirby Yan notice the words written on it, "The ones that have entered this celestial tomb must not go back. Only through death can you have longevity!" Next to the words was a signature: Mist.</p>

  <p>The word weighed down on Kirby Yan with the weight of a mountain. He felt his vision darken as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>He heard another "heh heh" and turned around only to find that a large group of corpses led by the demon emperor corpse had followed him into the tunnel. They were now blocking the path behind him.</p>

  <p>Kirby Yan leaned on the tombstone, his eyes filling with despair. He was extremely remorseful. Why would a third-grade clan like his want to join those fourth-grade and fifth-grade sects to come here?</p>

  <p>As a warrior, he had to consider his own strength and abilities. If he wanted to compete with the top powers in the Central Region, he would be courting death.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed Ning Yudie, slowly making his way through the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Ever since they had killed those corpses, they hadn't encountered any danger.</p>

  <p>The space inside the celestial tomb was unimaginably vast. After the group had walked for about ten minutes, they suddenly heard Emanuel shout in surprise, "Herbal garden!"</p>

  <p>Everyone followed Emanuel's gaze and sure enough, there was a big herbal garden.</p>

  <p>No one had visited this celestial tomb ever since it had been built. If the herbal garden had immortal herbs planted in it, then their value would be immeasurable after thousands of years of growth!</p>

  <p>Yudie's face revealed the joy she felt. It would be so great if she could find the Flower of Life and Death in this herbal garden. To her and her master, the Flower of Life and Death was exceptionally important.</p>

  <p>The people from Cloud Hall rushed towards the garden, while Luo Luo Zheng followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the herbal garden, there was a single word etched into the ground: gift.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyelids twitched as he saw the word. What did this mean? Etiquette?</p>

  <p>A gift?</p>

  <p>The Mist Celestial Tomb was really strange. It was said to be a dangerous place, but so far the corpses hadn't been so dangerous. Even an ordinary fourth-grade sect could enter it. Besides, who would build their tomb like this? Not to mention, let a bunch of corpses guard it.</p>

  <p>However, the elders of Cloud Hall wouldn't consider all this.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I'm overthinking it, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he walked into the herbal garden. The moment he stepped into it, all sorts of strange and wonderful fragrances wafted towards him.</p>

  <p>"How fragrant!" he muttered, looking around. This garden was home to all sorts of strange flowers and herbs. Perhaps because no one had taken care of them for thousands of years, the garden had become messy.</p>

  <p>"This is Dragon's Smile," an elder exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Dreamland Flower. It's really Dreamland Flower!" another elder laughed delightedly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie was flying past those strange flowers and plants, but her face was gradually clouded in disappointment. She couldn't find the legendary Flower of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>Although these medicinal herbs were expensive, they could only be used as raw material for fifth or sixth-grade medicinal pills. They might not even catch Yudie's attention.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng picked a few herbs, but they were all herbs that could stabilize his cultivation. At this, the cyan dragon said, "Luo Luo Zheng, the herbs in this garden are all very common, but there is one thing that's very precious."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked doubtfully. "Aren't the herbs supposed to be the most precious in a herbal garden?"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon chuckled and said, "In the center of the garden is a handful of brown soil. It's valuable. Take it with you."</p>

  <p>"A handful of soil?" Luo Luo Zheng said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It isn't ordinary soil, but Swelling Earth," the cyan dragon said nonchalantly.</p>
