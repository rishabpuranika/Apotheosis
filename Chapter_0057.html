<br/><br/>

  

  <p>At that time, the masters were waiting outside Bloody Mountain. They had all locked onto Ryan through their picture slabs.</p>

  <p>Ryan had shown the most potential in the blooded test, but most masters had lost interest in him. While it was true that the masters used the test to hunt for potential disciples, they had their reasons for not focusing on Ryan.</p>

  <p>Firstly, although Ryan was the strongest candidate in this blooded test, the masters believed that he would want to join Dragon Peak because his relative, Master Fang, was the head of Dragon Peak. If Ryan had no intention of considering other peaks, then the masters would not waste their time trying to recruit him as a disciple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was another reason that drove the masters' attention away from Ryan. The masters had been watching the examinees who had entered the second and third layers of the blooded test. They had seen Luo Zheng on their picture slabs, and his abilities had caught their attention. They had been watching Nory for a long time since Luo Zheng had saved him. Although disciples from noble clans had surrounded Luo Zheng, he still risked himself to save Nory. Since Luo Zheng and Nory seemed to be friends, the masters thought they would stay together.</p>

  <p>However, to their great disappointment, they failed to find Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng didn't seek out Nory in the next layer.</p>

  <p>The masters assumed that Luo Zheng might like fighting alone and dislike having contact with others. Perhaps Luo Zheng was a man who preferred coming and going freely.</p>

  <p>After a long while, when no master had been able to find Luo Zheng on their picture slabs, one master switched to Ryan. That was when he noticed the fight beginning between Ryan and Luo Zheng. Once he had alerted the other masters, excitement surged through them. They all shifted their picture slabs to Ryan right away.</p>

  <p>Given the potential of both Ryan and Luo Zheng, the masters knew that a great fight lay ahead. Adding to the excitement were the odds that were now in Ryan's favor since he had cast a large net entrapping himself and Luo Zheng inside.</p>

  <p>Ryan had been the most promising candidate during the test. But Luo Zheng was an unexpected successful entrant. Ryan's choice for which peak he would join was obvious and settled, however, Luo Zheng was different since he came from a low-level clan. He had no one to depend on. Since he was a person of extraordinary ability, all the masters intended to secure him as their disciple and cultivate him with all their strength to create a bright future for their peaks.</p>

  <p>Seeing the battle between Ryan and Luo Zheng, the interest of all masters was aroused.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think will win?" One master whispered to the master next to him.</p>

  <p>"I think Ryan will win!" The master answered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Look at the weapon in Ryan's hand. Don't you know that dagger? It's called the Cut-All-Like-Air Dagger! The energy filaments emitted by this spiritual weapon were capable of destroying anything, no matter how strong. Luo Zheng would be knocked out of the blooded test as soon as the energy filaments cut him."</p>

  <p>Before long, all the masters were debating about the odds of the fight between Ryan and Luo Zheng. Some supported Ryan, while some thought Luo Zheng would win. They could not reach a consensus.</p>

  <p>Only one master remained silent. Master Su was very upset. She sulked like a little girl who had hidden a toy of great interest to her from others but had lost it before she found the chance to take it home on the sly.</p>

  <p>Her expression conveyed her disappointment and anxiety.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at Ryan who was standing across from him. He gathered his strength and enveloped his body in an eerie iridescent purple light.</p>

  <p>At this time, Ryan was one of the strongest enemies he had ever encountered. Luo Zheng knew that this was just the beginning. He would face many enemies on his path, and they would be stronger than Ryan.</p>

  <p>Although Ryan was at the marrow refining level, he put great pressure on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While many children idled away their time, many children from noble clans cultivated hard and possessed incredibly powerful strength.</p>

  <p>They had access to the best resources in the world. If they could cultivate hard, they would make rapid progress and gain higher combat effectiveness than cultivators from ordinary families at the same level.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng circled Ryan. After circling Ryan twice, neither Luo Zheng nor Ryan had attacked. Ryan started his attack on Luo Zheng when Luo Zheng circled him for the third time.</p>

  <p>With a malicious smile on his face, Ryan pulled a bright blue filament from the dagger in his hand and then threw the filament at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under normal conditions, Ryan looked gentle and quiet. However, he was in a frenzied state when he was fighting with others. It seemed that mutilating his opponent was the only way to calm Ryan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped up without hesitation and rolled back to avoid the bright blue filament, but he was a little slow. The bright blue filament flew past his forehead and cut off some of his hair.</p>

  <p>This narrow escape shocked Luo Zheng. He felt ashamed at not being able to dodge the attack completely. Luo Zheng gulped when he realized that had he been any slower, the filament would have sliced his head off.</p>

  <p>Ryan gave Luo Zheng no time to catch his breath. He rotated the dagger in his hand and generated many chaotic bright blue filaments in a minute. Then he ran toward Luo Zheng with the intention of slamming Luo Zheng with the bright filaments.</p>

  <p>The treacherous filaments would cut Luo Zheng into pieces, and he would die a tragic death if Ryan were to succeed.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Zheng had no other choice but to run!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not attack Ryan when the filaments surrounded him.</p>

  <p>Running straight at the person holding the filaments would increase Zheng's odds of being shredded. Luo Zheng needed another plan.</p>

  <p>The day had not turned out the way Luo Zheng had expected. The test had been going well. After all, Luo Zheng had enough crystal shards to pass the blooded test. But now when he was so close to success, he did not expect anything like this to happen. What could he do? With no other alternatives, Luo Zheng smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>The large net covered Ryan and Luo Zheng. The net encompassed hundreds of feet, but there was little space for Luo Zheng to dodge.</p>

  <p>Since Ryan was relentless in his attacks, Luo Zheng had no choice but to retreat several steps. At last, Luo Zheng was cornered. There was nowhere left for him to go.</p>
