<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 925 The Maze (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Due to the unexpected appearance of the fog, the two sides temporarily stopped fighting and decided to escape the invasive fog first. However, they still remained a considerable distance with each other, making sure they were completely aware of the movements of their opponents.</p>

  <p>After all, they were enemies, not friends.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, Malcom had chased them for about thirty miles persistently. However, he was certain of the fact that he had not been there for long since he entered the region surrounded by the fog, as he estimated he only traveled for about four or five miles in total.</p>

  <p>Judging by the flying speed of this particular group of warriors, they fathomed that they should be able to return in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts were seemingly troubled as they all visibly sported identical looks of apprehension--no one was certain enough to quell their doubts about whether or not they could even walk out of the fog.</p>

  <p>Five more minutes had passed by, yet they still found themselves still stuck in the thick fog. Glancing at one another with uneasiness, they knew that with their current flying speed, they should have flown dozens of miles in that short period of time. In spite of this, the fog still appeared to have no end in sight even if they felt they were closer and closer to way out. With furrowed eyebrows, they were slightly panicking at the fact that they could not even see any sign that indicated the edge of the hazy fog.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! We're done for. It's just like the rumors have said! Once we enter the fog, there will be no turning back?" a worried expression was painted across Shane's features as he morosely uttered.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," Malcom berated. Although he still had the grit to maintain a false sense of calm on the surface, he could not deny the truth that he was a little alarmed and anxious by the way things were going. As a matter of fact, the ogre race was the race who happened to be the most familiar with the Dark Nether Cave. Previously, several races had joined hands to explore and discover what lay beneath the core area of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the number of warriors that the ogre race had specifically sent out was more than that of the others. As not a single soul had returned, the ogre race suffered the most loss out of any of the races.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, the ogres were the ones who had unfalteringly prepared themselves to the best of their abilities during the exploration of the core last time. It was to the extent that every ogre warrior had made a life token, as well as established a message rune system for communication.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, things immediately went wrong after the warriors entered the dense fog, due to the fact that all of the message runes they created were all suddenly disconnected and they were then unable to communicate with the outside world. However, strangely, their life tokens were all still intact.</p>

  <p>Since the life tokens were still intact, they were somehow relieved because it meant that they were still alive. Thus, the warriors outside had assumed that they were relatively safe after entering the fog from the start. However, after three days had passed, all the life tokens belonging to them had all shattered simultaneously! Without a doubt, over a dozen ogre top-level war lords all died in an instant!</p>

  <p>Astonished at what they had just discovered, they all wondered the same thing: just what was it that had caused the sudden death of these top-level war lords?</p>

  <p>Regrettably, they were all at a loss because it was a mystery that no one was able to solve.</p>

  <p>With a heavy heart, Malcom might have had the chance to solve this mystery, but he was afraid that the price in exchange for it would probably be his life.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this time, Malcom was indeed extremely agitated and nervous.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he still strove to appear as calm as he could, for the sake of the other warriors and for his own sake.</p>

  <p>At the present, Luo Luo Zheng, who was not far behind him, suddenly spoke up,</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the abrupt voice, they all whirled around to look at Luo Luo Zheng who appeared to have noticed something. "What happened?" Fabian asked, looking at the man curiously.</p>

  <p>"Look!" With his eyes trained below, Luo Luo Zheng pointed at the ground, where there seemed to be a small mark that was almost unnoticeable.</p>

  <p>In an instant, everyone looked down at the mark and asked at the same time, "Oh, what is that?"</p>

  <p>"Just before we set out, I secretly left this mark. Now..." Glancing between the mark and the others in front of him with a bothered frown on his face, he paused for a while as if deep in thought before speaking up once more,</p>

  <p>"We just went back to the place where we started off."</p>

  <p>Chuckling mirthlessly, Shane addressed Luo Luo Zheng a reply, "So it seems like we were going in circles?"</p>

  <p>Confirming his statement, Luo Luo Zheng gravely nodded and everyone's crestfallen faces gave the impression of hopelessness.</p>

  <p>"Why is this happening, then?" Fabian whined, waving his arms around petulantly. "We were obviously flying in a straight line!" the warrior complained, huffing at the impossibility of the situation.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Luo Luo Zheng moved closer to Fabian and promptly countered,</p>

  <p>"Are you sure we were flying in a straight line all this time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am quite sure!"</p>

  <p>Fabian firmly replied as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng crossly.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head as he exasperatedly sighed, Luo Luo Zheng tried to get his point across without sounding impertinent. "This fog is somewhat strange. But even if this was a common fog, it would not be that easy for us to keep moving forward in a straight line."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, are you perhaps, doubting our intelligence?"</p>

  <p>Shane asked, raising an eyebrow in challenge at the underlying implications of what Luo Luo Zheng had just said.</p>

  <p>All around him were a group of capable and top-level war lords. With a cautious glance between Luo Luo Zheng and Shane, they did wonder right then if the former had insinuated that a group of war lords were not clever enough to know if they were walking in a straight line or not. 'Did he really mean what he said?' they all collectively pondered. In fact, even a small kid could tell something that obvious so Luo Zheng's words were undoubtedly a bit confusing to understand.</p>

  <p>Sighing once again, Luo Luo Zheng gave Shane an indifferent look before walking closer to the offended man. Once he was at arm's length, Luo Luo Zheng reached his hand out and tore a piece of cloth from his sleeve. Nodding to the other direction, he said to Shane, "Come here."</p>

  <p>"What are you planning to do?"</p>

  <p>The man cautiously stared at Luo Luo Zheng as he anticipated what he was about to do next.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I only need you to help me conduct an experiment. I'm not going to fight with you," Luo Luo Zheng simply said, crossing his arms against his chest.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, Shane did not want to go with him, and it was written all over his face just by the way he doubtfully looked between Malcom and the rest of his companions. If Luo Luo Zheng were to suddenly attack him, with the watchful presence of several others by his side, how could he resist then?</p>

  <p>However, upon observing Luo Zheng's genuine gesture, Malcom seemed to have his mind made up as he promptly ordered, "Shane, go over to him."</p>

  <p>Seeing as he could not deliberately refuse Malcom's command, he had no choice but to brace himself and walk up to Luo Luo Zheng who was patiently waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Raising the strip of cloth in his hand right in front of the hesitant man, Luo Luo Zheng looked at Shane directly in his eyes before instructing him carefully, "Now, you don't need to fly. You don't have to use your life vitality or your other special senses. Just try to walk forward by instinct!"</p>
