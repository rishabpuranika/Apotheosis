  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King and the Monkey Masters were relatively simpleminded, so they were not good at strategizing.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had completely put his trust in Luo Zheng. In any case, Luo Zheng and the humans were against the Snake Spirit Sect, so he figured he could let them deal with everything.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't know the details, so he assumed Luo Zheng was submissive to the Monkey Spirit King, just like he was submissive to the Bird Masters.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when he had heard Luo Zheng's words, he was totally surprised.</p>

  <p>"Well, is it any use talking to you?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," replied Luo Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng wore a serious expression, the Grandmaster of Heaven still didn't believe him. He said, "Don't joke with me, boy."</p>

  <p>"I'm not kidding," Luo Zheng said gravely.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes shifted to the side of the hall, where two Monkey Masters stood guarding the door. The two Monkey Masters must have heard Luo Zheng's words, but they seemed unaffected by them.</p>

  <p>Helplessly, the Grandmaster of Heaven said, "Please step back."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the human heroes did as he said.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven spread out his hands, and two golden crosses appeared in his palms. When the crosses coincided, the coordinates appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A soft sound rang in everyone's ears, and a shadow of a huge bird materialized in front of them. It was the Bird Master, Lawler.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other Bird Masters, Lawler was just of medium build, yet his head almost touched the ceiling of the hall.</p>

  <p>Lowering his head slightly, he saw the group of humans standing before him. He bore a strange, ambiguous expression. "Grandmaster of Heaven, I came here in person to see the Monkey Spirit King. Why are these humans here?"</p>

  <p>"They said we could talk about this matter with them," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with an indifferent shrug.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Lawler raised his head arrogantly.</p>

  <p>In doing so, his head smashed open the ceiling of the hall. Then, he let out a long howl.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>The high pitched howl echoed all throughout the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, a huge and agile figure ran wildly along the lake. When he closed in on the hall, he leapt up high and kicked open the door to the hall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The huge vibration made everyone in the hall jump from shock.</p>

  <p>"I could hear you howl from afar, Lawler," said Manuel.</p>

  <p>Lawler stared at Manuel and sighed discontentedly, "I came to the Night View Island in person. Why are there a group of humans?"</p>

  <p>"Humans? What's wrong with humans?" Manuel asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Don't play dumb. Can the humans from the secondary world really represent you?" Lawler couldn't help but feel annoyed.</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits were born a bit dull. It was only then that Manuel understood what Lawler meant. He patted his forehead and laughed heartily. "Of course they can represent us. My king has fully authorized them. You can talk to them about the alliance."</p>

  <p>"What? They were authorized?"</p>

  <p>Lawler was stunned.</p>

  <p>'How stupid can the Monkey Spirit King be!' he cursed silently.</p>

  <p>He had known the monkeys were simple-minded, but he had no choice but to grit his teeth and bear it in silence. If he really scolded the Monkey Spirit King, he would be in trouble and wouldn't be able to form an alliance with them.</p>

  <p>"If you don't trust them, I can stay for the meeting," Manuel said. "But you have to talk to them."</p>

  <p>Manuel jumped high again, bounding towards a corner of the hall to squat.</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Lawler was rendered speechless once more.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the Great Ape King had come.</p>

  <p>And he had no choice but to ally himself with the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven who stood beside Lawler thought the same, but he was more agitated.</p>

  <p>After all, he had always been a bit jittery when faced by the Bird Masters, but he was even more restless now that Luo Zheng and his companions had unofficially become the leaders of the Monkey Spirit Sect. Even the legendary Great Ape King was obedient to them!</p>

  <p>Lawler retracted his head from the ceiling. Glancing at the group of people with a rather disdainful look, he said, "Now that the Snake Spirit Sect has become powerful on the Other Shore, they have begun to downgrade the chaos. If they succeed, all of us will perish. The Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect will be no exception."</p>

  <p>Lawler didn't intend to include the humans at first, but he thought about it for a while and added, "Humans will also die. So the only way for us to survive now is to form an alliance between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>The alliance would also be quite beneficial to the human race. All the human heroes, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, were very happy about it.</p>

  <p>Lawler thought that Luo Zheng would definitely agree without hesitation.</p>

  <p>But to his annoyance, Luo Zheng asked unhurriedly, "As far as I know, both the Bird Spirit Sect and the Nihility race want to destroy everything. Are you giving up on that now?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's expression darkened at once. 'How dare you! You could say that to me, but you're talking to Lawler now!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A murderous look appeared in Lawler's eyes. "That's our concern. It's none of your business."</p>

  <p>"It had nothing to do with me in the past, but now that we are going to form an alliance, I have to be clear about it," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Lawler was speechless. He had looked down upon these humans. Now as he heard Luo Zheng's words, he couldn't help but feel the rage surging within him. His face contorted in fury, and it took every ounce of his willpower to not strike him down on the spot.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, this was the territory of the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Great Ape King was still watching, and most importantly, he was here to form an alliance.</p>

  <p>In the end, Lawler willed his anger to simmer down. "We have to fulfill our king's wish, but on the premise that he's safe and sound."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that the Bird Spirit King is in danger now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lawler said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, the Snake Spirit King had almost killed the Bird Spirit King, but at the last moment, the Snake Spirit King had retreated. Lawler, Duran, Orval and other Bird Masters had yet to figure out why he had chosen to retreat instead.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do after we form an alliance?" Luo Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>Lawler replied, "We hope the Monkey Spirit Sect will help us to launch a counterattack against the Snake Spirit Sect. We have already come up with a good plan."</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit King that hadn't awakened yet was no match for the Snake Spirit King, but with the help of the invincible Monkey Spirit King, they were hoping to tip the scales in their favor.</p>

  <p>"I refuse," Luo Zheng replied bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Then go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The killing intent in Lawler's eyes boiled, and his wing slashed down on Luo Zheng's head like a four hundred-foot-long saber.</p>

  <p>His speed was so fast that even Manuel squatting nearby did not have the time to react.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The whole hall was smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was also shocked. Lawler had killed Luo Zheng instantly! Things were getting heated now.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Not far away, Manuel took a deep breath and blew the dust and rubble into the lake.</p>

  <p>As the dust cleared, the Grandmaster of Heaven gasped in shock at what he saw.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still standing, perfectly unharmed, with one hand stretched out, holding the tip of Lawler's wing with ease.</p>

  <p>Lawler was totally shocked. The Grandmaster of Heaven had mentioned this several times before, but it never fully registered on Lawler how strong this human was.</p>

  <p>But even so, how could he easily resist his attack?</p>

  <p></p>
