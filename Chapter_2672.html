<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2672 Judgment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, a space wave appeared as Murphy came out of the void.</p>

  <p>In the Time Sea, only Holy Beings were allowed to use the spatial transference freely.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Beings didn't like doing it very often. There must be something very important that Murphy had to come to the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>When the two guards of the Dongfang Clan saw Murphy approaching, they immediately went up to him and bowed.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for Holy Nicholas. I have something very important to discuss with him. You'd better hurry up and find him for me," said Murphy anxiously.</p>

  <p>The two guards looked at each other with embarrassment on their faces.</p>

  <p>One of them said, "Holy Nicholas is currently at the back hall. He told us not to disturb him no matter what happens."</p>

  <p>"The back hall! He has always been in the back hall! Only one thing is certain. He will be ruined by that woman sooner or later!" Anger was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' character had been getting stranger over the past years.</p>

  <p>Originally, under the leadership of the union of the wealthy clans above the Time Sea, they were supposed to take control of the Abyss Demon Region but that wasn't the case anymore.</p>

  <p>Each time the Holy Beings visited, Nicholas was either in the back hall or exploring the Time Sea to find the woman's body.</p>

  <p>According to how some Holy Beings like Murphy saw it, the union of the wealthy clans had gained an absolute advantage and taken full control of the situation.</p>

  <p>However, there were already three forbidden lands out of four that were being controlled by outsiders.</p>

  <p>The Everest Spirit Mountain was under the control of Mike's first disciple, while Bromley's second disciple had control over the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>As for the Soul Wilderness, Estelle saved Luo Zheng's life last time. It was safe to assume that she was on Mike's side.</p>

  <p>Although Mike was dead in some sense, his strategy was still far-reaching, which always put Murphy in a constant state of fear. He was afraid that there were always some big troubles waiting for him.</p>

  <p>The two guards were so afraid that they turned pale when they heard Murphy's words.</p>

  <p>"Holy Murphy, calm down."</p>

  <p>"We're sure that Holy Nicholas will come out soon."</p>

  <p>The two guards were afraid that Nicholas would be disturbed by Murphy.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas took out his anger on them, they would have to suffer a lot.</p>

  <p>However, Murphy completely ignored them.</p>

  <p>Seething in anger, he took a deep breath and said loudly, "Holy Nicholas, I have important matters to discuss with you. Would you please come out now?"</p>

  <p>His voice was so long and loud that it echoed through the halls.</p>

  <p>Inside the exquisite and luxurious back hall, a plate of orange sandalwood was slowly burning. A ray of purplish blue smoke rose and emitted a refreshing fragrance.</p>

  <p>The fragrance lingered in people's noses to appease their souls. It made them feel fresh, energized, and stable.</p>

  <p>The sandalwood was the famous Lofty Tree sandalwood from the North Sea. It was extracted from resins on the knots found at the top of the Lofty Tree. It was known to be an extremely precious treasure in the divine land and it had always been difficult to find even for the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Especially, in the current divine era, the Lofty Tree emitted a strong sense of death that turned the range of 33 million miles into a death land, making the Lofty Tree sandalwood even harder to find.</p>

  <p>Nicholas sat in the hall as he stared at the glazed box not far away.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since Lorena's last response.</p>

  <p>It was all his fault.</p>

  <p>He had been constantly exploring the Time Sea for the past few years but was still unable to locate her body.</p>

  <p>There were too many fragments in the Time Sea. All the moments from the past divine eras had become time fragments in the sea.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, it was very difficult for Nicholas.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he began to hear Murphy's loud voice coming from afar.</p>

  <p>The sound waves of his voice caused the wisp of the purplish blue smoke from the Lofty Tree sandalwood to shake.</p>

  <p>Nicholas frowned slightly as he disappeared from the hall in a flash.</p>

  <p>After he left, Lorena's head rose slowly from the glazed box as she opened her eyes slightly.</p>

  <p>A hint of emotion could be seen in her slightly sad yet beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>Although she had been asleep for the past few years, she still paid attention to even the slightest hint of movement.</p>

  <p>She knew that the voice she heard was from Murphy.</p>

  <p>What happened? Why was Murphy so anxious?</p>

  <p>Did Harold finally make a move?</p>

  <p>Or had Luo Zheng finally returned?</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Lorena's face the moment she thought of her son.</p>

  <p>At that time, kicking Luo Zheng out of the divine land was a risk she had to take. She knew it was the only choice left.</p>

  <p>The chaos was also filled with different booby traps.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was not afraid of the possible corrosion from the chaotic energy, his cultivation was still too weak. His chances of surviving were very slim.</p>

  <p>Return? She didn't think it was possible.</p>

  <p>Lorena let out a soft sigh of disappointment as she slowly sank into the brown solution.</p>

  <p>With a wave of space, Nicholas showed up right in front of Murphy. He asked with a smile on his face, "Murphy, what brings you here?"</p>

  <p>An angry expression appeared on Murphy's face as he said, "A powerful master has visited the divine land."</p>

  <p>"A powerful master? What are you talking about?" Hearing his words, Nicholas raised his eyebrows. "What kind of master? Are you talking about Bromley?"</p>

  <p>It was known that the Holy Beings rarely left the divine land. Bromley was the only one who constantly wandered outside.</p>

  <p>Bromley was on Mike's side.</p>

  <p>If Bromley had returned, Murphy should be more vigilant.</p>

  <p>"If Bromley was here, it would be a lot of fun." Murphy said with a gloomy face, "Someone created a space channel just outside the divine land. The construction of the space channel was quite complex. Even when I personally attacked it in the Murphy Universe, I was still unable to destroy it."</p>

  <p>"What? How could that be possible?"</p>

  <p>His words caused Nicholas to worry.</p>

  <p>In their own universes, the Holy Beings were omnipotent and would never fight others in their universes.</p>

  <p>If Murphy couldn't destroy the space channel in his own universe, then the creator must be very skilled.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas soon calmed down. He narrowed his eyes and said,</p>

  <p>"It's said that there is a space barrier just outside the divine land. Even if the outsiders create space channels, they will still be unable to enter. It's not easy to open the barrier in a short period of time."</p>

  <p>"But the Yellow Emperor Guards were able to come in," Murphy said.</p>

  <p>Nicholas released a faint smile as he continued, "It took them twenty years to open the space barrier."</p>

  <p>"That means we only have 20 years left." Murphy raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Twenty years was just a mere snap of their fingers when it came to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The crisis was imminent. How could they possibly know how powerful the intruder was?</p>

  <p>"Apart from that, the space channel has been created to pierce its way to the divine land. It's more likely that someone has been sent here. In order to avoid being discovered by me, they divided the space channel into thirteen paths and scattered them in thirteen regions," Murphy muttered.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen paths," said Nicholas with a pensive look on his face. "Who could they have possibly sent here? We can also assume that this intruder is someone from the divine land."</p>

  <p>    </p>
