</p>

  <p>Staring at the Shadow Bearing Sword in Zheng's hand, Harper went on,</p>

  <p>"You seem to have cultivated more than ninety percent of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, and you have a good understanding of martial arts.</p>

  <p>However, the sword has been with me for many years, and it already has the spirituality. If you want to wield it, you must be well-versed with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about the long sword in Zheng's hand except for its weight. It looked like an ordinary long sword.</p>

  <p>It must be driven by the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>He bowed to Harper and said, "I hope you will give me some advice."</p>

  <p>"It's not a big deal. The comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way depends on one's own abilities. You can only get as much of it based on your own understanding. The pursuit of the Truth of Cultivation Nature is natural. It could cooperate with almost any cultivation method, but the Truth of Goodwill and Malice is different,"</p>

  <p>Harper said as he tapped his finger in the air.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the scenery around the deep well began to change.</p>

  <p>The streaks of time quickly intertwined on the wall of the well, leaving dense characters on it.</p>

  <p>The words that appeared on the wall were, "You have a malice, then all the people in the world will be your enemy. You have a goodwill, then you will benefit the whole world."</p>

  <p>"Is this the mind method of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>When he was reading the words quietly in his mind, an indescribable feeling of discomfort arose in his heart.</p>

  <p>The words needed to be fully comprehended before he could absorb them bit by bit.</p>

  <p>'However...' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>'Since Harper and Mother are from the Source World, they should be considered extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>Can't an extraordinary creature use Sanskrit words directly?'</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In no time, the words on the well wall flew down and gathered in front of Zheng, forming a small scroll.</p>

  <p>Zheng picked up the scroll, and asked, "Master Harper, there's one more thing that I'm not sure of. Are you using the same language as ours?</p>

  <p>Don't the extraordinary creatures use Sanskrit?"</p>

  <p>Every race had its own distinctive words and language.</p>

  <p>The language and words of each race, much like the Demon Night race and other races, were different.</p>

  <p>But the most essential culture was the human language and words.</p>

  <p>Zheng believed that these languages and words were transmitted from the divine land to the universe. When Mike built the Evolutionary Universe, he had transferred these cultures to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>For example, Zheng had built his own inner world, so the languages and customs, and the languages that the Evil God and the others used were the same as that of the humans in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng's question made Harper chuckle. "Sanskrit is not that easy to decipher even for us. Your mother knows that too."</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded, adding, "Yes. The language we are using was created by a man called Cang Jie in the Source World. It is being used widely. The Nine Li people have been living with these words, which have been transferred to the divine land. The words you have learned in the Evolutionary Universe have also been inherited from the Source World."</p>

  <p>"I see." A look of surprise appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He had always believed that the words they used commonly were from the divine land, but he never imagined that they might be inherited from the Source World.</p>

  <p>"As for Sanskrit, that is derived from the words of the Chaos Ancient God," explained Lorena.</p>

  <p>"That's weird! Is it difficult to decipher it even in the Source World?</p>

  <p>How could Geoffrey read Sanskrit so easily?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"What?" Harper's eyebrows suddenly shot up.</p>

  <p>"Who is this Geoffrey? He can read Sanskrit? Seriously?" Lorena was so astonished by these facts that she was babbling now.</p>

  <p>"Mother, Geoffrey is your grandson," Zheng announced.</p>

  <p>"My grandson?"</p>

  <p>Lorena was beaming with pride. She didn't expect to hear that she had a grandson.</p>

  <p>Harper asked anxiously, "Zheng, did you say Geoffrey could easily understand Sanskrit?"</p>

  <p>Harper stressed the word "easily".</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, feeling a bit confused at his question.</p>

  <p>Harper suddenly raised his hand, and a bright, golden word flashed in his palm, which was a Sanskrit word with a unique shape. "Do the Sanskrit words look like this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's correct," Zheng nodded. "Geoffrey deciphered the Truth of Cultivation Nature from the Sanskrit words, otherwise, I couldn't have mastered the Truth of Cultivation Nature to such a high level."</p>

  <p>Zheng himself had also been curious about Geoffrey's rare talent.</p>

  <p>Harper and Lorena looked at each other, their eyes full of concern.</p>

  <p>"The words of the Chaos Ancient God can't be deciphered by ordinary people even in the Source World," said Lorena in a somber tone. "Only those who have the Ancient God Eyes have the ability to decipher Sanskrit. And those who have the Ancient God Eyes in the Source World are extremely rare."</p>

  <p>"So does that mean Geoffrey has the Ancient God Eyes?" Zheng blinked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Yan, who was standing beside them, smiled proudly and said, "Wow brother! Looks like my nephew is very powerful. I really must see him this time when we leave the debate venue."</p>

  <p>"If you say that he can actually read the Sanskrit easily, he must have the Ancient God Eyes. It's the only explanation. Moreover, if he can decipher the Truth of Cultivation Nature, the level of his Ancient God Eyes won't be low," remarked Harper, his eyes growing wider in fascination. "One has the Thousand Sanskrit Land, one has the Ancient God Eyes and the other has the inheritance of the shadow of Snake Goddess. Why didn't these bloodlines emerge until now?"</p>

  <p>"This is the will of the Chaos Ancient God. We will attain the final victory," said Lorena triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe." Harper's eyes were full of expectation. "If the Thousand Sanskrit Land that Zheng possesses can indeed grow and become stronger, it certainly has the ability to resolve the present crisis. However, cultivating the Thousand Sanskrit Land requires a large number of Spiritual Darknesses, and you will need your mother's advice on your cultivation method."</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled faintly and said, "That's for sure. Zheng, Yan, you'd better follow Harold's suggestion after leaving the debate venue. But you'd better come to me when you have the chance. Zheng knows where I will be hiding."</p>

  <p>"Alright," Zheng agreed.</p>

  <p>Lorena walked up to Zheng and Yan and hugged them lovingly.</p>

  <p>She was just an incarnation of fear and her real body did not know what had happened there. However, the light cocoon between Zheng's eyebrows was recording everything, and Lorena would know when she met him again.</p>

  <p>As a mother, this was a precious memory for Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you have taken what you want, and even the things that you shouldn't take, it's time for you to leave," said Harper waving his hand.</p>

  <p>"It's time to say goodbye," Lorena smiled wistfully and kissed Yan and Zheng on their foreheads.</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>Yan embraced Lorena tightly. Although it was the first time she had seen her mother, the blood tie was unbreakable.</p>

  <p>Then, Lorena's body turned into little red dots and disappeared right before Yan's eyes.</p>
