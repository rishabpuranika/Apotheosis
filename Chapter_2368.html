  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You hold on yourself first!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle said without looking back. She held the chain while approaching Zheng.</p>

  <p>The head was the part of the Heavenly Wheel Snake that was shaking the most violently. On the other hand, its body, which Zheng and Rachelle were clinging onto, was much more stable.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to glide backward on the smooth back of the Heavenly Wheel Snake with the Great Weighty Sword leaning against his chest. In the face of Rachelle's fierce attack, Zheng fought back while retreating. It was obvious that Rachelle couldn't take him down in just a short moment.</p>

  <p>However, Shahn, who was on the head of the snake, was in danger. He was barely hanging onto the long sword and could be thrown out at any time.</p>

  <p>At this moment, several consummate True Gods appeared at the entrance of the pillar.</p>

  <p>The goal of all these consummate True Gods was the same— to get the jade seal. Now that they had managed to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple, there was no reason for them to give up.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavenly Wheel Snake was retracting too fast for them to catch up with it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, although the Heavenly Wheel Temple was enormous, it had only one path; they just needed to follow it all the way on the path.</p>

  <p>"Shahn!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Walton entered, he saw Shahn hanging onto the sword and dangling in the air. His eyes widened as he said, "Don't worry. I'll help you out!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods might not be able to use Godly Ways, but they had brought with them a lot of magic weapons. Walton gently patted his wrist, summoning a big dark red crossbow. On the back of the crossbow, there was a huge capstan, around which there were golden ropes that coiled into loops.</p>

  <p>He grabbed one end of the golden rope and threw it at the bottom of the pillar. After falling, the red crossbow, under the control of the golden rope, swung back from the other side of the pillar like a pendulum bob.</p>

  <p>Walton jumped up and caught the red crossbow. Quickly tying the golden rope into a knot, he knelt on one knee and aimed at the head of the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>A shining red bolt, with the golden rope tied to it, shot toward the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Very few consummate True Gods in the divine land would be equipped with weapons like crossbows. The Earth Godly Way that Walton cultivated was very special. Although it was a powerful Godly Way, it wasn't perfect in terms of flexibility. Therefore, Walton always carried all sorts of magic weapons with him.</p>

  <p>This Fire God Wrath was an extremely powerful supreme primordial weapon. The bolts it shot were enough to hurt any consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The thick bowstring was still vibrating, and the bolt, which was as thick as an arm, had already penetrated through the snake's lower jaw and come out from its upper jaw!</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake raised its huge head and let out a pained cry.</p>

  <p>But the bolt, with the golden rope tied to it, had penetrated its mouth and firmly fixed it into place. The snake could not break the rope, so it could not continue to retract backward.</p>

  <p>Walton easily lifted the heavy crossbow with one hand and twisted his neck with ease, producing a cracking sound. He laughed and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Shahn, come down quickly!"</p>

  <p>After having held onto the sword for such a long time, Shahn was trembling in shock. But as soon as he heard Walton's words, he jumped and grabbed the rope. Then, he slid down the rope onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The truth was, in terms of strength alone, Shahn was actually slightly superior to Rachelle and Walton.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how strong he was, he had always relied on his Godly Way to display his power. Therefore, after entering this damn place, he had become the weakest.</p>

  <p>"You bitch! How could you do nothing to save me?!" Shahn shouted at Rachelle, his face darkening.</p>

  <p>As the most powerful consummate True God of the Fang Clan, he had always had a high opinion of himself. He had never imagined that he would almost die here.</p>

  <p>"That's how she always is, isn't it?" Walton said, grinning. Then, he continued, "Come and help me pin the snake here. There is only one path in the Heavenly Wheel Temple. The thing that controls the jade seal should be at the end of this huge pillar!"</p>

  <p>Then, he turned to look at the rest of the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Not every consummate True God present here was on the same side as them; some of them were not from the alliance of large clans.</p>

  <p>"If you want to go further, come and help me. As to who will really control the jade seal in the end, it all depends on your methods!" Walton shouted.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods' eyes gleamed with excitement when they heard what Walton said. Without any further hesitation, they rushed forward.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Nelly, who was the last to enter the light curtain, sped over, panting heavily.</p>

  <p>She was much slower than the other consummate True Gods, so she had run with all her might to keep up with them. In an instant, her gaze passed over the snake and landed on Zheng and Rachelle.</p>

  <p>"They are still fighting..."</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Nelly felt helpless.</p>

  <p>She looked around and saw black insects crawling on the colorful lights.</p>

  <p>Her expression changed. She had also entered the world through the time passage, so she naturally understood what those black insects meant.</p>

  <p>With no way to resist them, even consummate True Gods would be completely swallowed up by them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng and Rachelle were locked in a fierce battle without noticing anything that was happening near the head of the snake.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was still relying on the chain to stabilize herself, but she looked fearless.</p>

  <p>Zheng wandered further on the back of the snake, feeling like he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, he had to ensure that he wouldn't fall down. On the other hand, he had to deal with the attacks from Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Ding, ding, ding...</p>

  <p>As Rachelle hovered closer, she struck with her short sword more than ten consecutive times in an instant.</p>

  <p>As the short sword and the Great Weighty Sword collided, sparks flew in all directions. dozens of cracks appeared in the Great Weighty Sword, one of which spread all across the entire blade.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression darkened further.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword was indeed very heavy, but the abilities of Livingston were limited. It couldn't be compared with a supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>The smile on Rachelle's face grew wider. Although she was violent and aggressive, her face was just like a beautiful flower. "Mike must have put in a lot of effort to cultivate you. I wonder if the other stowaway is as outstanding as you? Where has he gone, the other chess piece at the mercy of Mike?"</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled back his Great Weighty Sword before hitting the short sword again with a new wave of energy, forcing Rachelle to take a few steps back. "It's none of your business!" he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that everything is settled. You can't change this situation even if you become a Holy Being, let alone you are only a low-rank True God now," she said, shaking her sword. A beam of sword radiance once again slashed on the middle section of the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The cracks on the Great Weighty Sword began to spread again.</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being?" Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly, and a mocking smile appeared on his face. He shook his head and said, "Your field of vision is too narrow. There are some ideas that you will never be able to figure out!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" When she saw that Zheng didn't seem to be lying, a look of doubt appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know," Zheng said. As he spoke, he waved the Great Weighty Sword again. The sword floated in the air in a strange arc before rushing toward Rachelle's neck.</p>

  <p>Noticing the arc of Zheng's sword, Rachelle flew up into the air and easily dodged the attack.</p>

  <p>But Zheng only smiled faintly. Suddenly, the sword turned and slashed at the chain under Rachelle's feet!</p>

  <p>Zheng managed to cut off the chain in an instant.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Walton and the other consummate True Gods managed to finally pin the snake's head to the pillar.</p>

  <p>Since the big snake was unable to move its head, it began to roll its body side to side in an attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>Unable to keep her footing, Rachelle fell to the side of the snake's back.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>She had never expected such a dramatic reversal. In a moment of desperation, she stabbed the short sword into the snake's body and hung onto the side of the snake. At the same time, Zheng, who was still firmly standing on the back of the snake, pointed his Great Weighty Sword at Rachelle and said indifferently, "There are some chess pieces that you can't easily get rid of."</p>

  <p>Then, the intense sword intent from the Great Weighty Sword began to surge.</p>

  <p>Just as the sword intent was about to shoot out and hit Rachelle, a red figure quickly rushed forward, grabbing Zheng's hand and begging, "Zheng!</p>

  <p>No, please!"</p>
