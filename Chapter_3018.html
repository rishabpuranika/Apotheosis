<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Those Truth Boats stood half a man's height and were incapable of bearing a person's weight. Whatever was in those boats, they certainly weren't human.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng squinted and saw fist-sized gray shadows on the boats. Although he couldn't see them clearly, he was fairly sure they were bugs.</p>

  <p>The Truth Boats themselves also took a strange shape and looked like pumpkins.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering what they were. They are, in fact, the Copper Insect race," Dorothy finally said after staring at the boats.</p>

  <p>"The Copper Insect race?" Luo Zheng's gaze suddenly intensified, the way it did when he examined a possible threat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a race of large demon bugs in the Source World. What's peculiar, however, is that they're rarely seen. As far as I recall, they usually hide in the depths and are not ferocious," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just humans that could reach the Other Shore in this world. Any intelligent creature could? be it snakes, ants, or even beasts. They could enter the Sea of Truth and try to reach the Other Shore, as long as they had the desire to become stronger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew of this. After all, he learned that the king of Man-eating Demon Flowers was able to accomplish the feat. It had even achieved the fifteenth stage of Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>However, it was the first time Luo Zheng had encountered non-humans crossing the Sea of Truth. Genuinely baffled, he blurted out, "Why haven't we encountered any other race before?"</p>

  <p>"Every race crosses the sea at a different section. I guess happening upon these bugs is just a coincidence," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>"The Copper Insect race seems to cultivate Truth of Cultivation Nature,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered as he stared at the strange, pumpkin-shaped Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>Even from afar, he could feel the bugs' aura.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded. "Well, other races seem to have a natural relation to it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that's why most of them cultivate Truth of Cultivation Nature."</p>

  <p>As Dorothy mentioned relation, Luo Zheng was reminded of the ease with which he understood Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. "Is there a Truth of Divine Dao for every warrior?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! Everyone here needs to take a test of compatibility with the Truth of Divine Dao they plan to cultivate. The more compatible, the faster they could comprehend it. For example, I have ninety percent compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. When I started studying the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I easily recited eight thousand and seven hundred words!" Dorothy said proudly.</p>

  <p>"You could recite eight thousand and seven hundred words at your first attempt?" Luo Zheng echoed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, who mistook his reaction for shock, smiled proudly. "Isn't it amazing?"</p>

  <p>"It really is." Luo Zheng nodded. He then immediately asked, "What about a 100% compatibility?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled. "Then that means Instant Enlightenment. Very few people have such an ability. If they do, they are practically guaranteed future success."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know there was a compatibility test between the warrior and their chosen Truth of Divine Dao. If so, he must have had a hundred percent compatibility with Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>He found it extremely difficult to comprehend Truth of Cultivation Nature in the divine land. Now that he thought about it, he must have not been able to relate to it. Of course, he had no other choice at the time, as Truth of Cultivation Nature was the only Truth of Divine Dao to be cultivated.</p>

  <p>"You are amazing too. You have grasped another Truth of Divine Dao so quickly. I prepared for you a token of Truth of Cultivation Nature. Now it seems that you need a token of Truth of Eternal Sword Intent as well."</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled at Luo Zheng as she brought the topic back. She was still interested in Luo Zheng's cultivation of two Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Zheng should easily acquire the token of Truth of Eternal Sword Intent after joining the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to politely decline, two more Truth Boats appeared to his right, both larger and two hundred feet long. Each was occupied by one giant figure.</p>

  <p>He could tell by the silhouettes that they were gigantic beasts.</p>

  <p>They sat still on the boats, unspeaking. The diabolic aura surrounding them reeked of menace and grimness.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, even Dorothy realized something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The only thing that the human race knew about the Sea of Truth was that one had to pass nine lines to cross it. But besides such far too limited knowledge, they knew nothing. None about its width, depth, and most worrying, the secret it contained.</p>

  <p>However, the routes humans took to cross the sea had always been consistent. There was rarely any chance to bump into other races' Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>As such, Dorothy was baffled as to why they had two consecutive encounters with foreign races today.</p>

  <p>"There are more..." Luo Zheng said, seemingly alerting her of something else. He pointed behind himself.</p>

  <p>Five more Truth Boats, this time bound to each other, floated. They were about the same size as the human race's boats, but Luo Zheng could perceive that the silhouettes were that of wolf-shaped creatures.</p>

  <p>The three foreign races seemed to be wary of everyone else, distancing themselves from the others' boats. It seemed clear that they did not want to interfere with each other's businesses.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop first," Dorothy said, with the situation finally dawning on her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to control the speed of his Truth Boat with his mind, but when he started to do so, he merely raised his eyebrow. "The current is changing its direction."</p>

  <p>All boats went against the current in the Sea of Truth. Moreover, the water would flow much quicker past the first line. It would be more difficult to move forward.</p>

  <p>But now the seawater flowed horizontally, completely different from before.</p>

  <p>Dorothy frowned. If this was true, then could it be possible...? "Are you sure that the current's direction has changed?"</p>

  <p>"See for yourself," said Luo Zheng, pursing his lips.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked towards the water, confirming her suspicions. Her voice trembled as she said, "This is bad..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng knew something was amiss, but he couldn't understand why Dorothy was so afraid.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, over a hundred Truth Boats came into view, all withdrawing at an extreme pace. Luo Zheng and Dorothy heard someone scream,</p>

  <p>"Retreat! There's a huge whirlpool in front!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to Dorothy, confused. "There can be large whirlpools in the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and they change the current's direction. That's why we have come across other races' boats," Dorothy said in a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"I know it is a huge whirlpool, but is it that frightening? At worst, we can leave the Sea of Truth first and come back when it disappears," Luo Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It's not as simple as you think. Once a large whirlpool appears in Sea of Truth, it won't disappear," Dorothy replied sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then we can go around it," Luo Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked at Luo Zheng helplessly. "It's useless. The whirlpool is as complex as it is massive. Once you're trapped in it, you won't be able to undo what happens after. I knew of a disciple. His talent was not far from mine, and yet he can never reenter the Sea of Truth. Every time he tries, he gets devoured by the whirlpool and all efforts to reach the Other Shore is futile.</p>

  <p>That is its consequence."</p>
