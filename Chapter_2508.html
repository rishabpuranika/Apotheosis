<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2508 Murphy Was Released </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It would require a warrior's divine might coins to erase the characters on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>In the past, it had required many divine might coins to write these characters, and it would require an equivalent amount of divine might coins to erase these characters too.</p>

  <p>The limitations and targets of each rule on the Ruling Slate were unique, so one had to consume differing amounts of divine might coins to either write or wipe out the characters on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>For example, the 93rd rule applied to the prohibition of the Holy Beings from attacking each other's universe directly. The restriction was not particularly strong, and it was not aimed at any one person directly.</p>

  <p>Therefore, not many divine might coins were required to write this rule.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' brush constantly swiped across the rule on the huge slate.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins stowed in his brocade bag disappeared one by one, and turned into a special kind of energy. He then applied his huge black brush to the slate.</p>

  <p>The words "divine eras" in the 93rd rule started to blur and finally were erased completely from the stone plate.</p>

  <p>After erasing the two words, Nicholas checked his brocade bag. As he had expected, it hadn't cost many divine might coins to erase the two words.</p>

  <p>Of course, the total number of divine might coins that had been consumed was awe inspiring, even by the standards of some powerful clans on the Floating Islands. But Nicholas didn't care one way or the other.</p>

  <p>Then he continued to wave the ink brush in his hand through the air and created a new word, "years," replacing the words, "divine eras."</p>

  <p>According to the previous sentencing, Murphy had been supposed to be imprisoned for three whole divine eras. However, now after the rule had been revised, he only needed to face a prison penalty of three years.</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas painted the new rule, the whole Ruling Slate glowed with a luminous mist, which meant that the new rule began to take effect.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the cave within the huge mountain, the invisible energy that bound the cave had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The moment Murphy had become trapped within the cave, he was surrounded and suppressed by the invisible energy.</p>

  <p>This energy could only affect him, and no one else would feel it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, other warriors were permitted to enter the cave and visit Murphy at any time they wished, but Murphy was restrained from leaving.</p>

  <p>"What? The invisible energy has disappeared!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden gleam in his eyes, Murphy, whose hair had grown lank and was disheveled, rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a figure hovered over from the entrance of the cave. It was none other than Nicholas!</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, what's happening?" A puzzled expression settled on Murphy's face.</p>

  <p>"I revised the rule of the Ruling Slate," Nicholas replied with an indifferent shrug.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Murphy exclaimed, utterly confused.</p>

  <p>Although he had faced a lengthy imprisonment here, he was still somewhat aware of the goings on in the outside world. Whenever something momentous happened in the world beyond the cave, his daughter, Rachelle, would come and report to him.</p>

  <p>He knew that the alliance of wealthy clans had lost in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>They had not only failed to stop Luo Zheng, but had also lost many warriors' lives in the process.</p>

  <p>"Murphy, you have also sensed the shock that echoed across the divine land some time ago, right?" asked Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Murphy nodded his head glumly.</p>

  <p>"By all appearances, it would seem that the divine land won't crash any longer. So we have to take the initiative and do something about that," said Nicholas coldly.</p>

  <p>"What do you have in mind, Nicholas?" A wicked gleam flashed across Murphy's eyes.</p>

  <p>The wealthy clans, including the Leng Clan, the Mu Clan and the Tang Clan, had their own selfish reasons for joining the alliance of wealthy clans, which the Dongfang Clan had established.</p>

  <p>If the divine land crashed, all of the creatures living in the divine land would be destroyed. Within the other wealthy clans, only the Holy Beings could survive the impact. Even their inner worlds would be destroyed in the crash.</p>

  <p>But the warriors within the alliance of wealthy clans wouldn't perish.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had already prepared a back-up plan to accommodate them.</p>

  <p>He would not only remove the rule that limited the number of True Gods in a universe from the Ruling Slate, but he would also separate all of the universes from the divine land before its crash.</p>

  <p>Those chosen Holy Beings, including Murphy, would lead their clansmen, following after Nicholas, and head to the Source World, which was much wider than the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Help me seize control of the Abyss Demon Region," Nicholas ordered indifferently. "The power of the Abyss Demon Region is mighty enough to destroy the entire divine land."</p>

  <p>"You want to control the Abyss Demon Region?!"</p>

  <p>Murphy's eyebrows twitched.</p>

  <p>For the Holy Beings, there weren't many places where they could not go in the divine land.</p>

  <p>For example, places like the debate venue and the Time Sea might prove dangerous for Holy Beings to break into, but they could still survive.</p>

  <p>However, controlling the Abyss Demon Region was a different task altogether.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was renowned as a sixth-grade forbidden area, but even the Holy Beings had failed to set foot on the first stage of the region.</p>

  <p>"It's not possible to control the Abyss Demon Region." Murphy shook his head. "In that area, countless evil faith of the divine land has gathered for innumerable years. Can we really seize control of it?"</p>

  <p>"He will help us," Nicholas confidently quipped up.</p>

  <p>"That Yellow Emperor Guard?" Murphy questioned.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Nicholas. "Time grows short. Even if we don't take action now, the Luo Clan will make its move sooner or later. Lorena...</p>

  <p>She will surely move on this soon too."</p>

  <p>A helpless expression flooded Murphy's face at the mention of that name.</p>

  <p>In his heart, Murphy admired Nicholas very much. No matter his talent, intelligence, willpower, and patience, Nicholas was an outstanding man whom few Holy Beings could compare with.</p>

  <p>However, a great man like him still had a weakness for a certain woman.</p>

  <p>That woman was from the Nine Li race and even had a son and a daughter with Mike, and yet Nicholas still couldn't get over her. Murphy didn't understand his weakness.</p>

  <p>But since Nicholas had consented to do this, Murphy couldn't refute him.</p>

  <p>The two of them were on the same side, and they had similar goals, not to mention that Nicholas never failed in his promises.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been cultivating his skills within the Sunrest Tree Region for less than half a month.</p>

  <p>However, at this stage, Luo Zheng was only able to concentrate on the comprehension of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. He had not improved his cultivation significantly, and he was still a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had almost grasped the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand and felt the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, he, Harold, and Yan left the debate venue.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng activated the token of mountain, he had directly returned to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>He had only been away from the Immortal Mansion for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that Xun could rely on her own comprehension to prove the Divine Dao within such a short time span.</p>

  <p>However, Xun was still unable to enter the divine land without permission. After she had become an ordinary creature, she would not be split apart by the divine land. However, if she entered the divine land, she would still be sensed by the Ruling Slate and would be punished by it.</p>

  <p>But this time, they had Harold to accompany them. Once he had learned about Xun's situation, he immediately assumed all the responsibility.</p>

  <p>After all, it was Mike who had taught Harold how to change someone's blood. In turn, it was Harold who had ordered Wynn to enter the Evolutionary Universe and establish the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>If Harold could help them change their blood and they could become True Gods in the future, they would then be able to walk freely in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Making his way back to the Immortal Mansion, Luo Zheng did not see Hallet or Augustus. Even Joy was nowhere to be found in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Apparently, after she had sent Luo Zheng to the Non-combat Zone, Joy had quickly returned to the Swirl Forest and helped Hallet and Augustus to control the Swirl Forest. So far, they had not returned yet.</p>

  <p>Besides, Bromley had already formulated his own plans on controlling the Swirl Forest. Therefore, Harold had no intention of interfering in that.</p>

  <p>The most important thing for Luo Zheng to do now was to visit his mother and make a breakthrough in his own cultivation base.</p>
