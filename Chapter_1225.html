  <p>
</p>

  <p>These seven warriors were all Spirit Supreme Realm masters and Max was probably the most powerful among them.</p>

  <p>But even though they were remarkable, they still ran away from the Shadow Creature. So what was hiding in the dark behind of this world?</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng was curious about this.</p>

  <p>Before Max could reply, Delroy said, "That is the God Despised Race."</p>

  <p>"The God Despised Race?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated, his eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded and said, "It is a race that is despised by the gods.</p>

  <p>Although the Shadow Creatures are divided into many races, the largest of them is the God Despised Race."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng and the others were listening curiously, Max nodded and said, "Delroy is right."</p>

  <p>Even the universe had a back side, but compared to that of the great world, the space of the Upper World was much more stable and hence, more difficult to tear apart.</p>

  <p>At the back side of the whole universe was a large, empty world. Though the Shadow Creatures were rare, their actual number in the back side of the universe wasn't small. The God Despised Race ruled absolutely over the Shadow Creatures. They couldn't leave the back side of the world, but they still had a great influence on the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"A race despised by the gods... Why do the gods despise them, though?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Max laughed, shook his head, and said, "I have no idea. Perhaps the world lords and Supreme Lords know the reason."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, but he had an extremely uncomfortable feeling, as if there was something unknown invading his body. A sense of foreboding took over his mind as he continued to ask, "Then why would the God Despised Race enter this great world?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was well aware of this sense of crisis. Ever since he had fused with the will of the great world, he had gradually become one with the entire great world. And now that he knew about the existence of such a terrifying thing at the back side of the great world, he naturally felt foreboding creep through him.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, but I will report this to the Celestial Position race. But whether the Celestial Position race investigates the matter or not is not up to me," Max said, looking straight ahead.</p>

  <p>The God Despised Race was mysterious and strong, so the Spirit Supreme Realm masters would not be able to interfere with the race's actions or resist them. Max's current task was just to search for the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. No matter what these Shadow Creatures wanted to do, he couldn't interfere with them with his current strength. It was better to rush back first.</p>

  <p>After the Eight-diagram Wheel had burned Hank's blood essence, its flying speed had multiplied, surpassing Luo Zheng's expectations. When the storm had stopped, Luo Luo Zheng had spent several days traversing the entire Chaotic Ocean of Stars, but this time, it had taken them only four hours.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, the Eight-diagram Wheel dashed out of the huge storm, confronted by a pitch-black object that seemed to rise slowly out of the horizon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed at the black object. That was a corner of the Central Region. He became excited as he saw it. He had finally returned after roving around the four divine kingdoms for nearly half a year.</p>

  <p>As the easternmost continent of the Central Region, the Fish Dragon Sect had remained intact despite quite a few upheavals.</p>

  <p>And as Luo Luo Zheng and the others approached, they could see many warriors of the Fish Dragon Sect cultivating in front of the sect gate.</p>

  <p>A tiny black dot came into being in the air, flying towards them at the terrifying speed above the sea.</p>

  <p>But it disappeared in a flash in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Master, what is that thing?" a young warrior asked.</p>

  <p>"It is just an illusion. Do you understand? It's your illusion. Focus on practicing!" an elder scolded.</p>

  <p>"Is this really an illusion? I think I see it too...</p>

  <p>Perhaps even Luo Luo Zheng, the top warrior in the Central Region, cannot fly at such a high speed..."</p>

  <p>"Looks like we are all hallucinating at the same time!"</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had killed Eddie, he had gained considerable prestige in the Central Region and replaced Eddie as the strongest warrior in the Central Region. All kinds of stories about Luo Luo Zheng were spreading among the warriors.</p>

  <p>But the Central Region had fallen into chaos during Luo Zheng's absence.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect that had been destroyed by the Heavenly Evil Sect had been rebuilt. Although the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the Ethereal City had been attacked and damaged, some of the key figures had survived. With the rich resources of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, it could have been rebuilt in a short period of time. But since many of its members had been killed, its recovery had fallen to a snail's pace. It would take hundreds of years to return to being a top sect of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Apart from this, Simon, the Poison King, seemed to be making a move again. He had gathered some members of the Heavenly Evil Sect, and it looked like they were trying to stage a comeback after the attack had failed.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had killed Eddie, Simon had quickly escaped and hidden in the Dreamy Swampland where he had earlier lived in for hundreds of years. He was probably tired of living there in seclusion. So when he learned news that Luo Luo Zheng had gone to the four divine kingdoms, he had begun plotting.</p>

  <p>If only Luo Luo Zheng made use of the will of the great world and looked into these matters, he could figure out what was happening. He knew everything about the great world, now that he had fused with the will of the great world. And as long as he concentrated for even a short while, he could get any information he wanted.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had never used this ability a lot. He only ever used it to occasionally check on Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>It had taken the Eight-Diagram Wheel only four hours to travel across the vast Chaotic Ocean of Stars that could probably accommodate a hundred Central Regions.</p>

  <p>So once they had entered the Central Region, it took them only five minutes to get to Oracle City.</p>

  <p>As they arrived, Max looked down on the Oracle City and asked, "Is this it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Woody said, "Hurry up and go. We'll wait for you here."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned to them and asked, "Since you've come all the way here, would you like to..."</p>

  <p>"No! We are not interested in this sort of a place," Delroy remarked arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Max didn't say anything, and the others sat cross-legged, their eyes closed, as if they were asleep.</p>

  <p>'These guys are really cocky. I was just politely inviting them, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, rolling his eyes. He then prepared to leave the Eight-diagram Wheel.</p>

  <p>But just as he began to leave, he heard Dorothea say, "Luo Luo Zheng, I'll accompany you!"</p>

  <p>Woody chuckled and said, "Dorothea, this place is far inferior to even the Divine Kingdom Continent. Why do you still want to go?"</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business," Dorothea said and jumped down with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dorothea probably thought that Delroy and Woody had been too haughty and gone too far. She said to Luo Luo Zheng, "Don't think too much about what they say. They are from the Upper World and are born with arrogance!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. He hadn't taken this to heart at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had met a lot of arrogant warriors since he had started cultivating martial arts. He had traveled to many places and noticed that there was no dearth of such people in the C County, the Imperial Capital, the Cloud Sect, and the Cloud Hall. He had gotten used to this kind of arrogance.</p>

  <p>Though the six warriors on the Eight-diagram Wheel were Spirit Supreme Realm masters, they were all arrogant like other ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>Two figures shot down from the sky and headed directly for the Heavenly Stellar Palace.</p>

  <p>Through the memories of the great world, Luo Luo Zheng knew that Ning Yudie had been at the Heavenly Stellar Palace for the past half year. He was in a hurry to meet her and wasn't even bothered to inform the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng landed in the Heavenly Stellar Palace, hundreds of runes suddenly appeared around it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Dorothea were almost blinded as all the runes simultaneously emitted rays of brilliant light. The light flew towards Luo Luo Zheng and Dorothea.</p>

  <p>"Do you have a death wish?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea did not know what was going on, and became angry as the flower in her right eye started spinning.</p>

  <p>The power of these rays of light was nothing to Dorothea, but the consequences of attacking her would be severe. She could strike back with a strength that could debilitate anyone.</p>
