<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1878 Threat And Enticement (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Skyland race differed fundamentally from the Collapsing Mountain race in terms of cultivation methods, because Skyland race cultivated through the Pristine Life Vitality and Collapsing Mountain race cultivated by the strength force.</p>

  <p>Since the Collapsing Mountain race only refined their bodies, just infusing the strength source was fine. Besides, they had sufficient food supplies and they didn't need the help from other races. Therefore, this race treated all other races equally and rarely favored one, except Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race, on the other hand, had a great demand for cultivation methods and even weapons from the divine land. Other races from the divine land naturally catered to the Skyland race's likes, and there was no exception for Qin Clan. Thus, the Skyland race took special care of warriors like Quentin Qin.</p>

  <p>Quentin Qin thought that he could overwhelm Luo Luo Zheng with his strength, and with the help of the Skyland race, where could these people run? If they dared escape from Skyland race, that would be even better. The Qin Clan had been placed in position of power in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, so they could do whatever they wanted!</p>

  <p>As she saw that Quentin Qin was about to make his move, Lucille's pupils suddenly constricted. The killing intent that was hidden in the depths of her heart ignited.</p>

  <p>Kurt stood with one palm erect, and the strength of his other hand that was holding the monk staff increased slightly!</p>

  <p>Compared to the other two, Lone understood the warriors from the divine land a bit more. After all, the broken sword in his hand originated from the divine land. He knew that it would be a futile attempt if they were to make a move against Quentin Qin at this moment. But if Quentin Qin would make any move against them, they would resist.</p>

  <p>"Master Qin, don't be so ruthless," said Lone. He was already quite hopeless about their situation.</p>

  <p>Quentin Qin took two steps forward. When he sensed that it was the right time, he sneered and stared at Luo Luo Zheng as he said, "Of course, you can keep the Pristine Life Vitality, but I have one condition. Just now, your friend had some methods up his sleeve. With this method, he can refine quite much Pristine Life Vitality. I will let all of you leave safe and sound, if you tell me the methods. As for that pile of Pristine Life Vitality, I will let you keep it as a gift!"</p>

  <p>This was threat and enticement.</p>

  <p>While he threatened to make a move, he also had the ability to bestow Pristine Life Vitality to his opponent. His timing and tricks were quite accurate.</p>

  <p>When he finished speaking, all of the other warriors from the divine land on the platform revealed expressions of 'I knew this was going to happen', and quietly waited for this situation to unfold.</p>

  <p>Lucille and the other two looked at Luo Luo Zheng simultaneously. Quentin Qin had finally revealed his true intention after going around the bushes!</p>

  <p>Han Liusu sat down on the ground. When she waved her fingers gently, crystals of Pristine Life Vitality continuously flew into her hands. Then she caught them and daintily put them into her mouth, as if she were eating some snacks. She ate them one by one, looking at the scene with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>She had already known about Quentin's temperament, but she did not expect that things would turn out better than she expected. If Luo Luo Zheng would show his true abilities, this fellow would surely suffer greatly. At this moment, her mood was naturally very comfortable!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just stood on the spot and didn't utter a single word. He glared coldly at Quentin Qin.</p>

  <p>He had seen through Liusu's intentions long ago. She wanted to use him to teach Quentin a lesson, but Luo Luo Zheng did not want to play along with her plans. He intended to settle this matter right from the start...</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Luo Luo Zheng had underestimated Quentin's tyranny. Seeing Luo Zheng's methods of Pristine Life Vitality refinement, Quentin was determined to get them. His aggressiveness had even involved Lucille and the other two. Now, Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of backing down.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng still paid no mind to Quentin Qin. Instead, he addressed Han Liusu and asked, "Is this what you want?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu only smiled in reply, and took another black crystal into her mouth.</p>

  <p>In one quick motion, Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his forefinger and flicked it with his thumb. "I don't like people using me. I hope this is the last time."</p>

  <p>After calmly saying this, an extremely powerful, concentrated stream of energy condensed on the tip of his finger!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gathered all the strength in his body, including that of Eight Path Platforms, and focused it entirely in his forefinger. This finger was only three inches away from Liusu's forehead, and she instantly felt an enormous pressure!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had flicked out his finger, her entire head would have been pulverized and there was no doubt that she would have died in an instant!</p>

  <p>Feeling this pressure, Liusu's face was drained of color. She saw that Luo Zheng's expression was deathly serious, and it didn't seem like he was joking.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flicked his finger, and it landed on Liusu's forehead.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Han Liusu had been scared half to death.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's ability to control his strength had already reached its peak. Other than the nine stars power that he could not fully control yet, it could be said that he had proficient control of his strength.</p>

  <p>The moment he flicked his finger, all of the power dissipated. It only left a faint red mark on her forehead!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned around and took a deep breath. He smiled to Quentin Qin and said, "On this platform, I have to break both my legs before I can leave.</p>

  <p>This rule is indeed interesting, but what if I don't want to leave?"</p>
