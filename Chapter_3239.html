<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A look of despair appeared on Seamus' face when he saw that Zheng was unharmed. Seamus couldn't believe that after he had unleashed an all-out strike, he didn't cause even a little damage to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng released a small portion of his strength, staring coldly at Seamus as he prepared to crush his soul. But Efrain suddenly shouted, "Don't kill him!"</p>

  <p>Seamus had started this entire incident because he wanted to get revenge on Milo who injured his younger brother.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious the people of the Bearing race had used that as an excuse to attack and kill as many Oneness Sky Palace disciples as they could.</p>

  <p>This event would leave a lasting impact. It would cause a dispute between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race that would linger for a long time. But Efrain realized that as long as Seamus was alive, they could use him to gather evidence against the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>At Efrain's words, Zheng paused, halting his attack.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's astonishment, at the precise moment that he stopped his strike, Seamus' Soul of Light began twisting and contorting. Seamus let out a series of strange, piteous screams.</p>

  <p>There was an awful ripping sound.</p>

  <p>Seamus' Soul of Light was torn into pieces in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was dumbfounded. "I didn't kill him!"</p>

  <p>Efrain frowned. "He was killed. Someone else killed him."</p>

  <p>As they entered the Other Shore with their Souls of Light, their bodies still remained somewhere in the Source World. Efrain was suggesting that someone near Seamus' body in the Source World had been responsible for his death.</p>

  <p>The failure of their trick had brought many members of the Bearing race back to the Source World. Now that Seamus was unable to go back, there must be something wrong with him.</p>

  <p>Some powerful warriors could know from the souls of their juniors what happened in the Other Shore. When some masters of the Bearing race found that Seamus had been captured, they killed him immediately.</p>

  <p>"Damn it," swore Zheng, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Wait, why does your voice sound familiar?" Efrain asked, glancing at Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>Except for Dorothy, the others didn't know Zheng's real identity. He had consciously lowered his voice so they wouldn't recognize him.</p>

  <p>But in the heat of the moment, Zheng had forgotten to alter his voice, so he caught Efrain's attention.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Efrain was not expecting Zheng to be here. Zheng cleared his throat and lowered his voice again, ignoring Efrain's question. "I just didn't expect the Bearing race to be so decisive."</p>

  <p>Cupping his hands toward Zheng, Efrain said, "I agree, and thank you very much for your help, sir. May I know your name?"</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned. "Just call me Tianxing."</p>

  <p>Zheng's family name, Luo, was rare in the Oneness Sky Palace. So he decided to use only "Tianxing" as his name.</p>

  <p>Efrain nodded, repeating the name silently to himself. He would keep Tianxing in mind when they left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>More disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace swarmed around Zheng, peppering him with questions.</p>

  <p>Standing in the crowd, Sophia looked at Zheng. She had suspected him to be Zheng before. Now she was certain. Yet she could see that Zheng didn't intend to reveal his identity, so neither would she. She would not expose him against his will especially after he had just saved everyone's lives.</p>

  <p>"All right, let's go back to the temple first," Zheng said, fending off the questions everyone was asking him.</p>

  <p>Many disciples had been killed. Some were injured, their souls damaged by the Champion Fish. Milo was also still in a coma. They had no time to waste.</p>

  <p>The group gathered everyone who had sustained injuries and headed back to the temple.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stayed where she was. As soon as everyone was gone, she went to Zheng. "So now what? What are we going to do next?"</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed coldly at the temple of the Bearing race. His eyes narrowed, and he sneered, "Next, I want to tear down this temple!"</p>

  <p>"Tear down their temple?" Dorothy raised her eyebrows. It sounded like a crazy plan.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," Zheng said as he walked towards the temple.</p>

  <p>Even before this latest incident, Zheng had wanted to demolish the temple of the Bearing race. At that time, however, there was peace between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race, so he didn't take any action.</p>

  <p>Now that they were in the middle of a full-blown conflict, he had no qualms about finally destroying their temple.</p>

  <p>"All right," Dorothy sighed.</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy was a bit concerned, she didn't hesitate. If Zheng was determined, then she would support him fully.</p>

  <p>During what had happened on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace in the Source World was alert as well.</p>

  <p>So many elites of the Oneness Sky Palace were in a precarious situation as they were trapped. Their deaths would be a huge loss to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Moreover, many of them were mountains' direct descendants. Even when this incident had just happened, some disciples in the temple quickly returned to the Source World and reported it to the elders of their mountains.</p>

  <p>Masters of the seven mountains gathered together to discuss how to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>Athemar showed up to join in the meeting.</p>

  <p>At first, the masters considered the possibility that the Bearing race intended to declare a war. But that didn't seem to fit.</p>

  <p>A true, all-out war among the superpowers would be devastating for all involved. And if the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had wanted to do the most damage, it would have been better for them to attack the Oneness Sky Palace with all their powers instead of provoking a small-scale war on the Other Shore. It didn't make sense as this kind of action would only alert the powerful leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace and put them on guard.</p>

  <p>As more and more news came from Stage Four of the Other Shore, the masters of the seven mountains soon grasped that the people of the Bearing race were killing the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, using revenge on Milo as an excuse.</p>

  <p>As the Bearing race grew more and more powerful, they knew that the Oneness Sky Palace would hesitate before going to war against them. Now they had managed to eliminate a number of elites from the Oneness Sky Palace with a convenient excuse. Blaming their actions on Milo allowed them to evade responsibility for what they had just done. After all, they could claim that it was Milo who had started the conflict, and they were just trying to avenge one of their own.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it didn't even matter whether or why Milo had injured Seamus' brother. The only thing that mattered was that getting revenge on Milo was a story plausible enough that the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't refute.</p>

  <p>Over the span of several hours, the masters of the seven mountains had tried to contact the Bearing race through various channels, but the news that had been sent back was discouraging.</p>

  <p>Some who replied were evasive and dishonest. Some outright ignored them.</p>

  <p>There were even a few who accused the masters of allowing their disciple to hurt the people of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>All this filled the masters of the seven mountains with righteous indignation. Some of the masters, including Yasamin, were furious enough to suggest directly confronting the Bearing race. Yasamin was indignant because her beloved granddaughter was involved in the conflict.</p>

  <p>They were discussing countermeasures when a new report arrived.</p>

  <p>"Report! According to the message from disciples in the temple, most of the elite disciples of our palace have managed to get to safety!"</p>

  <p>This news was quite welcome. The masters were initially surprised, then their shock gave way to joy.</p>

  <p>The information they had previously collected had seemed to suggest that their elites probably wouldn't be able to survive. The risk of this terrible outcome had prompted them to beg for a pardon for their elites from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Bearing race has given in."</p>

  <p>"Good news."</p>

  <p>"We must verify that they are truly safe as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>As they celebrated, another news arrived. This time, the report came from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"Report! Message from the Bearing race!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?"' asked the head of the Golden Mountain quickly. "Tell us the news."</p>

  <p>The man reporting the news replied, "They beg us to pardon them. They want us to stop tearing down their temple."</p>

  <p>The mountain heads and the warriors who were present looked at each other in confusion, unsure as to what this was about. Who was destroying the temple of the Bearing race?</p>
