</p>

  <p>Pascal also had a great opportunity to obtain a lot of strength source.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the cultivation he developed was quite special as it allowed him to unleash all his strength in just one punch.</p>

  <p>The moment his fist hit its target, Pascal's body lost its strength and he fell on the ground. The golden square stone was a good 140 feet from its initial place and it had taken all of Pascal's strength to move it.</p>

  <p>Back then, such distance was enough to place the warrior within the top ten.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the title of wild king, Pascal chose to remain in the Collapsing Mountain race to train.</p>

  <p>Once, the hunting team ran into trouble and after their leader died, Pascal had single-handedly led the team to safety. Later he became the leader of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy becoming the leader, especially since he was an outsider.</p>

  <p>Many of the Collapsing Mountain members weren't willing to be ruled by a foreigner. And even though Pascal had made big contributions to the Collapsing Mountain race, a lot of them still disliked him.</p>

  <p>Outsiders, after all, were inferior in the eyes of the Collapsing Mountain warriors even if many of the martial artists came from the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was only natural that they didn't wish for a wild king to appear as it would most likely just result in another outsider becoming their leader.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing there were a lot of warriors who got the title of "super powerful warrior", but ultimately, not a single wild king had appeared.</p>

  <p>Chapman turned a page in the list of names with his big hand and with wide eyes, he shouted, "Luo Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>Once his name was called, everyone's eyes immediately fell on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting in the crowd for a long time.</p>

  <p>Earlier on, when Han Liusu first brought Luo Luo Zheng to the Collapsing Mountain race, he had also attracted a lot of attention.</p>

  <p>And while Luo Luo Zheng was a secondary creature not worth paying attention to, Han Liusu had quite the reputation.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists from the other races had heard of Han Liusu of the Han Clan and all of them wondered why she had come to the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Later on, it became clear that the princess came with Luo Luo Zheng, but none of them still knew the true purpose of her visit.</p>

  <p>That said, a small portion of people did know about the abnormal flame Han Liusu emitted.</p>

  <p>This abnormal flame could burn almost anything which was why the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan paid so much attention to his daughter.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the flame did not scare Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Compared to those from the Collapsing Mountain race, more martial artists from other races in the divine land got much more shocked to see Luo Luo Zheng unaffected by the strange flame that covered his body.</p>

  <p>Later on, they laughed on the inside as they watched Luo Luo Zheng be thrown into the bonfire to roast, because even though the fire from the Calamity Dispelling Wood was not to be underestimated, it was still insignificant in the eyes of the people in the divine land. If Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid of Liusu's flames, would a bonfire like this scare him?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng became the envy of many warriors soon after he earned the respect of the Collapsing Mountain race. Some of them believed that he had a magical ability and some even used secret methods to spread the news to other races.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not belong to the divine land. He knew practically nothing about the land's structure, affairs, or issues.</p>

  <p>As for Han Liusu, she definitely knew about matters concerning the divine land. She knew of the internal conflict happening within the Collapsing Mountain warriors as well as the cliques that had been formed by the warriors from other races.</p>

  <p>However, given her position and background, she didn't quite see these things as worthy of her attention.</p>

  <p>Chapman was looking forward to Luo Zheng's performance. He was hoping Luo Luo Zheng could obtain the title of "super powerful warrior" so that he could bring him along to finish an important task.</p>

  <p>However, Chapman found himself a bit worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was only in the Spirit Supreme Realm after all. He knew that the cultivation base did not represent a martial artist's strength, but the higher the cultivation base was, the bigger strength source he would be able to bear.</p>

  <p>Almost all the martial artists that entered the Collapsing Mountain race were in the Spirit Transformation Realm. Many top-level Spirit Transformation Realm warriors and warriors who were almost world lords also entered that race.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Zheng's current cultivation base was still a restriction for him.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" Chapman smiled amiably at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The man nodded. "Yes, I'm ready!"</p>

  <p>He always saw Chapman in a positive light. Although he was a bit rough, he was sincere and genuine.</p>

  <p>The man had asked something from Luo Luo Zheng which was why he gave Luo Luo Zheng special treatment.</p>

  <p>"Are you confident you'll obtain the title of 'super powerful warrior'?"</p>

  <p>Chapman asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked and shook his head. "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>Teigan, who was standing nearby, almost choked in surprise.</p>

  <p>He felt somewhat disappointed.</p>

  <p>He had also contributed to discovering the black and white Eight-diagram Ball that could control the gravity in the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for him and Luo Luo Zheng, would the people present here be even able to obtain so much strength source? In their dreams, maybe.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when he jumped into the lake, the amount of strength he could absorb was limited. He was no different from a martial artist that could obtain a pool of the strength source.</p>

  <p>In the end, he only got the title of "mighty warrior".</p>

  <p>To be candid, this result was much more than Teigan had anticipated.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Sacred Spring Mountain, his ultimate goal was to get title of "outstanding warrior". But now, the premise and situation had changed, and even if he obtained the title of "mighty warrior", he still felt disappointed.</p>

  <p>But the sight of Luo Luo Zheng absorbing a great amount of strength source from the lake was still very much fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>Even now, he still couldn't figure out where Luo Luo Zheng had transferred and stored the strength source. It was impossible for him to keep so much strength source alone.</p>

  <p>'Is Luo Luo Zheng really not confident he can obtain the title?' Teigan eyed Luo Luo Zheng with disdain. The man didn't even blink when he lied. And what was the point of lying anyway? Luo Luo Zheng had already shown strength that exceeded his when he pushed the stone door.</p>

  <p>However, Chapman remained calm when he heard Luo Zheng's answer. After being with Luo Luo Zheng for half a year, he roughly understood his personality.</p>

  <p>"Please," he said with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>Since Chapman had asked questions, the other martial artists began to discuss Luo Zheng's strength as well.</p>

  <p>"How far can this guy push the square stone?"</p>

  <p>"There must be something special about him if he has an innate token that great. If he absorbed enough strength source, I think he'll be able to push the stone for five feet. There shouldn't be much of a problem in getting the title of 'super powerful warrior'!"</p>

  <p>"Humph. The kid's just not afraid of flames; that doesn't mean a lot.</p>

  <p>Maybe he won't even get the title of 'outstanding warrior'." "Aren't you underestimating him too much?"</p>

  <p>"What if he can't move it at all? Let's not forget he's merely in the Spirit Supreme Realm and is only a secondary creature."</p>

  <p>All sorts of opinions were being expressed, and it didn't take long for the Collapsing Mountain warriors to join in on the discussion.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other martial artists, the Collapsing Mountain warriors had less knowledge of Luo Luo Zheng and naturally, didn't think too highly of him.</p>

  <p>"This guy's body is so small, and my arm's thicker than him! Bet he won't be able to move the square stone for more than an inch!"</p>

  <p>"I know!"</p>

  <p>"Still, this guy is useful to us. I hope he performs well."</p>

  <p>Teigan's lips trembled upon hearing these words.</p>

  <p>It looked like Luo Luo Zheng might even obtain the title of "wild king".</p>

  <p>However, given the difference between his and his friends' perspectives, it would be best not to say anything at all.</p>

  <p>"Kennan," Han Liusu called. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say." Kennan shook his head.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu blinked. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu paid so much attention to Luo Luo Zheng, so Kennan and the others also did the same.</p>

  <p>But even as they watched Luo Luo Zheng progress at an incredible speed, they still could not figure out why this was happening and why Luo Luo Zheng had been able to withstand Liusu's flames.</p>

  <p>Those flames were unstoppable, and only true experts would be able to extinguish them. And even then, it didn't mean that the experts did not fear the special flame.</p>

  <p>However, being fireproof did not determine Luo Zheng's actual strength, which was why Kennan decided to tell Han Liusu a safe answer.</p>

  <p>The princess however, wasn't really expecting an answer, but she was still full of anticipation. She didn't expect Luo Luo Zheng to surpass her brother, but she hoped he would at least get the title of "super powerful warrior".</p>

  <p>But there was no point in discussing it now. Luo Luo Zheng was ready to go.</p>

  <p>He was like an iron tower, standing in front of the golden square stone.</p>

  <p>With his fists clenched tightly, Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his arms. His eyes gleamed and he looked absolutely intimidating as his whole being radiated with strength and confidence.</p>
