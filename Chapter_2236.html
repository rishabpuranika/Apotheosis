<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Because the Arena of Legends existed, a powerful warrior on the Floating Island would soon attract attention.</p>

  <p>For example, when Aleyna placed second among the proving godly warriors in just a couple of years, the wealthy clans knew that she was destined to be a new star of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Irrespective of whether they were weak or powerful, warriors could always find opponents to match their level of strength. The Arena of Legends was not only for battles of strength; it could also prove to everyone a warrior's talent and their future.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also done well in this arena, winning all of his battles.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't climbed up to obtain a rank. He was like a ghost wandering around the arena, constantly drawing points. Except for the dozens of proving godly warriors who Luo Zheng had defeated, no one else knew him.</p>

  <p>Among all the proving godly warriors, Aleyna was only second to Donovan, the little talent of the Jiang Clan. And yet, she hadn't been able to defeat Keenan.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap between the strengths of a world lord and a True God, which one couldn't cross by relying merely on their talent. After all, the energy released by a True God's momentum was much more than ordinary life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had deftly combined six Godly Ways and attacked Keenan.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to do this. With careful design, diverse Godly Ways would often have miraculous effects. But this move was as opportunistic as juggling, and was widely considered a low trick.</p>

  <p>However, no one had thought that the kid could be so fast and suddenly burst out such unimaginable strength; the way he had defeated Keenan was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>It was normal for a low-rank True God to challenge or even defeat a mid-rank True God. But it was extremely rare for a proving godly warrior to defeat a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Liusu's attractive eyes glinted with mirth.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical disguise was pretty effective, but he couldn't mask his character. She had never even imagined that Luo Zheng would quietly appear on Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Just as I said, he is stronger than the guy you mentioned," Kelsey said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"No, he isn't," Aleyna snapped.</p>

  <p>"Now that Tianxing has arrived at the Floating Island, I'll ask Father to transfer him from the Purple Soul Hall tomorrow," Kelsey added.</p>

  <p>"Such a talent should be used by our clan, but I'm afraid he's in great trouble now," Aleyna said, a worried frown now marring her brow.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had beaten Keenan for them, their enemies would not let him go.</p>

  <p>Keenan lay on the ground, but no one went to help him. Everyone's attention was focused on Luo Zheng. Soon, a young man with long hair walked out of the crowd. A small gem-like mark decorated his forehead, a faint red light flickering around it. He glanced at Luo Zheng and said, "A strong warrior like you hasn't yet appeared on the rankings. I wonder how the Han Clan could let that happen. What's your name?"</p>

  <p>This young man was also a low-rank True God, but he showed a stronger momentum and was apparently more powerful than Keenan.</p>

  <p>Everyone present thought that Luo Zheng was a member of the Han Clan, and a talent cultivated secretly in the clan.</p>

  <p>"I'm Tianxing Luo," Luo Zheng replied calmly. He was only pretending to be calm, but from within, was feeling a crushing sense of helplessness. He knew it was difficult to get away from these guys. All he could do was hope that the elders of the Han Clan appeared as soon as possible, or there would be real trouble for him this time.</p>

  <p>There were other luck factors that contributed to his success in defeating Keenan. And while Keenan was one of the most outstanding low-rank True Gods, he was definitely not the strongest. If the guy standing before Luo Zheng was to challenge him, Luo Zheng was not sure he could win. What was more, there were also mid-rank True Gods and top-rank True Gods in this group.</p>

  <p>"Your surname is Luo, not Han?" the young man said, surprised.</p>

  <p>Everyone else mirrored his expression.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you are just a lowly outsider," someone in the crowd laughed.</p>

  <p>"But the Han Clan seems to have found a treasure. It has been many years since a proving godly warrior rivaled a True God," someone else said.</p>

  <p>"He was lucky to defeat Keenan, and Keenan didn't activate his supreme chaotic weapon. He was tricked by the kid and fought with only his physical strength!"</p>

  <p>The most glorious thing for the warriors from the wealthy clans was their family names.</p>

  <p>The surnames that had appeared above the Time Sea all belonged to legendary clans. They were also masters of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>As for the outer disciples, it didn't matter if they came from a second tier or a third tier clan. They were not qualified to be on equal footing with these rich people.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful they were, they would still be considered lowly.</p>

  <p>After all, there was neither a big clan behind them, nor were they backed by a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Which was why rich people became ruder when they talked about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The long-haired young man grinned, his eyes gleaming fiercely. "It's not easy for an outsider to cultivate to this level. But you've hurt Keenan badly. Your life has come to an end!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sheridan is angry!"</p>

  <p>"Both the Liu Clan and the Xie Clan are the weakest above the Time Sea. They have always been on good terms, and Keenan is Sheridan's good friend."</p>

  <p>"What if Sheridan kills that guy in a fit of rage?"</p>

  <p>"He is just an outsider. Even if he is talented, the Han Clan won't look into it."</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were from the Han Clan, they wouldn't dare do anything to him.</p>

  <p>They would only teach him a lesson.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't. Things were different to outsiders.</p>

  <p>Although outsiders could enter the Floating Islands through great efforts, there wouldn't be much of a difference in their status. They would meet double standards on many levels.</p>

  <p>The moment Sheridan Xie finished his sentence, he lunged at Luo Zheng. He was ranked 40th among the low-rank True Gods and was much more powerful than Keenan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already been on the alert. So when he sensed Sheridan Xie's movement, he retreated quickly, stepping out of his foe's way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was so fast no one among the proving godly warriors could parallel him.</p>

  <p>Sheridan Xie smiled coldly and said, "Running away?"</p>

  <p>The red in the gem mark on his forehead flashed and enveloped him in its shadow. While he chased Luo Zheng, he dragged out a number of figures sheathed in red behind him so that it looked like a large group of people was chasing after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And it seemed that he was even faster than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No sooner had Luo Zheng retreated eighty feet than Sheridan Xie appeared before him and blocked his path. He placed two of his slender fingers on his forehead and touched the blood red mark.</p>

  <p>A ray of blood light flashed from the gem mark on his forehead and gathered on his fingertips.</p>

  <p>A metallic sound resonated from his fingertips, his bloody fingers seeming to have turned into two sharp swords.</p>

  <p>He flipped his right hand and pointed two fingers at Luo Zheng, his eyes blazing. Killing an outsider wouldn't give him any sense of achievement.</p>

  <p>But it would be a great shame for Keenan to lose to this guy, which was why he had decided to help Keenan.</p>

  <p>At the receiving end of Sheridan Xie's attack, Luo Zheng felt cornered.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>A puff of white smoke rose from the surface of his body, and his entire body had now become light as paper.</p>

  <p>Two rays of sword radiance spurted out of Sheridan Xie's fingertips. Luo Zheng floated around as if he couldn't feel gravity.</p>

  <p>"It is really him!"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu looked relieved.</p>

  <p>She had seen Luo Zheng perform the Eight Smoky Melodies. And now, due to Sheridan Xie's force, Luo Zheng used this move to keep his life, which confirmed her conjecture.</p>

  <p>She was anxious too. She couldn't bear to see Luo Zheng killed by these people.</p>

  <p>Although she was blocked by Langston, she smiled and sent a voice message to Grant.</p>
