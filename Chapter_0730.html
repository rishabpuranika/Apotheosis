  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Eden was a divine-level talent, he had only managed to comprehend two types of Law Power. What was more, he had grasped about 80% of each Law.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had mastered three types of Law Power. What was more shocking was that he had fully comprehended all three Law Powers!</p>

  <p>Cultivators had their own merits and shortcomings. For instance, some were good at Wind Law, although they were terrible at Fire Law. In common cases, a martial artist would only be able to comprehend one type of Law Power.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, no more than twenty geniuses had managed to learn two Law Powers.</p>

  <p>That was why the cultivators in the audience were so astonished when Eden displayed knowledge of two types of Law Power. They all marveled at his remarkable talent for he could practice Wind Law and Metal Law simultaneously.</p>

  <p>But to their surprise, Luo Luo Zheng had also mastered the two Law Powers he had displayed? Wind Law and Metal Law.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Luo Zheng had used Fire Law, which allowed the crowd to think that he mainly practiced refinement technique of the fire attribute. But now, it turned out that he had learned another two Law Powers, and all the cultivators present found this hard to believe.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he had a great harvest at the Dragon Soar Arena," Dillon guessed, observing the Law Power Luo Luo Zheng had released.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you. I figured this kid must have been lucky enough to find the complete Law Power in the Dragon Soar Arena. After all, there is no complete Law Power in the Central Region. But it is not an easy task to head for the Upper World and comprehend three types of Law Power. This brat possesses outstanding talent," Haber Mo who had been silent all this time responded flatly.</p>

  <p>From the three leaders, Dillon was shrewd and sophisticated, while Hobbes was short tempered. Haber was taciturn. But now, Haber, who was known as, The Silent Man, voiced his opinion. It was said that he could stay silent for as long as ten months.</p>

  <p>After Haber finished his sentence, the three looked toward the Dragon Soar Arena that stood not far from them. They all were curious about Luo Zheng's experience in the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon took credit for Luo Zheng's trip to the Upper World. And he could master nine laws thanks to the baptism by laws, which made Luo Luo Zheng fit for all kinds of law refinement.</p>

  <p>Without receiving the baptism by laws, the divine-level talents in the Central Region could only learn two or three rules. That was why the Dragon Abyss Palace valued Luo Luo Zheng so much!</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Luo Zheng, Xiao gently shook his head and puzzlement reflected in his eyes. "This kid possesses knowledge of four laws, not three," he muttered.</p>

  <p>When he presided over the pre-qualifying match, he had seen Luo Luo Zheng exhibit powerful lightning skills.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't paid much attention to Luo Luo Zheng then. Also, as the lightning Luo Luo Zheng had released had disappeared immediately, Xiao didn't have the time to figure out how much Law Power was inside the lightning. But considering the lightning changed the magnetic stone's color and it lasted for five minutes, he inferred that Luo Luo Zheng had fully mastered the first layer of Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>'Four Law Powers. Did this brat comprehend all of them?' Xiao wondered with a frown.</p>

  <p>With the Nameless Saber in his hand, Eden narrowed his eyes at the golden wind blades surrounding Luo Zheng's body. A trace of excitement appeared in his eyes. "I see. It looks like I underestimated you. This is your real strength!"</p>

  <p>Eden said before breaking into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish..."</p>

  <p>Eden lightly waved his Nameless Saber, which seemed to be powerful enough to tear anything in the world. With a snort, he said defiantly, "You think you can defeat me because you mastered those rules. You are too naive!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's Nameless Saber was a puzzle. He had killed countless people with this saber, yet no one knew anything about it.</p>

  <p>"Then, I'll show you the terrifying power of the sacred weapon!" As the light curtain dissipated, Eden pointed his saber straight at Luo Luo Zheng. "Although you have learned many rules, you still can't defeat me because my cultivation level is higher than yours."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished talking, Eden slid his saber horizontally in front of his chest, and it shone. In the next second, he vanished in the wind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment Eden had disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng became alert and drew his sword out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>It was a three-foot-long plain iron sword. It was devoid of special patterns, and it didn't glow with a bright light.</p>

  <p>Calmly, Luo Luo Zheng swung it above his head.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The sound of a collision between iron and gold rang out.</p>

  <p>After withstanding his opponent's attack, Luo Luo Zheng thrust his sword at the spot in the air and another loud sound echoed through the arena.</p>

  <p>He then pointed his sword to his left front and cut horizontally. "Dang!"</p>

  <p>A figure appeared from the wind. Eden took a step back. His face deathly pale, Eden held on to his Nameless Saber as he gazed at the iron sword in Luo Zheng's hand with his piercing eyes. He asked, "Your sword is also a sacred weapon, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his sword and countered with a smile, "What do you think? I already told you that your crown is cheap."</p>

  <p>Eden initially planned to bring Luo Luo Zheng down with his Nameless Saber, which was a sacred weapon for he didn't think Luo Luo Zheng would be able to defend against it.</p>

  <p>But to Eden's astonishment, Luo Luo Zheng took out a sacred weapon and effortlessly defended against his three strikes especially when he had taken the initiative to attack while hiding in the wind.</p>

  <p>"How did you locate me?" Eden asked. He had learned the technique that made him invisible. People weren't supposed to be able to see him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had withstood his blows and located his position.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would never let Eden know that his soul was much stronger than his because it had reached the Fighting Soul Realm. And that was why he had easily located Eden. With a faint smile, he replied, "The wind exposed your location."</p>

  <p>While the two contestants talked with each other, the martial artists on the high platform threw themselves into heated discussions again.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that? In the blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng took out a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>More importantly, it is a sword!"</p>

  <p>"Many sects don't have a sacred weapon yet. But this brat not only has a sacred-level protective garment, he also has a sacred-level sword! Did he raid some divine kingdom's treasury?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows. Anyway, I want to rob him. He must have many treasures. If I can get them, I can be the best martial artist in the Central Region."</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? Don't flatter yourself. Though he is a cultivator of the Illuminating Soul Realm and you are at the Internal Elixir Realm, do you think you stand a chance against him in a fight? Besides, he is a disciple of Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Eden's face darkened. But soon, a smile danced on the corner of his lips.</p>

  <p>'He surprised me. Looks like he is a difficult opponent, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Eden thought this Martial Arts Contest would be boring.</p>

  <p>He believed that Brent of Ethereal Spirit Sect would be his only worthy opponent as Brent was also a divine-level talent like him. But now, he met Luo Luo Zheng. He had become excited and more serious about this fight.</p>

  <p>"I'm ashamed of myself because I'm going to fight you more seriously. But I admit that you're strong."</p>

  <p>With a smile, Eden swept his finger across the edge of his Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>The blade of the saber was immediately stained with blood.</p>

  <p>On the high platform, Eddie, who was sitting on the chair, suddenly stood up and shouted, "Eden!"</p>

  <p>Eden gave his father a small smile and responded, "Father, I know what I'm doing."</p>

  <p>Eddie furrowed his brows and slowly sat back in his seat. He didn't think his son had to activate the power of Nameless Saber to deal with Luo Luo Zheng, who was not a formidable opponent for Eden.</p>

  <p>However, Eden thought differently. He meant to go all out to make sure that he could end Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>"Buzzzzz?"</p>

  <p>When Eden's blood flowed into the patterns along the edge, his saber gave off a strong killing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The blood ran through the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>After the blood circulated the saber, it dripped onto the ground. But the strange thing was, it didn't seep into the cracks in the field.</p>

  <p>The drops of blood crawled on the ground as if they were living creatures, and they eventually flew together and formed a rune.</p>

  <p>Before long, a hand emerged from the rune, followed by shoulders, head, upper body, and legs.</p>

  <p>A monster of blood had been conjured in front of everyone. With a hunch, it had two horns on its head and a tail that looked as sharp as a saber on its back. It stood still, emitting an infinite evil air.</p>

  <p>"It is Netherworld Yaksha. It lives in the river in hell!"</p>
