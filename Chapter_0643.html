<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 643 The Golden Opportunity (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Though the cyan dragon could be irritating at times, Luo Zheng knew that he had a broader horizon at the world. It was one thing that Luo Zheng admired from the cyan dragon. Everything that Luo Zheng valued the most was nothing in the eyes of the cyan dragon. This included the Perfect Brushwork, the consummate sword intent, and all the treasures that Luo Zheng acquired through a great deal of effort.</p>

  <p>So, if the cyan dragon said that it was his golden opportunity, then Luo Zheng could not argue with that.</p>

  <p>"As I said, this is your golden opportunity. But of course, you will need my help! Don't think of running away. Just bear with it a little longer. If he can really find that place, with my help, you can reach the level of Illuminating Soul Realm instantly!" The cyan dragon said. After a pause, he continued, "I think I know what he is looking for."</p>

  <p>'Reach the level of Illuminating Soul Realm!' Luo Zheng got lost upon hearing these words. He didn't seem to have heard what the cyan dragon was saying. He was now more curious about what could happen and the purpose of the young man in purple for leading all of them to the Moon Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng originally thought that they would be used as baits in the Moon Mountain. But contrary to what he initially believed would happen, two of the masters of Internal Elixir Realm looked for the way themselves and killed all the beasts they encountered so all their captives wouldn't be hurt.</p>

  <p>The beasts in Moon Mountain could be cruel and strong, but the power of the masters of Internal Elixir Realm was far greater. Hence, killing beasts was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>The young man in purple would occasionally take out the dragon jade pendant to determine the way they needed to go. Afterward, he would ask the troop to follow him. But as they moved farther, it became clear that their destination wasn't the top of the Moon Mountain. They were being led to somewhere else.</p>

  <p>"Hey, cyan dragon, do you know where he's taking us? Please tell me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon again. He was growing more impatient since all his calculations were wrong from the start. If the cyan dragon hadn't appeared, he would have decided to escape and wouldn't know what the man in purple was up to.</p>

  <p>But the cyan dragon didn't say a word. He just smiled and then added,</p>

  <p>"You'll know once we get there. If you can make it there alive, I will help you reach the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. And there can be more benefits that you can ever imagine!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sensed that the cyan dragon wouldn't give him more details even if he asked. So, to save him from getting more annoyed, Luo Zheng stopped asking. But he knew that the cyan dragon and the other "things" inside his body wouldn't surely do something harmful to him.</p>

  <p>Another half an hour of walking had passed. As they were all taking the twisty mountain road, a sunken mountain creek suddenly emerged with a fancy tower magically glittering in the middle of it.</p>

  <p>The tower was about 100 feet high, full of strange lights, with a huge monster sitting on top of it. There was no mistaking, and it–it was a winged dragon!</p>

  <p>The winged dragon with an embossed forehead twined on the tower. Its sharp teeth were showing as it waved its claws.</p>

  <p>"I found you at last!! You may look like a purple thunder bamboo from the sky, but you aren't. You are Dragon Soar Arena! Now, I will have all my dreams come true! Ha ha ha!" The young man in purple laughed crazily. His eyes were glistering in a strange way.</p>

  <p>The three masters of Internal Elixir were happy to have reached the conclusion of their journey and tried to flatter their lord,</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! My lord, you finally found the Dragon Soar Arena!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the young man's laughter, the winged dragon stretched its neck and roared at the troop.</p>

  <p>"Roaaar!"</p>

  <p>It was so loud that all the practitioners of nature level were frightened. In fear, they all knelt down and covered their heads with their arms.</p>

  <p>"Go and take everyone there! It's time to feed the dragon!" The young man in purple said as he waved his hand. He seemed to be delighted at the sight of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>The practitioners guarding the troop started driving the troop by waving their whips. They yelled at the captured practitioners; however, no one moved. Even Luo Zheng didn't dare to take a step.</p>

  <p>In the minds of each captured practitioner, they would eventually die no matter what they chose. But they wouldn't willingly obey the last order and be eaten by that dragon.</p>

  <p>Some of the captured practitioners were enraged and started cursing,</p>

  <p>"You're all fucking cowards! You won't make us kill ourselves! I would rather die here than be eaten by that monster!"</p>

  <p>"I would rather die than help you in your purpose!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the commotion, the two masters on the primary level of Internal Elixir rushed to the troop. They caught several practitioners and forcefully threw them into the mountain creek. The practitioners rolled down the creek like rocks, but before even hitting the ground, they were bitten and swallowed by the winged dragon. It happened so fast that those eaten didn't have the chance to scream for their lives.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate fate that those practitioners met had frightened the rest.</p>

  <p>They initially thought the winged dragon wouldn't eat people. But upon seeing it with their own eyes, they became helpless.</p>

  <p>The captured practitioners of nature level were thrown to the mountain creek one by one. The rest could not do anything but wait for their own fate. The two masters on the primary level of Internal Elixir kept on throwing the practitioners into the creek, while the ferocious winged dragon ate all them all without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Now, there were only eight practitioners that stood in front of Luo Zheng. It would eventually be his turn. He grew anxious and could not think straight. Finally, he asked the cyan dragon, "Now, tell me what to do! I believe you won't let me be eaten by that dragon!"</p>
