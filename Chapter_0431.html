  <p>Basic swordsmanship?</p>

  <p>The crowd at the current match in Cloud Sect was rendered speechless by what they just saw. Never was such a basic technique used against a powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>There was only one person who was somewhat glad in the sea of astonished people--it was Zachary, from the Ninety-foot Peak.</p>

  <p>He had already seen what Luo Zheng's excellent basic swordsmanship was capable of, so he understood why the people were shocked by what he did.</p>

  <p>'Maybe Luo Zheng's skill just shook them to death!' he thought. Back when Zachary first saw Luo Luo Zheng use the basic swordsmanship on the Seven Star Sword Light Platform, he wasn't faced with a tougher opponent.</p>

  <p>However, now that he was fighting a much stronger foe--he still used the basic swordsmanship! Because of that, Zachary believed that the people were more surprised or even uneasier than he was at that time.</p>

  <p>The basic swordsmanship was the first set of sword techniques that most martial artists came across. There were also other kinds of primary techniques such as the basic spearsmanship, basic fist position, and so on.</p>

  <p>In general, an aspiring martial artist would master the whole set of the basic swordsmanship in his childhood, then practice the other kinds of swordsmanship later on using the basic set as the foundation.</p>

  <p>The basic swordsmanship was quite simple, so it was hard to fight powerful enemies with it because it lacked advanced tactics and power.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one would use this kind of swordsmanship in such a grueling fight.</p>

  <p>It was like using a one-plus-one algorithm to solve complex math problems--so one could imagine just how strenuous that was!</p>

  <p>"Has Luo Luo Zheng turned into a complete fool?"</p>

  <p>"How could he use the basic swordsmanship with a fairy weapon? Does he think this battle with Tracy is a joke?"</p>

  <p>"Fighting with the basic swordsmanship in the All Peaks Competition of Cloud Sect? That has never happened before, but now it just might make it into history, since the founding of Cloud Sect!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know what to say. Perhaps it means that Luo Luo Zheng has given up, and the basic swordsmanship is only a symbolic resistance?"</p>

  <p>Among the surprised spectators, Sheeny and Wing conversed animatedly about Luo Luo Zheng. Sheeny watched the competition from outside the battlefield, while Wing sat on the ground and healed his wound.</p>

  <p>Sheeny licked his lips and continued to watch. "What's Luo Luo Zheng doing?</p>

  <p>Would he really use basic swordsmanship against Tracy, who has activated the body of the Blue Phoenix?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming's brows furrowed slightly as he watched the fight.</p>

  <p>With his impressive insight into swordsmanship and sword intent, he noticed that something was wrong with Luo Zheng's use of the basic swordsmanship. It was indeed the same technique, but there was also something different about it when viewed from Luo Zheng's perspective. It felt strange, but Tianming couldn't put it into words. He just instinctively felt that Luo Zheng's swordsmanship wasn't as simple as they thought. "Maybe Luo Zheng's basic swordsmanship only looks like the actual basic swordsmanship?" he said.</p>

  <p>"You must be kidding, Tianming. The basic swordsmanship is the foundation of all the swordsmanships. After countless generations of practice, it has been extremely streamlined, so it's impossible to make any changes to it at all. You might know that better than I do," Sheeny replied with a smile. He also used the same weapon, but his Reaching Sun Sword was particular about the sword power. He hadn't understood the concept of sword intent yet.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Tianming answered and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I just have some doubts about that," he added.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, Luo Luo Zheng finally made a move.</p>

  <p>"Chop!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>His attack was just a simple move with moderate speed, and it wasn't really what one would call outstanding.</p>

  <p>However, right after Luo Luo Zheng had finished cutting with the sword, Tianming suddenly stiffened in shock.</p>

  <p>"The chop seems to be?"</p>

  <p>He was now at a loss for words. His eyes gawked at Luo Luo Zheng as if he was an incredible monster. It seemed that no one else could impress Tianming with the use of basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Sheeny's eyes widened in astonishment as well. He couldn't say a word and was in a daze for a while, "Monster?" he blurted.</p>

  <p>Although what Luo Luo Zheng had done was just a simple move, he had practiced and simplified it in his mind numerous times.</p>

  <p>It was easy to turn a simple thing into something complicated, but to make a complicated thing simple was another story.</p>

  <p>The basic swordsmanship was a kind of swordsmanship which had already been simplified for thousands of years by countless generations.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had simplified it once again many times.</p>

  <p>The greatest truths were the simplest, and true enlightenment was in nature itself!</p>

  <p>It was safe to assume that Luo Zheng's basic swordsmanship was no longer the original one, but a new set that he created and belonged only to himself!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tracy, who was currently in the closest range to Luo Luo Zheng, felt a strong sense of threat.</p>

  <p>She knew it was a simple move of chop, but she was also aware that its strength wasn't as simple as it looked. There seemed to be many hidden mysteries in Luo Zheng's version of the move with the sword.</p>

  <p>"It's amazing that you have such special swordsmanship, but you are still no match for me if you only have the sword!" Tracy declared.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the Blue Phoenix behind her suddenly radiated a bright beam of light, and the life vitality in her hands gradually increased.</p>

  <p>"The claw of the Blue Phoenix!" Tracy shouted.</p>

  <p>After that, she bent her fingers and formed several sharp blue nails using the mix of blue light and life vitality, then immediately tried to claw Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Five blue claw imprints, each containing the ferocious strength of the Blue Phoenix, appeared in the air after Tracy tried to tear Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Blue Phoenix was one of the legendary beasts. Even though there was just a small part of the Blue Phoenix's blood in Tracy's body, she was still a terrifying force to reckon.</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples in Cloud Sect thought that Luo Luo Zheng might win the competition with his rare move of chop, but when they felt the immense strength of the Blue Phoenix in Tracy's body, they changed their minds.</p>
