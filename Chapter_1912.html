<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was the second time around that Kaydan, Chapman, and some of others had entered this cave.</p>

  <p>But sadly, up to this moment, these six great races hadn't made much progress in their quest and exploration of the interior world.</p>

  <p>For example, in a place like the Soul Suppressing Cliff, they all knew that one would need a black trial tally for them to gain entry. But obtaining a black trial tally would never be easy.</p>

  <p>The accumulated purple trial tallies of the six races were as huge as a big mountain. Chapman and Kaydan had once conveyed with their prophets, as to whether or not they would be permitted to use purple trial tallies in exchange for the black trial tally. However, they failed to receive an affirmative response, as the answer they got was a big no.</p>

  <p>These places were not even prepared for the natives. Those prophets were the incarnations of Holy Jay. How could Holy Jay allow them to enter these places?</p>

  <p>Though they felt helpless, the six races could only continue to explore the interior world, until they finally spotted this strange cave.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the natural chamber of this cave, they eventually found some clue. What was striking was the dark green flame filling up the entire cave. It held a strength that was so powerful, a mysterious force akin to something they could not easily defeat.</p>

  <p>By this time, Kaydan and Chapman both were seriously mulling over.</p>

  <p>They thought of figuring out ways on how to deal with this green flame.</p>

  <p>But in the end, they were all disappointed and left with no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>They noted that anything thrown in would be melted by the green flame, leaving no trace at all. Even a small piece of the Magic Golden Stone would be quickly melted into a golden liquid the moment it came into contact with the green flame.</p>

  <p>With the existence of this kind of flame, it only denoted that no one was welcome to enter.</p>

  <p>Kaydan was silently not willing to accept this loss. Before he left, he had used the Eye of Void, which was taught to the Skyland race by martial artists from the divine land, and that was to use life vitality to visualize the Eye of Void. Through this Eye of Void, they would be able to see the scene inside the cave.</p>

  <p>The shape of the Eye of Void was very special. Other than it was formed from life vitality, it also needed to be fused with the Space Law.</p>

  <p>This eye was traveling at the front and back of the space, shuttling back and forth, so it could avoid the green flame in the cave to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>Even the Eye of Void was only able to last half a minute in this green flame. Beyond that, it could no longer resist the scorching heat of the green flame. And for another three seconds longer, it would turn into pieces.</p>

  <p>The natives would simply tend to give up if they didn't see anything helpful in the cave.</p>

  <p>They would not try to deal with the dangerous green flame for nothing.</p>

  <p>Even though they were natives of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, it did not mean that they were invincible in this place. There were some things that they could not afford to provoke, such as the Martial Sacred Beast and the green flame in the cave.</p>

  <p>It was just that the last scene that was transmitted to them by the Eye of Void was something they would never forget, thus making them more determined to enter this cave.</p>

  <p>They happened to view a door in the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>There was a single door in the depths of the cave. Even though the surroundings were filled with the green flame, the door remained to be intact.</p>

  <p>If they had seen something else other than the door, perhaps it wouldn't pique their interest. For example, if they saw a savage beast that wasn't afraid of the green flame, some weapon or even the best cultivation method, this wouldn't be very attractive to the six great races.</p>

  <p>But luck was on their side when they happened to catch a glimpse of the door.</p>

  <p>Numerous martial artists coming from different universes had made their presence known after the opening of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. A majority of martial artists from the divine land also came. Those martial artists indeed made it possible for six great races to learn about the outside world consistently.</p>

  <p>They were mostly like some innocent children who had just opened their eyes, realizing overnight that the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a small and cramped world. It turned out that the outside world was unexpectedly so vast.</p>

  <p>The basic instinct of life was urging them to find a way out.</p>

  <p>But after searching the entire Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they found out that only those warriors from outside could enter and leave this place as they pleased, while it was almost impossible for the natives to leave and gain entry to the divine land.</p>

  <p>According to some foreign martial artists, to leave the universe, one had to become a True God. Otherwise, they would be turned into life vitality.</p>

  <p>Even so, no one in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land chose to give up. And that single door provided them endless illusions and lots of possibilities.</p>

  <p>What was behind that door? Was it a path to the divine land?</p>

  <p>But the green flame was fiercely blocking their way. It wasn't until Luo Zheng appeared in the Collapsing Mountain race that Chapman's heart was set ablaze with hope. And that he eagerly contacted the Skyland race and the Harmony race to plan this operation.</p>

  <p>A few moments passed, and everyone felt waves of scorching heat blowing towards them after successfully entering through the cave on the cliff.</p>

  <p>The interior of the cave was extremely smooth, and there was only a narrow path in the middle that would only fit two people. And on both sides of the road, surging lava could be seen.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the lava here was not the usual scarlet red, but deep green in hue. As the lava surged, it would occasionally transform into various strange shapes that emitted a scorching Mu Ning, and at the same time, an intense Life Law.</p>

  <p>The fire was often the nemesis of living beings, and any casual contact with it would bring about a devastating disaster. But in this green lava, it gave people a sense of vitality. The combination of the two opposite feelings made people feel very strange. Besides the strangeness, there was also a sense of vigilance in people's minds.</p>

  <p>"We have yet to explore this place thoroughly. Everyone, please be careful," Kaydan warned.</p>

  <p>But everyone was already on their guard even without Kaydan's warning.</p>

  <p>However, some of the foreign martial artists regretted their decision to explore the interior world.</p>

  <p>The interior world and the exterior world had almost the same size.</p>

  <p>Some seniors said that the former was filled with so many treasures, and that Holy Jay had placed many of his treasures into the interior world In the past, many foreign warriors had benefited a lot from it. Some of them even took away one of the core treasures of Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible for such a thing to happen in the universes created by other Holy Beings. Therefore, when the news spread out, it attracted the warriors of the divine land to come and explore. After all, Holy Jay was way too generous!</p>

  <p>But up until now, they had not found any opportunities. Instead, soon after they penetrated the interior world, they had encountered a lot of danger.</p>

  <p>How many would be willing to take such a risk if the risks and rewards were not rated proportionally?</p>

  <p>However, since they had already reached this step, they had no other option to take.</p>

  <p>Among these people, Luo Zheng was the most relaxed. After he had come into contact with Holy Jay, this exploration was akin to revealing the answer to the riddle that puzzled him for quite some time now. He was not even surprised to find Holy Jay's attention on him.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng still hadn't understood why Holy Jay was being so nice to him as he had brought him here to help him refine his body.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>As they followed the narrow route, green bubbles started to appear in the lava from both sides of the path.</p>

  <p>Then the green lava suddenly turned into horses, swiftly galloping towards the group of people.</p>

  <p>"Be careful." Kaydan's alert eyes squinted, and an azure-colored scroll appeared in his hands.</p>

  <p>The corners of Liusu's lips curled up slightly when she saw the scroll.</p>

  <p>"It's the Ice Butterfly Picture!"</p>

  <p>"It is indeed our family's Ice Butterfly Picture. I wonder how it will end up in the hands of the Skyland race." Kennan nodded.</p>

  <p>The Ice Butterfly Picture could be considered an all-powerful ice-attribute treasure in the Han Clan. The Ice Butterfly Picture might have been passed down from the Han Clan to the other people in the divine land, and then the Skyland race got it. Or it could also be the Han Clan who gave it to the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The three races paid much attention to the trip and made preparations for it in advance. They had many other methods hidden away to deal with the unexpected. However, after passing through the black ball, they were directly teleported to their destination by Holy Jay, which saved them a lot of trouble, and naturally, they did not use any of those methods.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when they saw this cave, Kaydan and the rest were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The moment Kaydan took out the Ice Butterfly Picture, the heat was already cooled down to some extent. In this cave filled with green lava, it was as if everyone was falling into a land of frost. An illusory chill spread out, and ice and snow flew about, instantly enveloping everyone within.</p>

  <p>And when the horses made of green lava rushed over and did not even get close to the group of people, a group of ice butterflies that were as clean as snow danced and flew towards them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ice butterflies came into contact with the horses, they were instantly melted into ashes. However, every single ice butterfly was able to emit a large amount of chilliness. And as the countless ice butterflies flew over, they continuously melted helplessly. The horses formed from the green lava also quickly disintegrated, turning into a pile of dark green stones that fell back into the lava.</p>

  <p>At this moment, deep within the cave, an old man dressed in black armor held a golden hammer in his hand. His one remaining eye was wide open as he silently watched Luo Zheng, who was among them. He clicked his tongue twice and extended his snake-like tongue to lick the tip of his nose. "Jay didn't lie to me. There is such a unique raw material in this world. How interesting!"</p>
