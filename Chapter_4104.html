<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization couldn't decipher the Sanskrit words on the seventeenth stone tablet, they had no choice but to leave it to the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>Although there was little hope, Zheng still decided to take the stone tablet to them to ask.</p>

  <p>Upon receiving the stone tablet from Zheng, Tearrag didn't show any impatience. He looked it over for a bit before declaring, "These are not Sanskrit words."</p>

  <p>"Not Sanskrit words?" Zheng echoed, raising his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the records on the stone tablets Zheng read were all written in Sanskrit. Could there possibly be another language in the Four Spirits Sect?</p>

  <p>Tearrag held up the stone tablet. "It's a Blood-controlling Method," he said. "Look at these curved lines. Don't you think they look like a monkey?"</p>

  <p>Zheng, the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess all turned their gazes to the stone tablet to study it once more.</p>

  <p>Now that Tearrag pointed it out, they could vaguely make out a figure.</p>

  <p>Although these lines were messy, they were actually very similar to the meridians in one's body.</p>

  <p>"I think it looks more like a human..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but speak up.</p>

  <p>"Monkey!" Tearrag snapped decisively, casting him a glare.</p>

  <p>One of the reasons why the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect were very close to each other was that their bodies were similar in form.</p>

  <p>Thus, if the human spirits could use the methods created by Kincaid, the monkey spirits wouldn't have any problem performing the same.</p>

  <p>However, it was a different story for the bird and snake spirits.</p>

  <p>"How does one use this Blood-controlling Method?" Zheng cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Just operate according to the meridians on the pattern. These four pictures are four small circulations, and they form one big circulation..."</p>

  <p>As Tearrag spoke, his fingers were tracing the lines on the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his expression changed. "This operation method is so strange.</p>

  <p>Does this really have anything to do with the ancestry-level bloodline?"</p>

  <p>In fact, the Blood-controlling Method created by Kincaid was no secret in the Four Spirits Sect. However, the Monkey Masters had no interest in matters outside their sect. While they had great talent in cultivation, they only really cared about the methods they could make use of.</p>

  <p>If one couldn't merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, the Blood-controlling Method was deemed useless to them, so the Monkey Masters didn't concern themselves with it.</p>

  <p>However, what appeared to be a useless waste to the Monkey Masters turned out to be extremely important to Zheng. Talk about one man's trash being another one's treasure!</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess suddenly spoke up. "Back then, when no one could absorb the ancestry-level bloodline, what was the point of creating this Blood-controlling Method?"</p>

  <p>"Puppets," Tearrag answered gravely. "I remember, some people from the Human Spirit Sect had asked us to collect all kinds of materials to make puppets. The Blood-controlling Method wasn't used on living beings.</p>

  <p>They wanted to use it on puppets." His eyes narrowed. "But it should have failed..."</p>

  <p>At that time, the Human Spirit Sect had used all the methods they could think of.</p>

  <p>However, puppets weren't living things, after all. So the Blood-controlling Method didn't work on them.</p>

  <p>As Tearrag trailed off, he shifted his gaze towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>He suddenly clapped his hands and said excitedly, "Since this Blood-controlling Method didn't work on puppets, how about we try using it on you?"</p>

  <p>Actually, this thought had crossed the minds of Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess earlier.</p>

  <p>"I'll try it now..." Zheng said decidedly.</p>

  <p>Previously, all the miracles that happened to Zheng's body were thanks to the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, the ancestry-level bloodline was not under Zheng's control, and sometimes, it had a mind of its own. If this Blood-controlling Method actually worked, then Zheng could say he stumbled upon the jackpot of methods!</p>

  <p>Tearrag didn't try to stop Zheng. In fact, the Monkey Spirit King was hoping Zheng would find a solution here.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to concentrate. Then, an invisible force lifted the stone tablet and it floated in front of him.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had tried various ways to control the ancestry-level bloodline, but none of them worked. After so many failed attempts, he didn't know what to expect this time.</p>

  <p>Zheng shoved his doubts to the back of his mind as he envisioned the pattern of meridians in the first small circulation.</p>

  <p>The pattern started from the right shoulder and terminated in the left leg.</p>

  <p>Once he could clearly picture the pattern of meridians, he manipulated his blood to flow along the pattern.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, this time, the originally uncontrollable ancestry-level bloodline followed meekly. The ancestry-level bloodline was like a docile kitten as it flowed in the direction that Zheng guided.</p>

  <p>Even the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Snake Goddess, and Tearrag, who were not far away, sensed that something was out of the norm.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline might be gentle and obedient now, but they all knew that things could change in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>This pattern was very complicated, and the lines contained rules that Zheng found difficult to read.</p>

  <p>As he guided his blood, Zheng quietly marveled at the intricacy of the pattern.</p>

  <p>If it was his own bloodline, he would be able to explore it bit by bit as he slowly took control of it. And it would not be surprising that he would finally master the Blood-controlling Method.</p>

  <p>However, Kincaid had never absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline. Zheng didn't know how he had drawn these lines. What kind of talent it required to enable him to complete such work?</p>

  <p>About a quarter of an hour later, Zheng carefully neared finishing the first small circulation.</p>

  <p>The moment he completed it, he suddenly felt a chill rushing up from his meridians.</p>

  <p>Frowning, he then felt something stirring in his mind.</p>

  <p>That thing was a square, with a simple rune wrapped in the middle. The rune was in the form of a ring hidden in the middle of a triangle.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>It didn't look like Sanskrit, neither did it look like it was in any language he knew.</p>

  <p>So far, it seemed as though Zheng had never come across such a rune before.</p>

  <p>"The second small circulation begins..."</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to shrug it off and proceeded to cultivate the second small circulation.</p>

  <p>Another quarter of an hour later, Zheng finished the second small circulation and another square appeared in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It was also a rune wrapped in a square, but this time, this square joined the first square, like two puzzle pieces connecting.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored this and began to cultivate the third small circulation, and then later, the fourth one.</p>

  <p>After he finished the large circulation in this Blood-controlling Method, the four squares that formed in Zheng's mind pieced together in sequence to form one large square.</p>

  <p>The four patterns in the square were also perfectly connected, like a completed puzzle!</p>

  <p>When Zheng tried to use his consciousness to explore the big square, a sense of familiarity arose, as though he somehow obtained the ability to understand the runes.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his eyes popped wide open, and his hands trembled violently.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Zheng?" the real Snake Goddess asked with concern.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven piped in.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tearrag glanced at Zheng indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was very interested in the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline, but these Monkey Masters thought differently.</p>

  <p>It was because of the ancestry-level bloodline that the Four Spirits Sect was reduced to this situation. In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, this thing was the source of their downfall, and would not bring any benefits to the Monkey Spirit Sect. Thus, they looked at it with disdain.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine..." Zheng said shakily.</p>

  <p>Wincing slightly, he opened his right hand, palm facing up.</p>

  <p>His palm began to crack, and traces of bright red blood began to fill the palm.</p>

  <p>Raising his hand gently to study it, thin blood streaks painted his palm, like an intricate coral reef.</p>

  <p>Then, a thought crossed Zheng's mind. Like lightning, the streaks of blood responded immediately. In the blink of an eye, the blood streaks moved around to form the shape of a blood sword, which was exactly what Zheng had been thinking!</p>

  <p>Because it was woven from threads of blood, the blood sword was filled with pulsating coral branches. It truly resembled an intricately-shaped coral.</p>

  <p>The moment Tearrag's eyes landed on the coral blood sword, he immediately took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters had a strong fighting instinct, and Tearrag immediately sensed that this strange blood sword was dangerous.</p>

  <p>The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess didn't budge, but they recalled to mind that time Zheng and the resentment-level Treacherous Being had fought back on the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>At the time, Zheng's body had been devoured; only coral-like streaks of blood were left of him.</p>
