<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3251 Reach An Compromise </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's thunderous voice shook the Souls of Light to the core.</p>

  <p>His words shocked everyone, especially the three old men from the Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The three did not show it but what just happened made them worry greatly.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng came here to make trouble for no reason, then they would be in great trouble. However, if he had some reason to do what he did, things would be different because that meant that they had a chance of negotiating with him.</p>

  <p>The leader of the three old men bowed respectfully to Luo Zheng. "My friend, please calm down and wait a moment. I shall go and ask the Separate Abyss race regarding this matter."</p>

  <p>With this, the eagle beneath his feet let out a shrill cry before descending towards the temple.</p>

  <p>There was a bit of a five-minute wait before the old man returned, still atop the eagle, and faced Luo Zheng. "I apologize for what the members of the Separate Abyss race did. They were the ones who broke the rules and inconvenienced you. As compensation, we will be giving you a hundred million soul pills."</p>

  <p>That amount might seem like a terrible loss at first, but they could easily earn it back. One hundred million soul pills was just the toll fee of ten thousand creatures after all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's rampage in the city cost no less than a hundred million soul pills, but it was important to placate him now, or they would risk paying a bigger price if he continued his destructive ways.</p>

  <p>What the old man was worried about was the possibility of Luo Zheng going back on his word.</p>

  <p>"Send one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal instead of one hundred million soul pills to the human race's star ring in Stage Twelve," Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>Given his reasonable demand, the three old men of the Abyss Spirit race raised no more objections against him.</p>

  <p>Once an agreement had been reached, Luo Zheng finally shrank back to his normal size.</p>

  <p>With this problem taken care of, the young man turned away to take his leave. The old man of the Abyss Spirit race, however, stopped him. "My friend..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around, an eyebrow raised in suspicion. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>The old man hesitated for a brief moment but went ahead to ask his question. "As far as I know, the body refining skill of the ancient gods has long since lost its effect and no real body could enter the Other Shore. Just how were you able to enter with that body of yours?"</p>

  <p>Truth ruled the whole chaos. It was greater than everything and the old man believed that it was also unbreakable. Luo Zheng's existence right now was an enigma. How exactly did this young man do it? The only explanation the old man could think of was that Luo Zheng surpassed the truth, but that was impossible! Surpassing the truth would mean that he was stronger than the Chaos Ancient Gods and there was no way that was the case given his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>"I... I don't know either. Even if I did, why should I tell you?" Luo Zheng answered coyly.</p>

  <p>His reply had the old man blush in embarrassment. Since the young man was unwilling to disclose his secret, then all they could really do was let him leave quietly.</p>

  <p>Numerous members of the Separate Abyss race lined the road that led out of the city. Almost all of them stared at Luo Zheng in fear as he walked past.</p>

  <p>None of them knew of the fact that they weren't the first ones to suffer his wrath. The Bearing race had previously tasted the bitter consequences of angering this human man.</p>

  <p>Outside the city, Luo Zheng stepped into the human race's star ring and immediately entered Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had been waiting for him for quite a while now. She immediately heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing him finally walk out of the star ring.</p>

  <p>Going against the Separate Abyss race was an entirely different can of worms compared to when Luo Zheng went against the Bearing race. The main reason was that the Separate Abyss race was backed by the Abyss Spirit race who were natives of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"How did it go?" Dorothy asked, hiding her worries with a nonchalant greeting.</p>

  <p>"It went fine. We should wait here for a moment," Luo Zheng told her.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smirked. "One hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal."</p>

  <p>Dorothy let out a slight gasp. "You seriously made them pay you back with one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal? And they said yes? Did you demolish their entire temple or something?"</p>

  <p>She was well aware of how arrogant and domineering the Separate Abyss race was. For Luo Zheng to have made them agree to his terms and pay him back meant he probably caused great damage to their temple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. "Kind of. We came to an agreement before I managed to destroy their temple."</p>

  <p>Dorothy was no fool. No matter how casual Luo Zheng made it out to be, she knew that he caused a great deal of devastation to the Separate Abyss race for things to have turned out this way.</p>

  <p>'It's as Grandma said. Once Luo Zheng passed the Sea of Truth in the form of his body, he can do whatever he wants on the Other Shore. He's already demolished the Bearing race's temple, and almost destroyed the Separate Abyss race's. He's truly leaving a trail of destruction in his wake, isn't he?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>The two of them waited for two more hours before a Soul of Light appeared and immediately headed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was only one corporeal body here on the Other Shore which made identifying Luo Zheng quite easy.</p>

  <p>"I've been entrusted by the Separate Abyss race to hand you the agreed settlement," the Soul of Light told Luo Zheng politely, taking out small pillars from his space ring. These were the one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng accepted these pillars and casually threw them to Dorothy. He nodded back to the Soul of Light in front of him. "They gave you these. Weren't they scared you'd run away with the soul crystal or something?"</p>

  <p>The courier laughed. "You've got quite the sense of humor, sir! My corporeal body is in the Separate Abyss race. How in the world would I be able to run away?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged and figured that it made sense. The Separate Abyss race was a super force, so there was a huge possibility that they would have a number of warriors from other races serving them.</p>

  <p>Since the soul crystal had been delivered, the courier stepped back into the star ring and returned to Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body left the Other Shore and his Soul of Light returned. He had no intention of staying at Stage Twelve for too long. Instead, he entered the star ring and continued straight to Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Stage Thirteen, also known as the Ethereal Glorious Stage, was the last and most important stage of the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Most Souls of Light stayed here in search of the most suitable Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Glorious Stage never disappointed. Even until now, this stage continued to hold a lot of unveiled secrets and unexplored temples.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, its splendor was countered by how dangerous it was. Six or seven native races lived in this stage along with other strong and dangerous creatures that still hadn't formed their own tribe. It was easily the most perilous stage in the entire Lust World.</p>

  <p>Several great forces had made numerous attempts to control the Ethereal Glorious Stage, much like how the Separate Abyss race managed to gain control of Stage Eleven. However, all of them failed. The natives of this stage fought with each other quite violently so there was no way the Souls of Light from the Source World could come in and take control.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached Stage Thirteen, he was a bit taken aback to how different it was from what he initially imagined. "I thought Stage Thirteen would be desolate. I didn't expect it to be quite a busy place."</p>

  <p>Star rings from all races were strewn about here and there. What was most peculiar was the fact that despite the co-existence of all sorts of creatures, they got along rather harmoniously.</p>

  <p>Souls of Light who had the ability to step into Stage Thirteen were usually Indigo Souls or one step away from that realm.</p>

  <p>"Elite disciples of all races from the Source World gather here in Stage Thirteen. There are naturally more Indigo Souls here," Dorothy told him.</p>

  <p>Unlike Luo Zheng, she didn't seem that surprised at the scene before them despite the fact that this was her first time here.</p>

  <p>The two of them went past the randomly strewn star rings and headed south where they stumbled upon a one-floor building.</p>

  <p>Dorothy sighed with relief. "It's here!"</p>

  <p>No race ever built a temple in Stage Thirteen, instead, they constructed simple strongholds and the one in front of them was built by none other than the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>
