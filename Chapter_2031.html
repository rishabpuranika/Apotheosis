<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2031 Is He Not Afraid Of Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>A gale swept across the Iron Moon City as Maha slowly descended from the other side, a lazy expression on his face.</p>

  <p>However, the Mu Ning of his Great Dominance Technique made him seem like an emperor who descended upon this supreme world, and all living beings had to kneel in front of him.</p>

  <p>The last time Maha used the Great Dominance Technique, it had been completely ineffective on Luo Zheng. It was because Zheng's soul was stronger than Maha's and he also had the Emperor Soul Imprint in his soul, whose Mu Ning was more powerful than Maha's Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan's soul was a bit weaker than Zheng's, which made it harder for him to resist Maha's Great Dominance Technique. It was why his willpower instantly collapsed when Maha shouted "Enough." Even his spear stopped moving.</p>

  <p>Maha was waiting here for Luo Zheng. He did not expect Nathan to arrive.</p>

  <p>Since the human Supreme Lords were willing to use a Godly Genius to test him, he would make this Godly Genius pay with the price of his life.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Connie took advantage of the moment Nathan was distracted and quickly retreated behind Maha.</p>

  <p>Her face was drained of color and her heart hammered erratically in her chest. If Maha hadn't arrived on time, then she would've probably lost her life by now. She realized that in the face of a true powerhouse from the Evolutionary Universe, all the treasures she had that she used to protect her life seemed to be completely useless.</p>

  <p>"Alas, what a pity! Maha actually stopped him!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan almost killed that woman!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. That woman isn't important in the first place."</p>

  <p>At that point, the weaker martial artists in the Iron Moon City trembled with fear as they crawled up from the ground. They couldn't help but shudder at the fact that Maha was able to pressure them to kneel on the ground by force. Some of the stronger martial artists were able to resist the Great Dominance Technique's power, but it was because Maha originally directed it at Nathan. The others had only been affected as well.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nathan didn't regret that he wasn't able to kill Connie.</p>

  <p>After all, his target now was Maha. Moreover, he and his seniors had planned meticulously and prepared a path of retreat. Thus, he wasn't afraid of Maha in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"The Great Dominance Technique..."</p>

  <p>Nathan flashed a small smile and with a wave of his hand, a thin rope appeared around his chest. Dangling from the rope was a pale green stone. The stone emitted a faint glow that enveloped his head.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Sarira?" Maha briefly glanced at the small stone on Nathan's chest and furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>"The Great Dominance Technique should be one of the most useless Godly Ways. Only people without brains would choose it," Nathan said mockingly.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Luo Zheng came from different backgrounds. Nathan was from the Xuanyuan Clan and was more arrogant than Luo Zheng. Furthermore, it was also because of his affluent family that he had an abundance of treasures, just like Connie.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, any martial artist with a lower cultivation than Maha's would be forced to submit to his Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>His technique's suppressing abilities were just too strong and terrifying.</p>

  <p>If Maha's soul were to raise to a certain realm, just a single glance would be enough to make tens of thousands of creatures bow down before him.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, all Holy Beings had to learn the Great Dominance Technique. In addition, it was also a method to control the True Gods. It was why the Great Dominance Technique was ranked in the top thirty of the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Now, if Maha's opponent had a soul strength that was similar or stronger than his own, then the Great Dominance Technique would have no effects on them. It was useless to use it against stronger foes.</p>

  <p>The reason Maha had chosen the Godly Way of the Great Dominance Technique was because the Sacred race had raised him to become the leader of the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan had come prepared this time and had used the Heavenly Sarira to protect his soul, which was also resistant to the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Maha said with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>Then, he clenched his right hand in the air. Rays of rhombus-shaped light beams condensed constantly in the air, and a light purple blade appeared in his hand. The blade had an evil dragon baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. "When I think about it carefully, the Great Dominance Technique is indeed very weak. A Holy Being who practices this Godly Way can control the True Gods in the divine land by will.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it is of little use to me. But I'm just cultivating the Great Dominance Technique for fun. Who said that a martial artist can only cultivate a Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Maha's words sparked discussion among the martial artists of the Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>"He only trained in the Godly Way for fun. How arrogant can he be?"</p>

  <p>"He must be boasting!"</p>

  <p>"He should be bragging, though it seems that he must have trained in more than one Godly Way."</p>

  <p>To be able to comprehend a Godly Way was enough to make one become a Godly Genius. Then again, the world had always been unfair� not only could some geniuses comprehend a Godly Way, they were also able to simultaneously cultivate several Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>However, such a phenomenon wasn't rare in the divine land.</p>

  <p>For instance, some of the warriors Luo Zheng had encountered in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had cultivated the Great Wishing Spell while they cultivated the main Godly Way. It was because all the True Gods in the divine land were required to cultivate the Great Wishing Spell. Besides, almost all True Gods in the divine land would choose two or more Godly Ways to cultivate.</p>

  <p>On one hand, Nathan coldly sneered at Maha's words.</p>

  <p>Maha and Nathan had similar attitudes. Both of them came from the most powerful clans in their respective universes, and both their clans had placed high expectations on them. Yet there was something wrong with Nathan's fate, and he had somehow ended up being Zheng's substitute.</p>

  <p>As for Maha, he was treated much better than Nathan in the Sacred race in all aspects.</p>

  <p>They were both raised in environments that in turn, created their characters. Therefore, Nathan understood that Maha's words were only meant to suppress him.</p>

  <p>After Nathan's experience in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land combined with being repeatedly suppressed and "educated" by Luo Zheng, his state of mind had long since changed. At this point, he was naturally unperturbed as he simply said, "Then let's make our move."</p>

  <p>In turn, Maha lightly retracted the blade in his hand and aimed it at Nathan as he made a gesture. His demeanor had completely changed.</p>

  <p>Gone was his playful and disrespectful attitude; it was as if he had become a completely different person in blink of an eye, and became one with the blade in his hand.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere turned as dark and serious as his Mu Ning. His sharp and piercing blade glinted under the light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before Maha charged straight towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nathan did not hesitate. After all, he had already mentally prepared himself to face Maha and it wasn't as if he didn't have a path of retreat. At that moment, he understood that all he needed to do was put all of his effort into displaying his ultimate strength.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Maha's blade was about two inches wide and although it was called a blade, it was actually thinner than most swords. The blade and the hilt were both 6 feet long, and each took up half of its length which was a total of 12 feet long. It was 2.1 feet longer than Nathan's spear, which was 9.9 feet long.</p>

  <p>Maha immediately swung his blade down. A dark red blade shadow trailed behind it as he aimed it straight towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>He didn't use any techniques, nor was there anything special about it. It was simply an extremely fast blade movement executed in an equally fierce and imposing manner.</p>

  <p>The blade Maha wielded was none other than the fourth ranked Fiend Dragon Blade in the Murphy Universe, while the spear in Nathan's hand was the eighth ranked Heaven-piercing Spear on the Universe Spirit Tablet of the Evolutionary Universe. There wasn't much difference between the two weapons in terms of ranking.</p>

  <p>As Maha continued to strike, he thought that Nathan would first dodge his attack and then counterattack.</p>

  <p>What he did not expect was that Nathan didn't even bother to dodge.</p>

  <p>Instead, his eyes flashed mischievously and he stabbed with his spear, releasing the Law Spear Strike. He didn't care if Maha would hurt him.</p>

  <p>While it was true that Maha could split Nathan into two, he probably wouldn't be able to survive if Nathan pierced him with his spear, either.</p>

  <p>'Is he unafraid of death?' Maha thought.</p>

  <p>In addition, he also didn't think that Nathan would work so hard.</p>

  <p>Nathan felt that he understood Maha, and Maha also understood people like Nathan. People like them had always held themselves to a high regard and viewed their lives as something more important than the heavens. It was to the point where they might not even be willing to sacrifice themselves if the entire universe was destroyed. However, Nathan's move was undoubtedly way out of Maha's imagination.</p>
