  <p>"Not many life stones, though I did manage to collect quite a lot supreme life vitality crystals. I already have over 30, 000 of them now," Camilla replied, pouting her lips. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng was not interested in supreme life vitality crystals at all. All he wanted was life stones, and life stones only. But every single life stone that any other warrior had dug out had already been taken over. She had bought them at a very high price, and now no one had any life stones left. She had been using some rare ores to lure these warriors. Some of them had even tried borrowing life stones from others, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>All the life stones were here now, in Camilla's hands. Who were they going to borrow from?</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Luo Zheng replied as he walked towards the pyramid once again.</p>

  <p>He had completed his exploration of the 34th layer of the pyramid now, and his target was the next one. There was even a chance that with increasing height, the chances of finding life stones decreased, but he still had to try.</p>

  <p>As he arrived at the 35th layer of the pyramid, he saw a special door.</p>

  <p>Every single door that he had seen on the pyramid was supported by two gray pillars, forming a narrow passageway that was only as wide as an average person. This essentially meant that only one person could enter at a time.</p>

  <p>However, there was a different door in the 35th layer. The pillars of this door were carved out of two Genuine Dragons. These two Genuine Dragons were staring at Luo Luo Zheng with their mouths wide open, looking very lifelike and slightly scary.</p>

  <p>'Why is this door different?' Luo Luo Zheng thought as a hint of curiosity appeared on his face. Perhaps this was special.</p>

  <p>Most warriors had chosen to mine for ores below the 30th layer, and none of the divine-level talents was willing to enter the 35th layer or above. The reason was very simple; it was going to be a complete waste of time anyhow. They couldn't dig out the ores from the leaves of the 35 layer at all, and if they were to encounter mineral-devouring bugs, then their lives would be in danger as well. Even a simple green mineral-devouring bug would prove quite difficult for them to handle.</p>

  <p>Without much thought, Luo Luo Zheng decided to investigate.</p>

  <p>After he stepped through the door, he fell down just like he had for the past 34 layers. Soon, he found himself on top of a giant leaf. However, this leaf was completely different from the others.</p>

  <p>The other leaves had been as beautiful and clear as glass. They had been glowing with an enchanting blue light. The higher the layer, the darker the blue. However, the giant leaf underneath Luo Zheng's feet right now was glowing with a golden light.</p>

  <p>"This leaf seems to be very special." A curious expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he began to size it up carefully.</p>

  <p>During his appraisal of the leaf, Luo Zheng's gaze suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>"That is... a pickax! What rank is it? It looks special to me!" Luo Luo Zheng cried out involuntarily.</p>

  <p>A short pickax was embedded in the middle of this pale golden leaf and it looked very beautiful indeed. The whole body of the pickax was jet-black, but the Mu Ning it exuded had given Luo Luo Zheng quite a bit of a shock. More importantly, there was a faint flow of strange divine textures on the pickax, and these divine textures seemed very powerful.</p>

  <p>"Ten-star divine textures! There are three ten-star divine textures on this pickax," Luo Luo Zheng cried out again.</p>

  <p>He couldn't recognize the divine textures of the four divine kingdoms and the ones that belonged to the human race in the Upper World. But the divine textures of the Dragon Lineage Human were inherited from the Genuine Dragon and Luo Luo Zheng had practiced drawing them through the cyan dragon. So he had at least a basic idea of them.</p>

  <p>In any case, even in the Upper World, a ten-star divine texture was considered the pinnacle of divine textures. Even if the cyan dragon was at his peak, it would still take him an enormous amount of effort and time to draw a ten-star divine texture. And time wasn't the only factor to be considered. The materials needed to draw a ten-star divine texture were even harder to find than to draw the texture itself.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Luo Zheng had relied on three five-star divine textures to block the assault of a Life and Death Realm warrior. The disparity between two successive levels of divine textures was as great as the difference between heaven and earth. A six-star divine texture was thousands of times stronger than a five-star divine texture. A seven-star divine texture was thousands of times more than that! Judging by that, one could, maybe, imagine the power of an eight-star divine texture.</p>

  <p>This pickax, however, had three ten-star divine textures! What grade of treasure was this pickax?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't able to figure it out, but he knew in his heart that since there were three ten-star divine textures engraved on the pickax, its grade would definitely not be low! In fact, he wouldn't be surprised if this pickax was the pinnacle of all weapons.</p>

  <p>'Should I dig it out?'</p>

  <p>This thought jumped out uncontrollably into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>However, in retrospect, the door to this leaf wasn't exactly hidden, which meant that many warriors must have seen the pickax before. Most of them were Life and Death Realm warriors and Soul Sea Realm warriors, and even Soul Sea Realm warriors couldn't take out this pickax. How was he going to get this pickax out?</p>

  <p>Although this thought came in his mind, Luo Luo Zheng still took out his pickax, which was a sacred weapon, and walked towards the light golden leaf.</p>

  <p>After he stood still, he used the pickax in his hand and lightly tapped the leaf twice.</p>

  <p>The light golden leaf responded with two muffled sounds.</p>

  <p>After aiming in a certain direction, Luo Luo Zheng raised the pickax in his hand high and slapped it down hard on the leaf, hoping for the best.</p>

  <p>Pak! Boom! Clang!</p>

  <p>The first sound was the sound of Luo Zheng's pickax hitting the surface of the leaf. The second sound was the sound of the pickax breaking into two clear pieces as if it had been made of eggshell. The third sound was that of the broken pickax rolling down to the edge on his left and falling down.</p>

  <p>When he saw this scene, Luo Luo Zheng was stunned for a moment before a wry smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Although the pickax that Randy had given Luo Luo Zheng was a low-grade sacred weapon, it had been damaged to such a degree that it was almost broken before he hit the leaf with it. The hardness of the light gold leaf under Luo Zheng's feet was simply unimaginable.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's judgment, this light golden leaf was probably as strong as a divine weapon itself.</p>

  <p>In other words, if one wanted to make a divine weapon, he could simply use this leaf as a raw material, in its true form!</p>

  <p>When the low-grade sacred weapon had struck the leaf, it had been the same as hitting a stone with an egg, instantly breaking it apart.</p>

  <p>The pickax was broken, but not a single trace of the assault had appeared on the leaf.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the pitch-black pickax quietly lying under the leaf, he pursed his lips into a thin line. He wasn't going to admit defeat yet. The space ring on his finger flashed and he took out a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>The sword that had appeared in his hand was famed for its sharpness, but it was not suitable for mining. In terms of overall strength, it was far from a pickax. Luo Luo Zheng drew his sword for a while and stood still but still couldn't bring himself to stab the leaf. He was afraid that his sword would be broken as well if he used it to hit the leaf.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Luo Luo Zheng sighed and jumped down from the light golden leaf.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng appeared on the side of the pyramid, carrying a broken pickax, Randy asked curiously, "Tianxing, how did you manage to break the pickax?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently waved the broken pickax in his hand and smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>This pickax had been lent to him by Randy after all, but now he had broken it.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible. Even if you were mining in the 35th layer, it is impossible for a low-grade sacred weapon to break so quickly and so cleanly!" Randy remarked with a puzzled expression. This pickax was a low-grade sacred weapon, and as far as he knew, it was completely suitable for mining. The head of the pickax was thick and wide.</p>

  <p>Normally, it would be extremely difficult to break it. It was not that Randy was blaming Luo Luo Zheng for breaking the pickax. Obtaining a low grade sacred weapon was extremely hard, but Randy valued Luo Luo Zheng more than some pickax.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng replied honestly, "I found something strange in the 35th layer."</p>

  <p>"What?" When he heard Luo Zheng's words, a look of realization suddenly appeared on Randy's face. "You mean the pickax in the gold leaf, right?</p>

  <p>You didn't try to dig that out, did you?"</p>

  <p>That light golden leaf was not hard to find and Randy obviously knew about it. Luo Luo Zheng then nodded his head. He was a bit embarrassed for having broken his companion's pickax.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! That explains it. Dude, my fault! I should've told you earlier."</p>

  <p>Randy then explained, "That golden leaf is impossible to break. The pickax that is wrapped in that golden leaf is called 'Black Star.' It is recorded in the records of the Dragon Lineage Human. You know, it is a supreme divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>"A supreme divine weapon?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned. At first, he thought that divine weapons were similar to sacred weapons and were divided into top grade, mid grade, and low grade. It seemed that this was not the case.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Luo Luo Zheng had never come into contact with a divine weapon before. Since right now both the cyan dragon and the red dragon were sleeping, and Xun was immersed in the Soul Nurturing Wood, he had nobody he could ask about it.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled and replied, "I am not sure exactly how powerful a supreme divine weapon is. Anyway, this is how the documents recorded about the pickax. The most important usage of this pickax is not to defend against the enemy, but to mine. It is used to break the leaves on the top of the mine!"</p>
