<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3542 The Green-skinned Men </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>They traveled dozens of miles in the Dark Region before the surrounding scenery gradually returned to normal.</p>

  <p>A number of dark plants formed a boundless jungle.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge made to pass through the dense jungle when the branches of the plants began to shake.</p>

  <p>One single branch might not be strong, but thousands of branches could entangle even a strong prey to death.</p>

  <p>These branches were now considering Zheng and Feng Ge as potential preys and were preparing to attack them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes flashed as she glared at the approaching branches. "You're about to turn to ash. Excited, are you?" she asked, venom dripping her voice.</p>

  <p>These demonic plants were sentient and could think. Feng Ge's threat caused them to rapidly shrink away, like ants fleeing in all directions.</p>

  <p>The plants had formed a clump in the middle of the jungle, making it difficult to cross. But at Feng Ge's threat, they began to part, forming a convenient path as they fell to ground.</p>

  <p>"That's more like it," Feng Ge sneered and walked forward, her head held high.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and shook his head at her back. It was obvious that these creatures in the Dark Region were terrified of Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Once they passed through the dense jungle, they saw dark, high mountains loom up ahead of them. The tops of the mountains seemed to graze the sky, but because of the darkness, they could not tell how high these mountains actually were.</p>

  <p>The first thing they had to do after entering the Dark Region was to find the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>But they were difficult to find since there was no intelligent creature around.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge traveled for a distance along the mountains' lengths when they spotted fire in the distance.</p>

  <p>The only thing apart from the Great Sanskrit Light of a purified being that could produce light in the Dark Region was a candle. The light that they could now see was probably produced by a candle.</p>

  <p>They approached the light cautiously and as they had expected, spotted a candle not far from them.</p>

  <p>The ignited candle sat in an open space, burning alone.</p>

  <p>The power of the candlelight could not be compared to that of the Great Sanskrit Light or the natural light in the Light Region, but it was still threatening to the creatures in the Dark Region. Unless they ate the Light Fruit, they could easily be hurt if they were within the candlelight's range.</p>

  <p>It seemed like someone had intentionally put this candle here, though they didn't know who and why.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge remained silent as they hid, observing the candle and its surroundings.</p>

  <p>It was not long before rustling sounds could be heard through the darkness.</p>

  <p>A huge cricket-like insect, which was nearly three feet tall, jumped out and moved towards the candle.</p>

  <p>Going by the fearless way in which it entered the candle's periphery, the insect seemed not to be afraid of the candle.</p>

  <p>The gentle yellow light of the candle began to work on the insect, causing it to erode more with every passing second.</p>

  <p>In no time, the surface of the insect's body had become mottled, and its thin limbs had fallen off its body. It wasn't long before it fell with a thud in the candlelight.</p>

  <p>The candlelight still worked on the big insect's body. If no one interfered, it would eventually disappear in the candlelight.</p>

  <p>But a small loop of rope suddenly shot out and wrapped around the insect's body and pulled it out of the range of the candlelight.</p>

  <p>All this happened very quickly, as if done by someone that was quite skilled.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could react, the big insect had already been pulled into darkness.</p>

  <p>"There must be an intelligent creature behind. Let's go and find it!" Feng Ge whispered into Zheng's ear.</p>

  <p>The intelligent creatures living in the Dark Region must know the whereabouts of the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge made to walk towards where the insect had disappeared, but Zheng reached out and grabbed her hand.</p>

  <p>The risks in the Dark Region were much greater than in the Light Region.</p>

  <p>They had to be vigilant no matter what. He said, "Let's wait and see first."</p>

  <p>They stayed where they were, keeping an eye on the candlelight.</p>

  <p>Minutes later, they could hear more rustling sounds from the grass.</p>

  <p>This time it was a big black centipede that was about a dozen feet long that was creating the sound. The centipede raised its long slender body to observe the candlelight before unhesitatingly crawling forward towards it.</p>

  <p>It met the same end as the cricket-like insect. .</p>

  <p>A loop of rope shot out again and tied itself around the body of the centipede before dragging it towards the grass.</p>

  <p>The big centipede was tenacious and struggled as it went.</p>

  <p>While the big centipede struggled, Zheng followed the course of the rope and spotted a big, dark green hand pulling at it from the grass. He didn't know which race this creature was from, but he was sure it wasn't one of the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>"They're just using the candlelight to catch weak insects. Nothing interesting here," Feng Ge said, bored.</p>

  <p>"Let's go around it then," Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>They weren't out to hurt anyone and shouldn't be viewed as enemies. They just wanted to make some inquiries.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng stood up, something in the sky began to buzz. dozens of huge wasps circled in the air above them and shot towards Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were colored brilliantly, making it obvious that they were highly poisonous.</p>

  <p>"Hide behind me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled Feng Ge behind him.</p>

  <p>He then turned and stretched out a hand to slap at the wasps.</p>

  <p>His strike was so quick that the poisonous wasps were immediately smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>They had barely dealt with the poisonous wasps when they found giant spiders and foot-long colored centipedes making their way to them on the grass nearby.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not afraid of these poisonous insects, but the appearance of these strange insects caused Feng Ge's hair to stand on end.</p>

  <p>Had she not been afraid of alerting the enemy, she would have released massive amounts of Great Sanskrit Light to burn off all the poisonous insects in this area.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge had no choice but to retreat from their hiding place. The moment they did so, two green-skinned men rushed out of the grass, moving nimbly as they did.</p>

  <p>They had dark red hair that looked like weeds and looked terrifying.</p>

  <p>The men had emerged, throwing loops of rope towards Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge looked at each other. A tacit understanding passed between them and they did not dodge the rope loops.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men were overjoyed to see that their targets were easily trapped. But before they could tie up the ropes, they felt an irresistible force coming from the other end of the ropes. They were being dragged towards Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men realized that something was amiss and were about to drop to the ground, intending to jump into the grass. But the moment they did so, they felt two tiny rays of white light flashing past the corners of their eyes. Sharp pain pinched at their feet. Looking downwards, they discovered that the light rays had pierced their feet and they were now firmly nailed to the ground.</p>
