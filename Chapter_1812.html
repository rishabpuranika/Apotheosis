<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a member of the Sacred race, Maha knew the divine land better than anyone else in the universe. If he could say so himself, he knew the ins and outs of the land like the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>Similar to the the Upper World and Lower World, the universe was a lower plane compared to the divine land.</p>

  <p>The rules of cultivation in the universe were set by the Holy Being and no one else.</p>

  <p>Because of this, it was natural for the people of the divine land to think of themselves highly and regard the creatures of the universe as weaker and inferior to them.</p>

  <p>Even the Godly Geniuses had to painstakingly go through tens of millions of years of hard work just to have the qualifications to be on equal footing with the geniuses of the divine land. It took them endless blood and sweat, and a staggering massive amount of resources, just to get that far.</p>

  <p>But this was simply the natural order of things and the glaring difference that they were born with.</p>

  <p>Maha was the son of a True God. With his status and high birth, he was able to stand tall and be proud among the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>However, he could never be satisfied with his current situation as long as he was still alive. He yearned for more.</p>

  <p>He wanted to set out and go to the divine land to become a True God. In the past, he had already gone to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land where he reaped quite a lot of benefits.</p>

  <p>But it was not enough as he was still unable to become a True God, like he had wished. Actually, condensing a Godly Tile was a really hard feat to achieve.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words were hitting the wrong cord in Maha, and it made him frown. A dangerous shadow passed over his face and sharpened his demonic eyes as a fuse of anger lit in his chest, taking over his system.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the True God of the Sacred race, his father, was not able to come to this round of the universe in person due to a number of reasons.</p>

  <p>This was the very reason why the Sacred race chose to negotiate instead.</p>

  <p>But this sorry bunch of old bastards were not easily swayed and they refused his request, much to his frustration.</p>

  <p>'If that is the case, why not just use the power of a True God to kill this person?'</p>

  <p>Maha stunned himself when this dangerous thought surfaced to the forefront of his mind. It seemed that he had not been aware that he was terrified of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Even though I'm just a world lord, killing you is still a piece of cake to me," Maha murmured with venom in his voice.</p>

  <p>He was quite a decisive man. Once he made a decision, he would always carry it out. He was a man of his own words and he always relied on his intuition and judgment. Since Luo Luo Zheng gave him a sense of danger, there was absolutely no way he'd let him grow freely.</p>

  <p>Those nine Supreme Lords also seemed to understand this Godly Genius' temperament very well. They knew that although Maha's personality was arrogant, cruel, and ruthless, he'd never broken his promises before and would always see them through.</p>

  <p>It was just like what Maha had said. Once he became a True God, he would definitely kill that Supreme Lord Healum. Nothing would stop him in accomplishing that in the future.</p>

  <p>As Maha spoke, Master Feng gently waved his hand in the air. An invisible force spread out from his gesture, forming a daunting and towering high wall.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Maha wasn't even worth mentioning, but they had to be wary of that giant hand. It was the hand of a True God, after all, and they knew just how dangerous it was. The moment they lost their guard and they got hit, there was a high chance that they could not endure his blow.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, all of the Supreme Lords grew quiet, simmering in their own thoughts of fear. None of them wanted to provoke a powerful True God.</p>

  <p>But if they stayed idle and refused to make a move, then it would appear as if they had allowed Maha to parade around and step over them with that arrogant attitude of his.</p>

  <p>"I admit, I'm not your match right now," Luo Luo Zheng said, his smile not wavering. He continued, "However, the moment I become a world lord, I swear I will only use one finger to end you."</p>

  <p>As he said this, he also extended a finger toward Maha.</p>

  <p>Maha was a tyrant among the Sacred race. His father was a True God that transcended the universe, and his talent was unprecedented in the universe where the Sacred race lived. This kind of words had always been thrown at others by him. What qualifications did the others have to treat him like he was a mere pest in their eyes?</p>

  <p>He'd never thought that this Luo Luo Zheng, the man who had made him feel uneasy and a tad bit afraid, would prove to be an even more arrogant prick than he was at this moment.</p>

  <p>Unknowingly, the confrontation between the two universes gradually focused on the heated tension between Luo Luo Zheng and Maha.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords that had gathered within the Celestial Position race had yet to make a move. The same was true of the Supreme Lords and the True God's hand standing behind Maha. Everyone was standing still with bated breaths.</p>

  <p>In the end, both of them stared the other off and hesitated to move. They didn't want to make a mistake and fall out with each other.</p>

  <p>However, with Maha's arrogant and brash personality, he was not one to care about this sort of balance. He had never been at a disadvantageous position before. When he heard Luo Zheng's words, Maha let out an icy smile.</p>

  <p>Then he controlled the giant hand behind him and launched a direct attack toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
