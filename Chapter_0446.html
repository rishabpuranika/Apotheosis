<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 446 I Believe In Luo Zheng Too (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Yan was undeniably a superb talent of Cloud Sect. An idea of her talent could be taken from the fact that she had bested Luo Zheng in both grade and speed. When it was time for the All Peaks Competition, she had already reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, and if that wasn't enough, she was only 15 years old at the time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng was 17 years old at the moment but was merely at grade two of the nature level. So compared to Yan, Luo Zheng was quite slow in cultivation speed. However, that did not mean he had been totally overtaken.</p>

  <p>When it came to fighting capacity, he was several notches above Yan.</p>

  <p>Not only her, he was above almost all personal disciples. In the previous All Peaks Competition, the performance of disciples which were competing on behalf of some peak was not so good.</p>

  <p>The top three, and even the top five places were all occupied by personal disciples, who had easily outwitted the disciples from the peaks.</p>

  <p>But this year, the competition had been fiercer than ever and of the top 3 contenders, two were fighting on behalf of peaks. They were Luo Zheng and Tianming. What was more, neither one of them was at the Illuminating Soul Realm. This was the first time in history that such a result had been seen and until today, such a result was beyond anyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming weren't the only black horses to break the record. The top inner disciples from other peaks like Wing, Sheeny, Jason, and Jill had also managed to defeat the personal disciples quite easily.</p>

  <p>So this time, the peak disciples had prevailed over the personal disciples in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Among the personal disciples, only Patrick had managed to land a spot amongst the top five. It was up to him now.</p>

  <p>As the pillar of the personal disciples, he had mastered the mysterious Buddhist cultivation method and his real strength was too deep for common men to predict. It was all on him now to defend the dignity of the personal disciples. If he lost too, then the year was going to be remembered forever as one when the personal disciples failed completely.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng.." Master Xu of the Skytop Peak murmured the name, lost deep in some thought.</p>

  <p>Master Xu had a good memory, and even if he hadn't, Luo Zheng wasn't the sort of person he would have forgotten easily. He still remembered the time when Luo Zheng had entered the Bloody Mountain for the trial practice. Not only had he managed to defeat a master like Ryan, he had also killed the only grade five unreal beast of the Bloody Mountain in the end. That way, he had earned the only black crystal fragment for his practice. This was a remarkable achievement, because ever since the time the Bloody Mountain was established, no disciple had ever earned the black crystal fragment.</p>

  <p>From that moment onwards, Master Xu had become determined to get Luo Zheng on his side. He wanted to invite Luo Zheng and ask him to join the Skytop Peak. For this sole purpose, he had even gotten into quite an argument with Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, not only did that argument go south for him, Mu Ning had also won Zheng's heart first. He didn't know what kind of method she had used to persuade Luo Zheng, but he was completely devoted to her now.</p>

  <p>Foiled in his attempts, all Master Xu could do was think viciously,</p>

  <p>'Although Luo Zheng is a potentially expensive diamond in the rough, does this Drizzle Peak which ranks the last possess any ability to carve him into a shining jewel?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had swept everyone aside and stood aloft in majesty. He had shown extraordinary talent in the All Peaks Competition and had even become the key opponent of the strongest disciple of the Skytop Peak - Tianming.</p>

  <p>If Master Xu was given another chance, he would have definitely made another offer to him at a higher price when he was at the Bloody Mountain. As it turned out, Master Xu's initial assessment was wrong. A diamond needed to be polished. Luo Zheng... Luo Zheng was Platinum. He shone everywhere! There was no need to polish him. He seemed to be gold replenished with ever growing spells.</p>

  <p>But alas! Master Xu had already missed him and that much could not be changed. Mu Ning had already beaten him and enlisted Luo Zheng first. Master Xu heaved a sigh and shook his head. Fortunately, Tianming was there fighting for the Skytop Peak. His strength and potential was not lesser than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was yet to see who was going to be declared the final winner.</p>

  <p>The round robin continued. More and more disciples whose names were in the lottery box were wiped out. With each passing round, the probability of Patrick, Tianming, and Luo Zheng getting pitted against each other increased.</p>

  <p>Under every one's gaze, the steward went on drawing lots to decide the competitors of the next round. Finally, after numerous rounds, when he gave the names of the next contenders to the referee, the referee immediately announced, "Tianming of the Skytop Peak Vs Luo Zheng of the Drizzle Peak!"</p>

  <p>"Finally it happens!"</p>

  <p>"The showdown between two super talents of the Cloud Sect! I feel like my blood is going to rush out any moment!"</p>

  <p>"Will Tianming use the sword? I really want to see his sword. What does it look like? Draw the sword!"</p>

  <p>Tianming looked very calm. He slowly walked towards the arena. Against his graceful steps, Luo Zheng also ambled inside, looking calm and relaxed.</p>

  <p>After they had arrived at the center of the arena and were now facing each other, Luo Zheng smiled and asked, "Everyone wants to see your sword today, Tianming. Is it really your plan to let it hang at your back during the entire competition?"</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and smiled as well, "I said this before, I didn't use my sword because there was no need to. I never wanted to make a mystery out of my sword."</p>

  <p>"But what about now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am going to draw my sword." The crowd hooted after Tianming finished his words, Tianming reached out his slim fingers and grasped the sword on his back. He slowly drew it out from the sheath, inch by inch, each unit making the crowd go wild.</p>

  <p>"Tianming is finally drawing his sword! We have waited for the moment for so long. It looks like Luo Zheng is the opponent that he is really worried about!"</p>

  <p>"What kind of sword on earth is that? I really can't wait to see it!"</p>

  <p>All the disciples gazed at Tianming's hand without batting an eyelid, curious about what the weapon was going to look like.</p>

  <p>When Tianming finally took the sword completely out of the sheath, all the people were amazed.</p>

  <p>"What's this? A rusty sword? Hang on, do swords rust?"</p>

  <p>"No silly. They don't."</p>

  <p>"So what, is that a common iron sword? My God! The sword that Tianming has kept with him all the time is turning out to be a load of crap!"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Only a narrow-minded person like you is going to think it's crap.</p>

  <p>With Tianming's strength and knowledge, do you honestly think he is going to put a piece of crap on his back?"</p>

  <p>"Okay, you're smart. So tell us what kind of precious sword would rust."</p>

  <p>The sword Tianming had taken out was indeed covered with red spots.</p>

  <p>The weapon refining skills of the Eastern Region had made it possible for any weapons, even the mysterious ones, to get preserved for decades.</p>

  <p>If well maintained, the spiritual weapons were supposed to last several hundred years without rusting out or losing their shine and sharpness. As for fairy weapons, they could last as long as a span of thousands of years.</p>
