  <p>Now, Lewis regretted that he hadn't obtained the blue treasure box. If he had gone all out to take it and had sucked the nine-headed dragon's blood vigor, his small wound would've healed immediately.</p>

  <p>They had reached the dark jungle, but they barely saw anything except the tiny glimmers of light. They only moved forward by instinct.</p>

  <p>Lewis had shut up this time. It was a critical moment and he wasn't dumb, otherwise he wouldn't have had such a high strength level. He would be headed towards an early grave if he dared to rant or even speak in such place.</p>

  <p>They had only walked in the dark and quiet jungle for a short while before they suddenly heard something swish in the air and shoot towards them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sound was faint but Luo Luo Zheng had heard it.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Lewis reminded. Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng had reacted quickly.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and pulled Tianming back. Then, they saw a small, dark narrow shadow brush past them. However, it grazed past Tianming and hurt his arm.</p>

  <p>The fabric that covered Tianming's arm was cut open and revealed a small scratch on the skin.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>Tianming held his Blood-corroding Sword in his hand and cautiously looked around.</p>

  <p>The small black shadow didn't seem to be a hidden weapon like a dart, since they all saw it swerve its direction after it hit Tianming, and disappeared into the jungle again. It was more like some kind of creature.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lewis sniffed the air and his eyes widened. "I saw it. It is a kind of a tiny bat. It has very thin, sharp wings like a blade. This kind of blade bat has hurt Tianming," he suddenly blurted out.</p>

  <p>"How did you see that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously. A giggle escaped Lewis' lips.</p>

  <p>"I have a special talent to see things in the dark. As long as there is a glimmer of light, I can see everything clearly without difficulty. Even if it's so dim here, I can still see clearly as if we were in broad daylight," he said.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he had an inborn night vision.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until then that Luo Luo Zheng noticed that Lewis' eyes had a blue flash of light. His eyes were similar to those of cats, which could see things in low-light conditions.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, dudes. There are a lot of them around..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Lewis' words sank in, they heard a wave of rustling sounds. It looked like the bats came in groups as the swishing sounds engulfed the air.</p>

  <p>A large number of black shadows rushed towards them in the dark. They had extremely sharp wings, which left long and narrow cuts on anything they hit.</p>

  <p>At that moment, sword intent appeared and circled around Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming to protect them. It formed a cyclone which firmly wrapped them up within its shield of protection.</p>

  <p>Any blade that came to attack them would be instantly smashed into pieces by the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>Although the blade bats had sharp wings and were numerous in number, they were actually quite weak individually. Luo Zheng's and Tianming's shields of sword intent were the bane of the bats and it killed all of them that tried to attack.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>However, Lewis didn't have the tough sword intent that Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming possessed. He had no choice but to wrap his body within his cloak. That way, he completely hid his scent.</p>

  <p>Those bats didn't have eyes. They sensed the existence of humans in a very special way. Lewis' magical cloak prevented his scent from being detected.</p>

  <p>Even though the three men all had their own ways to protect themselves, they were still on high alert. The Death Road was not an empty name. It wasn't that easy for them to get through.</p>

  <p>They headed forward and there appeared a vortex not far away.</p>

  <p>"Still leading us to another place?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Where will we be led to?" Tianming had a hunch that it was not a good sign. They were headed deeper to a dead end that would eventually lead them to death.</p>

  <p>What humans feared the most was not a monster or a ghost, but uncertainty.</p>

  <p>If they discovered a ghost, they wouldn't be so scared as they saw what it looked like.</p>

  <p>Before they embarked on the Cloud Road, they were aware that there would be a path that led them to the finish line. Although they knew they would face many difficulties along the way, at least they knew where the road headed to.</p>

  <p>But now, the road they trod on was the Death Road. They had no idea where it would bring them to.</p>

  <p>Then again, there were no other better choices. They went through the vortex. An explosive sound was heard when they landed, followed by blazing flames that rose up in the air.</p>

  <p>"It is the Karma Fire!" Luo Luo Zheng screamed. He had recognized it at first sight.</p>

  <p>The flames were the Green Lotus Karma Fire from Patrick.</p>

  <p>But, who was he fighting against? This trick was Patrick's trump card that he usually didn't utilize until someone forced him to do so. When Patrick had initiated his Acalanatha shadow, this technique was only usable again after several days. Moreover, he usually didn't employ it unless he was in great danger. It was clear that Patrick was in a tough situation.</p>

  <p>"Who is Patrick fighting against?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he looked at the direction where the flames came from. "I don't know. Let's go check!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng strode forward and moved quickly to where the flames were from.</p>

  <p>They were rivals in Cloud Sect back then, but they were all now in Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>They were in the same team now since they all came from Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng naturally thought that he must help Patrick at this critical moment.</p>
