</p>

  <p>Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others raised several more questions.</p>

  <p>Once these questions were answered, they had a basic understanding of what the Night View Island was all about.</p>

  <p>A large number of different races— close to a thousand— lived in the annular mountain range around the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>It was weird but astonishing that so many races coexisted on such a small island.</p>

  <p>One or two races were present on almost every mountain here. These races were mainly divided into three tiers and the Wooden Leaf race was among the weakest ones.</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race knew their limitations and rarely came into conflict with other races. That was how they had survived in such a complicated environment.</p>

  <p>"Did you capture your Treacherous Beings in the mountains?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and the others were concerned at Fuxi's question, given that it was an important one. Why were there so many Treacherous Beings on the Night View Island?</p>

  <p>They had encountered a lot of sloth-shaped Treacherous Beings on their way to this mountain, which, according to Decker, was just the tip of the iceberg. The abundance of Treacherous Beings on the Night View Island was way beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>Decker shook his head and said, "Most Treacherous Beings in the mountains are weak and the powerful ones are mainly the killing type. The killing type also likes Arcana and will kill you to plunder your Arcana.</p>

  <p>They're not suitable for warriors to merge with. Our Treacherous Beings came from the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Ghost Mountain?" Fuxi raised an eyebrow in interest.</p>

  <p>"There is a huge Ghost Mountain beyond the annular mountain range on the westernmost side of the Night View Island. There are a large number of friendly-type Treacherous Beings there. You'll see every kind you can think of," explained Decker.</p>

  <p>Confused and curious, Fuxi asked, "Are you saying that you can freely enter the Ghost Mountain and choose a Treacherous Being?"</p>

  <p>Decker shook his head again and answered, "We can't enter the Ghost Mountain at will. We need to accumulate enough Arcana to enter it."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't we see such a mountain when we came out of the lake?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Decker said, understanding dawning in his eyes, "You can only see it after you cross the annular mountain range. You can't see it from the center of the island."</p>

  <p>Zheng was still doubtful. He turned around and asked, "Master Campbell, is the annular mountain range the only highland on the Night View Island?"</p>

  <p>They had seen the island's terrain once they had emerged from the lake.</p>

  <p>There was nothing but the lake at its center and a circle of mountains around it. They would have noticed it if there was a huge Ghost Mountain around there!</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the annular mountain range shapes the edges of the Night View Island. There is nothing but a void beyond the annular mountain range," said Campbell with conviction.</p>

  <p>At this, Zheng's eyes turned cold. "You were lying to us," he said, turning to glare at Decker.</p>

  <p>Pearson hooked his fingers and the silver thread tightened around Decker's neck, cutting into his skin. Blood quickly began to drip from the wound.</p>

  <p>"No, please no! It hurts!" Decker screamed hysterically at the sharp pain. "I told no lies! All that I said is true! You can ask our patriarch if you don't believe me!"</p>

  <p>Graham spoke up hastily. "Yes, yes!" he said. "The Ghost Mountain has been floating outside the island. You can only see it once you climb over the circle of mountains. You can send someone to have a look at it and verify what we're saying!"</p>

  <p>At Decker's and Graham's earnest looks, Pearson relaxed the silver thread on his fingertips. "They don't look like they're lying," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is there really a Ghost Mountain?" the Snake Goddess said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>According to Campbell, the world beyond the Pure Sky Platforms was full of Void Dust, which could devour all substances and energies.</p>

  <p>Campbell had also mentioned that he knew a way of roaming through the Void Dust. This involved using the Spiritual Boat. He didn't say what material the Spiritual Boat was made of. So she surmised that the Ghost Mountain was probably formed by the same substances as the Spiritual Boat, which was probably why it could also roam through the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>"Let's put this question aside for the time being," Zheng said, quickly regaining his composure. "When I mentioned the human race yesterday, you said that you hadn't seen any before. Let me ask you once again. Have you ever seen any other humans before us?"</p>

  <p>This was what they were most concerned about. After all, they were here to find the human heroes.</p>

  <p>Decker hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Answer him!" Pearson barked.</p>

  <p>Decker then admitted hesitantly, "I met a human once before. A tall and sturdy human male. He sat on a fire lotus, flames in his eyes. Beside him was a Treacherous Being that looked like a fiery-dragon and appeared to be very powerful. This man burned up more than ten mountains and annihilated the Thunder race and the White Bone race, which were at the pinnacle of their forces at the time."</p>

  <p>"We didn't know how the Thunder race and the White Bone race had provoked him. His fire was so tremendous that two mountains melted into lava and flowed into the lake," added Graham. He had also witnessed this terrifying scene. The fire hadn't extinguished for several days after that.</p>

  <p>The Thunder race and the White Bone race used to be two ruling races on the Night View Island. They were far more powerful than small races like the Wooden Leaf race, but that human had destroyed them so easily!</p>

  <p>A human male...</p>

  <p>Using formidable flames...</p>

  <p>Tall and sturdy...</p>

  <p>Sitting on a fire lotus...</p>

  <p>These descriptions reminded everyone of the same person. The Snake Goddess and the others turned to look at Zheng, knowing that that man's energy soul existed in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Zheng communicated with his inner world for a while before a vague figure appeared above his head. Zheng pointed at the figure and asked, "Is he the man you were talking about?"</p>

  <p>Zhurong's figure gradually became clear. It was only half his body and the aura of the energy soul was not so strong as his real self, but Decker's and Graham's faces went sheet-white at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>"W-what?!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! That's him! Why is he inside your body?"</p>

  <p>Decker and Graham looked as if they had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>Zhurong looked proud as he watched these members of the Wooden Leaf race stumble over their words in horror and awe. It looked like his real self still enjoyed great fame on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Decker would not have dared attack these strangers if he had known of this before.</p>

  <p>"Where is this man on the Night View Island now?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Decker shook his head again. "I don't know. But I guess he's somewhere in the Ghost Mountain. All truly powerful figures on the Night View Island are over there and this master is no exception."</p>

  <p>"In that case, it's time for us to go," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suggested.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes swept the outside of the cave. She flicked two of her fingers and two tiny shadows appeared at her fingertips. These were energy parasites transformed from the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>She stuffed them into Decker's and Graham's mouths and warned them,</p>

  <p>"Tell your people to behave themselves."</p>

  <p>The energy parasites would keep moving in their bodies. It would take at least three months for the energy to be depleted. During this time, the Snake Goddess could cause them to explode with just a thought if she thought Decker and Graham were out of line.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Wooden Leaf race had long since laid siege outside the cave. They had bows and arrows in their hands, strong auras of Treacherous Beings emanating from their arrows, and ready to launch their attacks.</p>

  <p>"Everyone! Please put down your weapons!" Decker shouted.</p>

  <p>But nobody heeded him. Decker's prestige was not enough to order them around.</p>

  <p>Graham took a deep sigh and said, "Put down your weapons. They are not someone you can match. Don't bring disaster upon our race."</p>

  <p>The leader of the Wooden Leaf race had realized that their whole race would not be a match for this group of humans. Decker should never have provoked them.</p>
