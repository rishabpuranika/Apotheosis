<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Standing tall and proud, the structure of the Tower of Illusory was almost identical to the Tower of Sin which Luo Zheng had entered.</p>

  <p>Many core disciples of the Celestial Position race were fighting in combat in the Tower of Illusory. The rules, however, weren't as cruel as the rules in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>It was believed that a treasure like the Tower of Sin could drive almost all of the races to insanity if it would be placed in a great world, because the competition was too intense, and weak races would surely crumble under the brunt of its cruel rules.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and the others entered, all heads turned to them in curiosity and intrigue.</p>

  <p>The new disciples of the Celestial Position race shared the same thoughts and knew that this group of monsters was here to humiliate them.</p>

  <p>Another difference between the two towers was that the list on the Tower of Illusory's Talent Tablet was comparably longer than the list on the Tower of Sin's Talent Tablet. It was because this tower had always been in the Upper World and had never been lost.</p>

  <p>The list of names at the top of the Talent Tablet didn't change very often.</p>

  <p>It would usually take over hundreds of years for someone to obtain a title.</p>

  <p>However, in the short span of a few days, different titles appeared at the top of the list one after another.</p>

  <p>A string of golden titles lined up on the list in a blinding light, illuminating the tower.</p>

  <p>The core disciples weren't surprised. In fact, they expected it. They thought if the top ten martial artists of the younger generation of the universe couldn't obtain a title, then who else could?</p>

  <p>This time, it was Luo Zheng who led a group of people into the Tower of Illusory.</p>

  <p>Almost all of these core disciples had participated in the Illusion Battlefield, and many of them had even managed to enter the second stage. Of course, they knew who the person walking in front of them was. After all, Luo Zheng was number one in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng also changed his blood. I wonder what sort of title he'll get."</p>

  <p>"I've heard that Luo Zheng was accepted by the Celestial Position race long ago."</p>

  <p>"But he did not enter the Tower of Illusory before..."</p>

  <p>Only a few higher ranks in the Celestial Position race knew what kind of title Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the number of martial artists that followed him increased tenfold as he ascended the floors of the Tower of Illusory. When he reached the tenth floor, the sea of martial artists walking behind him nearly took up all of the space of the entire floor.</p>

  <p>Under everyone's watchful gaze, Luo Zheng opened the door and entered the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Zheng was unwilling to enter the Talent Tablet, but since he had come, he decided to take it seriously.</p>

  <p>When he entered the Talent Tablet, everyone held their breath and wondered what kind of title he'd receive.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you are the best," Mu Ning told Luo Zheng, eager to encourage him. She was full of confidence that Luo Zheng could do this.</p>

  <p>Nathan kept his mouth shut. He had the golden Asura title, and in his opinion, even though Luo Zheng had defeated him, his talent couldn't be stronger than his.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Xenia just watched quietly. Unlike the others, the both of them knew more.</p>

  <p>For example, they knew that Zheng's blood was currently the most special out of all the blood present in the tower. There were only two copies of the golden blood in the entire universe. One of them had been used by Master Feng while the last one had been injected into Zheng's body. But they could not foresee what title Luo Zheng would obtain.</p>

  <p>"It could be a golden Celestial Position title," Xenia whispered, not knowing that this title had been with Luo Zheng for a long time.</p>

  <p>After approximately fifteen minutes had passed, Luo Zheng left the Talent Tablet and turned over his shoulder to look.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's conjectures, the title on the Talent Tablet should not have changed at all. It should still be a golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>At a fast speed, golden-colored spots began to appear on the Talent Tablet. As the spots changed, they formed into large golden words.</p>

  <p>The words on the Talent Tablet were in fact an evaluation from the weapon spirit trapped within the tower.</p>

  <p>During the early stages of the tower's construction, a very special race was sealed within it. They were called the Heavenly Soul race.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Soul race was a very common race in the divine land, and many powerful weapons had weapon spirits within them. If they were allowed to have their own consciousness, then they could probably make weapons more spiritual.</p>

  <p>Notably, the soul of Lone's broken sword belonged to the Heavenly Soul race.</p>

  <p>The weapon spirit's evaluation was also according to an instruction handed in by the owner of the tower. It was the sole responsibility of the weapon spirit to give different evaluations according to the performances.</p>

  <p>But this time, the weapon spirit gave him a rather strange title.</p>

  <p>The words were written in gold, but the line of the words that was displayed on the Talent Tablet caused the onlookers, including several Godly Geniuses, to stare in shock, befuddled. The words said, 'You are the only one.'</p>

  <p>"What kind of a title is this?"</p>

  <p>"How the fuck can this be a title?"</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong with this lousy tower? Or is there something wrong with the weapon spirit inside?"</p>

  <p>Honestly speaking, had a golden Celestial Position title appeared on the Talent Tablet, everyone wouldn't be this dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>For the number one warrior in the younger generation to obtain the title of golden Celestial Position was not something unacceptable or unspeakable. On the contrary, it was actually very common and normal.</p>

  <p>However, many people were not able to decipher the meaning of these words, including Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Xenia's eyes widened as she stared at the large words flashing in gold. In her mind, she guessed that the weapon spirit probably couldn't give him a higher title, so it gave him an evaluation instead.</p>

  <p>What did it mean by Luo Zheng was the only one? Did it mean he was an irreplaceable existence? This evaluation was quite high.</p>

  <p>She flickered her gaze to Luo Zheng who could only stare at her in confusion.</p>

  <p>She softened and said, "It might be due to the blood."</p>

  <p>"Blood..." Luo Zheng murmured, placing a hand on the skin above his heart.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Xenia's reminder, Luo Zheng was hit by a strike of epiphany, and he seemed to have finally understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>The blood he exchanged was indeed very special. Was that why this weapon spirit gave him such an evaluation? Xenia's analysis might be correct after all.</p>

  <p>However, this weapon spirit was too straightforward.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the news of Luo Zheng obtaining such a strange title spread like wildfire in and out of the tower.</p>

  <p>Many core disciples had already left the Tower of Illusory, and after hearing this news, they all rushed back to see it with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he felt like an outsider.</p>

  <p>His mind was focused on his cultivation and accompanying his women.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie was arranged to stay in the fairy palace, Luo Zheng would bring her and Geoffrey out from time to time to bond and have fun.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, more days passed. Luo Zheng had no idea how difficult the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was. There weren't any news from Master Feng in the past two months.</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords in the universe maintained their steady communication with each other. They were still going after the remnants of the sorcerer race, because although their plans were destroyed by Luo Zheng, a few of their supreme sorcerers still remained, and only the Supreme Lords were strong enough to fight them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng hadn't felt this peaceful in a while. Whenever he got tired from his cultivation, he'd go out and accompany Ning Yudie and Geoffrey or joke with Mu Ning, who was always by his side. He felt so comfortable and serene that he considered living this kind of life for a hundred or even a thousand years.</p>

  <p>It was such a shame that he had to face the crisis soon enough.</p>

  <p>That was why some people called their generation a tragedy.</p>

  <p>In this era, all sorts of super geniuses had appeared. The strength of the younger generation had also advanced by leaps and bounds, and their progresses were countless times faster than before!</p>

  <p>In the far past, however, if a warrior did not pursue advancement, then he could enjoy life once he reached the Soul Sea Realm. Afterward, he could live for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>In this case, it wouldn't be a pity for them to fall into the Five Aging Processes in the end.</p>

  <p>But now, that huge danger was like a knife placed around his neck. All the living creatures in the universe were worried for their safety. There was simply no time to think about the luxuries of life.</p>

  <p>Despite this, the core disciples of the Celestial Position race were still very active.</p>

  <p>In fact, this time, when the sorcerer race suddenly orchestrated an attack, there were already countless rumors spreading throughout the supreme worlds. Many martial artists began to spread the theory of the apocalypse.</p>

  <p>Those martial artists who were struggling suddenly realized that they no longer had the motivation to advance. Disciples of many sacred places also stopped being active, refusing to advance even in their dreams. All of them had lost their hopes and passion.</p>

  <p>The apocalypse was about to arrive soon anyway, so what was the point?</p>

  <p>These martial artists didn't even have the qualifications to struggle in the apocalypse. Why not enjoy the last bits of this short period of time?</p>

  <p>In the same span of time, Zheng's inner world had undergone another change as he cultivated.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate of the inner world was much different from the time flow rate of the outside.</p>

  <p>Actually, in this current stage, Zheng's inner world still lacked a complete concept of time. In theory, the time flow rate of his inner world should be countless times faster compared to the time flow rate of the universe.</p>

  <p>As he trained and developed himself further, Luo Zheng occasionally used his inner sight to look around. He discovered that some of the more complex life forms had already been born within his inner world.</p>

  <p>As he looked inside, he noticed that the chaotic sea was teeming with creatures. There were even many giant fishes that slowly swam under the lapping waves.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of cultivation, after the owner of the inner world died, the creatures within would immediately dissipate into a mass of life vitality. Even a True God was no exception.</p>

  <p>The only one who could surpass this rule was most likely a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>But even a Holy Being wouldn't be able to bring out any living being from their inner world. It was simply impossible. Leaving the inner world of a Holy Being was crossing the heavens and leaving the universe. Only these Godly Geniuses could do such an impossible feat. If a Supreme Lord were to forcefully leave this universe, they would die and turn into the life vitality in an instant.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, while he was swimming in his own thoughts, a little fish suddenly materialized in Zheng's hand.</p>
