<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even Yellow Thearch himself was afraid of the power of the Life and Death Holy Way.</p>

  <p>The power of the Life and Death Holy Way was outrageous and overpowering. Whoever stepped into the way would voluntarily walk towards their doom.</p>

  <p>There wasn't a trace of struggle nor hope...</p>

  <p>They all appeared to be willing to step into destruction and die on their own.</p>

  <p>It was more like a mysterious type of Other Shore Token than a kind of bloodline power.</p>

  <p>If Yellow Thearch himself accidentally stepped into it, he would be killed as well.</p>

  <p>Despite the danger it held, the Life and Death Holy Way was Yellow Thearch's most powerful trump card.</p>

  <p>This time, he used this trump card to face the Evil God without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Evil God walked slowly along the void like a lifeless puppet.</p>

  <p>His body quickly turned into wisps of black smoke and gradually dissolved.</p>

  <p>He deteriorated from the outside–starting from the locks of his hair down to his flesh and blood. After a short while, only his skeleton was left moving forward. In the end, the skeleton also vanished into a black line.</p>

  <p>"He really died just like that?" Divine Farmer said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No one could survive once they step into the Life and Death Holy Way," said Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>"Could I resist it?" Othniel asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"With your physical body, you might be able to walk a little further along the way, but you still couldn't escape death," Yellow Thearch replied with certainty.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the Evil God died this way," Divine Farmer said regretfully.</p>

  <p>According to the Eye Spirit, it would have been best if they controlled the Evil God.</p>

  <p>But he didn't expect Yellow Thearch's Life and Death Holy Way to be so powerful that it could kill the Evil God so soon.</p>

  <p>On the black ship, the former captain and Shera stared blankly into space as their eyes were filled with horror.</p>

  <p>Had the Evil God been killed by Yellow Thearch?</p>

  <p>They bargained it was too early to draw such a conclusion.</p>

  <p>Previously, when the Evil God merged Godly Ways, he had avoided the explosion of the Maximized Energy. He had also appeared in front of them safe and sound.</p>

  <p>The problem was, this time, the Evil God walked the Life and Death Holy Way. They had clearly seen his body dissipate bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Edna was left speechless as she stood on the deck.</p>

  <p>She didn't know what had happened, but she was more than sure that the Evil God was still alive!</p>

  <p>"Shall we leave?" Shera asked the captain in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The captain smiled hesitantly. "It's too late to leave now."</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>He began to stroke the Descending Ring gently.</p>

  <p>Facing Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Othniel, they could only place their hopes on the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>When the former captain of the Black Ship entered the Other Shore earlier, he found no one in the Amber Cave. The Grandmaster of Heaven would not be able to descend.</p>

  <p>The illusory space began to disperse.</p>

  <p>Othniel once again hid his huge figure in space.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer flew over and approached the front of the black ship.</p>

  <p>"Long time no see. How have you been, captain?" Yellow Thearch greeted with a smile.</p>

  <p>In the battle with the Pear Hill, the Black Ship suddenly appeared and took away Usman, which came as a staggering blow to the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>This caused a great grudge between them.</p>

  <p>The former captain of the Black Ship cupped his hands towards Yellow Thearch. "In only a few months, your strength has improved greatly. Even I feel inferior to you now," he commended.</p>

  <p>The smile on Yellow Thearch's face grew even wider. "You are so modest.</p>

  <p>I still want to spar with you. I hope you can give me some advice."</p>

  <p>"I'm really no match for you," the captain said bluntly, waiting for Yellow Thearch to read between the lines. 'If you want to kill me, just do it, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As Yellow Thearch heard this, the smile on his face faded. He said directly, "I can let go of the Black Ship, but you have to hand over the Descending Rings in your hands."</p>

  <p>Last time, he had suffered a lot and almost died when Claire descended into his body.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization's unique method of summoning powerful warriors from the Other Shore had a bad side effect.</p>

  <p>If he obtained the Descending Rings, he would be able to summon the Other Shore creatures, saving him a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>"If you had only asked for something else, we would have tried our best to satisfy you. But if it's about the Descending Rings, sorry, it's nonnegotiable," the captain said firmly.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer said directly, "If we kill you, the Black Ship will be destroyed and the Descending Rings will still fall into our hands."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you try?" the captain provoked.</p>

  <p>He and Shera were very much aware that they would have to fight to death here.</p>

  <p>Just as the two sides were talking, a guard on the city wall of the Moon Shield City suddenly fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The guard trembled as he lay like he was suffering from a seizure.</p>

  <p>"Payton, what's happening to you?" Several guards rushed over and attended to him.</p>

  <p>One of the guards helped him up and saw that his face was distorted.</p>

  <p>The muscles on his face were contracting as if an invisible hand was kneading his flesh!</p>

  <p>After the contractions stopped, Payton's face returned. The guard who supported him was suddenly startled and reflexively pushed him away.</p>

  <p>"You-you're not Payton! Who are you?" he shouted.</p>

  <p>It was not Payton's face. It was a face of malice.</p>

  <p>The other guards all pulled out their weapons and surrounded the Evil God.</p>

  <p>They all thought that a spell had been cast unto Payton.</p>

  <p>The Evil God completely ignored them. He took a step forward and floated towards the black ship.</p>

  <p>Just as Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were about to fight the captain, the Evil God suddenly appeared from the other side of the black ship.</p>

  <p>"Your opponent is me," he said with a cynical smile.</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer instantly froze.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer also secretly glanced at Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch stared back at him. What did that suspicious look mean?</p>

  <p>"How could it be? I had clearly just killed you!" Yellow Thearch said angrily.</p>

  <p>The Evil God shrugged. "Yes, you killed me, but that doesn't mean I can't be revived."</p>

  <p>"How did you come back to life?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?" the Evil God mocked him with a smirk.</p>

  <p>"Well then, I'll have to kill you again!"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch raised his sword. Several more lines silently swept towards the Evil God's feet.</p>

  <p>Evil God didn't dodge and once again fell into the Life and Death Holy Way.</p>

  <p>He walked towards one direction as his head dropped. Black smoke started to emit from his body. His skin, flesh, and bones slowly evaporated into thin air once again.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch was excited to watch it happen all over again. He believed that his strongest skill could successfully kill the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He stood on the black ship and looked around, trying to see if the Evil God resurrected.</p>

  <p>Shera also inspected the surroundings as she was also curious. How could the Evil God come back to life?</p>

  <p>The captain smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>He used to be one of the big shots in the chaos, but now he seemed to be excluded and ignored.</p>

  <p>Among these people, the weakest one was Edna. She leaned against the rail calmly and didn't look worried at all.</p>

  <p>Not long after, another guard had a seizure on the city wall of the Moon Shield City. As his entire body twisted and turned, he transformed into the Evil God. He waved at the Black Ship above and shouted, "Hey, I'm here!"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch's eyes flashed with anger as he was about to rush down.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer took his place ahead of him. "Let me finish him!"</p>

  <p>As Divine Farmer swooped down, his bloodline was activated.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he turned into a monster with a goat's head, a tiger's body, and a bull's hooves. A layer of dark black crystal covered his entire body.</p>

  <p>This was his fourth form! It was also his most powerful one!</p>

  <p>With his current physical strength, he was confident to fight anyone head-on.</p>

  <p>After reaching the city wall, he opened his mouth wide and snatched the Evil God. He chewed forcibly for a few times before swallowing his sudden meal.</p>

  <p>Just after Divine Farmer swallowed, another guard's entire body twitched from a distance. A brand new Evil God was now looking slyly at Divine Farmer. With arms crossed, he tapped his fingertips rhythmically as if he was waiting for a next move.</p>
