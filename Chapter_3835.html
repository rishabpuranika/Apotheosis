  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the boy was only a step away from him, Luo Zheng finally felt that something was wrong, and turned his head in confusion.</p>

  <p>Yet, there was nothing behind him.</p>

  <p>He frowned as his confusion grew.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"It seems that something is following me," Luo Zheng answered. He sniffed and sensed a cold aura that floated around him.</p>

  <p>"This place is a bit strange. You must be careful," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded him.</p>

  <p>No one had ever entered this world until Luo Zheng. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was not sure what was ahead of them, so he could only remind Luo Zheng to be careful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. Just as he was about to take another step forward, the cold aura suddenly intensified.</p>

  <p>He quickly turned around and saw the little boy's crumbling face. The little boy opened his bloody mouth, and the cracks at the corners of his mouth extended to his ears. His teeth were as sharp as a beast's tusks. Black saliva, which smelled strongly of blood, dripped from them like threads.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" Luo Zheng roared.</p>

  <p>Such an ugly and disgusting face startled him so much that he subconsciously punched the little boy.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch of about forty thousand Jun landed on the little boy and disfigured his face and mouth. The force also twisted his body so horribly that it looked like braided dough, then sent it flying several hundred feet away before it crashed on the ground.</p>

  <p>'Why is there a monster in the form of little boy in this damned place?' Luo Zheng wondered as he moved towards where the boy fell.</p>

  <p>The punch smashed the boy's body into a pulp. Luo Zheng was sure that he was dead.</p>

  <p>Upon closer look at the pit, however, he was shocked.</p>

  <p>There was only a twisted piece of human skin left in the pit. It was the boy's skin.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Zheng muttered with a frown.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, he felt a gust of coldness behind him again. When he turned around, he saw many little boys who stood not far away, dispersed around.</p>

  <p>All of their mouths were cracked to their ears and revealed their sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>At the same time, their eyes glistened with a strange light.</p>

  <p>However, the light didn't seem to be malicious, but more of mocking.</p>

  <p>"Is this place suitable for you?</p>

  <p>Can you stay here?</p>

  <p>Come with me..."</p>

  <p>The little boys spoke simultaneously and repeated the same thing. "Are you real?" Luo Zheng asked with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>No one answered him. As the little boys repeated their words, they opened their big mouths and rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng slightly shook his hand when one of the little boys had neared him.</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand Jun of force instantly gathered on his fist.</p>

  <p>Then he punched the little boy, and the boy's body twisted and flew far away.</p>

  <p>He knew that it would be hard to get the origin-level bloodline, but so far, the difficulties he faced were nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Although the little boys had horrible faces and strange auras, they were not that strong.</p>

  <p>As they continued to get close, Luo Zheng threw punches at them.</p>

  <p>Every single time, his punches sent the weak-bodied little boys flying with twisted bodies.</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Zheng attacked, he went to the spot where the little boys' bodies fell, and looked into the pits. Just like before, only pieces of human skin remained.</p>

  <p>After he got rid of all the little boys, he took a short break. Suddenly, he felt a strong wind of cold air behind him.</p>

  <p>More boys with unusual facial expressions appeared. This time, there were about four thousand of them, and they all looked at Luo Zheng with a strange glint in their eyes.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng became serious. This world was certainly real and not an illusion. The current situation was a little alarming. Although these little boys weren't powerful, what if they just kept increasing?</p>

  <p>Then, the little boys rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>A cyan feather appeared above his head. His body became light and nimble, as he flew forward. He had already slipped away before those boys could approach him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When some of them caught up with him, Luo Zheng slapped their bodies to clear his way. However, more boys appeared every time he killed one of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he stopped attacking and used his nimble bodily movement skill to travel instead.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the thousands of little boys behind him drooped their heads and repeated, "Is this place suitable for you? Can you stay here? Come with me..."</p>

  <p>Then, the large crowd followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>While he ran, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned around to look, his face twisted into a thoughtful expression.</p>

  <p>Since the inheritance of the bloodline took place in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he figured that the four origin-level bloodlines that the fox girl had mentioned must also be in here; there must be a reason why these little boys had appeared.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be the end of this world!" Luo Zheng suddenly said and disrupted the Primeval Lord of Heaven's thoughts.</p>

  <p>The desolate world he was in was small. He only ran for a short distance, but he reached the end.</p>

  <p>At the end of this world was a large bronze wall, and there was a crack filled with numerous white dots of light in the center of the wall. The dots were light dots from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, Luo Zheng was now in the Abstruse Energy World after he had traveled through the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, someone had forcefully created a space in the Abstruse Energy World with the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>In that space, creatures from the chaos could move around freely.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng rushed to the bronze wall, he discovered that there were Sanskrit words on both sides of the crack. "Can you decipher them?" Luo Zheng asked the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>Even though the place was too weird, Luo Zheng tried out every possible way to get useful information.</p>

  <p>"Yes," a voice came from the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>In Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's core began to operate. Soon enough, it deciphered the Sanskrit words on the left. It said: "The origin-level bloodline will reproduce to the limit, then it can be acquired."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned when he heard those words. "Reproduce to the limit?</p>

  <p>What kind of bloodline is that?"</p>

  <p>"I see," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said after a moment of contemplation.</p>

  <p>When he thought about the little boys, he immediately realized what had happened. "The bloodline in this deserted world is this infinitely multiplied bloodline. It means that after a person with this bloodline dies, there will be even more of them. Those little boys' words mean something," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Is this place suitable for you? Can you stay here? Come with me..."</p>

  <p>"Is this place suitable for you?</p>

  <p>Stay here..."</p>

  <p>Those little boys finally caught up and each of them spoke clearly. They were not the creatures of this world, but the bloodline itself.</p>

  <p>"After its death, it will still reproduce fast. It is an extremely powerful bloodline!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's eyes glinted. He didn't describe such a bloodline as strong, but rather a dishonest method.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe he could really "infinitely reproduce" if he inherited this bloodline. However, thinking about copies of him fighting by his side, he couldn't doubt the power this bloodline would bring him.</p>
