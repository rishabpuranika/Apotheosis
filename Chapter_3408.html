<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The force of fear swept like tidal waves over the Evil God.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God struggled, bombarded by the full force of fear, his face twisted with pain and terror.</p>

  <p>The force of fear was a special form of soul attack. Even the strongest souls had flawed hearts, and the force inevitably found the flaw and used it to release all the fear in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Despite the rapid increase in the force of fear that attacked him, the Evil God managed to hold on for several seconds before he collapsed onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The relationship between the races in the cave was a little complicated, but they all had one thing in common. Everyone hated the Evil God to the core.</p>

  <p>Thus, the sight of the Evil God falling to the ground should have made them clap their hands and cheer. On the contrary, however, everyone was silent.</p>

  <p>Some looked solemn, while others wore expressions of deep wariness.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had a powerful soul, but he couldn't resist the force of fear.</p>

  <p>How could they reach the upper part of the main peak?</p>

  <p>After a while, the red light vanished.</p>

  <p>Being punished by the force of fear, the Evil God finally calmed down after managing to stand up.</p>

  <p>He said nothing, but his face was etched with grimness. He looked around him with eyes filled with suspicion and doubt.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had seldom been beaten since he entered the Source World.</p>

  <p>He did not know who had employed the force of fear, but he vowed that he would find out and take his revenge.</p>

  <p>"The force of fear is so strong. We are no match for whoever employed it.</p>

  <p>How can we continue to climb up?" someone asked in a worried tone.</p>

  <p>Mount replied, "Even if we manage to climb up, we will find it difficult to defeat those Chaotic Source Spirits if we are suppressed by the force of fear."</p>

  <p>The main peak was very dangerous to climb, even without taking any other factors into considerations. They also had the Chaotic Source Spirits to contend with. After these spirits swallowed each other, their strength increased significantly, and they posed a huge risk for anyone who dared to climb the main peak.</p>

  <p>"We can't return empty-handed," someone said gloomily.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent, wondering what would be the best course of action.</p>

  <p>Yan had said that if they missed this opportunity, it would be impossible for any of them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm in the future.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to turn back at this point without anything to show for it.</p>

  <p>As they discussed the matter, they were interrupted by a sharp, cracking sound.</p>

  <p>They looked up. The sound was coming from the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>The sculptures on the roof of the cave seemed to have gotten loose, and cracks had appeared on the surface. Three staircases extended down from where the cracks had appeared.</p>

  <p>The base of one of the staircases was right next to the huddled disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Zheng quickly went to the staircase and took a few steps up. He peered towards the top of the staircase, trying to see what lay ahead.</p>

  <p>But it was dark and shadowed. No one could see what was there.</p>

  <p>Like Zheng, everyone else was craning their necks, trying to get a look at the top of the stairs. However, no one but Zheng had dared to place a foot on the steps. They weren't willing to risk facing whatever was up there.</p>

  <p>While they could only see darkness, they correctly sensed that some great danger lay in wait.</p>

  <p>Everyone present was well-versed in the nature and tactics of fighting.</p>

  <p>While they didn't know what exactly the Chaotic Source Spirits were thinking, they could just imagine what they would suffer if they rashly marched up unprepared for what they were about to face.</p>

  <p>The Evil God immediately knew what everyone was thinking. He stood still, looking around with a mocking smile. He said to everyone through his life vitality, "Like the rest of you, I don't know what's up there, but since they have invited us, it won't be difficult to find out."</p>

  <p>Zheng, Mya, Khalid, Hamzah and the others frowned. Mya stepped towards the Evil God and said in a low voice, "How can you say that after you were tortured by the force of fear?"</p>

  <p>Mya and the rest of them knew how to fight visible enemies. They could defeat them effortlessly.</p>

  <p>After all, they all had powerful Other Shore Tokens. Even if they encountered stronger masters at the Other Shore Realm, they still had a fair chance to win any battle.</p>

  <p>For example, the Evil God was powerful, but when the four members of the Separate Abyss race fought him together, he succumbed under their combined strength. This was the magic of the Other Shore Tokens. If their abilities were combined perfectly, the power released would be increased tenfold or even a hundredfold.</p>

  <p>But the top of the main peak held an enemy whose power was completely unfamiliar to them. The one attack they were sure to face, the force of fear, was something they couldn't resist. They were certain that if they went up right now, they would just end up getting killed.</p>

  <p>"If you think it's too dangerous to go up from here, maybe we can go up on the outside," the Evil God suggested.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors here were more used to following orders than thinking outside the box. They wanted to break through inside the main peak.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was another way up. They could fly to the top of the main peak outside.</p>

  <p>At the Evil God's suggestion, many began nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>"The hurricane outside is very strong," Mya objected.</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced at Mya and asked, "Haven't you ever dug holes in the ground?"</p>

  <p>Many creatures present had dug holes all the way from the edge of the Chaotic Source World, so they naturally understood what the Evil God was trying to say.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of here," Khalid proposed.</p>

  <p>This time, even more people nodded vigorously. The Evil God's plan was better than the alternative. They were prepared to do as they were told.</p>

  <p>In order to get the Chaotic Source Spirits, all of them had formed a temporary, tenuous alliance with each other, forming one large and unified group.</p>

  <p>The Evil God laughed. "But there is another way! It is more simple, and it is the one I prefer."</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Zheng, stared at the Evil God in puzzlement and exasperation. They wondered what trick he was playing now.</p>

  <p>"The main peak is very long and narrow in diameter. It's high, but not very bulky, so if we work together, we might be able to break it. What do you think?" the Evil God asked slyly.</p>

  <p>Everyone began speaking at once, looking surprised at the Evil God's solution. "Break the main peak?"</p>

  <p>"What a bold idea! Do the people of the Pear Hill agree?"</p>

  <p>"As they said, this is the last time the Chaotic Source World opens, and there will be no Chaotic Source Spirits in the future. Who cares if we break the main peak?"</p>

  <p>They quickly grasped that getting to the top from the outside was only a slightly better choice than just going up the stairs. In either case, they would still be passively entering an unknown situation.</p>

  <p>It was definitely a much better choice to break the main peak directly.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to look questioningly at the people of the Pear Hill. Before Yan could speak, Natalie said with a shrug, "Our masters didn't tell us specifically what to do. They let us play it by ear."</p>

  <p>Hamzah said, "In that case, we can do as he said. But... I wonder if there is a hurricane outside now?"</p>

  <p>He thought breaking the main peak was an excellent plan, but he worried that everyone would just be swept away by the hurricane if they did that.</p>

  <p>"Some of my clansmen keep watch outside," said a nonhuman creature covered in something green. "The hurricane will stop at any moment."</p>

  <p>Seeing that everyone was eager for action, the Evil God smirked. "Then let's get started. Remember, we only have one chance to do this right."</p>

  <p>The Evil God and the others had all been conversing through their life vitality, so the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the giant eye at the top couldn't hear them.</p>

  <p>The giant eye was narrowed in doubt. Through its consciousness, it said,</p>

  <p>"What are they waiting for? Why don't they go up the stairs?"</p>

  <p>"They are cowards," said the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits contemptuously. Firmly she added, "But they won't give up this opportunity."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the pupil of the giant eye suddenly shrank.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!"</p>

  <p>The scarlet force of fear spiraled in the pupil. However, before it could be released, a violent roar came from below.</p>

  <p>The crowd eager to get to the top was comprised of a powerful and diverse group of warriors. Their combined power could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Most of them could control a level of strength up to one thousand divine megatons. Some could easily control an even greater level of strength, especially those from the Separate Abyss race. By virtue of their perfect bodies, even if they did not reach the Chaotic Source Realm, the strength they exerted was comparable to that of the said realm.</p>

  <p>A rumbling sound echoed as the main peak trembled.</p>

  <p>A second later, the middle part of the main peak suddenly shook violently, as though it was being torn by an earthquake.</p>
