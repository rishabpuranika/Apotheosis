<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>They were so close to the other side but the previously knocked-down Lava Giant had now gotten up and was following them again!</p>

  <p>The creature might be gigantic but it wasn't slow. If it caught up to them, then the Lava Giant currently carrying them would tumble into the lava.</p>

  <p>"Thump, thump, thump..."</p>

  <p>The pursuing giant's thumping footsteps made everyone's hearts lurch to their throats.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey raised the Buddha Curse Blade parallel to his eye as he tried to measure the distance between them and the shore.</p>

  <p>A wry smile was on his face as he put the sword down.</p>

  <p>"We're only 6, 000 feet away from the shore! It's close but not close enough for us to jump over."</p>

  <p>A high-levelled warrior had the ability to fly in the air.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, flying was prohibited in the Hall of Causality. That ability would've made things a thousand times easier if it had been allowed.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, jumping was still permitted and a Soul Sea Realm warrior's leap was no small matter.</p>

  <p>A single jump would mean crossing over 2, 000 feet of distance. A higher vantage point on top of the Lava Giant's head also gave them a bit more advantage.</p>

  <p>However, a total of 6, 000 feet was too much.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they only had one chance to make it to shore. Falling into the lava would mean instant elimination.</p>

  <p>"Coleman, can you jump over?" Ansel asked.</p>

  <p>Ogres mainly cultivated the body refining technique, but the explosive power of their forceful energy was much greater. Combining the two, Coleman was surely someone who could jump longer than the average warrior.</p>

  <p>Coleman took a quick calculative glance towards the other side and bitterly shook his head. "I can't!"</p>

  <p>His answer worried everyone greatly. They were so close to the other side. Was it all going to be for nothing? No! They refused to believe that!</p>

  <p>"Can you all jump a distance of 3, 000 feet?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey's eyes flashed. "That should be the limit."</p>

  <p>"I can," Hailey answered.</p>

  <p>Janet nodded. "If I go all out, I think I can make it... Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned and saw the Lava Giant inching its way closer to them. With no time to explain, he simply turned to his team members. "When I say the word, you guys jump to the left!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng walked to the side of the Lava Giant's head and squatted down.</p>

  <p>As he was squatting, Luo Luo Zheng began to draw out the power of the dragon scales, and directed it all the way to his legs!</p>

  <p>A distance of 6, 000 feet wasn't possible to ordinary warriors, but it was nothing for someone like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He's going to directly jump over!"</p>

  <p>"He must be crazy! The distance is too far!"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget his power..." Janet murmured faintly as a reminder.</p>

  <p>Back when they had just passed the second hall, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to obtain 10 million Illusion Points just from his strength alone.</p>

  <p>It hurt to admit it but just his pure strength was already several times more powerful than any of their hidden trump cards.</p>

  <p>If he utilized his power to jump then, there was no doubt that 6, 000 feet wouldn't be too difficult for him.</p>

  <p>But what if he was the only one who made it to shore?</p>

  <p>This question greatly upset the others.</p>

  <p>They were a team and though it was only temporary, it still hurt to know that Luo Luo Zheng would be the only one to get through this hall.</p>

  <p>But then he did say something earlier. Jump to the left?</p>

  <p>What did that mean? Just as everyone thought of this, Luo Zheng's activation was nearly finished and he was getting ready to make his leap.</p>

  <p>The power in his legs caused two deep footprints to embed themselves on the Lava Giant's head. When he felt he was finally ready, he launched himself off and jumped!</p>

  <p>As he flew through the air, a small mountain spun in his hand! The Magnetic Sacred Mountain!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>He threw the mountain into the lava lake below.</p>

  <p>But this seemingly casual action had been done with precision!</p>

  <p>Ordinary molten lava was not enough to destroy this Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>In fact, this was what was going to solve their current dilemma of crossing over to the other side. The mountain was going to serve as their foothold to finally pass through the lava lake...</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng crossed over a distance of 6, 000 feet in just a blink of an eye and landed heavily on the shore.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing did it!"</p>

  <p>"But it seems that we will die here!"</p>

  <p>Janet shouted in resentment. They all went through so much together only for him to abandon them at the most crucial moment.</p>

  <p>"Thump! Thump! Thump..."</p>

  <p>The pursuing Lava Giant wasn't too far from them now. It could smash its huge body onto the one carrying them, and that would lead to an unimaginably powerful collision which they would, unfortunately, be caught in the middle of.</p>

  <p>At that moment Luo Luo Zheng, who was already onshore, suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>This greatly confused them.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean..."</p>

  <p>"Plop..."</p>

  <p>Just then, the lava lake began to bubble violently.</p>

  <p>The thick surface of the lava rose as if there was an enormous mass pushing from below.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a mountain peak broke through and began to emerge from the molten surface!</p>

  <p>It was the Magnetic Sacred Mountain! Luo Luo Zheng was controlling it and letting it grow to its original size.</p>

  <p>The sight amazed everyone.</p>

  <p>Even Janet's formerly disappointed face lit up in joy.</p>

  <p>"The Magnetic Sacred Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"It looks like the small mountain Tianxing played with in the past!"</p>

  <p>"How did it get so big?"</p>

  <p>Everyone's mouth hung open in shock as they stared at the mountain in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>However, they quickly shook themselves out of their reverie once they realized the purpose that this mountain could serve for them.</p>

  <p>"Jump!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shouted. The mountain was now their first foothold from which they could make their second jump towards the shore.</p>

  <p>"I'll jump!"</p>

  <p>Coleman shouted.</p>

  <p>He was originally afraid but now that the forceful energy erupted, his body was now similar to that of an elephant. He launched himself to the air and smashed ruthlessly against the side of the mountain!</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound as Coleman got to his feet and stood in the middle of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. He faced his team members and touched his chest in pride.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey was next, taking two steps back before also launching himself towards the mountain.</p>

  <p>His entire body was like a roc, spreading its wings as it glided through the air. He travelled 3, 000 feet in an instant!</p>

  <p>Hailey and Ansel were next. They lacked Coleman's explosive power and Jeffrey's elegant gliding but their basic body skills still proved to be effective in crossing great distances.</p>

  <p>Seeing her team members make it to the mountain, Janet put away the Lofty Wood in her hand. The Frosty Cage on top of it melted and the branches of the wood started to shrink until they disappeared without a trace. It was now as long as half her arm and quickly drilled into her palm.</p>

  <p>Now out of the Frosty Cage, the previously imprisoned flame kitten had regained its freedom.</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>It looked frightened but it didn't run away. Instead, it stood in its spot, shivering.</p>

  <p>"Jump into the lava now. This place is no longer safe," Janet told the kitten.</p>

  <p>However, the kitten merely stood there and looked at Janet with wide, pitiful eyes.</p>

  <p>Janet frowned and reached out for it...</p>

  <p>The flame kitten was a Law Creature created by the flames. Anyone who touched it was sure to be burnt.</p>

  <p>However, this kitten had been imprisoned in the Frosty Cage for so long and had cold air blown at it by Luo Luo Zheng and the others. Its body had completely lost its luster. Janet also used the life vitality to protect her skin, so it was only partly scalding when she touched the kitten.</p>

  <p>"Be free!" she cried out as she threw the kitten away from the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>The lava was dangerous to them but it was home for this flame kitten.</p>

  <p>"Janet! Jump!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up Janet!"</p>

  <p>Janet nodded and drew out a stream of life vitality. She quickly launched herself and jumped into the air like a nimble skylark.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>She crossed through the air and made her way towards the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>
