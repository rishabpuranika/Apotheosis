  <p>
</p>

  <p>It did not matter now which shadow she descended on because she would be instantly attacked by Zheng. 'Now what?' she thought to herself. In the perspective of Cheryl, this was indeed a difficult decision to ponder upon, given the limitations of her attack.</p>

  <p>Eventually, her silhouette flickered in a moment of desperation as she finally chose the location where Zheng was as her next destination.</p>

  <p>Although Cheryl was not definite about her knowledge on the power of Zheng's flying knife thus far, she could tell with a glance that even though it was broken, its aura was extremely sharp and something that could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Contemplating by herself, she understood that if she had chosen another shadow, she would probably be pierced through by Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was a sacred weapon and there was absolutely no way she would have been able to block it.</p>

  <p>With the limited options she had, she could have only selected the shadow Zheng was dealing with at the moment. Since he had removed the sword in his hand by throwing it at the shadow, she seriously expected that his strength would be greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>This was due to the fact that Cheryl believed in the notion that swordsmen relied on their swords the most. If it ever happened that a swordsman willingly threw his sword out in a battle, then it meant that the man was ultimately prepared to gamble everything he had. Zheng having no sword in his hand meant that she would then have a huge chance of defeating him.</p>

  <p>It was a common conception that a swordsman without a sword was like a tiger with its teeth pulled out.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to Cheryl, she would be in for a surprise when she eventually found out that Zheng was even more terrifying when he did not have his sword.</p>

  <p>Upon the very moment Cheryl descended, she poised herself to face Zheng's fist directly.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Zheng had not bothered to activate the Stellar Body because he did not feel the need to use it to deal with the woman.</p>

  <p>"Split the light!"</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had already launched his punch, Cheryl did not hesitate to counterattack with a move of her own. Her long sword uncoiled and gleamed like a nimble green snake which released a faint azure light, aiming straight at him.</p>

  <p>Although her sword moves did not appear to be powerful enough, every flick of her wrist was definitely exquisite. In addition to this, each of them was able to point at a vital point of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>If Zheng were to use his fist to attack her, he would not be fast enough to land the first hit and she could then chop half his head off.</p>

  <p>Conversely, Zheng's fist did not swing towards Cheryl. Instead, he did the unexpected as his hand changed its direction midway and directly grabbed onto her sword.</p>

  <p>In reality, Cheryl's sword was also a sacred weapon, which was known as "Gentle Snow". Besides possessing the strength of a sacred weapon, it was also abnormally light to the point that it felt relatively weightless. It must have been named after its weight, as grabbing it felt like handling snow in Zheng's perspective.</p>

  <p>After Zheng gripped the blade of her sword between his two fingers, Cheryl frowned as she strained to pull it out of his grip. It was similar to being embedded into a crack in a compact stone, as she falteringly discovered that she was unable to wrench it out at all.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Cheryl was a woman and the members of the Demon Night did not specialize in raw strength, the power of Cheryl, who was a warrior that cultivated both her body and life vitality, was certainly not something ordinary warriors could match. Even if her sword was suppressed by a mountain, she could still be able to pull it out.</p>

  <p>However, Cheryl had tried her best to tug at it twice in succession, even erupting with the forceful energy within her body to no avail. No matter how much she gritted her teeth and the amount of effort made sweat pool on her forehead, the sword in her hand did not budge even a single inch.</p>

  <p>Noticing her struggle and frustration, Zheng merely gave her a lazy grin before squeezing the blade tighter with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Without much effort from Zheng, he broke the sword between his fingers and watched mirthlessly as the mangled pieces resounded upon hitting the floor unceremoniously.</p>

  <p>Seething with indignation and anger, she glared at the man coldly before shrieking, "You!"</p>

  <p>The woman found herself no longer maintaining her calm disposition as she wanted to lash out instead.</p>

  <p>Even though she was a talent of the sacred palace, being able to acquire a powerful sacred weapon was not that easy. Furthermore, the Gentle Snow was the most suitable for her the moment she started practicing her swordsmanship with it. Due to this, she was indeed very fond of the weapon and took good care of it. With shock adorning her features, she had definitely not expected her sword to be broken by Zheng.</p>

  <p>The strength of a sacred weapon was not something an ordinary weapon could be compared to given its outstanding power. It just so happened that Cheryl's sword was too thin and narrow. If he had done the same move on Boris' saber, it would have been more difficult for Zheng to destroy it even if he had activated all of his dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, with Zheng's current prowess, it was not too challenging or difficult for him to break Cheryl's sword apart.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Grinning slyly, Zheng asked the irate woman with an innocent expression.</p>

  <p>"I am going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Glaring at the nonchalant Zheng, Cheryl was furious and a green light suddenly appeared right above her head. As soon as the green light had appeared, it directly inserted itself into her skull.</p>

  <p>With a start, he wiped the smile off his face and stared at her with seriousness because he immediately sensed extreme danger about to happen.</p>

  <p>Considering Zheng's current strength, ordinary war generals would not be able to make him feel this way. Even ordinary war lords never gave him a reason to perceive them as threats.</p>

  <p>When this intense feeling of danger came over him, Zheng abruptly retreated and created a reasonable distance between him and Cheryl. The woman's fingers suddenly emitted a few rays of pitch black light as her nails seemingly extended. In honesty, Zheng was concerned at the sight of the black light and it made him breathe unevenly.</p>

  <p>No matter how confident Zheng was in his fairy weapon-like body, he certainly knew better than to let this woman scratch him with her dangerous looking fingernails.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Cheryl obviously did not plan on letting him go that easily. As she fiercely rushed towards him, she vigorously waved her sharp claws. The scene discernibly looked like a howling lynx facing its prey in the wild.</p>

  <p>Under the continuous pursuit of the outraged lady, the black claws almost scraped Zheng several times but he was still able to dodge them in time. In the middle of scraping through and managing to avoid Cheryl's frontal attack by mere inches, Zheng forgot that her shadows were still in the arena.</p>

  <p>The instant Zheng retreated to another corner of the arena, Cheryl's figure instantly disappeared and materialized in the shadow behind him, about to attack him by surprise.</p>

  <p>"Crap!"</p>

  <p>He knew that the minute he was grazed by this woman, it would be a detrimental blow to him. Even if he did not die, he would be seriously injured from the brunt of her attack. Cursing at himself, he realized just then that he had been too careless this time around.</p>
