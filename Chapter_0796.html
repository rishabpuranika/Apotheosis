<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had underestimated the tricks of the immortal.</p>

  <p>Until now, he had blocked a few attacks by relying heavily on his special body.</p>

  <p>Usually, only very sharp attacks would cause substantial damage to him.</p>

  <p>For example, it was easy to pierce through his body or slice small wounds, but it would be very difficult to tear his body apart.</p>

  <p>Eddie, for example, as the number one warrior in the Central Region, might be able to break a top-grade fairy sword, because the sword was too thin and easily broken. But what if it was a top-grade fairy metal pillar as thick as a bucket?</p>

  <p>Eddie could bore a hole into the metal pillar, but he would not be able to break it.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, his body was equivalent to a top-grade fairy metal pillar. If someone wanted to forcibly break his body, how terrifying would the force be?</p>

  <p>However, this killing force from the immortal was still beyond Zheng's wildest imagination.</p>

  <p>The powerful killing force caused the flesh in Zheng's arm to crack. His bones were harder than steel, but the pressure of this force still caused them to crack.</p>

  <p>What was even more frightening was that this killing force continued to pierce through him. Not only did it attack both of Zheng's arms, it also pierced through his back. It was as if there was a giant invisible hand squeezing Zheng tightly in its palm.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack!</p>

  <p>His spine was cracking under the pressure of the killing force.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Even though she knew that Zheng couldn't resist the immortal's destructive power, Yudie still couldn't help but burst into tears when she saw him struggling.</p>

  <p>Yudie was just an ordinary woman. While it was still true that she practically flew her way up as she was now one of the top warriors in the Central Region, this was never part of her plan. Her warrior spirit started to develop when the Cloud Hall discovered her talents.</p>

  <p>Even then, she yearned for a peaceful life. She wanted someone by her side— someone she could argue with when she was not happy, and someone who would remind her to wear a jacket when it was cold outside.</p>

  <p>Zheng, perhaps, could be the person she was looking for. He could be the man to bring warmth to her life.</p>

  <p>Yudie was devastated to watch Zheng getting killed.</p>

  <p>Other people were in stunned disbelief.</p>

  <p>Everyone's mind was still on Elderly Luna getting killed. They couldn't believe that a warrior at the Life and Death Realm could get killed just like that. His body was crushed as if by an invisible force and it just vanished.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to be relying on his own body to resist that destructive power.</p>

  <p>The immortal's power was something that warriors at the Lower World could not comprehend, nor could they stop.</p>

  <p>In this Wheel of Fortune, the game rules set by Immortal Mist were the solid principles. Since the rules stated that Zheng would be killed, then he must die. Otherwise, the rule of "killing anyone" would be invalid and it would be unfair to the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>However... Zheng was actually resisting that terrifying force.</p>

  <p>"This... This is the power of an immortal, yet Zheng actually still has the power to resist. I'm really scared. Is this guy even a human?" An elder of the Black Mountain Sect could not help but pose this question. He couldn't admit to himself that Zheng was that strong.</p>

  <p>"Damn! How tough is Zheng's body? A strength that could resist an immortal's killing force? Elderly Luna was killed, but Zheng is still alive!"</p>

  <p>"This is unbelievable! What a brat! Could it be that he's more powerful? I'm going crazy! I think he should be dead! How could we explain that a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm could survive all of this?"</p>

  <p>"Look, he's getting weaker. He's going to die soon."</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng were killed, it was still unbelievable. As the warriors watched this scene unfold, they were left speechless. To them, Zheng was a monster that could not be measured by ordinary standards.</p>

  <p>Zheng gnashed his teeth. In order to resist the power, he not only used the power of the dragon scales, but also the forceful energy hidden inside his body.</p>

  <p>However, with the eruption of Zheng's strength, the invisible destructive force seemed to increase its power as well. Originally, after he became a fairy weapon, he could still borrow more power of the dragon scales. But if he did, his body would be unable to bear the combination of the power of the dragon scales, the forceful energy, and the immortal's killing force.</p>

  <p>"Aaaaargh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted in pain. The muscles in his shoulders, chest, and back were all bleeding. Blood spurted out from everywhere, even hitting the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p id="top_6">Yudie touched the enchanted barrier with both her hands— an icy mist surrounding her face. She was hoping that Zheng could wave his magic wand this time too so that he would survive.</p>

  <p>It might be impossible for others, but for Zheng, it wasn't.</p>

  <p>Yudie had witnessed many unexpected miracles happen to Zheng. At that moment, she closed her eyes and wished with all her might that Zheng would survive this whole thing.</p>

  <p>Sadly, the miracle never happened.</p>

  <p>She watched helplessly as more and more blood spurted out from Zheng's body. The bones in his body couldn't stand the pressure and shattered into pieces. His entire body was being kneaded by the giant invisible hand. His body was all mangled and twisted.</p>

  <p>"Bastard, you didn't even save your sister!" Yudie mumbled, the sadness from her face disappearing.</p>

  <p>She was the head of the Cloud Hall, so naturally she had to have both a soft and a hard side.</p>

  <p>The crowd of warriors let out a collective sigh while a handful of them still thought something was not right. Elderly Luna had been completely smashed and vanished. They thought the same thing would happen to Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's mangled corpse never vanished. Was it because his body was so strong that the force couldn't vanish it away?</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, a strange thing happened.</p>

  <p>A light suddenly flashed on Zheng's twisted body as small dots of light exploded from it.</p>

  <p>The dots of light formed a semicircle of light that surrounded Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Soon, a huge wave hit the light curtain.</p>

  <p>Everyone assumed that the killing power of the immortal didn't actually disappear— it was just attacking the light curtain.</p>

  <p>However, the light curtain enveloping Zheng seemed to be even more terrifying. Although it was caved in by the destructive power, the caved area instantly returned to its original state. The light curtain clashed with the invisible hand again.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The light curtain enveloping Zheng began to fight the killing power of the immortal fiercely.</p>

  <p>The whole chasm was shaking because of the two strong forces. The discs where people were standing as well as the walls started to tremble.</p>

  <p>When the warriors at the Life and Death Realm felt the powerful force, their faces turned pale.</p>

  <p>What kind of method did Zheng use to be able to resist the power of an immortal?</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't invent this method. It came from the amulet bestowed upon him by the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace. Like the power of the immortal, it was also a technique from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who lay under the light curtain, looked extremely shocked He never thought that a small amulet was capable of such a strong force.</p>

  <p>In reality, this amulet had become Zheng's substitute. Not only did it take all the damage that Zheng dealt, but it had also helped him completely cancel out the destructive force.</p>

  <p>However, the immortal's killing power was still immensely strong. It wouldn't stop until it killed Zheng.</p>

  <p>The collision continued for a while. The invisible giant hand's strength gradually faded as the chaos started to dissipate.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, the light curtain surrounding Zheng also disintegrated.</p>

  <p>The amulet bestowed by the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace also shattered into pieces. It could not protect him forever as it could only be used one time.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had already gotten up, couldn't be bothered by anything else. He just stared at Yudie and smiled, "Why are you crying?"</p>
