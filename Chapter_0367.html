  <p>
</p>

  <p>Producing magic arrays required the use of array flags.</p>

  <p>A magic array master mainly employed magic arrays during battles.</p>

  <p>However, they could not produce one during the fights. Instead, they prepared it in array flags ahead of time. In that way, when they needed to make one quickly during the fight, all they had to do was to set these array flags in particular places.</p>

  <p>The most efficient way to battle with a magic array master was to prevent him from creating a magic array. Because as soon as the master had successfully made a magic array, he was at an advantage during the fight, and it would be hard to defeat him since an ordinary magic array and a magic killing array were very powerful.</p>

  <p>Yehudi's spear did not stab his opponent, Mack. Unfazed, he stabbed at the black array flag on the ground.</p>

  <p>The black flag appeared to notice Yehudi's motion, and so it released a burst of black fog. The fog rushed at Yehudi rapidly as it tried to cover him.</p>

  <p>The black fog was one of Mack's attack moves through his soul.</p>

  <p>To be precise, Mack did not use the black array flag to make a magic array. The black array flag was much like a defense move. When Yehudi had focused his attention on the black flag and then tried to attack it, it would release black fog to trap him.</p>

  <p>Warriors did not generally allow their opponent to create a magic array in battles. However, the magic array master could use all kinds of methods to fight, and Mack caught Yehudi due to a careless move of Yedudi.</p>

  <p>'Do you really think you can destroy my magic array flag? Dream on!'</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on Mack's face. Soon, he took out other array flags in different colors and put them in different places.</p>

  <p>At the time, Yehudi was already struggling against the first array flag. As that was the case, the addition of these other array flags did not sound good to him.</p>

  <p>When Yehudi heard the whooshing sounds, he could not help but frown.</p>

  <p>As Mack laid out six array flags this time around, he formed a hexagon with Yehudi in the center.</p>

  <p>Then Mack took out the magic array controlling plate and offered his life vitality. The six array flags grew bright at the same time, indicating the activation of his magic array.</p>

  <p>With great difficulty, Yehudi escaped the black fog from the first black array flag. Unfortunately, he soon found himself surrounded by Mack's magic array. Standing in the magic array, Yehudi had no choice but to watch out for all possible dangers and stabbed his spear constantly in different directions.</p>

  <p>In fact, Yehudi had trained a wonderful skill in wielding his spear. Every time he waved his spear, it was as quick as a flying dragon, and it even had his life vitality shining at the end of the spear. It must have come from long hours of practice, though no Drizzle Peak disciple knew that Yehudi could wield a spear so deftly. The man must have secretly worked on it.</p>

  <p>Even so, Yehudi was in the magic array at the time, and no matter how hard he tried, it was to no avail as no single one of his attempts touched Mack. Whenever Mack got close to him, it was as though he could not pinpoint the opponent's position!</p>

  <p>On seeing Yehudi's disconcerted look, Mack smiled with great pleasure.</p>

  <p>Then he took out a black-and-red stick from his space ring and calmly moved behind Yehudi.</p>

  <p>'My magic array has trapped you, and you can no longer distinguish truth from falsehood. Therefore, you should know by now that you are at my mercy!' Mack whispered inwardly.</p>

  <p>Although Mack's array was not a killing array, it was a weird one. It could not cause any damage to the people in it. However, it could make many deceptive images of Mack. At the moment, Yehudi was preoccupied with stabbing the replicated images of Mack.</p>

  <p>Even though Yehudi's spear skill was brilliant, he could not know which one was the real Mack while trapped in the magic array. Therefore, in this round, Mack thought he could surely win without difficulty.</p>

  <p>However, when Mack drew closer to Yehudi and tried to hit the man with the black-and-red club, the latter seemed to have sensed something and turned around immediately to face Mack. At the same time, he thrust his spear instinctively.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Thrusting the spear with his hand, the weapon flew towards Mack's chest at the speed of lightning.</p>

  <p>Taken aback, Mack did not expect that Yehudi would recognize him among so many replicated illusions of him. The sudden burst of Yehudi frightened him extremely and for a quick second, he got stunned. Then he realized what was happening, took a deep breath, and quickly drew back with his greatest strength.</p>

  <p>"Zzz!"</p>

  <p>It was a little late for Mack to react; Yehudi's spear lacerated his clothes.</p>

  <p>However, Yehudi did not stab Mack's body successfully and instead held his spear to follow Mack's body closely.</p>

  <p>While deep in thought, Mack twisted to deflect the sharp end of Yehudi's spear, barely managing to do so.</p>

  <p>'It is indeed unexpected, ' Mack thought to himself.</p>

  <p>His heart sank. Mack had thought he was surely going to win the fight after he successfully activated his magic array. On the other hand, he never expected that the man had such a great sensibility and could recognize him even with so many deceptive replicas as a distraction.</p>

  <p>The power of Mack's magic array was outstanding, and Yehudi could not distinguish which image of Mack was true. The secret, though, was that Yehudi himself had an incomparable sensibility and he could notice the killing intent from Mack.</p>

  <p>These images might have been the same as his own true body, including the killing intent of him. However, Mack was not strong enough to make his magic array do that, and hence, Yehudi could find him from so many illusory images instinctually.</p>

  <p>"I never expected you to have such a great sensibility. It is a mistake to look down on you the last time. Now that's it!</p>

  <p>Let's see how you can get out of this!" Mack said, gritting his teeth. He took out a thin and long crystal and pressed it to the magic array controlling plate. Soon after the crystal was embedded in, seething energy emerged from the plate.</p>

  <p>The plate could control the magic array. When Mack had put an extra crystal into it, the magic array's power increased.</p>

  <p>Unlike earlier, Yehudi was not calm anymore. Standing in the magic array, he seemed to have seen something terrifying and continuously struck with his spear while simultaneously feeling perplexed by it.</p>

  <p>Again, Mack held his black and red stick and snuck behind Yehudi with a stiff smile. While the latter pierced his spear in another direction, Mack waved his stick to knock Yehudi on his left shoulder with a strong force.</p>

  <p>"Stick Skill With Heavenly Strength!" he shouted while using his most powerful motion.</p>
