<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1706 A Fierce Battle </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While they had a heated discussion among themselves, they saw a bright silver light being dragged along in Tianming's hand.</p>

  <p>The light was suspended and sometimes it lengthened, sometimes it sharpened, sometimes it was fanning out, and sometimes it was rippling like a wave.</p>

  <p>In fact, not many people could clearly see his sword, but only the light occasionally reflected from its glittering surface.</p>

  <p>There were still many extremely powerful weapons in the universe that had yet to leave their names on the Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>For example, the Heaven and Earth Mirror of the Celestial Position race, and the Evil Door of Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p id="top_14">The light in Tianming's eyes flickered with intensity. His attack had become like a tempest, yet it did not inflict any damage on Kurt despite its high speed.</p>

  <p>Kurt's methods were too strange, filling Tianming with a foreboding of danger.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Kurt was an opponent who could see what would happen in the future.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although Tianming's speed was already unimaginably fast, Kurt was still able to wield his Nine-ring Staff almost leisurely to block Tianming's attack.</p>

  <p>Somehow, he had known when Tianming would seek to deliver the fatal blow.</p>

  <p>Even Kurt's occasional counterattack offered a huge threat to Tianming.</p>

  <p>"If I am not wrong, you can see the future," Tianming observed easily.</p>

  <p>Kurt brought his palms together and slightly shook the Nine-ring Staff.</p>

  <p>"The only one who can see the future is not me, but Maitreya."</p>

  <p>By mentioning Maitreya, he was referring to the Buddha of the Future.</p>

  <p>Tianming wasn't interested in the enlightenment of Buddhist words. He once again placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. "Well then, if I were to cut your staff to pieces, how would you defend against my sword then?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he unsheathed his sword from the scabbard, and he transformed into a ray of light as he rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head from where he was watching on the stone. Tianming's analysis was correct.</p>

  <p>In the first round of this fierce duel, Tianming might not have been able to injure Kurt, but one of the rings on his staff had been broken during combat.</p>

  <p>The nine rings of the staff were deeply connected to each other, signifying the nine worlds of Buddhism.</p>

  <p>Powerhouses like Kurt were able to instantly open the nine overlapping worlds, and they could trap their opponents within them, rendering their opponents lost and unable to escape.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Tianming, having managed to break a ring of the staff, had actually gained the advantage.</p>

  <p>Even when Tianming was walking in the light, Kurt's face remained impassive. He continued using his staff to block Tianming's sword.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Tianming unleashed a flurry of sword strikes. The speed of his blade was so fast that it was suffocating to watch.</p>

  <p>Tinkling...</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Following a series of crisp breaking sounds, another golden ring snapped apart.</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't hesitate for even a moment as he continued to circle around Kurt and unleash many more fearsome sword strikes.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a third golden ring shattered, its broken curves slipping to the board.</p>

  <p>Then a fourth one.</p>

  <p>Then a fifth one.</p>

  <p>When the last golden ring finally shattered, the Nine-ring Staff, which had originally been glowing with a glorious light, suddenly dimmed and went dark.</p>

  <p>For this staff to be hailed as a supreme divine weapon, it had relied on the nine golden rings inlaid upon it. After the rings were all shattered, its power dropped, and its level instantly fell.</p>

  <p>Now, it could be considered as nothing more than a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>In the Hidden Spirit Temple, many monks sat cross-legged on the ground, chanting in low voices.</p>

  <p>A few of the esteemed monks were staring up at the painting.</p>

  <p>"The Nine-ring Staff has shattered."</p>

  <p>"It's normal. The sword attacks were sharp, and they were unleashed at a terrible speed. Kurt simply couldn't block them all."</p>

  <p>"Everyone knows that the staff is famous for its nine rings, but no one knows that the Asura is hidden inside. The nine rings are merely shackles."</p>

  <p>"Kurt has borrowed and studied the power of his opponent."</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Returning his sword back to its scabbard, Tianming stood to the side as he asked in an indifferent tone, "How are you going to block my sword strikes now?"</p>

  <p>Kurt looked at the staff in his hand, but there was no sign of anxiety on his face. "Buddhism advocates great freedom, but the nine worlds were built as shackles. The world we live in is like an illusion, and yet it can hold the Asura."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the top of the staff started to glow with a bloody Mu Ning, and instantly, scarlet blood flowed from the top, trickling down over Kurt's hands that were clasped around the staff.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Kurt's temperament underwent a drastic change. He had originally had an amiable look on his face, but at this moment, his expression had turned ferocious. His calm eyes were consumed by a ruthless Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Asura!</p>

  <p>As a sacred object of the Hidden Spirit Temple, the Nine-ring Staff was rarely seen. Its first form had been more than enough to deal with the enemies of this world.</p>

  <p>However, there was a terrible secret hidden within the sacred staff.</p>

  <p>Inside it an evil spirit was sealed, which was also known as Asura.</p>

  <p>Should the nine rings be destroyed, the staff's body would become possessed by the Asura.</p>

  <p>While Kurt looked at his bloody hands, his ears became extremely sharp and lengthened. He no longer resembled a human, but a monster instead.</p>

  <p>However, his voice had remained calm.</p>

  <p>"Transforming into the Asura is not allowed within Buddhist practice, but the path of Buddhism that I practice strives for the freedom of good and evil. It can be said that it's a free way of Buddhism. Hence, I can transform into the Asura."</p>

  <p>After explaining, he grabbed the staff and thrust downwards.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Many cracks began to spread out along with the staff, as the ring-less staff began to vibrate.</p>

  <p>The one-million-foot long Heaven Earth Board was considered not large by martial artists. With Kurt's light tap, the surging force spread out, turning the entire board into rubble that shot up into the air before instantly collapsing to dust.</p>

  <p>Tianming drew his sword and floated up into the air to confront Kurt.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, you have to be careful!"</p>

  <p>Whir...</p>

  <p>After Kurt transformed into the Asura, his speed had become strange and his movements unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Kurt circled around in the air once before he sent out numerous staff shadows, which covered the sky and the earth in darkness as they headed towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Great Wise Staff Technique!"</p>

  <p>After Kurt drew near, Tianming once again stepped on the light he carried, and in a flash he had traveled a great distance away.</p>

  <p>The Great Wise Staff Technique was extremely fearsome. Combined with the Asura form, the cutting force of the staff was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Tianming had no choice but to retreat in the face of the deadly assault.</p>

  <p>However, Kurt didn't want to leave Tianming even the slightest chance. As he executed the Great Wise Staff Technique, the staff shadows covered the sky and blocked out the sun as they headed towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>The light beneath Tianming's feet flickered as he travelled like a meteor, speeding through the layers of staff shadows. Although the shadows were densely arrayed, they didn't even touch Tianming's sleeves at all.</p>

  <p>Although Kurt brandished tens of thousands of staff shadows, a kind of different foresight appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The scene from the future was extremely hazy, but every single image had crystal clear value to him.</p>

  <p>It was a scene that would happen nine seconds later.</p>

  <p>After nine seconds, Tianming would suddenly circle behind him.</p>

  <p>Three seconds. Six seconds. Nine seconds!</p>

  <p>Nine seconds later, Kurt had already taken a step forward and placed his staff protectively behind his back.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The staff accurately blocked Tianming's anticipated sword attack.</p>

  <p>Tianming's attack failed, and he immediately withdrew with a slight frown wrinkling his brow.</p>

  <p>Kurt could see the future, so he could anticipate every single move in advance. This was indeed troublesome.</p>

  <p>This battle was proving even more difficult than Tianming had imagined.</p>

  <p>None of the warriors who could make it into the top five were weak. Not only were they nearly perfect in every aspect, but they also possessed extraordinary theurgy.</p>

  <p>A cold light flickered in Tianming's eyes as he stared up at the numerous staff shadows descending upon him.</p>

  <p>He needed a different method, now!</p>

  <p>Clearly, he had not expected that before he could change his moves, Kurt had already been one step ahead of him. Kurt intended to suppress Tianming, and gave him no chance to fight back.</p>
