  <p>Later that night, Zheng took out Anthony's Purple Blue Sword and examined it.</p>

  <p>The sword was aesthetic and of good quality.</p>

  <p>Its scabbard was inlaid with colorful gems and gold threads. Since the sword was well preserved, Zheng could see that Anthony had taken great care of it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng pulled the blade out of the scabbard, a whoosh sound filled the silence in the room. When the blade was free of its casing, the sword emanated a purple and blue light.</p>

  <p>"What a good sword!"</p>

  <p>It was a top grade mysterious weapon. The sword looked like it was at the same level as Evil Lan's Hell Fire Sword. But Zheng felt that the sword's quality was much better than that of the Hell Fire Sword.</p>

  <p>He hesitated a little. It was a pity that such a good sword had to be melted.</p>

  <p>Anthony had asked his friends to talk with Zheng. He wanted to recover his sword, but Zheng categorically refused him.</p>

  <p>To improve his strength, Zheng had to offer the sword to the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned thoughtfully as he gazed at the sword. A while later, Zheng had made his decision. Without hesitating further, he began to communicate with the furnace in his mind.</p>

  <p>The black flame shot out of his brow and headed straight for the Purple Blue Sword. The black flame was so quick that a strange arc was drawn in the air.</p>

  <p>The sword was like firewood. It burned from point to pommel in an instant! When the black flame thoroughly devoured the sword, a few drops of molten iron essence were left behind. In the dimly lit room, these drops of molten iron gave off a brilliant light.</p>

  <p>Zheng counted the particles of the molten iron essence. His eyes lit up with the number. He murmured, "The Purple Blue Sword is at the same level as the Hell Fire Sword, but it gave ten drops of hot metal essence! What a surprise!"</p>

  <p>He couldn't explain why this had happened. What was more, Zheng had not yet figured out what the hot metal essence was for!</p>

  <p>Zheng had gone through all the ancient books on weapon refining in Evil Lan's space ring, but he could not find anything about the origin and usage of molten iron essence. Since this was still a mystery to Zheng, he had decided to visit weapon refining masters as they might have some explanations for the essence of the molten metal.</p>

  <p>After the black flame sent the ten drops of iron to the cyan dragon's mouth, bright green light burst out from two gray scales on the dragon.</p>

  <p>After the light dissipated, Zheng found that another two dragon scales had been activated.</p>

  <p>So far, four dragon scales had lit up on the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Zheng clenched his fist and felt the new power surge through him. Earlier, he had reached the marrow refining level. Adding the strength of the four dragon scales, Zheng would now have the power to fight against a cultivator at the nature level.</p>

  <p>Later that night, Zheng completed his preparations. At dawn the next day, he left Drizzle Peak quietly.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't told his friends about his plans. If they knew he had accepted such a dangerous mission, they would feel bound to stop him. Zheng knew what he had to do and he was unwilling to waste any more time discussing the subject with others.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't notice was that a man was watching Zheng as he left his room.</p>

  <p>The tall, dark-skinned man was Liam Cao, with whom Zheng had a dispute several days ago, because Liam supported Thomas of the Zhuge clan.</p>

  <p>After the fight, Liam Cao sent Thomas back. At that time, he was ordered to spy on Zheng. Fren, one of the most gifted children of the Zhuge Clan, had asked him to follow Zheng. Fren had instructed Liam to inform him if Zheng left Drizzle Peak. Liam was thrilled as he would now be able to avenge himself.</p>

  <p>When Liam noticed Zheng leave Drizzle Peak in the morning, he was happy that the opportunity had finally come. He inconspicuously followed Zheng.</p>

  <p>After trailing Zheng for a while, Liam realized that Zheng was headed to the east of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Zheng was leaving Cloud Sect, but there was no exit to the east. He felt confused about Zheng's plans.</p>

  <p>It didn't take Zheng long to walk to the Bluesky Parking Ground. That was when Liam realized that Zheng must have accepted the mission of shielding against insect aggression.</p>

  <p>Several days ago, insects began flooding the Empire. Cloud Sect had tasked many disciples with killing these blade locusts.</p>

  <p>Since the insect infestation was in the southern part of the Empire, it would take the disciples a long time to cross the mountains and rivers by foot. The journey was so long that if disciples traveled by foot, the insect aggression would probably be over by the time the disciples arrived.</p>

  <p>Therefore, most disciples used the Bluesky Parking Ground to reach their destination quicker.</p>

  <p>There were gigantic flying chariots in Cloud Sect and the Bluesky Parking Ground was the place where the gigantic flying chariots parked.</p>

  <p>The chariot was so quick that it would take only a day to reach the southern part of the Empire.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had stopped at the Bluesky Parking Ground, it must mean that he was also going South to kill the blade locusts.</p>

  <p>Liam wondered why Zheng was in a hurry to take a task that seemed beyond his ability.</p>

  <p>"Since you're in such a hurry to die, I'll give you a hand!" With a cold smile on his face, Liam retreated slowly. He would report the matter to Fren first.</p>

  <p>The Bluesky Parking Ground was a man-made square landing pad, about ten feet high.</p>

  <p>When Zheng climbed up the steps, he found that many Cloud Sect disciples were waiting.</p>

  <p>They were at the Bluesky Parking Ground for the same purpose as Zheng.</p>

  <p>They had all accepted the task of destroying the insect aggression as ordered by Cloud Sect.</p>
