  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yao's explanation was not convincing.</p>

  <p>None of the Demon Night people present had a Soul-sealing Needle in their soul, so they had no idea of the origins of their race.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Demon Night race, Yao was the unwavering beacon of faith. It was enough for her to just give an explanation. No one would care if the explanation was truthful or outrageous, because it was unthinkable for them to question the queen's words.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter if you are confused, dubious, or even furious; it won't change the decision made by Ying and me. All world lords, regroup your troops and remain in Punishment World until further instruction. I will herald the golden age of the Demon Night!"</p>

  <p>After issuing the command, Yao turned around and left. The crystal doors were shut behind her. She still needed to convene with the Supreme Lords of Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Those Supreme Lords weren't as easy to convince as the ordinary Demon Night civilians. Yao could let them probe the Soul-sealing Needle, so it wasn't a tough job for her. The next step for the Demon Night army was to wait for the perfect moment to launch a deadly attack on the human beings.</p>

  <p>In such a short span of time, Humanity Alliance had lost two hundred supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race's formidable army didn't encounter any strong resistance. At this pace, the Sacred race could devour the whole Humanity Alliance within two years.</p>

  <p>In core supreme world of Celestial Position, the fight had started.</p>

  <p>A swift and fierce Mu Ning radiated from the expansive hall.</p>

  <p>This Mu Ning swept over everything in the hall like countless thin blades.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Thousands of tiny slashes appeared in the magnificent hall due to the attack of this blade-like Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>A myriad of scratches suddenly appeared on the wall, the floor, the ceiling, and even on the statues that were made from rare materials.</p>

  <p>If someone was in the hall now, one would be badly mutilated just by contacting the Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"We... When will we take action?" a sweet and melodic voice asked.</p>

  <p>It was Supreme Lord of Oracle of the Humanity Alliance. Her eyes glowed like an ignited black gem. The fierce Mu Ning earlier was casually set off by her as she couldn't suppress her anger anymore.</p>

  <p>Aside from Supreme Lord of Oracle, there were more than twenty human Supreme Lords present in the hall. They all kept their silence.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race's first foothold was in Spring race, just beyond the Sighing Wall. At that time, Humanity Alliance already perceived that they would be the first target to be attacked when the Sacred race initiated the war.</p>

  <p>Humanity Alliance wasn't lacking in power. Supreme Lord of Oracle was one of the four great top-rank Supreme Lords in the universe. Besides her, Supreme Lord Illusion, Supreme Lord Healum and the others carried good Heavenly Destiny, too.</p>

  <p>If they fought with full force when they were attacked, two hundred supreme worlds shouldn't have been lost in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Humanity Alliance had a bad reputation now. Sentient creatures in the whole universe were ridiculing their cowardice.</p>

  <p>Some world lords who were attacked by the Sacred race even used Roaring Tokens to harass the Supreme Lord of Oracle. They blamed her for being a coward when the war started. They felt ashamed of her for being the head of Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>Despite being a woman, Supreme Lord of Oracle had a hot temper.</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race declared war, Master Feng told Humanity Alliance not to fight back and continuously withdraw their main troops.</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position owes us an explanation," said Supreme Lord of Oracle, staring at Master Feng.</p>

  <p>Master Feng sighed and said, "We have no choice but to endure now."</p>

  <p>"Is this your explanation?" Supreme Lord of Oracle smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin suddenly blurted out, "All hope is not lost.</p>

  <p>We can buy some time by sacrificing those supreme worlds."</p>

  <p>"Buy time for what? Wait until the ten Godly Geniuses grow up and get us out of this situation?" Supreme Lord of Oracle asked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was speechless.</p>

  <p>To cultivate these ten Godly Geniuses, all resources in the whole universe were used. Each of them had perfect talent in their own field.</p>

  <p>Even the present Supreme Lords couldn't compete with them at their young age.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a Godly Genius was, it still took some time to grow up.</p>

  <p>If these Godly Geniuses had a hundred years to cultivate, the current predicament would be totally different.</p>

  <p>They had just cultivated for more than a year, when the Sacred race started to act.</p>

  <p>Would these Godly Geniuses become True Gods in a few years?</p>

  <p>It seemed like a daydream. No matter how highly the Supreme Lord of Oracle regarded Luo Luo Zheng, almost everyone else thought it was impossible.</p>

  <p>So many of the Supreme Lords had the wishful thinking to buy time by sacrificing some space. As of now, there was nothing they could do except watch as the universe was devoured by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"Our master must have had his own reasons as to why everything ended up like this. As descendants of our master, we need to trust him. If we survive the crisis, we will repay Humanity Alliance with our deeds!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng continued.</p>

  <p>Before Supreme Lord of Oracle was able to speak, a handsome young man sneered beside her and said, "I'm afraid we can't wait until that time.</p>

  <p>Humanity Alliance couldn't sacrifice all of us to buy time for Celestial Position! Excuse me for a while!"</p>

  <p>He transformed into two different illusions, went separate directions, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>He was Supreme Lord Illusion of Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>Celestial Position and Humanity Alliance stood in different positions.</p>

  <p>Celestial Position looked at the crisis from an overall point of view and examined the problem from the global stand.</p>

  <p>Even though the Sacred race was really in hot pursuit, they just acquired two hundred supreme worlds. It would have taken too much of their time to occupy thousands of supreme worlds in Humanity Alliance territory.</p>

  <p>From the Humanity Alliance's perspective, they couldn't stand seeing their worlds being occupied by others while they did nothing.</p>

  <p>Gathered by Celestial Position, all the races joined together to resist against the Sacred race. But Celestial Position didn't fight back and just watched, when the Sacred race attacked them. The Humanity Alliance couldn't accept that the Celestial Position even required them to stop fighting back. This was going too far for Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Humanity Alliance understood that the invasion of the Sacred race stemmed from the conflicts in the divine land. That was the war between higher classes of beings. The Celestial Position represented one of the forces involved in the war. Humanity Alliance couldn't accept the method the Celestial Position adopted.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, I only killed four world lords today, including... Supreme Lord of Oracle, we have already met once. I am impressed by your beauty. If you'd like to have fun with me, I will halt my troops and won't attack you for three months. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Maha's voice was conveyed by a Roaring Token. All of the Supreme Lords heard this. Master Feng frowned and thought, 'Maha's provocation is getting worse.'</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it any more. That's going too far!" Supreme Lord of Oracle had a weird smile on her face, which was obviously out of rage. She gave the present Supreme Lords a stern look and turned around to step into the void.</p>

  <p>Following her, Supreme Lord Healum from Humanity Alliance also left.</p>

  <p>As he saw the three important Supreme Lords from Humanity Alliance who left, Supreme Lord of Original Sin couldn't help but sigh, "Maybe we made a wrong decision."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, who had been silent earlier, shook his head, too. "The time is too short. Maybe we shouldn't have put our all hopes in these young Godly Geniuses."</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position wore a complicated expression, too.</p>

  <p>If no one prevented Supreme Lord of Oracle from leading Humanity Alliance against the Sacred race, the consequences could be easily imagined. If the elites from Humanity Alliance completely fell, it would be a great loss to the human race.</p>

  <p>Master Feng sighed again.</p>

  <p>He hadn't felt this kind of emotion for a long time.</p>

  <p>Everything went smoothly since he became the head of Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position rose sharply. Ten Godly Geniuses had been selected successfully and Luo Luo Zheng grew rapidly. Everything all went according to plan and seemed to be on schedule.</p>

  <p>The head of Celestial Position even took all the successes for granted, because the Celestial Position was created by the disciple of the universe's master. Things shouldn't be going wrong.</p>

  <p>However, a fatal mistake occurred. Sacred race had broken through the Sighing Wall, which was beyond everyone's expectation. Consequently, the selected Godly Geniuses didn't have enough time to cultivate.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's time to counterattack. I will go to visit Wynn," Master Feng said as he then disappeared into the hall.</p>
