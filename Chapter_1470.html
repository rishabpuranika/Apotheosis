<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1470 The Power Of Incense (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Enzo." Yao's voice sounded indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my queen." Enzo, the man in the fine clothes, placed his hand on his chest, waiting for the order from his queen.</p>

  <p>"Seal off Xun's Pool of Faith, and then send out Salvador, Viveca, Aneisha, and Elspeth to head for the Dark World!" Yao ordered.</p>

  <p>Hearing this order, Enzo looked hesitant. "But what about the Board of Elders�"</p>

  <p>"They won't say anything." Yao's face remained expressionless. As the Queen of Punishment, the controller of the court, who would dare to gainsay her now?</p>

  <p>"Those who speak against me will join the dead," Yao added.</p>

  <p>Sealing the Pool of Faith was a massive taboo.</p>

  <p>This was because the three Pools of Faith absorbed the Faith Energy from the trillions of members of the Demon Night, through the three queens' statues every second of every day. This was Xun's source of power.</p>

  <p>Once the Pool of Faith was sealed, it would be impossible for Xun to extract Faith Energy from her Pool of Faith, and the Faith Energy of the trillions of members would also not be able to replenish her Pool of Faith!</p>

  <p>The queens of the Demon Night were not always the same. Xun would die, and so would Yao, eventually. However, the Demon Night would always have three queens. Once the old queens died, they would choose others to become their new queens.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the three Pools of Faith did not belong to any single one of them. They were the most precious and prized possession of the entire Demon Night race�</p>

  <p>Forcefully sealing a Pool of Faith would inevitably result in a backlash from the Board of Elders! This was trouble which Yao would have to account for.</p>

  <p>But that didn't matter. The current Board of Elders was weak and easily manipulated, and didn't have much of a binding force over Yao. The Queen of Life had maintained her silence, and more than ninety percent of Xun's old supporters had been ruthlessly eliminated by Yao.</p>

  <p>Now who could contend against her?</p>

  <p>Previously, Yao hadn't chosen to seal Xun's Pool of Faith because she had hoped that Xun would use the Faith Energy from her Pool of Faith, so that she could trace her and find where she was. The Faith Energy could be used as a method to track Xun and plan an attack against her.</p>

  <p>Of course Xun knew what had been on Yao's mind. So after she had ascended to the Upper World, Xun had never even considered using her Pool of Faith�</p>

  <p>It had been unintentional that the golden-haired girl with the bloodline of the ancient Demon Night race had accidentally unleashed the Power of Three Queens, thus exposing Xun's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Since she had already been exposed, Xun had no scruples any more, and now she did her utmost to help Luo Zheng pass through the rest of the journey in the Endless Abyss as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>However, the problem was that Xun was unable to display the full power of the Faith Energy. Firstly, she was too far away from the Pool of Faith to draw on her full might. Secondly, Xun was not in her complete form, as she was only a soul in her current existence. Without these obstacles, she would have easily assisted Luo Zheng to leave the Endless Abyss, and the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place who waited outside would have no power to stop her.</p>

  <p>Therefore, before her Pool of Faith was sealed, she had to seize the opportunity!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng descended at an extremely fast speed, almost reaching terminal velocity, while Xun followed by his side. She firmly grasped the Cold Plum Blood Spear with one hand. In the face of any potential danger that appeared in the abyss, she would be able to destroy it with one blow�</p>

  <p>Originally, it would have taken at least four hours to finish one lap of the Endless Abyss. However, with Xun at his side to protect him and the meteoric speed at which he fell, Luo Zheng managed to pass through the fourth lap in less than an hour!</p>

  <p>"There is another cave!"</p>

  <p>"We're not going into it."</p>

  <p>Though the treasures in the cave were also important, they now had no time to even think about them. A hundred thousand years ago, Xun had obtained huge benefits in the fourth cave. Moreover, she had also planted a now-extinct Sacred Thunder Bamboo in the fourth cave. The environment in that cave was very suitable for this Sacred Thunder Bamboo's growth. It would be a priceless find to reclaim the Sacred Thunder Bamboo.</p>

  <p>Now that one hundred thousand years had passed, how many inches had the Sacred Thunder Bamboo grown? Had it thrived and become a fantastic and magical forest of bamboo? If Luo Zheng could harvest some of the sacred shoots from the Sacred Thunder Bamboo, he could then comprehend even the most powerful and profound mysteries of the sixth layer of the Thunder Law! How incredibly powerful Luo Zheng would then become!</p>

  <p>But now, Xun wanted to help Luo Zheng quickly pass through the fifth lap since time was now against her!</p>

  <p>Perhaps with Zheng's own strength, he would also have been able to pass through the fifth lap by himself. However, there was not much time left, and right now, they had to progress as fast as they could. As for the Sacred Thunder Bamboo, they would still have a chance to obtain it after they passed the fifth lap!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh�"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swept past the fourth cave at lightning speed, like what he had done with the third one, and then he entered the fifth lap, which was the final circle of the Endless Abyss!</p>
