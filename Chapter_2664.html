  <p>A look of puzzlement appeared on Luo Zheng's face. "Do you also have 3, 000 Divine Dao?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had laughed at Luo Zheng for his stupid behavior of integrating the Divine Dao just now.</p>

  <p>And then, he told Luo Zheng that he could choose any Divine Dao as he liked.</p>

  <p>Did that mean that Fuxi also cultivated the 3, 000 Divine Dao?</p>

  <p>Chiyou was supposedly the creator of the 3, 000 Divine Dao so how could he know them?</p>

  <p>There was a touch of embarrassment on Fuxi's face. "I don't know all the 3, 000 Divine Dao but I've mastered seventy to eighty percent. After Chiyou created them, I also tried to integrate them."</p>

  <p>The Grand World Cultivation Method was created by the Snake Goddess, which attributed the creation of life and people to her.</p>

  <p>Before Chiyou's creation of the 3, 000 Divine Dao, people generally practiced some kind of energy to the extreme and used it to create their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>At that time, Chiyou strove to merge all the energy in the Source World in order to pursue the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>

  <p>However, the different types of energy weren't arranged under categories. With his wit and remarkable talent, Chiyou managed to gather all of them and listed 3, 000 Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>These Divine Dao were classified according to subject, which enthused people everywhere to integrate them.</p>

  <p>Those born in ancient times sought the truth theurgies and tried to integrate the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, they found out that this did not work.</p>

  <p>Fuxi laughed now but he was most probably crazy for it back then, judging from his strong thirst for the truth token.</p>

  <p>Among the 3, 000 Divine Dao Chiyou created, Fuxi was able to master 2, 630. Moreover, according to what he said, about 300 Divine Dao were essentially same as others. The Parting Water Divine Dao and the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao, for example, were different in energy performance but derived from the same energy.</p>

  <p>Fuxi worked really hard but got nothing in the end when he failed to gather all the energy. To say he was disappointed was an understatement.</p>

  <p>Thus, he began to laugh at those who tried to do the same thing. It was impossible to combine the 3, 000 Divine Dao and transform them into the energy of the Divine Dao Great Unity as far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng having absorbed several hundred Divine Dao, Fuxi couldn't help himself and teased the young man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, of course, had no idea of all this or what was going through Fuxi's mind. "I choose the Emotion Closing Divine Dao," he told him.</p>

  <p>He had previously used the Spiritual Darkness to refine his Godly Tile but he hadn't really made any progress in exploring the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Now that he was slated to return to the divine land, he was eager to improve his cultivation by breaking through a Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Fuxi nodded at his answer. "Okay."</p>

  <p>He had explored Luo Zheng's inner world just now and found the young man's main part of the Godly Tile to be the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. Luo Zheng's choice didn't really come as a surprise for him.</p>

  <p>With a gentle pat, a grayish-white sheet appeared over their heads.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up and saw huge Eight Diagrams on the sheet along with countless grey and white lights. There was a mysterious aura that emanated from it as it spun.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"This is the Eight Diagrams Chart," Fuxi answered smugly.</p>

  <p>The fact that Fuxi possessed eight ancient treasures was already well-known: the Dragon River Painting, the Nine Halls Diagram, the Cyan Divination Herb, the Phoenix Zither, the Demons Refining Calabash, the Eight Diagrams Chart, the Heaven and Earth Dagger, and the Book of Longevity. Each treasure was enough to attract the attention and interest of countless masters on its own.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in a minute," Fuxi answered before pointing his finger upwards. The Eight Diagrams Chart suddenly moved and enveloped Luo Zheng entirely.</p>

  <p>As the sheet covered him, Luo Zheng felt his entire body tremble. His soul had been cut off from all perception and he found himself falling into a monochrome world.</p>

  <p>The sight of a dumbstruck Luo Zheng made Fuxi smile. "You are lucky to have me use the Eight Diagrams Chart to help you break through."</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, Fuxi immediately fell into a trance and closed his emotions. He pressed his index and middle fingers together before lightly snapping towards the Eight Diagrams Chart.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A burst of sword energy immediately flew towards it!</p>

  <p>After that, Fuxi took a few steps back and leaned onto the tombstone.</p>

  <p>There was a reason why he willingly helped this young man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been chosen by Othniel as an agent and would no doubt make a difference in the future.</p>

  <p>Although Fuxi did not have the ability to see the future, he could make a few assumptions.</p>

  <p>He had sworn himself to be the Finale Hero, and for that, he paid a huge price. Luo Zheng might very well prove to be an asset and help him in the future.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was floating in that grey and white world.</p>

  <p>Inside this strange place, Luo Zheng realized that all his thoughts had slowed down.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams Chart continued to lazily rotate above him, making him feel sleepy.</p>

  <p>This environment felt very calming and he felt as if he could think more clearly here.</p>

  <p>"What a strange feeling.</p>

  <p>If I cultivate under such a state, I will most probably make rapid progress.</p>

  <p>This magic weapon of Fuxi is pretty good."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not really know the origins of this Eight Diagrams Chart but it must be of great value.</p>

  <p>The serene, peaceful state was broken, however, upon the arrival of a disturbance above him.</p>

  <p>This disturbance came in the form of sword energy and Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he caught sight of it.</p>

  <p>"The sword energy is amazing! The Emotion Closing Divine Dao contained in it is so pure. I can't see through it."</p>

  <p>Although he had made great attainments in the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, he still hadn't reached the level of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Divine Dao within the sword energy in front of him was extremely mysterious. There was no way Luo Zheng could see through it!</p>

  <p>It also moved very slowly.</p>

  <p>The moment the sword energy burst through the Eight Diagrams Chart, it split into two rays. Upon a second collision, it further split into four and continued on and on.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Divine Dao gets weaker with each collision." A glint flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Four rays.</p>

  <p>Eight rays.</p>

  <p>Sixteen rays.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows when the sword energy reached 128 rays.</p>

  <p>"The Ripping Consciousness?"</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng could finally see the Emotion Closing Divine Dao within the sword energy.</p>

  <p>Just as he figured it out, the 128 rays began to merge once again.</p>
