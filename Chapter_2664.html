<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2664 The Eight Diagrams Chart </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>A look of puzzlement appeared on Zheng's face. "Do you also have 3, 000 Godly Ways?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had laughed at Zheng for his stupid behavior of integrating the Godly Ways just now.</p>

  <p>And then, he told Zheng that he could choose any Godly Way as he liked.</p>

  <p>Did that mean that Fuxi also cultivated the 3, 000 Godly Ways?</p>

  <p>Chiyou was supposedly the creator of the 3, 000 Godly Ways so how could he know them?</p>

  <p>There was a touch of embarrassment on Fuxi's face. "I don't know all the 3, 000 Godly Ways but I've mastered seventy to eighty percent. After Chiyou created them, I also tried to integrate them."</p>

  <p>The Grand World Cultivation Method was created by the Snake Goddess, which attributed the creation of life and people to her.</p>

  <p>Before Chiyou's creation of the 3, 000 Godly Ways, people generally practiced some kind of energy to the extreme and used it to create their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>At that time, Chiyou strove to merge all the energy in the Source World in order to pursue the Godly Ways Great Unity.</p>

  <p>However, the different types of energy weren't arranged under categories. With his wit and remarkable talent, Chiyou managed to gather all of them and listed 3, 000 Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>These Godly Ways were classified according to subject, which enthused people everywhere to integrate them.</p>

  <p>Those born in ancient times sought the truth theurgies and tried to integrate the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>However, they found out that this did not work.</p>

  <p>Fuxi laughed now but he was most probably crazy for it back then, judging from his strong thirst for the truth theurgy.</p>

  <p>Among the 3, 000 Godly Ways Chiyou created, Fuxi was able to master 2, 630. Moreover, according to what he said, about 300 Godly Ways were essentially same as others. The Parting Water Godly Way and the Mysterious Ice Godly Way, for example, were different in energy performance but derived from the same energy.</p>

  <p>Fuxi worked really hard but got nothing in the end when he failed to gather all the energy. To say he was disappointed was an understatement.</p>

  <p>Thus, he began to laugh at those who tried to do the same thing. It was impossible to combine the 3, 000 Godly Ways and transform them into the energy of the Godly Ways Great Unity as far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>When he saw Zheng having absorbed several hundred Godly Ways, Fuxi couldn't help himself and teased the young man.</p>

  <p>Zheng, of course, had no idea of all this or what was going through Fuxi's mind. "I choose the Emotion Closing Godly Way," he told him.</p>

  <p>He had previously used the Spiritual Darkness to refine his Godly Tile but he hadn't really made any progress in exploring the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Now that he was slated to return to the divine land, he was eager to improve his cultivation by breaking through a Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Fuxi nodded at his answer. "Okay."</p>

  <p>He had explored Zheng's inner world just now and found the young man's main part of the Godly Tile to be the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Zheng's choice didn't really come as a surprise for him.</p>

  <p>With a gentle pat, a grayish-white sheet appeared over their heads.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up and saw huge Eight Diagrams on the sheet along with countless grey and white lights. There was a mysterious aura that emanated from it as it spun.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"This is the Eight Diagrams Chart," Fuxi answered smugly.</p>

  <p>The fact that Fuxi possessed eight ancient treasures was already well-known: the Dragon River Painting, the Nine Halls Diagram, the Cyan Divination Herb, the Phoenix Zither, the Demons Refining Calabash, the Eight Diagrams Chart, the Heaven and Earth Dagger, and the Book of Longevity. Each treasure was enough to attract the attention and interest of countless masters on its own.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in a minute," Fuxi answered before pointing his finger upwards. The Eight Diagrams Chart suddenly moved and enveloped Zheng entirely.</p>

  <p>As the sheet covered him, Zheng felt his entire body tremble. His soul had been cut off from all perception and he found himself falling into a monochrome world.</p>

  <p>The sight of a dumbstruck Zheng made Fuxi smile. "You are lucky to have me use the Eight Diagrams Chart to help you break through."</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, Fuxi immediately fell into a trance and closed his emotions. He pressed his index and middle fingers together before lightly snapping towards the Eight Diagrams Chart.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A burst of sword energy immediately flew towards it!</p>

  <p>After that, Fuxi took a few steps back and leaned onto the tombstone.</p>

  <p>There was a reason why he willingly helped this young man.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been chosen by Othniel as an agent and would no doubt make a difference in the future.</p>

  <p>Although Fuxi did not have the ability to see the future, he could make a few assumptions.</p>

  <p>He had sworn himself to be the Finale Hero, and for that, he paid a huge price. Zheng might very well prove to be an asset and help him in the future.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was floating in that grey and white world.</p>

  <p>Inside this strange place, Zheng realized that all his thoughts had slowed down.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams Chart continued to lazily rotate above him, making him feel sleepy.</p>

  <p>This environment felt very calming and he felt as if he could think more clearly here.</p>

  <p>"What a strange feeling.</p>

  <p>If I cultivate under such a state, I will most probably make rapid progress.</p>

  <p>This magic weapon of Fuxi is pretty good."</p>

  <p>Zheng did not really know the origins of this Eight Diagrams Chart but it must be of great value.</p>

  <p>The serene, peaceful state was broken, however, upon the arrival of a disturbance above him.</p>

  <p>This disturbance came in the form of sword energy and Zheng's eyes flashed as he caught sight of it.</p>

  <p>"The sword energy is amazing! The Emotion Closing Godly Way contained in it is so pure. I can't see through it."</p>

  <p>Although he had made great attainments in the Emotion Closing Godly Way, he still hadn't reached the level of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way within the sword energy in front of him was extremely mysterious. There was no way Zheng could see through it!</p>

  <p>It also moved very slowly.</p>

  <p>The moment the sword energy burst through the Eight Diagrams Chart, it split into two rays. Upon a second collision, it further split into four and continued on and on.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way gets weaker with each collision." A glint flashed in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Four rays.</p>

  <p>Eight rays.</p>

  <p>Sixteen rays.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows when the sword energy reached 128 rays.</p>

  <p>"The Ripping Consciousness?"</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng could finally see the Emotion Closing Godly Way within the sword energy.</p>

  <p>Just as he figured it out, the 128 rays began to merge once again.</p>
