  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race seemed to be very primitive. Their social structure was still dependent on the authority of ancient clans.</p>

  <p>However, there were still many mysteries hidden within just awaiting discovery!</p>

  <p>It could even be said that they were cultivating with every move!</p>

  <p>For instance, the women of the Collapsing Mountain race would be pregnant for 30 years. During these 30 years, their babies would be baptized by the tribe's singing every day. They would passively undergo body refining before they were born!</p>

  <p>During the process of body tempering, the fetus would gradually adapt to the gravitational force, and after it was born, it would have immense strength.</p>

  <p>Thus, when a baby from the Collapsing Mountain race was born, it would already be able to crawl across the ground ?</p>

  <p>As for the Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists present, they couldn't lift a finger. They weren't even comparable to an infant from the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>This was why the Collapsing Mountain race took the trial tallies and dumped these martial artists here like trash. The Collapsing Mountain race worshiped powerhouses, but these fellows couldn't even compare to the little babies of their race, so they didn't give a damn about them.</p>

  <p>They deserved to take the Collapsing Mountain race's trials, but only if they were able to stand up one day.</p>

  <p>The song of the Collapsing Mountain race lasted for a full two hours!</p>

  <p>Every day after dawn, they would howl like this for two hours. The Collapsing Mountain members actually had the strength to do so.</p>

  <p>This Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was filled with all sorts of strange things. Singing was originally a method of body tempering for this race, so it was considered normal.</p>

  <p>This strange ballad gave rise to a subtle vibration. It felt like countless small hammers, constantly hammering around Luo Zheng's body. He could feel the omnidirectional hammering beginning on the outside and working its way to the inside, slowly immersing itself in his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng finally understood that this flesh refining method was similar to the principle of the Grand Weapon Refining Method that he practiced himself!</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Weapon Refining Method was intended to transform a person into a weapon and then make them undergo training. The purpose of the Collapsing Mountain race's method was to directly beat up their body ?</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng hadn't undergone the training to turn his body into a weapon, he definitely wouldn't have been able to withstand that kind of beating. His injuries would have become increasingly severe, and ordinary people naturally would not have access to his training.</p>

  <p>However, the power of vibration within this song was relatively mild.</p>

  <p>Under the resonance of this song and the powerful gravitational force here, the benefits for a body refiner were obvious.</p>

  <p>Listening to the song for a single day would cause the listeners' vital energy and blood to flow more rapidly and their flesh to tighten. If they continued to listen to it for a year, five years, or ten years, the effects would be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>After ten years, if a warrior still wasn't qualified to climb up and join the Collapsing Mountain race, after leaving this place, their physical body and strength would greatly increase. That was why the Collapsing Mountain race was considered to be a sacred place for cultivation!</p>

  <p>Once the song had finished, all of the Collapsing Mountain members started their daily hunting activities in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>The strength of the clansmen of Collapsing Mountain race was comparable to a world lord or a Supreme Lord. However, there was a sharp distinction between the ways they replenished their bodies. When they reached a certain level of training, world lords and Supreme Lords could feed on the vitality between heaven and earth, while the Collapsing Mountain warriors still had to rely on natural food and had to eat lots of food to replenish their strong bodies.</p>

  <p>If the martial artists that had entered the Collapsing Mountain race could one day stand up and gradually adapt to the gravity, they would also need to go hunting with them.</p>

  <p>However, currently, Luo Luo Zheng and the other martial artists could only watch ?</p>

  <p>When the people from Collapsing Mountain race left, the entire tribe immediately became quiet. Soon, however, many children appeared within the tribe!</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain members were tall and sturdy, and while their children were still child-like in appearance, they were as well-built as their parents. Some of the children were seven or eight feet tall, and would be considered large among the human race.</p>

  <p>After these children appeared, they began to play around in the tribe.</p>

  <p>Some of their pranks caused the tribe's women to shout at them. This was a normal day for the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>After a while, a few children came rushing over.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Toad!</p>

  <p>Uncle Toad! My wooden ox is broken!</p>

  <p>How can I fix it?"</p>

  <p>This "Uncle Toad" who was the subject of the children's attention was a martial artist who had come to take the trial.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Luo Zheng, he had managed to adapt to the gravitational force.</p>

  <p>However, he was still unable to completely stand up, and could only lie on the ground on all fours, motionless like a toad, which was where the children got the idea for his nickname ?</p>

  <p>Seeing those children dashing around so effortlessly in the tribe, Luo Luo Zheng sighed deeply in his spirit. They were truly inferior to even the children of the Collapsing Mountain race. No wonder those three clansmen were able to beat up the Formless Sky Python. It was their strength that made this race so unique.</p>

  <p>While the children gathered around "Uncle Toad," the other martial artists could only look on with envy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused at first, but then he realized that this "Uncle Toad" had used one of his skills to create an opportunity for himself!</p>

  <p>Behind each of these children was a small wooden ox. This wooden ox was exquisitely crafted, lifelike and ingenious. It had obviously been created with a unique puppet technique.</p>

  <p>This puppet technique was not indigenous to the Collapsing Mountain race. It was something that Uncle Toad had taught these children when he told them how to create their own puppets. The only thing that Luo Luo Zheng could not understand was that the wooden ox was a puppet and could actually escape from the powerful gravitational force of the Collapsing Mountain race. Perhaps it was because of the materials from which it was made.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Toad, my wooden ox's foot is broken. It looks like a cripple when it's walking. It is extremely ugly!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, who told you to start ox-fighting. If it's broken, it's your own fault."</p>

  <p>"You joined in the ox-fighting too."</p>

  <p>Just as the kids were arguing, Uncle Toad chuckled and said, "I can teach you how to repair the wooden ox' leg, but you know what the rules are?"</p>

  <p>Before Uncle Toad could finish speaking, one of the children took out a large black object and placed it in front of Uncle Toad. "Uncle Toad, I've prepared a piece of meat! I saved it yesterday!"</p>

  <p>That piece of black meat looked ordinary, but under the illumination of the light, it emitted a unique phosphorescent light. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what creature it was cut from, but from his point of view, it was absolutely extraordinary!</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, then I will gladly accept it. Please help to tuck the meat in ?"</p>

  <p>Before Uncle Toad could finish his words, the child had already cut open the piece of meat with a knife and personally fed it to him!</p>

  <p>Not only did this martial artist teach them puppet techniques, but he also taught them how to use puppets to fight, which the children referred to as ox-fighting.</p>

  <p>The materials used to make the wooden ox were not ordinary, but in a fight, the wooden ox would eventually break. Although Uncle Toad taught them how to make the wooden ox, he didn't tell them how to fix it. When it was broken, they must go to him to have it repaired.</p>

  <p>Uncle Toad would only fix the broken ox when they brought him pieces of meat in exchange!</p>

  <p>Only the warriors who participated in the hunting alongside the Collapsing Mountain race were allowed to eat meat. The warriors lying here weren't qualified. The benefits of the meat pieces were obvious; naturally, some people would try to use their brains to get them.</p>

  <p>In truth, this Uncle Toad had only been with the tribe for a short period of time. It was only because he had eaten these pieces of meat that he was able to get up. So, clearly, this meat possessed a magical power.</p>

  <p>Maybe this scheme had been in his mind even before he had entered the Collapsing Mountain race!</p>

  <p>'He is clever, ' Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>The children took out pieces of their own meat and fed them to Uncle Toad. After that, they left satisfied after Uncle Toad told them how to repair the wooden oxen.</p>

  <p>Before the children left, there were also other practitioners lying on the ground trying to "steal business for themselves."</p>

  <p>"I know how to fix that wooden ox too ?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you a story. Do you want to hear it?"</p>

  <p>"I can teach you guys how to make wooden birds. It's fun."</p>

  <p>However, almost all of the children's interest was focused on the wooden ox. The other martial artists' attempted 'seduction' rarely proved effective, and the children soon disappeared without a trace. The group of warriors could not get up, and could only look helplessly at the backs of the group of swiftly vanishing children.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't one of them.</p>

  <p>Since he had unintentionally entered the Collapsing Mountain race, it could be said that it was fate. According to what he had heard, this trial tally was extremely rare. Since he had come in here with her for free, naturally, he would seize this opportunity to fully refine his body!</p>

  <p>The day passed quickly, and by nightfall, the Collapsing Mountain race members had all returned to their tribe.</p>

  <p>Each of them was carrying a colossus on their shoulders. That was their reward for a day of hard work.</p>

  <p>There were single-horned bulls the size of a small mountain, red blood eagles with a wingspan of over a thousand feet, and heterogenetic porcupines covered with golden spikes.</p>

  <p>The abundance of prey left Luo Luo Zheng dumbstruck.</p>
