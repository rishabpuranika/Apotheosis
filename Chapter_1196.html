<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1196 A Strange Feeling </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many heads swiveled around at the same time. Their shock was palpable at the sight of the woman at the Spirit Supreme Realm swooping down at such an unbelievable speed.</p>

  <p>They came forward in a mad rush.</p>

  <p>War King Wind grabbed Fiona and Callan and rushed to the front.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that if they could run in the front, they would survive, and those who lagged behind would definitely die.</p>

  <p>"Holy shit! They are running so fast!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed. He looked at the Soul Sea Realm masters in front of him, and saw that they were trying to dodge him at a speed that was mind-boggling. He was helpless, but he felt a slight heat blossoming in his lower abdomen that indicated waves of life vitality.</p>

  <p>This life vitality was drawn from Brianna's inner world and was in continuous supply. Zheng flew up into the sky by using the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the Divine Emperor Island, they couldn't fly because of the blood sacrifice. The corpses they occupied didn't have any life vitality, so they could only rely on the power of their own physical bodies. The group of Soul Sea Realm masters in front of Zheng could normally fly freely in the sky, but now, they could only run around on the ground with their legs.</p>

  <p>However, their speed was still no match for the flying Zheng, despite the mad dash.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>'Wow! This speed is really amazing!'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought in wonder. He himself was a little stunned. 'Is this the power of a Spirit Supreme Realm master?'</p>

  <p>He utilized the life vitality and shot out at a speed that he would never even have imagined. Even if he brought out his forceful energy and life vitality at the same time, his speed would not be able to hold a candle to his current speed.</p>

  <p>This speed meant that Zheng had caught up to them in no time.</p>

  <p>But he was not familiar with this body and couldn't properly control his speed. He had flown past them and landed in front of these Soul Sea Realm masters. After all, this body was not his own. Because he wasn't able to coordinate properly, he smashed onto the ground when he landed, creating a large crater at the point of contact.</p>

  <p>"Hey, this is my body. Don't do anything reckless!" Because of the Soul Sealing Spell, Brianna was no longer able to control her own body. But this was still her body. This kind of a random collision wouldn't injure her body, but that didn't mean that it was okay to treat it like that.</p>

  <p>Zheng flashed an embarrassed smile and got to his feet.</p>

  <p>He walked over to the group of Soul Sea Realm masters with a smile on his face, but was only greeted with a strange chilliness.</p>

  <p>Most powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm looked nervously at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Turner, War King Wind, and War Emperor York were stronger and calmer than them, but right now, they had already decided to risk their lives in resistance.</p>

  <p>The problem was that even if they fought to death, they were simply no match for a Spirit Supreme Realm master.</p>

  <p>Moreover, since they had already occupied the corpses of others, they were unable to display their full strength.</p>

  <p>Going by this, the top masters of the four divine kingdoms would be in big trouble this time.</p>

  <p>Turner looked calmly at the smiling woman and then said, "Master, we have accidentally landed in the cemetery. Please forgive us if we disturbed you."</p>

  <p>As he watched their expressions, Zheng suddenly had the urge to play a prank. Wiping the smile off his face, he said coldly, "Forgive you? You accidentally landed in the cemetery? Humph! That's nice to hear!"</p>

  <p>The group's hearts sank at Zheng's words. It looked like the woman hadn't come with good intentions.</p>

  <p>All the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were struggling to maintain calm, and this was evident on their faces. If they were to fight against this woman at the Spirit Supreme Realm, all of them would probably die here.</p>

  <p>But Fiona rushed out of the crowd and asked, "Master, what did you do to Tianxing? Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was touched at Fiona's concern for him. He suddenly smiled and said, "Of course I'm fine!"</p>

  <p>The group's confusion grew at this ridiculous reply.</p>

  <p>Fiona was confused as she stared searchingly at the woman in front of her. But she knew that the woman's smile was somewhat familiar.</p>

  <p>Even if people changed their appearances or even their bodies, their previous habits, movements, and features were bound to remain. A thought occurred to Fiona. A possibility.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing! You're Tianxing. You've succeeded!" she said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, smiling.</p>

  <p>Fiona's exclamation brought the realization that this was Zheng himself to the people at the Soul Sea Realm. He had actually succeeded in occupying the body of the woman in the crystal coffin.</p>

  <p>They were greatly relieved. They hadn't expected Zheng to succeed.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, since you've succeeded, can we take over the corpses on the 13th floor?" War King Wind asked.</p>

  <p>Just moments earlier, they had been unable to take over the corpses of the super powerful masters on the 13th floor because of this woman. But now that Zheng had taken away the body of the woman, they could simply turn around and take over the corpses on the 13th floor.</p>

  <p>Taking away the woman's body was tantamount to removing a crucial obstacle.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded at them and said, "Sure, you can take over the other corpses."</p>

  <p>War King Wind, Scott, War Emperor York, and Turner were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The four of them chose to turn around immediately. The Soul Sea Realm masters who believed that their strength was of the same level as the four emperors also wanted to join them. After all, anyone would be willing to occupy a powerful corpse.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the rest stood where they were, waiting for them to change their corpses.</p>

  <p>Fiona, Callan, Randy, and the rest of the young warriors looked strangely at Zheng. Fiona walked over to Zheng, smiling slowly as she did.</p>

  <p>One usually chose a corpse of the same sex. But Zheng's soul was now in a woman's body, making it an extremely strange experience.</p>

  <p>At first, they hadn't known that the woman was Zheng and had been naturally fearful of her cultivation that was at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>But now that they had discovered that it was actually Zheng, they surrounded him and began to size the body up.</p>

  <p>Randy chuckled and asked, "Tianxing, how do you feel?"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how to respond. As a man, he didn't like the feeling this body brought him, but on the other hand, it was still the body of a Spirit Supreme Realm master. With the help of Brianna's body, the chances of him entering the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land to obtain the Ancestral Dragon's egg would increase by many times.</p>

  <p>"Not good," Fiona said, shaking her head as she sized Zheng up.</p>

  <p>Bewildered, Zheng looked at Fiona before asking, "What's not good?"</p>

  <p>"You're wearing too little!" As Fiona spoke, she took out a set of clothes from her space ring and tossed them to Zheng. Although a majority of the warriors had entered the cemetery in their soul forms, they still carried their space rings with them. After all, their space rings could come in handy if they ever needed anything important that the rings contained.</p>

  <p>The clothes on Brianna's body were flimsy, and her slender legs were exposed. Fiona clucked her tongue as she paid attention to these details.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng picked up the clothes that Fiona had thrown over to him, he was rendered speechless. It was a set of emerald green dresses.</p>

  <p>Zheng refused to wear them, even though he knew that Fiona only had good intentions. He took out a man's outfit from his space ring and casually wrapped it around Brianna's body.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had taken over her body, it was easy for the four emperors to seize the bodies on the thirteenth floor. They returned quickly, once they had taken over the corpses.</p>

  <p>None of the emperors could contain the excitement on their faces, even though they were in someone else's corpses.</p>

  <p>Only one of them had ever gotten a corpse on the thirteenth floor once.</p>

  <p>But this time, all of them had managed to get corpses. It was very likely that this time, they would be able to explore the entire Heavenly Stellar Secret Land in one go, and even obtain the Ancestral Dragon's egg.</p>

  <p>"We still have to thank you this time," Turner said to Zheng.</p>

  <p>War King Wind agreed and said, "That's right. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to obtain so many Soul Cores, and we wouldn't have been able to take over these corpses." War King Wind occupied Federico's corpse, standing in the middle of the crowd like an iron tower, emitting a powerful, domineering aura.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and said, "I'll need all of your help in this secret land."</p>

  <p>He looked towards the end of the cemetery. The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was above these other three secret lands. It was the core of the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>
