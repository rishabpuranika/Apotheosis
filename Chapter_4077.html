<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization's sudden arrival only served to increase the tension on the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Tate simply shot Bacchus a smug look.</p>

  <p>There was no need for word. A single look was all it took for him to say all that he needed to say.</p>

  <p>'Since you chose the wrong side then this shall be your end...'</p>

  <p>Bacchus knew the possible consequences of his actions but that did not mean that he regretted it. He continued to look at Tate straight in the eye. If this was the end, then he would go down fighting.</p>

  <p>For him, he never chose the wrong side but just ran out of choices.</p>

  <p>Back when Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey came to the Night View Island, they immediately chose the Red Demon race as allies and instigated them to kill off the Glede Demon race.</p>

  <p>If it were not for Zheng and his group, then the entire Glede Demon race would've been exterminated by now.</p>

  <p>Since their accidental saviours were forced into a dead end, the best way that the Glede Demon race could repay them was to stay and fight until the end.</p>

  <p>Claire's eyes sparkled with excitement as she looked at the scene in front of her.</p>

  <p>"We chased all the way from the Grand Pure Realm and finally it came to an end..."</p>

  <p>She had no animosity with Zheng and his group even if she suffered defeat by their hands.</p>

  <p>The reason why she was so excited was because she had failed so many times before yet now, victory was so close that she could almost taste it.</p>

  <p>Claire felt like a fisherman stuck out at sea but unable to catch the elusive fishes needed to come back to shore.</p>

  <p>But now, the fishes she so desperately sought for finally got tangled in her net. It was now time to haul them all in.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a crack suddenly appeared on her right shoulder.</p>

  <p>In the crack where her flesh should've been, there was only flames. It was like the cracked surface of a volcano where molten magma raged on.</p>

  <p>From within this fiery crack rose a small, white dragon.</p>

  <p>Despite looking so small and ordinary, this dragon actually contained a strange and powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"Grrr..."</p>

  <p>It circled Claire once before facing off against Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>Claire reached out to touch her dragon's body and the formerly white scales promptly turned into red, set ablaze by her aura!</p>

  <p>She knew of the fact that Zheng had Holy Stones and could use the Light of Annihilation so she quickly took the necessary measures. This little dragon with its red, scaled armor would now be able to face-off against these humans with no problems.</p>

  <p>"Kill them all," she ordered in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Yes, she harbored them no hatred but she did remember how Zheng refused her kind offer several times before. Perhaps there was a part within her that felt just a bit bitter about that.</p>

  <p>Since he was so ungrateful, then he could only meet his end this way.</p>

  <p>"Grrr!"</p>

  <p>The dragon roared and headed straight towards the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Of course, even if things did not seem to go their way, Zheng and his companions weren't going to sit still and wait for death!</p>

  <p>They immediately mobilized as their opponent came rushing at them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, who held a Holy Stone, raised his hand and cast a mark of Eight Diagrams to appear on the surface of the little dragon.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, meanwhile, condensed her crimson shadows into one, long spear that spiraled at high speed and headed straight towards their oncoming opponent.</p>

  <p>So long as they broke through those red, dragon scales and then used the Light of Annihilation, then they would have a chance of winning. At least, that was what they thought.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>However, what happened was the opposite of their expectations.</p>

  <p>Even with the combined force of Fuxi's Eight Diagrams and the Snake Goddess's spear, the dragon's red scales remained unyielding and could not be penetrated at all.</p>

  <p>There was no way the Light of Annihilation could do its job of annihilating their opponent if this little dragon's armor was too tough to break.</p>

  <p>Despite this hurdle, the two of them reacted immediately.</p>

  <p>Since their first attack failed, they retreated right away.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin rushed over to fight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With their combined efforts, the group was able to rain down a series of attacks and sword radiance upon this troublesome little dragon.</p>

  <p>Yasamin's Origin Swordsmanship shone the most since it was almost incomparable in terms of power and speed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, despite their efforts, the little dragon's defensive armor remained intact.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan both used their bloodline theurgies and Other Shore Tokens yet were still unable to make a dent on the little dragon's flame scales.</p>

  <p>It seemed that this time, the gap in strength was just a bit too great.</p>

  <p>Claire suddenly remembered their battle back in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>She had relied on her own strength and struggled so hard against the siege of the Chaos Ancient Gods and several Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Now though, it seemed that the tables had turned. This little white dragon she controlled was infinitely stronger than all these Eternal Realm warriors and she was confident they would never be able to win against it.</p>

  <p>It was a constant push and pull between them. As the group's attacks failed, they would retreat one step back.</p>

  <p>Soon, they were forced into a dead end.</p>

  <p>"Grrr!"</p>

  <p>With its enemies cornered, the little dragon began to transform. Its body began to swell and its head rose to the sky.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight together!"</p>

  <p>Bacchus shouted.</p>

  <p>Ready to give it his all, he released the resentment-level Treacherous Being, the Wolf Owl King from his body and let it wrap around him.</p>

  <p>The other three Glede Demons followed suit and summoned their own Treacherous Beings. There was no other way but to go all out in this fight.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was standing behind them, stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with this," he said, pouncing on the dragon.</p>

  <p>These Eternal Realm warriors were not a match for this little dragon.</p>

  <p>Even if they managed to resist the dragon, there was still the Eye Spirit that continued to watch them covetously.</p>

  <p>The human race in the Ghost Mountain was the only one Zheng felt he could truly rely on.</p>

  <p>However, they still remained a no-show.</p>

  <p>Since that was the case, he could now only rely on the bloodline within his body.</p>

  <p>It was time to use the ancestry-level bloodline!</p>

  <p>Claire's eyes curved in mirth when she saw Zheng pounce onto her dragon.</p>

  <p>This could all have been avoided if he had agreed with her back then, but since he refused then he was doomed to suffer death.</p>

  <p>The little dragon was undeterred and patiently opened its jaw with the full intent of swallowing Zheng whole.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to meet, a huge finger suddenly fell onto the Ghost Altar!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>What could've been an epic showdown was promptly interrupted by the appearance of this sudden finger that separated both Zheng and the little dragon.</p>

  <p>It was a Great Ghost Priest!</p>

  <p>This Great Ghost Priest sported cyan skin and had eyes the shape of an inverted triangle. Two tusks protruded from his mouth and gave him an incredibly fierce look.</p>

  <p>As he stretched out his finger, the Treacherous Being within his body made its move.</p>

  <p>This finger that separated the two opponents came from the hatred-level Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>"Fighting is prohibited in the Ghost Altar," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest told them in an almost bored tone.</p>

  <p>His announcement made all the other Great Ghost Priests look at him strangely.</p>

  <p>Was there ever such a rule in place?</p>

  <p>The warriors from the many races on the Night View Island kept silent like a cicada in cold weather after they had entered the Ghost Mountain. There was no way they would dare break any rules here.</p>

  <p>They didn't even dare to speak loudly, let alone fight at the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Of course, the validity of this rule was still in question.</p>

  <p>In truth, these Great Ghost Priests hated humans especially Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi since they had the same appearance as the humans in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>If anything, they would be very happy to see these troublemakers die.</p>

  <p>The reason why they did not leave was because they personally wanted to see these humans die by the hands of these other fellows and send the news to the humans in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, even if a huge chunk of Great Ghost Priests hated humans, a small portion was in favor of them.</p>

  <p>This cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest was actually one of them.</p>

  <p>He was from the Jade Scale race and was a senior among the Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Claire couldn't believe that this Great Ghost Priest actually expected her to listen. Despite his warning, she simply redirected the little dragon so that it would be able to swallow Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was quite a big mistake. "Boom!"</p>

  <p>The huge finger pressed itself onto the little dragon's neck and nailed it onto the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Claire simply looked on as the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest glared at her coldly.</p>

  <p>Throughout the Night View Island's history, anybody who ever dared to go against a Great Ghost Priest ended up dead.</p>

  <p>As the finger held down the little dragon, it struggled desperately in the Ghost Altar and the fire scales that covered its body began to break under the immense pressure.</p>

  <p>There was no change in Claire's expression, meanwhile, the Eye Spirit decided to move.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I think this would interest you very much."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a wolf tooth began to emerge from the eyeball.</p>
