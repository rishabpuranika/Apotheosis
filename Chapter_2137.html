<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Evil thought that Zheng's origins and his status were both extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Although the Floating Island that was built by Mike years ago had collapsed, his disciples were still very active. Harold, Mike's chief disciple, was still a well-known figure in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, Master Evil didn't understand that Luo Zheng had stepped into the divine land like a headless fly, and almost got lost in the Vast Sky Region. Not only that, but he also stayed within a small mountain village in the north of the Vast Sky Region for a long time.</p>

  <p>Master Evil did not know that Luo Zheng had been sent to the Vast Sky Region because he had sneaked into the divine land. Wynn had carefully chosen the place to secure his first foothold since it was a small region, which didn't make it stand out much in the divine land. Furthermore, it was a relatively stable region, so it also wasn't too dangerous.</p>

  <p>The deep voice of Master Evil spoke, "I am a True God and the only goal of my life is to rule over a region. I used to be too bloody and ruthless, which is why I am called Master Evil. Right now, I am hopeless as I have fallen into this kind of situation. I am willing to give up this chance, but if you need my help, I will do my best to help."</p>

  <p>His usually sinister and vicious eyes were filled with sincerity as he spoke to Luo Zheng. It was truly shocking, especially if someone else had seen his expression.</p>

  <p>A faint smile danced across Zheng's lips. Although Master Evil's words were believable, he didn't have to take them seriously. He didn't completely believe that Master Evil didn't want to regain his body.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng wouldn't treat him shabbily in the future.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's expression suddenly changed. "Oh no!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>Back when Master Evil and Yorick had been in a fierce battle in Zheng's mind, the Stone Mouse had devoured Master Evil's belly and leapt down from his body. It looked like it had been longing for something, but now, its eyes were glued on Luo Zheng who as at the side of the cave. Its small, beady eyes were dim as it looked at him.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was just a world lord, the mouse thought that he was far from being as delicious as a True God, but he was still good food.</p>

  <p>Thus, the mouse dashed towards Luo Zheng once again at an incredible speed!</p>

  <p>"Run! The Stone Mouse is a one-of-a-kind true spirit.</p>

  <p>Even though it has just hatched, it still has a huge part of its strength from its previous life!" Master Evil nervously said in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It was known that many of the true spirits in the divine land were strange in form.</p>

  <p>The one-of-a-kind true spirit was really the only one of its kind in the divine land, just as its name suggested.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Stone Mouse was a unique being in the divine land.</p>

  <p>There was no second or other Stone Mice ever, so it could never reproduce. However, it had a miraculous ability of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>After it died, a strange mouse-shaped stone materialized in a large mountain in the divine land. This stone absorbed the vitality between heaven and earth for countless years, and then slowly evolved into the Stone Mouse--and that very mouse was in fact the reincarnation of the previous dead mouse. The reincarnated mouse possessed a large part of its strength from its previous life, which was why it was much stronger than even a mid-rank True God after it had hatched.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng was no match for the mouse given his current cultivation level.</p>

  <p>He had learned his lesson from what had happened to Yorick and Master Evil, so he hastily ran away. After a few moments, he quickly entered the hole beside the cave.</p>

  <p>"Run to the left!" Master Evil reminded Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was Master Evil who had carved the small cave in the past, so he knew the way around it very well.</p>

  <p>But even if Luo Zheng was by no means slow, mouse-type creatures were exceptionally swift--and the Stone Mouse was much faster than Luo Zheng when it chased after him.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>Because the mouse was blessed with the strength from its past life, it quickly chased after Luo Zheng without breaking much sweat. It let out sharp cries as it ran, which actually sounded a bit…playful?</p>

  <p>It climbed along the side of the small hole at an astonishing speed, and its distance from Luo Zheng continued to be closer.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the mouse was only three or four feet away from Luo Zheng. It stomped down with its tiny but powerful feet and immediately pounced at him!</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he attacked. He couldn't fly nor use the Grand Teleportation technique, and was left with no choice but his movement technique.</p>

  <p>Although the Stone Mouse was fast, it didn't expect that Luo Zheng had such an ingenious movement technique. It was why even if it had jumped towards him so quickly, he was able to move his body away as if it was a weightless piece of paper. The mouse continued to push Luo Zheng forward with its exposed tusks, and maintained a distance of a few inches from him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw this opportunity, he accelerated his speed and ran along the cave.</p>

  <p>Then again, the mouse was also extraordinarily intelligent. Ever since Luo Zheng had dodged its first pounce, it seemed to have seen through the ingenuity of the Eight Smoky Melodies. Therefore, it wasted no time in bouncing off the mountain wall and proceeded to pounce again from a different angle.</p>

  <p>The angle which the mouse launched itself forced Luo Zheng into a corner of the cave. While his Eight Smoky Melodies was indeed speedy as well, the technique required space for him to back off and avoid his opponent.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng was backed against the wall, he could only move in a horizontal direction along it. Just then, the Stone Mouse smoothly moved nearer to Luo Zheng and extended its two long, thin tusks towards his abdomen.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound, and it turned out that the mouse's tusks didn't penetrate Zheng's belly--but made contact with his Redemption Armor.</p>

  <p>While the True Gods had many ways to pierce through the Redemption Armor and subsequently injure Luo Zheng, his Redemption Armor had been made by Holy Drew. It was made from the source of the Godly Tile, which made it truly unbreakable.</p>

  <p>The mouse charged forward and attacked with its two tusks, but it seemed like it had just hit a steel plate. It couldn't injure Luo Zheng even in the slightest!</p>

  <p>"Your armor..."</p>

  <p>When Master Evil saw that Luo Zheng couldn't avoid the mouse after all, he thought that the young man would die. Thus, he was extremely surprised to see the unbelievable long robe Luo Zheng wore in action.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The cave was filled with the Stone Mouse's angry shrieks. It was frustrated as it also knew that Zheng's ordinary looking robe was indestructible. It continued to pounce again until it had actually went through the collar of Zheng's robe.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Redemption Armor could be moved according to his will and quickly covered his whole body at the most critical moments. However, the mouse's speed and reaction time continued to defy Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>Before he could cover his entire body with the Redemption Armor, he felt a sharp pain from his shoulder. The Stone Mouse had bitten him there!</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng's physical body was tougher than both Master Evil's and Yorick's. However, the Stone Mouse had some sort of theurgy, and even something as sturdy as Zheng's body couldn't stop it. Soon enough, the mouse was able to freely travel in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the mouse had drilled into Zheng's abdomen, and it was about to thrust its tusks into Zheng's elixir field.</p>

  <p>Just then, the black lines that wrapped around his elixir field suddenly glowed and enveloped the mouse's tusks. The black lines had successfully prevented the mouse from devouring Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The black lines were there to block the connection between Luo Zheng and his inner world.</p>

  <p>If the Stone Mouse wanted to drill into Zheng's elixir field, it would naturally have to cross the black lines first.</p>

  <p>However, the Stone Mouse had never seen such strange objects in any of the memories it inherited. Thus, the sight of the unfamiliar black lines caused it to be even more aggressive.</p>
