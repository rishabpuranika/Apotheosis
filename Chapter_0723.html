<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'Upper World?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng must've inherited the Fire Law there, ' Ning Yudie surmised in her heart.</p>

  <p>And her assumption was right. However, it wasn't just the Fire Law. What Ning Yudie had never expected was that Luo Luo Zheng had in fact mastered the nine Original Laws after his baptism by the laws.</p>

  <p>Although Brody had almost lost his mind, he could sense that the flame over Luo Zheng's palm was powerful. Despite that, he had no time to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Since he had been planted with blood runes by Lady Poison-blood, he had no other choice but to take Luo Luo Zheng out.</p>

  <p>His face distorted in a white-hot rage as he shouted, "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Brody rushed forward, a brown scimitar appearing in his hand. In a split second, scarlet, blood flames engulfed the entirety of the blade.</p>

  <p>He advanced at an alarming speed. In a blink of an eye, he was already poised above Luo Luo Zheng, ready to strike him down.</p>

  <p>"Blood Flame Hacking!"</p>

  <p>Blazing blood flames licked the scimitar's blade, adding more power to his attack. With the blood rune, Brody's moves were amplified to be tremendously overwhelming with each strike.</p>

  <p>However, just as he swung down his blade, Luo Luo Zheng was already gone, nimbly dodging his strike. Giving his opponent no time to react, Luo Luo Zheng quickly directed his flame towards Brody, striking his chest with his palm hard.</p>

  <p>"BANG!"</p>

  <p>Brody was sent back a few feet but was nonetheless standing. Finding his ground, he quickly swung his flaming scimitar at Luo Zheng's direction, aiming for the fire circle that surrounded him. As soon as his blood flame and Luo Zheng's fire collided, it started to devour each other.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng hadn't ever been exposed to any fire-system cultivation technique, he couldn't fully unleash the power of the flame he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>But, compared to the cultivation method, the comprehension of Law Power was more important. The flame Brody had released looked amazingly powerful but soon, it became apparent that he was at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Brody's blood flame was much weaker than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>If two cultivators practiced the Law Power of the same attribute, the one who had a better understanding of what they refined was stronger.</p>

  <p>It meant that Brody was comparatively weaker in Fire Law than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Brody was still a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm and he had intense willpower to win. The only thing that occupied his mind at that very moment was how to end Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Realizing his blood flame was now being controlled by Luo Luo Zheng, Brody had to think fast. He immediately bit the tip of his tongue and broke the skin. The familiar metallic taste of blood filled his mouth and he spat, the red liquid oozing from his tongue to his blade. The blood flames soared and managed to break free from Luo Zheng's fire circle. With his fire back, Brody roared, rushing forward with his scimitar, ready to swing down on his opponent.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the time he took to refine his body, Luo Luo Zheng was able to move swiftly, quickly moving aside to avoid Brody's strike.</p>

  <p>Having avoided his opponent, Luo Luo Zheng took a step backward and gave himself some distance as he steadied himself.</p>

  <p>The failure did not frustrate Brody. Rushing quickly towards Luo Luo Zheng, he once again swung his scimitar. "Blood Flame Hacking!" he shouted in fury.</p>

  <p>Seeing Brody's rushing figure, Luo Luo Zheng focused power on his legs. Looking up at his opponent, Luo Luo Zheng zoomed forward to meet him halfway, his right fist raised at the ready.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Each punch pierced and echoed through the air as Luo Luo Zheng attacked Brody with full strength.</p>

  <p>His punches were calculated and extremely strong, so strong that the sound of Brody's bones breaking could be heard as his fists landed upon his body.</p>

  <p>This went on for a bit before Luo Luo Zheng was satisfied and stopped punching Brody. He stood up and retreated from where he had originally been standing. Meanwhile, Brody was on his knees, struggling to rise after Luo Zheng's assault. He clutched at his chest in pain and sent a resentful glare full of bitterness to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, glaring was all he managed to do as Brody suddenly collapsed on the ground a few seconds later.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng won," Tianming, who was among the audience, said with a subtle smile.</p>

  <p>Lewis heaved a long sigh of relief. "He scared the hell out of me! I'm so glad he won. If he lost, I would lose everything," he said, patting his chest.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and remarked, "He's much stronger than I have imagined. He even mastered the Fire Law. Ah, really, this guy?"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many, Tianming was already considered a terrifying genius, but he suddenly regarded Luo Luo Zheng as a more talented cultivator than him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether Luo Luo Zheng intends to win first place, but as far as I know, he is very much likely to get into the top ten," Patrick claimed.</p>

  <p>After having defeated his opponent, Luo Luo Zheng remained still and composed. Once Mr. Xiao announced the results and summoned him, he came forward to draw a card.</p>

  <p>'Please God? I hope I can choose. Please let me choose my next opponent!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng prayed to himself. Slowly, he turned the card over and almost shouted for joy. It seemed God was listening and answered his prayer. He was very much eager to end Marilyn's life, and according to the match rules, he could now fight with her if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>However, if he did that, Eddie might suspect his identity. It would be wiser to postpone his plans.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, Luo Luo Zheng put the card aside and returned to the area for the independent warriors.</p>

  <p>The contest continued on.</p>

  <p>After several rounds, the difference between the independent warriors and sect disciples was evident in terms of real strength.</p>

  <p>Most independent warriors were too weak to fight against the sect disciples.</p>

  <p>Two of the independent warriors, however, captured the audience's attention with their excellent performance. One of them was Owen who was at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm while the other was called Trevor Huangfu.</p>

  <p>The two independent warriors were able to knock down two top talented disciples: one from the Mysterious Luna Hall and the other from the Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>The two of them did not belong to any sect.</p>

  <p>Most of the cultivators that had passed the pre-qualifying match came from third-grade sects, but Owen and Trevor were different. They were not given any guidance or wisdom from their masters, nor did they learn any kind of secret refinement method from some sect. Both had entered the Martial Arts Contest armed only with their luck and real strength.</p>
