<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Witnessing their chief flick away the volley of arrows as though they were but toothpicks, the rest of the Star Falcon race cheered.</p>

  <p>"The Myriad Spirits City is still weak!"</p>

  <p>"They are too weak! This city should have been occupied by our Star Falcon race long ago!"</p>

  <p>"You know nothing! The best way is to control it through the Dark Bear race. There is no need for us to take over this city!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Star Falcon race cackled amongst themselves as they flew towards the city wall. The Star Falcon race thought very highly of themselves, and had always belittled the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>So it had piqued their curiosity when their chief decided to gather all their forces just to kill two human targets.</p>

  <p>This was unacceptable-- beneath them, really.</p>

  <p>Due to their relationship with the Jin Wu, the Star Falcon race had always protected the Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. And these two races also enjoyed a high status in the Sky Water City, but even so, the Star Falcon race still thought lowly of humans.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the humans were weak. But their human targets had even bodies on the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>"Aoo!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Hans let out a high pitched cry, commanding his troops to strike back.</p>

  <p>Obeying their chief, all the Star Falcons spread out their wings in unison.</p>

  <p>The diamond embedded in their chests glowed, emitting a trace of star radiance that formed a ring.</p>

  <p>This ring grew bigger and bigger, till it was as big as their massive bodies.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From within the ring, thousands of long and thin light swords with star radiance shot out towards the city wall. These swords were several times more powerful than the green arrows shot by the mole crickets!</p>

  <p>Squeak! "Activate the array!" Clyde ordered promptly.</p>

  <p>In no time, several Guide Weasels hiding in the darkness activated the array that was arranged on the city wall.</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel race had lived in the Myriad Spirits City since time immemorial. Over the years, they had planted arrays in the city. One, in particular, was the Heavenly Harmony Array at the front of the city. This array had been gifted to them a long time ago by an ancient civilization.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A thick, white fog rose from the ground, enshrouding the whole city wall.</p>

  <p>Once the Star Falcons' swords pierced the fog, it was as though they had landed in jelly. The long, thin swords then abruptly turned around, and shot back from whence they came.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"The white fog is sending our starry swords back!"</p>

  <p>"Split up!"</p>

  <p>The Star Falcons that had been soaring in the air panicked, and anxiously spread out to dodge the swords shooting back at them. Amazingly, no one got hurt.</p>

  <p>"Chief, what should we do?"</p>

  <p>"The array they're using is strange... How did they bounce back our starry swords!"</p>

  <p>However, Hans just snorted at them. Impatiently, he let out another piercing cry.</p>

  <p>"Keep attacking!"</p>

  <p>This order confused many Star Falcons. But since it was given by their chief, they just obeyed, and continued to form more starry rings, shooting more starry swords towards the city.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Facing the second volley of thin swords, the Giants standing on the city wall laughed.</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that the Star Falcon race was the strongest race in Stage Fourteen. However, this battle seemed to be proving that fact wrong.</p>

  <p>How could the Star Falcon race be so foolish as to launch the same attack once more? Undoubtedly, these starry swords would be bounced back to the sky by the Heavenly Harmony Array again, no matter how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>The instant the starry swords fell, a tearing sound suddenly came from below the city wall.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With a burst of roars coming from the bottom of the city wall, a great number of creatures in green armor drilled out from the ground. They were from the Mountain Breaking race. They had lived in the Sky Water City and followed the Star Falcon race since a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Back when the Dark Bear race was in charge of the City Guard House, the Star Falcon race had already dug out all the secrets of the Myriad Spirits City. Of course they'd been expecting the Heaven Harmony Array!</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race launching attacks from the sky was actually a distraction. In order to let the Mountain Breaking race sneak in from underground, they were willing to risk looking foolish.</p>

  <p>Alas, the array's foundation was destroyed. The white fog that had been shrouding the city dissipated into thin air. Then, the starry swords shot down like heavy rain.</p>

  <p>A Giant who had been smirking just seconds prior was suddenly impaled by a starry sword, falling to the ground with a heavy thud. Pained cries filled the air as other creatures were being shot.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Raul brandished a thick metal club. The club shadows covered Luo Zheng's and Feng Ge's heads, smashing the starry swords that fell on this area into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Sir! The Heavenly Harmony Array has been destroyed. We have to retreat!" Clyde said urgently.</p>

  <p>The biggest advantage of the Star Falcon race was that they could fly.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Giants were good at head-on combat, whereas the Guide Weasels were good at sneaky assassination. Neither of the two races had a chance against the enemy they were facing now.</p>

  <p>Click! Click! Click!</p>

  <p>As each of the starry swords dropped, it would pierce the city wall, leaving a deep gash. In the blink of an eye, the city wall was already riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>"If we retreat, we can't kill them," Luo Zheng said firmly, staring at the Star Falcons in the sky.</p>

  <p>"If they want to occupy the Myriad Spirits City, they will have to land first.</p>

  <p>Only then will we have a chance!" Clyde analyzed.</p>

  <p>"Clyde's right. But their target is the two of you," echoed Raul, who stood nearby.</p>

  <p>Although they were full of fighting spirit, they were keenly aware that they couldn't fight against the Star Falcon race without the Heavenly Harmony Array. It was reasonable for them to retreat first.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to retreat," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge gently asked, "Do you want me to send you up?"</p>

  <p>"Okay." Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge suddenly yanked the metal club from Raul's hands, leaving him stunned.</p>

  <p>A mighty creature like Raul should've been able to respond quickly, since he regarded his weapon as important as his own life.</p>

  <p>But even if Raul had been quick enough to respond, in that moment, he had felt an incredible power from Feng Ge's slender arms. There was no way he could've resisted. The metal club was instantly taken away by Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge then raised the metal club towards the sky, and Luo Zheng jumped onto it.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>From Feng Ge's fingers erupted a powerful force, which was channeled through the club, shooting Luo Zheng thousands of feet into the air.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's body was any weaker, this strike would've destroyed his body.</p>

  <p>Raul was absolutely dumbfounded. Even the residual force from the smash hurt his face. But Luo Zheng was able to withstand it. How strong was this man?</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng shot into the sky, a pair of thunder wings appeared on his back.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Feng Ge's little trick, Luo Zheng flew like a flash of lightning.</p>

  <p>Before the Star Falcons had the time to react, they heard a thunderous roar and then felt a heavy blow on their chests. Disgruntled, they lost their balance and plunged to the ground.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body had suddenly turned into a lightning arc in the air, hitting Star Falcons one after another without a break. Once his body arc hit a Star Falcon, it would plummet down, a black mark seared on the chest.</p>

  <p>In about ten seconds, more than twenty Star Falcons had already plunged to their deaths, most of which were elites!</p>

  <p>The rest of the Star Falcons were shocked. Hans, shaking his head, tried to gather his wits.</p>
