<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not dare to underestimate these four Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>The power of the dragon scales had reached a terrifying level. An ordinary Soul Sea Realm warrior would have been torn into pieces if he was hit by that powerfully infused palm!</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng was leaning against the wall, his heart was filled to the brim with a competitive spirit!</p>

  <p>Both of them possessed the power of the dragon scales, but he wanted to see just who had the strongest power!</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon on the Taming Dragon Arhat's shoulder was very remarkable indeed. It was a pity that Luo Luo Zheng was in the Illusion Battlefield, for although he could use the power of his dragon scales, he could not let the cyan dragon's soul project inside. In the Illusion Battlefield he was unable to communicate with the cyan dragon, and in the same way, he could use the sword spirit, but he was also unable to communicate with Xun. Even if he summoned the sword spirit, Xun's soul was not within it. Luo Luo Zheng was fighting on his own in here, and could not consult with either the cyan dragon or Xun, upon whose counsel he had come to rely greatly.</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng did not hesitate further. The nearest Taming Dragon Arhat was already rushing towards him, and as the Arhat clapped its hands, the Genuine Dragon on its shoulder began to shine with a green light, and the power of dragon scales poured into the arhat statue!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng weaved his hands, the power of the dragon scales also surged into his body. Without the slightest intention of dodging, he also stretched out both of his palms, readying himself to face the charge.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Taming Dragon Arhat's two palms also stretched out, but were accompanied by the sound of the dragon's roar. The stone sculpture of the Genuine Dragon on the Arhat's shoulder also raised its head and roared, adding its voice to the charge. The momentum created seemed even more formidable.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, two sets of palms slammed into each other!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a loud booming rumble, Luo Zheng's body was once again cast backwards upon impact.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng flew backwards, he felt that his blood was roiling and he also felt extremely uncomfortable. The power of the Taming Dragon Arhat was indeed extraordinary!</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng was sent flying, so was the Taming Dragon Arhat.</p>

  <p>If the Taming Dragon Arhat had just been an ordinary Buddha statue, Luo Luo Zheng would surely have smashed the Arhat into powder with the might of his palm strike.</p>

  <p>But the Taming Dragon Arhat was several times stronger and fiercer than the previous sculptures that Luo Luo Zheng had encountered. After all, the body of the Taming Dragon Arhat had to withstand the power of the dragon scales from the Genuine Dragon's statue. If the Arhat's body was not strong or firm enough, it might collapse before the formidable power was released into it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's previous physical body too could not bear much power of the dragon scales. If he had forcefully channeled the power of the dragon scales into his body, his physical body would have collapsed first.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Two loud echoes reverberated within the adytum.</p>

  <p>The sounds had been caused by Luo Luo Zheng and the Taming Dragon Arhat that had both crashed into the adytum's walls when they were hurled backwards.</p>

  <p>The Taming Dragon Arhat had smashed into the wall with tremendous force. Following that huge impact of the collision, there were now numerous thick cracks zigzagging over the Arhat's body, which seemed to have been unable to withstand the collision and was about to collapse!</p>

  <p>However, the golden Buddhist light began to leak out from the cracks like heavenly blood. Then the area which had been cracked was being repaired at a high rate. In an instant, the cracks closed up, and naturally the golden Buddhist light disappeared as well...</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng was more seriously injured after the collision, and he was busy spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>

  <p>"The Arhat can recover?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the reconstruction of the Taming Dragon Arhat, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but frown in disappointment. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, but didn't have the chance to think about it, because the three other Taming Dragon Arhats were also striking towards him. Each of them had a Genuine Dragon on its body, and all of the dragon scales on the Genuine Dragons' bodies were flashing with light...</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really was beaten by the three Taming Dragon Arhats, even if he didn't die in the physical world, he would still be seriously injured!</p>

  <p>Following the impact of that collision, Luo Luo Zheng had actually beaten a retreat to a corner of the adytum. As the Arhats approached, Luo Luo Zheng once again clenched his teeth and penetrated through space to instantly bypass the three Taming Dragon Arhats and materialize at another corner!</p>

  <p>'This is a little troublesome, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought and frowned.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Luo Zheng didn't have a better way to deal with them. If he was unable to defeat them with his own strength, he could of course make use of other methods!</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng raised his head slightly...</p>

  <p>At this moment, there were three hundred celestial stars shining in the sky!</p>

  <p>These three hundred stars were located in different Sky Regions, including the Middle Sky Region, the Western Sky Region, the Southern Sky Region, the Northern Sky Region, and the Eastern Sky Region!</p>

  <p>Upon being summoned by Luo Luo Zheng, they all began to emit dense and glisten starlight which immediately blazed towards the supreme world where the Illusion Battlefield was. Being able to trigger these three hundred stars was one of Luo Zheng's achievements which he had accomplished after these past years of cultivation.</p>

  <p>Actually, Luo Luo Zheng knew with confidence that he could deal with the four Taming Dragon Arhats if he used the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had decided to make use of the Stellar Body at this moment just to verify his own speculations...</p>

  <p>When the glittering starlight started to gather around Luo Luo Zheng, he had already discovered the answer.</p>

  <p>'So it really is like that. This Illusion Battlefield is actually not a real Illusion Space, but a supreme world that has originally existed in this universe... Otherwise, it might have been difficult for me to draw upon the power of the stars here!' Luo Luo Zheng mused.</p>

  <p>There were many stars in the universe that were able to add their illumination to this place. Luo Luo Zheng could make sure of that now.</p>

  <p>The power of the Stellar Body was enough to have become one of Luo Zheng's trump cards, so in these six years, Luo Luo Zheng had not relented on communicating with the stars. He had even spent a lot of time engaging in cultivating the Stellar Body. If he couldn't have made use of this cultivation method in the Illusion Battlefield, it would have been a great loss to him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng found that his worry was unfounded. At least, for the time being he could successfully condense the starlight and use its raw energy!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's body was now coated with a layer of magnificent multicolored starlight, he once again charged straight at the Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>The Arhat that had previously been fractured into pieces by Luo Luo Zheng had completely recovered. At this moment, the four Taming Dragon Arhats were all standing in a row, uniformly putting their palms together.</p>

  <p>"Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!"</p>

  <p>There were four mighty roars of the dragons ringing out!</p>

  <p>The four Genuine Dragons on the four Taming Dragon Arhats' bodies all roared at the same time!</p>

  <p>Green rays of light burst forth, making it difficult for anyone to see much of anything.</p>

  <p>How terrifying were the forces contained within their eight palms?</p>

  <p>True to his nature, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to retreat or dodge...</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had other methods to deal more effectively with them, but he also knew that the Illusion Battlefield had just opened, and he would be facing the entire universe's ace talents. He couldn't underestimate the other Soul Sea Realm talents! Over the past few years, even Layla of the Mist Palace had grown by leaps and bounds, and Luo Luo Zheng might not be able to beat her now. Besides, there were also many ace talents from the Blessed Buddha Land, the Thoughtless Minds, the Demon Night, the ogre race, and the other races in the universe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng needed a test to check the fruits of his years of cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Strands of starlight began to flash into Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>The shapes of the starlight were like cottons floating into his hands. They looked weightless, but the power contained within them could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The three hundred beams of starlight mixed together, with a great multitude of varying colors: crimson, orange, yellow, green, white, purple, blue, and red. Those gorgeous colors fused together and formed a motley rainbow of starlight, but as a result they were becoming extremely unstable!</p>

  <p>After this multicolored mass of starlight had formed, Luo Luo Zheng immediately shot it out. If he hesitated for even three seconds, Luo Luo Zheng would probably have been swept up in it too and been devoured by the might of this starlight!</p>

  <p>"Multiple Stars Brilliance!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz?"</p>

  <p>A deafeningly sharp sound exploded from the multicolored starlight!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the mass of starlight arrived in front of the four Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>"Explode!"</p>

  <p>This condensed mass of starlight contained the intense power of three hundred stars. When it erupted and exploded, the different kinds of power were repelled and fused with each other. The starlight emitted was extremely powerful and shocking!</p>

  <p>The entire adytum was covered in the blinding starlight, making it impossible for anyone to clearly see the situation within!</p>

  <p>However, the massive golden Buddha within the depths of the ancient temple opened his eyes and stared intently at the adytum, with an indifferent expression on his great, rounded face.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha saw that the four Taming Dragon Arhats were constantly shattering, and that the stone sculptures of the four Genuine Dragons on the Arhats' shoulders were also beginning to shatter... Even though the strands of golden light inside their bodies actively tried to repair their bodies, the light had immediately been destroyed by the starlight the moment it had appeared...</p>

  <p>"The Taming Dragon Arhats cannot be killed. Help me test this guy. I want to see just how much of the Emotion Closing Godly Way he has mastered..."</p>

  <p>After speaking, the golden giant Buddha waved the lotus in his left hand, and with a golden flash, the Taming Dragon Arhats, which were supposed to have been destroyed, had all recovered!</p>
