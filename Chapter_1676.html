<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In terms of pure destructive power, no weapon in the whole universe could surpass the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>However, in the Emerald Dream, it was instantly blocked by Cindy's outstretched finger.</p>

  <p>The tip of her finger touched the glittering spear tip, and the deadly spear was unable to make even an inch headway.</p>

  <p>"Pure strength is useless in the Emerald Dream," Cindy said with a teasing smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze suddenly focused and the power of the dragon scales within his body instantly burst out through every cell in his body. In the wink of an eye, he seemed to have activated the incalculable power of ten thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>However, it was still useless.</p>

  <p>When the tip of the spear touched Cindy's fingertip, it did not even scratch her skin.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng did not hesitate even for a heartbeat. He pushed off the ground and hurriedly retreated backwards.</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, a gigantic spear shadow plunged forward.</p>

  <p>When the spear shadow shot out, it could kill ordinary ace talents with a single strike if they were not nimble enough to dodge in time.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng himself were to receive the spear head-on, he probably wouldn't have withstood its onslaught either.</p>

  <p>However, a peach blossom slowly tumbled down and coincidentally passed in front of Cindy, blocking the spear shadow.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The peach blossom violently split open.</p>

  <p>The spear shadow formed by the Shadowy Spin was also instantly annihilated by the soft and succulent petal, while Cindy remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>"In this dream, you are no match for me," she said as she continued to advance forward.</p>

  <p>This exceedingly beautiful woman could instantly control everything in the Emerald Dream. This was her moment, and Luo Zheng was left helpless, or so it seemed.</p>

  <p>She had created this dream. She had constructed the intricate rules for this fantasy. She was therefore the ruler of this enchantment.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful was the Saint Killing Spear? It had destroyed the rules of the Illusion Battlefield to a certain extent, but here in this dream, it could not injure even her fingertip.</p>

  <p>'So pure strength is useless, ' Luo Zheng thought as he narrowed his eyes in speculation and took a step back.</p>

  <p>'If I can't break free from this Emerald Dream, I will lose without a doubt.'</p>

  <p>Being eliminated now?!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never even contemplated this possibility.</p>

  <p>However, how could he destroy the dream? He had no clue at this moment.</p>

  <p>"I love the Emerald Dream the most as it is conceived from peach blossoms. Isn't this dream beautiful?" Cindy continued to maneuver closer to Luo Zheng. "Actually, the very instant that you entered my dream, you already lost. Now surrender!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng retreated rapidly.</p>

  <p>However, Cindy only needed to take one step to close the distance between them.</p>

  <p>This wasn't because she had used the Space Law. She was only strolling forward casually.</p>

  <p>Cindy was able to move across space without using the Space Law because she was the ruler of the Emerald Dream. Since this was her creation, she was omnipotent.</p>

  <p>"Admit defeat!" said Cindy with a sweet smile.</p>

  <p>How was Luo Zheng willing to admit defeat?</p>

  <p>At this moment, a plan occurred to him, and he stuffed the spear into his space ring and suddenly jumped up.</p>

  <p>However, before he could even raise his body, she gently brushed against it with her hand.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>It was as if an invisible, sledge hammer had smashed into Zheng's body, causing him to plummet from the sky.</p>

  <p>"It's useless. There is no escape from my Emerald Dream." Cindy shook her head. "This dream has such beautiful vistas, I don't want to ruin it with bloodshed and violence. Just admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>Her personality had undergone a complete transformation.</p>

  <p>Outside the dream, she was a shy girl. But inside the dream, she had become a completely different person. Her Mu Ning had become extremely strong and boasted a tremendous confidence.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Our Cindy is toying with this brat, like a cat with a mouse."</p>

  <p>"He simply doesn't have the strength to offer resistance. They are not on the same level of accomplishment."</p>

  <p>"Cindy's Emerald Dream is too powerful. Not only Luo Zheng, but I guess that even Nathan would be defeated by her."</p>

  <p>At this moment, relaxed smiles appeared on the faces of the warriors from the Ji Clan. They had been slightly fretful before. But now, it appeared that Luo Zheng had no way of fighting back, and the end was a foregone conclusion. They could now see that Cindy had made great progress in cultivating the Dream Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Janet looked at everything that was happening in the Emerald Dream, her eyes flashing with an undetectable light.</p>

  <p>'Cindy has indeed become a lot stronger.</p>

  <p>But I don't think Luo Zheng is to be discounted yet. He is not that easy to deal with, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>Even if Cindy had the absolute advantage, Janet knew that it was not a given that she would win.</p>

  <p>Of course, she hoped that Cindy would win this match. After all, Janet and Cindy were both members of the Ji Clan, and although Luo Zheng had helped her before, he was still an outsider in the end.</p>

  <p>But Janet also knew Luo Zheng was not to be trifled with, and she was not sure that he would be so easily eliminated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng crawled up to his knees and then rose shakily from the ground.</p>

  <p>When he heard Cindy's words, he firmly shook his head and said, "Your dream is indeed very powerful, but there is always a way to break it."</p>

  <p>"Anyone who enters my dream is instantly controlled by me. You don't understand yet, just how powerful the Emerald Dream is," Cindy said with confidence.</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, she gently shook her head, like a mother who was about to discipline her unruly child.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an invisible force exploded and once again impacted with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A loud noise rang out as the force connected with Luo Zheng, sending him flying to the side.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was launched across space by that power and landed thousands of feet away. As soon as he landed in a crumpled heap on the ground, an invisible force covered in peach blossoms suddenly rose from the ground and brutally smashed him into the air.</p>

  <p>He was like a rag doll being tossed about at will by Cindy.</p>

  <p>"In the end, Luo Zheng is only another warrior, who ascended from the Lower World. He won't be able to deal with Cindy, and I actually bet on him.</p>

  <p>Alas! I'm going to lose all of my money."</p>

  <p>"It's all because everyone believed that he'd be eliminated in the very first round that his odds are high. However, his failure is inevitable. You thought that he was a dark horse. But how could there be so many dark horses? This fellow has the strength of an ace talent, and he should content himself with that. Surely, that is lucky enough. Compared to a true first-rate warrior, there is still quite a large gap between them."</p>

  <p>"It's said that Cindy is only ranked fourth in the Thoughtless Minds. Luo Zheng can't even deal with her. What if he met Lucille? And what if he met Lawson? You bet on Luo Zheng winning? I think you must have been dreaming!"</p>

  <p>When the warriors in the universe saw Luo Zheng being ravaged like this, most of them could only shake their heads in pity and felt their disregard for Luo Zheng increase.</p>

  <p>The strength of a major power was illustrated by those Godly Geniuses and ace talents. Luo Zheng was far from being their match.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body felt like it was being held in the hands of an invisible giant who threw him around like a child's toy. Weakened by the constant onslaught, Luo Zheng didn't even seem to have the strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning called out. Her eyebrows rose up in concern.</p>

  <p>Streams of purple light lingered around her. She actually wanted to break away from the stone she was standing on.</p>

  <p>Although she knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't really die even if he was killed in the battle, she still couldn't stand to watch him being played around with like this.</p>

  <p>However, the instant that she released the streams of purple light, a powerful binding force emanated from the black stone, subduing the purple light.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry! Luo Zheng won't be defeated that easily," Tianming, who was standing beside her, assured her.</p>

  <p>Fighting against the rules of the heavens was not a wise choice. It would just be a waste of effort and might lead to her being eliminated.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning didn't even bother to listen to Tianming, for all she could think about was helping her man.</p>

  <p>The streams of purple light continued to gush from her, and sword shadows spread out from them.</p>

  <p>She actually planned to fight against the binding power of the black stone.</p>

  <p>The streams of purple light that had escaped from Margaret's body were originally bound to a distance of about three inches from her, but as they continued to expand, they gradually began to spread beyond the boundaries of the black stone.</p>

  <p>When he saw this, Tianming was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound rang out from the trembling black stone beneath her feet.</p>

  <p>A crack had actually appeared on the black stone!</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone's attention was locked onto the Heaven Earth Board, and they were oblivious to what was happening off to the side, where Mu Ning was standing.</p>

  <p>As they heard the cracking sound, all of the viewers instantly turned their attention to Mu Ning. Even the ace talents and Godly Geniuses were also startled by this new development.</p>

  <p>'This woman actually broke the black stone? This is unbelievable!'</p>

  <p>It had been an immutable rule that after each stone landed, no one was able to move them, except for the woman in pink.</p>

  <p>Even though the previous battles had been rather fierce, and sometimes destroyed the board, no one had been able to move the stones.</p>

  <p>But this woman was actually able to crack this stone!</p>

  <p>The purple light around Mu Ning was getting thicker and thicker, and the range it was spreading across was also increasing. If this continued, she would truly be able to break free from the black stone and charge into the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>"Alas!"</p>

  <p>A soft sigh quietly whispered through the air.</p>

  <p>Soon after, faint rings of light appeared around the black stone.</p>

  <p>The rings of light were layered, one over the other, binding Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Yet, even these rings of light weren't able to fully resist the purple light.</p>

  <p>They were slowly being corroded by the purple light.</p>

  <p>Shock appeared in the eyes of the crowd. Even Nathan and the other warriors would not have been able to do such a thing. The woman in pink had actually made a move herself, yet she was unable to completely restrain Mu Ning. Such was the power of the purple light.</p>

  <p>What on earth was her purple light made of? What was its origin?</p>

  <p>However, as the purple light corroded the rings of light, the layers of the rings of light simply increased and surrounded her. The speed at which Mu Ning was using the purple light to subdue the rings of light was far inferior to the speed at which the rings of light were created.</p>

  <p>In theory, it was still impossible for Mu Ning to escape from the black stone.</p>
