<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1267 They Met Again </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The inner disciple's face reflected his arrogance and craziness, his attacks getting fiercer by the minute.</p>

  <p>But a greenish gray aura remained on the surface of Nory's body. His opponent wouldn't be able to knock him down even if he let out a shower of attacks against him.</p>

  <p>The aura seemed unique, indicating that perhaps Nory had had his own fortuitous encounters.</p>

  <p>"Nory, you can do it!"</p>

  <p>"You can't lose to this guy from Skytop Peak!"</p>

  <p>"Defend our dignity! We are the Number One peak!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at the crowd's cheers. This battle was between the Skytop Peak and the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>The Drizzle Peak had ranked first back when Zheng had defeated Tianming and Patrick. Tianming was from the Skytop Peak, which ended up second.</p>

  <p>It was completely unexpected that this situation had remained the same to this day.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Nory had blocked many of his opponent's attacks, but one finally made it through to hit him and sent him flying to the edge of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>The black-robed disciple sneered as he walked towards Nory. He raised the weapon in his hand and asked, "Are you going to roll off yourself, or should I help you with it?"</p>

  <p>Nory gritted his teeth and then stubbornly clenched his jaw. The life vitality within his body began to gather. Despite his disadvantage, he still wanted to retaliate.</p>

  <p>"Looks like you won't give up. I'll simply have to disable you then!" The disciple of the Skytop Peak sneered again, raised the weapon in his hand and was about to smash it down on him.</p>

  <p>A voice sounded from across the crowd. "Enough!"</p>

  <p>The crowd parted as a woman made her way to the front. She was wearing a yellow waistcoat over a light yellow dress that accentuated her slim figure. Her face was as beautiful as a fairy's, but it had been four years and she had become more mature.</p>

  <p>"Master Su!" Zheng murmured as his eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Aura did not see him as he was floating in the air. She walked up to the side of the battle ring and said to Nory, "You've done well enough.</p>

  <p>Surrender, Nory."</p>

  <p>"But Master Su— " Nory hesitated, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Aura smiled and said, "This is not perseverance, but recklessness. A warrior should know when to surrender."</p>

  <p>As she looked at Nory, Aura was reminded of Zheng. After all, not everyone had talent like Zheng's. While perseverance was a very important quality, it was only when used together with talent that one could achieve the greatest of heights.</p>

  <p>But it looked like Aura's words didn't have an effect on Nory, who stood up and charged at his opponent.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death! Since you refuse to admit defeat, I will disable you!" The inner disciple sneered again as he increased his speed. He landed a lightning-fast kick at Nory, knocking him to the ground, and then raised his fist and punched his belly.</p>

  <p>Aura frowned. She wanted to stop him, but she was still too slow.</p>

  <p>A figure flashed out of the sky and landed inside the battle ring. He gently pushed the inner disciple away from Nory.</p>

  <p>At this push, the inner disciple felt a force that he could not resist, and stumbled a dozen steps backwards before coming to a stop. He stared darkly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nory had originally thought that he was going to suffer a miserable defeat, but this figure had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. He raised his head to look at the figure in white, but his expression quickly morphed into one of utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>"It's... you!" Nory didn't know how to address Zheng in that moment.</p>

  <p>A few inner disciples, led by Wurth, emerged from the crowd.</p>

  <p>They had also been watching the fight between Nory and the inner disciple, but they hadn't expected anyone to appear and interfere with the fight. Wurth and Zheng were familiar with each other, and though Zheng's temperament had changed, Wurth was still able to recognize him after years of not having seen him.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"It's really Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng is back!"</p>

  <p>At first, many disciples of the Drizzle Peak hadn't recognized Zheng, but after someone had shouted his name for the first time, it seemed like everyone had awakened from a deep slumber. The mountain seemed to boil with excitement.</p>

  <p>The name Zheng was the glory of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Any news of Zheng's presence in the Central Region was always relayed to Drizzle Peak and spread throughout the Cloud Sect and the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" The inner disciple of the Skytop Peak was evidently shocked. The person standing before him was the strongest warrior in the Central Region. And he used to be one of the disciples of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Aura trembled as she saw Zheng. She stared at him for a few seconds before she turned on her heel and walked away, disappearing into the crowd.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed Aura's movement and hurriedly pulled Nory off the ground.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he followed Aura, calling after her.</p>

  <p>Aura was wearing embroidered shoes with silk flowers that she didn't bother about as she quickly walked forward. She did not know where she was going, but she wanted to leave this place.</p>

  <p>"Master Su!" Zheng chased after Aura and shouted.</p>

  <p>Aura looked straight ahead, her expression cold and distant. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear before shaking her head and saying, "I am no longer your master."</p>

  <p>Zheng had been promoted to become one of the disciples of the Cloud Hall a long time ago, which meant that she couldn't be considered his master anymore.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled playfully and said, "Alright. I'll call you Aura."</p>

  <p>"I used to be your master, and I'm older than you. How can you call me by my name?" Aura said coldly, still facing away from him.</p>

  <p>"Then how about... Sister Aura?" Zheng smiled, relaxing a little.</p>

  <p>Aura did not reply.</p>

  <p>When Kenneth had entered the royal palace and kicked Ray off the throne, Aura had guessed that one of two things had happened.</p>

  <p>Either Zheng or Kane had returned.</p>

  <p>She hadn't had to wait too long before she got her answer. She had heard of Zheng's various achievements in the Central Region. He was comparable to any talent of a fourth or fifth-grade sect. He had been able to suppress all the talents from the Central Region when he was at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>At that time, Aura had had many choices laid out before her. Kenneth respected her choice and no matter what she wanted to do, he would try his best to cooperate.</p>

  <p>But she had given up.</p>

  <p>She had returned to Drizzle Peak and was quietly serving as a master.</p>

  <p>In fact, deep down, Aura knew that she was waiting, but what she was waiting for, she did not know. Or perhaps, she did not dare admit to herself.</p>

  <p>The path of cultivation was an extremely long one. Zheng had now stepped into a new level, a level that she couldn't even hope to reach.</p>

  <p>However, she was still waiting and focusing all her energy on the Drizzle Peak, hoping to find more talented disciples, giving them the greatest help, and hoping for a better result. Only by doing so, would she be able to be patient for a little longer.</p>

  <p>Four years wasn't a long time, and she hadn't thought that Zheng would come back. In these four years, she had heard that Zheng had offended a strong warrior from the Central Region, gone missing, returned, looked for a capable doctor, and then left the Central Region for a foreign land that was far beyond her imagination, in order to save the leader of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Region was too far away from the Central Region, and the information had not been transmitted smoothly. This meant that every emotion stayed with Aura for a long time until the next message was sent, before being replaced by another emotion, be it excitement, worry, hope, relief, or gratification.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had returned today! 'Have I been waiting for him?' she asked herself. Her mind was a mess. She could not think straight and did not know the answer.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, her body trembled, as a pair of hands wrapped around her.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" Aura said, nervousness lacing her voice.</p>

  <p>She was still a master, even if she was not that older than the disciples of Drizzle Peak. Many disciples on the mountainside were looking at her.</p>

  <p>She felt embarrassed and shy.</p>

  <p>At her words, Zheng hugged her even tighter and didn't let go for a long time. "I'm sorry I'm late," he said apologetically.</p>

  <p>He had promised that he would come back.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Drizzle Peak, Margaret and Yudie were hiding behind a rock. Margaret smiled and said, "Look! I guessed right."</p>
