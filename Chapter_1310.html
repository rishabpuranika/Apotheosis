  <p>
</p>

  <p>The seven warriors who had reached the Soul Sea Realm were left wondering if they had heard wrongly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they were also wondering just where the chill had come from. It wasn't so scary just now.</p>

  <p>They had been either rulers of some divine kingdoms or leaders of sacred places of sixth or seventh grade in the Lower World. Such places weren't exactly full of Life and Death Realm people but these guys had seen their fair share of them.</p>

  <p>And from their very foundation, they always looked down on Life and Death Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>Now, they saw that this young man at the Life and Death Realm looked like he wanted to have a fight here.</p>

  <p>Where did he find the courage? How could he even hope to fight seven martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm alone?</p>

  <p>Was he crazy? He was clearly biting off more than he could chew.</p>

  <p>Thinking about that, the seven Soul Sea Realm martial artists burst into a mocking laughter.</p>

  <p>Freya, who was standing beside Luo Zheng, was also dumbfounded. She really did not know what made Luo Zheng so confident and had no idea what the hell he was trying to do, except that he would die. Could it be that Luo Zheng had someone backing him? Wait, no! That was impossible! If Luo Zheng had a backer in the Upper World, why would he want to mine here? He would have been taken away long ago.</p>

  <p>However, although Freya was very confused, she still looked calm. Luo Zheng had already shown his incredible skills in front of her twice. Could it be that he had a way to deal with these Soul Sea Realm martial artists too, just like he had dealt with all their problems before now? On second thought, with Zheng's cultivation, he probably wouldn't have any chance of victory. Thus, although she looked calm, she was actually very anxious.</p>

  <p>While laughing uncontrollably, the martial artists were also staring at Luo Zheng with derisive eyes. The one named Ernest, their leader, was laughing so hard that he couldn't even breathe. But at the end, a vicious sneer curled the corners of his mouth. "I'll give you a chance to live. Give me all the life vitality jades you have, now! And, if you give me enough jades every day, I'll let you go. If you fail by the end of any day, your life..."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your kind intentions, but I don't need that chance," Luo Zheng interrupted and smiled, as the chaotic energy within his body suddenly erupted and he closed in on Ernest.</p>

  <p>During his last few months in the Lower World, Luo Zheng had diligently and painstakingly trained without stopping.</p>

  <p>In addition to cultivating the Primal Chaos Technique and the Stellar Body, he had also found some books which had the Original Laws in them inside the fairy palace's library.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Original Laws were carved on the stone tablets, but his master had directly recorded numerous kinds of laws in huge books. By reading these books, one would be able to completely master them without a single omission. With Zheng's perfect affinity, and his cultivation speed enhanced by the old man's pill, his mastering speed was extremely fast. As soon as he had obtained these books, he had begun to swiftly learn the Original Laws.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in a short period of time, he managed to learn three layers of them. Other books in the library also had records of the rest of the laws.</p>

  <p>However, it was quite time-consuming for him to master them. He knew clearly that he couldn't have too much on his plate, so he had not spent too much time in learning the remaining laws.</p>

  <p>He had tried to use the chaotic energy to activate the Law Power before.</p>

  <p>By experience, he knew that his power would increase exponentially in this way.</p>

  <p>Once he broke through to the Life and Death Realm, he would have the strength to fight against ordinary Soul Sea Realm martial artists. During the training he had done before flowing into the Upper World, he had replaced his life vitality with chaotic energy and raised his cultivation base to the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm. It was no exaggeration to say that he had made a huge spurt of progress, so he wasn't afraid of those martial artists who had just reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>As the chaotic energy in his body surged, he used the Cloud-chasing Skill that he had learned from Brianna. Utilizing that, he moved towards Ernest at an unbelievable speed.</p>

  <p>Ernest was stunned. At that moment, he suddenly remembered that he had once suffered due to underestimating his opponent.</p>

  <p>Before flying into the Upper World, he had suffered a great loss in the Lower World. He had looked down on his opponent, and was severely wounded as a result. In fact, he had almost died. He was able to successfully ascend merely because of his fortuitous encounter after being heavily injured.</p>

  <p>From then on, he had repeatedly warned himself that no matter what happened, he should never underestimate his opponents. He promised that no matter who it was, he would treat his enemy seriously.</p>

  <p>But the guy in front of him was just a young man at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>The gap between the Life and Death Realm and the Soul Sea Realm was unimaginably huge. With merely the power of his domain, he would be able to suppress every single Life and Death Realm martial artist.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was closing in on him, he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p>

  <p>He, who had suffered once, instantly became vigilant and reflexively spread out his domain.</p>

  <p>"Myriad Ghosts Domain!"</p>

  <p>As he activated his Myriad Ghosts Domain, the surroundings immediately began to be filled with ghostly shadows. In just a few moments, his entire surroundings were blanketed in a grim atmosphere.</p>

  <p>When he was in the Lower World, Luo Zheng had relied on the world's will to transfer the attacks, so he was very afraid of Soul Sea Realm martial artists. However, he was no longer in there and wouldn't be able to transfer the attacks to fight now. Still, he had become much more powerful than before.</p>

  <p>"You know what, it's too late to activate the domain now." Luo Zheng shook his head. If Ernest had used the power of his domain from the very beginning of this fight, it would have taken a lot of effort for Luo Zheng to break it. But even then, he was sure that he would have defeated his opponent. Now, since they were only a short distance away, the domain didn't work at all.</p>

  <p>Before the ghostly shadows could form perfectly, Zheng's palm had already struck Ernest's chest.</p>

  <p>In this move, he had used the strength of four thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the forceful energy in his arm had also erupted, and a rich amount of the power of the Wind Law had also been brought up.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone saw Zheng's hand move at a speed that exceeded the limits of what could be seen with the naked eyes. They merely saw a flash of blue light, and then a muffled sound came.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Ernest's tall body fell from the top of the mine. Like a falling meteor, he directly smashed into a cave. At that very moment, the momentum was so high that the cave collapsed, followed by a loud rumbling sound.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>From the depths of the mine, the sound continuously emerged. Everyone knew that Ernest had been buried and smashed thousands of feet into the mine.</p>

  <p>Only after a long while did the rumbling sound fade away.</p>

  <p>The remaining six Soul Sea Realm martial artists were still looking down where their leader had fallen in shock.</p>

  <p>Their eyes were filled with astonishment, and they kept swallowing, trying to fight their fear.</p>

  <p>With a single slap from Luo Zheng, their leader had fallen into the depths of the mine. Without doubt, he must have died down there.</p>

  <p>They had chosen Ernest as their leader because his strength was the strongest amongst the seven of them. That was the only reason why they had agreed to band together and compete for the life vitality crystals of other martial artists. In this mining field, they weren't the only people who had done that. In fact, a considerable number of martial artists were too lazy to dig for themselves, so they collected life vitality crystals by robbery.</p>

  <p>This group of seven people was relatively small in number. Some of them had even combined their strength to form a group of dozens of members. They even monopolized a mine in this vein. All the martial artists who entered their mine would have to pay a certain amount of life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>When these seven people had first seen that Luo Zheng was only at the Life and Death Realm, they were confused. How could a Life and Death Realm martial artist come here? They couldn't figure out why.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't ponder over it too seriously. They weren't going to pay much attention to a mere Life and Death Realm martial artist. They did not even take Freya seriously, let alone Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now they finally understood that Zheng's cultivation and strength could not be underestimated. His strength was much higher than that of those who had just reached the Soul Sea Realm. Even Ernest had hardly been able to resist him.</p>

  <p id="top_14">Freya's mouth was slightly open as she thought about what had happened just now. She had an expression of disbelief on her face. No matter how imaginative she was, it was impossible for her to come up with a scenario where Luo Zheng was exactly his own backer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at his palm with a faint smile on his face, as if the intense scene in front of them didn't even happen. Then he asked, "I wonder if the Spiritual Force Sacred Place really does not care about us killing people for their goods. If so, that's great."</p>

  <p>At his words, the faces of all the martial artists changed drastically and turned a deathly shade of pale and white.</p>

  <p>"We have to leave! Now!"</p>

  <p>As Soul Sea Realm martial artists, they made their decisions very quickly. They knew that Luo Zheng was trying to threaten them, but if they didn't act tactfully, he would kill them without the slightest bit of hesitation. Therefore, no one dared to answer his question.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>In an instant, all of the martial artists had fled.</p>
