<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a blinding flash as the Supreme Lord's saber swept through the air and accurately hit that single grain of sand.</p>

  <p>The moment the steel tip of his saber hit the grain, he noticed a hairline crack appear on his crescent blade light.</p>

  <p>In the end, his crescent blade light couldn't even swat the tiny grain away. The tremendous force of his slash was wasted and merely continued passing through half of the universe to pierce through thousands of stars before totally dissipating.</p>

  <p>The tiny grain of sand merely floated on the spot as it slowly rotated in the air.</p>

  <p>The results greatly dismayed Supreme Lord Ranell. He was a mighty Supreme Lord yet he couldn't even cause any damage to this tiny grain of sand!</p>

  <p>He raised his saber to try again but another Supreme Lord stepped forward and indicated that it was now his turn to attack the sand grain.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords all took their turn trying to break this grain of sand one after another. They exhausted all of their abilities and used every kind of Law of Causality they knew but to no avail.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the Supreme Lords. Even Luo Zheng and Xun, who currently hid within the fairy palace, were equally shocked at the extreme resilience of the sand grain.</p>

  <p>This fairy palace had always been Zheng's final fort, a place where he could hide when things immediately went south for him— a sanctuary in times of desperation.</p>

  <p>He relied greatly on this fairy palace but even he did not expect that it would be able to block even a mighty Supreme Lord's attack.</p>

  <p>He was extremely nervous earlier but witnessing the Supreme Lords fail one after the other relieved him greatly. The strength of the palace wasn't something to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he had greatly underestimated his master and the origin of this fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He knew his master was someone who had surpassed the heavens and this fairy palace was something extraordinary but never to this extent!</p>

  <p>What exactly was the world above heavens like? And just how powerful was his master's cultivation base?</p>

  <p>It was something Luo Zheng couldn't really imagine.</p>

  <p>His thoughts then veered towards the man who had taken Yan away.</p>

  <p>Now that he thought about it, he realized that not even Xun would stand any chance of defeating that man. The young man's strength far surpassed that of a Supreme Lord which was the level Xun's true strength was at.</p>

  <p>Someone above heavens… was he the true god?</p>

  <p>The conclusion left a bitter taste in his mouth but he nonetheless found himself smiling. If that was really the case, then it seemed he had quite a long way to go if he wanted to see Yan again.</p>

  <p>Xun floated quietly beside Luo Zheng but the sparkle of excitement in her eyes was undeniable. She was equally shocked and awed by the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>She was ten times more knowledgeable than Luo Zheng but not even she could gauge the true power of the fairy palace. She didn't even think it was anything special at first. Now that she was witnessing its resilience firsthand, she finally understood that it was something way beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>Outside the fairy palace, more than twenty Supreme Lords had already used whatever method they could think of to make the tiny grain budge, but none of them were successful.</p>

  <p>It was truly laughable how they were just threatening Luo Zheng a few moments ago. They never thought they'd end up being the powerless ones in this situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hid in this minuscule sand grain but they could do nothing to him!</p>

  <p>Yao had the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand but silently dropped it while gazing at that tiny grain of sand.</p>

  <p>So many Supreme Lords had already tried their best but it had all been in vain. She knew the power she could unleash with the help of the Faith Energy was going to be stronger but she didn't think it would still be enough.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of resentment in Yao's eyes. Xun's unintentional exposure of her position should've ended things smoothly. Yao thought that this was going to be the perfect opportunity for her to finally kill her rival queen who remained as the final obstacle in her domination of the entire Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>She didn't think that things were going to be a bit more complicated due to the protection of this mysterious fairy palace.</p>

  <p>'If I let Luo Zheng go this time, he and Xun will rely on this fairy palace to become stronger…' she thought. Yao then found herself in a state of great crisis. She didn't fully know the origins of this fairy palace but she knew that it was probably something far beyond her imagination. It was most likely filled with great resources that could increase Zheng's strength in the future.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng managed to become a Supreme Lord, he'd surely help Xun recover her strength. When that happened, Yao was sure to be doomed.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't give up! I must break this space treasure today!" Yao brandished the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand and smashed it towards the grain of sand…</p>

  <p>A day had passed but the Supreme Lords could now only stand and watch as the grain of sand spun slowly in place.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny had made them come here but this powerful space treasure that was the fairy palace completely captured their interest.</p>

  <p>Some of them had truly exhausted all means necessary to break the grain with a few even using some very special Laws of Causality. In their desperation, one even used poison.</p>

  <p>The poison strategy greatly amused Luo Zheng. A Supreme Lord's poison was a thousand times stronger than regular ones but it still wasn't enough. This tiny grain of sand drove these Supreme Lords mad!</p>

  <p>Several more Supreme Lords arrived and their number was now close to thirty.</p>

  <p>They all came from different races and represented the different forces of the universe.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>There was a slight buzzing sound as another burst of light signaled the arrival of another Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The light slowly condensed into a figure of a man and the sight of his face changed the expressions on everyone's faces.</p>

  <p>Although the figure was of a man, this latecomer did not come from the human race but from the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>This race was peculiar and was a hybrid of many different races.</p>

  <p>Whether it was a human or some other member of another race, one would have to go through the pre-requisite blood exchange to become a true Celestial Position member. It wasn't a large group but every single member was powerful, especially their Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, the race was also well-known for being unreasonable. The arrival of a Celestial Position Supreme Lord meant that things here were about to get complicated soon enough.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Marcello! Did the Celestial Position race also come to have a finger in the pie?" Supreme Lord Ranell asked with a sneer.</p>
