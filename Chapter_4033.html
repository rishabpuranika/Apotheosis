<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had always regarded the Treasure Bottle Platform as a very important place for their race. It was heavily guarded by the Joy House.</p>

  <p>For the longest time, the members of the Nihility race had never even considered attacking the Treasure Bottle Platform.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to lead them inside.</p>

  <p id="top_11">They fought their way in and killed all of the members of the Joy House.</p>

  <p>The plan went too smoothly that it felt like a trap.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked around then sneered. "It has taken me some time before I managed to lure out and vanquish the ghosts of the Joy House. But now, it seems like they were just baits. Does it mean that this is some sort of bait as well? Or are you freely handing it over to me?"</p>

  <p>After saying this, the Grandmaster of Heaven faced towards the Eye Spirit and shook the pale yellow bottle in his hand.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, one of the Eye Spirit's eyes opened wide and fixed its stare at the bottle. It glared with such force that...</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's arm was completely chopped off by the eye's intense stare. The severed arm still held the bottle in its hand. Both had instantly disappeared and reappeared beside the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven! Your arm..." Phelps yelled in shock. He stared at it with a frown.</p>

  <p>Ewing, Sloan, and Larson exchanged nervous glances. They couldn't believe what just happened.</p>

  <p>However, they thought the Grandmaster of Heaven wouldn't have been so careless. Maybe he had a trick up his sleeve. Nevertheless, they were still a little worried when they saw his bloody arm.</p>

  <p>They needed not worry because at the next moment, the arm and the bottle that appeared beside the Eye Spirit suddenly exploded. They merely turned into a mass of colorful smoke.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven smiled and calmly took out a white silk cloth to cover his wound. Astonishingly, the broken arm had been recovered when he pulled the silk cloth off. The bottle was still in his hand.</p>

  <p>He continued to shake the bottle towards the Eye Spirit. "It was simply magic."</p>

  <p>All at once, each and every eyeball on the Eye Spirit's body blinked. They looked at the Grandmaster of Heaven with disgust and pure loathing.</p>

  <p>"There is no way I'd let you have the Divine Dao energy! You won't be able to get out of here alive!"</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>The huge cat under the Eye Spirit got up with its back arched. Its fur stood on its ends as it started to emit an extremely foul and repulsive aura. This was a resentment-level Treacherous Being. It was known to be exceptionally powerful among its kind.</p>

  <p>The revolting aura immediately began turning into visible black waves.</p>

  <p>Darby's golden bell was a powerful defensive treasure. However, the surface of the bell was instantly riddled with holes as the black waves washed over it. Under the pressure of the black waves, Stella was about to collapse.</p>

  <p>"Darby, take Stella away from here," the Grandmaster of Heaven ordered at once.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master! Right away!" Darby bowed obediently and asked, "But can I stay and fight here afterwards?"</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven merely gave him a cold look so he didn't say anything else.</p>

  <p>As soon as he put away the golden bell, a silver curtain appeared in his other hand. He wrapped himself and Stella with the silver curtain and quickly dashed towards the other side of the platform.</p>

  <p>He was the Grandmaster of Heaven's eldest disciple. Therefore, he clearly knew how and why his master had suddenly become so powerful.</p>

  <p>Whenever a battle involved Treacherous Beings, the Grandmaster of Heaven would no longer be human. He would transform into a Treacherous Being, or half human and half Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>There was a time when Darby also wanted to obtain such power. He thought it was a very convenient and useful ability.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he and Maynard Zhao had made so many requests for their master to teach them.</p>

  <p>After all, they often had to face Treacherous Beings whenever they traveled within the Three Purities Stage. It seemed reasonable that they learned how to use that power as well.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter whether the Treacherous Beings were strong or weak. They always had no other choice but to run away from them. It was even difficult for them to move a single step when faced with these monsters.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the Grandmaster of Heaven refused their requests right off the bat. In return, he gave each disciple a strange stone. The Light of Annihilation was contained within each of the stones. It could easily kill the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>All of his eight personal disciples had one.</p>

  <p>Even though the stone was only the size of a small bean, the Light of Annihilation contained inside it could effectively slay the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Stella, Sienna, and Samantha were the weakest among the disciples. But even they could kill the Treacherous Beings with the help of their stones.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After Darby and Stella gained enough distance, they noticed a lump of soil rising from the flat ground in front of them. It was like a tomb without a tablet.</p>

  <p>When Darby saw the bump, he instantly pulled the silver curtain and released Stella from it.</p>

  <p>Stella was the youngest disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Despite that, she was not easily scared. In fact, she was quite courageous. The lump of soil emitted a disgusting and foul aura. It was most likely that there were Treacherous Beings hiding underneath it.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>She promptly turned around and swiftly pulled the sword strapped on her waist. She maintained her stance and observed silently.</p>

  <p>The stone given by her master was embedded in her sword. In this way, she would be able to inflict serious damage to a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Stella wouldn't normally use this sword to defend against any other enemy.</p>

  <p>But whenever she encountered a Treacherous Being, the sword would always come in handy.</p>

  <p>Buzz! It started emitting a powerful energy.</p>

  <p>She raised her long sword then positioned it horizontally at the level of her head. The stone embedded on the hilt was emitting the Light of Annihilation. It began covering the edges of the sword.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a long stick appeared upon Darby's shoulder. His stone was embedded on the center of the stick. The Light of Annihilation emitted by the stone radiated towards both ends of the stick.</p>

  <p>The creatures under the bump seemed to have noticed the enemies outside.</p>

  <p>Before long, some monkeys came out one after another. At that point, Darby and Stella were able to identify them as hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Hostility-level Treacherous Beings were relatively weak. They could easily take them out if there were just a few of them. Unfortunately, they came in a large number this time.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! One by one the monkeys began to move.</p>

  <p>As the monkeys charged at them, Stella's eyes gleamed in anticipation. The sword radiance danced around her. The Light of Annihilation had swiftly and methodically cut into the bodies of monkeys. It effectively obliterated their shapes.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Darby's long stick released thousands of white stick shadows. It smashed the monkeys into pieces in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>With their outstanding expertise, they efficiently annihilated all of the monkeys that came from the lump of soil.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, nothing came out of the bump anymore.</p>

  <p>"There is no more monkey left!" Stella shouted to Darby.</p>

  <p>"Good job! Let's go!" Darby quickly responded.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At that very moment, they heard a violent roar coming from the Treasure Bottle Platform. It immediately caught their attention.</p>

  <p>As they turned around simultaneously, they saw that the Grandmaster of Heaven's body had expanded many times. Stella noticed a faint shadow on his arm. Sometimes, this shadow was not visible. But there were also times that it suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>"Darby! Look at Master's arm!" Stella yelled as she pointed at the Grandmaster of Heaven's gigantic body.</p>

  <p>Darby merely glanced at it with an impassive expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"That's none of our business, Stella. Let's keep moving!"</p>

  <p>After he spoke, he grabbed Stella's arm and dragged her forward. They needed to get out of here as soon as possible. Before long, another three bumps appeared in their path.</p>

  <p>Some monkeys jumped out of the bumps on either sides. Meanwhile, three black creatures emerged from the bump in the center. Their bodies were quite similar to those of humans. However, there were two pairs of bone blades where their hands and feet should be.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that they were from the Bone Blade race that supported the Element Spirit Civilization. They were quite strong.</p>

  <p>Stella narrowed her eyes slightly and the Light of Annihilation began to flow through her long sword once again. "Darby, you take care of the three members of the Bone Blade race. Meanwhile, I will eliminate the monkeys."</p>

  <p>Even though the three members of the Bone Blade race were strong, they were still no match for Darby.</p>

  <p>After so many years of patient cultivation, Darby was almost as strong as the Grandmaster of Heaven. Therefore, Stella had complete confidence in his abilities.</p>

  <p>But just as Stella finished speaking, the three members of the Bone Blade race had already charged towards them. They moved with such speed that they were only a few meters away front of them.</p>

  <p>"Stella, watch out!"</p>

  <p>Darby had obviously sensed something was wrong.</p>

  <p>He quickly pulled Stella back and an umbrella instantly appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The umbrella unfurled at once. It had an excellent defensive power.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it would be extremely difficult to destroy. It was one of Darby's most prized and powerful defensive treasures.</p>

  <p>Yet, Stella heard a loud slashing sound. The umbrella had been easily torn apart like it was just a piece of paper. This was the work of the three members of the Bone Blade race. Moreover, Darby's shoulder had also been severed off.</p>

  <p>Darby's blood splattered onto Stella's face. Her eyes full of shock and fear, she realized that these were not ordinary members of the Bone Blade race.</p>

  <p>The expressions in their eyes were exactly like that of her master when he went mad.</p>
