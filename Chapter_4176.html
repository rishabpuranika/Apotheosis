<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bromley, Mike, and those who were standing at the top of the divine land like Lorena and Harold, also saw the blurry figure in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man?"</p>

  <p>"Is he from our Ruin Graveyard?"</p>

  <p>"What does he want to do? Does he plan on facing that head alone? It's impossible."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of these people, Tianming's power was the strongest in the chaos.</p>

  <p>After all, there was no Other Shore Token that was stronger than one from the thirty-third stage.</p>

  <p>Lorena, Harper, and all the others recognized this as fact.</p>

  <p>And yet, even Tianming was unable to deal with the head, which had become fifty thousand times larger. Who else could possibly face it?</p>

  <p>However, there were powers other than those of Other Shore Tokens in the chaos. Take for example, the power that Zheng was using was the omniscient power that every Soul Sea Realm warrior had.</p>

  <p>The catch was, he could only use this power in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The head either didn't notice or completely ignored Zheng's small figure rushing towards it. Instead, it opened its large mouth to take a bite of the divine land.</p>

  <p>One bite was enough to swallow a third of the divine land. However, just then, the head abruptly stopped in its tracks. There seemed to be an invisible force between its upper and lower jaws, preventing it from closing its mouth. It suddenly couldn't bite anymore!</p>

  <p>"Give me some strength," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No problem," the ancestry-level bloodline responded.</p>

  <p>The blood mist in the sky flickered, as if blood-red lightning flashed within it.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out a hand and grabbed at the air. Then, he flew up and arched through the air. "Up!" he roared.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>To everyone's shock, the head was inching upwards, as though it was being dragged into the sky slowly.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Bromley, Mike, Lorena, Harold and Rachelle were all stunned to see this.</p>

  <p>That blurry figure might have had the courage to appear above the head, but never in their wildest dreams did they imagine that he would do such a thing.</p>

  <p>Yet, here was this mysterious figure, lifting the head up into the sky. Then, with incredible force, the blurry figure threw the head into oblivion.</p>

  <p>What did that mean?</p>

  <p>The head was roughly the same size as the divine land; could this mean that this mysterious figure could lift even the divine land?!</p>

  <p>"Is there such a powerhouse in the Source World?" Harold turned to ask Lorena.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had learned from Lorena that warriors at the eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm were extraordinary, and they would be treated well in the great forces. This knowledge had comforted Harold before.</p>

  <p>But now, as he watched these events unfold before him, his mind was melting. This figure must have been beyond the Other Shore Realm!</p>

  <p>"No! No one could do that," Lorena answered affirmatively.</p>

  <p>The corners of Harold's eyes twitched. 'Where did this figure come from?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the sun in the divine land, Harper's body trembled as he could barely contain his excitement.</p>

  <p>Others couldn't see who the person was because he was too far away, but Harper could see him clearly from the divine land's perspective.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng, it had to be!</p>

  <p>Although the appearance matched, Harper was still not sure.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng had asked him about the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. He was only a consummate True God, who hadn't even stepped onto the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But now, he had come so far!</p>

  <p>Harper came from the Source World, and he was naturally insightful.</p>

  <p>As an Other Shore Realm warrior, he had witnessed the strength of the Eternal Realm warriors, but which of them had strength like this?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A blood-red light shot out from the sky formed by the blood mist. Zheng was enveloped in the blood-red light, rendering him a figure of blood.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Covered in blood, Zheng extended the blood sword in his hand and rushed towards the head that he had just thrown. His blood-colored body flashed through the skies as if he had completely ignored all Space Laws.</p>

  <p>As he approached, the blood sword flashed ominously.</p>

  <p>Normally, the blood sword could only cause a wound four or five inches deep.</p>

  <p>For the head that had become fifty thousand times larger, the damage would've been ignorable.</p>

  <p>No one else could see clearly what was going on. Even Harper could only see a trace of blood-red light drilling into the head.</p>

  <p>Then, he heard a slight sound coming from the head.</p>

  <p>The sound was like a charcoal pencil scratching paper, or like a cool wind whistling through a bamboo forest.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the head began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>It dissolved into hundreds of millions of shards, like a massive meteor shower, raining towards the ground.</p>

  <p>After all the pieces disappeared, a silence fell over the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Everyone was speechless.</p>

  <p>Even now, the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard had no idea what had really happened.</p>

  <p>The only thing that gave them some semblance of solace was that a human being had killed the massive head.</p>

  <p>After cutting off the head, Zheng scanned his surroundings till his eyes fell on Lorena, who was standing at the top of the divine land.</p>

  <p>In a flash of blood-red light, Zheng suddenly appeared in front of Lorena.</p>

  <p>When Lorena, Rosie and Harold saw the figure of blood, they froze in shock. Harold, however, stepped in front of Lorena to protect her, even though he knew that this was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Staring at the figure of blood before her, Lorena suddenly had a sense of familiarity. She could not help but call out, "Zheng, is that you?"</p>

  <p>Rosie shot a concerned glance at her sister, feeling a little uneasy. Was she so stressed that she had begun to hallucinate? What if she annoyed the figure of blood?</p>

  <p>"Zheng," Harold called cautiously.</p>

  <p>The blood-red light on Zheng's body began to fade, revealing his true appearance.</p>

  <p>This was his incarnation, so he didn't have any special power. He was like a grass or a stone in the primitive land. He was insignificant.</p>

  <p>Rosie turned around and glared at Harold this time. What was wrong with him?</p>

  <p>But then, she suddenly sensed that something was wrong. As she turned to the figure before them, her body froze.</p>

  <p>Standing nearby, Rachelle also felt as if she had been struck by lightning.</p>

  <p>When she was reborn, she had grown up to perform excellently.</p>

  <p>But deep in her heart, she never stopped thinking about Zheng.</p>

  <p>She knew that her sister went to Zheng to beg him to spare her, and that Zheng had gone to the distant Source World in order to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>All this time, she was hoping that if Zheng returned one day, she would've surpassed him in power.</p>

  <p>Of course, she had never told anyone about this.</p>

  <p>When all the resources of the Ruin Graveyard were available and the strength of the consummate True Gods in the divine land had advanced by leaps and bounds, she felt hopeful.</p>

  <p>Even Tianming had managed to reach the thirty-third stage, and he was said to be the strongest warrior in the Source World.</p>

  <p>This whole time, she believed that as long as she mastered the Truth of Godly Way, it was possible for her to catch up with Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now that she looked at Zheng, she suddenly felt small and stupid. Her imagined opponent was far beyond her reach.</p>
