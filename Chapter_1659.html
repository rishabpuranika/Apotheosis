<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1659 Ulysses </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Saya race's grand sacred place, a giant totem was erected.</p>

  <p>An Illusion Space was present at the bottom of this massive totem. The picture appearing from the Illusion Space manifested in front of the totem.</p>

  <p>At this moment, hundreds of thousands of Saya members sat around the totem, gazing at the giant picture in front of them.</p>

  <p>The Saya race could only be considered a second-class race in the universe. Only one Supreme Lord had appeared in the race and there had never been a True God. The entire Saya race relied on the Supreme Lord, and struggled to support themselves in becoming one of the first-class races.</p>

  <p>However, compared to the first-class races such as the human race, the Demon Night race and the ogres, the Saya race appeared to be very weak.</p>

  <p>But today, the most outstanding talent of their race had ascended the peak of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>It was a rare opportunity for the Saya race to rise in the universe. This talent was like a precious seed that would eventually grow into a giant tree. Sooner or later, he would become the new protector of the race. He might even become the first True God of the race.</p>

  <p>"Ulysses' first opponent is a human woman!"</p>

  <p>"He's pretty lucky that he hasn't run into any of those Godly Geniuses."</p>

  <p>"This woman doesn't seem to have any fighting spirit. Hah! Ulysses is bound to win the battle."</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Saya members began to discuss it among themselves, their words like a chant. It was akin to the buzz of bees. The atmosphere around the giant totem thrived.</p>

  <p>Under this massive totem, the chief of Saya race raised the pike in his hand and held it parallel, a gesture for the others to keep quiet.</p>

  <p>The Saya members fell silent as the chief howled, "Our ancestors will bless the Saya race!</p>

  <p>They will bless Ulysses!</p>

  <p>Their souls will never die!"</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The Saya members echoed at the same time.</p>

  <p>The giant totem was the Ancestral Totem of the Saya race. Upon the death of the warriors of the Saya race, their flesh would be burnt away, but their souls would remain forever.</p>

  <p>The Saya members had poured the souls of their ancestors into the Ancestral Totem. The totem was unable to protect the souls from being destroyed, but with the infusion of countless ancestral souls, it contained the will of many ancestors.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At the same time, on the giant board, the two totems behind Ulysses' back emitted faint lights.</p>

  <p>Holding the black pike in his hand, Ulysses had a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Father, you're too nervous. You have summoned the ancestral power in the first battle for me, but I don't actually need it."</p>

  <p>When the ancestral power was summoned, all totems of the Saya warriors were able to transmit the strong power.</p>

  <p>However, the ancestral power was not only owned by Ulysses himself, but also by the other warriors of the Saya race.</p>

  <p>It was only during the wars that the Saya warriors called on the ancestral power. But now, for the sake of Ulysses alone, the ancestral power had been summoned. It was in some ways a waste, because Ulysses alone was battling it out while the ancestral power was supposed to be directed toward all Saya warriors. It also meant that the Saya race obviously attached great importance to him.</p>

  <p>"If that's how it has to be, then I must show my immense prowess in the first battle!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>The black pike swung in Ulysses' hand. He smiled at the delicate human woman apologetically before darting toward her like an explosion.</p>

  <p>The area on the board was vast.</p>

  <p>The giant hand had landed the white stone in the middle of the board, which was also called the "sun." Therefore, Ulysses was standing in the middle.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, was resting on one of the "stars." A distance of tens of thousands of feet extended between her and Ulysses.</p>

  <p>However, at Ulysses' sudden move, the distance between them was reduced to a mere few hundred feet.</p>

  <p>A lean afterimage dragged its way, and after a certain point, it completely disappeared. When Ulysses' figure reappeared, Mu Ning found that he was only ten feet away from her.</p>

  <p>The black pike in his hand was also ten feet long.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The pike was suddenly shoved toward her.</p>

  <p>However, what Mu Ning saw was a giant black python. The scales on the python's body shone with black luster. Circling in the air, it opened its large mouth to devour her.</p>

  <p>The ancestors of the Saya race worshipped the four sacred beasts� Black Luster Python, Illusory Demon Porcupine, Magic Cyan Condor, and Ever-sleeping Oryx.</p>

  <p>Although the outsiders did not know enough about the four sacred beasts, the beasts held a great position within the Saya race.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was somewhat impetuous to begin with.</p>

  <p>Fighting others was something she had detested from the start.</p>

  <p>When she saw the giant python open its mouth wide and reveal its dense fangs, panic involuntarily surfaced on her face. With a single thought, the seven flying swords came spiraling over.</p>

  <p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>

  <p>The seven flying swords instantly formed into a defensive sword array, acting as a blockage in front of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>However, this simple sword array was unable to stop Ulysses' pike.</p>

  <p>A pike's shape was similar to a spear, but the difference was that a spear came with a hard pole, while a pike's body was thinner and softer.</p>

  <p>Seeing this somewhat clumsy sword array, Ulysses chuckled faintly.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had thought that he would use about thirty percent of his strength to defeat this woman, but he now realized that he had overestimated her. He did not know on what basis this human girl was able to make the top three hundred. In his eyes, she was even weaker than some of the core disciples of a random tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>This battle was too easy for him.</p>

  <p>The black pike in his hand vibrated, and the black python it formed coiled around itself. It charged left and right, sensing the flaws in the sword array and instantly piercing through it to head straight for Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>Now that her sword array was unable to stop its opponent, Margaret's expression grew even more panicky.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, a purple ray of light spread out from under her feet. She circulated her body movement skill and increased her speed by more than ten times as she quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>Standing atop the stone, Luo Zheng stared at the scene before him, rather speechless himself.</p>

  <p>He had never seen her actual strength before, though she had entered the final stage of the Illusion Battlefield. Now that she was in a face-off against a member of the Saya race, she could only flee. He could not understand what Mu Ning had relied on to earn so many Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>It was not just Luo Zheng who had such thoughts.</p>

  <p>As the two of them fought, the other warriors on the board and the rest watching the fight from around the Illusion Spaces were bewildered.</p>

  <p>How did this woman get to this stage?</p>

  <p>The women in the Purple Power World were the most puzzled.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning came from the Purple Power World, and right now, she represented them.</p>

  <p>Although she had a lot of shortcomings, her talent was undoubtedly indescribable. She had the first-rank Purple Power Body and could unleash a strong battle power even though she was only at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"What happened to Mu Ning?"</p>

  <p>"She seems rather afraid of her opponent."</p>

  <p>"If this goes on, she will lose in three moves!"</p>

  <p>The women were anxious. In the end, they cast their gazes toward the old woman behind them, Elder Apeiron.</p>

  <p>When Elder Apeiron saw this scene, she shook her head. However, no trace of worry marred her features. Instead, she said, "She's acting impulsively. Perhaps she needs some time to get used to it."</p>

  <p>'The woman's sword array is nothing good, but her escape speed is first-rate!'</p>

  <p>Ulysses thought. His pike pushed and prodded, easily breaking the sword array, but Mu Ning had already retreated tens of thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Ulysses sneered. From one of the totems behind his back, a brown halo of light spread out.</p>

  <p>"Aroo!"</p>

  <p>A loud and clear condor cry sounded.</p>

  <p>Activating the ancestral power, he now had the speed of the Magic Cyan Condor.</p>

  <p>His two hands spread out, transforming into a condor's posture. He formed illusions in the air and drew closer to Mu Ning. The black pike once again closed in. At the same time, he had a serene expression on his face. "With this level of strength, I think it's best for you to humbly admit defeat."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, who had retreated tens of thousands of feet, looked up at the condor that was charging at her. A grave expression entered her clear eyes.</p>

  <p>Earlier, she had not been mentally prepared.</p>

  <p>Her only goal in the Illusion Battlefield had been to meet Luo Zheng. Now that she had achieved that, she no longer wanted to fight anyone.</p>

  <p>But now, not matter how much she wanted to back down, the person before her was still going to defeat her, or even kill her.</p>

  <p>It was useless to blindly give in. Moreover, at this moment, she remembered her master's instructions. It was not important that she got a rank; she just wanted to do her best.</p>

  <p>She could not get eliminated in the first round itself.</p>

  <p>As she thought of this, Margaret's pupils widened. The seven flying swords turned around at the same time and shot into the sky, forming a surging purple river.</p>
