<br/><br/>

  

  <p>A high cultivation level was needed to meet the head of the Origin Mountain. This standard was almost met by the golden-haired Ear Mouse but, it turned out, it still was not enough.</p>

  <p>A guard stepped forward and asked, "Why do you need to meet our master?</p>

  <p>If you have something to say, I can just deliver the message for you."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, the golden-haired Ear Mouse tossed a space ring.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>The space ring hit the ground and emitted the aura of divine crystals. Then, one by one, glittering and translucent divine crystals flowed out of it like water.</p>

  <p>"Here are fifteen million divine crystals!" With a flip of its claw, the golden-haired Ear Mouse revealed a small sheet with an Eight Diagrams pattern.</p>

  <p>"This is an Other Shore Key," it announced.</p>

  <p>The golden-haired Ear Mouse was one of the important leaders in the Mice League. It was tasked by the top managers of the Mice League to send fifteen million divine crystals and an Other Shore Key to the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>The golden-haired Ear Mouse did not initially agree, but it could not subvert the orders of the Mice League. For it, fifteen million divine crystals were too much, even if the Ear Mice were usually capable of earning money fast.</p>

  <p>The guards stared at the overflow of divine crystals. They had never seen so many in real life before. "I'll go inform the elders!" one of them announced.</p>

  <p>The guard transformed into a light and flew into the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the head did not show up. Instead, Winchell, Dorothy and Felicity came.</p>

  <p>'Impressive, ' Dorothy thought to herself. 'The Ear Mice have lived up to their reputation. They can indeed gather divine crystals quickly.' She stared at the divine crystals with joy and longing.</p>

  <p>Felicity and Winchell already knew this would happen. Dorothy had informed them the previous night.</p>

  <p>Face to face with the golden-haired Ear Mouse, Winchell exclaimed, "What a rare visitor! I didn't expect you'd be here!"</p>

  <p>The golden-haired Ear Mouse was quite well known, although not any stronger than Winchell. Of course, Winchell made sure to receive it hospitably.</p>

  <p>"I'm only here for one reason. I want to meet that person," the golden-haired Ear Mouse asserted.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were all greedy for money and were good at making money.</p>

  <p>They wanted to sell the significant information to the other races in the Source World that the man who could rescue those trapped in the whirlpools was in the Origin Mountain. By doing this, they could easily earn the fifteen million divine crystals back.</p>

  <p>Dorothy frowned and looked at Winchell. "Uncle, please don't agree," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>Winchell, of course, knew better. He shook his head and curtly said, "We can't do that. He's too important. The divine crystals you give us are enough. We will help you rescue that Ear Mouse trapped in the whirlpool."</p>

  <p>The golden-haired Ear Mouse frowned. Although the Mice League asked it not to make trouble, it couldn't just give them the divine crystals that way.</p>

  <p>"A deal is a deal. How do you expect me to feel at ease without meeting that man?"</p>

  <p>Winchell smiled. "We'd rather cancel the deal than have you meet him."</p>

  <p>Seeing Winchell's determination, the golden-haired Ear Mouse no longer insisted. It needed the Origin Mountain's help, after all. In the end, it tossed the Other Shore Key to Winchell. "I hope that you won't let us down," it warned before it left.</p>

  <p>As soon as it was gone, Dorothy picked up all the divine crystals and put them in the space ring. Then she took the Other Shore Key from Winchell.</p>

  <p>"You are good at doing business." Winchell snickered after leaving the transmission array.</p>

  <p>There were fifteen million divine crystals in the space ring. It was a colossal sum even to the people of the Origin Mountain. Dorothy and Zheng made a trip to the Sea of Truth and earned it effortlessly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we got lucky. Maybe the Ear Mouse trapped in the whirlpool is the son of their head. They are usually stingy. They wouldn't just pay such a large sum," Dorothy said with a smile.</p>

  <p>It wasn't every day that they encountered anything like that in the Sea of Truth. Dorothy and Zheng had then crossed the fourth line. Soon, they'd reach the sixth one.</p>

  <p>Winchell could finally confirm his guess from this deal.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is smart. Without our backing, I'm afraid he couldn't get so many divine crystals," Winchell said flatly.</p>

  <p>It was risky for Zheng to expose his real strength. Given his current strength, he couldn't make a big deal with the Mice League. However, it was a smart move to ask the Origin Mountain to receive such a large sum of divine crystals on his behalf. In this way, he could also keep his real strength a secret.</p>

  <p>Dorothy dismissed her uncle's mumbles. "I'll bring the divine crystals to Zheng," she interrupted. Then she transformed into a beam of light and went straight to the transmission array down the mountain.</p>

  <p>Felicity gazed at her distant figure and smiled. "We act as a go-between, but we get nothing in return. Dorothy doesn't care about it at all," she remarked.</p>

  <p>In the Truth Library of the Dragon City, Manuals on truth theurgies were neatly arranged in rows on the shelves.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the shelves in front of him. There must have been ten thousand manuals in there. Zheng's excitement couldn't be concealed.</p>

  <p>"Are these the truth theurgies of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Monica nodded. "The Oneness Sky Palace is one of the orthodox forces of the human race. It has earned a very rich history and has collected countless manuals. The manuals on the first floor don't require the compatibility with the Truth of Godly Way. You can borrow whichever you like, but you have to return them in a year."</p>

  <p>"I'm free to borrow all of these books?" Zheng confirmed with a hint of shock in his voice.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy had said, the competition in the Dragon City was fierce and cruel, but the Oneness Sky Palace had made a great deal of effort in many aspects. The Flag Masters and their subordinates in the Dragon City could learn truth theurgies, even if they were not considered the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"As you please," Monica confirmed with a faint smile. "There are many truth theurgies you could choose from. Come with me. I'll show you the second floor."</p>

  <p>Together, they went to the second floor where over ten thousand manuals on truth swordsmanship welcomed Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The manuals on this floor are usually provided to the Flag Masters. You can rent any of them at eight thousand divine crystals," Monica explained.</p>

  <p>"It's expensive, so be careful about choosing," Monica added. "If you don't have money, I can lend you some."</p>

  <p>"Lend me eight thousand divine crystals?" Zheng confirmed. When Monica nodded, he shook his head and refused politely. He could anyway afford it himself if he found it worth it.</p>

  <p>He glanced ahead and noticed a staircase leading upwards. "Does the third floor provide manuals on truth swordsmanship as well?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Monica looked up and her face turned grim. "Yes, but no ordinary man can afford the manuals there."</p>
