<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he entered the divine land, Bromley had swiftly removed his carapace armor off his body, and sported a classic green robe. This robe was his signature look, something that he wore very often in the past.</p>

  <p>Bromley was always regarded as handsome, most especially when he was young. Now that he had improved his cultivation base greatly, he was even more attractive. The strong aura carried him with elegance everywhere he went.</p>

  <p>Even Mike and Holy Jay were hardly able to recognize him at first glance, not to mention Hallet and Augustus.</p>

  <p>"He looks so familiar... Who might this be?" Augustus wondered as his eyes grew wide.</p>

  <p>"It's Master," Hallet responded.</p>

  <p>Though he was one hundred percent sure that it was Bromley, neither of them dared to approach him.</p>

  <p>The strongest warriors they had ever met in their lives were Timotheus and Emily. They had great energies and cultivation bases, making it so intimidating to merely look at them.</p>

  <p>But Bromley's aura was even stronger than that of them.</p>

  <p>Everyone was aware that the limit of cultivation in the divine land was the consummation of True God Realm. It was extremely difficult to become a Holy Being, much more to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>So far, there hadn't been any Holy Being who had broken through.</p>

  <p>Bromley's cultivation base had improved so much that he was much more powerful than the Holy Beings of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Bromley found himself landing on the Floating Island and gazed at his two disciples. He smiled gently as he acknowledged them,</p>

  <p>"Hallet, Augustus."</p>

  <p>The two looked at each other in relief, finally sure that this powerful man was indeed, their master.</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>In his excitement, Augustus rushed towards Bromley and fell to his knees.</p>

  <p>Hallet, on the other hand, tried to keep his calm. He walked solemnly towards his master and knelt down right beside Augustus.</p>

  <p>"It is Holy Bromley!"</p>

  <p>"It is! It is indeed Bromley!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that his training has done him well! He looks so powerful!"</p>

  <p>People were murmuring, right as Bromley's identity was confirmed. All were full of shock and excitement.</p>

  <p>"Rise," Bromley said with a smile, holding out his hand towards Hallet and Augustus to help them up.</p>

  <p>"Master, we have missed you. We've fulfilled all the tasks you assigned to us..."</p>

  <p>Augustus stood up, talking with passion to his master.</p>

  <p>"Do us a favor and please stop speaking," Hallet blurted out. He was always fed up with Augustus' verbose expressions.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him in years!" Augustus said, "Just let me have my moment!" His face was flustered and annoyed.</p>

  <p>These two bickering before him was not a surprise to Bromley. "It doesn't matter," he said with a smile. "Augustus is always a chatterbox. I don't mind."</p>

  <p>Bromley took the time to take a look at the crowd. He caught a glance from Estelle, who stood out among most.</p>

  <p>Estelle's radiant eyes were filled with all sorts of emotions: love, happiness, confusion, and even resentment. It seemed like everything she had to say was said through her eyes.</p>

  <p>When the two's eyes finally met, Estelle turned around and walked swiftly away from the crowd.</p>

  <p>Seeing her walk away, Bromley jerked forward and followed behind her.</p>

  <p>He gripped her wrist and tried to pull her in for a hug, but just as his fingertips touched her, she spun around with a scepter in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As this scepter trembled with power, it seemed as if a portion of the divine land's power was being used by Estelle alone.</p>

  <p>"Silence!"</p>

  <p>Before, when Estelle launched the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, her target was the entirety of the divine land. This was different, because now, her target was only Bromley. The crowds flocked and gasped at the sight of this. Who knew what was going to happen?</p>

  <p>Though Bromley proved to be extraordinarily strong, all the power within him was paralyzed by the Scepter of Gods' Silence!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>In one swift movement, Estelle swung the scepter and hit Bromley right in the chest.</p>

  <p>Her figure suddenly altered and began to look faded to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Because she was continuously hitting Bromley so quickly, no one could even see her. Each strike she made was fatal.</p>

  <p>"Hallet... She just... Look..." Augustus was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>"Don't meddle," Hallet replied. He knew Bromley could defend himself.</p>

  <p>The two knew that Bromley's cultivation base was a lot more than anyone could imagine. This meant that no matter what Estelle did, she could not injure him easily.</p>

  <p>However, Estelle had used all her strength. Even though Hallet seemed calm, hearing the sound of Estelle's hits made his eyes tremble.</p>

  <p>What if his master was hurt? Or worse, what if he had died?</p>

  <p>On another note, Mike and Holy Jay could not stand to watch Estelle do such horrible things. They knew that even if Bromley had hurt Estelle before, they couldn't let her kill him. That was not the way to get revenge.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Mike declared.</p>

  <p>However, as if she heard nothing, Estelle kept charging towards Bromley with the hope to kill him.</p>

  <p>But before Mike and Holy Jay could intercede, Bromley, who was beaten to the ground, looked at them with piercing eyes. He winked at them, and then his lip curled up into a small yet noticeable smile.</p>

  <p>Both of them were stunned. "Did you just see that?" Mike turned to Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Bromley was playing defenseless. If anyone had been hit by Estelle in the same way, they would have died. But Bromley was stronger than what he was showing everyone, and he knew it all along.</p>

  <p>He took every hit and every blow that came his way. Even when the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence had gone, he refused to fight back.</p>

  <p>It was not until Estelle exhausted herself that Bromley approached her and opened his arms.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, she threw herself into his embrace and began to sob endlessly.</p>

  <p>Bromley thought it was inappropriate to comfort Estelle before the crowds of people, so he turned towards the crowd. "We need to go," he said.</p>

  <p>He lifted a hand and gently moved away Estelle alongside him.</p>

  <p>"Master is so powerful! Look at that! She beat him up for so long and it's like nothing happened!" Augustus exalted proudly. He figured this was something he could brag about for a very long time, especially because he'd seen it happen.</p>

  <p>Four hours had passed and Bromley, together with Estelle, had returned safely to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The travel allowed Estelle to regain her composure and elegance, so as they arrived, she had only a wide smile across her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>Not long after the Holy Beings returned, Timotheus immediately rushed over to ask Ramzi about the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>The future of the divine land had to be discussed in great detail. They had to come to a decision that everyone was on board with.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had successfully merged with the Other Shore Token, the Green Jade Spirit successfully remained in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian eventually became the Green Jade Spirit's disciple, and Luo Zheng specially created a space for them. Only Luo Nian and the Green Jade Spirit could enter that place, so that no one could disturb them.</p>

  <p>After coming out of the inner world, Qiu Yinhe waited at the courtyard for what seemed like forever.</p>

  <p>Tension and worry filled Qiu Yinhe and the others when Luo Zheng was trapped on the Other Shore, and they could only wait for his return.</p>

  <p>"I apologize for causing so much worry while I remained on the Other Shore," Luo Zheng said solemnly to Qiu Yinhe, cupping his hands towards him.</p>

  <p>His decision to enter the Dark Region with Dorothy had been made hastily.</p>

  <p>He hadn't discussed it with anyone, so it caused much anxiousness among the group.</p>

  <p>In fact, Qiu Yinhe had heard about the situation from Flamine. He spoke,</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore is full of risks and dangers. I can't believe you entered the Dark Region and got out, but I am glad that you are safe. You are one lucky bastard!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for praising me," Luo Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe rolled his eyes at Luo Zheng. "I am not praising you. Not at all," he spoke with a sudden seriousness. "You are indeed, lucky. If not, you would be dead. Once you enter the Desire World, please talk to us before making any decisions. After all, we are quite experienced with things like these."</p>

  <p>"I'll make sure to keep that in mind," responded Luo Zheng. He knew that Qiu Yinhe was right, and that he should probably not cause too much trouble anymore.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, there is something else I wanted to talk to you about," Qiu Yinhe uttered, bringing back his serious expression.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"A man named Leopold is looking for you," replied Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>If one was only an Other Shore Realm warrior, it was impossible for them to come into contact with someone like Qiu Yinhe when they arrived at the Taiyi Heaven Palace. However, this time, Leopold came with some other people.</p>
