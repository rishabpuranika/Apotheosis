  <p>
</p>

  <p>Elder Ge also hesitated at the moment. Evan's case was really special. He was indeed registered on the list of eligible disciples to participate in this year's Competition, but he had been practicing in his secret chamber and had showed up only at the end of the competition.</p>

  <p>"Just allow him to fight! There's nothing special about it! Isn't it just one more match?" one disciple bellowed.</p>

  <p>"We want to see it! Evan is also Cloud Sect's disciple. Why can't he attend the All Peaks Competition?" one more disciple bellowed, rather unwilling to lose such a good opportunity to watch another wonderful match.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Seconded! Why can't he be allowed? It doesn't make any difference to have one more match!" another disciple added loudly.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, several disciples began to kick up a fuss about it.</p>

  <p>From their points of view, if they could watch one more match, especially the one between Evan Li and  Zheng Luo, it would have been a great bonus for them! After all, they had each spent a point on the All Peaks Competition, and although Evan really looked like an idiot, it could not be denied that he was really powerful.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a hundred thousand disciples of Cloud Sect got thrilled and began to chant, spontaneously and repeatedly, "One more fight!".</p>

  <p>Looking down at the enthusiastic audiences, Elder Ge gradually wavered, but there were still some thoughts in his mind that held him back. Of course, Zheng had already created so many miracles. But since he and Evan were not at all at the same level of strength, Zheng had no chance of winning this competition, which meant it would not be a fair competition. In fact, he had half a belief that Evan was trying to bully Zheng.</p>

  <p>While seeing so many people were supporting him, Evan stared at Zheng arrogantly, as if he were looking at a little weak sheep. He impatiently said again, "Elder Ge, look at that! Everyone is waiting for this fight. I think you should make the decision as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>Just then, things took a dramatic turn!</p>

  <p>Yan, who had been standing outside the battle ring, suddenly walked inside and yelled furiously, "Evan Li!"</p>

  <p>When Evan heard his name called out, his eyebrows narrowed. He had heard this voice before. Suddenly, he remembered exactly who would make such a voice and his face changed abruptly. A bitter expression appeared on his face. He asked in a trembling voice, "You, you are…"</p>

  <p>"You dare call me directly by my name and defile it with your vile tongue?" Yan cut in immediately, walking two steps closer to him and staring at him with her clear and beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>'Well," Evan tried to reply with an awkward look on his face. He shook his head immediately after thinking about it for a second. "No. I don't dare to do that!"</p>

  <p>Yan was wearing a veil. But the others could see that she had raised her eyebrows. Meanwhile, she asked proudly with a smile in her eyes, "Then what is it that you call me?"</p>

  <p>"Umm... I..." Evan replied hesitantly, even more embarrassed. "In front of so many people, I would rather not say it out since it would be…" It looked like Yan had caught on to his Achilles' heel. He no longer seemed confident and proud.</p>

  <p>"Really? Did you forget your vows?" Yan reminded him coldly.</p>

  <p>Evan was now full of deep regrets inside. He thought to himself bitterly,</p>

  <p>'Earlier, as soon as I walked out of my secret chamber, I was surprised to hear that a super genius from Cloud Sect has emerged at the All Peaks Competition. I decided to rush to the site and check him out. I wanted to see who this genius was and to have a go at him. When I arrived here, Patrick has already been defeated. This seemingly genius disciple whose strength is only at the second grade of the nature level has managed to defeat Patrick. I was really interested in fighting with him. It would have been so great. Never have I ever expected to meet Yan in person here.</p>

  <p>Isn't she supposed to be locked up in Hell Mountain right now? If I had known she was here, I wouldn't have come here today. Honestly, I am really not interested in All Peaks Competition's reward, and even if I defeated Zheng with my current strength, I guess the head of Cloud Sect wouldn't give me any reward!'</p>

  <p>At the same time, when hearing Yan mention his vows, Evan suddenly became dejected, like an eggplant that had experienced cold frost, and finally dropped his head, saying reluctantly in a low voice, "My queen!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's my good boy!" Yan remarked, laughing out with great satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Seeing such a scene, Zheng found him speechless. What had just happened? And how had it happened? When did his sister become a queen? Why would he call Yan his queen? And as soon as Yan had asked him to call her that, Evan had obeyed. How come he, with his level of strength was so obedient to Yan's orders?</p>

  <p>The disciples who were watching the scene were also completely stunned on hearing it.</p>

  <p>Did Evan just call the veiled woman his queen?</p>

  <p>He was acting like an idiot, but he was probably the strongest disciple of the Cloud Sect right now. How come he called the woman his queen?</p>

  <p>She was probably below him in strength. Who was this masked woman on earth? Wasn't she said to be Zheng's girl?</p>

  <p>Soon, all sorts of guesses about the woman's identity spread over among the audience. Some said she was Kenneth's daughter, while some said she was Yan. Anyway, almost all sorts of speculations were thrown about.</p>

  <p>"Do you have to fight with Zheng?" Yan asked one more question.</p>

  <p>Evan was at a loss since he didn't know how to answer her question.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he was eager to fight with Zheng and beat him up, but now, Yan had showed up unexpectedly and had made him call her queen in public, he was really not in the mood anymore.</p>

  <p>When she could not hear any reply from him, Yan proposed slowly, "If you really want to defeat Zheng and prove your strength, it is still feasible.</p>

  <p>Now that you are at the sixth grade of Illuminating Soul Realm, the competition between you and Zheng will be quite unfair. Even if you win, you will still be accused of bullying him, and you will not have much fun. Why don't you just compete against him in swordplay? I mean, both of you don't use your life vitality, making it a pure swordplay competition."</p>

  <p>When hearing Yan's proposal, Elder Ge's eyes lit up and widened in joy.</p>

  <p>Immediately, he seconded the idea briskly, "That's an excellent proposal.</p>

  <p>Evan, you are also good at swordplay. It would be fair for you two to compete with each other in pure swordplay."</p>

  <p>In fact, Elder Ge had witnessed Zheng's basic swordplay. As someone whose strength was not top among the elders, he still had a decent ranking and knew a thing or two. Thus, it was easy for him to know that Zheng's swordplay was really formidable. Therefore, he supported Yan's proposal. Apparently, he was also trying to set up a trap for Evan.</p>

  <p>Patrick, standing next to Elder Ge, also had a secret smile inside. He had competed against Zheng, so he obviously knew what was going on. 'This time, I believe that Evan definitely will fall into a well-set trap as he has never had the chance to figure out the real strength of Zheng's swordplay before. It's true that Evan can beat Zheng if they use their real strength to compete. However, in terms of pure swordplay? Hahaha…Evan, you are staring complete failure in the face, ' he thought happily and stealthily.</p>

  <p>"Compete in pure swordplay?" Evan replied carelessly, rubbing his nose.</p>

  <p>"I, Evan, have never been afraid of anyone in pure swordplay! All right!</p>

  <p>This final match will be a competition of our swordsmanship skills only!"</p>

  <p>Previously, as Yan had seen Zheng condense his sword spirit, she speculated that Zheng's attainments in swordsmanship were certainly not low, but she had not seen the formidable powers that lay behind that talent. The reason she had put forward such a proposal was that she simply didn't want to see Evan defeat Zheng with a dominating advantage and strength in the competition.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was that she had inadvertently set up a trap for Evan, just as what she had done years ago to defeat and tease him.</p>
