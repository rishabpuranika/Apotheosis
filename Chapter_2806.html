  <p>
</p>

  <p>But looking into the girls' eyes, he had a feeling that it wouldn't be easy to obtain the True Demon Body!</p>

  <p>That was the reason why he didn't rush out immediately.</p>

  <p>"Stop there!"</p>

  <p>As the woman floated in the air, brown energy emerged from her body, turning into a huge net, which was tens of thousands of feet in size, and it devoured the path in front of Nicholas and the others.</p>

  <p>Nicholas tore the net apart easily by twisting his arms slightly.</p>

  <p>As soon as the huge net was ripped apart by Nicholas, Clark and Murphy quickly scampered through the hole in the net.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Following them were Zeke, Jeremiah and the other Holy Beings in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>"The True Demon Body! It belongs to me!"</p>

  <p>Clark shouted triumphantly as he lunged at the girl on the left side.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he touched the girl's body, he let out a painful scream!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his body was consumed by a flame.</p>

  <p>Most of the people present could not make sense of the scene unfolding before them. After all, Clark was able to turn his body into a flame while he used the Elementary Fire Divine Dao. Moreover, as the top figure of the Elementary Fire Divine Dao, who else could be more proficient at controlling flames than him?</p>

  <p>However, nobody noticed that Murphy, who was standing the closest to Clark, looked as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>He dodged and quickly distanced himself from the girls.</p>

  <p>'Damn it!'</p>

  <p>Murphy cursed inwardly.</p>

  <p>He had seen everything clearly. Clark had not used the Elementary Fire Divine Dao. He had been swallowed up by the flame!</p>

  <p>The Holy Being's body had been burned to ashes in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>After Clark was burnt completely, the red flame finally disappeared!</p>

  <p>"Clark! Did he get burnt to death?"</p>

  <p>"The little girl..."</p>

  <p>"This is not the supreme treasure of belief, is it? Is THIS the strongest creature in the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>When the red flame had vanished, they finally realized that Clark had indeed been burned to death!</p>

  <p>The woman, who had been stopped by Nicholas, was also stunned when she saw this scene. "How could it be?" She was aware that the True Demon Body had its own wisdom and was able to attack on its own, but she didn't expect it to be so powerful!</p>

  <p>Nicholas stared at the two girls and frowned. He was also panicking.</p>

  <p>"What happened? The True Demon Body is too powerful. How will anyone ever be able to control it?" Luo Zheng was also stumped.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen shook his head and said sadly, "Let's retreat for now and play it by ear!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the girl on the left smiled brightly at the crowd and gently waved at something or someone in the distance.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The crack leading to the outside suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>The faces of some Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods immediately darkened.</p>

  <p>"Th- Thank you," said the girl with red eyes with a pronounced lisp.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent.</p>

  <p>The mysterious woman pursed her lips and seemed to be contemplating.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was the only one who asked, "For what?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for bringing me sufficient food," the girl answered, managing to say it much more fluently than her first sentence.</p>

  <p>It would only take a few seconds for creatures of this level to master a language.</p>

  <p>Nicholas smiled softly and spoke in a kind tone, "If you go with me, we can offer you as much food as you like!"</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know how to refine the True Demon Body, Nicholas had planned to deceive her into going with him anyway.</p>

  <p>However, the little girl put on an innocent smile again and said, "It won't be that troublesome. All of you will be my food."</p>

  <p>These guys floating in the air were nothing but food for the girls.</p>

  <p>And who in their right mind could be bothered to cooperate with their food?</p>

  <p>The girl stretched out a finger and lazily pointed at Nicholas from a distance.</p>

  <p>The look on Nicholas's face changed dramatically. He retreated without hesitation.</p>

  <p>He moved at such a fast speed that nobody else could keep up to him!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a red light shone at the place where Nicholas had just been standing.</p>

  <p>The red light quickly transformed into a blossoming red lotus in the air.</p>

  <p>The red lotus was only the size of a palm, but its temperature was very high.</p>

  <p>Even though it was thousands of feet away, people could still feel the heat radiating from it.</p>

  <p>"You moved so fast!"</p>

  <p>The girl was astonished by Nicholas's pace.</p>

  <p>She was born many years ago.</p>

  <p>But she had always been in this ice coffin. In all these years, no one had spoken to her, and she did not know anything about the outside world.</p>

  <p>The only people she had encountered in the past were the mysterious woman and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>The woman had gained control over the clones of Sword Chen in order to enter the ice coffin. She had been so cautious every time. She had never said a word even when she had come into the Cold Fiends' lair at the bottom of the ice volcano.</p>

  <p>She was worried that the True Demon Body would develop intelligence.</p>

  <p>Regardless, her fears had come true. She frowned as she stared at the two girls.</p>

  <p>Now that the True Demon Body had developed its own intelligence, was all that planning in vain?</p>

  <p>While the woman was deep in thought, the girl with the red eyes began to attack once again!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>She moved through the void at a very high speed.</p>

  <p>However, Clark's death had put everyone else on high alert. As soon as the girl moved, the Holy Beings floating in the air immediately scattered in all directions in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>"You are my food!</p>

  <p>I need food!</p>

  <p>Come back to me! I'm hungry!"</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl laughed wickedly as she lunged at Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>"Why did you choose to come after me?"</p>

  <p>A look of helplessness appeared on Jeremiah's face. A gust of cold air spread out from him, transforming into a large ice wall that blocked him from her.</p>

  <p>Seizing the opportunity, he fled!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The girl blinked her eyes when she saw this.</p>

  <p>A red lotus appeared inside the ice wall. The ice wall quickly collapsed with a splash and turned into vapors thanks to the burning fire.</p>

  <p>The girl's intellect was growing rapidly as she negotiated these obstacles.</p>

  <p>Originally she had the intellect of a two- or three-year-old child. But after listening to these people's conversations, her intelligence grew as she picked up new information. So her brain was now equivalent to that of a four- or five-year-old child.</p>
