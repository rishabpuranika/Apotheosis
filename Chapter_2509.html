<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2509 Look For His Mom </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stayed in the Immortal Mansion for three days.</p>

  <p>During that time, Yan became acquainted with Yudie, Xun, and the others one by one.</p>

  <p>However, the person who interested Yan the most was her nephew.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was still exploring and cultivating in the bottle gourd, so Yan herself entered the bottle gourd to force him to get out.</p>

  <p>With his personality, everyone expected Luo Nian to rip his aunt's head off as soon as they came out of the bottle gourd.</p>

  <p>However, ever since then, Luo Nian was nothing but obedient to his aunt.</p>

  <p>Just like her brother Luo Zheng, Yan was strict and merciless toward Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>In the world inside the bottle gourd, she had taught him a good lesson and made him obedient to her.</p>

  <p>Three days later, just as Luo Zheng was about to leave with Harold, dim red light rose from the depths of the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>It was clearly visible even from a distance.</p>

  <p>The red light spiraled up like a tornado, containing a terrifying aura.</p>

  <p>A moment later, they heard shrill howls.</p>

  <p>"Judging from the volume of the voice, I can tell that it's coming from thirty thousand miles away from the Immortal Mansion. That's the center of the Swirl Forest," explained Harold, frowning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered slightly. "Are Hallet and Augustus in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they have met an obstacle," Harold answered, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>"Do they need our help?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Harold shook his head. "You're more important than them!"</p>

  <p>"But they? " Luo Zheng said worriedly, but before he could finish his sentence, Harold interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Our master and their master have already taken the possibility of failure into consideration. It is not your concern."</p>

  <p>A look of helplessness appeared on Luo Zheng's face. Harold's words were so stern that he couldn't argue.</p>

  <p>However, not long after they heard the shrill howls, a bright white light shot toward the Immortal Mansion. It was none other than Hallet.</p>

  <p>Hallet always had the look of an immortal being around him, as if he was the person in the fairy painting. However, at this moment, his body was covered all over with bruises, half his ear was missing, and his hand was burned black.</p>

  <p>It was not until he rushed into the Immortal Mansion that he noticed Harold and Luo Zheng. Seeing them, he was slightly taken aback. "Long time no see, Harold." Then, he asked with concern, "How's it going?"</p>

  <p>Of course, he was asking whether Luo Zheng had obtained the inheritance of the debate venue or not.</p>

  <p>With a smile on his face, Harold answered, "It was very successful."</p>

  <p>Hallet nodded. "That's good to hear."</p>

  <p>"How about you?" Harold asked, pointing to the center of the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>That crimson light was fading away. However, the fact that only Hallet was here worried them. Where was Augustus?</p>

  <p>"It's so troublesome! Luckily, Joy helped us to stall the Swirl Bird. It seems to have evolved during these years. Master failed to predict that!"</p>

  <p>Then, Hallet shrugged his shoulders and added, "But it doesn't matter. I can deal with it!"</p>

  <p>Harold was the first disciple of Mike, the master of the Luo Clan, and Hallet was the first disciple of Bromley, the master of the Gu Clan.</p>

  <p>Both of them were top figures among the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Although their masters had a good relationship with each other and belonged to the same side, Harold and Hallet couldn't help but compete against each other in terms of strength and ability.</p>

  <p>Ever since Harold had taken control of the Everest Spirit Mountain, Hallet had been itching to prove his worth. Unfortunately, he had had to wait until Luo Zheng entered the divine land before coming to the Swirl Forest? this was a direct order from his master, Bromley.</p>

  <p>Therefore, as soon as Luo Zheng had set foot on the divine land, Hallet had come to the Swirl Forest with Augustus.</p>

  <p>"I can help you, but I have to take Luo Zheng somewhere first," Harold said.</p>

  <p>However, Hallet waved his hand and said, "You'd better get your work done first. I don't need your help." Asking for Harold's help would mean that he was inferior to Harold? this was the last thing Hallet wanted anybody to think.</p>

  <p>Then, Hallet went straight to the pill refining workshop.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to obtain the control right of a sixth-grade forbidden area.</p>

  <p>For example, Harold had gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain many years ago, but it was only recently that he had really taken control of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. He is stubborn," Harold said with a smile playing on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure we are not going to help?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I will come back to help him after I take you there," Harold replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally felt at ease. His goal was to go to the Six-Burden Region to see his mother. When he arrived at the destination, all he needed to do was activate the token of mountain to send Harold back to the Immortal Mansion. It wouldn't take him much time. Besides, Hallet didn't seem to be in a hurry.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to go to the Six-Burden Region on his own, it would take him a long time to travel across one or two regions with his own speed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he might face some unexpected troubles in the process.</p>

  <p>After leaving Yan in the Immortal Mansion and saying goodbye to Yudie, Xun, and the rest, Luo Zheng and Harold left the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>As a consummate True God, Harold could use spatial transference. The distance he could travel was much shorter than Marsh and Joy, but he could use spatial transference much more frequently. Luo Zheng felt as if his body was moving through space again and again, and each time, the scene before his eyes changed dramatically. He didn't know how much distance he had traveled.</p>

  <p>About eight hours later, a large city appeared in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is the Six-Burden Divine City, the ancestral land of the Han Clan," said Harold. "Where is your mother?"</p>

  <p>"To the west of the Six-Burden Divine City, the Tie Clan," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>After confirming the specific location, Harold carried out another spatial transference with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng had just entered the divine land, it had taken him half a month to travel from the Six-Burden Divine City to the Tie Clan. But now, when they used spatial transference, they reached the Tie Clan in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>After they arrived, Harold flicked his finger, producing a milky-white curtain of light that immediately enveloped the two of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to disturb anyone here or attract too much attention to himself, and the light curtain helped by completely restraining both of their auras. After all, although the Tie Clan was only a third-tier clan, it had a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>In mid-air, Luo Zheng distinguished the location and said, "Here it is!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go down," said Harold as he led Luo Zheng down.</p>

  <p>The moment the two of them touched the earth, it melted away beneath their feet. The two of them shot toward the ground like arrows and sank into it.</p>

  <p>As he sank, Harold threw a white flag behind him.</p>

  <p>The flag flew straight out of the ground and pierced it. A gust of wind blew, and the flag grew larger in the wind, forming a magic array.</p>

  <p>This array flag was also a supreme treasure of the Luo Clan. No one but a consummate True God would be able to see it. And since there was almost no chance of any consummate True God getting close to this area, the array flag could protect this place from being discovered.</p>

  <p>Soon after they dived into the ground, Luo Zheng and Harold bumped into a gangue layer.</p>

  <p>An ordinary True God would find it hard to dig through the rocks, but for Harold, the gangue layer was as fragile as bean curd.</p>
