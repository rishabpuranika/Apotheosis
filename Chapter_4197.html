  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, floating above Luo Zheng, stared blankly at the countless dots of light in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Are all these the creatures of the main world locked in this Cold Prison?" asked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>All he knew about the Cold Prison, and little else, was that it was the most frigid place there was.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Luo Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Can you see their original appearances?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and so can you," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>A ball of green light burst out from the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in the primitive land. A whirring sound began to hum within the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The eyes of Luo Zheng and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord now glowed with a green light.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization could decipher the Cold Prison quickly.</p>

  <p>That was why it took only a moment for the original appearances of the countless light dots to become visible to Luo Zheng and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>"What a unique ability! It assessed the light dots and restored them just like that!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord exclaimed in awe. His eyes widened, however, when he realized what he was now looking at. "Are these human spirits?" he sputtered out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to distinguish between human spirits and human race from appearance alone. However, since the seventy-seventh chaotic era, only the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had set foot in the Jade Pure Realm, so he knew it was impossible for any other human to be here.</p>

  <p>These human spirits must have been in the Cold Prison for many years.</p>

  <p>They were wrapped in the same golden armors and lay side by side, motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid these human spirits may be dead," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said gingerly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so." Luo Zheng shook his head. "I know of a giant who survived the Cold Prison in the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage, and his strength was far inferior to that of human spirits."</p>

  <p>The giant Pompeo was born after the change of Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He was powerful as a creature of that world, but he was much weaker than the human spirits.</p>

  <p>If Pompeo could emerge from the ordeal safe and sound, so, too, could human spirits.</p>

  <p>"You could know for sure if you check the Cold Prison yourself, but I don't know if your body can withstand it," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suggested with some hesitation in his voice.</p>

  <p>The power of the Cold Prison was overwhelming. It literally could freeze everything. Luo Zheng wouldn't have dared to enter it in the past.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's body was no longer the same after the ancestry-level bloodline strengthened it. Moreover, he could also use the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it a try."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was much more confident to take the Cold Prison on now.</p>

  <p>He approached slowly and reached out to touch its surface.</p>

  <p>A burning sensation flashed through him. The pain lasted only for a split second, however, as his entire body turned to ice on the spot.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Cold Prison not only froze every tissue in Luo Zheng's body but also affected his inner world.</p>

  <p>The frigid air went straight into Luo Zheng's cinnabar field and started seeping through the blood-colored sky. Left unhampered, it would be enough to freeze the entire primitive land and kill most of the creatures living in it.</p>

  <p>It never got to that point, however.</p>

  <p>The moment the cold air invaded, the ancestry-level bloodline had immediately launched a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Energy spiraled and gathered in the center of the blood-colored sky, forming a golden sun. The freezing mist immediately dissipated wherever the sunlight shone.</p>

  <p>With the cold air extinguished, light beams rushed out from Luo Zheng's cinnabar field. The blazing energy flowed through his body, quickly thawing him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned to normal, but not without a lecture from the ancestry-level bloodline. "Next time, before you do such a dangerous thing, inform me first."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hung his head in embarrassment. "I had wanted to analyze the Cold Prison first, but I didn't expect it could freeze me that fast," Luo Zheng admitted sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"There's no time for analysis in this place. You have to prepare in advance," the ancestry-level bloodline chastised.</p>

  <p>"Could I enter the Cold Prison now, though?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you may."</p>

  <p>The sun in the primitive land now blazed heat throughout Luo Zheng's body, enabling him to endure the subzero temperatures around him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng now stepped into the Cold Prison with ease.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The low temperature of the Cold Prison was offset by the high temperature in Luo Zheng's body, ending in a neutral state. A thin mist rose from Luo Zheng, making him look like a white bear, but he could move freely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to the human spirits and inspected them.</p>

  <p>They were still alive, with a rich amount of life energy still contained in their bodies. When Luo Zheng touched their heads, he discovered, however, that their minds were empty. It was as if they had lost their souls.</p>

  <p>"Well? What have you found out?" The voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suddenly piped up in Luo Zheng's mind. His remnant soul wouldn't be able to withstand the Cold Prison, so he could only hide within Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"They have lost their souls." Luo Zheng frowned and shook his head. "Or more precisely, their Treacherous Beings. To human spirits, after all, the Treacherous Beings are their souls. There are no Treacherous Beings in their minds. These are just living husks."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng went to check several other human spirits and found only the same situation.</p>

  <p>"I shall go further on and have a look."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exited the Cold Prison and moved along the snake-shaped road.</p>

  <p>There were golden-armored human spirits lying on both sides of the snake-shaped road along the first thousand feet or so. From that point on, the human spirits lying on the ground wore cyan armors.</p>

  <p>It would seem those in the cyan armors were stronger than those in the golden ones.</p>

  <p>At some point even further on, the human spirits, beautiful women among them, started sporting a variety of luxury clothes instead of armors. Luo Zheng went inside the Cold Prison to check again. Indeed, no souls remained either in the men or the women.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued on along the meandering road.</p>

  <p>The road grew wider and wider until it diverged into three paths. Where the left and right paths ended were visible from this distance. But the middle path was obscured by a gate of carved ice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the left path.</p>

  <p>At the end was a burly man seated on an ice throne.</p>

  <p>He seemed familiar, but Luo Zheng couldn't remember where he had seen him before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked back to the crossroad and took the right path this time. At the end was a woman, again seated on an ice throne.</p>

  <p>The woman looked very young. She sat sideways on the throne, her legs dangling stylishly from the armrest.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had gotten close enough to see the woman's face, however, his eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Dorothy?!" he blurted out.</p>
