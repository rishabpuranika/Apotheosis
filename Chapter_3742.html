<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>They had to step carefully since, according to Elizabeth, the Cold Prisons were horrible and dangerous.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the prisons were special. The temperature inside was indeed extremely low, but it would not hurt them even if they got very close.</p>

  <p>"Did you say that the Cold Prisons are not the coldest, but the third coldest?" Zheng asked questioning how that could be true.</p>

  <p>From what he had seen just now, it seemed the temperature inside was already low to the extreme. Under such a temperature, even time and space had undergone a qualitative change; he found it hard to imagine an environment that could be colder than that.</p>

  <p>"You will soon see the second coldest place," said Elizabeth. "But the place with the lowest temperature on the Other Shore is said to be on Stage Thirty-three. I have only heard of it, never seen it."</p>

  <p>"I'll soon see the second coldest place..."</p>

  <p>Zheng repeated to himself, trying to restrain his curiosity. He walked slowly on the path between the Cold Prisons, under the protection of the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>It took them about an hour to pass through the low-lying area filled with Cold Prisons and then, a huge frozen structure appeared before Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A temple?" Zheng wondered as he looked at it closely.</p>

  <p>"It could be, but no one can be sure," Elizabeth replied shrugging her shoulders.</p>

  <p>It looked like a frozen temple, but its style was very unique in that it looked more like a huge metal box than a traditional temple.</p>

  <p>"What civilization would construct a temple like this?" Libby asked shaking her head in confusion and astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Has anyone explored this temple before?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth shook her head. "Look carefully at the ice on the outer layer."</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at it for a while and then raised his eyebrows slightly at what he discovered.</p>

  <p>This layer of ice gave off a great deal of pressure, somewhat similar to that of the Cold Prisons.</p>

  <p>"This box has the second lowest temperature," Elizabeth said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"In a Cold Prison, it would take almost all the water in a sea to create a thumb-sized ice cube. Look over there..."</p>

  <p>Not far away, on the left, was a very special looking Cold Prison. The others were empty, but this Cold Prison held a small ice cube the size of a thumb in the center...</p>

  <p>Zheng's jaw dropped slightly as he thought of what Elizabeth had just said.</p>

  <p>"That ice cube is..."</p>

  <p>"It used to have the same amount of water as that in the whole Bright Sea Province," Elizabeth said before Zheng could finish his words.</p>

  <p>Within the Bright Sea Province was an island and a city, and the rest was all sea.</p>

  <p>"A whole sea condensed to only a thumb-sized cube. Then the ice around this huge metal box..." Libby took a deep breath as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"It would take an enormous amount of water to condense it to surround this metal box. How could there be so much water in this world?" Zheng asked utterly astounded and dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth smiled and revealed, "That mystery is still unsolved. Or at least the Element Spirit race could not solve it."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore had many similar mysteries and secrets spread throughout.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had been active on the Other Shore for more than one thousand chaotic eras, yet they still hadn't been able to figure it out.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and moved around the metal box under the shield.</p>

  <p>He had felt a sense of familiarity when he first saw this metal box. Its shape was very similar to that of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>But the shape was quite simple and common, so it wasn't strange that they looked alike. He decided not to say anything in the end.</p>

  <p>But then, just as Zheng and the others walked from behind the metal box to the front, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice suddenly rang out. "Zheng, the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization has issued a task again."</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly stunned to hear this.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been issuing tasks tirelessly, but Zheng was not interested in receiving any of them and thus ignored them.</p>

  <p>However, ever since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had entered his inner world, a person had been sent specifically to guard the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>This person classified and recorded every task issued by the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>The recorder was never tired of the work, recording all tasks and classifying them according to different levels; heaven-level, earth-level, first-class, second-class and so on. He recorded everything, not missing a word, and then meticulously reported them to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Today, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had suddenly issued a task.</p>

  <p>"Special task: return to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization!</p>

  <p>Reward: nothing!"</p>

  <p>This strange task stunned the recorder.</p>

  <p>The tasks issued were never the same. The level and class of the tasks, as well as the reward that would be offered for completing them, would be announced clearly.</p>

  <p>Now, the Civilization Aircraft suddenly issued such an unusual task, which baffled the recorder.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had also warned him that he should report anything unusual to him immediately. This was one of those cases and so the recorder hurriedly reported it to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who then promptly brought it to Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>"Special task...</p>

  <p>Return to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face twisted strangely at what he had just learned.</p>

  <p>If this was what was now put before him, then the Heavenly Obsession Civilization must have something to do with this huge metal box. Was this the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization?</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng, Elizabeth and Libby made it to the front of the box.</p>

  <p>Just then, something began to change.</p>

  <p>A speck of red light flickered dimly on the metal box...</p>

  <p>It spread from the bottom to the top of the metal box, which then began trembling vaguely.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?"</p>

  <p>This switched Elizabeth's expression dramatically.</p>

  <p>This huge metal box had stood on the upper ice field for countless years.</p>

  <p>No one had even gotten close to it, let alone seen it move.</p>

  <p>The sudden change had startled her.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The ice on the surface of the metal box cracked.</p>

  <p>If a thumb-sized ice cube would require the water of a sea to be condensed into it, one could only imagine the kind of power needed to break such thick ice.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Hurry!"</p>

  <p>An ice block the size of a fist fell from above and crashed into the ice field.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>This highly condensed ice block held an amount of water equivalent to a huge sea the size of several provinces.</p>

  <p>The upper ice field was unable to support it at all. The ice block smashed right into it, penetrating the thick layer of ice, and smashing into the lower ice field.</p>

  <p>Luckily, this area on the lower ice field was unpopulated. The ice block had not fallen on any living creatures. The only damage caused was a small pit in the ground, left by the ice block before it disappeared without a trace...</p>

  <p>Many more ice blocks fell similarly.</p>

  <p>To be safe, Zheng, Elizabeth and Libby had all retreated. A long while later, most of the blocks of ice at the front of the metal box had fallen off.</p>

  <p>A dark red light silently began glowing to reveal the outline of a door.</p>

  <p>"It has a door. Does that mean we can go inside?" Elizabeth was overtaken by excitement.</p>

  <p>She had passed by here many times and had always regarded this place as forbidden and not to be approached. Anyone who witnessed this sudden change would be as excited as she now was.</p>
