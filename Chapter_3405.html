<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment those huge eyes opened, everyone in the cave felt as if their hearts were clenched in an icy grip. They quavered in fear.</p>

  <p>Some of them could feel a sharp sword pointed at their foreheads. If the sword were to be thrust one inch closer, it would pierce their skulls and they would die.</p>

  <p>Some of the people in the cave could see they were surrounded by skeletons. This was frightening. Had they arrived in the death world, where no living being existed? Were they doomed to become like the skeletons?</p>

  <p>Most of them covered their heads with their hands, horrified. Naturally, they thought they were going to die.</p>

  <p>Although most of them had been through many dangers, now, they were terror-stricken. Each of them felt like they were at death's door, knocking loudly.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng and Khalid, possessing the powerful Souls of Light, were not immune to this fear. Zheng had to retreat after he landed, and at the same time fight against the fear of the Dreaded Eye Demon with his strong will.</p>

  <p>Zheng had gone through something like this before in the Sacred Mallow Temple. At that time, after No. 9527 prompted him, he was able to shut it out using the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, the fear which descended on him now was many times stronger than what he encountered in the Sacred Mallow Temple. The Emotion Closing Godly Way was unable to banish the fright.</p>

  <p>"Flow Strike!"</p>

  <p>Desperate for a solution, Zheng pulled out another one of his skills? the Flow Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The Flow Strike was regarded as an extension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, with a meditation component. It was a more effective way of cultivating the heart.</p>

  <p>While staying in the Flow Sword Sect, Zheng had come a long way as far as his training went.</p>

  <p>But the mind method of the Flow Swordsmanship had little effect on that fear. He was unable to completely erase it.</p>

  <p>The others were even worse.</p>

  <p>Most of them prostrated themselves on the ground. Some of them were looking ashen, some were trembling and the rest were crying bitterly.</p>

  <p>Yan stood still with a confused look, as if she were also using some kind of mental method to filter out the fear.</p>

  <p>At the top of the main peak, the dark and red lights continued to flicker on the surface of the giant eye.</p>

  <p>The giant eye was the source of the fear, naturally emanating it and affecting everyone.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Khalid were targets chosen by the eye and the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. It did not want anything to go wrong in the fight between those two.</p>

  <p>However, Khalid reacted recklessly. When the battle began, the giant eye had to interfere.</p>

  <p>"What if they find out about your meddling?" asked the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>She was afraid they would escape, and leave the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>After all, no one was willing to let their prey run away like that.</p>

  <p>"There shouldn't be a problem," the giant eye replied. "They haven't acquired enough Chaotic Source Spirits, so they won't put a halt to the competition and take off."</p>

  <p>The giant eye wasn't willing to reveal its ability now, but it had no choice.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light in its pupil lasted for 30 seconds before it disappeared and the eye went back to its former condition.</p>

  <p>The red and white lights slowly revolved around its pupil.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the main peak, many members and disciples from different races, who thought they were on the verge of death, found that the fear had suddenly dissipated, and they stood up with strange expressions.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"It scared me!"</p>

  <p>"I thought I was going to die!"</p>

  <p>The fear made people feel like they were taking a walking tour of hell, and they glistened with sweat.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, that power of fear is from the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>But what kind of thing is it? Why could it affect so many people?" Mya asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Mya knew the Truth of Goodwill and Malice very well, as she cultivated it.</p>

  <p>After reaching the consummate level of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, she could also frighten a large number of creatures. If one had a weak soul, they would be frightened to death.</p>

  <p>However, for the Souls of Light that had reached the Other Shore, that effect was simply negligible. Ordinary warriors were immune, unless she was able to fuse with a related Other Shore Token, or to cultivate the theurgy of this aspect.</p>

  <p>Mount was powerful and smart. As far as Mya was concerned, there was nothing that Mount didn't know.</p>

  <p>"That's the Dreaded Eye Demon. It was a mighty ruling force in the past, but the force didn't fare well on the Other Shore and the Dreaded Eye Demons are almost extinct," Mount replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"So why is it here?" Mya asked.</p>

  <p>In Mya's eyes, both the items and living creatures on the Other Shore should use a medium to descend in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The medium was the inner world of a powerful Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Mount answered with a frown.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Chaotic Source Spirits had already broken with routine and lived in the Chaotic Source World in a special form.</p>

  <p>Essentially, the Chaotic Source Spirits were also the creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Why were the Chaotic Source Spirits different from other creatures on the Other Shore? Every super force had looked into that, but the reason had not been found.</p>

  <p>It could be said that it was completely against the truth when the Chaotic Source Spirits lived in a special form like that.</p>

  <p>Once they found out why, the strong existences hiding on the Other Shore and the powerful masters of the ruling civilizations would probably be able to return to the Source World, and even the chaos.</p>

  <p>After Zheng regained consciousness, he just stared at Khalid coldly.</p>

  <p>He thought of killing Khalid, but then the fear rose in him. This was not a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Knowing this, Zheng ventured a guess.</p>

  <p>What had just happened was obvious to him now. A Dreaded Eye Demon must be hovering on top of the main peak. That monster was much stronger than the Eye of Will Zheng had fused with!</p>

  <p>"Why did it stop me from killing Khalid? Or did it just stop me from fighting him?"</p>

  <p>Zheng thought it must be the latter. But why?</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Khalid had entered the Chaotic Source World. He didn't seem to know anything about that either.</p>

  <p>Why would the Dreaded Eye Demon do that?</p>

  <p>Zheng was consumed with figuring this out, and hesitated to act before he did.</p>

  <p>He and Yan led the members of the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace to retreat to the other side, distancing themselves from the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>At this time, in another passageway, dozens of tall figures entered. They were from the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The members of this race gathered and formed three teams in the Chaotic Source World. One of the teams encountered the Evil God, while the other two teams banded together and climbed up the main peak.</p>

  <p>This time, the trip to the Chaotic Source World was not easy for them, and they were much more cautious as a result. Many Separate Abyss warriors, over a hundred feet tall, looked at the sculptures on the walls and gathered off to one side.</p>

  <p>More and more members of different races came into the cave through the passageways around it.</p>

  <p>Most were in groups, but there were some warriors who came there alone.</p>

  <p>For example, Milo from the Oneness Sky Palace explored the main peak all by himself. He remained in the Chaotic Source World for a long time, and now he finally threw in his lot with Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding in the upper part of the cave!"</p>

  <p>"Let's just make our way up and dig them out!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is no place to hide except the upper part of the main peak!"</p>

  <p>When there were more warriors in the cave, it became quite noisy inside.</p>

  <p>They talked about the best way to climb the mountain.</p>

  <p>As for the members of the Separate Abyss race, they were impetuous. Two of them flew up and shot toward the upper part of the cave with their huge bodies as large as the hills.</p>

  <p>However, when the two Separate Abyss warriors just approached the top, they suddenly let out a scream, and fell down, holding their heads in their hands. They formed a huge crater when they smashed into the ground.</p>
