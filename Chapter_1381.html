<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1381 The Prototype </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the most part, there was no actual suspense regarding the contest results in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>Layla had not only broken the record set by Supreme Lord Illusion, but had also set a new record herself.</p>

  <p>She had raised the bar higher by setting a record that was even more difficult to beat.</p>

  <p>To put it simply, beating her record would be like turning the world upside down? impossible!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had broken the record set by Supreme Lord Illusion. In spite of that, everyone was convinced that he wouldn't be able to break Layla's incredible record.</p>

  <p>Eighteen thousand miles was already an insurmountable record, let alone twenty-eight thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng was the last person to come out of the Enchanted Barrier Tower, everyone's attention was focused on him.</p>

  <p>As time went by, Luo Luo Zheng remained motionless in the Enchanted Barrier Tower like a monk in meditation, as if he was trying to comprehend something.</p>

  <p>Layla curled her lips and darkened her eyebrows. Her eyes shone bright, reflecting the strong light from the sun.</p>

  <p>Despite the first eighteen thousand miles being a bottleneck, it was relatively easy to finish. Beyond it, the Law Power was compressed to the limit.</p>

  <p>All of the law fragments were condensed together to form the dark Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Earlier when Supreme Lord Illusion stopped here, it was most likely due to the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>However, Layla did not linger there for even a moment. After she opened Wrath of the Ocean, her focus kept her rushing on forward.</p>

  <p>Although the dark Law Storm was fierce, it didn't pose much of a threat to Layla.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, everyone else wondered what was going on inside Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Two minutes had passed.</p>

  <p>Five minutes...</p>

  <p>One hour...</p>

  <p>Two hours...</p>

  <p>Four hours...</p>

  <p>The heads of the palaces and the lord of Sunset World, however, remained calm. After all, they were all strong and experienced warriors.</p>

  <p>To them, this length of time was like a fleeting moment.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the warriors in the plaza were starting to become a little anxious.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they were feeling impatient.</p>

  <p>After all, they had gone through countless tough training and boring practices to become so strong and resilient.</p>

  <p>A mere few hours of waiting was nothing to them. Sometimes, when they practiced closed door cultivation, they would spend at least an entire year with no one but themselves to keep them company.</p>

  <p>However, Passing the Torch did not consist of only one trial in the Enchanted Barrier Tower. They were eagerly looking forward to the next trial. With this expectation, it wouldn't be a surprise if they felt as though time was passing dreadfully slowly.</p>

  <p>"What is Luo Luo Zheng doing? He is wasting everyone's time."</p>

  <p>"Who knows? There's nothing we can do about it. The next trial of Passing the Torch will not be activated unless he comes out of the Enchanted Barrier Tower."</p>

  <p>"If he wants to continue, he needs to hurry up! He has already broken Supreme Lord Illusion's record. That's more than enough. What else does he want? To beat Layla's record?"</p>

  <p>The complaints of thousands of eager people filled every corner of the place.</p>

  <p>Yolande, whose pale eyes were narrowed and without so much as a glint, was also filled with immense curiosity.</p>

  <p>What was Luo Luo Zheng thinking about?</p>

  <p>Woosh...woosh...woosh...</p>

  <p>The Law Storm swirled around violently in a spiral pattern in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was divided into different levels.</p>

  <p>At one thousand miles, the law fragments were still scattered, and gathering them together was no easy feat. Even after the initial condensation had occurred, what they formed were just tiny fragments of Law Power, which could only amass short wind blades or tiny fireballs.</p>

  <p>However, after three thousand miles, the fragments of the Law Storm had gathered together on a massive scale.</p>

  <p>The further one went, the more condensed they were. After ten thousand miles, those law fragments would take shape on a massive scale. Their attacks would become even more terrifying and formidable.</p>

  <p>From ten thousand miles to eighteen thousand miles, despite the continual increase of power, there weren't any significant changes in the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the Law Storm in front of Luo Luo Zheng had already been condensed to its limit. Multicolored laws had gathered together, swirling like a vast, gray fog.</p>

  <p>At first glance, the speed at which the Law Storm circulated seemed much slower than before, but in reality, because of the compression of the various laws, it was much more difficult to advance forward in them.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Luo Zheng had stopped here was not that he was unable to pass the Law Storm, but that he had discovered that the highly condensed Law Storm was actually extremely similar to the chaotic energy in his body.</p>

  <p>'By condensing all of the Original Laws to the limit, one will get the prototype of the chaotic energy. In fact the similarity is staggering, '</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pondered as he stared at the Law Storm in front of him.</p>

  <p>'The Original Laws of the Law Storm are the result of several Supreme Lords exchanging blows with each other. They transformed the vitality between heaven and earth into the Law Powers, making them interweave and compress until finally they became like this.</p>

  <p>All life evolved from the primal chaos, and the Original Laws are the foundation of all life in this universe.'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes started to glow like tiny balls of fire.</p>

  <p>The vitality of heaven and earth could be harnessed by martial artists that cultivated the life vitality system.</p>

  <p>According to this theory, these highly condensed Law Power already had the properties of chaotic energy. And now, Luo Luo Zheng was the first to learn the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>Could he master the Law Storm?</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng no longer hesitated. He chanted the spells of the Primal Chaos Technique in his heart and began to trigger the condensed Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's master had placed the chaotic energy in Luo Zheng's elixir field, and then Luo Luo Zheng slowly refined it.</p>

  <p>At the moment, however, Luo Luo Zheng didn't use the chaotic energy within his body. Instead, like a martial artist cultivating the life vitality system, he used the Primal Chaos Technique to make the Law Storm swirl in reverse, controlling it like the vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Even his master hadn't expected such an outcome. After all, the chaotic energy in the universe was very little to no.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't inflexible. As a warrior, he loved exploring new things. More importantly, even his master himself did not cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique. Since Luo Luo Zheng had chosen to be a practitioner, he could only comprehend it, study it, and improve on his own.</p>

  <p>Three seconds later, his body started to emit an invisible force, wrapping his body.</p>

  <p>A smirk appeared on his face as he sat there and closed his eyes. The Law Storm in front of him seemed to be affected by the force and started to swirl in two opposite directions.</p>

  <p>The gray Law Storm was constantly swirling, but at a slow speed. It was spinning slightly unnaturally due to the influence of Luo Zheng's Primal Chaos Technique, but the lord of Sunset World outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower, Yolande and the other heads of the palaces did not notice anything amiss.</p>

  <p>Soon, someone shouted, "Finally this guy has stood up!"</p>

  <p>"Does he plan to leave the Enchanted Barrier Tower or continue to move forward?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like he's starting to move forward."</p>

  <p>"He's actually walking with his legs."</p>

  <p>"He's finally flying."</p>

  <p>"He is still very slow."</p>

  <p>"He is accelerating! Wow, he is moving really fast!"</p>

  <p>"But... he still hasn't used his life vitality! It seems like he isn't using any secret techniques. So how can he be so fast?"</p>

  <p>"Oh God!"</p>

  <p>The practitioners, on one side of the plaza, who had been complaining nonstop before, were now clamoring again. Of course, this time they weren't complaining about Luo Zheng's delay, but rather they were amazed at his speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was advancing even faster than Layla from before.</p>

  <p>The heads of palaces, at this moment, had very interesting expressions on their faces. The lord of Sunset World was looking at Luo Luo Zheng attentively.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew why Layla was able to travel 28, 000 miles at such a high speed. She did so by opening the Wrath of the Ocean.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was relying only on his own strength. Despite his vast knowledge and experience, the lord of Sunset World was unable to figure out how he did it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng seems to be even more powerful than Layla," one of the heads of the palaces exclaimed, mouth agape in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"That seems to be the case, but he still hasn't covered twenty thousand miles. I don't think he will be able to break Layla's record," argued another palace leader.</p>

  <p>Yolande remained indifferent just as she was before, but the corners of her mouth curved into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The surprise in Layla's eyes was undeniable as she stood on the top floor.</p>

  <p>However, after she pursed her lips, she faintly said to herself, "I know you won't stop at 18, 000 miles, otherwise you wouldn't be fit to be my rival. But to go beyond 28, 000 miles is impossible!"</p>
