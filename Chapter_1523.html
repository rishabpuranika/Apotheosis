<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hide his Mu Ning. His eyes glinted fiercely as he approached Ezra.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ezra got too excited that he ignored the person behind him.</p>

  <p>He suddenly turned around when Luo Zheng was just three steps away from him. Since he was under the Bronze Blood's control, he acted out of instinct without any thought!</p>

  <p>Ezra hadn't even seen Luo Zheng clearly before he subconsciously attacked Luo Zheng out of reflex.</p>

  <p>The massive pair of bloody axes flashed with a blood-red light and smelled thickly of blood. The axes swung down heavily in a horizontal manner, like two brushes painting a bloody piece in front of him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The axes emitted a powerful Mu Ning in each heavy swing.</p>

  <p>Ezra's attack under the Bronze Blood's activation had no moves--because he didn't need to use any!</p>

  <p>His attack's violent power felt like it could crush mountains and the earth. Everything within the axes' slash's radius were obliterated without a second thought.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of martial artists would choose to retreat and look for another opportunity in the face of such an attack.</p>

  <p>It was an absolutely unwise choice to confront an ogre martial artist-- especially one who had activated the Bronze Blood!</p>

  <p>Despite all the odds, Luo Zheng did not retreat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still firmly stood three inches from the bloody axes, no matter how fast or heavy the weapons were swung.</p>

  <p>He was like a butterfly in the eye of a storm. The strong wind could destroy houses and trees; but the little butterfly would always dance along with the wind.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists who hid in the main city were all dumbfounded when they saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The main city lay a bit farther away from Luo Zheng, so he seemed like he was glued to the bloody axes from the martial artists' point of view.</p>

  <p>The scene created an illusion. It was as if Ezra wanted to throw Luo Zheng off the axes, rather than chop him off with them. However, Ezra couldn't get rid of him no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"What did this guy do? How did he do it?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he practiced a very strange cultivation method and glued himself to the bloody axes!"</p>

  <p>"But that doesn't sound right… if he was stuck on them, why wouldn't Ezra smash the axes on the ground to kill him?"</p>

  <p>Numerous ogre warriors discussed and argued among themselves about what was happening to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Ezra had indeed done so, just as they finished talking. This kind of illusion wasn't a rare thing for martial artists--thus, Ezra too, had a strange feeling that this man was stuck to his axes.</p>

  <p>With the pair of bloody axes raised high in the air, Ezra proceeded to heavily swing them downwards!</p>

  <p>As gravity pulled the axes down, Luo Zheng had somehow strangely squeezed out from the gap between the axes' edges and the ground when he was three inches above the floor line.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The two bloody axes hit the ground with a loud thud and immediately created a huge fissure.</p>

  <p>The crack continued to extend in all directions, and exceeded more than ten miles. It could even form a small canyon.</p>

  <p>"What the hell!"</p>

  <p>"This human warrior is really odd. He seems like a slippery leech that can't be caught!"</p>

  <p>Once again, all the warriors behind the city wall were all stunned!</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng's body floated at the end of the bloody axes. His feet were still three inches away from their blades.</p>

  <p>Even Ezra, who was still under the influence of the Bronze Blood, couldn't help but pause and stare at this man in front of him!</p>

  <p>"It's you!"</p>

  <p>Ezra had finally recognized Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If his memory served him right, he was one of the two human warriors he had met at the beginning of the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>It seemed that Ezra had misjudged them at that time. He never thought that those two human warriors were so powerful that they had instantly killed eleven ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>Even then, Ezra still didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>For him, real powerhouses would choose methods such as blocking the city gate and collecting points. Thus, he thought that these two human warriors chose to leave because they felt confident of themselves.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that the method of blocking the city gates was inefficient, as no one was willing to leave the city to risk their lives now?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng thought a warrior like Ezra who used a method like blocking the city gates was like a sheep that ate grass. Now that he had returned, he would definitely choose to slaughter this sheep...</p>

  <p>"It's me," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Well, well. Let's see how far you can escape!" Ezra said and laughed wildly. Although he dreaded Zheng's strange movement technique, he didn't feel any fear under the influence of the Bronze Blood. The pair of bloody axes split apart and attacked Luo Zheng from both of his sides.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was hit by the bloody axes, he'd end up getting chopped into pieces.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, Luo Zheng didn't dodge!</p>

  <p>He stretched his arms and stared at Ezra after he dispersed the white smoke from his body, a smile plastered on his face.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Zheng's hands were like two agile snakes that slithered quickly as he grasped the bloody axes' blades.</p>

  <p>Ezra attacked with all his might. His slashing movements were even strong enough to split a mountain!</p>

  <p>Therefore, almost all the warriors thought that Luo Zheng would use that bizarre movement technique of his to dodge the attacks.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng being Luo Zheng was quite unpredictable: not only did he avoid dodging, he directly stretched out his hands and grabbed the bloody axes' blades with his bare hands! All of Zheng's ten fingers were deeply embedded on the bloody axes' surface, which dug ten deep grooves on the divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the main city quieted down.</p>

  <p>It was known that ogre martial artists were naturally ruthless, and wherever they gathered was always noisy due to their massive size. The sky shook the moment they opened their mouths. The bad thing was, there weren't many things that could keep them quiet!</p>

  <p>However, something that defied common sense happened in front of them…</p>

  <p>This human martial artist had actually used his bare hands to grasp Ezra's dual axes!</p>

  <p>All the races in the universe had their own specialties. It could also be said that each race was fond of displaying their strengths to the extreme.</p>

  <p>For instance, cultivating life vitality suited humans, ogre warriors were best at body tempering, and the Demon Night warriors were naturally strong. Thus, it wasn't bad to choose any of them to cultivate.</p>

  <p>There was a 99% chance that an ogre martial artist would choose to refine their body, and this Ezra was one of the most outstanding body refiners of the ogre race. On the other hand, this human warrior seemed to be a martial artist that cultivated the life vitality.</p>

  <p>They did not sense any fluctuations of the life vitality from his body, but he had actually used his bare hands to catch Ezra's two bloody axes!</p>

  <p>Thus, the ogre martial artists thought they had just seen a monster!</p>

  <p>Not to mention, to be defeated at something he was supposedly adept at was an unbearable setback, and a huge blow to Ezra.</p>

  <p>What was even worse was that all of Zheng's fingers had made dents on his secondary first-rank divine weapon!</p>

  <p>This was a secondary first-rank divine weapon. The bloody axes were huge and thick, and were far harder than any sword, spear, saber, or other similar weapons. Weapons like axes and hammers at the same rank consumed several times more materials, but they were also much tougher.</p>

  <p>Sadly, the truth was laid out in front of them. Many ogre martial artists subconsciously shook their heads, as if they didn't want to believe this; but their eyes didn't lie to them.</p>

  <p>"How did he do it…"</p>

  <p>"There weren't any fluctuations of life vitality. This human didn't seem to have cultivated the life vitality system!"</p>

  <p>"No, that's not right. He isn't a body refiner either. I didn't sense the eruption of his forceful energy!"</p>

  <p>Many ogre martial artists were silently transfixed on Luo Zheng for a while, before they began to talk about him all at once in especially loud voices.</p>

  <p>Then, they came to an even more frightening conclusion amidst their discussions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't rely on his life vitality or his forceful energy. He used his physical body and his own strength instead to block the two axes.</p>

  <p>"Where did this freak come from..." one of the ogre martial artists murmured. But of course, Ezra was probably countless times more shocked than the spectators.</p>

  <p>He had the Bronze Blood and he was a descendant of a golden family of ogre race.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't compare to those world lords' or the Supreme Lords' descendants, he was still more than enough to become a core disciple of a tenth-grade sacred place! He was excellent in both aspects, be it talent or bloodline.</p>

  <p>The Bronze Blood could increase his strength by more than three times after it had burst. Combined with his cultivation of the blood strengthening forceful energy, even a warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm wouldn't withstand the might of his axes!</p>

  <p>However, this human warrior who didn't even look built or sturdy at all, had just squeezed his axes with his bare hands?</p>

  <p>He felt a deep sense of humiliation within him as he looked at the smile on Zheng's face. To make things even worse, he couldn't pull out his pair of bloody axes!</p>
