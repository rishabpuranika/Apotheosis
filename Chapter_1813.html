<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1813 Threat (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment started moving almost simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The giant hand slammed down on Luo Luo Zheng at a very rapid speed. Even the formless power unleashed by Master Feng was instantly torn apart, unable to block it in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think we are afraid of a True God?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle's expression was as cold as an arctic ice. The short sword in her hand immediately transformed into a sharp stream of light in the air, lighting up the entire place.</p>

  <p>The stream of light split into many jagged long hooks, and, with quick succession, hooked into the giant hand.</p>

  <p>Earlier in the fight, Supreme Lord of Oracle had already witnessed the might of this giant hand, so she did not dare to underestimate its strength.</p>

  <p>She merely wanted to block its attacks.</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, he jumped into the air and morphed into a Buddha. With one quick step, he was already in front of Luo Luo Zheng, determined to stop this giant hand.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin's expression turned solemn and focused as he disappeared from where he stood, nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>As for the other Supreme Lords, they stood in shock and were caught mentally unprepared. They could not fathom what was happening. Could it be that they were about to start a war with the Sacred race right now?</p>

  <p>If the owner of this giant hand came out, how would the Supreme Lords manage to resist its powers?</p>

  <p>Soon, all of the Supreme Lords' worries banished into thin air when a new figure joined them.</p>

  <p>A peal of laughter rang in the air as a lean shadow slowly materialized in the space beside Luo Luo Zheng. When the old man finally appeared, he extended his withering hand and tapped the palm of the giant hand with his finger.</p>

  <p>There was no contact between the two, but the giant hand seemed to have eyes. As if it could sense the power of the finger, it suddenly maneuvered differently and changed its style in mid-air. The fingers on the palm straightened and turned into a palm knife.</p>

  <p>The old man kept a straight face while his dexterous fingers changed their movements. He touched his thumb with his pinky finger and pointed toward the wrist of the giant hand.</p>

  <p>The hand gestures between the two constantly changed, as if two drunkards were playing a drinkers' wager game. Notably, there wasn't a single substantive exchange of blows between them, which surprised the onlookers.</p>

  <p>Every time the hand changed its pattern, the old man's hand would also change along with it to counter its moves.</p>

  <p>In the end...</p>

  <p>The giant hand finally stopped moving and its attacks came to a halt.</p>

  <p>A sharp icy voice suddenly boomed from the center of the nine Supreme Lords, "I didn't expect that a disciple of a Holy Being like you would be hiding in the universe, fighting for your life. So you really aren't dead yet."</p>

  <p>"I will never die," the old man replied with a cool smile.</p>

  <p>"It's never too late," the voice bit back.</p>

  <p>The old man laughed and said, "You should worry about yourself and your son's life first ... We'll take his life."</p>

  <p>He did not even spare Maha any glance when he said this, like he was not anyone important to discuss. For the old man, his life wasn't worth wasting time for.</p>

  <p>As the old man's voice fell silent, Supreme Lord of Original Sin transported beside Maha, a black spear held tight in his hand which he positioned against Maha's forehead.</p>

  <p>Maha was the Sacred race's Godly Genius and had the highest chance of becoming a True God. Not only that, he was also the True God's son. If they could kill him, then it would be extremely beneficial for everyone in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>There was a long period of tensed silence before the voice spoke again, saying, "If you dare to kill my son, I will leave the Sacred race behind and kill you. Then I will destroy this universe. Kill him and I swear I will do as I say."</p>

  <p>A sly challenging smile made its way onto the old man's face. "You really can't get here, huh? You were attacked, right? I wonder which universe had such courage. How dare them invade the universe where the Sacred race lives? Or perhaps... there is another battle between two Holy Beings in the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng had speculated that if the Sacred race had absolute strength, then they wouldn't have sent Maha out to negotiate in the first place.</p>

  <p>Instead, they would have directly pushed their entire race into the universe. And now the old man solidified his speculations even more.</p>

  <p>In the universe where the Sacred race resided, there was a True God who was tied down and couldn't leave. He had the responsibility to guard the universe first and foremost, so he was not able to come here in person.</p>

  <p>When they heard his words, the other Supreme Lords nodded their heads, suddenly hit with enlightenment.</p>

  <p>This old man had no real intent to kill Maha. At this moment, fighting them to death was neither wise nor prudent. The threat he had made to kill Maha was just a mere test.</p>

  <p>"You have no right to know," the voice said in a cutting tone. The giant hand slowly withdrew, volunteering no further information. It had left Maha and the nine Supreme Lords alone.</p>

  <p>Just now, the owner of this giant hand warned that should anyone dare to kill Maha, he would definitely retaliate by flattening the entire universe first. He said this not only because he was confident in his own strength, but also because he didn't consider the old man as his equal.</p>

  <p>Maha tilted his head and sneered at Supreme Lord of Original Sin, cold arrogance taking over his face. "Heard that? So why aren't you moving your garbage spear away from me?"</p>
