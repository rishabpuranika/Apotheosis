<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess was dragged away, it was Fuxi's turn.</p>

  <p>Fuxi walked towards the bottom of the fish hook and glanced at it. Then, he gingerly jumped up, held the fish hook in two fingers and then dragged it down a few times.</p>

  <p>Since he thought that he did not have to bite the fish hook, he wanted to give it a try.</p>

  <p>If the fish hook did not drag him up, then he would bite it.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he dragged the hook about four times, it suddenly pulled him up.</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone realized that they only needed to grab the fish hook.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and King Ieuan followed suit and grabbed the fish hooks, which dragged them upwards.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the three Eternal Realm Hunters also did the same.</p>

  <p>By the time most of them had gone up, only the Wing King and the men in black robes remained.</p>

  <p>The leader of the men in black robes glanced at the Wing King and said,</p>

  <p>"Let's go up too, but we have to leave eight people here to guard."</p>

  <p>"No, you all can go up together if you want. I will seal the cave," said the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The cave was the only place where they could retreat. Thus the Wing King had to make some arrangements.</p>

  <p>Although he believed in these members of the Night Being race, he still chose to rely on himself in critical situations.</p>

  <p>The leader of the men in black robes also knew that the Wing King and his group could not completely trust them. Thus, he just briskly said, "That's good. I'll go up with my race members!"</p>

  <p>Afterward, the men in black robes grabbed the fish hooks and swung for a while, before the hooks dragged them up one after another.</p>

  <p>After the fish hooks had pulled everyone up, the Wing King looked at the entrance of the cave and gently spread out his wings.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Streams of emerald liquid washed across his wings, which looked like soft, flowing jade. It dripped along his back and quickly sealed the cave's entire entrance.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>When the cave's entrance was completely sealed, the jade formed from the emerald liquid glowed green, and then froze.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade was immensely sturdy. Without the Regal Jade Civilization's unique methods, it was very difficult to break it.</p>

  <p>After the Wing King had finished, he stepped forward and bit the fish hook.</p>

  <p>He shook a few times and then the hook dragged him into the space above like the others.</p>

  <p>Above the cave was a vertical ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>The space around the passageway spiraled upwards, so people could not tell its size and distance.</p>

  <p>If they were in the chaos, the warriors would probably let go of the fish hooks and explore the space's secrets.</p>

  <p>However, everyone currently held on to the fish hooks.</p>

  <p>If they stopped, they might lose themselves in the space forever.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was the most miserable one among the crowd.</p>

  <p>She felt anxious to follow Zheng when she saw him get dragged up, so she just bit the fish hook like the Treacherous Being did.</p>

  <p>However, she found that Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others all held on to the fish hooks with their fingers.</p>

  <p>That was why she felt quite upset. As the fish hook dragged her up, she stared at Fuxi, who was not far below.</p>

  <p>In turn, Fuxi just smiled bitterly at her.</p>

  <p>He thought that he should bite the fish hook just like she did so that she would not feel so sad and embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the fish hook did not rise very fast. Then, the Snake Goddess slowly reached towards the corners of her mouth and tightly gripped the fish hook with her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh…"</p>

  <p>About an hour later, everyone saw the green light and blue light intertwine above them.</p>

  <p>The light floated around the space like waves as they gently and slowly moved up and down.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng rose slowly. As he crossed the blue and green waves, circles of blue and green ripples spread out.</p>

  <p>Then, everyone below him got surprised.</p>

  <p>It seemed that they were in some kind of special "water", but the "water" did not exist at all. It was just the scene above that caused such an illusion.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, it was the Snake Goddess's turn. Then Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others followed her.</p>

  <p>All of them also caused blue and green ripples when they passed through the waves as well, as if they were fish out of water.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a new scene appeared in front of everyone as soon as they passed through the blue and green ripples.</p>

  <p>All of them were in a big square pool, and around the pool stood many great bronze human statues.</p>

  <p>Each bronze statue sat cross-legged beside the square pool and held a long fishing rod in their hands. Of course, the fish hooks hung down from those fishing rods.</p>

  <p>The statues were quite massive in size, so the fishing rods were naturally the same.</p>

  <p>The rods measured about five hundred feet long, and each rod was so thick that two people could get their arms around.</p>

  <p>Zheng climbed onto the fishing rod and then jumped towards one of the statues. "Why are there so many human statues?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>After Zheng looked at them for a while, he said, "They are not the human statues, but the human spirits' statues."</p>

  <p>These bronze statues were very similar to those in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but the bronze statues by the pool had different appearances.</p>

  <p>Some of them had long hair, some were bald, some were old, some were sitting, and some were standing. They must have been famous and extraordinary in their world.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a moment and agreed with Zheng's speculation.</p>

  <p>The farthest place the 77th civilization had reached in the Three Purities Stage was the underground passage where they got trapped.</p>

  <p>As their group's leader, the Primeval Lord of Heaven naturally knew about it.</p>

  <p>So there was no way any human being could come to this place and build the big pool and the magnificent statues.</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility: it was the human spirits of the Four Spirits Sect that did such a thing.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng silently counted the statues beside the pool. "Two hundred bronze statues," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Their total number corresponds to the two hundred Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked. Just then, his eyes lit up as if in realization.</p>

  <p>"I think so." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told Zheng that the Treacherous Beings were very likely to be the souls of the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>Based on the number of bronze statues, it was highly possible for this assumption to be true.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being controlled Zheng's body to walk a certain distance, and stopped in front of a bronze statue at the corner of the pool.</p>

  <p>The bronze statue was a young man with curly hair. He rested on the ground and lazily held the fishing rod in his arms.</p>

  <p>When the Treacherous Being saw the bronze statue, its consciousness became a little level-headed. Then, it controlled Zheng to touch the statue's face, and at the same time, it let out a series of deep whines.</p>

  <p>This time, however, it wailed all of a sudden. Thus, the group of people who followed behind had no time to damage their hearing and had no choice but to listen to the sound.</p>

  <p>Yet, after the wails stopped, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others looked at each other in dismay.</p>

  <p>Although the Treacherous Being sounded as unpleasant as ever, it was completely within the range of their tolerance.</p>

  <p>Even the unpleasant aura that Zheng's body had emitted alleviated by multiple times.</p>

  <p>"Did the Treacherous Being become weak? I feel that the grinding howl did not make me very uncomfortable this time. Squeak!" said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"This Treacherous Being's will has weakened. The statue that rests on the ground is either the Treacherous Being itself or someone highly important to it," the leader of the men in black robes said from behind.</p>

  <p>"Its will became weaker?" Fuxi asked. He paused deep in thought, and an idea popped in his head. "Can you drive it out of Zheng's body now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There's no hurry," said the leader of the men in black robes. Then he added, "This is the Treacherous Being's place of origin. Its will will only get weaker and weaker, and by that time, I will be more confident to help Zheng get rid of it."</p>
