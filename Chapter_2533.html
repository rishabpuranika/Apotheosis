<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Riley and his group flew at full speed.</p>

  <p>"Hey Riley, can that brat even keep up with us?" one of them called out.</p>

  <p>"Whether or not he can is his problem," Riley answered smugly.</p>

  <p>Three wild bones were alright as a bribe, but not enough for him to go out of his way to take care of Zheng— Riley was planning on ditching him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Riley deliberately sped up and the other two followed him closely.</p>

  <p>"They think they can get rid of me? Ha!"</p>

  <p>All the while, Zheng had been following them at a moderate speed.</p>

  <p>When the three sped up, the corners of Zheng's mouth quirked up in amusement as he sped up after them.</p>

  <p>After taking a quick glance at Zheng behind him, Riley was surprised at what he found.</p>

  <p>The young man was still steadily following them from about a hundred feet— he didn't even fall behind.</p>

  <p>"Riley, he's not slow."</p>

  <p>"Seems like he has recently started to cultivate the Wild God system?"</p>

  <p>"I think he has cultivated the True God system. He has a high cultivation base, too. It's pretty strange."</p>

  <p>The two behind Riley discussed.</p>

  <p>But Riley merely laughed and said, "It doesn't matter what he has cultivated. You two, keep up!"</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power flashed from Riley's body, strengthening his momentum remarkably. All of a sudden, he shot forward even faster.</p>

  <p>The two behind him glanced at each other. All they could do was stimulate their own Wild God Power. If they wanted to follow Riley, they had no choice but to go all out.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained indifferent at the sight of the scene before him.</p>

  <p>With his chaotic energy in his inner world slightly revolving, he easily kept up with the group.</p>

  <p>After five minutes had passed, Riley was far in the lead, assuming that he had already gotten rid of Zheng. But when he turned to check, his eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>The guy was still following close behind them, maintaining the hundred-foot distance without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>"What a strange guy…" Still, Riley refused to give up and continued moving forward at high speed.</p>

  <p>"Slow down, Riley!"</p>

  <p>"We can't keep up with you!"</p>

  <p>The other two Wild Gods couldn't stand flying at such a high speed for too long. Even though their bodies were strengthened by the Wild God Power, making them far stronger than other people, their cultivation bases were still weaker than Riley's. After a while of going at top speed, they had maxed out their Wild God Power and needed to stop for a breather.</p>

  <p>But Riley turned a deaf ear to his men, determined to get rid of Zheng.</p>

  <p>He released even stronger Wild God Power, raising his speed by another thirty percent— such was his limit.</p>

  <p>Unable to keep up, the other two gave up altogether.</p>

  <p>Seeing Riley shoot forward so far away, Zheng merely chuckled. His body was light as a swallow, speeding away in the wind. He easily sped up by thirty percent as well.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng passed Riley's men.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The strong wind Zheng triggered was like a slap in the two guys' faces.</p>

  <p>They could only remain where they were and stare at him, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"How could he follow Riley at full speed?"</p>

  <p>"Is someone who cultivates the True God system really that powerful?"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Wild Gods, the practice of the True God system was heresy. They had never seen such a strong True God, so Zheng's speed had completely taken them off guard.</p>

  <p>After about fifteen minutes of this chase, Riley himself couldn't stand it any longer.</p>

  <p>When he looked back, he found Zheng still hanging behind him from about a hundred feet. He looked absolutely calm and composed, not tired at all!</p>

  <p>At this point, Riley had reached his absolute limit. He realized that it was impossible to fully get rid of Zheng, so all he could do was slow down.</p>

  <p>After that spectacle, Riley came to truly admire Zheng. The guy was a mere newbie Wild God in his eyes, but his performance was nothing short of unfathomable.</p>

  <p>On the way north, Zheng spotted a vast area of grayish-brown soil.</p>

  <p>He was aware that there was a considerable amount of area at the bottom of chaos covered by bones and skeletons. All such areas were referred to as the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>It was no place to live in. Only people from the lowest level of society, such as the Iron Tribe, would live on the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness to make a living out of collecting wild bones.</p>

  <p>Many cities lay outside the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>And Riley was one of the stewards of the Falcon Caravan of the Sand Core City.</p>

  <p>Zelda instructed Zheng to never ask the Falcon Caravan to auction the blood wild bone for him.</p>

  <p>This Falcon Caravan was a small trade group that held no real credibility.</p>

  <p>If Zheng directly just pulled out the blood wild bone, he would only be attracting an endless pursuit of it.</p>

  <p>According to Zelda, Zheng was to gain qualification for the auction through Riley only.</p>

  <p>After nearly a day and a half, a huge crater suddenly appeared before Zheng's eyes. It was made up of a great amount of quicksand with a city sitting in the very center.</p>

  <p>"No wonder it's called Sand Core City..." Zheng murmured as he gazed down at the city.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the crater's center, Riley led them straight to the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, just follow me," Riley ordered indifferently.</p>

  <p>Though the Sand Core City was a remote one, it was still under strict management— no one was allowed to fly into its territory. All arrivals had to land on the ground, subject to inspection by the guards at the entrance.</p>

  <p>When Riley and his two men showed their tokens, the guards let them in.</p>

  <p>But when Zheng followed, one of the guards thrust out his long spear to Zheng's chest. "Stop!"</p>

  <p>"He's a guest of our Falcon Caravan," Riley said, handing another light-green token to Zheng. Every warrior who entered the city required a special token. With that in hand, the guard stepped back and let Zheng pass.</p>

  <p>Zheng then understood why Zelda had him follow Riley into the city. He couldn't have gotten in there on his own without stirring much trouble.</p>

  <p>Upon entering the city, Riley led Zheng straight to his base.</p>

  <p>After Riley talked to some of the people, an old man wearing a silk kerchief stepped out.</p>

  <p>He looked Zheng up and down before asking, "Young man, do you have something you want to entrust us to auction?"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes fell on Zheng. They knew that Zheng must have had something highly valuable, but neither he nor Zelda revealed anything.</p>

  <p>"This is what I want to auction," Zheng said, pulling out a large piece of wild bone.</p>

  <p>It was black all over and as big as an adult's fist.</p>

  <p>Both Riley and the old man were surprised at the sight.</p>

  <p>Pure black blood wild bones were considered highly precious because of the various types of blood within them— they all ranked very high on the List of Blood Lineage. One of them was called the Heavenly Core Blood, ranking 19th; another was the Nether Luminous Blood, ranking 11th. Blood wild bones containing such kinds of blood held amazingly high value.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, many people would flock to it at the auction.</p>
