<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3137 The Sword Texture Technique </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Trish had an idea of how persistent the warriors who had reached the Other Shore were.</p>

  <p>Maybe someone like Zheng was not suitable to stay in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Similar to Zheng, there were people in the past who made the wrong choice and were later dismissed.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng was asked to leave, he had other options to choose from. He could either move to the Killing Sword Sect or the Unique Array Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Compared to him, Trish and Carrie would have to face grave consequences.</p>

  <p>They would be asked to leave the mountain, and wouldn't be allowed to stay in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>If other servant girls were in the same position as them, they might just give up their jobs and leave. However, Carrie only widened her eyes and asked,</p>

  <p>"So how do we stop Mr. Luo from cultivating? When he sets up an enchanted barrier, we won't be able to enter his room..."</p>

  <p>"We should figure out a way," said Trish while nodding her head.</p>

  <p>The second day, it was a bright and sunny morning. White fluffy clouds that looked like cotton candy drifted across the sky.</p>

  <p>Inside one of the rooms on the upper floor of the building, there was a wooden slab cut out in the shape of a square, a stone brick, and a long sword in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The textures of everything in the world exist...</p>

  <p>One can't see them all because they do not observe them carefully enough.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, even I can find the textures on the whole Source World when I reach the top level of the Sword Texture Technique. I should be able to chop the Source World in half and destroy it with one sword strike...</p>

  <p>This..."</p>

  <p>In the past few days, Zheng had developed a deep understanding of the Sword Texture Technique and gradually become familiar with it.</p>

  <p>However, he was at a loss for words when he read the postscript of the Sword Texture Technique. It was a bit of a stretch to describe that one could cut open the Source World in half with one sword strike.</p>

  <p>"I should disperse the truth aura, and hold my breath while I observe it..."</p>

  <p>Casually, Zheng began to release his truth aura, and it slowly surrounded him from all sides.</p>

  <p>When the truth aura started dispersing to a certain extent, he gathered it by following the methods of the Sword Texture Technique and pushed it towards the square wood in front of him.</p>

  <p>Then he kept his eyes wide open and stared at the slab of wood.</p>

  <p>Soon, he witnessed a texture form on the surface of it.</p>

  <p>"Can I break it if I cut it along its texture?"</p>

  <p>Instinctively, Zheng picked up the long sword and proceeded to cut along the texture on the surface of the wood.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>With a swift move, the slab got cut in half.</p>

  <p>Looking at the broken symmetrical pieces of the wood, Zheng pursed his lips in disappointment.</p>

  <p>He could easily slice the wooden slab into two pieces with even his soul power, let alone a sword.</p>

  <p>The Sword Texture Technique seemed to be so formidable. However, the result still disappointed Zheng. With the amount of effort he put in, he expected more.</p>

  <p>But, soon after, when the square wood fell to the ground, something amazing happened. The surface of both pieces appeared to have many broken lines on them.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The two pieces of wood Zheng split earlier further crumbled down into many minuscule bits until they were reduced to dust.</p>

  <p>Watching this scene, Zheng couldn't help but feel stunned.</p>

  <p>With only one strike, he had subdued a sturdy slab of wood and turned it into powder.</p>

  <p>Feeling inspired, he now switched his attention to the stone brick.</p>

  <p>Once again, he released his aura. Carefully, he ran his gaze on the complicated textures of the stone brick. He sought out three different textures that gathered at one place to form a dot.</p>

  <p>This time, he wanted to be creative. With a swift wave of his hand, he threw the sword aside. And instead, he poked at the dot using his finger.</p>

  <p>Making sure he didn't break the stone brick, he tapped it gently.</p>

  <p>However, just as his finger made contact with the area, the sound of a crack resounded in the room. As a result, the stone brick had crumbled to dust.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough!"</p>

  <p>Even more enthusiastic than before, Zheng turned his concentration to the last object.</p>

  <p>This long sword had been brought from the divine land. Although it was not as good as the primary Profound Blood Treasure, its quality was not something to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Applying the same method as before, Zheng stared at the object and could feel that his aura surrounded it. However, this time, he was unable to detect any textures on the sword.</p>

  <p>After all, the Sword Texture Technique was a supreme swordsmanship manual, it was impossible to master it in one go.</p>

  <p>But still, Zheng was a persistent man, and he continued to gaze at it long and hard. Simultaneously, he kept releasing his truth aura, but he could only vaguely make out the textures on the sword.</p>

  <p>"As I have expected, it's really difficult to detect the sword textures with the naked eye..."</p>

  <p>This was partly the reason why Zheng gave up learning the Sword Texture Technique before. The technique was so complicated that it was hard for him to make out the textures of his opponents who were on the same cultivation level as him. At this point, it could be counted as useless theurgy, which could only be used to deal with ordinary things.</p>

  <p>However, he had picked it up again because this time, he had the Eye of Will to rely on.</p>

  <p>He raised his right eyebrow, and a ray of white light began to flash across his pupil.</p>

  <p>It was as if the world around him had changed. Anything he laid his right eye on seemed to be as clear as crystal.</p>

  <p>The sword textures that once seemed blur to him were now as clear as day!</p>

  <p>"There, in the middle of the blade..."</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out his hand and sliced at the middle of the sword with his finger.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to exert much pressure, he gently tapped at it. Even so, the middle part of the sword immediately disintegrated into tiny particles of metal, and the hilt had turned into a pile of wood chips.</p>

  <p>"Hoo!"</p>

  <p>Subconsciously his eyes widened at the sight as he imagined the damage this technique could do to a living creature.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to consolidate his skill, the enchanted barrier he placed suddenly let out a clap of thunder. A figure bounced off from the impact, and at the same time, he heard a miserable scream of a woman.</p>

  <p>Taken by surprise, Zheng hurriedly waved his hands to remove the enchanted barrier. As he turned his gaze towards the woman, he saw Trish lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you to not enter my room without my permission?" Zheng said as he shook his head in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Trish was slightly injured after she ricocheted from getting in contact with it. Wearing light make-up, she took advantage of the moment and deliberately lifted the hemline of her dress. She looked pitiful as she exposed her legs to him in an attempt to seduce him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng just ignored that. Instead, he helped her recover from her wounds. As he flicked his fingers, a ray of green light began to cloak her, and the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way healed her.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng turned around to go back to his cultivation, Trish said, "I thought since you cultivated every day, you should get some nourishment to replenish your energy, so I cooked some soup for you... Now it seems that I may have to bring another jar of soup for you."</p>

  <p>The jar of soup now was on the ground with all its contents spilled over, making the fragrance of soup diffuse around the room.</p>

  <p>Looking at the soup jar, Zheng just shook his head and said, "That's fine. You don't have to. I haven't eaten food for many years."</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>Before Trish could finish, Zheng had already returned to his cultivation. With a wave of his hands, the enchanted barrier enveloped the room once more.</p>

  <p>Trish stomped her foot to the ground and left with a sullen expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"Trish, how did it go?" Carrie couldn't help but ask, even though she had guessed what had happened upon seeing Trish's expression.</p>

  <p>"He is such an aloof guy. Unfortunately, we can't explain anything to him..."</p>

  <p>Trish said as she gritted her teeth.</p>

  <p>This was the rule of the Flow Sword Sect. The servant girls were not allowed to tell others about the secrets of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>"Once the Flow Tower is repaired, and Mr. Luo is unable to pass the test, I'm afraid we will immediately be asked to leave as well. We only have a month left," Carrie said with low spirits.</p>

  <p>"I will not give up!" Trish said while clenching her fists furiously.</p>

  <p>In the next few days, Trish and Carrie made several attempts to stop Zheng from cultivating.</p>

  <p>One day, Carrie had carried her zither to the second floor where he was training. She was proficient in music. But when she played it, Zheng had cast a sound-proof enchanted barrier to isolate the sound.</p>

  <p>Another day, when Zheng came out of his room, Trish asked him to take a look at her painting and give her feedback. But Zheng turned her down with the excuse that he was not an expert when it came to paintings.</p>

  <p>And one day...</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Trish and Carrie, Zheng was a warrior who only focused on his cultivation and never cared for much else. He was not suitable to stay in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>
