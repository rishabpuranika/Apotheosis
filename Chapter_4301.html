<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Inside the Burial Land, the cloud of Probability Extreme Form continued to stretch over the surface, covering it completely.</p>

  <p>The figures of the downgrader came into sight and then left over and over again.</p>

  <p>In less than a minute, tens of billions of avatars appeared, only to disappear, leaving without a trace. The number was meaningless when it came to infinity.</p>

  <p>Over a thousand Luo Zheng's avatars in the cloud were killed. His real body was sliced into smaller parts and scattered around the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Luo Zheng's ancestry-level bloodline, consciousness, and Extreme Form energies were still alive, pushing through the tragedy that had just happened.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With all that was left of his power and strength, Luo Zheng called his scattered body parts to come together and waited as it took shape.</p>

  <p>However, before he could regain his balance, an uncountable number of the downgrader's avatars came to surround him.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the downgrader's avatars said, launching palm strikes towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew palm strikes were not very great in power. They weren't even strong enough to kill an Eternal Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>What worried him was the number of avatars aiming the strikes at him at the same time. Enduring one strike was possible, but to endure tens of billions of strikes at the same time was a different ball game. For all he knew, they could have the power to burn him into ashes in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>'In the primitive land, I would not die, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself. Even if his original body was broken, it would still remain inside the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as his parts began to morph into his original body, what was always waiting for him were the downgrader's avatars, ready to attack him with great intensity.</p>

  <p>Five times.</p>

  <p>Ten times.</p>

  <p>Fifty times.</p>

  <p>One hundred times.</p>

  <p>He had barely stitched his body parts back together, and the avatars were already breaking it down. It would be impossible for him to fight back.</p>

  <p>"You're becoming desperate, Luo Zheng. I can feel it," the downgrader said. "I was generous enough to give you every chance to surrender, but you're too hard-headed. You still refused. Now, there's no time for regret. You'd better use the only time you have left to say goodbye to this world!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At the foot of a mountain reaching the heavens, Luo Zheng's body continued to condense.</p>

  <p>However, just as his body began to regain shape, the downgrader's avatars appeared before him again. In a split-second, the giant mountain and Luo Zheng were smashed into fine powder.</p>

  <p>Regardless, Luo Zheng wasn't ready to quit. He quickly began to think of other places where he could continue condensing into his original form.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was doing this, he heard a voice call to him. It was the voice of the ancestry-level bloodline. "Luo Zheng, stop," it pleaded, sounding very concerned.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't do useless things," the ancestry-level bloodline replied, which irritated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What do you even mean? Are you saying I shouldn't do anything about this?" Luo Zheng asked with anger present in his voice.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had been face-to-face with a large number of strong and powerful opponents. For the first time in his life, he had felt so weak.</p>

  <p>As the Troubled Creatures were inching closer and closer to the Li Shan mountain, he knew everything would be destroyed. Everything he had done was going to be for nothing. The thought that he couldn't even do anything about it frustrated him greatly.</p>

  <p>The opponent he was facing now was just too powerful to be defeated.</p>

  <p>He was busy in his thoughts when the ancestry-level bloodline began to speak again, catching his attention. "I've found Clarence's memories," it said.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, not being sure if he had heard right.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Ring Staff was brought back, the ancestry-level bloodline was certain its memories were stored in the crystal, but it had never been able to understand the crystal.</p>

  <p>Just a few moments back, Luo Zheng's physical body had been crushed into pieces by the downgrader. His body parts, as well as the crystal, merged into the Burial Land. Then, unexpectedly, the memories inside the crystal flowed out.</p>

  <p>"You shall inherit Clarence's memories," the ancestry-level bloodline said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng asked, furrowing his brows in confusion.</p>

  <p>"I'm just a wisp of intelligence from the ancestry-level bloodline. I'm not a part of Clarence. You're more suitable for this," it replied.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could ask more questions or refuse, he felt a sharp pain from the back of his brain. "Argh!" he screamed in pain. All of a sudden, endless memories came flooding in, reaching even the deepest parts of his soul.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>After the short, sharp pain was gone, things returned to normal.</p>

  <p>He was back in his own consciousness again. After this, he noticed that in front of him lay a pure, blank space.</p>

  <p>There was absolutely nothing in it, but for some reason, it didn't make him feel empty. Ironically, it gave him a sense of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask, taking in his new environment.</p>

  <p>"You're in the perfect land," an unfamiliar voice answered.</p>

  <p>"The perfect land? But there is nothing in here. How can this be perfect?" he asked, confused but curious.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the world that was absolutely perfect, especially considering that everyone had a different definition of perfection. What was perfect for one person could be imperfect to another.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Zheng spoke, his voice caused countless ripples to appear in the space.</p>

  <p>The ripples began to fill the space, and suddenly, the area began to transform. The sky became pure blue. Courtyard walls rose from the ground which was paved with cyan-colored bricks. A group of laughing children ran along the corridor, followed by the adults scolding them for running.</p>

  <p>The walls looked similar to those of the fairy palace but even more like those of the Luo Clan's old mansion.</p>

  <p>The laughing children were very much like younger versions of Yudie, Margaret, and the others.</p>

  <p>Standing in the courtyard, Luo Zheng felt a sense of peace and contentment in his heart.</p>

  <p>He had no idea how he managed to do it, especially so easily, but he was very happy to have built such a world.</p>

  <p>"This is your perfect land. The space you saw just now is my perfect land," the voice said.</p>

  <p>"Yes! A world that corresponds to all perfection," Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You're right," the voice said, becoming low. "But everything has been destroyed."</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The blue sky was overcast with dark, grey clouds. The courtyards collapsed one after another like dominoes. The brick road was blown away by the strong wind, and the children fell to the ground, covered in their own blood. Darkness fell upon the land, devouring it completely.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng knew what he was seeing was not real, he could not help the sinking feeling in his heart. He was unable to suppress his anger, questioning the voice. "Why did you destroy this world?" he screamed.</p>

  <p>"I destroyed it because of him," the voice said.</p>

  <p>"Because of whom?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I call him Mastema, but I believe you know him as the downgrader," the voice answered.</p>

  <p>"If this was your perfect land, why was Mastema here?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"He was a wisp of my consciousness. I created him," the voice replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began to feel his blood boil even more. "Then why did you create him?" he said, raising his voice.</p>

  <p>"At that time, I thought the only perfect world was an imperfect one. This was why I created Mastema. He was necessary for breaking the perfection I created, but I didn't expect things to reach a point that I couldn't handle anymore. I didn't plan for him to be so powerful."</p>

  <p>After the voice said this, a black dot appeared and began to expand. It expanded like a bubble, bigger and bigger until eventually, it popped.</p>

  <p>It broke into four pieces, which were all connected, forming a giant trapezoid.</p>

  <p>'This should be the Boundless Shock World, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had told him before what happened in the Levitation Tower.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he had a general understanding of the worlds of all grades. 'The perfect land I was just in must be the Boundless Perfect World. Geoffrey has never been there before, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The trapezoid continued to collapse, turning into rectangular pieces. When the pieces gathered together again, it turned into an even larger trapezoid.</p>

  <p>This was the Boundless Secondary World. When this collapsed, the Boundless Void World appeared.</p>

  <p>And when this collapsed, another world came to view.</p>

  <p>A total of nine worlds appeared and collapsed. In the end, the Stellar World appeared, specifically the Deep Space. Most of its parts had collapsed.</p>

  <p>"I realized too late that Mastema would destroy everything. I did my best to chase him down and kill him. However, from the twelfth-grade world to the fifth-grade world, I failed completely," the voice said, sad and full of remorse.</p>

  <p>It was much easier to destroy than to create. The downgrader wouldn't stop just like that, especially when he had already begun the downgrade.</p>
