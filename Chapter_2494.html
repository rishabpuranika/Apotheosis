  <p>
</p>

  <p>Several figures rushed out from the enormous hole at the top of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The group was led by Tyrone, Ellis, and some others.</p>

  <p>Because of Duke, they had all suffered major injuries.</p>

  <p>But before Edmond appeared, they all scattered like roaches and managed to escape the debate venue by sheer luck.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>As soon as they fled from the hole, they landed on the surface of the Sunrest Tree, all of them panting with exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"I thought I was going to die."</p>

  <p>"Duke wanted to get himself killed. Fine, but he shouldn't have all of us die with him!"</p>

  <p>"Hmph! I'm sure he's already turned to dust."</p>

  <p>Now, Duke had replaced Luo Zheng as the man the top-rank True Gods hated the most.</p>

  <p>After almost getting killed because of Duke, they managed to save their own lives, giving them a sense of narrow escape.</p>

  <p>After taking a good rest at the edge of the hole, they flew towards the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>Soon after they left, Reinhard emerged from the hole with ten disciples of the Sword Clan behind him, the soybean-eyed guy and Enoch.</p>

  <p>"We're back!"</p>

  <p>After finally leaving the debate venue, the crowd wore huge smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>While the Sword Clan lost one of their members, they at least got to help Luo Zheng and Yan meet their goal. Their trip to the debate venue was a nearly perfect experience in hindsight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>These people also shot toward the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>In the hall?</p>

  <p>Marsh, Gibson, and Harold all looked quite relaxed.</p>

  <p>They already knew the result, after all.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't too sure what Luo Zheng and Yan would encounter with Li Luoshui, they just assumed that she wouldn't do anything to harm her own children.</p>

  <p>However?</p>

  <p>Both Troy and Rachelle looked pissed off.</p>

  <p>"I heard that the Sword Clan has some kind of technique that allows you to see the situation within the Sunrest Tree. You should already know what happened in the debate venue," Rachelle pressed.</p>

  <p>But Marsh only grinned and said, "I have no time to watch the younger generation's movements. They all have to rely on their own skills to succeed. The one who dared to play a trick has already met his doom!"</p>

  <p>Troy's eyes twitched as he heard this.</p>

  <p>Marsh was suggesting that the Sword Clan had already known the Dongfang Clan's plot. Perhaps they had seen the fiend themselves.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Troy was most worried about Duke not being able to enter the debate venue. If he died before getting there, all the Dongfang Clan's preparations would have been for naught, but it was unlikely.</p>

  <p>Since Duke had entered the venue and successfully summoned the fiend, the top-rank True Gods would undoubtedly perish, Troy figured.</p>

  <p>But Harold's and Marsh's relaxed demeanor had Troy puzzled? did the top-rank True Gods actually defeat the fiend and pass the debate venue?</p>

  <p>It was virtually impossible!</p>

  <p>Not willing to wait any longer, he led the other consummate True Gods of the alliance of powerful clans to come here to ask about the situation.</p>

  <p>But Marsh didn't give any direct answers, of course.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a sudden roar was heard from outside the door.</p>

  <p>People started trickling in from the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Tyrone!" With her sharp eyes, Rachelle spotted Tyrone, badly injured.</p>

  <p>"Those are serious wounds, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>Pale and in pain, Tyrone stared at Troy with a look of grievance.</p>

  <p>Noticing Harold's and the Sword Clan members' presence, Tyrone knew to be sensible about the situation. Instead of complaining about Duke and the Dongfang Clan, he said in a low voice, "I almost lost my life because of Duke!"</p>

  <p>"How did he get you into trouble?" Troy asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Forget it," Tyrone said, waving his hand. "I won't hold him accountable.</p>

  <p>He won't come back anyway."</p>

  <p>"Duke is stronger than you. Since you have come back, he must've survived. Where is he?" Troy asked further, needing to know what really happened in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"We faced a fiend," Tyrone said, rolling his eyes and pouting.</p>

  <p>The words had Troy somewhat relieved, but he feigned surprise in front of the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan. "A fiend? Then the others must have?"</p>

  <p>"They're dead!" Tyrone interrupted him impatiently.</p>

  <p>The answer put a pleased glint in Troy's eyes. No matter what happened in the Sunrest Tree, so long as the others were all gone, he could consider his goal achieved.</p>

  <p>He cared nothing about the process, after all.</p>

  <p>But he didn't know that Tyrone's words were practically nonsensical? when they saw the fiend, they all ran away, after all. They had no clue what really went down.</p>

  <p>Harold and his group, however, had witnessed the whole thing. When they saw Troy pretend, they merely sneered and kept quiet.</p>

  <p>Soon after Tyrone and his companions returned, another group of people, including Reinhard, appeared at the door.</p>

  <p>Tyrone and Ellis seemed shocked out of their minds, as though they had seen real ghosts.</p>

  <p>"You? You also ran away?" Tyrone stammered as he asked.</p>

  <p>He and his companions had wrongly assumed that they were the only survivors? it was quite a slap to the face to find out that most of the members of the Sword Clan had managed to return as well.</p>

  <p>Sensing the atmosphere in the hall, Reinhard offered a light smile. "We didn't run away."</p>

  <p>But Tyrone wasn't convinced and coldly asked, "Oh really? You didn't run away? Tell me, then, how you could've possibly survived against that fiend?"</p>

  <p>"It's quite simple, really," Reinhard replied, still smiling.</p>

  <p>The same mysterious smile appeared on the faces of Enoch and the other Sword Clan members.</p>

  <p>"How did you make it?" Tyrone looked at Reinhard hesitantly as he asked.</p>

  <p>Even consummate True Gods were staring at Reinhard anxiously, eager to hear his answer.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't care to hear how Reinhard survived, but they wanted to find out whether or not someone had obtained the debate's inheritance.</p>

  <p>"Kill that fiend." Reinhard laughed.</p>

  <p>Tyrone's expression suddenly changed at this news.</p>

  <p>It brought a frown to Troy's face as well. "You killed the fiend? How?</p>

  <p>You're all merely top-rank True Gods."</p>

  <p>Because the two Holy Beings of the Sword Clan were there, Reinhard wasn't the least bit afraid of Troy. He merely shrugged in response before leading the disciples of the Sword Clan up to the hall. As he walked, he said, "It wasn't us who killed the fiend, but he died indeed. Duke stirred up trouble and got himself killed. Believe it or not."</p>

  <p>To this, the faces of Troy, Rachelle, Shahn, and Walton all grew dark.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to tell if Reinhard was telling the truth or not. They could only exchange looks and read each other's eyes, assessing their worries.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his sister hadn't shown up yet, after all? the rest were hoping that the two would perish in the debate venue so that they wouldn't have to deal with the pair ever again.</p>

  <p>But barely five minutes passed when?</p>

  <p>Another two figures appeared at the door of the hall? they were none other than Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>After spending much time in the deep well, with Harper's help, they were covered in a layer of green liquid, allowing them to fly all the way up the Sunrest Tree. Because of this, they didn't lag too far behind Reinhard and the others.</p>
