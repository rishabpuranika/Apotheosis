<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Countless warriors were moving through the crisscrossing spiderweb-like lines in the sky.</p>

  <p>These warriors were certainly not as timid as the ordinary mortals below.</p>

  <p>The dispute between Zheng and the others aroused their interest. Thus, they all stopped to watch from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng call the Soul Sea Realm warriors as scum and dare them to challenge him together, all the onlookers were thrilled as they anticipated to see a good show. They were all wondering why the guy at the Life and Death Realm was so arrogant.</p>

  <p>However, they knew that arrogance should come from power. He was undoubtedly courting his death if he didn't have the strength to save himself.</p>

  <p>"Well, is it your strong body that you are bragging about, thus, you're this arrogant? Are you even sure that you want us to fight you together?</p>

  <p>You are thinking too highly of yourself! I can teach you a good lesson by myself, you brat!" A long-haired youth walked out from that group of warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled slightly as he raised the long sword in his hand. He was ready to accept the challenge.</p>

  <p>However, the two hall leaders wouldn't let this ruckus happen since it was their duty to escort Zheng to the Holy City. Therefore, it was also their task to stop this fight even if Zheng was more than fit to fight.</p>

  <p>Master He moved a step forward and said to the young warriors, "I'm sorry but we still have urgent matters to attend to. We can't accept your challenge now and I hope that you guys know when enough is enough."</p>

  <p>However, the long-haired youth paid no heed to Master He's words and even scolded him. "Enough is enough? Who do you think you are? How dare you stop us?"</p>

  <p>Immediately, Master He's face darkened in anger.</p>

  <p>There were many experts in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Besides several heads of the sacred place, about a hundred elders, and other important members, the leaders of the thirty-six halls like him were still honored higher than anyone else.</p>

  <p>In other words, Master He and Master Shen were ranked among the top 200 in this tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Master He's cultivation base was only a little below to those world lords. Thus, he was extremely annoyed at being scolded by a merely 20-year-old junior.</p>

  <p>Master He sneered coldly, "Young man, regardless of who your parents are, you must be careful not to make troubles outside!" Pondering about the arrogance that this group of warriors was displaying, Master He guessed that they must have a strong background. Therefore, he tried to restrain his anger. He would have crushed them into ashes with just a wave of his hand if they were other ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>"So what if I make some troubles here?" the long-haired youth snorted.</p>

  <p>He could obviously sense the powerful strength of the two hall leaders but he just didn't pay it any attention.</p>

  <p>"If you don't know how to behave yourself then I might as well teach you a lesson in your parents' place!" Master He said angrily. This bunch of reckless boys was really getting on his nerves.</p>

  <p>The long-haired teenager smiled and said, "My grandfather is Elder Hershel of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Do you want to teach me a lesson? Are you even qualified to do so?"</p>

  <p>The two masters' faces hardened upon hearing Elder Hershel's name.</p>

  <p>They now understood why the boy dared to act as such.</p>

  <p>Since those young warriors dared to be so arrogant in the Holy City, their background shouldn't be underestimated. Otherwise, they should have already been punished.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing how the two masters' expressions changed because of those words, the group of young warriors became even more arrogant.</p>

  <p>The long-haired youth even dared to sneer and ask, "Sir, don't you think that you should ponder whether you have the right to teach me a lesson before saying that?"</p>

  <p>Master He looked very embarrassed as he was questioned by the youth.</p>

  <p>Elder Hershel was an extremely powerful elder in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. He had a short temper and was very unprincipled when it came to protecting his descendants. Many hall leaders had learned that to their cost. Thus, both Master Shen and Master He didn't want to provoke that old guy.</p>

  <p>The group of young warriors noticed that the two hall leaders had lost their auras of authority and began to scold them aggressively.</p>

  <p>"Do you have the qualification? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Say it out loud!"</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are? Yes, your cultivation base is higher than ours, but it doesn't mean that you are superior to us!"</p>

  <p>The long-haired youth also took a step forward and asked, "Tell me now.</p>

  <p>How do you want to teach me a lesson?"</p>

  <p>"I... You..." Master He stammered. He was surely more powerful than this youth if they were to talk about cultivation. However, he was still forced to step back due to his background.</p>

  <p>"Tell me! Aren't you a hall leader or a vice hall leader? Well, it's true that you are the head of your land but then, remember that you are nothing here in the Holy City!" said the long-haired youth as he continued to draw near.</p>

  <p>Just as Master He took another step back, a figure suddenly flashed past him.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng, who traveled through space and dashed forward. At the same time, the chaotic energy within his body produced an extremely strong power of the Wind Law. As he applied the Cloud-chasing Skill, he swiftly approached the long-haired youth and slapped his face.</p>

  <p>Surely, his slap wasn't that easy to bear.</p>

  <p>Even if it landed on a ferocious beast with a tough body, the beast would probably not be able to withstand the power of the slap.</p>

  <p>The long-haired youth ended up spinning like a top because of Zheng's powerful strength.</p>

  <p>After he finally managed to dispel the force of Zheng's slap and stood on his feet, one side of his face was already red and swollen. The finger marks on his face also swelled up as if they were embedded in his skin.</p>

  <p>Zheng brandished his sword and sneered coldly, "I said that you're scum and that was true. You see, you are nothing without using your grandfather's name!"</p>

  <p>"You brat!" The long-haired youth was immediately enraged. His humiliation completely numbed the pain on his face. "I will kill you!" he spat.</p>

  <p>"Kill this brat!"</p>

  <p>"Kill him! I will drop his body in the dirtiest place in the Holy City!"</p>

  <p>Those young warriors all rushed towards Zheng together.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng also prepared to accept the challenge. Although he acted extremely arrogant, he decided not to kill anyone in this battle.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the two hall leaders with profound cultivations would not let the battle happen.</p>

  <p>Master Shen extended a finger and pointed at them as he said, "Freeze!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A stream of power that contained the Time Law spread out, enveloping those young warriors.</p>

  <p>He nodded towards Master He and grabbed Zheng's arm. After that, Master He performed his Grand Teleportation technique as he grabbed Zheng and Master Shen before they three disappeared into a white spiral of light and left that place.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique could only be used after grasping high layers of Space Law. It was actually something similar to Zheng's traveling skill through space. The only difference was that Zheng's skill could only move him a few dozen feet away. Even after two years of cultivation and comprehending more of the Space Law, Zheng could only move a distance of three to four hundred feet at most.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique, however, could easily cross several hundred miles. It was a life-saving measure for warriors who comprehended the Space Law. And when it was cultivated to an extremely high level, the Grand Teleportation technique could cross an unimaginable distance, allowing the user to teleport between different supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>After they three disappeared, the effect of the Time Law slowly vanished and those young warriors regained their moving abilities. There was a grim expression on each of their faces as none of them could accept their great loss!</p>

  <p>"As long as you are still in the Holy City, you will never be able to escape from me!" The long-haired youth grinned fiendishly as he stuffed a pill into his mouth. It was an expensive eighth-grade pill.</p>

  <p>Regular warriors wouldn't want to use such an expensive pill unless they were already at the verge of death. Although Zheng's slap made him look utterly embarrassing, it was still far less than necessary for him to take that pill. However, the finger marks on his face were a great shame to him. Thus, he wanted them to disappear as soon as possible and consumed the precious pill.</p>

  <p>The effect of the medicinal pill was astonishing. The finger prints left by Zheng's palm began to visibly fade away not even a minute after he swallowed it.</p>

  <p>However, even though the palm print on his face had disappeared, his heart was far from being at peace!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After using the Grand Teleportation technique, Zheng and the two hall leaders reappeared in another corner of the Holy City.</p>

  <p>Master He sighed and said, "Forget it. Let's continue on our way now."</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the worry on Master He's face, he said, "Master He, why do you fear those brats? They should've been taught a good lesson!"</p>

  <p>Master He didn't say anything to answer him. Instead, Master Shen interrupted, "Zheng, you don't know this. Although we thirty-six halls are impressive in others' eyes, we're nothing compared with the Holy City.</p>

  <p>Those young warriors have a strong background and I'm afraid that they might not let you go easily."</p>
