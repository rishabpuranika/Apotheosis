<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3388 Flying Against The Hurricane </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the gate of the Chaotic Source World, Phoenix sat in a corner, meditating with eyes closed. After she sensed Lesly's and Brylee's deaths, her eyes shot open.</p>

  <p>In her fury, she emanated wave after wave of malicious aura. Everyone around her could tangibly feel her anger.</p>

  <p>Beside her sat three other demon women. They too were shocked when they found out about the deaths of their kin.</p>

  <p>"Lesly and Brylee were killed at the same time?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"How could that happen?"</p>

  <p>The demon women communicated with each other using life vitality, their faces full of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's expression darkened.</p>

  <p>The demon women from the Divine Lair were connected by blood. No matter how far they were from each other, they could sense each other's deaths.</p>

  <p>They could also sense it if Feng Ge and Concubine Yan died.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Phoenix?" a leader of the Divine Farmer race asked through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Lesly and Brylee are dead," Phoenix answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>"No way!" the leader exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Bearing race and the New Moon race frowned collectively.</p>

  <p>"As of right now, no one has entered the core area. The chances of them dying outside are slim," the old man from the Bearing race said.</p>

  <p>When everyone had entered the Chaotic Source World, a huge magic array appeared in front of the leaders. The array produced a huge mirror which reflected the core area of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>However, anything outside the core area wasn't covered; they couldn't monitor what was happening outside.</p>

  <p>According to the old man from the Bearing race, no one had stepped into the core area yet. That meant everyone was wandering around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The periphery was vast. It was unlikely the two demon women would encounter strong enemies there. That was why everyone was shocked at their sudden deaths.</p>

  <p>Since they got killed at the same time, the only possibility was that they encountered a strong opponent.</p>

  <p>Phoenix did not respond to the leader of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Instead, she spread out her hands before her. Golden lines flowed along her arms, like veins pumping gold.</p>

  <p>As the head of the Divine Lair, Phoenix was more powerful than her clansmen. Closing her eyes, she tried seeing into the scene that Lesly and Brylee saw before they died.</p>

  <p>Opening her eyes, she found herself flying haphazardly through the thick black smog, unable to slow down. The next thing she knew was a long sword slashing through her neck.</p>

  <p>"It's him!" she suddenly cried, returning to her physical body.</p>

  <p>"It's that damned man!</p>

  <p>How could he fight in the midst of a hurricane?"</p>

  <p>Phoenix turned to glare at Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though she was challenging Qiu Yinhe to a fight.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, like Qiu Yinhe and Winchell, exchanged puzzled glances when they saw Phoenix glaring at them.</p>

  <p>But they were not afraid of her.</p>

  <p>Winchell's eyes met Phoenix's gaze. Turning to Qiu Yinhe, he asked in a confused tone, "What's wrong with Phoenix? Why is she looking at us like that?"</p>

  <p>"The members of the Jin Wu are connected to each other by blood,"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe said carefully. "I guess some important figures have died."</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe was a smart man. He figured it out in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Were they killed by the disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace?" Winchell asked, beaming at the possibility.</p>

  <p>"I think so." Qiu Yinhe nodded.</p>

  <p>They had predicted that the other races would target the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the members of the Jin Wu had made their move, but ultimately failed against a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Once he was done speaking, Qiu Yinhe turned back to watch the mirror.</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of time before everyone entered the core area of the Chaotic Source World. When this time came, there would be many bloody battles.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe wasn't worried about the Bearing race, or even the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>What he was worried about was the young man in black who came from the Black Ship. The man was extremely hostile to Luo Zheng. No doubt there would be a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>Some nonhuman races surged forward, forced by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>When they passed by Luo Zheng, who calmly stood still amidst the whirling wind, their eyes popped open in shock.</p>

  <p>They all wondered in awe how he was able to resist this damned hurricane.</p>

  <p>"A single feather from the Wing King sheltered me from the hurricane with thousands of Jun of force. I wonder how powerful the Wing King truly is." Even Luo Zheng was surprised.</p>

  <p>Just now, he faced two powerful demon women in the hurricane.</p>

  <p>But the moment he pulled out the feather, he had defeated them in one swift blow. Moreover, the strong wind didn't faze him at all.</p>

  <p>This Other Shore Token was definitely much more powerful than any other bodily movement skill or token. No wonder the Wing King was considered the strongest master of a ruling force.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew against the direction of the wind, without slowing down. He headed for the collapsed cave.</p>

  <p>Initially, he had planned to look for the space rings of Lesly and Brylee.</p>

  <p>They must have a lot of magic weapons. Even though they might not work for him, he could give them to Sally and the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, when Lesly and Brylee were killed, their bodies were blown away by the hurricane. It was quite difficult to find them. Finally, Luo Zheng retreated to look for the others.</p>

  <p>Inside the collapsed cave, Sally and Chaim were hiding in a narrow space, just big enough to shield them from the whirling wind.</p>

  <p>Just then, the full force of the hurricane surged forward on top of the cave, slicing through some stones like a knife. Although the two were protected, they crouched uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>Sally had been worried about Luo Zheng and constantly tried to locate him through the soul mark.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng had quickly flown away. But at some point, he suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Sally froze for a moment. She thought the hurricane had stopped, but when she looked up, she found that it was still whistling. It had only been a few minutes. The hurricane wouldn't stop so soon.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if Luo Zheng rushes into another cave to take shelter, ' Sally pondered worriedly.</p>

  <p>Later, Luo Zheng was actually flying towards them amidst the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Feeling the soul mark vibrate, Sally covered her mouth in shock.</p>

  <p>"Sally, what's wrong with you?" Chaim, noticing her strange behavior, looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng!" she exclaimed, her face full of disbelief. "He's coming to us!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible." Chaim shook his head. "Unless he's flying in the underground..."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely not! How could he move so quickly in the underground? He must be flying in the sky!" Sally said with certainty.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Sally. No one can resist this hurricane. Even the omnipotent Luo Zheng can't do it," said Chaim with a smile.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm possessed thousands of Jun of force, so they could resist the hurricane. Even though Chaim didn't believe Sally, her expression was so resolute that even he faltered.</p>

  <p>"He'll be here soon," Sally said confidently. She knew that Luo Zheng was closing in on them.</p>

  <p>In no time, they saw Luo Zheng freely flying in the hurricane like a lithe bird in the springtime. Steadily, he landed in the middle of the cave.</p>
