  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone left the area as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>Even in the outer area of the Dark Nether Cave, any place of great danger was an inescapable one. If any one of them was not careful enough, everyone would die there as a result.</p>

  <p>A faint green light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes. Even if he was retreating, he was still extremely alert.</p>

  <p>Although the Bull-like Giant Toad and its long tongue were proven to be very fast, Luo Luo Zheng had quite a distance away from it, and he had plenty of room to either hide or dodge.</p>

  <p>However, if the giant toad were to pounce at him, he would be at his wit's end. Everyone would definitely die.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed that the toad had already left the huge pond. It had taken two steps forward but then stopped and became still. Its dark figure had blended into the darkness, but its two large eyes, which were about the size of a house, were gleaming - and they were staring coldly at him!</p>

  <p>"Fortunately," Luo Luo Zheng whispered, his breath labored. "It doesn't intend to chase us." As he continued to retreat his eyes never left the toad in the darkness.</p>

  <p>After making sure that he was at a safe distance away from the huge monster, he finally turned around and followed the group.</p>

  <p>"Okay, where did that toad come from?" Xun asked, turning to Yolande who was by her side.</p>

  <p>Several war lords glanced at Xun with confused looks, wondering why she was asking such a question. The giant toad had been in this cave for a long time, and its site had already been clearly marked on the map of the Dark Nether Cave. It was said that this toad had never moved out of the pond, and there were no stories as to how it got there. It just had always been there.</p>

  <p>The monsters in the Dark Nether Cave were all very complex and varied, and they were all usually strong enough to shake the world.</p>

  <p>If any powerful monster rushed out of the Cursed Land, it could bring a calamity to the Sea God Continent. Take this giant toad as an example, perhaps no one on the entire Sea God Continent would be able to deal with it!</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that although the Dark Nether Cave was full of powerful monsters, none of them had ever stepped out of the cave so far. No one knew what the real reason was, but most people speculated that these creatures were afraid of the Cursed Land and didn't dare to walk out of the Dark Nether Cave's domain.</p>

  <p>However, this conjecture was quickly proven to be false. The Dark Nether Cave was underground, so these monsters could easily dig a passageway and come out to another part of the Sea God Continent. But then again, none of these powerful monsters had done such a thing. Obviously, it was not that easy to figure out the truth of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>"It's the Bull-like Giant Toad, one of Richards' spirit beasts," Yolande answered directly.</p>

  <p>"Richards?" Xun repeated, slightly surprised. "The man who nearly became a world lord?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he's dead now," Yolande said flatly.</p>

  <p>Although the conversation between the two was brief, everyone understood what they were talking about. And it didn't matter if they didn't - they now knew that the giant toad could be tamed as a spirit beast, and there were actually some people among them who were proficient enough in capturing beasts.</p>

  <p>But then, a question remained - would they be able to capture a spirit beast of a man who was powerful enough to be a world lord? That would be equivalent to courting death.</p>

  <p>Everyone followed Fabian and kept retreating until they finally returned to their normal route.</p>

  <p>Many of the people's faces were still as pale as a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>Jarrod counted the number of people. After being chased by those strange birds, out of over a hundred human warriors, only less than fifty survived, while a dozen top-level war lords had also been killed.</p>

  <p>In a terrible situation like this, it was fortunate enough that they were not annihilated completely.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we just return to the tower?" A top-level war lord suggested.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of death. Once before, he had entered the Dark Nether Cave, but he had never encountered such a great danger. Because of this, he felt that there must have been some sort of change that happened within the Dark Nether Cave and it led him to his suggestion.</p>

  <p>The moment other war lords and war generals heard him, they overwhelmingly agreed to his suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I agree. The monsters in Dark Nether Cave have been acting too actively this year. I feel that something is amiss."</p>

  <p>"Just to be on the safe side, I think we better leave. The Dark Nether Cave opens every year anyway. We can wait for that and just enter again."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to stay in this damned place any longer. I heard that anyone who enters the Dark Nether Cave has a slim chance of surviving. But in my opinion, it's a 100 percent chance of dying!"</p>

  <p>As everyone joined in the discussion, Fabian and Jarrod slowly nodded in approval. This trip to Dark Nether Cave was indeed unlucky, coming in and immediately encountering such a huge crisis. To be safe, it was better to give the mission up and return to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, they were not the one who would make the final decision.</p>

  <p>Fabian looked at Luo Luo Zheng. He was the one who had a say in the whole thing.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng felt Fabian's gaze on him, a faint smile graced his lips. "If you guys intend to go back, of course I won't have any objections. But I won't go with you. I will stay here."</p>

  <p>Xun stayed quiet, but her calm gaze and red pupils that seemed to have faint flames circulating within seemed to convey that she would be staying with Luo Luo Zheng. Yolande then broke the silence and said, "I will not leave Luo Zheng's side. With him, I also intend to explore the Dark Nether Cave."</p>
