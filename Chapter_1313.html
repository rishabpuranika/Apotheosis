<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1313 Counting </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Owing to the Roaring Token's incredibly valuable status, possession and use of it were usually reserved to the richest and most powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Amritpal and Myles, both renowned as extremely strong warriors in the entire universe, were known to use it just to quarrel with each other.</p>

  <p>It was extremely troublesome for those who heard them constantly but nobody was willing to provoke the ire of these two, not even the other Supreme Lords themselves.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because they were extremely, terrifyingly strong. It was mostly because Amritpal and Myles were both independent warriors who could afford to go on a reckless rampage if ever angered by anyone without having to think of too serious repercussions.</p>

  <p>So even if the way they used their Roaring Tokens disgruntled a lot of people, these people could only swallow their complaints and bear with it.</p>

  <p>They comforted themselves by simply cursing these two people in private.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, wasn't really keen on subtlety. He actually blamed these two Supreme Lords with his own Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>It was stupid but also incredibly impressive.</p>

  <p>Yolande coughed to clear the liquid she had choked on moments before, dumbfounded by Luo Zheng's boldness.</p>

  <p>'What an interesting boy, ' she thought to herself. 'I really wonder where he is now after ascending from the Lower World.'</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but agree with her clone in the Tower of Sin. Anyone without a destined fate was significant for the era and it wasn't right for others to forcefully change their fate.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't have a destined fate but if he happens to ascend to my world, then it must be destiny pulling strings to let us meet again," she murmured before walking out of the pool.</p>

  <p>Just as she left the fog, a faint green light enveloped her body, fitting her with an elegant green dress.</p>

  <p>At that moment, five to six transmission passageways flickered in front of her, containing each one of her clones.</p>

  <p>All the clones took off their clothes and were preparing to fuse into her main body.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande held up her hand, "Wait here for me. I need to go and deal with something first."</p>

  <p>The clones obediently froze, like puppets waiting for their puppeteer to pull their strings and allow them to move.</p>

  <p>The 'something' that Yolande had to deal with was finding out the names of those who had recently ascended from the Lower World. She issued an order asking for a comprehensive list of these people and she was determined to go through this list meticulously.</p>

  <p>Her subordinate was baffled at this strange request of hers, not really sure why she'd want such information. However, Yolande was boss and there was no way he was going to neglect her order so he quickly set out to accomplish this strange request.</p>

  <p>Countless of ascending passageways abounded in the thousands of supreme worlds under her control. A compiled list of all those who ascended was not going to be an easy task.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, back to Luo Zheng's declaration of fury towards the two Supreme Lords. The warriors, world lords, and Supreme Lords who heard it felt the same as Yolande.</p>

  <p>All of them had been completely taken aback by this bold move.</p>

  <p>'Who the hell is this guy?' they all wondered. 'How could he have the courage to be so rude to the Supreme Lords?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's initial attempt to contact Yan by yelling out her name had already got him some attention. However, this sudden declaration of hostility from him raised this attention to new heights! Trillions of creatures now wondered about who and where he was.</p>

  <p>The two Supreme Lords he had chided grew silent but Myles's angry voice soon resounded across the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"You insolent brat! Do you know who I am?!" he screamed. Myles was someone who could never tolerate being scolded due to his violent temper.</p>

  <p>Hearing his angry voice, everyone thought this would be enough to silence the young man who had infuriated two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's courage was admirable but angering the powerful was never a smart move. Still, the listeners couldn't help but feel elated. The entire universe had put up with the two farts' intermittent quarrels over the years and hearing an unknown junior scold these two mighty lords was like a breath of fresh air.</p>

  <p>However, the Roaring Token was a rare and incredibly valuable item.</p>

  <p>This unknown junior might've stumbled upon several tokens purely by luck but once he used them up, they figured that he wouldn't be able to respond to the Supreme Lords afterwards.</p>

  <p>But then, everyone's assumptions were always wrong when it came to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know who you are. You're Supreme Lord Myles, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng answered through his Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Myles scoffed, "You actually dare scold a Supreme Lord? Are you courting death boy?!" the lord spat angrily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chuckled, "Of course I don't want to die, but what can you do to me anyway?"</p>

  <p>Myles might be a Supreme Lord but there were countless races and countless creatures in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Searching the one hundred thousand supreme worlds for just one voice was more difficult than looking for a needle in a haystack. Myles had no idea who Luo Luo Zheng was and he had no clue where to find him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was well aware of this which was the reason why he scolded them so boldly. No matter how mad they got, they wouldn't be able to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, it wasn't just him, many people had already done this in the past.</p>

  <p>When there were still many Roaring Tapirs in the universe and the Roaring Token wasn't that rare, the universe was filled with constant, endless noise.</p>

  <p>If a group of world lords were dissatisfied with a Supreme Lord, they would hand over around a thousand Roaring Tokens to a subordinate who would then scold this Supreme Lord all day long. This was once common and the noises that filled the ears of trillions of creatures were almost enough to drive them mad!</p>

  <p>But then the population of the Roaring Tapirs dwindled and people couldn't recklessly use their Roaring Tokens anymore. Even a Supreme Lord had to think twice before using the few he had in his possession.</p>

  <p>Amritpal, who had only been hostile with Myles before, now joined the conversation since he also got scolded, "It's true that we can't do anything to you but I wonder just how many Roaring Tokens you can afford to argue with us."</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, a cocky grin appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He originally had no intention of provoking the two Supreme Lords and only scolded them to vent out his frustrations over failing to contact Yan.</p>

  <p>But they were the ones that asked for it.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to know how many Roaring Tokens I have?"</p>

  <p>"Can you count them for me?"</p>

  <p>His words rendered entire populations speechless. Those two sentences could've been merged in one but Luo Luo Zheng chose to purposely divide them in two.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord couldn't afford to be so wasteful.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't end there.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly began to count.</p>

  <p>"One."</p>

  <p>"Two."</p>

  <p>"Three."</p>

  <p>"Four."</p>

  <p>"Five."</p>

  <p>He paused every time he counted, obviously using a Roaring Token for each number.</p>

  <p>This display of extravagance got all the living creatures talking.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! How many Roaring Tokens does this guy actually have?"</p>

  <p>"He's already gotten to ten! That's enough to purchase an ordinary tenth-grade sacred place! Just who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's a rich Supreme Lord's descendant? I've never seen such a spendthrift!"</p>

  <p>Similar remarks were made by various creatures all over the universe.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng continued counting.</p>

  <p>"Twenty."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one..."</p>

  <p>"One hundred..."</p>

  <p>Both Myles and Amritpal were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>Sure, the two of them had more Roaring Tokens than most people but it could never compare to the amount Luo Luo Zheng had. Myles had a lot since he raised several hundred Roaring Tapirs. However, his current supply only amounted to a little over a hundred and the next batch of tokens wasn't due to be produced anytime soon.</p>

  <p>Amritpal had less with only eighty Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>And even if their token collection was larger than any other Supreme Lords, the fact remained that they couldn't afford to squander them away like Luo Luo Zheng was currently doing.</p>

  <p>They truly could not comprehend just how this unknown young man from god knows where got ahold of so many Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Trading just a few of these tokens would've been enough to obtain a huge amount of resources for his cultivation! Why did he choose to use them this way?</p>

  <p>While they ruminated on this, Luo Zheng's voice continued to resound throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>"One hundred and ten..."</p>

  <p>"One hundred and twenty..."</p>

  <p>"One hundred and thirty..."</p>

  <p>The numbers only went larger and larger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's counting lasted for a full four hours. During this time the listeners' feelings went from astonishment to disbelief, and then numbness. He was at the ten thousandth mark when a voice finally interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what are you doing? Is counting so much fun?"</p>

  <p>It was a light, ethereal voice of a woman, and was extremely pleasing to the ears.</p>

  <p>But the moment the world lords and Supreme Lords heard this voice, their faces changed drastically!</p>
