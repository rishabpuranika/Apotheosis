  <p>Because of excellent dexterity, the Cloud Hall disciple finished with a fantastic landing. His bodily movement skill was even more perfect than Lewis'.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng followed suit by doing a backflip to change his position in the air. He came at one of the floating stones and attempted to snatch it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his skills were not as consummate as Lewis. So, the stone began to turn once Luo Luo Zheng applied too much force on it. Luckily, however, Luo Luo Zheng had grasped a corner of the stone. He followed the stone to twirl around until he could steady himself on top of it.</p>

  <p>Raising his head, Luo Luo Zheng saw Frank and Patrick both trying their best to catch a stone.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lewis slowly resumed his flamboyant manner after getting into the vortex. Taking advantage of his superb technique in bodily movement, he jumped on the floating stones like a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water. Meanwhile, he let out non-stop shrieks to demonstrate that he was affected.</p>

  <p>After everyone had a stone and stabilized themselves, the Cloud Hall disciple suddenly pointed his finger above and said, "Look, up there! It's the exit of Death Road!"</p>

  <p>When people heard him, they were delighted. They all raised their heads and followed the direction of his finger. They could see floating stones everywhere in the abyss. At the top of the abyss was a bright light. They could even see shattered floating remnants there.</p>

  <p>They only needed to get up there, with the help of the stones, to safely leave the Death Road.</p>

  <p>Finally seeing the silver lining made them glad. However, there was also a bit of disappointment. They took the risk to brave the Death Road hoping for a bigger reward. But in truth, they were only able to take away a portion of the Devil Phantom essences. And they were far from satisfied with it.</p>

  <p>For now, survival was the priority. And coming out of Death Road alive would make them all heroes.</p>

  <p>Giggling, Lewis remarked, "It's not as difficult as it seems..." He stepped on a small stone as big as a fist and wiggled his body as if playing in a variety show. What Lewis was doing was showing off his bodily movement skills.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall disciple gently smiled and said, "Not difficult? The difficult challenges will come soon enough."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, they heard several unmistakable booming sounds in the air.</p>

  <p>A loud bang, bang, bang filled the air.</p>

  <p>"Look down there!" Patrick shouted as he pointed at the black abyss below. A tremendous head was now approaching. It turned out to be the head of a colossal flood dragon!</p>

  <p>But why was its head so huge? The head alone seemed to have filled the whole abyss. And there were big chains on the flood dragon's head. The clinking sound everyone was hearing came from the chains.</p>

  <p>"It's the flood dragon. Go up quickly!" came a warning shout. At the warning, Frank lifted Lois, and they both jumped up onto the floating stones as they darted upward at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Nothing frightened them as much as the enormous flood dragon. Though not a legendary beast, there were two notable things about the flood dragon: it was related to the genuine dragon, and it had dragon blood.</p>

  <p>During the All Peaks Competition, Jacques amazed everyone with the power that emitted from a flood dragon bone in his hand. Now, the creature right below them was a living and grown-up flood dragon, and no one knew how many millennia it had lived. And with merely a howl, that size of a flood dragon was enough to turn anyone into ashes, completely obliterating them.</p>

  <p id="top_19">"Up! Up! Up!" they screamed.</p>

  <p>Every person scrambled to safety without a moment's hesitation. To accomplish this, they stepped on the floating stones in the hopes they could get rid of the terrifying flood dragon.</p>

  <p>While all this was happening, the Cloud Hall disciple had fixed his eyes on Frank. Then he frowned while thinking. Not long after, he finally shifted his gaze from Frank and settled on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A chilly smile broke the Cloud Hall disciple's face to indicate his satisfaction after he had identified Luo Luo Zheng as his target. Then before the young disciple could react, he was running toward Luo Luo Zheng at what seemed like five or six times the normal speed.</p>

  <p>What was it like to enhance one's speed by five or even six times?</p>

  <p>Even before, the Cloud Hall disciple was already a lot faster than Lewis, who had good bodily movement skills. But now, his speed surged five or six times faster, and that meant one could hardly catch his shadow with the naked eye when he was moving.</p>

  <p>Intent on sprinting up to the top, Luo Luo Zheng was surprised when he suddenly heard a swishing sound coming from below.</p>

  <p>A hidden weapon slicing through the air was the only thing capable of making such whistling sounds. But when Luo Luo Zheng turned his head around, he saw that it was the Cloud Hall disciple who came at him.</p>

  <p>"Wow! That speed is so incredible! How did he do that?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered in surprise. Unable to believe that the man was coming at him, Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>"Is he looking for trouble with me?" he wondered aloud. Right from the start, they had been on guard against this mysterious Cloud Hall disciple.</p>

  <p>But since he never showed any wicked intentions, they reluctantly allowed him to tag along with them.</p>

  <p>Sensing that the Cloud Hall disciple was about to attack him after he stepped on the floating stone, Luo Luo Zheng whirled and ended up with his sword pointed at the man.</p>

  <p>The movement he executed was downward chop of the basic swordsmanship!</p>

  <p>"Since you want to cause me trouble, you'd better be prepared to die!" the young warrior declared.</p>

  <p>With the flood dragon in hot pursuit, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't afford any mishaps. It was too dangerous, and even a small mistake could mean paying with his life.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng had to go all out to get rid of the people who stood in his way.</p>

  <p>The basic swordsmanship move displayed by Luo Luo Zheng confused the Cloud Hall disciple. But after a while, he smiled and without hesitation, grabbed Luo Zheng's Blood Drinking Sword with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>The smile didn't escape Luo Luo Zheng, who thought it looked weird. It evoked a feeling of fascination as if a gentle lady was the one smiling at him. But the man standing before him was definitely a man!</p>

  <p>However, there was no time for Luo Luo Zheng to ponder on this. He didn't expect the Cloud Hall disciple to use a very clever trick in grabbing his sword.</p>

  <p>Because of his exceptional strength, even though the disciple was at the beginning level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Luo Luo Zheng was already considered a warrior without a match. He might not be able to thwart Frank's spear attack, but there were other ways to beat him.</p>

  <p>Although only at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm, the Cloud Hall disciple was brave enough to grab Luo Zheng's sword with his bare hands. The move was so daring. It was incredible.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall disciple smiled eerily at Luo Luo Zheng then said softly, "You're going down with me!" Before Luo Luo Zheng could react, he felt his clothes being dragged down by the Cloud Hall disciple until they fell from the floating stone and into a deep, dark pit.</p>

  <p>Right below them was the enormous flood dragon, which was rapidly rising, making the situation twice as dangerous.</p>
