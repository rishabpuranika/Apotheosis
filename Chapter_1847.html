<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was still a certain distance between the barbarian bee queen and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But if the barbarian bee queen took a step forward, it would be extremely difficult for Luo Luo Zheng and his companion to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Pop, pop, pop!</p>

  <p>With this bubbling sound, three barbarian bee stings once again shot towards the rock wall behind the two of them.</p>

  <p>At first, it sounded like the silvery rock was being boiled, like hot water.</p>

  <p>However, it slowly changed and began to flow smoothly. One could only imagine the strong and corrosive power that was enclosed within these barbarian bee stings.</p>

  <p>The hole was already the size of a fist. As it continued to corrode, the hole became bigger and bigger!</p>

  <p>Within a matter of seconds, a hole that was huge enough to fit a human head appeared. And that was exactly what they wanted.</p>

  <p>"You can go now," Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>Usually, if the hole was big enough to fit one's head, then the body could get in just fine. However, the stout guy who stood next to Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have a problem. Just by glancing at it, he was skeptical if he could enter.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng, looking at him, realized the doubt that was going on in his mind.</p>

  <p>Teigan's face turned red when he became aware of this fact. Moreover, he began to tremble as well, wondering what would happen to him.</p>

  <p>There was a part of him that worried Luo Luo Zheng would leave him alone to face the barbarian bee queen.</p>

  <p>But that didn't happen. In the end, Luo Luo Zheng decided he wouldn't enter alone.</p>

  <p>Instead, he continued to lure the barbarian bee queen to shoot out the stings.</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen shook its tail to send out the barbarian bee stings and crawled towards the two of them. Tactfully, the two of them moved around the small hole, hoping to lure the barbarian bee queen to shoot stings onto the part around the small hole.</p>

  <p>Under the dire situation, this was their only hope. They secretly prayed that the luck would be on their side. After all, they couldn't control the barbarian bee queen's aim. Sometimes, when the barbarian bee stings were too accurate, they would directly drill into the small hole.</p>

  <p>However, as the stings kept shooting over, more and more rocks behind them started to melt. In the end, a large hole was created, just like they wanted.</p>

  <p>However, before they could relish their success, the barbarian bee queen began to increase its speed. The barbarian bee stings on its tail were now shooting extremely fast. This made it hard for the two of them to dodge them. With his huge body, Teigan, especially, had a tough time defending himself. The barbarian bee stings came very close to getting him.</p>

  <p>Realizing it wasn't safe to stay out any longer, the two of them quickly entered the big hole.</p>

  <p>Since the stings drifting into the cave didn't make any sound, the two of them knew with certainty that the back of the cave was empty. The moment they entered the cave, the two of them began to descend rapidly.</p>

  <p>Once they were in, Luo Luo Zheng could even see the two stings flying above their heads.</p>

  <p>"That barbarian bee queen wouldn't chase us, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his head to take a look, only to see that the barbarian bee queen had stuck out a pair of huge eyes from the hole and retracted them in the end!</p>

  <p>Under such high-intensity gravity, if they were to fall too far, even Luo Luo Zheng was likely to break into a million pieces. 'No, we can't land on that incomparably hard silver-colored rock, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>After collecting his thoughts, he twisted his body and observed the distance below him.</p>

  <p>However, just as he glanced down, Luo Luo Zheng caught sight of a bunch of black dots flying below him. Although he did not know what they were, his instinct told him he had to avoid them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to fly in the air and had no way to dodge them. In the end, he and Teigan both stumbled into the black dots and passed through them. Then, they realized those black dots were fingertip-sized bugs.</p>

  <p>This was a pitch-black area, and they couldn't see the bottom.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they did not hurt themselves after falling. The two of them landed on a slope and continued to descend. The strength of the descent was increasing but the slope became slower. As a consequence, the speed at which the two of them were falling decelerated.</p>

  <p>After rolling to the bottom, they stood up and composed themselves.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Teigan seemed disturbed. He jumped up from the ground and started inspecting his body.</p>

  <p>"What?" A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"These are Mosquito Larvae! We are so unlucky! We just ran into Mosquito Larvae!" Teigan shouted.</p>

  <p>"Mosquito Larvae? What will happen?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, not knowing what was there to be afraid of.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the fear on Teigan's face had intensified. Even while meeting the barbarian bee queen, he didn't seem this anxious. "This thing will lay an egg on a warrior's skin, and then it will hatch inside one's body!" Teigan elaborated.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng's eyebrows creased. He raised his arm and noticed small black spots on his own body. To him, they looked harmless. It was beyond him how these tiny eggs, similar to sesame seeds, could harm them. They were the eggs of the Mosquito Larvae. These eggs were drilled deep into his skin.</p>

  <p>No matter what, it wasn't a pleasant feeling to be wrapped in Mosquito Larvae.</p>

  <p>'These little bugs can't be strong. They seem very weak. How can they enter my body?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered, ludicrously. Luo Luo Zheng, however, couldn't help but become suspicious of his partner's words. He suddenly circulated his chaotic energy and was about to force these small black dots out.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, his trick didn't make things better. Instead, it became worse. With this power, the little black dots began to drill deeper.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked and quickly dispersed his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, out of options.</p>

  <p>Even though Teigan did not possess a bright mind, he was still a man from Collapsing Mountain race. Since he had quickly recognized these Mosquito Larvae, Luo Luo Zheng assumed everyone in the Collapsing Mountain race knew how to deal with them.</p>

  <p>"The only way to get rid of them is use poison," Teigan explained.</p>

  <p>These types of larvae were not rare in the Sacred Spring Mountain, and they even existed in areas beyond the Collapsing Mountain race. After being bitten by these worms, eggs would get attached to the victim's body. This was indeed very troublesome.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the Collapsing Mountain race had no method to deal with it. Patiently, they would wait for the small larvae to hatch and then pick them out with a knife. However, this method was in no way a safe route. Even if one managed to live through it, they would lose at least half their lives by doing it.</p>

  <p>Realizing there had to be a different way to get out of this misery, the Collapsing Mountain race ventured to find out another method. That was when they discovered that these larvae were afraid of a specific poison.</p>

  <p>If one consumed that poison, the Mosquito Larva eggs would be completely destroyed beneath the skin! Unfortunately, this was a risky method. The poison that would be required was quite toxic and extremely strong. From the belt on his waist, Teigan dug out a small purple bottle. "This is rattan poison. It can drive away these larva eggs."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he opened the small bottle and took a sip. He then glanced at Luo Luo Zheng. This fellow had saved his life.</p>

  <p>Now that he no longer held much hostility towards Luo Luo Zheng, he continued,</p>

  <p>"This rattan poison is very strong. Ordinary warriors' bodies wouldn't be able to withstand it at all. I don't dare to drink too much, so I can only restrain these little bugs. How much you can manage to drink depends on your strength."</p>

  <p>If he was an adult of the Collapsing Mountain race, he would have been able to drink the poison in one gulp and force the larva eggs out of his body. But Teigan was too young and just at the start of his adult life.</p>

  <p>Although Collapsing Mountain race was much stronger than ordinary warriors, Teigan dared not to take all of the rattan poison.</p>

  <p>After drinking a little bit, he could only suppress the eggs. He would think of something else when he returned to the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>From his point of view, as a human, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to bear the burden of this poison. He believed a sip was enough to take his life.</p>

  <p>Seeing Teigan's worried expression, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and directly took the bottle from him. This bottle had looked extremely small in the hand of the Collapsing Mountain race man, but in Luo Zheng's hand, it was like a wine pot.</p>

  <p>He accepted the pot of poison and gulped it down. Perhaps Luo Zheng's strength was not outstanding at the moment nor was it exceptional in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. However, there was something about Luo Luo Zheng that Teigan didn't know; he wasn't afraid of poisons.</p>

  <p>"You will?You will die?" Seeing Luo Luo Zheng drink so much in one gulp, Teigan's mouth was wide open. "Actually, these larvae won't kill you.</p>

  <p>You could just pick them out with a knife?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wiped the corner of his mouth and passed the small bottle to Teigan, smiling faintly. "This is very little poison. I will be fine!"</p>

  <p>As he stopped speaking, the poison started to spread continuously through Luo Zheng's meridians. The larva eggs that had infiltrated Luo Zheng's skin seemed to feel an indescribable fear towards him as they continued to leave his skin.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, most of the larva eggs fell to the ground like rice grains after they crawled out. That rattan poison was the nemesis of these larva eggs. Taking just a bit of poison, they would die.</p>

  <p>All this while, Teigan had been staring at Luo Luo Zheng in utter shock. He found it hard to believe in Luo Zheng's words. However, seeing he had faced no difficulty after consuming the poison, Teigan realized it was indeed true.</p>

  <p>It seemed that nothing bad would happen to him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he understood that besides not being afraid of flames, Luo Luo Zheng was also immune to all poisons. 'Isn't that amazing?' he thought with awe.</p>

  <p>Soon, they cleaned up and got rid of the larva eggs. After this, they both began to survey the environment.</p>

  <p>After he lifted his head, Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly lit up. He could already see a bit of seven-colored spring water hidden within the strange rocks on the mountain wall. There was actually quite a lot of strength source there!</p>

  <p>With its constant reversal and flowing characteristics, the strength source hadn't fallen into the upper regions of the ceiling must have been because it was wrapped by these rugged and strange stones.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a thought occurred in his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng subconsciously looked up and his entire body froze!</p>

  <p>Teigan had sensed that something was off with Luo Luo Zheng. Similarly, he followed Luo Zheng's gaze and lifted his head to look above. His burly figure immediately trembled.</p>

  <p>Above their heads, there was actually a seven-colored river that was undoubtedly formed from strength source. They watched it flow, as if it was a dream watercolor painting.</p>
