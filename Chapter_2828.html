  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng had blocked his Dark and Light Destruction Sword, Nicholas was a bit shocked.</p>

  <p>When he came to his senses, the Dark and Light Destruction Sword suddenly twisted. Like a nimble little snake, it snuck away from Luo Zheng's Shadow Bearing Sword, stabbing his head.</p>

  <p>Despite the attack, Luo Zheng looked calm. Lifting his Shadow Bearing Sword, he pushed away Nicholas' strike.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>They were already close to each other to fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng launched again, his strike appearing very decisively and skillfully, while Nicholas swung his sword lightly and constantly.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas could see through the future, Luo Zheng was using this to his advantage by observing his memory.</p>

  <p>As they fought, their sword moves seemed to be set in advance. They appeared like long-time buddies who were practicing their sword skills together.</p>

  <p>The people around them gaped as they watched, thinking they were really just sparring with each other.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Zheng waved his sword, its energy mixed with that of the red lotuses which coiled around the body of the Shadow Bearing Sword, making it even more powerful.</p>

  <p>Although the Dark and Light Destruction Sword was extremely powerful, its black and white light trembled and then dimmed each time it collided with Luo Zheng's Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>If this continued, the Dark and Light Destruction Sword would collapse sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, Luo Zheng grew braver and more formidable.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's eyebrows wrinkled slightly. He tried his best to keep a calm expression, though he was starting to worry. If this continued, his Dark and Light Destruction Sword would not be able to hold on.</p>

  <p>The red lotuses were not very terrifying, but when they were combined with the internal momentum controlled by Luo Zheng, Nicholas found them difficult to resist.</p>

  <p>'What the hell! How could he do that?'</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng knew what Nicholas was thinking, his attack was even more violent.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He struck three times in a row. Even though Nicholas blocked the middle strike, the sword's radiance on both sides still spread out at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Nicholas continued to retreat. At the same time, the light of the Dark and Light Destruction Sword continued to grow dimmer.</p>

  <p>If the fight went on, he was bound to lose.</p>

  <p>'It's...'</p>

  <p>Being proud of his unique skill he had been using, Nicholas couldn't believe that it was not enough to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, Tianming and the blue-eyed girl finally finished their fusion.</p>

  <p>When he raised his hand gently, some beautiful ice flowers started to surround his wrist, emitting a terrible cold air.</p>

  <p>"The blue-eyed girl makes any energy still, putting it under a low temperature," Tianming murmured, staring at the ice flowers.</p>

  <p>"Lowell! Help me!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes lit up the moment he saw Tianming, who was also the Lowell that he knew.</p>

  <p>Seeing the power of the burning of the red lotuses, the remaining Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were all scared to death.</p>

  <p>Since Tianming had merged with the blue-eyed girl, he might have the ability to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tianming turned around when he heard Nicholas' call, but he gazed back with a strange look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The woman was also anxious at the sight of this scene. Tianming accidentally mixed with the girl with blue eyes. If he teamed up with Nicholas, how could Luo Zheng defeat him?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Samuel was observing the fight between Nicholas and Luo Zheng silently. Since the woman was staring at him, it was difficult for him to find an opportunity. But once he found a chance, he would not hesitate to make his move.</p>

  <p>Tianming floated towards the two warriors, gently shaking his right hand to reveal his right arm.</p>

  <p>A golden bandage was wrapped around his arm, showing countless mysterious divine textures all over it.</p>

  <p>These divine textures were engraved by someone Tianming hired in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After he sneaked into the divine land, he had been all alone. Carrying the Soaring Snake Sword would probably make his identity exposed, especially after he entered the Dongfang Clan, so he had to seal the Soaring Snake Sword on his right arm.</p>

  <p>Unwrapping the bandage on his right arm, a vast aura started to emit from it.</p>

  <p>Although the aura emitted by the huge Eight Diagrams on the top of the void was strong, the vast aura from Tianming's arm didn't fall weak at all.</p>

  <p>As the golden light flashed from his right arm, the Soaring Snake Sword appeared in Tianming's hand.</p>

  <p>It shone as bright as the sun under the dazzling golden light.</p>

  <p>"That sword!"</p>

  <p>"I never knew Lowell possesses such a treasure!"</p>

  <p>"Is that sword also a supreme treasure of belief?"</p>

  <p>Some of the spectators were totally confused after sensing the power of Tianming's Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas valued Tianming highly, he was still just a famous consummate True God of the Dongfang Clan. In terms of the status, he was definitely inferior to Troy.</p>

  <p>Where could he have gotten such a treasure?</p>

  <p>Nicholas was shocked to see Tianming with the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword under Luo Zheng's care was already a very powerful match against his Dark and Light Destruction Sword. But the sword Tianming took out was actually more extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Carrying the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand, Tianming flew over in the void and stood between them.</p>

  <p>"Let's work together to kill this brat and split the True Demon Body from his body. When the two True Demon Bodies merge into one, you can have both of them!" Nicholas offered.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas couldn't inherit the True Demon Body, he thought the most suitable candidate to get the True Demon Body would either be Troy or Lowell.</p>

  <p>Lightly shaking the Soaring Snake Sword, Tianming pointed it at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Wisps of cold air rose from its surface as ice formed quietly.</p>

  <p>Raising his eyebrows, Luo Zheng stared at Tianming.</p>

  <p>If Tianming killed him now, he would indeed be able to inherit the complete True Demon Body. If he chose to turn traitor at this moment, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Nicholas' face. He was about to move and join hands with Tianming.</p>

  <p>But Tianming shifted and pointed his sword's tip at Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The other people in the void, including Samuel and that woman, gasped.</p>

  <p>Their faces were filled with confusion as they watched what had been happening.</p>

  <p>Of course, everyone had a different mood.</p>

  <p>"Lowell? Why is he pointing his sword at Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he the consummate True God of the Dongfang Clan?"</p>

  <p>"Troy has been skeptical of Lowell before, saying there is something wrong with his origin. I can't believe that his suspicions are right."</p>

  <p>Rachelle was close to Troy, so she knew his doubts before. But the Dongfang Clan's affair was not something that others would casually ask about. Now Troy was dead, and there was indeed something wrong with Lowell.</p>

  <p>"Lowell, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas got gloomy upon seeing Tianming's action. He immediately thought of Troy.</p>

  <p>He was previously approached by Troy as he was skeptical about Tianming's origin, but he didn't take it seriously. He thought that Troy just felt that his position was threatened by Tianming, so he was jealous of him. It was naturally for him to hate him.</p>

  <p>The point was that in Nicholas' opinion, he was still able to suppress Tianming who had the strange background. After all, Tianming was only a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Even the Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings would be controlled by him, let alone the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas was shocked as he hadn't expected that he would encounter such a matter.</p>
