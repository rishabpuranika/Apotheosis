<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's judgment was quick. As soon as he saw the red balls of light, he immediately deduced that they weren't weak compared to the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he felt that the Regal Jade Spirit's emotions had fluctuated wildly. He sensed that there was some kind of uncontrollable anger.</p>

  <p>"That's the Nihility race," said the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization was known for their intimidating aura, back when they first set foot on the Other Shore. In a short period of time, they had become one of the top ten civilizations, and the Wing King had become a highly important and powerful existence on the Other Shore. However, due to the conflict with the Nihility race, they had no choice but to hide under the black pool of the Dark Region at Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>From that scenario, one could imagine the opposition between the Regal Jade Civilization and the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"They are of the Nihility race? Why do they look like the Element Spirit race?" asked Zheng. He continued to study the red balls in the distance.</p>

  <p>Inside the iron house in the energy vortex, the Shape-shifting Spirit had once transformed into a circular ball, which was the form of an Element Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves descended from the Element Spirit race, but the two red balls looked more like the Element Spirit race than the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>"Humph! The Nihility race is not a civilization. They are a group of creatures that believe in the Nihility Way.</p>

  <p>Or rather, they are the traitors from different races," the Regal Jade Spirit sneered.</p>

  <p>There was a clear and obvious resentment in the Regal Jade Spirit's voice at the mention of the Nihility race. "I see..." Zheng simply nodded.</p>

  <p>He never expected that breaking into this place with the Other Shore Key would alert all those powerful beings from the upper stages, one after another.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the two Moon Fire Slaves also noticed the two red balls at the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Two Nihility Spirits. They are traitors," No. 12 said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to get rid of them?" No. 13 asked. Naturally, the Element Spirit race did not tolerate traitors.</p>

  <p>If they ever came across any betrayers from their race, they would fight them to the death.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. It's more important to get the Other Shore Key. Go wake up No.</p>

  <p>14. Use my star dust to recover his strength," No. 12 commanded.</p>

  <p>Their original plan was to return home after they had obtained the Other Shore Key, and then awaken No. 14.</p>

  <p>But now that the Nihility race was there, not only did they have to get the Other Shore Key, but fight against the Nihility Spirits as well.</p>

  <p>In addition, they had no choice but to wake up No. 14 right then and there because they needed help. However, they had to consume the extremely precious star dust in order to do so.</p>

  <p>In turn, No. 13 hurriedly took out the spiritual core. "Don't worry and don't be too anxious. Those two Nihility Spirits won't be able to catch up with us so soon..." No. 12 consoled.</p>

  <p>In any case, the Hidden Beasts would be in the Nihility Spirits' way and that would buy them some time.</p>

  <p>Before No. 12 could finish speaking, they suddenly heard an Extremity Mouse squeak.</p>

  <p>Then, the Extremity Mice swarmed the lamp posts.</p>

  <p>Although the Hidden Beasts tied to the lamp posts were powerful, they were alone and did not have any help. They wouldn't stand a chance against the huge number of Extremity Mice. Furthermore, even if the power of settlement could kill dozens of Extremity Mice, more and more mice would still come.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, countless Extremity Mice rushed towards the Hidden Spirit Lamps and extinguished the black flames with their own bodies.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, they immediately headed to the next lamp posts without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>One lamp post...</p>

  <p>Two lamp posts...</p>

  <p>Three lamp posts...</p>

  <p>The black flames on the lamp posts swiftly died out, and the two Nihility Spirits moved forward smoothly. They were so fast that their speed was more than ten times faster than Zheng's and the two Moon Fire Slaves'.</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly shocked when he saw how quickly they moved. At such a rate, it would only take them five minutes to pass through the circular desert area.</p>

  <p>However, he shifted his focus on dealing with the Hidden Beasts in front of him. After he passed by three lamp posts, he finally reached the edge of the desert and arrived at the annular grassland ahead.</p>

  <p>The two connected circular areas were like two different spaces. Zheng and Elvinia stepped onto the grassland, and then disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>At the same time, No. 13 continuously sprinkled the star dust onto No. 14's spiritual core. Once No. 14 had absorbed enough star dust, green flames burned from the spiritual core and eventually transformed into No. 14's body. Even the originally broken armor was also restored piece by piece.</p>

  <p>After No. 14 regained consciousness, he saw the two red balls that moved in the distance. "Well, why are there two Nihility Spirits?" No. 14 asked.</p>

  <p>"Ready to fight," No. 12 answered.</p>

  <p>The sight of the Nihility Spirits that moved forward effortlessly with the help of the Extremity Mice made No. 12 very upset. They had to kill the two Nihility Spirits before they fought with the two humans for the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Yet, the two Nihility Spirits had no intention of approaching the Moon Fire Slaves. They moved a distance, and then directed the Extremity Mice to make a detour, which meant that they bypassed the area where the Moon Fire Slaves were.</p>

  <p>To add salt to the wound, the figure in one of the red balls even made a provoking gesture to the Moon Fire Slaves before it left.</p>

  <p>In the end, the three Moon Fire Slaves could do nothing but watch the Nihility Spirits surpass them. They had no choice but to extinguish the lamps one by one.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng had entered the second circular area, and the grey marks on his body were automatically settled.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the settlement was quite intense, he could still bear it. Besides, he didn't have time to think too much now. The Nihility race would soon catch up.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>He quickly slipped his arm around Elvinia's waist. Lightning flashed on his back, and they flew up in the air in no time.</p>

  <p>From the outside, he saw that there was no difference between the grassland in the ring and the one in the south. When they stepped into the ring, however, he found that the grassland there was shrouded in a thick white mist.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that he should be wary of the strange white mist, he didn't want to stay at the entrance any longer.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, his thunder wings flapped and they flew forward in a straight line.</p>

  <p>If there were no obstructions, it would only take a few seconds for him to cover this distance.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the thick, milky white mist blocked the two people's eyesight.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng had traveled forward for dozens of seconds already. At his speed, he was able to fly back and forth about four times within the area, but he still couldn't pass through the white mist. "What's going on?" Elvinia asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong. We are not moving forward," Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not that easy to pass through this area," Elvinia answered and shook her head.</p>

  <p>Overall, Elvinia had been an invincible being on the Other Shore ever since she got the body of the purified being. Even the creatures in the Dark Region couldn't do anything to her.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the first area of the temple had been so dangerous, let alone the second one.</p>

  <p>As a result, she became more curious about the temple.</p>

  <p>What kind of civilization had set up such a space and built the temple?</p>

  <p>What exactly was hidden inside the temple?</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, what he currently thought about was how to pass through the area they were in. He flew forward for a distance, and then descended from the white mist.</p>

  <p>He had flown so close to the grass that was a few hundred feet tall. Thus, he should be able to leave the mist very soon if he descended like the way he did now. However, after he came down vertically from a height of over ten thousand feet, the place below him was still covered in white mist. He couldn't get to the bottom.</p>

  <p>Of course, Elvinia also realized that there was an endless void below them, and she couldn't help but hold onto Zheng more tightly.</p>
