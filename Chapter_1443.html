<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It made no sense. How was it possible that Luo Luo Zheng, a warrior who had just reached the Soul Sea Realm, could break free from his restraining power?</p>

  <p>Yosef could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>His binding technique didn't look threatening, but it made up for what it lacked in presentation of strength, like a giant bearing down his weight to squash a miniscule, feeble insect. Perhaps he too had been fooled by appearances. This particular insect he was dealing with was much stronger than he thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a huge force pressing down on his body. He was struggling, but he was able to resist it, walking with big, forceful steps towards the entrance of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Not only Yosef had been surprised by the sudden turn of events. The Saint Lords of the Demon Night and the humans watched with strange expressions on their faces. Clearly, none of them had expected this.</p>

  <p>"How interesting," Yosef sneered. He was not one to lose. Once more, he raised his hand to press a thick finger towards Luo Luo Zheng, doubling the force of his bindings.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a greater force enveloping his body. He was the sole target of Yosef's technique, and all of its power was directed at him. He felt his muscles complain as the force around him grew heavier.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes and focused. With a deep breath, he activated the power of more than ten thousand dragon scales in his body.</p>

  <p>The spectators watched Luo Luo Zheng pause for a moment. The next thing they heard was a loud crackle coming from within his body as it expanded.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" Blood rushed to Yosef's head as rage took over him. It was simply ridiculous that a mere warrior at the Soul Sea Realm would be able to subdue the strength of his giant finger. In a fury-filled move, he poured all strength and sent his entire palm towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Yosef, think about your position. You are a Saint Lord. It would be disgraceful to compete with a junior!"</p>

  <p>The human Saint Lord could no longer stand Yosef's contemptible pride.</p>

  <p>With a light wave of his hand, he dispelled the tremendous force that came from Yosef to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The next second, Luo Luo Zheng felt freed from the invisible force that bound him earlier. The human Saint Lord then released the force that had been suppressing Lincoln's and Freya's bodies.</p>

  <p>The human Saint Lord's words poured over Yosef's senses like ice, dousing his rage and pulling him back to his senses. Yosef chuckled. "I am not competing with him. I just think that he is a bit interesting."</p>

  <p>With Yosef's anger visibly placated, a smile curled on the human Saint Lord's face. He had thought the same exact thing. Just now, he helped Luo Luo Zheng because he could sense his potential. It would be a waste not to see what the promising young warrior could do in the future. After they had explored the underground palace, he planned on taking him into the Magnolia Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>With no one stopping Luo Luo Zheng and the others, they walked quickly towards the entrance of the underground palace. Adrian, who was not far away, had a smile plastered on his face as he said loudly, "Lincoln, please wait for me!"</p>

  <p>Time was of the essence. Adrian knew that if he didn't follow them in now, he would lose the chance to enter under the eyes of the Saint Lords present. He spoke to Lincoln in a familiar way deliberately, because it would help make sure that no one was likely to stop him.</p>

  <p>Ab had been scared out of his wits. When he saw Adrian following the group, he decided to follow him closely from behind.</p>

  <p>The underground palace of the Dark World opened, and the four of them were the first ones to enter.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the martial artists of the ogres, the Demon Night, and humans entered the underground palace after them.</p>

  <p>A dark yellow enchanted barrier was placed in front of the entrance. It was an ancient spell, but its effects remained to be potent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng passed the barrier with ease. He lifted his foot and passed through it, with Lincoln, Freya, Adrian and Ab stepping inside next.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng passed through the barrier, it was as if his foot landed on air. The next moment, he found himself suddenly plummeting downwards.</p>

  <p>He was plunging down into a bottomless abyss.</p>

  <p>The same happened to Lincoln, Freya, Ab, and Adrian.</p>

  <p>In this situation, ordinary martial artists would direct their life vitality in an attempt to stabilize their bodies in the air and moderate the rapid fall.</p>

  <p>Freya, Lincoln and the others did this very thing, channeling their energy to float in the air. However, it proved to be completely useless.</p>

  <p>Ab had even used the Wind Law to form a strong storm underneath him.</p>

  <p>Even this failed to stop his fall.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he took a step forward, and with a slight flash, he grabbed onto Freya and took another step, attempting to travel through the space.</p>

  <p>He had used the Space Law, but the resulting occurrence was very strange. He had travelled some distance, but the moment he came out of the space, he and Freya did not elevate, but proceeded to fall.</p>

  <p>"How strange," Lincoln remarked. They had tried many different methods, but not one of these succeeded. They kept falling downward into the dark abyss.</p>

  <p>"Ahh?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" a shout echoed through the space. Luo Luo Zheng looked up to see that the martial artists sent by the three Saint Lords were also falling downward with them.</p>

  <p>They were in an unfamiliar territory, but Luo Luo Zheng calmed himself down.</p>

  <p>There was no use panicking. "Xun, what's going on?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Xun smiled mischievously. "I'm just giving you a little surprise. Welcome to the Endless Abyss!" she said cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"The Endless Abyss?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was constructed by the Supreme Lord from remote ages. Flight is impossible here. Everyone and everything that enters will only descend continuously." In an instant, Xun's smile disappeared, her face returning to an indifferent mask.</p>

  <p>"So we just keep falling down like this?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You could say that. Don't worry. You won't be falling to your death,"</p>

  <p>Xun replied.</p>

  <p>They continued to fall towards the bottom of the abyss, dropping at an accelerating speed. It was only after they reached a certain distance that their speed stabilized.</p>

  <p>They had been like a house of cards in a thunderstorm, but after a while, they got used to the sensation and started to wonder when they would stop as their eyes searched aimlessly in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The weakest of the martial artists who entered the underground palace were at the Soul Sea Realm. Most of them were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, so they remained undaunted with the fall and the darkness. They were, however, on tenterhooks from the vast, unknown space. There was no telling what awaited them at the bottom of this abyss.</p>

  <p>They continued to descend, their senses tingling with agitation as the wind blew past their ears. They kept falling for five minutes.</p>

  <p>As they descended, Luo Zheng's eyes wandered around the surroundings within the abyss. It was impossible to decipher what sort of token the Supreme Lord had used, or the reason why he built such a strange abyss.</p>

  <p>However, one thing was clear. The creator had undergone great lengths in order to construct the dark space.</p>

  <p>Having reached a wall with his questions, Luo Luo Zheng turned to ask Xun once again.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she answered simply. "A hundred thousand years ago when I explored this abyss, my cultivation was just at the Spirit Supreme Realm. I am more or less familiar with the underground palace, but I had not succeeded in discovering all of its secrets. The Supreme Lord's origins are obscure and mysterious. Until today, no one has been able to uncover his true identity. There is a possibility that he constructed his own grave in this way in order to choose a worthy successor. That, however, is only my guess."</p>

  <p>A long time had passed since the abyss' creation. No one knew what sort of tribulations the creator had gone through in the past before he built the underground palace.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," Xun warned. "If I remember correctly, the first ordeal in the Endless Abyss should arrive at this time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's blood froze as he looked down. There, at the bottom of the pit were dark-green vines as thick as an arm, their spikes densely packed together.</p>

  <p>He was only several thousand feet away from the vines. At the rate of their fall, the vines would pierce them immediately.</p>
