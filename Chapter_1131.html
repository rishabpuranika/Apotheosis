<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The scattered warriors all continued to head towards the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea was like a huge mine for them. After a sacrificial ceremony, the blood sacrifice power would get pushed to a lower level, but this would only last for around five days.</p>

  <p>After that, the blood sacrifice power would gush out from the depths of the Feather Holy Sea and cover the sea once again. Then even the Soul Sea Realm masters would find it difficult to take a single step forward.</p>

  <p>As the group slowed down, Luo Zheng, who was also following Randy, slowed down, and started descending slowly.</p>

  <p>However, several figures were shooting at them from the shore. The person in the lead was surrounded by lightning.</p>

  <p>Randy glanced back at the figure and said, "That is the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom, Fredric Liu."</p>

  <p>In the previous match, Fredric Liu did not fight with anyone.</p>

  <p>The royal family wouldn't usually participate in this sort of a battle, but since Fiona had already joined the fight, many princes of the divine kingdoms wanted to challenge and fight Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng had fought with the little monster, War Emperor York had personally fought with Luo Zheng, but he had vomited blood after being punched by Luo Zheng. Seeing this, the crown princes of the divine kingdoms had all given up on this idea.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was able to harm a Soul Sea Realm master, surely he must be very powerful and remarkable.</p>

  <p>However, this did not mean that they accepted defeat. After so many years, countless brilliant talents had appeared in the four great divine kingdoms. Zheng's strength might have surpassed them right now, but that did not mean they could not become more powerful than Luo Zheng in the future.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the crown princes of the divine kingdoms were armed with semi-divine as well as divine weapons. They still looked down upon Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Fredric Liu, the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom had led six warriors and advanced rapidly. Although Luo Zheng and Randy set off first, they did not pursue speed. So after a while, Fredric Liu overtook them.</p>

  <p>Fredric Liu glanced at Luo Zheng as he passed him by. He didn't pause even for a moment and continued flying forward.</p>

  <p>"Fredric's hidden talent is also extremely powerful. I have not seen him fight for seven or eight years. According to my estimate his strength is not inferior to Fiona's," Randy warned Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Randy was confident that Luo Zheng could defeat Fredric Liu. After all, even the little monster was no match for Luo Zheng. Furthermore, he had withstood every single punch of War Emperor York. No matter how terrifying Fredric Liu's talent was, it would be difficult for him to fight Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng acknowledged this with a slight nod and continued moving ahead steadily, staying behind Randy.</p>

  <p>As they went deeper and deeper into the Feather Holy Sea, the impact of the blood sacrifice power became greater and greater. Everyone's flying altitude also became lower and lower.</p>

  <p>This was because everyone had swallowed the blood of the Genuine Dragon, and was able to counteract a small amount of the blood sacrifice power. Otherwise, the vast majority of warriors would have been pulled into the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>After they had traveled for a dozen miles or so, Randy, Camilla and Renzo found it difficult to maintain their altitude, only flying close to the surface of the sea, except Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We can't maintain the previous speed now. Everyone, come down. If we keep moving like this, we'll be pulled down into the sea," instructed Randy as he stopped and took out a small boat from his space ring. It seemed that the boat was made of a sheet of paper. There were lots of divine textures drawn on it.</p>

  <p>The divine texture skill of the four divine kingdoms was passed down from the humans of the Upper World. Luo Zheng found that they were familiar, but he was unable to gauge their effects.</p>

  <p>Randy adjusted the paper boat and casually threw it into the Feather Holy Sea. The paper boat instantly expanded in the wind and quickly turned from a small piece of paper to a huge ship that was over a hundred feet long.</p>

  <p>This large ship was covered in wonderful lights. It was extremely exquisite, as if it was a ship for an immortal.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's curious gaze, Randy laughed. "This paper boat is a sacred weapon. Although it's a top-grade sacred weapon, it can only be used to carry people. It doesn't have any other function..."</p>

  <p>"It must have been passed down from the Upper World, right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, only the weapon refiners of the Upper World are willing to spend their time creating this kind of weapon," Randy explained amicably.</p>

  <p>The resources of the Lower World were scarce. So the weapon refiners usually only forged powerful, heavy-duty weapons. They would rarely spend their cultivation methods on auxiliary weapons. This was evident in Fiona's jade bracelet.</p>

  <p>Camilla was the first to climb aboard the boat after Randy finished speaking. She had mastered a bit of the Time Law, which made her stronger, but her strength was still a bit inferior to that of Renzo and Barry. She was about to get pulled down by the blood sacrifice power.</p>

  <p>After that, Barry and Renzo jumped onto the boat, followed by Randy and Luo Zheng. When everyone was settled in, the paper boat sailed forward steadily.</p>

  <p>The pull of the blood sacrifice power was much less on Luo Zheng than that on other warriors, perhaps it was because of the Genuine Dragon's blood essence. Luo Zheng was confident that he could cross the Feather Holy Sea even if he didn't stay on the paper boat.</p>

  <p>Other than Zheng's group, the other teams brought out all sorts of magic weapons. Some were large ships, some were light boats, and there were even two houses floating above the pale golden sea.</p>

  <p>This paper boat was truly worthy of being a top-grade sacred weapon. It cut through the waves at an incomparably fast speed. It continued sailing on high speed for six hours.</p>

  <p>The sun gradually set and the sky darkened. A huge island appeared in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the sky and was about to speak when he realized that he might be able to search his memories for information on this island. He did not say anything and instead began searching his mind.</p>

  <p>He had heard Francis describe the four secret lands, and Randy had also told him about the distribution of these lands. But what he saw with his own eyes would be a bit different from what others described.</p>

  <p>The Feather Emperor Secret Land, the Mysterious Dream Secret Land, and the Divine Emperor Secret Land were all located on three islands.</p>

  <p>These memories helped Luo Zheng come to the conclusion that the Feather Emperor Secret Land was located on the island in front of him.</p>

  <p>The closer the paper boat got to the island in front of them, the greater the pressure of the blood sacrifice power got. Although most of the blood sacrifice power had been offset through the sacrificial ceremony, the remaining power of the blood sacrifice could still cause trouble to the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>After a while, the paper boat slowly approached the shore. Randy was the first to jump off the boat.</p>

  <p>Camilla, too, jumped onto the shore. However, she was unsteady on her feet and was about to fall.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to fall, Luo Zheng arrived and reached out to support her.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" Camilla smiled sweetly. Luo Zheng glanced at her indifferently and nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult for a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior to fly on this island. Randy's life vitality flashed gently in his hand and suddenly shot towards the paper boat. It spun for a moment, then quickly shrunk to become pocket-sized and flew back into Randy's hand.</p>

  <p>He looked at the forest on the island trying to orient himself. Then he commanded, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, many warriors entered the forest.</p>

  <p>Once entering the forest, Randy became extremely cautious. As he moved, he started to count in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Sweet little Randy, what are you counting?" Camilla asked with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>Randy concentrated on counting, "Three hundred and thirty-six, three hundred and thirty-seven..."</p>

  <p>Except for Randy, it was the first time that Luo Zheng, Renzo, Camilla, and Barry had explored the Feather Holy Sea. They were all perplexed by Randy's behavior.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred and ninety...</p>

  <p>Four hundred!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly stopped and said to Camilla, "We have entered the Slow Arrow Area."</p>

  <p>"Slow Arrow Area?" Camilla was thoroughly confused now.</p>

  <p id="top_4">Randy nodded as he replied, "Yes. That is an extremely slow arrow.</p>

  <p>Everyone, be careful."</p>

  <p>Everyone was still baffled as to what exactly this Slow Arrow Area was.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Randy took the lead, a series of sounds erupted. A row of numerous arrows appeared in front of them!</p>

  <p>Every single arrow was flashing with a blue light. It was possible that they were highly toxic!</p>

  <p>Toxic arrows were very common, but the weird thing about these was that their speed was very slow. They were slower than the walking speed of an ordinary person!</p>
