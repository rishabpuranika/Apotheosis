</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's palm met Lathrop's, the poisonous miasma on the latter's palm disintegrated.</p>

  <p>The great force spread along Lathrop's arm, turning it into powder...</p>

  <p>Although Lathrop had known that he couldn't defeat Luo Zheng, he hadn't expected that the gap between them would be so huge.</p>

  <p>He had once seized an opportunity to compete with a consummate True God of a powerful clan on the Floating Island. Although he had lost, he had not suffered a crushing defeat like this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's palm strike was beyond anything he could have imagined.</p>

  <p>While Lathrop stood frozen in shock, Luo Zheng quickly shifted forward and struck Lathrop's belly with his other hand.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, it could be very difficult for a consummate True God to kill another consummate True God. Even if their strengths varied, both of them would be able to move in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was worried that if he let Lathrop escape now, it would be troublesome to chase him through the space channel. Although he was sure that he could catch Lathrop no matter what, it would still be a waste of his time. As such, it was infinitely better for him to not give Lathrop the chance to even think about his next move at all.</p>

  <p>The force of this strike seemed to be gentle, but it was enough to destroy Lathrop's inner world.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, Lathrop's inner world shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>He had cultivated the Great Dominance Technique, which didn't have a combat power as good as other skills. However, the structure of his inner world was extremely perfect. Now, as it disintegrated, trillions of secondary creatures died.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struck him once again with his palm, this time sending him flying back right into the tablet of the Life Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablets in the divine land were said to be incomparably sturdy. Now, Lathrop had proof that that was true.</p>

  <p>When his physical body hit the Godly Way Tablet, all the bones in his body broke. He sat on the ground, paralyzed.</p>

  <p>However, something miraculous happened then: the tablet of the Life Godly Way released a strong and powerful life force that infiltrated Lathrop's body.</p>

  <p>His wounds healed in the blink of an eye, and even his arm, which had been smashed into powder by Luo Zheng, instantly recovered.</p>

  <p>However, his inner world seemed to be gone for good.</p>

  <p>The master of the Mo Clan, who was not far away, watched these events unfold with a racing heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Lathrop were both consummate True Gods, so how could the gap between them be so large? Lathrop hadn't been able to resist Luo Zheng's attacks at all...</p>

  <p>The members of the Cyan Tree Clan were equally shocked at the scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepping forward to fight Lathrop had already made them wild with joy. They had never thought that he could easily defeat Lathrop with just two palm strikes, as if Lathrop was just a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Who on earth was this mysterious young man?</p>

  <p>Losing one's inner world meant losing one's cultivation base. Although Lathrop's soul was still powerful, without the support of the internal momentum, he was unable to use the Great Dominance Technique anymore.</p>

  <p>Plop, plop...</p>

  <p>The thirteen poisonous warriors who had been manipulated by Lathrop all dropped down from the sky like flies.</p>

  <p>Lathrop remained on the ground near the Godly Way Tablet without making any attempt to flee.</p>

  <p>He was seriously injured, so it was impossible for him to escape from Luo Zheng's hands anyway. However, he stared at Luo Zheng with ferocious eyes.</p>

  <p>He still couldn't understand why Luo Zheng had attacked him like this.</p>

  <p>Now that the poisonous warriors had been freed, some of them gradually returned to their senses and rose up from the ground, feeling confused.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with me? Why am I here?"</p>

  <p>"It's that man!"</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods seemed to be clueless about where they were or what they were doing, but all of them couldn't help shuddering when they saw Lathrop.</p>

  <p>The miserable experience of being captured by Lathrop and refined into a poisonous warrior was still vivid in their mind. However, everything that had happened since then was a blank to them.</p>

  <p>Lucille was the last one to wake up.</p>

  <p>She didn't know the other Godly Geniuses' situations, but she was sure that she was the most unlucky one among them.</p>

  <p>Just after she had succeeded in sneaking into the divine land, she had almost been caught by a giant hand that had appeared in the sky suddenly. Although she had narrowly escaped, she had unexpectedly gotten involved in a clan's internal strife and had been chased.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she had managed to get rid of the people chasing her, and then joined the Wisteria Clan in the Grace Region, which was a powerful first-tier clan in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of her outstanding talent, she had quickly gained a foothold in the Wisteria Clan, and for a time, she had attracted the attention of a consummate True God in the Wisteria Clan and gotten preferential treatment.</p>

  <p>Over just a short period of time, she had become a top-rank True God as everyone had expected.</p>

  <p>However, one day, when she had been going about her business, she had encountered Lathrop, who had taken her away and refined her into a poisonous warrior. She could not remember anything that had happened since then.</p>

  <p>As soon as she opened her eyes and saw Lathrop, fear filled her face.</p>

  <p>But then, she saw a familiar figure standing next to her.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>It had been years since she saw Luo Zheng last time. Moreover, his temperament had changed greatly after he had stepped into the consummation of True God Realm. He was so different that she almost didn't dare to recognize him!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled at Lucille.</p>

  <p>"Are you really Luo Zheng?" she asked again, still not able to believe it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "Yes, I'm indeed Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>For a moment, Lucille was stunned, but then tears welled up in her eyes, and she bit her lips to keep the tears from falling.</p>

  <p>Even though Lucille was an ace talent in the divine land, she had never experienced such hardships before entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even before being refined into a poisonous person, she had thought that she would die soon.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had never expected to see Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Now that he was in front of her, she was so excited that she rushed to him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>But just when she was a step away from him, she suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Judging by how careful Lathrop had been when refining her and the other poisonous warriors, she guessed that she would possibly hurt Luo Zheng if she touched him while being covered with deadly poison.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng gently pulled her into his arms without any scruples.</p>

  <p>The past few years had been rough on Lucille. Although she was a strong-minded person, she couldn't help but burst out crying like a child at this moment.</p>

  <p>When Lathrop, who was leaning against the Godly Way Tablet, saw this scene, the corner of his eyes couldn't help twitching.</p>

  <p>"So the enmity between us is all because of this little girl?" Lathrop asked.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, these top-rank True Gods were just puppets who would be replaced within a year or so.</p>

  <p>There were only a few consummate True Gods in the divine land, but there was no shortage of ordinary True Gods here. It was a piece of cake for him to capture such True Gods and refine them into poisonous warriors. He had never taken them seriously or even thought of them as sentient beings.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Does it surprise you?" Luo Zheng asked in reply.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Lathrop's face. "It's really unexpected..."</p>

  <p>"How should I deal with him?" Ignoring Lathrop, Luo Zheng turned to ask for Lucille's advice.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Lucille said coldly. She had become much calmer after seeing Lathrop sitting helplessly on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Kill this vicious guy!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better draw out his soul for refining!"</p>

  <p>The other top-rank True Gods who had been refined into poisonous warriors also chimed in, their voices filled with anger and resentment.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly appearing above Lathrop, Luo Zheng looked down at him and said, "I don't have much interest in extracting and refining your soul, but I'm proficient in certain methods of torturing a soul. If you cooperate with me and hand over the method of detoxification, then I'll grant you a less painful death."</p>
