<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2589 Jerome's Defeat </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jerome fell quickly from midair with unparalleled momentum in the blade.</p>

  <p>He found that Luo Zheng wanted to fight fire with more fire? a strange look flashed in his eyes until he replaced it with a sneer at the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p>'If so, you are doomed to lose, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng defeated his sister effortlessly, making Jerome a little more nervous than he initially was.</p>

  <p>Lisa's ability to control wide spaces was quite a formidable one. After transforming herself into ten thousand feet tall, she could still control space perfectly while simultaneously manipulating her sword skillfully.</p>

  <p>Such an ability could actually restrain Jerome's large-scale attack.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't fight him face to face and instead trapped him little by little as Lisa did, the likeliness of Jerome's defeat would've proved to be overwhelming.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Zheng was confronting toughness with toughness, Jerome had a feeling that his victory was in sight.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later?</p>

  <p>Jerome struck Luo Zheng's sword with the weight of insanely great power.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The two forces converged.</p>

  <p>'The strength of this guy?' Jerome thought.</p>

  <p>He looked incredulously at Luo Zheng as he hacked his sword down.</p>

  <p>The power from Luo Zheng's seemingly unremarkable green sword was no weaker than his own.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The cracking sound quickly spread and the originally leveled deserted land was suddenly torn apart layer by layer until the skeletons that had been piling up finally shot out in all directions, much like sharp arrows.</p>

  <p>After wielding the sword, Luo Zheng retreated about eight steps, creating eight giant footprints in the ground.</p>

  <p>From where he was floating midair, Jerome was thrown tens of thousands of feet away. With a somersault, he managed to land on his feet and take several steps back to steady his balance.</p>

  <p>Anyone with a discerning eye could see which of the two was stronger in this competition of strength.</p>

  <p>Many people were aware of Jerome's great power and overbearing sword skills.</p>

  <p>They figured that if Luo Zheng faced Jerome one on one, he, along with his sword, would be cut in half. But the scene before them had completely gone beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>"What? This man has forced Jerome back with his strength alone?"</p>

  <p>"He has mastered sword skills to this extent. In this respect, he's definitely not Lisa's inferior and he is by no means weaker than Jerome."</p>

  <p>"That's freaking powerful?"</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods watching the fight from a distance were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The sects following the Yellow Emperor race had thought that the latter would definitely take over the Sky South Bone Tower, but now, it seemed that the young man from the Nine Li race had the power to determine the final result? one could imagine the shift in their mood because of this unexpected factor.</p>

  <p>"Haha! The Nine Li race is quite impressive!"</p>

  <p>"This young man will definitely bring the Nine Li race's rank up high in the future!"</p>

  <p>"I don't even know his name yet?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Wild Gods who followed the Nine Li race were laughing heartily.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, seeing how the disciples of the Nine Li race were defeated one after another by the Yellow Emperor race, they were rather dejected.</p>

  <p>But just when they had almost lost all hope and begun pondering on where they would go after leaving the Flying Sickle City, Luo Zheng's current performance rekindled the flames of hope in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Impressive. I didn't expect you to be so powerful as well. Let's press on!"</p>

  <p>Bright fires seemed to blaze in Jerome's eyes? his will to fight was highly aroused.</p>

  <p>An even more powerful force burst from his body.</p>

  <p>"Thump! Thump! Thump!"</p>

  <p>In the deserted land, he strode toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, Jerome activated the Wild God Power completely? it emitted a bright golden light, making him appear like a walking sun, too dazzling to be stared at directly.</p>

  <p>His broadsword grated against the ground, leaving a deep trace.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Heaven Breaking Slash!"</p>

  <p>The sharp blade poured towards Luo Zheng from the ground to right in front of him.</p>

  <p>He grew more cautious about Jerome's second attack.</p>

  <p>It was without a doubt much more powerful than the first one.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no intention of retreating.</p>

  <p>With a single thought, the nine stars in his body began spinning.</p>

  <p>This time, he intended to unleash the Wild God Power and the strength source at the same time.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power was based on the body, while the strength source relied on the inner world. As the two different forces worked simultaneously, Luo Zheng's body emitted an indescribable aura.</p>

  <p>Adele, Giacomo, Erik, and the other elders in the distance turned visibly pale.</p>

  <p>They were all satisfied with Luo Zheng's progress in the past three months. His performance was by no means inferior to that of any talent from their race.</p>

  <p>With all the wild bones he had absorbed and his raw talent, Luo Zheng improved rapidly.</p>

  <p>But somehow, the power that suddenly erupted from his body gave them an odd feeling.</p>

  <p>It was a tremendous force.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Luo Zheng, a mid-rank Wild God, to use it unless he underwent the Body Tribulations again and became a top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>But the scene before them was unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Even Jerome was shocked at the scene.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng unleashed this power, Jerome knew that he had already lost.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to defeat such a powerful monster.</p>

  <p>His strength was simply not on the same level as Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Like his sister, Jerome was a person who maintained his principles.</p>

  <p>Even in inevitable defeat, he was a man of principle.</p>

  <p>Jerome wouldn't stop so long as he still had moves to make.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The earsplitting sound spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>The moment the two fought, the stones and dust on the ground rose ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>Even as the two stood ten thousand feet tall, the dust seemed to submerge them.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the dusk billowed, a huge figure flew back.</p>

  <p>Soon, it passed through the dust and heavily hit the ground, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>And this man was none other than Jerome.</p>

  <p>To no one's surprise, he was defeated in the second fight of strength.</p>

  <p>This time, his loss was completely unquestionable.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, an enormous blade of seven to eight thousand feet in length swirled out from the dust rapidly until it was buried in the wasteland on Jerome's side.</p>

  <p>Without the infusion of the Wild God Power, the broadsword entered the ground and quickly shrank back to its original state.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes darted to and rested on Jerome for a moment until their gazes once again shifted to the billowing dust.</p>

  <p>After the dust dissipated, Luo Zheng's body came into sight.</p>

  <p>Half of his body stood in a large pit. With the green sword still in his grasp, he looked calmly at Jerome from a distance.</p>

  <p>The latter stood slowly from the ground, wearing a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng defeated him with some kind of trick, he wouldn't have been so embarrassed.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng chose to fight him totally head-on and defeated him? Jerome had never felt so humiliated.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he wasn't a narrow-minded man. After a moment of sulking, he got himself back up. In the world, there would always be someone out there who surpassed him? Jerome knew this to be true for everyone. He just had to admit that Luo Zheng was such a person.</p>

  <p>Comforting himself in his heart, he let out a long breath. He then cupped his hands in the air, directed them at Luo Zheng and called out, "You have proven to be far superior in terms of skill. I'm willing to accept defeat. I have lost!"</p>
