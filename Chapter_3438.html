  <p>As soon as the little monsters calmed down, Zheng couldn't help but be amazed.</p>

  <p>After all, the little monsters imprisoned him, fought with those double-headed flying snakes, and then finally sent him to this place.</p>

  <p>Did that mean they wanted those brown beads all along?</p>

  <p>"These little monsters… Are they the aboriginals of this space?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The handsome man casually nodded and said, "You can say that. They were originally a race in our master's inner world.</p>

  <p>After our master took up this space, he released them."</p>

  <p>The little monsters were from the inner world of the man's master?!</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng was utterly surprised. How powerful was their master, really?</p>

  <p>How could the creatures in his inner world be so strong? "How about those double-headed flying snakes then?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"They also came from our master's inner world," the handsome man answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>The man's response, however, confused Zheng. "But I saw them fight so fiercely with each other…" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Our master made them fight on purpose," the handsome man explained.</p>

  <p>"He has kept three races in this space. At first, he only kept those double-headed flying snakes, but eventually, they were all over the space. So, he had no choice but to introduce the other two races. When the three races are under checks and balances, their numbers can be limited."</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng nodded and asked No. 9527 in his mind, "Didn't you say that some Chaos Ancient God controlled this space?"</p>

  <p>He just realized that the man's answer completely contradicted what No. 9527 had said before.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was also confused. In the end, it could only say, "You can ask the Regal Jade Spirit. Maybe he knows about it."</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit represented the Regal Jade Civilization, and the Regal Jade Civilization had occupied almost the whole entirety of the chaos. He himself had once been a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, No. 9527 just said that the handsome man'master was from the 77th civilization, while the Regal Jade Civilization was the 749th civilization. Thus, it was more likely that the Regal Jade Civilization should have known some things about this space.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed the handsome man into the door and they walked along a lengthy, narrowly spaced channel. He decided to take advantage of this opportunity to send his incarnation into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng had specially created a space in order to make the Regal Jade Spirit teach Geoffrey genuinely and wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>That space was very quiet, as only Geoffrey and the Regal Jade Spirit could come and go freely within it.</p>

  <p>In an open yard, the Regal Jade Spirit sat upright while Geoffrey crossed his legs and meditated with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Some cyan lights spiraled up behind Geoffrey and turned into an exquisite jade lotus. The lotus quietly moved in a spiral motion as the surface of Geoffrey's body became emerald green.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng's incarnation entered the space, the Regal Jade Spirit had sensed it.</p>

  <p>"Master Regal Jade," Zheng greeted as he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit nodded in response and said, "Geoffrey's talent is really extraordinary. He has already reached the third level of the body refining cultivation method I chose for him, in just a short period of time."</p>

  <p>As a ruling force, the Regal Jade Civilization had created countless theurgies.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, the Regal Jade Spirit was worried that it would be difficult for Geoffrey to cultivate the theurgies of the Regal Jade Civilization. After all, there were gaps between different races, and the bodies of the Regal Jade creatures were greatly different from those of other races.</p>

  <p>Yet, Geoffrey unexpectedly practiced so smoothly.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's gaze swept over Geoffrey, who was focused on cultivation. The emerald green light that emerged from his body was extremely stable. Although his body was not as strong as Zheng's own, it was already quite impressive for him to have reached such a level.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was too concentrated on his cultivation, so he didn't notice Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>"With your teachings, of course Geoffrey can make great progress.</p>

  <p>But I came here for something else," Zheng said. "What's it?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I have found the second flaw of the Ways-blending Energy," Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"What? You have found it? What is the flaw? Are you sure you are not wrong?" Needless to say, the Regal Jade Spirit was stunned.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm wrong. It's an arc light similar to the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>He also mainly cultivates the Ways-blending Energy and has integrated the arc light into the energy," Zheng continued and shook his head. "Have you got the arc light then?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>It was known to all that the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization had put a great deal of effort into practicing the Blood Essence Godly Way. He had spent so much time and had gone through countless challenges.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Zheng discovered the second flaw. It was indeed too shocking, so the Regal Jade Spirit couldn't help but be excited.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Zheng said with a complicated look in his eyes. "I was exiled to a space when I was in the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>"Exiled? It's nothing," said the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "It is a space that has been deleted," he elaborated.</p>

  <p>After the Regal Jade Spirit heard Zheng's words, his complacency was gone.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that you have been deleted by a Son of Truth and exiled to the outside of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>A helpless smile graced the Regal Jade Spirit's face. "What a coincidence!</p>

  <p>When I was still a Son of Truth, I had grasped the space truth," he commented.</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng exclaimed as his eyebrows shot up to his forehead. "Is there any way to go back?"</p>

  <p>Now, he was not interested in the secret of the space at all.</p>

  <p>He only wanted to return to the Chaotic Source World as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>"If I was still the Son of Truth, I could help you go back. Alas, there is no chance for you to go back unless the Chaos Ancient God who exiled you is willing to let you go," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>Mount was the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God. With his current abilities, he could exile Zheng, but he might not be able to bring him back. Moreover, Zheng couldn't possibly pin his hopes on his opponent.</p>

  <p>When the Regal Jade Spirit saw the faint disappointment on Zheng's face, he continued, "Although this space looks empty, I'd exiled countless creatures to this place before--including a few races that resisted the Regal Jade Civilization, some unpredictable threats, and the energy crystals that might explode at any time."</p>

  <p>"Empty?" Zheng looked at the Regal Jade Spirit with an indecipherable look.</p>

  <p>The void was not empty. All kinds of dead bodies were interwoven in it together, like a huge garbage station.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit also noticed the way Zheng looked and asked, "Did I say anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Numerous dead bodies of creatures, rocks and soil, and other things are floating in the space," Zheng replied. "No way!" the Regal Jade Spirit refuted him.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was very familiar with the empty space.</p>

  <p>"If things are exiled to this space, they will be deleted once and for all after some time. If they, both the living things and corpses, are not retrieved, they will completely disappear. How can it be like what you said? Take me there!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the Regal Jade Spirit's reaction, Zheng realized that the Regal Jade Spirit, who used to be the Son of Truth, probably did not know about the change in the space.</p>
