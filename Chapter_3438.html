</p>

  <p>As soon as the little monsters calmed down, Luo Zheng couldn't help but be amazed.</p>

  <p>After all, the little monsters imprisoned him, fought with those double-headed flying snakes, and then finally sent him to this place.</p>

  <p>Did that mean they wanted those brown beads all along?</p>

  <p>"These little monsters? Are they the aboriginals of this space?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The handsome man casually nodded and said, "You can say that. They were originally a race in our master's inner world.</p>

  <p>After our master took up this space, he released them."</p>

  <p>The little monsters were from the inner world of the man's master?!</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng was utterly surprised. How powerful was their master, really?</p>

  <p>How could the creatures in his inner world be so strong? "How about those double-headed flying snakes then?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"They also came from our master's inner world," the handsome man answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>The man's response, however, confused Luo Zheng. "But I saw them fight so fiercely with each other?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Our master made them fight on purpose," the handsome man explained.</p>

  <p>"He has kept three races in this space. At first, he only kept those double-headed flying snakes, but eventually, they were all over the space. So, he had no choice but to introduce the other two races. When the three races are under checks and balances, their numbers can be limited."</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng nodded and asked No. 9527 in his mind, "Didn't you say that some Chaos Ancient God controlled this space?"</p>

  <p>He just realized that the man's answer completely contradicted what No. 9527 had said before.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was also confused. In the end, it could only say, "You can ask the Green Jade Spirit. Maybe he knows about it."</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit represented the Green Jade Civilization, and the Green Jade Civilization had occupied almost the whole entirety of the chaos. He himself had once been a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, No. 9527 just said that the handsome man'master was from the 77th civilization, while the Green Jade Civilization was the 749th civilization. Thus, it was more likely that the Green Jade Civilization should have known some things about this space.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed the handsome man into the door and they walked along a lengthy, narrowly spaced channel. He decided to take advantage of this opportunity to send his incarnation into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng had specially created a space in order to make the Green Jade Spirit teach Luo Nian genuinely and wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>That space was very quiet, as only Luo Nian and the Green Jade Spirit could come and go freely within it.</p>

  <p>In an open yard, the Green Jade Spirit sat upright while Luo Nian crossed his legs and meditated with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Some cyan lights spiraled up behind Luo Nian and turned into an exquisite jade lotus. The lotus quietly moved in a spiral motion as the surface of Luo Nian's body became emerald green.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's incarnation entered the space, the Green Jade Spirit had sensed it.</p>

  <p>"Master Green Jade," Luo Zheng greeted as he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit nodded in response and said, "Luo Nian's talent is really extraordinary. He has already reached the third level of the body refining cultivation method I chose for him, in just a short period of time."</p>

  <p>As a ruling force, the Green Jade Civilization had created countless theurgies.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, the Green Jade Spirit was worried that it would be difficult for Luo Nian to cultivate the theurgies of the Green Jade Civilization. After all, there were gaps between different races, and the bodies of the Green Jade creatures were greatly different from those of other races.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Nian unexpectedly practiced so smoothly.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's gaze swept over Luo Nian, who was focused on cultivation. The emerald green light that emerged from his body was extremely stable. Although his body was not as strong as Luo Zheng's own, it was already quite impressive for him to have reached such a level.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was too concentrated on his cultivation, so he didn't notice Luo Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>"With your teachings, of course Luo Nian can make great progress.</p>

  <p>But I came here for something else," Luo Zheng said. "What's it?" the Green Jade Spirit asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I have found the second flaw of the Ways-blending Energy," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"What? You have found it? What is the flaw? Are you sure you are not wrong?" Needless to say, the Green Jade Spirit was stunned.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm wrong. It's an arc light similar to the Thunderstorm Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>He also mainly cultivates the Ways-blending Energy and has integrated the arc light into the energy," Luo Zheng continued and shook his head. "Have you got the arc light then?" the Green Jade Spirit asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>It was known to all that the Wing King of the Green Jade Civilization had put a great deal of effort into practicing the Blood Essence Divine Dao. He had spent so much time and had gone through countless challenges.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Luo Zheng discovered the second flaw. It was indeed too shocking, so the Green Jade Spirit couldn't help but be excited.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Luo Zheng said with a complicated look in his eyes. "I was exiled to a space when I was in the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>"Exiled? It's nothing," said the Green Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "It is a space that has been deleted," he elaborated.</p>

  <p>After the Green Jade Spirit heard Luo Zheng's words, his complacency was gone.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that you have been deleted by a Son of Truth and exiled to the outside of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>A helpless smile graced the Green Jade Spirit's face. "What a coincidence!</p>

  <p>When I was still a Son of Truth, I had grasped the space truth," he commented.</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng exclaimed as his eyebrows shot up to his forehead. "Is there any way to go back?"</p>

  <p>Now, he was not interested in the secret of the space at all.</p>

  <p>He only wanted to return to the Chaotic Source World as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>"If I was still the Son of Truth, I could help you go back. Alas, there is no chance for you to go back unless the Chaos Ancient God who exiled you is willing to let you go," the Green Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>Mount was the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God. With his current abilities, he could exile Luo Zheng, but he might not be able to bring him back. Moreover, Luo Zheng couldn't possibly pin his hopes on his opponent.</p>

  <p>When the Green Jade Spirit saw the faint disappointment on Luo Zheng's face, he continued, "Although this space looks empty, I'd exiled countless creatures to this place before--including a few races that resisted the Green Jade Civilization, some unpredictable threats, and the energy crystals that might explode at any time."</p>

  <p>"Empty?" Luo Zheng looked at the Green Jade Spirit with an indecipherable look.</p>

  <p>The void was not empty. All kinds of dead bodies were interwoven in it together, like a huge garbage station.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit also noticed the way Luo Zheng looked and asked, "Did I say anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Numerous dead bodies of creatures, rocks and soil, and other things are floating in the space," Luo Zheng replied. "No way!" the Green Jade Spirit refuted him.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit was very familiar with the empty space.</p>

  <p>"If things are exiled to this space, they will be deleted once and for all after some time. If they, both the living things and corpses, are not retrieved, they will completely disappear. How can it be like what you said? Take me there!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the Green Jade Spirit's reaction, Luo Zheng realized that the Green Jade Spirit, who used to be the Son of Truth, probably did not know about the change in the space.</p>
