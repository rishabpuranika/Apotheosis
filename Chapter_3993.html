<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng and his companions were in great trouble at that point. If the Treacherous Being came back to life and couldn't find its thatched hut, it would hunt them down.</p>

  <p>It was most likely that two hundred Treacherous Beings would probably come for them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Treacherous Beings' strengths only gave them a slim chance of survival.</p>

  <p>Had it been one Treacherous Being, perhaps they might still make it.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's idea might work.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you want to fight a Treacherous Being?" Pearson sniffed. "Or what?</p>

  <p>Should we surrender to them instead?" Fuxi asked darkly. "I did not mean to look down on you," Pearson said indifferently. "There was once a race called the Primal Tiger race, in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>They were so powerful that even the Element Spirit Civilization never dared to provoke them. We were lucky enough to befriend them?" he continued.</p>

  <p>Although the Eternal Realm Hunters usually traveled alone, they did have some friends in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Primal Tiger race was on friendly terms with the Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>In the past, when dozens of members of the Primal Tiger race fell into a poisonous well, it was the Eternal Realm Hunters who had saved them.</p>

  <p>Due to immense gratitude, the Primal Tiger race had promised to protect the Eternal Realm Hunters forever.</p>

  <p>After that, the Eternal Realm Hunters turned to the Primal Tiger race whenever they were in peril. That was how they escaped their end several times.</p>

  <p>However, a single Treacherous Being slaughtered such a strong race that not even the Element Spirit Civilization dared to instigate!</p>

  <p>Back then, the Eternal Realm Hunters were also in the tribe of the Primal Tiger race. They didn't take the Treacherous Being seriously at first since they thought that the mighty Primal Tiger race would deal with it.</p>

  <p>Even when the Eye Spirit had personally visited the Primal Tiger race to ask for the Eternal Realm Hunters, they just drove him away. Therefore, who else in the Three Purities Stage posed any threat to them?</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Eternal Realm Hunters found that they were very wrong.</p>

  <p>Simply put, the Treacherous Being's power was far beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Eternal Realm Hunters had only gotten a glimpse of the Treacherous Being. It was a continually changing spirit.</p>

  <p>After the Treacherous Being broke into the tribe, it immediately exploded and unleashed blood-red flames that had spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>As a result, the vast majority of the Primal Tiger race did not have a chance to escape at all, and the red flames swallowed them.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters stayed on the edge of the tribe's territory. When they saw the spread of red flames, they quickly fled into the distance? but the red flames still slaughtered three of them.</p>

  <p>Even though one of the victims had only barely brushed against the flames, he seemed to have suffered the worst curse in the world. His body crumpled, and his soul turned grey. He faded away each passing day. The others infused their life energies into him but to no avail. In the end, he had died miserably after several months of struggle and torture.</p>

  <p>From then on, the Eternal Realm Hunters finally understood the real power of the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>After Pearson finished his story, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, the Snake Goddess, and even Fuxi, all shared dark looks.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi knew that the Treacherous Beings were horrible creatures, but this was beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>"So what should we do? Do we have no chance of survival at all?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>If the Treacherous Beings were surely that powerful, they could not fight back.</p>

  <p>"I don't think all of them are as strong as the one in the story.</p>

  <p>We may still have a way to deal with them," Zheng suddenly said. "What made you think that?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked.</p>

  <p>"Someone must have used a special method to drive that Treacherous Being off and sent it to the Supreme Pure Realm," Zheng said as he pointed at the thatched huts in the distance.</p>

  <p>It was clear that a Treacherous Being in the Whining Road would not leave the place for no reason. Thus, someone must have found a way to lure it to the Supreme Pure Realm. Since someone had managed to do that, they could also deal with a Treacherous Being if they did find a way.</p>

  <p>"I agree. Someone must have driven that Treacherous Being away. If we try, maybe we'll also have a chance," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>Then, Thurston asked, "Zheng, are you sure that Treacherous Being will come back to life tonight?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I'm not completely sure about that. I heard the other Treacherous Beings discuss that they would bring it back to life tonight, but it does not mean that they'll manage to do so," he answered.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his explanation, everyone became hesitant.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the chances of the Treacherous Being's rebirth were not high, but once it came back to life, death and destruction would follow.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if they took the initiative to kill another Treacherous Being first, it was not an easy feat at all. They remained stuck in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Wing King, who usually did not speak much, abruptly said, "Don't pin your hopes on others. Losing the initiative is equivalent to waiting passively to be killed!"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization had placed their hopes on the Nihility race in the past, as they thought that the enemies would pull their punches. In the end, the Regal Jade Civilization had met a tragic end.</p>

  <p>"You're right. Once the night falls, we'll have no more chances to fight back," Fuxi said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, King Ieuan looked at Thurston and Sawyer, then said, "You can summon the powerful Black Sun, right? If you can pull a Treacherous Being into the Black Sun, then killing it won't be that hard, right?"</p>

  <p>It was true that the Black Sun had severe limitations, but it was useful when it came to individual enemies.</p>

  <p>"Well, we can try," Thurston agreed. In fact, he already thought of that idea, and that was why he had asked Zheng the question.</p>

  <p>"Each Treacherous Being has a different level of strength. We still have enough time. We need to find out the easiest opponent," Pearson stated.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, daytime in the Whining Road was twelve hours long, so they had sufficient time to prepare before nightfall.</p>

  <p>Of course, the task of choosing their opponent fell on the Augury Dog, who was the most sensitive to powers.</p>

  <p>He could sense the level of threat of each enemy, which was associated with their strength.</p>

  <p>A few leaves gently rustled on the ground as the Augury Dog ran past each of the thatched huts and sniffed them one by one. Every time he passed by a thatched hut, his eyes became filled with fear. However, he went to the next thatched hut without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he had examined over one hundred thatched huts. When only three huts remained, the Augury Dog stopped before one of the huts and said in a low voice, "This one. This one is the weakest among them all."</p>

  <p>The thatched hut he referred to was isolated from the rest.</p>

  <p>Still, it emanated a threatening aura.</p>

  <p>Then again, it was indeed a little weaker compared to the other Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"Get ready," Fuxi said to the three Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters had decided their divisions of labor.</p>

  <p>Pearson was responsible for subduing the Treacherous Being, while Thurston and Sawyer would pull it into the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>If everything went well, the whole ordeal would only take them a short while.</p>

  <p>Now, the others retreated to a safe distance and formed a circle to deal with emergencies.</p>

  <p>Finally, they shut off their hearing, then Thurston and Sawyer summoned the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>At that point, Pearson turned into a spider web and blocked the front of the thatched hut. "Who will open the thatched hut for us?" Sawyer asked.</p>

  <p>His question met silence. Everyone looked reluctant to do the dangerous task.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," Zheng said in a resolute voice.</p>

  <p>He walked straight to the thatched hut, grabbed a corner of the flap, and slowly lifted it.</p>

  <p>The whole village in the vast, white mist was unusually quiet, to the point that everyone heard their heartbeats clearly.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had lifted more than half of the flap, they all saw a strange thing that lay on the ground.</p>

  <p>It looked like a mass of white liquid, but it had limbs and a head.</p>

  <p>It also had two black hollows on its head. Everyone felt afraid when they looked into the holes.</p>

  <p>"So this is a Treacherous Being..."</p>

  <p>"Is it asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Its aura feels depressing..."</p>

  <p>Without the thatched hut as a barrier, they were now face to face with the Treacherous Being. The air around it felt so uncomfortable, and it overwhelmed them even more.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the Treacherous Being was the nemesis of all living beings.</p>

  <p>They couldn't help but feel instinctively fearful in front of it.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a few steps back and nodded at the Eternal Realm Hunters, which signaled them to get started.</p>
