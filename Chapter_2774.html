<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2774 The Beasts Courting Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Samuel had already expected that Nicholas would ask him such a question, so he merely smiled and said, "Do you know why I chased after Luo Zheng even though he didn't do anything to me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't know why," Nicholas said in an impatient tone, shaking his head with displeasure.</p>

  <p>He had specially made an exception to allow Samuel to join the alliance of powerful clans and explore the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel had run away from the Desperation Plain without obeying his words, so Nicholas was extremely dissatisfied with him.</p>

  <p>Samuel answered calmly, "My two daughters became friends with Luo Zheng when they were on the Floating Island. Since they followed him just now, as their father, I couldn't turn a blind eye to that."</p>

  <p>Nicholas and the other Holy Beings were also aware that Aleyna and Liusu were acquainted with Luo Zheng, so Samuel's explanation sounded reasonable to them.</p>

  <p>But it still didn't explain everything.</p>

  <p>"I see. Where are your daughters? Did you see Jayden, Raymond and Mathew?" Nicholas asked.</p>

  <p>A trace of worry appeared on Samuel's face. "I went all the way to the black water area but I only found my son, Pascal. Luo Zheng, my two daughters, and the three Demi-holy Beings were all gone. I asked Pascal what happened and he said that all of them dived into the dark water..." Samuel turned his head and shouted, "Pascal! Report everything you saw to Holy Nicholas. Don't hide anything!"</p>

  <p>Pascal quickly walked out from the group of consummate True Gods and bowed to Nicholas. In a tone that showed that he had prepared his answer in advance, he quickly described what had happened in the dark water.</p>

  <p>He repeated Samuel's words, and then told a made-up story that the three Demi-holy Beings had chased Luo Zheng into the dark water and that he didn't know whether they were alive or dead.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is an area of dark water on the other side of the Desperation Plain..."</p>

  <p>Nicholas murmured as he pondered over Pascal's words. He believed everything he had just heard.</p>

  <p>Anyway, since it seemed that three Demi-holy Beings had died in the dark water, Luo Zheng, who had fled into that place, would have a bad ending as well.</p>

  <p>"Humph, let's ignore that brat for now. He has always been lucky, but this time, he won't be able to escape. Once we take control of the Abyss Demon Region, he won't be able to survive!" Murphy said, his eyes filled with hatred.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Murphy blamed Luo Zheng for Mathew's death.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Nicholas no longer blamed him, Samuel breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>During the battle on the Desperation Plain, the alliance of powerful clans hadn't suffered a great loss. Apart from Jayden, Mathew, and Raymond, only two consummate True Gods from the alliance had been killed. The fiends had not been as menacing as the alliance had expected them to be.</p>

  <p>After passing through the Desperation Plain, they found that there were still endless brown mountains on both sides.</p>

  <p>There were round volcanic vents at the peak of some of the mountains, spurting flames.</p>

  <p>Some strange birds were crouching on both sides of the mountain range, staring at the people flying by.</p>

  <p>These birds looked weak and they didn't seem to pose any threat at all, but their cold stares made everyone feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>"The way these birds are looking at us is so annoying! Burn!"</p>

  <p>Feeling annoyed, Clark waved his hands at the strange birds on both sides.</p>

  <p>Flames began to spread out on the mountains on both sides.</p>

  <p>The birds quickly caught on fire, and in no time, their flesh and bones were burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that when some of the birds began burning, the other birds didn't try to escape. They just continued to stare at the crowd with a cold stare even as the flames spread toward them and completely devoured them.</p>

  <p>"These birds are so strange..."</p>

  <p>"Even if they are not afraid of death, how can they stay so still? They are not living creatures, right?"</p>

  <p>"They must be alive!"</p>

  <p>Everyone had always known that the environment of the Abyss Demon Region was very strange, but upon seeing this scene, they felt a deep discomfort.</p>

  <p>Just then, a stranger scene greeted them.</p>

  <p>The flames Clark had started only spread for a few miles and didn't manage to burn all the birds.</p>

  <p>And the surviving birds began to fly toward the crowd one by one!</p>

  <p>"Are these birds trying to court death?"</p>

  <p>The outermost Demi-holy Being frowned. He drew his fingers together and lightly slashed through the air. A ray of sword light shot out from his fingertips into the sky and swiftly danced in the air.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>All the strange birds that were flying toward them were crushed to pieces by the Demi-holy Being, turning into a bloody rain as they fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"These strange birds just dug their own grave," said Clark while frowning.</p>

  <p>Clark liked to conquer everything with absolute power. What he hated the most was things like this, when he couldn't see through a situation.</p>

  <p>Nicholas raised his eyebrows slightly; something seemed to have occurred to him. "These strange birds were indeed courting death, just like Gallio and the fiends he led."</p>

  <p>Murphy and the other Holy Beings also realized something after hearing Nicholas's words.</p>

  <p>"You're right... I think that those fiends led by Gallio were indeed courting death!"</p>

  <p>"That's true. Those fiends were far from as powerful as we thought!"</p>

  <p>"Still, why did they want to die like that?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings felt like they had almost grasped the string of a kite but let it go at the last moment; after hearing this question, they were left feeling confused once again.</p>

  <p>After all, they were not monsters from the Abyss Demon Region, so they couldn't figure out the thought process of the beasts in this forbidden land.</p>

  <p>After the strange birds were all killed, the surroundings finally became silent for a while, but this silence remained for less than three minutes.</p>

  <p>After they had only walked for dozens of miles, the mountains on both sides suddenly began to shake.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Wisps of fire light spread out from the back of the mountain range like a continuous fire cloud.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God with sharp eyes was the first to recognize the strange beast nearby. In a rather strange tone, he said, "The Flame War Horse... It is a kind of low-level monster. Are we really in the sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>It was very common for the Flame War Horses to be seen in the first stage of the Abyss Demon Region. The consummate True Gods had often slaughtered such beasts, and some people had even tamed them. However, these Flame War Horses couldn't be taken out of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they would be spotted on the Floating Islands of rich clans.</p>

  <p>"Are they... courting death as well?" Clark's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no idea that the transmission gate at the entrance of the sixth stage had been recovered. There were massive monsters surging out of the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>Leland and several top-rank True Gods were at a loss as they watched this scene.</p>
