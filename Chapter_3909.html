<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This round of attack was blocked, but Othniel sneered as he said, "Can you block the attack every time?"</p>

  <p>The attacks from Othniel and Herbert were mainly aimed at destroying the fragile creatures in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>It was a good idea and was working so far.</p>

  <p>The energy that Yan's Energy Shaft had released was so powerful that even the Chaos Ancient Gods couldn't bear it.</p>

  <p>Only if Othniel and Herbert killed a large number of disciples, sect leaders and mountain leaders in the Pear Hill would Yan's foundation no longer exist.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Five more huge balls appeared before Othniel. Once a large number of space spikes were compressed in the five balls, Othniel gently raised his hand and sent the five balls to the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with this alone!"</p>

  <p>Judson's huge figure flashed above the Pear Hill. He was moving so fast that it gave people whiplash.</p>

  <p>His figure split into five, each figure holding a Heavenly Glazed Goblet in their hands.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>With five cracking sounds, the Heavenly Glazed Goblets caught the balls pretty accurately.</p>

  <p>After the balls exploded, the spikes in the inner part of the balls could do nothing to the Heavenly Glazed Goblets. Judson had single-handedly blocked Othniel's attack.</p>

  <p>When Othniel sensed this, he merely snorted but didn't adjust his methods.</p>

  <p>He still compressed the spikes inside the spheres, and sent them into the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>But no matter how many spheres Othniel sent in, Judson blocked every single one of them.</p>

  <p>In the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess had returned to the jadeite platform, her eyes gloomy.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill had resisted the attacks of the two Chaos Ancient Gods. But this was still way below the Snake Goddess's expectations.</p>

  <p>"Othniel is so irritating! We keep defending the Pear Hill, but he is patient and just won't break in!" the Snake Goddess said, frowning.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill was powerful. The Snake Goddess had arranged a great counterattack method in the Pear Hill to deal with the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>She wanted to see which one of the Gods attacked first.</p>

  <p>Her intuition told her that Othniel would be the first to break in.</p>

  <p>But Othniel wasn't stupid. He did what Herbert had done. He seemed to use formidable methods, but it was all a ruse to stall for time.</p>

  <p>"They want to wait for the members of the Black Ship to make the first move," said Fuxi, looking at the other side. He could clearly see a row of black ships floating in the air through the Cloud Cover Array.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship wanted the Chaos Ancient Gods to make the first move and then intended to reap the benefits. The Chaos Ancient Gods had the same thought.</p>

  <p>This was often the case when three parties competed against each other.</p>

  <p>"Well then. We'll just wait. I'd like to see who is more patient and who buckles first." The Snake Goddess pursed her lips and smiled.</p>

  <p>On the Dark Haze Peak, Zheng could see golden light blades shooting out and exploding in quick succession.</p>

  <p>Yan's strength was so terrifying, and every time a light blade exploded, it shook the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked serious.</p>

  <p>He had just reached the Eternal Realm and couldn't yet control his bloodline.</p>

  <p>The strength he could use in a battle of this level was limited, which annoyed him to no end.</p>

  <p>If the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Grandmaster of Heaven were to really launch a large scale attack on the Pear Hill, Yan, who was in control of the Energy Shaft, would probably be their first target.</p>

  <p>Zheng was worried at this thought.</p>

  <p id="top_3">"I can't use the ancestry-level bloodline. All the changes that the ancestry-level bloodline has made before were only to restrain the external energy to protect itself. I might as well absorb an origin-level bloodline if this is the case," Zheng said, helplessly shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Soon after he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline and when he left the Eternal Divine Courtyard and passed through the spaces, the ancestry-level bloodline seemed to suddenly become generous. It even allowed Zheng to comprehend the structure of the origin-level bloodlines.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could adjust the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline by himself, he could then change it into an origin-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>But ever since he had left the Eternal Scroll Painting, the ancestry-level bloodline had become more and more independent, no longer giving Zheng any rights.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard Zheng's voice, he knew that Zheng was depressed. He was about to persuade Zheng, when Zheng, after having exhausted his Chaotic Source Spirits, sliced through his arm, creating a wound.</p>

  <p>This time, a larger amount of the ancestry-level bloodline was released.</p>

  <p>The surface of the ancestry-level bloodline began to undulate, transforming into the shape of a little monster and roaring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't understand its strange roar, but he still replied seriously, "I don't care what your purpose of hiding in my body is, but I need strength to get through this!"</p>

  <p>He pointed into the distance where three golden light blades exploded in the air. The huge sound waves spread throughout Pear Hill, causing the mountains to sway.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you are safe?" Zheng sneered. "Can you guarantee that there is no member from the Four Spirits Sect behind them? Knowing your base, they would naturally have a way to defeat me and you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng could roughly understand the simple idea of the ancestry-level bloodline. It gave him the ability to protect himself, and could help Zheng subdue everything.</p>

  <p>It wasn't concerned with the powerful strength that Zheng was pursuing.</p>

  <p>"Aww, aww..."</p>

  <p>The fist-sized blood beast was still howling, but its voice grew quieter.</p>

  <p>Zheng was sure that the Four Spirits Sect was the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>However, the Four Spirits Sect was not one whole, so he couldn't figure out what exactly their standpoint was.</p>

  <p>But from what he knew, even the creatures of the Four Spirits Sect were interested in the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"If you help me, they won't catch me. I don't know what will happen if you don't help me," Zheng said, threat evident in his voice.</p>

  <p>He had barely finished speaking when the blood beast roared again. Zheng felt his body stiffen. His blood dragged his legs away, wanting to escape.</p>

  <p>He had just taken a step forward when Zheng himself erupted with power.</p>

  <p>His legs were now tied together, and he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"How can I let you get what you want?" Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>He stood up from the ground as he spoke. Forced by the blood to run forward, he quietly exerted his strength and tripped himself again.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline could only control Zheng's physical body through his blood. But Zheng's body still had bones and meridians.</p>

  <p>He still had the upper hand in the fight for the control of his body.</p>

  <p>Of course, this seemed only a temporary solution. The future was uncertain.</p>

  <p>Zheng was obviously worried about it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it had completely understood Zheng's words, or perhaps it had realized that it couldn't change Zheng's mind for the time being. The little blood beast that was still outside Zheng's body groaned as if begging for mercy, and jumped onto Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>It didn't get in through the wound on Zheng's right arm, but waited for Zheng's permission.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to compromise?" Zheng said, smugly overjoyed. "You should at least let me get an origin-level bloodline theurgy."</p>
