  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow flew over and tried to catch Elvinia in its mouth.</p>

  <p>The sight shocked Flamine but she chose to stand her ground and not do anything yet.</p>

  <p>Zheng's reminder echoed in her mind as she remembered the treasure held by the Star Falcon race of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>She was still a member of the Sun Crow race when she heard about the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. She had only heard of it back then but now, it was right in front of her.</p>

  <p>After it completely swallowed Elvinia, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow bent down low and crawled on the ground.</p>

  <p>In just a few short moments, it let out a long, shrill cry as it beat its wings wildly and leaped.</p>

  <p id="top_21"><a id="p20695" class="calibre2"></a>A giant egg was left from where it once stood.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>There was a series of large cracks as the egg broke into pieces, revealing a very much alive Elvinia.</p>

  <p>With her appearance came the sharp roar of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>One of its eyes had exploded, partially blinding the creature.</p>

  <p>From what Zheng heard before, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow had the ability to save its master thrice. Each rescue would result in blinding one of its eyes.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the scene, Elvinia immediately understood what just happened. She died and used up one of the chances of salvation from the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Now blinded on one eye, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow circled the air once before rushing down towards Elvinia and returning to the inner world that carried it.</p>

  <p>After Zheng restored the sclerites in his body, he walked over towards Flamine who looked at him with a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>Hancock's tolerance to poison was far beyond anyone's imagination, but he instantly died after being stabbed by Zheng's 'tail'. Just what kind of horrifying poison did Zheng carry?</p>

  <p>Flamine was about to ask when another violent fluctuation came from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>It was so loud, deafening even, and for a brief second, they thought the world had been shattered.</p>

  <p>Auden's body came tumbling down from the sky and smashed onto the Oneness Mountain like a broken sandbag.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The impact caused the entire Oneness Mountain to shake violently.</p>

  <p>A crack appeared in the peak, running across the entire length of the mountain!</p>

  <p>The east side of the Oneness Mountain was relatively flat and faced the Dragon City, while the west side, wherein the Phoenix Palace was located, was a bit more concave.</p>

  <p>It was on the steep area of the west side that the crack appeared.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Auden who fell, a few more people also began to smash down onto the mountain face.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm was no doubt furious with how violent and heavy his attacks were.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>People like Auden who were stronger than the average warriors could still survive the impact, though with serious injuries.</p>

  <p>The weaker ones were not so lucky. Before they even reached the mountain, their bodies had already turned into a disgusting mass of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>As bodies continued to rain down from the sky, the crack in the middle of the mountain continued to expand, furthering the chances of the entire Oneness Mountain being cut in half!</p>

  <p>"We'd better get out of here as soon as possible!" Flamine told them. Pearce and the others had taken the risk in order to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi, while the members of the Bearing race were blocked by the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>This was their only chance to escape along with Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't have the same thought process. As he looked at the mountain on the verge of collapse, he suddenly thought of Yudie and Margaret!</p>

  <p>It wasn't that big of a problem since everyone in the Flow Sword Sect could fly but it could not be denied that the Bloom Divine Province had become a dangerous place to be in. Zheng knew he would have to bring them with him if they left.</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned for Elvinia to leave with Eastern Emperor Taiyi while he went to the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, before he could say anything, Emperor Charm suddenly appeared and swooped down over them.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token Mahoney lent him proved extremely effective in contending against dozens of enemies, to his advantage!</p>

  <p>"Run!" Flamine screamed.</p>

  <p>With a wave of her hand, Zheng, Elvinia, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were enveloped by a piece of space.</p>

  <p>As a demon woman of the Divine Lair in the past, she was also quite proficient in space theurgy.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to move, Emperor Charm was already at their heels.</p>

  <p>He stretched out a finger and summoned a blue cube out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>This blue cube slammed down on Flamine, Zheng, Elvinia, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, trapping them within.</p>

  <p>There was no escape. The space around them was locked.</p>

  <p>Flamine's expression darkened. She tried to create another space channel but the blue cube was unyielding.</p>

  <p>There was no way they could get out of this one. The most proficient master when it came to space theurgy, aside from that Chaos Ancient God, was Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"Is it useless?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>His gaze hardened and he decided to throw a punch towards the cube.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Aside from a muffled sound, there was no sort of fluctuation in the entire space.</p>

  <p>With them locked up, Emperor Charm became even more unbridled and direct.</p>

  <p>He soared into the sky before diving back towards the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>As he descended, Emperor Charm's body dissolved into countless blue cubes that scattered all over the mountain. The strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Pearce, could only rely on their own physical bodies to collide with these cubes.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Numerous explosions erupted all over the mountain as Pearce and his companions collided against Emperor Charm's cubes.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Emperor Charm came out of the mountain and continued his assault, further widening the crack on the mountain face.</p>

  <p>"I can't break Emperor Charm's space imprisonment!" Flamine exclaimed in panic.</p>

  <p>She paced back and forth within the cube, her face marred with anxiety.</p>

  <p>Elvinia couldn't help but feel restless upon seeing her mother so disturbed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was lost in thought as he stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>A strategy was currently being formulated in his mind. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is on the Other Shore. If we control his physical body, then his strength could be used, right?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Both Houyi and the real Emperor Charm remained beside him and hadn't yet returned to the Civilization Artifact. There was no way they were going to miss what was happening outside.</p>

  <p>Houyi was the first one to speak. "You want our souls to possess his body?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm shook his head. "As a supreme master, Eastern Emperor Taiyi surely has a powerful secret weapon to protect him. It won't be easy for us to control him with the energy soul."</p>

  <p>Zheng considered their inputs for a moment. "What about letting the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi try?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In theory, the two Eastern Emperor Taiyis were the same person. This one in front of them was only a replica projected to this round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's and Houyi's eyes flashed upon hearing Zheng's suggestion.</p>

  <p>Nobody in history had ever done such a thing, so naturally they needed to try it for themselves.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, a third figure appeared above Zheng's head, none other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>Flamine's eyes widened upon the sight. This Eastern Emperor Taiyi felt so familiar yet also so strange to her.</p>

  <p>Elvinia had seen this person in the Creation Myth Temple but was still stunned for a brief moment. Her heart thumped upon the realization of what Zheng intended to do.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, do you mind letting us use Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body for the time being?" Zheng asked. Flamine gaped at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had no idea what the man intended to do.</p>

  <p>However, since they were already in such a tight situation, anything was worth trying.</p>
