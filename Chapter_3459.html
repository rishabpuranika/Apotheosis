  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God stomped right onto Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>It was such a big blow that Luo Zheng fell down from the sky like a shooting star.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>He came crashing to the ground, marking the earth with a crater of around ten thousand feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng is helpless too.'</p>

  <p>Mount took a look at Luo Zheng who was defeated on the ground. He had expected this to happen.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mount was shocked that Luo Zheng had returned after being exiled.</p>

  <p>However, the power that Luo Zheng had displayed proved to be insufficient to go against the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the statues that descended from the Green Jade chessboard were powerful, but they would just trouble Mount a bit and he could still deal with them, let alone the Evil God who was more powerful.</p>

  <p>Even most of the powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were no match for the Evil God now.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Yan couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>As she was about to take a step forward and help Luo Zheng, a hand stretched from behind her and dragged her away.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, it was Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>"You are no match for the Evil God," Ling Shuang said.</p>

  <p>Yan was displeased hearing this, "And you think you're a match?!"</p>

  <p>"Neither am I," Ling Shuang responded, "but I can kill him."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she released Yan and made her way towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone who heard their words was in shock. How could Ling Shuang claim to be able to kill the Evil God, when Luo Zheng couldn't?</p>

  <p>However, from the look on Ling Shuang's face, they could tell that she was pretty convinced with herself.</p>

  <p>"Boring fight."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Evil God stretched out his black hand, and the bloodline power of the White Myth race returned to his body. Just then, the whirlpool in his hand opened for the second time.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God mentioned that he had no interest in Luo Zheng, he wanted to know Luo Zheng's secrets. Lucky for him, as they came from the same origin, he could just absorb Luo Zheng easily.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God descended gracefully down to the crater, Ling Shuang flew over from afar, shouting, "Stay away from Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God heard it, but was not threatened one bit. The female talents were worthless in his eyes - they were too weak. With a flick of a finger, he could even kill them. The last thing he could do was be bothered by her.</p>

  <p>But just as he brushed off Ling Shuang, a trembling force developed in his chest.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Every time Ling Shuang took a step forward, the Evil God felt his heart beat ring in his ears. It got louder and louder the closer Ling Shuang came.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God activated the Inheritance of World, he wasn't in the form of a human body anymore. How could he have a heartbeat?</p>

  <p>Still, the heartbeat persisted and still rang in his ears. It was not just some illusion.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>"Leave Luo Zheng alone," Ling Shuang threatened. "Or you'll die."</p>

  <p>Aside from Ling Shuang and the Evil God, no one could hear the heartbeat at all.</p>

  <p>It was the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng was able to obtain two Hearts of Accomplice from the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>One of the hearts had been taken away by Qiu Yinhe after he had learned it, while the second one was with Ling Shuang. Luo Zheng had asked her to hand the other over to the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Little did Luo Zheng know that Ling Shuang had kept it to herself.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Ear Mice, Ling Shuang knew clearly the function of the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>If one was deemed to be her accomplice, they would die if she did.</p>

  <p>In the past, a Celestial Wolf member at the early stage of the Chaotic Source Realm had killed a powerful master, Lord Shaw with the help of the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>She knew it was more than enough to deal with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"What is this heartbeat?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God turned around and faced Ling Shuang who stood at the edge of the crater, finally acknowledging her presence.</p>

  <p>Both the weird heartbeat and her decisive tone implied that she was not joking.</p>

  <p>"You get scared too, don't you?" she asked, pleased to see him change his face. "If so, then leave. You can still live if you do. Otherwise, you'll die,"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang spoke, making the Evil God fall into a difficult decision.</p>

  <p>He knew, just from her voice, that she wasn't lying. But how could he, the Evil God, be frightened away by a woman from the Taiyi Heaven Palace?</p>

  <p>This irritated more than it angered him.</p>

  <p>The others, including Mount, who were watching from far away were stunned.</p>

  <p>What was going on?</p>

  <p>Was Ling Shuang actually going to get the Evil God to retreat?</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" Seeing everything unfold, Qiu Yinhe frowned. "Luo Zheng had obtained two Hearts of Accomplice from the Other Shore before. It seems that Ling Shuang has kept one rather than given it to the Origin Mountain."</p>

  <p>"There are two Hearts of Accomplice? She is insane!"</p>

  <p>Winchell gasped, stunned to hear what Ling Shuang had done. He then finally understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang did keep it, and she made sure to use it well.</p>

  <p>But as powerful as it was, she would end up having to sacrifice her own life! Yasmin would be angry! The last thing she'd want to see was Ling Shuang's death.</p>

  <p>But all they could do was watch Ling Shuang worriedly.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The heartbeat grew louder in Ling Shuang's and the Evil God's ears.</p>

  <p>"You have ten seconds to leave," Ling Shuang said, her face was stone cold. She had hesitated for a long time previously, but now she just began to countdown, "Ten!"</p>

  <p>"Nine!"</p>

  <p>"Eight!"</p>

  <p>"Seven!"</p>

  <p>As she counted, streaks of black light began to surround the Evil God, and his eyes began to twitch involuntarily.</p>

  <p>He was at a disadvantage - all because of a young woman who was weaker than him. He cursed angrily in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Four."</p>

  <p>"Three."</p>

  <p>"Two."</p>

  <p>As Ling Shuang counted, her voice roared louder and louder.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to scream the last digit, a voice suddenly echoed from the bottom of the crater. "Stop, Ling Shuang."</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang's eyes flashed. It was Luo Zheng. Seeing Luo Zheng crawl up from the bottom of the crater, she fell into ecstasy, her gloomy eyes flashing with excitement and pleasure. "Luo Zheng! Are you okay?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't give the Heart of Accomplice to the Origin Mountain, did you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, his face was serious and unmoving.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang lowered her sight looking down on the ground. "Yeah." She had lied to Luo Zheng about this, and she couldn't help but feel guilty for it.</p>

  <p>"This is not the Other Shore Token that you should bear," Luo Zheng scolded.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw the Heart of Accomplice and go back this instant!"</p>

  <p>"But you..." Ling Shuang spoke back very anxiously, refusing to give up on what she had just done.</p>

  <p>The Evil God only had a life. If he wanted to keep it, he would make sure to listen. She thought this was the best plan.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to sacrifice her to save everyone here?" the Evil God teased, not missing any opportunity to provoke Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and looked at him coldly. "It seems that the Heart of Accomplice frightens you, and though I would love to see you squirm, this isn't worth it." Luo Zheng stared right at him. "We don't need to sacrifice anyone to defeat you."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a bright ray of cyan light burst from the top of his head.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact appeared above Luo Zheng's head, spinning continuously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's voice spread out like wildfire. "You have the Inheritance of World, so do I!"</p>
