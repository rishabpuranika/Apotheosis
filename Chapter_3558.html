  <p>The monster that lay prostrate on the ground suddenly jumped up and stood upright. The hideous thing looked a bit like the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>Yet, its appearance was more ferocious and aggressive--especially its thick scorpion tail, which glowed with a dark green light. It looked like it was ready to kill anyone who approached it at any time.</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge saw the monster get up, she instinctively took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>The monster's figure looked a little blurry and it was hard to see it clearly, just like when Luo Zheng had entered the Other Shore with his physical body.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge knew that this creature was most likely Luo Zheng, but she was still a little afraid and remained vigilant. "Is my appearance too horrible?" Luo Zheng suddenly piped in.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge sighed in relief when she heard the familiar voice. "You should have spoken earlier. Why did you frighten me?" she complained.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time I have seen such an expression from you," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>A red flush crept up Feng Ge's cheeks in embarrassment. "It's also the first time I've seen you look like this!" she snorted.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, we are on the Other Shore. If we were in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, I'm afraid I would've really scared you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng retracted the protruding bones as he spoke. The bone pieces folded into his body, then the tail, the spikes on his back, and the wide arms all disappeared and he returned to normal. Afterwards, he went straight to the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's life energy had been cut off and his entire body was covered in green mud.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Are you okay?" Yan shouted from her position in the array that trapped her. The array beneath her feet separated her from the outside world.</p>

  <p>Thus, both she and Natalie were not affected by the destruction.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at his sister in response. The thunder wings on his back flashed and he swiftly flew towards the back of the stage ruler's corpse. Then, he held the entire array in his arms and moved it down.</p>

  <p>"Step back," he said.</p>

  <p>In turn, Yan and Natalie went back to the other side of the array. Luo Zheng raised his hand and gently chopped the array, which caused it to explode and then collapse.</p>

  <p>Next, he stepped forward and took his sister in his arms. "I'm sorry. I got you involved for no reason..." he apologized.</p>

  <p>His sister did not deserve to suffer from such a catastrophe. Indeed, it was unfortunate that she was kidnapped and trapped in the Dark Region when she did not offend anyone.</p>

  <p>Yan pursed her lips and consoled Luo Zheng softly, "It's not for no reason. Your enemy is also my enemy."</p>

  <p>Although the two siblings had chosen different super forces to join, they had the same stand in the end.</p>

  <p>The accident was completely because of the fact that the Other Shore was too complicated and they had gotten set up.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of this, I am the one who was involved for no reason. Luo Zheng, shouldn't you apologize to me?" Natalie, who was behind them, chided with a grin.</p>

  <p>Just before they were kidnapped, the Star Falcon race couldn't tell which one of them was Yan. Thus, they abducted both of them together. Truly, Natalie had been quite unlucky as well.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to speak, Feng Ge interjected and said, "You should feel lucky to be saved. You are dreaming to get an apology."</p>

  <p>Since Yan was Luo Zheng's sister, Feng Ge usually ignored whatever words or emotions she conveyed. As for Natalie, Feng Ge ruthlessly dissed her.</p>

  <p>Then again, Natalie was also known for her arrogance in Li Shan mountain. Her face froze when she heard Feng Ge's words.</p>

  <p>"Why are you talking like that?" she hissed. "So what?" Feng Ge shot back.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!" Luo Zheng quickly interrupted them and frowned.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Feng Ge wasn't angry and she did not argue with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Instead, she retreated to the side with a smile, which made Natalie extremely mad.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was about to console Natalie, his eyes suddenly lit up. He looked over and saw that a circle of light floated above the stage ruler's corpse.</p>

  <p>The circle of light revolved around the air once, then it floated straight towards him. "What is that?" Natalie asked.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the circle of light came and enveloped Luo Zheng at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Once the circle of light had fully covered him, he disappeared in front of Feng Ge and the others like magic. The three women were left standing there in a daze, and did not know what just happened.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng did not expect such a thing to happen, either. The circle of light swooped down on him too fast and he didn't have the time to dodge. While he was in the light, he only felt the sky and earth spin continuously around him. When he opened his eyes again, everything he saw was filled with light, as if he had fallen into a world full of blazing brightness. There was nothing but a vast expanse of white in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?</p>

  <p>Feng Ge?</p>

  <p>Yan?" he called out, but there was no response.</p>

  <p>It looked like that the circle of light had teleported him into another place.</p>

  <p>He squatted down and touched the ground for a while, and he felt a cold and smooth floor.</p>

  <p>"This is not an illusion, but a real world..."</p>

  <p>When he came to this conclusion, he began to walk forward as his footsteps echoed loudly in the empty space.</p>

  <p>After he had wandered aimlessly for a distance in the snow-white world, he felt that his eyes had adapted to the environment. Eventually, he was slowly able to distinguish some white outlines.</p>

  <p>The white pillars in the distance gradually revealed themselves. There seemed to be something among the pillars, but it was still very difficult for him to see what it was. Even if he was very close to these pillars, he still couldn't see anything but white.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527, Master Green Jade, what's this place?" At that moment, he could only turn to the two of them for help.</p>

  <p>"I don't know." No. 9527's voice came through.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had used the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God just now, No. 9527 felt extremely alarmed. As for the snow-white world, No. 9527 had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Green Jade Spirit first observed the surroundings for a while after Luo Zheng had summoned him, then asked, "Did you kill a purified being?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," confirmed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I see.</p>

  <p>This is the Land of Inheritance, the Land of Inheritance of the purified beings," the Green Jade Spirit said. "The Land of Inheritance?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Well, after a purified being dies, their killer will replace them and become the new stage ruler, which I'm certain of--but the Land of Inheritance is just what we, the Green Jade Civilization call it. I haven't been to this place before. As for how to inherit the title of stage ruler and what this white world is really called, I have no idea." the Green Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>"The new stage ruler?" asked Luo Zheng. Needless to say, he was shocked. "If I become a stage ruler, will I be bound to Stage Fourteen?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the stage rulers on the Other Shore were limited to the stages they had dominated.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous stage rulers, Feng Ge was the only exception. She had only encountered problems when she crossed the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>The situation in the Lust World, however, was probably different from that in the Desire World. There was a reason Luo Zheng was worried.</p>

  <p>"It might be possible. At least, I've never seen a stage ruler like Feng Ge, who could leave the stage she dominated," the Green Jade Spirit answered honestly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Luo Zheng immediately became wary.</p>

  <p>Becoming a purified being would enable him to travel freely in the Dark Region, but the price would be to stay on Stage Fourteen forever. For him, the loss simply wasn't worth the gain.</p>
