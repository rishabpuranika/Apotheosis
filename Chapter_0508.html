<br/><br/>

  

  <p>For Luo Zheng, at his current level, the Spiritual Thorn could play two roles in his battles.</p>

  <p>The first role was to attack his opponents stealthily. The soul thorn had surprisingly good effects on the cultivators who were weak in their souls, or those who lacked strong protection and soul-defense. As Zheng's soul thorn attacked the cultivators, merely an instantaneous loss of consciousness could mean failure, or even worse— death in battle.</p>

  <p>The second function was to punish people. The feeling of penetration into one's soul was excruciating, the agony indescribable. To give a perceptible measurement, the pain it imposed on one's soul was at least ten times greater than that caused by penetration into one's physical body. The human body's capacity to bear pain was restricted. So, when people felt a lot of physical pain, their minds stopped controlling their bodies. Without commands from the nervous system, they simply fell into a state of shock. A person did not experience pain when he or she passed out. Coma was the best elixir one could hope for when one was in that kind of physical pain. However, one's soul could never lose consciousness, no matter how much pain it endured. The soul thoroughly tasted every single splinter of that pain.</p>

  <p>Whew! Luo Zheng released his soul thorn without hesitation.</p>

  <p>As the soul thorn hissed and made its way to stab into Bryson's head imperceptibly, a low groan escaped Bryson's lips at the pain he felt. His distorted facial expression told the others of the suffering he was enduring. Bryson's affliction also warned the others how terribly sorry they would be if they dared disobey his orders and betray the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Yet, Bryson still kept his mouth shut, not giving out the information that Luo Zheng needed. He knew that he would die immediately after he told Luo Zheng the secret, which was worse than being kept alive in such a painful state— even if he didn't believe his soul could take the agony anymore. The discord with Luo Zheng was not a small one. It was related to the murder of Zheng's father. Luo Zheng would certainly avenge his father's death by killing Bryson, the murderer. In Zheng's mind, that was the only end to the hostility he felt.</p>

  <p>The only thing Bryson could do was to tolerate the pain that Luo Zheng imposed on him. He bit his lip hard to stop himself from moaning, but sweat trickled down his face all too quickly as the ache became too much to ignore.</p>

  <p>"Is that enough pain for you?" Luo Zheng asked him coldly.</p>

  <p>Still, no words slipped out of Bryson's mouth.</p>

  <p>"It's fine if you don't want to talk," Luo Zheng said as his gaze fell on Ken.</p>

  <p>Ken was visibly shaking as he watched Bryson. He knew he himself was capable of enduring far less pain than what his brother could. Before Luo Zheng could say another word, Ken answered him quickly. "I'll talk! I can tell you everything you want to know. It was the Qi Clan! Ford Qi, the head of the Qi Clan. It was he who killed Mike. He killed your father with his own two hands! Please, Luo Zheng, please don't kill me. I was just a…"</p>

  <p>Bryson sighed silently as he heard Ken's words. 'My idiot brother is entirely unreliable!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, replying, "Very good!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng waved his arm, the sword in his hand flexed, reflecting a cold, sharp beam of light. It ran straight at Ken. Ken's face paled, his entire body shaking more than ever. As the sword almost reached Ken's forehead, it was redirected. If it had pushed just a few inches farther, Ken's body would have been lying lifelessly on the ground. However, the sword changed direction and pushed into Bryson instead, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Poof! The sword cut off Bryson's neck, and his head fell onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once said that he wouldn't kill anyone from the Luo Clan since they were family. He shared their blood, which was why back on Hell Mountain, Luo Zheng had only disabled Perrin but hadn't taken Perrin's life.</p>

  <p>However, today was different. Luo Zheng had to sentence Bryson to death. Luo Zheng needed to kill him on his own. Bryson was one of his father's killers. He had been the primary conspirator in the murder. Luo Zheng had to avenge Mike's death and the first step in doing that was taking Bryson's life.</p>

  <p>Being an accomplice in Mike's murder aside, Bryson was also always regarded with general disgust. Everyone in the Luo Clan hated his guts.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't killed Bryson today, he wouldn't have been able to earn the trust of the youngsters in the clan. Deep down, these people had been fearful of Bryson ever since Mike's death. It wasn't hard to gather that little fact even if they didn't convey it to Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng would have to leave the Luo Clan one day, and after Luo Zheng left the clan, they would be afraid that Bryson would rise to power again. He would have come back in the future if Luo Zheng hadn't killed him today. Each one of the members would have a price to pay by then. So they wanted Bryson dead— it was the only way they would feel safe in the Luo Clan. For the youngsters, as well as for the good of the clan, Luo Zheng had been committed to wiping out this concern of theirs.</p>

  <p>Bryson Luo had to die.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was all too aware of how everyone released their harsh breaths as they witnessed Bryson's death.</p>

  <p>Several wisps of malicious Mu Ning escaped Bryson's corpse. Luo Zheng knew Bryson had been the disciple of the Blood Prisoner. He had learned the Blood Evil Force from his master. Still, Luo Zheng did not expect Bryson had that much amount of malice Mu Ning amassed in his body. It seemed that in order to improve his strength and levels, Bryson had killed a lot of people, much more than Luo Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the malicious Mu Ning that broke loose from Bryson's body gathered and condensed into a blood-colored crystal.</p>

  <p>Adding up the blood-colored crystals Luo Zheng had collected before, he had four of these crystals in total now.</p>
