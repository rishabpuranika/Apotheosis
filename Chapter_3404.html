<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3404 Unexpected Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Acting on instinct, six women of the Snake Goddess race stationed themselves before Yan. They had their eyes fixated on the people of the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>The scales on the bodies of these women flickered with a pinch of dark gold light. Their radiant faces reflected hints of vigilance as if they were on guard against them.</p>

  <p>Their formation was not just a coincidence, but was intentional. Their positions formed the Six Snake Shadows Array of the Li Shan mountain. They were exactly the Six Snake Shadows.</p>

  <p>The Six Snake Shadows had made a name for themselves in the Source World. The Li Shan mountain would handpick only the most exceptional talents from each generation of the Snake Goddess race and recruit them. They would then offer them rigorous training to become a part of the Six Snake Shadows.</p>

  <p>Accompanying Yan, the Six Snake Shadows were given two missions to carry out in the Chaotic Source World: they were to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, and they had to protect Yan at all costs. Even though Yan's strength was on par with the geniuses from other super forces, they still didn't want to take any chances. For Li Shan mountain, Yan was an invaluable treasure.</p>

  <p>Yan turned back. Her face was robbed of all emotions, as she glared at those of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race with piercing eyes.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" She asked Khalid.</p>

  <p>"Who are you to stop us? If it bothers you so much, why don't you join him too?" Khalid retorted while furrowing his brows.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of the warriors from Li Shan mountain forced the people of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race to stay on guard. Even with their empowering presence, it wasn't enough to make them retreat.</p>

  <p>However, the situation would now become extremely troublesome.</p>

  <p>Mount watched all this unravel from a distance and frowned.</p>

  <p>Normally he would not back away from a fight against the people from Li Shan mountain or the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but the situation demanded otherwise.</p>

  <p>Mount didn't agree with the timing and place of this issue. Moreover, he had a hunch that something was wrong with this place.</p>

  <p>The sculptures inside the cave gave off an eerie vibe. Furthermore, the location of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still unknown. Even if they somehow defeated the enemy in time, there would always be a chance of someone taking advantage of their preoccupation and stealing the Chaotic Source Spirits for themselves.</p>

  <p>Yan kept her unfaltering gaze at Khalid. Her lusciously long black hair fluttered in the air as a trace of red light enveloped her, responding to her rage. "This place isn't ideal for a fight. But, if you're asking for it, we won't hold back."</p>

  <p>As if to solidify her statement, the bodies of the Six Snake Shadows began to glow with cyan color. The Other Shore Power inside other people from the Snake Goddess race began to surge as they activated it.</p>

  <p>Khalid never expected such a little girl to hold that much authority over the others. Of course, he didn't want to act on impulse and run into a battle blindly without considering the aftereffects.</p>

  <p>During the intense exchange of provoking statements, Mount walked over to Khalid and placed his hands on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Our primary goal right now is to find those Chaotic Source Spirits. This isn't the time to wage unnecessary battles."</p>

  <p>Khalid was a powerful warrior thus pride came as second nature to him. He wouldn't just sit around and gulp down the bitter juice of defeat, especially not at the hands of these women of Li Shan mountain. If Yan continued with her threats, he would probably be provoked into fighting them head-on.</p>

  <p>Mount was familiar with Khalid's temperament. Fearing Khalid would act impulsively, he walked over to him to calm his nerves down.</p>

  <p>Khalid clenched his fists as he glared at Luo Zheng and Yan before he turned to leave.</p>

  <p>But, just as he turned back, his long spear suddenly moved. At the same time, a skull emerged out of nowhere in his hand. He clasped the white spear in his hand and charged in Luo Zheng and Yan's direction with determined eyes.</p>

  <p>"Devil Soul-sucking Spear!"</p>

  <p>As he chanted the words, a light with a mixture of black and gray shot out from the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>Khalid's surprise attack shocked both the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain. The energy surging from his move was unbelievably strong.</p>

  <p>The light seemed to hold a mysterious kind of power. Even the people of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race were taken aback by it. Mount had mixed expressions on his face. He was annoyed that Khalid had shunned his advice, but he was also surprised at how fast he moved.</p>

  <p>Khalid's attack seemed simple, but he had been planning for this moment for a long time.</p>

  <p>Yan and Luo Zheng were the two most important figures of the Li Shan mountain and the Taiyi Heaven Palace, respectively. If they were killed, the others wouldn't pose as much of a challenge.</p>

  <p>His Devil Soul-sucking Spear was formidable. It could one-shot any opponent.</p>

  <p>The light passed by like a flash. It bypassed many people, including the Six Snake Shadows and went towards its two targets, Yan and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before the Six Snake Shadows even had the time to react, it had already reached Yan.</p>

  <p>Yan was strong, but she didn't expect this to happen at all. She had pinned Khalid to be a coward who could only throw empty threats and do nothing more.</p>

  <p>Just as he sensed the unique energy emanating from the light, Luo Zheng became serious.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his Civilization Artifact was activated. As soon as he focused hard, an emerald-like feather emerged and floated in the space above him.</p>

  <p>Remaining quick on his feet, he grabbed Yan, turned around and ran with her to avoid the light.</p>

  <p>With a whoosh, the light brushed past Luo Zheng, making slight contact with his clothes.</p>

  <p>As a result, the fiber of the clothes on his back began to rot. The skin directly beneath the fabric turned a charred-black color.</p>

  <p>Even though the light shot from the spear was free of poison, the spear itself was a manifestation of pure evil. The light contained a strong power capable of corrosion.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Luo Zheng's body was resilient against such energy. If he were an ordinary human being, he would not have survived!</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! I'll make you regret this when I'm through with you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was fuming with rage. They had stepped over his last nerve that kept him sane.</p>

  <p>He had been wanting to teach the people from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Jin Wu a lesson.</p>

  <p>But he shared the same thoughts as Mount. This was not the right place for a fight. However, he had planned to pay them back for the past with interest once they were outside.</p>

  <p>But now, the circumstances had changed. Khalid had declared war when he first aimed at Yan. Yan's safety was Luo Zheng's biggest concern. If anyone threatened it, Luo Zheng would make sure they didn't live to make the same mistake twice.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Luo Zheng dashed towards Khalid with agility. It was hard to keep track of his movements. It was as if he was a ghost.</p>

  <p>Seeing his assault had failed, Khalid realized he misjudged the limits of Luo Zheng's capabilities.</p>

  <p>The skill Luo Zheng had used to dodge his strike was beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>From his perspective, there was no one in the same level of the Other Shore Realm in the Source World who could have survived that attack.</p>

  <p>He had been so sure that he wouldn't miss his target.</p>

  <p>However, with a single twist of his body, Luo Zheng had made a mockery out of it.</p>

  <p>Before he could retrieve his spear to defend himself, Luo Zheng had already approached him.</p>

  <p>Judging by the situation Khalid was in, it wouldn't be wise to retreat. He decided to take the risk and remain where he stood. The skull in his right hand began to rattle in response to his ordeal. At the same time, a solid beam of brown light swirled around the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>He was planning to retaliate with a more powerful strike than before!</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng close the distance between himself and them, Mount and Mya took caution to the situation and became serious.</p>

  <p>They blamed Khalid in their hearts for provoking an avoidable scenario because of his impulse. Even so, they had to do something to stop Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Khalid were to die, the Bearing race would suffer an incalculable loss.</p>

  <p>They couldn't just stand by and let this happen.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Mount's body underwent violent tremors, and then a layer of gold light surged out of his tanned skin. The outburst of energy from his body resembled that of a sturdy mountain.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mya ascended to the sky and stationed herself behind Mount. A loud cracking sound of bones resounded in the air around her as her right hand broke itself.</p>

  <p>From the joint of her elbow, a small puppet emerged as it floated above it. It was her Other Shore Token. The puppet appeared to have been connected to her body with her forearm. Its appearance was nothing short of creepy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng showed no signs of hesitation even though he knew he would have to take on all three of them at once. He was determined to tear Khalid into pieces no matter the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Before the both sides could confront each other, the eyes of the sculptures in the cave suddenly opened.</p>
