  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since this group of people was sailing downwind, their speed was naturally incomparably fast. It was impossible for Luo Zheng and the woman to avoid them.</p>

  <p>"We might be in trouble," the woman who was sailing behind Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed at the Truth Boats and counted fifteen of them heading toward him.</p>

  <p>Boats condensed by different Truths of Divine Dao emitted different auras.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng's boat, which he had condensed with the Truth of Cultivation Nature, gave people a sense of peace and nature. The woman behind him, on the other hand, had used the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent to condense her boat. As her boat drifted on the sea, it gave off a sharp aura.</p>

  <p>The auras of these fifteen boats were exactly the same, and there were some faint space fluctuations. Luo Zheng assumed that these people must be cultivating the Truth of Void Destruction.</p>

  <p>And they all probably belonged to the same great force.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng came to this conclusion, the fifteen boats spread out in the formation of a fan and blocked his way.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" said a robust figure standing on the Truth Boat right at the front.</p>

  <p>People wouldn't be able to see each other clearly in the Sea of Truth, but just from the vague figure of this person, Luo Zheng could tell that the person was very strong.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Truth Boat slowly came to a stop. "What's up?" he asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Just as the figure was about to answer, the woman behind Luo Zheng said, "No need to ask. They probably want to extort a few soul pills from us!"</p>

  <p>"Soul pills?" Luo Zheng echoed curiously.</p>

  <p>It sounded like something that could strengthen the soul. However, there was a big difference between the names of pills in the Source World and the divine land, so Luo Zheng was unable to tell the effect of these pills just by their name.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you ever heard of soul pills? How did you even step into the Sea of Truth?" the woman asked, surprised by the confusion in Luo Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>"Stop playing dumb! If you want to pass, each of you has to hand over three soul pills. Otherwise, you will die in the Sea of Truth today," the head of the group said coldly in an unquestionable tone.</p>

  <p>The woman behind Luo Zheng also assumed that he was playing dumb.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, there were some pills that were specially used for souls, and the soul pill was one of them.</p>

  <p>If one's soul was not strong enough while they were crossing the Sea of Truth, they would need to rely on soul pills at critical moments.</p>

  <p>This was especially true when they broke through the nine lines in the Sea of Truth. Every line was an obstacle. A few soul pills could prove to be the trump card that one needed to break through these obstacles.</p>

  <p>Such pills were common in the Source World, but the materials used for refining the soul pills were very precious. Moreover, there was a grand demand for soul pills as every disciple would be given a few by their respective clan when they went to cross the Sea of Truth. Therefore, soul pills were hard to obtain.</p>

  <p>Bigger clans had abundant soul pills while smaller ones were usually short of them.</p>

  <p>Thus, the disciples of these weaker clans had come up with ways to get their hands on soul pills. For example, they often united in groups in the Sea of Truth and relied on the advantage of number to plunder soul pills from others sailing on the sea.</p>

  <p>If they came across disciples of the bigger clans, especially those who were sailing in big groups, they would naturally not make trouble for them.</p>

  <p>Truth Boats which were sailing alone or in a small group of two or three, like Luo Zheng and the woman, were their targets.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Don't get in a fight with these people. They are a team. Give them a few soul pills, and we will be safe!" the woman behind Luo Zheng urged him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was both angry and amused at her words. "First, I don't know what soul pills are and I really don't have them. Second, even if I had them, I wouldn't pay your share too."</p>

  <p>The woman curled her lips in displeasure. "How could you be so heartless?"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. You two should take out the soul pills as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Then, I will let you go. Otherwise, you will die in the Sea of Truth. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>As the leader of the group spoke, he released his aura. It was obvious that he was preparing a soul attack.</p>

  <p>The other fourteen people with him also began preparing for a soul attack.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the warriors who were in the first section of the Sea of Truth had just stepped into the sea not long ago. In terms of soul power, they were all at about the same level. Luo Zheng's Soul of Light far exceeded that of consummate True Gods in the divine land. Even so, it would be difficult for him to deal with fifteen Souls of Light banded together.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng faced the leader of the group, his expression slightly darkened. "Die in the Sea of Truth? What can you do to me if I just leave?"</p>

  <p>Back in the Abyss Demon Region, Luo Zheng had stepped into the Sea of Truth with his physical body and smashed the boat of a warrior. Those warriors could temporarily leave the Sea of Truth and avoid falling into the sea.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, we have plenty of time. If you think you won't come back to the Sea of Truth, go ahead. But you'll definitely come back...and when you do, we'll be waiting right here!" another warrior in the group sneered.</p>

  <p>Of course, they weren't really going to stay here for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>However, most warriors in this situation would rather sacrifice some soul pills to buy peace, so they were confident that Luo Zheng would do the same.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Luo Zheng really didn't have any soul pills with him.</p>

  <p>"I really don't have any soul pills," Luo Zheng insisted honestly.</p>

  <p>"You brat! You want to do this the hard way? Don't say I didn't warn you...</p>

  <p>We just wanted to accumulate enough soul pills to make it through the first line. If you're not willing to hand them over, I'm afraid you have to pay with your life!"</p>

  <p>The auras of the people blocking them soared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and a ray of golden light flashed in them. Although he was under the pressure of facing fifteen Souls of Light at the same time, he didn't want to back out.</p>

  <p>After all, he knew that if he really was defeated, he could still leave the Sea of Truth immediately. He did not believe that these people would really stay here for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>As the woman behind Luo Zheng watched the argument escalate, she became more and more anxious.</p>

  <p>Until now, she had thought that Luo Zheng was only bargaining with these people; it had never occurred to her that he would really refuse to hand over what they were asking for.</p>

  <p>'This is not worth getting into a fight for, ' the woman thought, sighing in her heart.</p>

  <p>With her abilities, she could tear these people into pieces using her soul weapon.</p>

  <p>But in her eyes, they were nothing but scum. It would be a total waste to use her soul weapon to deal with them. Finally, she sighed and said, "All right, everyone. Don't make a move. I'll give you the soul pills!"</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she waved her hand, and six rays of brown light shot forward and landed on the boat of the head of the group.</p>

  <p>When the brown light swept past Luo Zheng, he felt a strong soul force graze him.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the soul pill was indeed a precious pill that could nourish souls.</p>

  <p>"You should have taken them out earlier. Well, at least one of you is sensible!"</p>

  <p>The head of the group picked up the soul pills, sneered, and then turned around and rushed away. The others also followed him with a roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>Once they were out of sight, the woman said, "You owe me three soul pills!"</p>

  <p>"Are they really that useful in the Sea of Truth?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course they are. They are still of much use even after one reaches the Other Shore. Isn't there a saying? Soul pills are the currency of the Other Shore!" Then, the woman hesitated and continued, "You seem to... You really don't know anything about soul pills?"</p>

  <p>It was impossible for cultivators in the Source World to not know what soul pills were, so she couldn't help but feel suspicious about Luo Zheng.</p>
