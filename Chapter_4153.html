  <p>
</p>

  <p>Trampled under Duran's feet, Balfour remained fearless. Instead, he smiled sinisterly and said, "I'm indeed no match for you, but since you showed up, this probably means that the Bird Spirit Sect cannot deal with our continuous attacks, right?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect launched eleven attacks before, but Duran did not participate in any.</p>

  <p>Duran's presence only meant that the Bird Spirit Sect was worn out. They had no choice but to send their stronger Bird Masters to counter the attacks of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Vengeance appeared in his eyes. Balfour's words struck the wrong cord.</p>

  <p>The battle between the Bird Spirit and Snake Spirit Sects in the Jade Pure Realm had been fierce. However, the two forces were not evenly-matched and the Bird Spirit Sect was always left at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>However, it proved impossible for the Snake Spirit Sect to take down the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Though the Bird Spirit King Sheehan hadn't awakened, he still had extraordinary strength. It was difficult for the Snake Spirit King to send the Bird Spirit Sect on their knees.</p>

  <p>Thus, this seemingly endless war continued for countless years. It never ceased.</p>

  <p>According to the will of Sheehan, the Bird Masters supported the Nihility race in a plot to destroy this chaos.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Bird Masters, the Nihility race grew in strength and number. The Bird Masters were notably impressed with the performance of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and they were pleased to see that in this round of chaos, the Evil God that joined the Nihility race had controlled the Source World for their advantage.</p>

  <p>Nothing like this had ever happened in the past.</p>

  <p>This was the Bird Masters' opportunity.</p>

  <p>If they used the Source World to destroy the chaos, everything would easily return to zero.</p>

  <p>However, not long after the Evil God took control of the Source World, the Snake Spirit Sect launched another attack.</p>

  <p>They had even moved the coordinates to the Mist City - they were determined to win the battle.</p>

  <p>This Bird Spirit Sect had no choice but to resist and counterattack.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings from the Snake Spirit Sect launched eleven attacks. The Bird Masters and spirits eventually grew exhausted. A few of the bird spirits were still being revived, which would take much time.</p>

  <p>Because some bird spirits hadn't been revived, Duran had to fill the vacancy.</p>

  <p>However, the attacks of the Snake Spirit Sect never ceased. They assumed that the Snake Spirit Sect would launch countless more attacks until the Bird Spirit Sect's Treacherous Beings had no more back-up.</p>

  <p>Their tactic of repeated attacks to weaken their army aggravated Duran.</p>

  <p>He was furious.</p>

  <p>"Since you are so angry, why don't you just kill me?" Balfour said, emotionless.</p>

  <p>He didn't care at this point. He just wanted it to be over. After all, he could be revived even if he died.</p>

  <p>Duran looked at the Snake Master with a sudden kindness, "I won't kill you. I will merely imprison you!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke his last word, he grabbed Balfour with his claws and flew away.</p>

  <p>If Balfour was imprisoned, he could not revive himself. This meant a great deal for them, because Balfour would not be able to participate in the next round of battle.</p>

  <p>"Duran, you don't think we've thought this though?" Balfour said with a smug grin.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Light of Annihilation exploded from Balfour's body.</p>

  <p>His Treacherous Being form collapsed and disappeared from the grasp of Duran's claws, leaving only a few Holy Stones that fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Just like that, the twelfth attack of the Snake Spirit Sect ended after a full day.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect failed while the Treacherous Beings that participated in the charge were completely annihilated.</p>

  <p>However, the Bird Masters felt exasperated. Meanwhile, the group gathered together to discuss countermeasures.</p>

  <p>Behind the Wine Basin, golden coordinates floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Most of the surfaces on the coordinates were dim, which only meant that they lacked energy and needed time to recover.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit Sect would not give them enough time to do so. No doubt the thirteenth round of attack was already underway.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the Snake Spirit Sect in the Mist City seemed more relaxed after what had happened.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Snake Masters, it was only a matter of time until they defeated the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>In the northwest of the Mist City, golden coordinates glowed brightly and the human spirits of the three houses returned to life.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Alphonse exited his coordinates in his human form. He appeared fatigued.</p>

  <p>He went all out in this battle to impress the Snake Masters just so they would make things easier for the three houses.</p>

  <p>But when he saw Gianni with his arms crossed across his chest, his expression darkened.</p>

  <p>As the human spirits resurrected, Balfour stealthily slithered over.</p>

  <p>He scanned through the human spirits present, and then his gaze landed on Gianni. "You did a good job in this round of attack," he praised. "The revival of the human spirits is fast. The three houses of the human spirits are an indispensable force for our Cyan Snake Department!"</p>

  <p>When the human spirits heard Balfour's words, their jaws dropped and their hearts skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>If Balfour actually valued the three houses, there was no way he would erase their coordinates.</p>

  <p>Gianni responded modestly, "This is all thanks to your clever plan." He bowed and continued, "The human spirits feared that their coordinates would be erased, so they fought long and hard. If their lives are not threatened, they would still hold back in the fight."</p>

  <p>"So you mean..." Balfour blinked repeatedly as he analyzed what he'd said.</p>

  <p>"I had intended to erase ten people's coordinates. Since the three houses performed well, I suggest we still stick to the original plan of only erasing five people's coordinates!" Gianni concluded.</p>

  <p>"Do as you say," Balfour replied.</p>

  <p>Both Alphonse and Hamilton were furious.</p>

  <p>The surrounding human spirits glared at Gianni in anger.</p>

  <p>However, Gianni acted as if he didn't care. "In the twelfth round of attack, the first five people who died were Yurem, Ezekiel, Rishi, Shaun and Jaidyn!"</p>

  <p>Every time someone's name was called, that person turned pale and trembled with fright.</p>

  <p>"General Gianni! Give me one more chance!" Yurem fell down to his knees and begged.</p>

  <p>"Master Balfour, I died only because I was careless this time. I did fight with all my strength..." Ezekiel attempted to persuade.</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>As Gianni faced these people's excuses and begging, his cold expression never changed. "Rules are rules. If these rules could be so easily changed, then no one would be working hard."</p>

  <p>He walked to the coordinates of the five with a golden hammer condensed in his hand. This weapon was given to him by Balfour, and was used to dispose of coordinates.</p>

  <p>With one swing, he lightly hit on one of the coordinates and it shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>The human spirit named Yurem shrieked in agony. Then, his body lightened and lightened as it slowly turned into a transparent shadow that eventually disappeared.</p>

  <p>"How... How dare you really do this to us! I will fight you to death!"</p>

  <p>"Let's fight together!"</p>

  <p>Ezekiel and Rishi nodded at each other and rushed towards Gianni, while the other human spirits didn't react.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Alphonse and Hamilton, was extremely angry, but none of them wanted to walk to their deaths.</p>

  <p>Before Ezekiel and Rishi could even get close to Gianni, Balfour curled his tail and swung it. Just like that, these Treacherous Beings dispersed.</p>

  <p>Gianni looked at them and scoffed, then continued to break the remaining coordinates one by one.</p>

  <p>Within a minute, the four human spirits lost the chance to revive forever and died in the secondary world.</p>
