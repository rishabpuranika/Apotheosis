  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper was startled by the sudden falling starlight.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that the fellow in front of him would be able to activate the token at this time.</p>

  <p>Without time to think about anything, he abruptly gritted his teeth and rolled away.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The starlight almost grazed his scalp as it fell and left a big crater in the ground.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper looked up at Luo Zheng with a strange expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"The truth token? Where did you cultivate it?"</p>

  <p>As one of the most powerful masters in the Source World, he knew that the truth token was very rare.</p>

  <p>A cultivator could use the Grand World Cultivation Method to comprehend the Divine Dao. When they reached the top level of the Divine Dao, they could master the Truth of Divine Dao, and then get to the Other Shore...</p>

  <p>Only those with great talent and perseverance would finally be able to succeed.</p>

  <p>As for how long they could move forward after arriving at the Other Shore, that would depend on their own abilities.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for anyone to comprehend the truth on their own; this was a widely-accepted fact in the Source World.</p>

  <p>So now, seeing Luo Zheng use the truth token was a great surprise to the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng just ignored him.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to know that the tomb keeper was able to see through his bloodline token, but he didn't want to waste his time on such trifles.</p>

  <p>He knew that the best course of action would be to finish the battle as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>As the Truth Crystal rotated, another green star fell down.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Luo Zheng turned around and picked up his long sword from the ground. A beam of green light enveloped the sword as he rushed toward the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Emily was kneeling on the ground and breathing deeply with her hand pressed to her chest.</p>

  <p>As blood flowed along the edge of the blade, she felt her consciousness blurring away.</p>

  <p>A sense of crisis flooded her. Was she going to die here today?</p>

  <p>In the current state that she was in, she would not be able to hold on for a long time.</p>

  <p>'That guy is so determined...' She stared blankly at Luo Zheng in the distance, feeling a little touched in her heart.</p>

  <p>No one had moved her this much in a long time.</p>

  <p>As the fierce battle raged on, more and more warriors fell to the ground, never to get back up again.</p>

  <p>The sound of their miserable cries and the smell of blood filled the air.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, wars among warriors who had mortal bodies were more cruel and bloody than those among the mighty masters.</p>

  <p>On the other side, the purple-haired man from the Warden race leaped off the roof in pursuit of an exile.</p>

  <p>The exile was seriously injured and spilling a trail of blood behind him as he ran.</p>

  <p>After a moment, he stumbled and let out a heavy gasp, almost unable to catch his breath.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The purple-haired man stopped and, with the blue saber in his hand, slashed at the exile.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>He hated these invaders with a passion.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for them, he would have likely become the new leader of the Warden race after the current one died.</p>

  <p>The exile had exhausted his strength, so he could only roll on the ground to avoid the attack. However, it was too late for him to get up.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The purple-haired man raised the saber once more and swung down.</p>

  <p>This time, he hit his target; the exile's head flew off his body.</p>

  <p>Then, the man turned around to return to the battlefield.</p>

  <p>He had come a long way from the battlefield in order to hunt down this exile.</p>

  <p>But just as he jumped up and climbed onto the roof, a black rope suddenly appeared in front of his neck!</p>

  <p>Before he could react, the rope was pulled back at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>His instincts told him to cut off the rope with the saber in his hand.</p>

  <p>However, he had barely lifted his right arm when he felt it go cold. In a split-second, it was neatly cut off from below his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he spoke, he felt his left arm and his legs go cold as well.</p>

  <p>All his limbs had been cut off!</p>

  <p>The chill lasted for a few seconds before he felt an unbearable pain shoot through his body.</p>

  <p>The severe pain made his face turn completely scarlet, and the muscles on his face constantly twisted around.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a man walked out of the dark corner.</p>

  <p>When the purple-haired man turned to his direction, a look of surprise came over his face. "Spark!"</p>

  <p>The Warden race had planned to use Spark's power to fight against Emily, but the result had not been satisfying, so they had chosen to give up.</p>

  <p>However, the purple-haired man hadn't expected that Spark would escape the disaster and appear here at this time.</p>

  <p>With a sharp knife in his hand, Spark looked down at the man with purple hair and said with a sneer, "I'm the one who has always schemed against others. I didn't expect you to play a trick on me this time..."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. You are also prisoners in this world. How can our Warden race let you go?" the purple-haired man said snidely, bearing the sharp pain.</p>

  <p>"You are right. We've been in different positions from the beginning, so we should not cooperate." Spark nodded and pointed the knife in his hand at the purple-haired man. "Tell me how to remove the Strength Equalizing token."</p>

  <p>The purple-haired man sneered, "Do you think I'll tell you?"</p>

  <p>Spark shrugged. Without any hesitation, he stabbed the sharp knife into the belly of the purple-haired man. Then, he slowly slid the knife to the left, making a small cut. "If you can't help me remove the Strength Equalizing token in five minutes, you will bleed to death. Whether you die or stay alive is up to you."</p>

  <p>Then, Spark stepped back and leaned against the wall with an indifferent expression on his face.</p>

  <p>With all his limbs gone, the man with purple hair was unable to move or stop his bleeding. If he continued like this, he would definitely die.</p>

  <p>The only way to save himself was to terminate the Strength Equalizing token.</p>

  <p>But right now, the Warden race still had the strength to fight against the invaders. However, if he did as Spark said and stopped the Strength Equalizing token, Emily alone would be able to defeat their whole race!</p>

  <p>Drip, drip, drip...</p>

  <p>As the sound of blood dripping reached the man's ear, a hint of panic appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Sensing his anxiety, Spark smiled. "The only person who can save you is yourself."</p>

  <p>The man with purple hair had a fierce struggle in his heart. He was not afraid of death, but he was unwilling to die silently like this.</p>

  <p>After about thirty seconds, he said, "There are two solutions. The first one is to reset the Equality Altar to the original state, and the other is to destroy the Equality Altar."</p>

  <p>"Which way is faster?" Spark asked.</p>

  <p>"The first one! It's not that easy to destroy the Equality Altar. With your current ability, you wouldn't be able to destroy it even after several days and nights!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me the way to reset it then," Spark said calmly.</p>

  <p>Soon, Spark left the corner and wiped away the blood on his sharp knife.</p>

  <p>There was a fierce battle going on not far away. He sneered in that direction and then walked in another direction.</p>

  <p>Now that all of the warriors of the Warden race had been sent out to fight, there was no one guarding the Equality Altar.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to destroy the Equality Altar, and only a few members of the Warden race knew how to reset it, so it was meaningless to guard the Equality Altar now.</p>

  <p>At this time, Spark quietly appeared on the other side of the square and quickly strode to the Equality Altar.</p>
