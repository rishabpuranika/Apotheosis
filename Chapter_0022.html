  <p>
</p>

  <p>Add to that, the fact that there was still a considerable gap between how far along he'd progressed next to what Evil Lan and Bryson could do. His growth had been too slow.</p>

  <p>Fate could be a cruel mistress! It was only recently, Luo Luo Zheng had finally gotten the chance to hone his skills, practice and strengthen himself, and he was hopeful that he could go so much further, becoming more powerful. Now, he was at the mercy of Evil Lan, and his situation was desperate.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng bemoaned his predicament, Evil Lan was busy in the cave.</p>

  <p>Whatever he was preparing, it took a long time and was loud. First, Evil Lan was in the corner, hammering away, and then he disappeared into the weapon refining furnace carrying some object. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't see what he was doing in there. After a while, Evil Lan came out, sat in front of the stove in an odd pose and clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>As Evil Lan sat clapping, the dark weapon refining furnace was lit up.</p>

  <p>Complex yet elegant runes appeared one after another, as though blooming along the surface of the furnace wall, emitting a dazzling red glow, and lighting up the entire cave.</p>

  <p>Hanging, skewered by spears on the walls, living creatures contorted in pain. Their anguished screams filled the room as their blood flowed along the spikes, while it was all sucked into the weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>The blood flowed along the currents on the weapon refining furnace wall and filled the fragments, making the red light more vivid and fascinating.</p>

  <p>After he fired up the furnace, Evil Lan picked up a sword. The black and white sword in Evil Lan's hands must be the Hell Fire Sword which was a top grade of the mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Evil Lan held the Hell Fire Sword for a while, gazing with pride and tenderness like the cold metal object were a son. His eyes softened, and his stance relaxed as he stroked it as though he were touching a lover. Watching the scene unnoticed from the off to the side, Luo Luo Zheng observed Evil Lan's reaction. It startled Luo Luo Zheng to see such fondness on such an evil face. Luo Zheng's heart lurched, and he had an unshakable feeling that trouble lay ahead. Evil Lan was a madman.</p>

  <p>After taking his time polishing the mysterious weapon, Evil Lan turned his head toward Luo Luo Zheng. There was a peculiar smile on his face, and he gave Luo Luo Zheng an odd look. He walked over, and as he pulled Luo Luo Zheng out of the cage, he said,"</p>

  <p>You should feel honored to be integrated into my Hell Fire Sword."</p>

  <p>Realizing it was senseless to respond to this madman, Evil Lan, Luo Luo Zheng just shook his head slowly and followed his insane captor. Given how much more powerful Evil Lan was, Luo Luo Zheng thought of himself as unlucky. Seeing no way out, Luo Luo Zheng sighed thinking that soon he would be consumed by the fire until nothing but ashes remained. It was a pity that his hatred had not been reported, and he was not even capable of revenge. Luo Luo Zheng was helpless to anything and felt resentment at the injustice of God. Damn, his weak skills!</p>

  <p>At least he wouldn't make it easy for Evil Lan, who had to drag Luo Luo Zheng the entire way. They stopped in front of the weapon refining furnace, and Evil Lan repositioned himself before forcing Luo Luo Zheng into the furnace.</p>

  <p>Within the bowels of the refinery, the hearth was dark, all Luo Luo Zheng could see were remnants burning in the fire, and a table sitting in the center of the furnace.</p>

  <p>Coming in behind Luo Luo Zheng, Evil Lan placed his Hell Fire Sword on the table, turned, giving Luo Luo Zheng a ruthless smile before leaving.</p>

  <p>When Evil Lan reached the mouth of the furnace, he stopped suddenly as though he'd forgotten something. He turned back, and with a flick of his fingers, some yellow powder appeared and covered Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng breathed in, he inhaled a small amount of the fragrant yellow powder, and even though it was a tiny portion, it made Luo Luo Zheng feel weak all over. He recognized the dust as the Bone-smashing Powder with Ten Flavors. This was a truly vile drug that overpowered a victim paralyzing tendons, muscles, and bones in a short time, resulting in weak limbs.</p>

  <p>Rather than give up and be burned alive, Luo Luo Zheng had decided that at the chance, he would steal the Hell Fire Sword, smash the weapons refining furnace and do all he could to defeat Evil Lan. 'Damn it all to hell!' he thought, as he watched his plan go up in smoke, all because of the damned Bone-smashing Powder with Ten Flavors. Luo Luo Zheng felt like his body turning weak, soft and worse, it affected his internal life energy, leaving him unable to lift a finger.</p>

  <p>'Is this it? Does my life end here?</p>

  <p>Once a predator, now the prey. I have only myself to blame for being this weak! My flaw was I let myself be bullied, and now I can't even reconcile myself with events.'</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth, and a desperate look was on his face. In the midst of his thoughts, a flame burst up in the middle of the weapons refining furnace.</p>

  <p>The bright, yellow flames reminded Luo Luo Zheng of a fiery yellow lotus, and Luo Luo Zheng realized they must be the fire of Evil Lan.</p>

  <p>The fire spread almost instantly when it appeared, filling the space of the weapon refining furnace. Luo Luo Zheng felt the heat on his face, and quickly realized he was enveloped in the flames.</p>

  <p>"Ss-izz-zle!"</p>

  <p>He heard the sound as his clothes ignited, and instantly burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>As the flames engulfed his flesh, he felt the heat, and as he began to sweat, Luo Luo Zheng shut his eyes, bit down preparing for pain. After what felt like a long time, he didn't feel any pain and wondered, 'What's going on?</p>

  <p>That's strange!' There was a slight amount of heat, not even enough to make him feel more than minor discomfort.</p>
