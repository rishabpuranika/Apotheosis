<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2188 Infinity Ruler </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the divine city, he had been extremely cautious.</p>

  <p>Since the Emotion Closing Divine Dao was classified as a forbidden Divine Dao, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't use it randomly, nor would he use it in the presence of a large crowd.</p>

  <p>When he had used his spiritual will to form a soul attack in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, Luo Luo Zheng had also erased the sharp Mu Ning within his soul? it could only be called the enhanced version of the Spiritual Thorn.</p>

  <p>In the face of this sword array attack forming from the internal momentum, Luo Luo Zheng did not dodge? he instead allowed the sword shadows to enter his mind.</p>

  <p>When these sword shadows gathered within his mind and formed into a sword array, the small golden swords on the surface of Luo Zheng's soul instantly radiated with boundless light. As the strands of golden light reverberated in his mind, they shattered all the sword shadows.</p>

  <p>The eyes were the windows to the soul. While the golden light of his soul flashed, Luo Luo Zheng had already closed his eyes and covered it within his mind.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes again, everything had returned to normal.</p>

  <p>The scene left May flabbergasted? she thought that Luo Luo Zheng had some sort of precious treasures that could protect his soul, letting him forego dodging. Judging from Luo Zheng's innate talent and performance, it was highly possible.</p>

  <p>Never did she expect Luo Luo Zheng to lack such a thing. But instead, he allowed the sword array from the internal momentum's pressure to pierce his mind.</p>

  <p>Just as she worried about Luo Luo Zheng taking mental damage, he had already regained his composure and had taken another step as if nothing even happened.</p>

  <p>"No wonder the old man from the Floating Island thinks so highly of him," May murmured. As she thought about her own fate, she couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know May was so sentimental? as he continued climbing, the pressure from the internal momentum began turning into all sorts of things, disappearing into Luo Zheng's mind one by one.</p>

  <p>There were nine-floor purple pagodas, ten thousand giant swords, and a two-headed serpent. The materialized purple mist had turned into everything, but no matter what shape it took, they were all materialized from the pressure of the internal momentum? their power couldn't have been too far off from each other.</p>

  <p>As these things drilled into his mind, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but close his eyes and kill them with his soul pressure once again.</p>

  <p>But there were simply too many of them. Waves after waves of attacks flowed into his mind and Luo Luo Zheng only shut his eyes tightly and used his spiritual sense to figure out his surroundings. He then continued to climb the stairs and quicken his pace.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred steps under each Divine Dao Tablets. Most proving godly warriors could only stay on the 50th to 60th steps, like May, who stood on the 52nd step. If she advanced, the pressure on her would multiply to a point she could no longer bear.</p>

  <p>But with Luo Zheng's rapid climbing, he had already reached the ninetieth step.</p>

  <p>"Does the guy want to climb to the top?"</p>

  <p>"In theory, the closer you are to the Divine Dao Tablet, the easier it is to communicate with it. But the pressure is too great up there?How would you even comprehend it under such great pressure?"</p>

  <p>"You're mistaken! Let me remind you again? he's a man. He can't cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>For a time, many proving godly warriors couldn't focus on comprehending the Divine Dao Tablets and instead wasted their attention on Luo Luo Zheng. They all wanted to know just what the guy was trying to accomplish.</p>

  <p>Under the crowd's watchful eyes, Luo Luo Zheng rushed up to the stage on the top floor.</p>

  <p>The moment he stood on the stage, the purple Mu Ning on the Divine Dao Tablet became increasingly restless, flooding in like a tide. There was no time for it to form into something before entering Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It was as if his head had turned into a black hole? the purple Mu Ning was pouring in continuously.</p>

  <p>After a long while?</p>

  <p>It was probably because the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablet had been consumed too much. The internal momentum finally calmed down, ceasing its surge toward Luo Luo Zheng. Instead, it continued to slowly circulate the Divine Dao Tablet's surface, no longer posing any threat.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Luo Zheng open his eyes and look at the Divine Dao Tablet in silence.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique can transform the purple Mu Ning into an auspicious place and create a world of its own. There are three types of this operation among all living things. It is the development of the natural laws. It may not defy the divine will and it..."</p>

  <p>Beautiful were the purple characters recorded on the Divine Dao Tablet? a woman must have created the Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng began to understand the token of the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique after his observations.</p>

  <p>It was, in fact, another manifestation of life vitality. But it had inherited some of the chaotic energy's abilities, such as creating a new world.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World in the Evolutionary Universe was isolated? its rules were completely different from those of other supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Back then, it was created by a True God who had cultivated the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique.</p>

  <p>The world constructed from it was different from the inner world? cultivating the deep part of the technique allowed one to open up a new world within the divine land. Although this world could not be compared to the universe, it was still stronger than the ordinary inner world. So when a True God cultivated the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique to its peak, they could, in turn be called a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>But the control this technique required was most profound? True Gods who cultivated this Divine Dao specialized most in sword arrays, so Mu Ning learned how to arrange sword arrays in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>"Although Yan's Purple Power Body was bestowed upon her by father, I wonder if she managed to cultivate the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique or step into the other Divine Dao? I wonder if father has any other plans for this..."</p>

  <p>Even now, Luo Zheng's father's plans were still shrouded in layers of clouds? he didn't know what sort of considerations Mike had in mind and clearly, Mike didn't want him to uncover the reasons. He just put Murphy, a great Holy Being, in front of him.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was deep in thought, a fluctuation suddenly came to his mind.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler in the depths of his mind began spinning slowly.</p>

  <p>Then, a ghostly light began flickering from one end of the Infinity Ruler before moving about on the scales packed densely on it. Finally, it stopped on a scale right in the middle.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment the light stopped on the scale, a blazing light burst out like flames? it was as if the sun had burned itself out to its limit, leaving behind a trace of brilliance.</p>

  <p>"What, what is that..."</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's mind, Master Evil was so shocked at the scene. Being in Luo Zheng's head, he had already discovered the green jade ruler. Even though Master Evil was experienced and knowledgeable, he did not know where the ruler came from. But Master Evil was tactful enough not to question Luo Luo Zheng about it. He was just not expecting this jade ruler to explode with such force at that moment.</p>

  <p>A blazing radiance burst out, shining from Luo Zheng's eyes? his black pupils seemed to be on fire as a ring of blazing light formed around the edges of his orbs, dazzling brightly.</p>

  <p>Without a clue of what had happened, Luo Luo Zheng looked completely astonished.</p>

  <p>But after the change in his eyes, the Divine Dao Tablet he saw was then completely different. The words on its surface changed? they began twisting and distorting as the purple light condensed from the internal momentum began fluctuating frantically.</p>

  <p>"Ah, what's going on?!"</p>

  <p>Standing on the stairs, May was surprised at the scene.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's actions were strange, May was still working hard on her own comprehension? she was hurrying to comprehend the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablet, so she paid little attention to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Luo Zheng glared at the Divine Dao Tablet with blazing eyes, turning the internal momentum on it into a mess. May was no longer able to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to cause a huge commotion either, the seemingly calm and peaceful Infinity Ruler suddenly turned 'abnormal' in front of the Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>At this time, it wasn't only the proving godly warriors who paid attention to Luo Luo Zheng? even the leader of the Heavenly Han House and the other True Gods were quietly watching him from a corner. Each and every one of their expressions read 'wonderful.'</p>

  <p>"What kind of secrets does this Tianxing have?!"</p>

  <p>"That fellow's eyes... It seems to be the Fire God Eyes?"</p>

  <p>"They're definitely not the Fire God Eyes! Otherwise, how could he have messed up the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablet? The Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique's Divine Dao Tablet was personally crafted by Joy Han. The internal momentum within is much deeper than the internal momentum of other Divine Dao Tablets."</p>

  <p>Joy was a True God at the consummation level. In addition to Han Clan's Holy Emperor, there was also a Demi-holy Being called Joy in this clan.</p>

  <p>While the Purple Sky Land she created wasn't as big as a universe, it had made her strength much greater than other True Gods at the same level.</p>

  <p>But the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablet had already turned into a mess? the purple characters were showing signs of crumbling and the deepest comprehension hidden within the internal momentum had turned into a purple light before quietly entering Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>
