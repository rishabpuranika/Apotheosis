<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was painfully tense.</p>

  <p>Those ordinary humans were moving in an orderly manner towards the direction that Zheng had pointed to. In their minds, as long as they followed his instructions, they were going to be perfectly safe and no problem could befall them.</p>

  <p>The strongest among all the creatures present was definitely the ogre war lord. There were more than twenty war generals from the human race, and two war generals were from the Demon Night. However, even two war generals of the last category were quite powerful and their strengths were not to be looked down upon. In fact, even the ogre war lord might not win if the human war generals and the Demon Night war generals fought together against him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone was waiting for the reinforcements behind them.</p>

  <p>They all had their own plans in mind, and Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>Zheng had met the human warriors, and judging from the looks of the current situation, he could tell that the human warriors on this chaotic continent weren't strong. He wasn't willing to place his life in someone else's hands right now, and even if he was, the human warriors were not a good choice.</p>

  <p>As for the Demon Night, although they did not have much of enmity towards him and had even said that they would protect him, they still belonged to a different race. He did not believe that just because his sword spirit was a member of the Demon Night, they would treat him well.</p>

  <p>As for the ogres, they weren't going to let him go by any means.</p>

  <p>While he was pondering over the current situation, two more huge figures appeared from the direction of the ogre war lord. Even from afar, everyone could feel their imposing manners as their figures grew larger.</p>

  <p>The instant the two new ogre war lords appeared, the forceful energy within Zheng's body erupted as he shot forwards at a high speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was much stronger than the other creatures present, so his reaction was also the fastest.</p>

  <p>Only after he had shot out did many of the creatures react.</p>

  <p>When the first ogre war lord sensed his companions' aura, a sinister smile appeared on his face. Before he could even say anything to his companions, Zheng had run away. His expression darkened, and his body swayed as he chased after Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not afford his reactions to be slow. Although there were as many as twenty human war generals, they weren't going to be a match for the ogres. As for the Demon Night, there were only two of them. He would be an idiot if he didn't run away right now.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was escaping, his advantage of cultivating both body and life vitality was finally revealed.</p>

  <p>Just now, the forceful energy within his body had suddenly erupted, and his figure had instantly turned into a thin line that streaked across the horizon.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, he had traveled over ten miles.</p>

  <p>In addition to the forceful energy, the life vitality within Zheng's body was also stimulated as he streaked across the plain, causing his speed to increase again.</p>

  <p>This was the benefit of cultivating both his body and life vitality. The forceful energy was suitable for traveling over short distances and it also contained the talent of the Cloud-chasing Lion, which made him even faster. The life vitality was suitable for long-distance flying, allowing him to maintain the high speed he had attained.</p>

  <p>In addition, Zheng had also activated the energy within the Phoenix Crystal embedded in his body. At his current strength and speed, the increase in speed achieved by using the Phoenix Crystal was negligible, but right now, he was trying to escape and wanted to leave no stone unturned.</p>

  <p>A war lord on this continent was equivalent to a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>In the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, Zheng had defeated a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. That was the prince of the divine kingdom. And he was no weak enemy. Though his cultivation was at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he could defeat a warrior at the middle stage and even match a warrior at the late stage of the same realm.</p>

  <p>However, the biggest reason why Zheng had been able to defeat him was that the prince's cultivation level had been suppressed by the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Thus, the prince's apparent strength had been only equivalent to a warrior at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, he was unable to contend against even one ogre war lord, not to mention the fact that he had three ogre war lords chasing after him.</p>

  <p>If the three ogre war lords caught up to him, Zheng would definitely die.</p>

  <p>He had to run as far as he could.</p>

  <p>When the first ogre war lord saw Zheng escape, he immediately chased after him at a rapid pace. With his own cultivation level coupled with the eruption of his forceful energy, he wasn't any slower than Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the two other ogre war lords who had come to provide assistance chased after Zheng at a mad pace too.</p>

  <p>As for the group of human war generals, each and every single one of them had a very complicated expression. Although they had been told to protect Zheng, they couldn't stand up against even a single ogre war lord, let alone three of them at once.</p>

  <p>If the three ogre war lords turned around and pursued them, not a single one of more than twenty human war generals would survive.</p>

  <p>Right now, they could do nothing but look on helplessly.</p>

  <p>Although the human race did not move, the people of the Demon Night seemed like they were going to act. The young lady called Phoebe turned around and ran in a circle in the dense forest before placing the huge bone bow behind her.</p>

  <p>"Inform Elder Mei and have her track me," Phoebe suddenly shouted and jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Wind!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Phoebe was proficient in a wind related cultivation method. With a gust of wind, she condensed a pair of light green wings behind her and soared into the sky, chasing after the ogre war lords.</p>

  <p>The life vitality in Zheng's body revolved unceasingly, and he madly rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Even though he had raised his speed to the maximum, the distance between him and the ogre war lords was constantly decreasing and they were going to catch up to him soon.</p>

  <p>"Trying to run away from me is just a dream, boy! Ha-ha." As the first ogre war lord spoke, the forceful energy within his body suddenly exploded even more furiously, instantly increasing his speed by another thirty percent. His distance with Zheng was now getting shorter at an even faster pace.</p>

  <p>The wind blew past Zheng's ears. His eyebrows were furrowed tightly.</p>

  <p>He had already traveled over a hundred miles, but the distance between him and the first ogre war lord was getting threateningly short.</p>

  <p>10, 000 feet, 5, 000 feet, 2, 000 feet, 1, 000 feet, 500 feet, 100 feet...</p>

  <p>When the distance between the two was reduced to a certain extent, the ogre war lord grinned wickedly, preparing to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Forceful energy, explode!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that the distance between them was getting dangerously short, Zheng once again released the forceful energy within his body, thereby increasing the distance between his enemy and himself once again.</p>

  <p>In a situation where both his forceful energy and life vitality erupted at the same time, Zheng's speed was actually not inferior to that of the ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>However, the forceful energy could not be used continuously. Furthermore, once it was used up, he could only wait for his physical body to slowly generate the forceful energy and had no other means to regenerate it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng was afraid to use it continuously.</p>

  <p>Of course, it wasn't just Zheng who was facing this problem. The three ogre war lords behind him were also bothered by the same situation. They also practiced the forceful energy system and focused on body refinement, so they had the advantage in short-distance flight. But once they faced the long-distance flight, they were not as skillful as Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Zheng were to use his life vitality to fly, he could maintain his speed at a distance of over 10, 000 miles. On the other hand, those ogre war lords could only maintain their speeds for a distance of 1, 000 to 2, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>What Zheng needed to do was run as far as he could. Once he had exceeded the ogre war lords' limits, he would be safe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, every time the ogre war lords approached Zheng, he would use the forceful energy within his body and suddenly accelerate to a distance away from them. When the forceful energy was depleted, he would then use his life vitality to maintain his flight.</p>

  <p>Running on and on, he repeated this process several times. He had already run over a thousand miles by this point.</p>

  <p>During this process, the life vitality within Zheng's body was being rapidly consumed. As the life vitality within his body ran out, he took out a supreme life vitality crystal and crushed it in his mouth. Then, he absorbed all of the life vitality within it.</p>

  <p>Life vitality could be replenished with supreme life vitality crystals, but forceful energy couldn't.</p>

  <p>This was the downside of being a body refiner.</p>

  <p>The life vitality system relied on the condensed life vitality from the heaven and earth to stimulate the cultivation method. But, the forceful energy system relied entirely on the eruption of one's own forceful energy. Forceful energy could only be produced by one's own body and couldn't be replenished by anything outside the body.</p>

  <p>The higher one's cultivation level was, the faster his or her recovery of forceful energy was.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng, powerful as he was, was still not very high up in cultivation level, his biggest problem right now was that his forceful energy was soon going to be depleted.</p>

  <p>The explosion of forceful energy could cause his speed to increase, but ordinary forceful energy did not increase Zheng's speed that much. Only after circulating the forceful energy in his body through the Hundred Meetings Platform could he inherit the Cloud-chasing Lion's innate talent and burst forth with an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's forceful energy was gradually weakening, and his speed was also becoming slower and slower. However, the speed of the ogre war lords behind him did not seem to be decreasing in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Right now, the ogre war lord closet to Zheng was only seventy to eighty feet away.</p>

  <p>"Well done. You actually managed to give us a chase of over a thousand miles at such a fast speed. You really surprise me, human. But whatever the case, I will capture you and send you to the ogre's sacred place to see just what and how many secrets you have on you." The ogre war lord teased him with a sneer. "Now, stop!"</p>

  <p>He waved his fist and launched an attack at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, the soul in Zheng's mind left his body once again. It flew towards the ogre war lord behind him, turning into a sharp thorn that drilled into his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul could directly exterminate a war general, but he was not very confident that it could do the same when facing the ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>In any case, since he was caught off-guard, the ogre war lord got frightened.</p>

  <p>His speed became slower, and his huge head slightly tilted to the side, avoiding Zheng's soul attack.</p>

  <p>"A soul at the Fighting Soul Realm?" The ogre war lord's expression was both ugly and astonished. "This human brat really is a freak!"</p>
