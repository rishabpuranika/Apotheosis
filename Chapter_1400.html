<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Had it been any other Soul Sea Realm warrior, his body would have already been shattered by the force of Lincoln's punch.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors that had been smashed by Lincoln's punch in the Villain World was countless by now. It was only because of his Metal Spirit Body that he was able to survive all his battles to this day.</p>

  <p>Lincoln was well aware of his power, and took great pride in it. He had almost forgotten what it felt like to be surprised by an opponent? he did not have much reason to be, until today. The moment Lincoln came into contact with Luo Luo Zheng, his body vibrated with a strength that was as vast and immeasurable as the ocean.</p>

  <p>The golden light on his body faltered, and he retreated on the platform.</p>

  <p>It was only when he reached the edge that he stopped.</p>

  <p>'Such power! This brat's physical body is actually stronger than mine!' he thought in disbelief, and a look of bewilderment appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Every cultivation method had its own unique characteristics. He couldn't be certain which law Luo Luo Zheng focused on, but it was definitely not the Metal Law. For warriors who practiced the Metal Law, their greatest pride lay in the Body in the Diamond-like State.</p>

  <p>How come Luo Luo Zheng was able to make his body so tough?</p>

  <p>In his puzzlement, Lincoln failed to notice his opponent. Luo Luo Zheng stood on the other side of the platform, his face mirroring Lincoln's own surprise.</p>

  <p>He had already used the strength of 8, 000 dragon scales in the punch that he threw earlier.</p>

  <p>An ordinary warrior at the Soul Sea Realm would not be able to withstand the power of just 2, 000 to 3, 000 dragon scales. Even War Emperor York had been forced back by a single strike from him. 8, 000 dragon scales was out of the question. Had the War Emperor been hit with this power, he would have been killed immediately.</p>

  <p>He observed Lincoln from where he was. His opponent had been forced to retreat, but other than that, he showed no other sign of damage.</p>

  <p>Lincoln's strength was turning out to be much stronger than he had expected.</p>

  <p>Outside the ancient palace, the scene was punctuated with sighs from the spectating warriors. Close combats such as this always turned out to be among the most gruesome. The air shifted around the warriors as they watched. No blood had been drawn as of yet. They had no longer been thinking about the outcome of the battle. Instead, they were looking to see more blood.</p>

  <p>"So this is your trump card," Lincoln said, his eyes sharply fixed at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your body is comparable to a divine weapon, and you possess terrifying strength." His lips split into a broad smile and he continued, "However, this alone might not be enough to win against me!" The confident glint was back in his eyes, although one could tell that he was exercising more caution.</p>

  <p>The next moment, a crack broke in his forehead, revealing a small cyan stone.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed the cyan stone, and his face also revealed a trace of wariness.</p>

  <p>At this time, he heard Xun speak to him. "Be careful, Luo Luo Zheng. That stone you see is the Wrath of the Ocean."</p>

  <p>"The Wrath of the Ocean? What is that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Xun didn't have much time to answer his question.</p>

  <p>"There's not enough time to explain. It's something with a great history.</p>

  <p>Once this Wrath of the Ocean is activated, one's strength will increase exponentially. This is truly strange. Humans have actually arranged such a difficult trial in Passing the Torch."</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Sunset World lord's gaze froze at the sight of the stone in Lincoln's forehead. "The siblings both have the rare Wrath of the Ocean. Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>One of the palace leaders asked, "Since Layla has the fate to lead the world of chaos, what of her elder brother?"</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head at his question. "I'm afraid we would have to ask someone to inquire further before we can tell his fate."</p>

  <p>Upon discovering that the Wrath of the Ocean was something of extraordinary power, Luo Luo Zheng naturally became even more vigilant. He fixed his eyes on Lincoln, watching for every small movement. Just as the two men were about to approach each other, a woman's shout echoed through the space, slicing sharply at the silence.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! I'm not in the mood for your pestering. Die!"</p>

  <p>Layla's fury hardened her voice as she shouted. Ever since she saw her elder brother, she had lost all desire to fight. However, her opponent was persistent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Lincoln halted their movements, their gazes shifting to Layla's side.</p>

  <p>Countless ghost heads surrounded Layla with gusts of cold wind, forcing her into a corner.</p>

  <p>"This is a trial, little girl. There's no way I don't fight you," her opponent said. "But if you want to admit defeat, that's fine too!"</p>

  <p>Layla's anger boiled over, flowing hotly into her veins.</p>

  <p>Throwing the cyan long sword to the side, she flipped in the air, her long hair leaving a graceful trail. The crack in her forehead grew larger and larger, and the cyan stone shone with a strange light.</p>

  <p>Rays of cyan light surrounded her. The next moment, a small spot between her eyebrows exploded.</p>

  <p>The moment he looked at the spot of light, Luo Luo Zheng was overcome with the sense of extreme danger. That ball of light was an absolute threat to his life.</p>

  <p>As the people watched, the light spot suddenly enlarged and turned into a ball. It kept on expanding until it was the size of a person. Then, it wrapped itself around Layla.</p>

  <p>Once the light had completely enveloped her, it pulsated and began to rapidly grow larger once more.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the entire platform was engulfed in its light.</p>

  <p>With the light covering the entire space, Layla's opponent had nowhere to flee. He could only raise his hand against the blinding light as it swallowed him.</p>

  <p>The cyan light ball pulsated and sent forth a blinding light, forcing the people to close their eyes. When the large light ball slowly scattered, even Luo Luo Zheng could not help but suck in a deep, much-wanted breath.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The round platforms within the Illusion Space were built on stone pillars.</p>

  <p>Because the space's nature, the objects inside weren't real. They were created using divine textures and magic arrays. Warriors' strength was taken into account upon the building of the structure.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, these platforms were impossible to destroy.</p>

  <p>Even after having endured countless battles, these platforms were left unscathed. They had been built to withstand long and violent battles.</p>

  <p>No one would have ever expected what came into their sight after the light dissipated. Layla's opponent was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>So was the whole platform. A sole pillar stood in the middle of the space.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for that, it would have been as if the platform had never existed at all. The stone pillar had a concave on the surface that was eroded by the light. Layla was sitting atop it as her hair was scattered down.</p>

  <p>Her face had a pallid complexion as she stared in Luo Zheng's direction. It was evident that whatever she had done used up quite a bit of her energy. It had burned even her blood essence.</p>

  <p>Everything was only a projection in the Illusion Space. Even burning one's blood essence wasn't too much of a matter. "Lincoln, you can do it!" she shouted.</p>

  <p>With what had just happened, Layla had as good as passed the final test.</p>

  <p>However, after considering the situation, the old man in cotton clothes did not make her leave the Illusion Space, allowing her to stay there and watch the battle between her brother and Luo Luo Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Willow Island, Adrian's brows furrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>A bad premonition came to him as he watched.</p>

  <p>He had not the slightest interest about the relationship between Lincoln and Layla. All he wanted was for Lincoln to defeat Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had thought that Layla was inferior to Luo Luo Zheng. However, now that she had displayed such power, it had left Adrian astonished. At the same time, he grew anxious about Lincoln. He didn't want him to lose the battle.</p>

  <p>"No matter how hard we try, some things just won't go as we wish. Fate is cruel," he muttered, shaking his head. His mind was resigned to whatever the outcome of the fight would be.</p>

  <p>Lincoln smiled faintly. His chest was filled with pride for his sister. After the Wrath of the Ocean was activated, the golden light around his body shone even brighter. He clenched his fists and turned to Luo Luo Zheng. "Fight me!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head in response. A silent understanding passed over the two men. The outcome of this battle was no longer important. Lincoln was as proud as Layla, but he was principled.</p>

  <p>It would not be easy to meet such an opponent. Luo Zheng's body thrummed with excitement. His gaze turned more serious as he looked at Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Then, in the boundless starry sky of the Orange Sea World, a few rays of starlight suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>These stars had always hung above the universe, shining down upon the countless supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>But they were not visible due to their great distance. Such eye-catching luster was not often seen by human eyes.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, those few rays of starlight shot straight towards the ancient hall.</p>

  <p>At almost the exact instant that the stars flickered, the Sunset World lord frowned, and the expression on his face grew from bewilderment to shock. "Don't tell me Luo Luo Zheng has cultivated the Stellar Body?"</p>

  <p>A palace leader echoed his surprise. "It's the Transcendent Divine Might that Supreme Lord Star had left behind many years ago. Where did Luo Luo Zheng learn it from?"</p>
