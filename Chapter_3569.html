  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the three floors of the Land of Sword Grief represented the three stages of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Rocco did not use his full strength--but the power he had just unleashed was impossible for someone who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm to resist.</p>

  <p>They said that Luo Zheng had just entered the Land of Sword Grief less than two months ago, so he also entered the Chaotic Source Realm not long ago?</p>

  <p>It should be impossible...</p>

  <p>His Chaotic Source Spirits weren't exhausted yet after they took his punch.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng was at the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, but how did he reach this stage in just two months?</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility. Many years ago, Luo Zheng had already stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm, but the Land of Sword Grief had just recently received him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Rocco joined the Land of Sword Grief long after he had entered the Chaotic Source Realm. Although his case was rare, it still existed.</p>

  <p>"How long?" Luo Zheng didn't expect for Rocco to ask about such a thing. He lowered his head and thought for a while, then he said, "About three months."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, Rocco's face darkened. "Do you think I'm a fool?</p>

  <p>It's impossible for you to get to the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm in around three months!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>He refused to believe Luo Zheng's words at all!</p>

  <p>The new disciples around the arena began to speak and assure him that Luo Zheng was correct.</p>

  <p>"Just only three months. Luo Zheng is one of us!"</p>

  <p>"How could it be wrong as we all entered the Chaotic Source World together?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Exactly speaking, it's three months and nine days!"</p>

  <p>At the sight of those disciples' affirmative looks, Rocco was completely confused.</p>

  <p>Just then, Yusuf who was on the second floor said loudly, "Rocco, Luo Zheng is a disciple of our Heart Flow Sect! He is indeed one of those disciples who have just entered the Chaotic Source Realm."</p>

  <p>Since Rocco knew Yusuf, he knew that the man wouldn't lie to him.</p>

  <p>After Yusuf's confirmation, Rocco was even more confused. He stared curiously at Luo Zheng and asked, "Then how did you do it?"</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one who was dumbfounded. Some people with insight even guessed that Luo Zheng had made rapid progress ever since he had obtained the Chaotic Source Spirits. There must be some secrets he was hiding!</p>

  <p>Then again, there was actually a limit to the "rapid progress" that everyone believed. They had thought he might be only two times faster than the others.</p>

  <p>But now, Rocco believed that Luo Zheng had stepped into the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. That was not the kind of rapid progress they had thought!</p>

  <p>To put it simply, that was super rapid progress!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked nonchalantly at Rocco and said, "You have also stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm. Why did you ask such a naive question?"</p>

  <p>In order to become stronger, warriors naturally tried every means possible to improve. Moreover, it wasn't unusual that everyone had their own secrets. Why would they expose their secrets to other people anyway?</p>

  <p>As for the secret of the True Enlightenment, Luo Zheng could expose it to the Taiyi Heaven Palace to make contributions to the orthodox swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But, how could he tell the others the secrets of his body and the Truth of Divine Dao?</p>

  <p>"Naive?" Rocco hissed.</p>

  <p>"Since you don't want to tell me, then I guess I'll have to investigate it myself!"</p>

  <p>When he was done speaking, he took a step forward.</p>

  <p>A strange ripple appeared inside the whole arena. The ripple seemed to have come from a feather-light step, but it actually contained a great amount of power. Suddenly, Rocco had disappeared in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples on the first floor below the arena couldn't see Rocco.</p>

  <p>Only a few people on the second floor had thought of looking up, and saw Rocco's figure flying above.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng hesitated just for a second when he saw Rocco disappear. Then ripples appeared in the arena again. He was now in the center of the ripples!</p>

  <p>"He's up there!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng instinctively looked up, but he quickly frowned.</p>

  <p>"It's too late," said Yusuf as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That guy can't avoid this step." The fair-skinned man echoed Yusuf's sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Rocco is very serious this time. His step may contain 7, 000 Jun of the Other Shore Power. I'm afraid that Luo Zheng might end up disabled!" Ronnie agreed.</p>

  <p>No matter how talented Luo Zheng was, his skills were still too far from Rocco's.</p>

  <p>If he could constantly dodge and consume Rocco's strength, then he might have a slight chance of winning. However, it was almost impossible to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng realized that, he had no room to dodge. Of course, the consequences of withstanding such attacks weren't hard to imagine.</p>

  <p>However, some of the disciples on the first floor who watched the fight felt differently about it.</p>

  <p>Some of them looked pleased to see Luo Zheng in misfortune. But Feng Ge and her companions were genuinely worried and actually cared about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was known that Rocco was the number one warrior on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was too difficult for Luo Zheng to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng did not have the slightest intention of dodging this time!</p>

  <p>He slightly tilted his body, then the Civilization Artifact released majestic Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>He knew that even if the Green Jade Civilization was restrained in Stage Thirteen, its Civilization Artifact could still unleash eight thousand Jun of force!</p>

  <p>Back when he had been previously limited by his physical body, he could only use such a powerful force while activating the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>Now as he had stepped into the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, his Chaotic Source Spirits were able to bear four to five thousand Jun of force. Furthermore, the Truth of Divine Dao in his body could greatly increase the Chaotic Source Spirits' ability to contain force.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact finally unleashed the Other Shore Power contained inside it. Almost all of the Chaotic Source Spirits in Luo Zheng's body were maxed out to the limit, while the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits swelled up one by one and bulged on his skin.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits were almost on the edge of exhaustion, but at the same time, he infused them with the Truth of Divine Dao to maintain their original state.</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand Jun of force!"</p>

  <p>At that point, he directed his punch straight to Rocco's foot sole!</p>

  <p>Yet, Rocco didn't take Luo Zheng's attack seriously. The truth was, he wanted to cripple Luo Zheng, then find the secret of rapid progress from him. If he could really know this secret, he would have a chance to get a place on the third floor and perhaps even defeat Li Bianxue, an unrivaled talent and the strongest warrior on that floor.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped down, however, he felt a strong force come from his right foot. He could tell that the force was stronger than his own!</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" Rocco exclaimed in utter shock. "Click! Click!</p>

  <p>Click!"</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits that glimmered in Rocco's body were immediately extinguished.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the force had rapidly spread from his right leg to his whole body!</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>In the next second, the power that hadn't been offset by his Chaotic Source Spirits started to invade his whole being.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the force that went up along his right leg travelled to his right arm and the right side of his body, then broke them with a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>Almost without any resistance, he miserably fell out of the arena with a soft thud.</p>

  <p>Nothing but silence filled the whole land.</p>
