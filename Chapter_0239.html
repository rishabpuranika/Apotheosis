<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 239 The Trial In The Immortal Mansion (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally, it would be quite hard for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat an Illuminating Soul Realm master, simply because being half-step into the nature level was far from an Illuminating Soul Realm master's skills. In the battle to the death, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't have won if Seymour hadn't been badly injured.</p>

  <p>Even for today, it was a pyrrhic triumph for Luo Luo Zheng. But in any case, no matter how hard it was, Luo Luo Zheng had persisted until the end.</p>

  <p>Just in that moment, a series of dull sounds came from the Eight Diagrams. Luo Luo Zheng looked up at the source of those sounds and saw that the statues had slowly moved away from the characters, and finally returned to their original forms.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng didn't sense any danger from the statues' movements, he sat still on the ground to recover. After a short while of rest, he stood up.</p>

  <p>His eyes scanned all the bodies of the Illuminating Soul Realm masters, and a sigh couldn't help but escape from his lips. If only they had believed him, the situation wouldn't have escalated out of their control.</p>

  <p>'Ah, time can't be reversed. They might never believe me in such a zero-sum game anyway, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he sighed again. He bent down and started to pick up the weapons in their unmoving hands. These weapons were of high value and strength and among them were quite a lot of low-level spiritual weapons, a small number of medium-level spiritual weapons, and even a top-grade one!</p>

  <p>Since all of them were dead, the weapons now all belonged to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He carefully collected all the weapons and other valuable items and stored them into his space ring. Before he proceeded to the statues, he bent over the deceased bodies of his rivals and stood in silent tribute for a while.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he went and moved the statues based on the method recorded by Chase.</p>

  <p>'Three for Heaven, ' murmured Luo Luo Zheng, and then he pushed three statues to word 'Heaven'.</p>

  <p>'Six for Earth, ' then, he pushed the other six statues to word 'Earth' accordingly.</p>

  <p>'For the Water is...'</p>

  <p>'For the Fire is...'</p>

  <p>'The last one is...'</p>

  <p>One by one, Luo Luo Zheng had pushed all the statues to their corresponding pisitions as stated in Chase's record. After all of the movements were completed, the Eight Diagrams engraved on the ground slowly started to turn.</p>

  <p>The outer ring of the Eight Diagrams turned several times until a clear sound of gear transmission could be heard.</p>

  <p>"Brum!" At this point, it seemed that the outer ring's cogwheel had geared towards the inner ring of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>After the gassy sound stopped, the inner ring started to rotate this time.</p>

  <p>"Brum!" The other sound of the gear resonated again from the inner ring.</p>

  <p>The two sounds had Luo Luo Zheng withhold his breath. And his eyes were closely transfixed on the Eight Diagrams. He was so engrossed in the observation that he didn't even blink. It didn't take long before the Eight Diagrams flashed rays of white light.</p>

  <p>'Oh yeah! I made it!' Luo Luo Zheng mentally exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He couldn't hide the utter delight that sparkled in his eyes.</p>

  <p>When the euphoria passed, he started to wonder what would happen next after the Eight Diagrams had been opened. His heart fluttered wildly in his ribcage as he scrutinized every movement of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>Although he closely monitored its actions, he was still on high alert for any potential attacks.</p>

  <p>The white light gradually faded away after a while, and then a human-shaped figure appeared in the center of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched the figure carefully and upon closer look, he found that this human-shaped figure was not a real human. It was a puppet, but as far as Luo Luo Zheng was concerned, this puppet was the only normal thing in this Immortal Mansion. It looked like the human-shaped puppet was of a human's average height, much like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He finally stopped watching the puppet closely and waited for its next move. After a while, the puppet began to speak in a low but excited voice.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand years! I haven't seen a human for three thousand years!</p>

  <p>Finally, one person appeared and opened the Eight Diagrams!"</p>

  <p>His rich tones echoed throughout the rocky walls.</p>

  <p>The puppet's words took Luo Luo Zheng by surprise. 'The puppet can speak!' he thought. Even though the puppet didn't seem to show any aggressive behavior, Luo Luo Zheng stayed alert and kept his distance. It seemed that aside from being able to talk, the puppet could also express excitement.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Luo Zheng asked carefully in a calm, polite manner.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng guessed he was a puppet, he still chose to show his full respect to him.</p>

  <p>The puppet was mildly astonished before he answered.</p>

  <p>"Me? Wow, my name? Oh! You can call me Saul. Yes, I am Saul. I am the servant of this Immortal Mansion," he said.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the puppet hadn't talked for a long time. So, his words came out a little too excitedly and he appeared quite talkative.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Luo Zheng nodded courteously.</p>

  <p>"Saul? Thanks. Would you mind if I ask, are you a human or a puppet? I am sorry if my question would offend you," Luo Luo Zheng said. Now, it wasn't the first time that Luo Luo Zheng saw a puppet. However, even those best craftsmen could only make puppets that could only walk and move under their masters' commands. Such a puppet that could speak and feel like a normal human was indeed rare to see or hear. So, it was no wonder that Luo Luo Zheng suspected Saul was a human in disguise.</p>

  <p>The human-like puppet Saul's eyes were slightly downcast before he spoke. "Me? Of course, I am a puppet?but how I wish I could be a real human. Then I can become old with time and die when the life ends. Not like now, living for ever and ever is the greatest torture," he lamented.</p>

  <p>His previous excitement was now replaced by sorrow and grief, and Saul's mood became sour and gloomy.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his answer, Luo Luo Zheng felt a little confused. "We practice martial arts to seek immortality, and you have reached our ultimate objective and now live in this Immortal Mansion. Why are you looking for death? I could not understand that," he asked.</p>

  <p>In turn, Saul only smiled sadly and sighed. "If you were trapped in one place, every day without company--you could only talk to yourself, you would finally not want to talk or even just forget how to speak. I have been alone for thousands of years and would live lonely for the next few thousand years or even longer. Will you still want to live immortally? Or will you look for death, which might be a relief and an end to your current lonely life?"</p>

  <p>Saul's gripes made Luo Luo Zheng fall into silence. He did have a fair point. To be alone for thousands of years like Saul would make immortality a great torture. And death might be the next best thing. However, Luo Luo Zheng was a human who understood the feeling of loneliness, but Saul was a puppet.</p>

  <p>So, he asked again, "Saul, you are only a puppet, how could you feel lonely?"</p>

  <p>Saul just shook his head. "Even though my body was made to be a puppet, my inner soul was an abstract from a human soul. Thus, in some words, I am also a human, with human feelings and soul," he answered.</p>

  <p>Abstract human soul to refine a puppet!</p>

  <p>That was so strange that Luo Luo Zheng had never heard about it. Such technique was so magical that it was almost unbelievable.</p>

  <p>When Saul saw Luo Zheng's shocked expression, he didn't mind as if he was used to such a thing. "Anyway, I have finally seen you after three thousand years?</p>

  <p>I finally saw the fourth person appearing here after waiting for three thousand years," he continued.</p>
