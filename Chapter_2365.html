<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not far away, Nelly had finally gotten herself up from the ground.</p>

  <p>From where she now stood, she watched the scene, and felt a dilemma arise within her.</p>

  <p>Of everyone, she knew Rachelle best. Once that girl had made up her mind on something, nothing and no one was going to convince her to change it.</p>

  <p>In the past, Nelly had never dared try persuading Rachelle.</p>

  <p>But in this present moment, a sudden burst of courage washed over her out of nowhere. She rushed forward at once. Now, she was standing right in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, please..." Nelly began. "Stop!" She begged her sister, gritting her teeth.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, Walton and Shahn were on the verge of attacking, when unexpectedly, Nelly had shown up.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for them to understand right away why Nelly, who had stopped Rachelle once before, was standing in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is Nelly doing? Is she absolutely crazy?" Walton chuckled nervously, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>Without saying anything, Shahn looked at Rachelle who was a little off to his left. Seeing as Nelly was Rachelle's younger sister, he was incredibly curious to find out how Rachelle was going to deal with her in this situation.</p>

  <p>"Nelly! What's wrong? What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle shouted angrily, raising her eyebrows as her face flushed.</p>

  <p>In front of her, Nelly stood her ground. She had always been compliant and obedient, and had never gone against her sister's will before.</p>

  <p>Yet, this was the second time and Rachelle had to do something!</p>

  <p>"I... I..." With a nervous look on her face, Nelly thought for a brief moment before she said tremblingly, "I think we need to have a serious conversation."</p>

  <p>"Have a serious conversation?" Rachelle was stunned. Her eyes narrowed and her brows furrowed together this time. "Are you kidding me?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Now, isn't that funny!" A big, goofy smile appeared on Walton's face as he laughed. Rachelle spun around and glared at him with fierce eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched Nelly's slender back, his expression full of surprise and disbelief.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that this girl would stand up for him time and time again. Especially now, before her sister!</p>

  <p>Nelly gritted her teeth and said, "Even if he's really a member of the Luo Clan and Mike's son, that doesn't automatically mean that he's our clan's enemy. Why do you have to kill him so badly?"</p>

  <p>As Rachelle heard what Nelly had said, her frown tightened. She glared at Nelly as if she was staring at a stranger. Her eyes were careless, emotionless. After a short while, she displayed a helpless smile and said,</p>

  <p>"When did you become so naive, Nelly?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not naive," replied Nelly, shaking her head. Then, she added decisively, "I just think we should all give each other another chance."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha." Rachelle was really pissed off and laughed sarcastically. If Nelly hadn't been her sister, she would have cut her into pieces with her short sword long ago. She sneered, "I'm giving you one single chance.</p>

  <p>Ask that guy over there if he agrees?"</p>

  <p>Nelly immediately turned to look at Luo Zheng, a pleading look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is impossible," Luo Zheng replied decisively and agilely, keeping his calm.</p>

  <p>The feud between the Luo Clan and the Mu Clan simply couldn't be resolved. Moreover, Luo Zheng wouldn't have the chance to negotiate with the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>A flicker of disappointment briskly flashed in Nelly's eyes.</p>

  <p>In fact, with her intelligence, Nelly had long known that Rachelle would react negatively. She also knew that the hatred between the Mu Clan and the Luo Clan wasn't going to be easy to resolve. The conflict involved disputes among the Hall of Holy Beings, and there had been a greater hatred hiding somewhere in the depths.</p>

  <p>From deep down inside her, she just couldn't help but have a burning desire to give it a try.</p>

  <p>The smirk on Rachelle's face grew colder and colder. Her eyes moved from Nelly and over to Luo Zheng. "What an interesting person you are! And tell me, what have you done to Nelly? She's never been so naive!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm... Nelly might have fallen in love with this guy," Walton suggested in a teasing, childish tone.</p>

  <p>As he spoke these words, Rachelle frowned once more, all while Nelly looked like a little kid whose secret had just been discovered and revealed. Her expression displayed a hint of panic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Nelly's jet black hair and his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>He suddenly heaved a long sigh and said, "It's such an honor for you three consummate True Gods to surround me, but you seem to have picked the wrong place." As he spoke, Luo Zheng slowly lifted his arm and gently placed his thumb on the silver ring worn by his middle finger.</p>

  <p>As he did this, he equally pointed toward the temple in the distance. A speck of silver light could be seen escaping it, and the sight of it was extremely dazzling.</p>

  <p>Just a few short moments ago, Luo Zheng had also overheard the conversation between Rachelle and Walton.</p>

  <p>The reason why Walton and Shahn had joined the battle was because they were afraid the fight between Luo Zheng and Rachelle would ultimately alert the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>"Do you really still want to fight?" Luo Zheng asked casually.</p>

  <p>When they noticed the ring on Luo Zheng's finger, their faces changed swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Space-striking Ring? Where did you get that?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle's face grew darker, and an intense premonition arose again. She was clearly very upset.</p>

  <p>When she had been stopped by Troy in the valley, she had felt that Luo Zheng was very lucky. Now though, it seemed that her hunch was right.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Rachelle! Is it really that important for you to kill this guy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Absolutely! This guy escaped from the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Will he be capable of escaping from those Holy Emperors, too?"</p>

  <p>"If you two really must fight, then get out of here! Just don't disturb that snake!"</p>

  <p>At the sight of the silver sword-shaped ring in Luo Zheng's hand, the rest of the consummate True Gods couldn't stop themselves from reminding Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Naturally, these consummate True Gods had recognized the two Space-striking Rings and were very well-aware of their power.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was really going to activate one of the Space-striking Rings and shoot toward the temple, who knew when they would be able to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple again.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's chest rose and fell as she breathed heavily. She stared at Luo Zheng like a venomous snake, the blade of her short sword trembling slightly in her hand.</p>

  <p>Despite all that, she still had a strong desire to work with Walton and Shahn in taking a risk in order to finally end Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a person, she never let herself be intimidated or threatened by anyone.</p>

  <p>That was when Shahn held out his hand and tried pressing down her short sword.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?..." As Rachelle spoke, Shahn shushed her with his index finger pressed on his lips and pointed in the temple's direction.</p>

  <p>At the moment, two spots of light flashed down from the depths of the Heavenly Wheel Temple, and then a huge monster began slowly crawling its way out.</p>

  <p>The monster was a huge black snake, and the scales on its body reflected a colorful glow. It was the Heavenly Wheel Snake that they had been waiting for this whole time.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Heavenly Wheel Snake appeared, silence immediately fell over the front of the altar.</p>

  <p>Everyone became stiff with fear. No one dared even breathe.</p>

  <p>The birds had been chirping, but right now, they had all fallen silent. Not a single sound could be heard.</p>

  <p>The crying children were also frightened. Many of them opened their mouths and stared at the huge black snake in a daze.</p>

  <p>The members of the Eagle race, Roc race, and Swallow race all knelt down, facing toward the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>How was it possible that the consummate True Gods present could be willing to show their respect to such a snake?</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that they were unable to use the Divine Dao in here, they would have already charged into the Heavenly Wheel Temple and chopped the snack to bits.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God was also a God!</p>

  <p>In their inner world, they were the ones to be bowed down before. There wasn't any reason for them to kneel before others.</p>

  <p>"That's it!"</p>

  <p>One of the members of the Roc race reminded Rachelle and the other consummate True Gods, despite trying to keep his voice low.</p>

  <p>The members of the Swallow race and the Eagle race also hinted at the other consummate True Gods and Luo Zheng. All of them had an expression of panic on their faces, fearing that this group of outsiders would infuriate the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>After hesitating for as long as they could allow, the consummate True Gods bent their knees, too.</p>

  <p>This world was the Heavenly Wheel Snake's home. In order to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple, they had no choice but to debase themselves.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also knelt down on one knee, slightly raised his head and carefully looked at the slowly wiggling Heavenly Wheel Snake. It was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Indeed, like the members of the Eagle race had said, the Heavenly Wheel Snake was very vigilant. It carefully extended its huge body from the temple and looked up and down, as if it would retract into the temple if it caught a glimpse of any sign of movement.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was observing the Heavenly Wheel Snake, he suddenly felt someone looking at him. He turned his head slightly and his eyes met directly with Nelly's.</p>

  <p>Nelly looked at Luo Zheng with a complex expression. She seemed to be trying to send a message through her bright eyes. Her expression was confused, but firm.</p>
