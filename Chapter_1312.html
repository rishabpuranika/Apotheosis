<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1312 The Return Of Yolande's Clones </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>A crease appeared between Zheng's brows at the thought of the second possibility: Yan was not in the universe.</p>

  <p>If that was true, then it would be a piece of bad news for him.</p>

  <p>The universe was too vast, and infinite even. How would Zheng even begin to find his sister?</p>

  <p>If Yan was outside the universe, that would even be harder for him!</p>

  <p>There was a trace of unwillingness on Zheng's face when he thought about those possibilities. He stretched his hand, and then activated the Roaring Token once more.</p>

  <p>"Yan Luo, where are you?"</p>

  <p>For the second time, Zheng's booming voice reverberated throughout the entire universe as the Roaring Token gently vibrated.</p>

  <p>All the numerous races and living beings of the universe heard the familiar call of Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. Who the hell is Yan Luo? Why is she so lucky? In order to find her, the man has used two Roaring Tokens without even batting an eyelid."</p>

  <p>"He's rather wilful, I must say."</p>

  <p>"But the way he shouted was confusing. Even if he's looking for someone, he shouldn't shout like that, right? He should've at least told where he is. Who looks for someone like that?"</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Zheng didn't have a powerful backer, nor was he a descendant of a Supreme Lord. Thus, he had to be careful due to his current strength and status. He couldn't tell anyone his name or location. If he revealed too much information, others would come after him.</p>

  <p>After his second shout had been transmitted, he waited again for five minutes, but there was still no response.</p>

  <p>The seconds passed by idly, and Zheng felt himself starting to get impatient.</p>

  <p>He had originally planned to use the Roaring Token to find his sister.</p>

  <p>After that, he would try to obtain enough life vitality jades and become an independent warrior. Finally, he would find a way to travel to the supreme worlds and see Yan.</p>

  <p>Alas, he couldn't even finish the first step of his plan because Yan did not respond.</p>

  <p>In extreme dissatisfaction, Zheng begrudgingly activated the Roaring Token again. And like what he did before, he shouted, "Yan Luo, where are you?"</p>

  <p>Just as his last word slipped out of his lips, a voice resounded in his ears.</p>

  <p>Someone responded to the call from his Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, so what if you've mastered the Energy Returning Incarnation?</p>

  <p>I'll wait for you in the Autumn Mountain World. Will you dare to come?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was already filled with anticipation when he heard the voice, but it turned out that it was from Supreme Lord Amritpal. An already agitated and impatient Zheng became even more furious.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that his voice wouldn't reach Yan's ears. When someone had interrupted him, he became more ablaze with anger.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't bother to provoke Supreme Lord Amritpal. But just as Supreme Lord Amritpal had finished speaking, another voice chimed in. "Just you wait. Wait for me to come and take your life!" Supreme Lord Myles shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng's ears reddened with irritation. Now, two Supreme Lords were quarrelling with the Roaring Tokens in his ears and it instantly infuriated him. Therefore, he impulsively activated the Roaring Token again.</p>

  <p>"What are you guys arguing about? Can't you just shut up?"</p>

  <p>Truly, Zheng had run out of his gentle patience and had finally snapped.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned in silence, for all the living beings in the universe were surprised to hear what he had just said.</p>

  <p>The Mist World.</p>

  <p>In the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>A glittery, milky white stream of light illuminated the countless ascending passageways, making them look like magical wisps.</p>

  <p>However, they weren't meant for martial artists from the Lower World who wanted to ascend into the Upper World. These ascending passageways were made by a mysterious woman from the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>She sat in a crystal bathing pool in the middle of the Mist Palace, her body bare and nude. She was enveloped in a layer of clouds, which made her beautiful figure and jade-like skin just vaguely visible to the naked eye. But her immense beauty was matched by her horrible back, which was covered in countless wounds.</p>

  <p>Not too long after, a silvery white light flashed from a nearby ascending passageway, followed by a woman who walked out from within it. She surprisingly looked exactly like the woman from the Mist Palace. There was nothing different at all between their appearances, expressions, and demeanor.</p>

  <p>The clothes from her body fell to the ground as she walked and stepped naked into the palace. As soon as she set foot inside, she instantly turned into a red light, and then she was absorbed by the woman in the bathing pool.</p>

  <p>After that, more and more women came out of the ascending passageways, and they were all absorbed by the woman in the bathing pool. Soon enough, the palace floor was littered with all sorts of clothes.</p>

  <p>The woman in the bathing pool was none other than Yolande, who Zheng had known in the Lower World before.</p>

  <p>But she wasn't actually the Yolande Zheng knew. To be exact, Zheng had met two of her clones.</p>

  <p>Yolande had cultivated a technique to divide her own soul into one million pieces, and then scattered them around the Lower World for cultivation. This renowned method was the Technique of One Million Clones.</p>

  <p>Since then, she had been constantly cultivating with her clones. This had greatly increased her cultivation base, experience, and comprehension.</p>

  <p>The reason was that she wanted to break through to the world lord level.</p>

  <p>Right now, her clones had already reached the end of their service and were being absorbed back through the ascending passageways.</p>

  <p>However, the entire absorption process wasn't fast and easy. It would take about a month or so. After all, there were many great worlds, and her clones ascended at varying speeds. What was more, not all of the clones had survived. Quite a small number of them got killed by the others, and some of them got imprisoned. She couldn't control all of them, so some accidents couldn't be helped.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was impossible for her to go down to the Lower World to seek revenge for them--she wasn't that bored anyway.</p>

  <p>In addition, she also needed to extract the clones' memories.</p>

  <p>Many of their memories were completely meaningless to her. However, she was surprised to find a man named  Zheng Luo in the memories from two of her clones.</p>

  <p>After she noticed the two clones' memories, she quickly extracted all the parts related to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This man is extremely special. He can lead the world of chaos, but at the same time, he's a man without destiny. It is impossible for one to have these two qualities because they are in complete contradiction, but surprisingly, he has both of them."</p>

  <p>The water stirred as Yolande soaked in the emerald green bathing pool.</p>

  <p>She tied her hair into a bun and raised her head, and then quietly fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>At that moment, she heard Zheng shout through the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>"Yan Luo, where are you?"</p>

  <p>Her face quickly twisted in confusion as she heard his voice.</p>

  <p>She had just extracted the memories about Zheng from her two clones.</p>

  <p>One of the memories was about the time when Zheng had been a nature creature, and the other was about when he had broken through to the Internal Elixir Realm in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Yolande knew that the voice was from Zheng the moment she heard it.</p>

  <p>"He is fast," Yolande muttered with a faint smile. "But where did he get that Roaring Token?"</p>

  <p>There were only five Roaring Tokens in her possession.</p>

  <p>Since she was almost a world lord, she didn't have many Roaring Tokens. Ordinary lords of supreme worlds usually had one or two. Given her special position, she had five.</p>

  <p>Five Roaring Tokens were already very rare to begin with. She wouldn't have used them, unless for an especially urgent matter.</p>

  <p>But in just this short amount of time, she had heard Zheng shout thrice already.</p>

  <p>"What a waste it is to find his sister with the help of Roaring Tokens."</p>

  <p>Yolande was at a loss for words. She had found out through her clone in White Emperor City that Zheng had a sister named Yan Luo, who seemed to be related to a grade two sect in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Later on, she was kidnapped and brought to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande had no idea how she came to the Upper World, since she didn't find any clues from her clones' memories.</p>

  <p>She just simply dispersed her clones like seeds, so she wouldn't control wherever they went. Furthermore, it really was impossible for her to control a million clones.</p>

  <p>Next, she heard the two Supreme Lords who used the Roaring Tokens to curse and argue against each other.</p>

  <p>It was known that Amritpal and Myles had long been enemies. Their cursing had lasted for many years, and it was unknown just how many Roaring Tokens they had wasted.</p>

  <p>They were Supreme Lords, so they had many Roaring Tokens and they were free to use them in any way they pleased. Now, Zheng, on the other hand, was not. How could he be so wasteful?</p>

  <p>Yolande scanned her surroundings. There were no signs of the ascending passageways opening up again. She assumed that her clones were still in flight, so she soaked her entire body in the bathing pool. The absorption process had made her weak and exhausted, so she had to immerse herself completely in the special liquid.</p>

  <p>The moment half her head was soaked in, she heard Zheng's angry curse.</p>

  <p>She coughed and exhaled repeatedly. She was so taken aback by Zheng that she had swallowed a bit of the liquid, which made her cough more violently.</p>
