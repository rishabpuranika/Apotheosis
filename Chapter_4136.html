  <p>Since the birth of the Source World as the primitive land, it had been quietly floating and never moved away.</p>

  <p>Under the Evil God's control, the moving speed of the Source World became much faster than that of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others were dumbfounded as the Source World revealed a huge mouth.</p>

  <p>At this speed, the Li Shan mountain would quickly be devoured by the Source World again.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"The Li Shan mountain can't speed up!"</p>

  <p>"If it continues to move at this speed, it will definitely be swallowed up!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was anxious, their hearts racing at the events that unfolded before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was different from the divine land. The divine land was a large ship that Chiyou had planned for a long time before it set sail. He had accumulated a huge amount of divine crystals to drive the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the plan to separate the Li Shan mountain from the Source World was a spur of the moment. There was no fuel to drive the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood in the middle of the mouth. The billowing chaotic energy blew past him, but he remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape. What a waste that all your efforts will be in vain!" he declared with eyes full of excitement.</p>

  <p>His voice reverberated from the Source World and echoed throughout the empty chaos.</p>

  <p>As the Source World drew closer and closer to the Li Shan mountain, the Evil God's body suddenly trembled as his face was struck with confusion.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he felt something breaking into the consciousness of the Source World.</p>

  <p>The consciousness of the Source World had always been controllable. The Evil God entered it without any obstacle blocking his way.</p>

  <p>After continuously fusing with the consciousness of the Source World, the Evil God built a wall in the Land of Consciousness to prevent the entrance of external beings.</p>

  <p>Breaking into the consciousness of the Source World was difficult. The Evil God didn't think anyone else in the Source World could do it.</p>

  <p>He built the wall just in case, but now something unexpected had really arrived!</p>

  <p>Controlling the movement of the Source World consumed a lot of the Evil God's energy. If he wanted to resist external invasion, he could just give up chasing after the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Evil God tried to make a choice decisively.</p>

  <p>Although it was important to take down the Li Shan mountain and Luo Zheng, the Source World was the foundation of his strength.</p>

  <p>Once he was expelled from the Land of Consciousness in the Source World, he would lose everything.</p>

  <p>After weighing the pros and cons, the Evil God gave up chasing after the Li Shan mountain with no hesitation. He chose to focus on fighting against the invader.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others had already lost hope.</p>

  <p>If the Li Shan mountain was taken back by the Source World, they would completely be annihilated.</p>

  <p>Although the Monkey Spirit King was not afraid of the Evil God, the Evil God could avoid him and kill all the people in the mountain.</p>

  <p>As everyone fell into great despair, the Source World suddenly slowed down and gradually stopped. In return, the Li Shan mountain instantly drifted away from the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Why did the Source World stop?"</p>

  <p>"Did the Evil God give up?"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to let us go?"</p>

  <p>Everyone on the mountain was puzzled about what just happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess all returned to the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>They looked at the huge crack and were curious as to why it was leaving.</p>

  <p>"With the character of the Evil God, he would never give up at such a critical moment," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng agreed, "Unless he meets some kind of irresistible force that poses a huge threat to him."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tilted her head, concentrating harder. "The Evil God has snatched Usman's power. Usman worked for the Xuanyuan, the Element Spirit Civilization, and even the Snake Masters. I don't think they'll just sit around and do nothing."</p>

  <p>The others nodded as they all came to an understanding.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was most likely right.</p>

  <p>The Source World was the largest primitive land in the chaos upholding its status.</p>

  <p>It was not a big deal that the Evil God had devoured Usman and gained his power. But now that the Evil God was about to take complete control of the Source World, could the Element Spirit Civilization and the Snake Masters manage to stay still?</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Li Shan mountain had escaped from disaster and protectively floated into the depths of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stayed in the mountain for a long time before returning to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In the consciousness of the Source World, thousands of white snowballs floated in the air.</p>

  <p>The snowballs were soft and a little cold. These were the consciousness of the Source World.</p>

  <p>The consciousness of the Source World was illusory and motile. It was almost impossible to touch or even find it.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, some legends said that if the mortals in the provinces happened to see and make wishes to the snowballs, the Source World would help them grant their wishes.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, however, wasn't sure whether these legends were true or not.</p>

  <p>He had found the Land of Consciousness by using Usman's power.</p>

  <p>Only he was able to find it. The wall he built using the consciousness of the Source World was not solid and performed no function at all.</p>

  <p>A black snake writhed rapidly through the Land of Consciousness. He drilled into one of the white snowballs, tainting it dark from the inside out.</p>

  <p>The black snake then jerked to the next snowball.</p>

  <p>The moment just enough white snowballs turned black, this snake could also obtain the power of the Source World.</p>

  <p>But he soon met his opponent.</p>

  <p>At a distance, some red snowballs started to float, and one of them turned into the shape of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How did you get here?" the Evil God asked as he stared at the little black snake.</p>

  <p>He found that the black snake emitted a strange and powerful aura which was similar to that of the giant ape.</p>

  <p>This crushed him.</p>

  <p>He had once thought himself to be the strongest in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization was nothing compared to him.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race even had to obey everything he ordered and assured to meet all his demands.</p>

  <p>With the support of the Source World, the Evil God didn't expect highly of the two strongest forces on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But that giant ape suddenly appeared, causing him confusion.</p>

  <p>Where did the giant ape come from?</p>

  <p>Was there such a powerful creature in the chaos?</p>

  <p>The giant ape was the one who saved the Li Shan mountain while an equally strong little snake appeared in the Land of Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Doubts began to flood the Evil God as he realized his flawed understanding of this world.</p>

  <p>"The primitive land doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve to have a hand in it," the little black snake hissed.</p>

  <p>The Evil God laughed. "How do you say it isn't mine? Do you own it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, it's ours. We haven't made a move because it isn't time yet," the snake boasted. "You still have time to leave, just after you return all the contaminated consciousness," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Previously, when the Evil God absorbed Usman, it did not attract the Snake Masters' attention.</p>

  <p>Usman represented the negative will. He could not invade the Land of Consciousness and it had never happened before.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God had done it, so the Snake Masters didn't think twice of making a move.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God maximized the power of the Source World, his body also changed into its weakest. They seized the chance to take action at their obvious advantage.</p>

  <p>The little black snake had just contaminated seven snowballs. The Evil God had stayed here for a long time. Tens of thousands of red snowballs floated behind him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God sneered, "I guess it's too late for you to leave now."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The red snowballs swarmed towards the little black snake, like a snow storm that coalesced to blanket him.</p>
