<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's heading for the Myriad Pagoda Mountains in the north. What a great coincidence!" Zheng exclaimed. "I wonder what it is going to do there." Just now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told him that the human heroes' real bodies were trapped at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Thus, it was surprising and fortunate that the Treacherous Being had also taken this path.</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven sort of thought otherwise. "This may not be a mere coincidence," he said. "I don't think it chose this direction just on a whim. It may have a specific purpose to go there," he speculated.</p>

  <p>"A specific purpose? What would that be?" Zheng asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"To enter the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>The Jade Pure Realm was the core area among the Three Purities Stage, and also the most mysterious one.</p>

  <p>Like the Element Spirit Civilization, almost all civilizations also wanted to enter and explore what was inside the Jade Pure Realm. That being said, the human race was no exception.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. So you mean that the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm is in that direction?" Zheng was utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled bitterly. "Well, why do you think we're trapped in here in the first place?"</p>

  <p>It turned out that all of the thirty-nine human heroes were trapped on their way to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the Jade Pure Realm had been a tremendous secret for most of the civilizations.</p>

  <p>As the Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race into the Three Purities Stage, the search for the way to the Jade Pure Realm had always been their top priority.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the Supreme Pure Realm was located at the center of the Grand Pure Realm. So, the assumption was that the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm might be also lying at the center of the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Based on this conjecture, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had managed to find some clues and ultimately discovered an underground passage at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>"Until now, I'm still not a hundred percent sure that the underground passage really leads to the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a disgruntled tone. "But ever since we discovered that passage, the Element Spirit Civilization had launched an all-out attack on us. If that passage was useless, then why were they desperately hindering us?"</p>

  <p>At that time, the 77th chaotic era dominated by humans had been destroyed, and the 78th chaotic era had already begun.</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the human race began to rise rapidly on the Other Shore. For a very long time, they had been fiercely fighting against the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Nihility race had yet to come into being, and the human race was the only force that could stand up as near equals to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had regarded the human race as a thorn in its flesh and did all it could to restrain their development. However, it never solely focused on them. After all, the Element Spirit Civilization had more than one enemy. Several ruling civilizations had already appeared before the 77th chaos, and these ruling civilizations were also a threat to them.</p>

  <p>However, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven had finally led the human race to the underground passage that could possibly lead to the Jade Pure Realm, the Element Spirit Civilization snapped and didn't hold back anymore. They started attacking them with the determination of eradicating the entire race.</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit gathered almost all of their elite members, but the best that they could do was trap us within the passage," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with pride.</p>

  <p>"If they resorted to these kinds of actions, then they really must have been hiding something important. The passage might be leading to the Jade Pure Realm all along," Zheng affirmed.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's why I said that I'm still not a hundred percent sure. There are just too many secrets in the Three Purities Stage, and the Element Spirit Civilization came before everyone else, so they must have uncovered most of these secrets. They destroyed those without much value, hid the important ones, and tried to keep them to themselves. Anyway, whether it leads to the Jade Pure Realm or not, I'm sure that the Element Spirit Civilization wants to hide something from us, that's why they kept us from advancing in that underground passage." The Primeval Lord of Heaven's words carried the weight of his determination.</p>

  <p>While he was communicating with the Primeval Lord of Heaven through his mind, Zheng also looked around and examined his surroundings at the same time.</p>

  <p>He saw that the Myriad Pagoda Mountains covered a very large area.</p>

  <p>The mountains here were completely different from the other mountainous areas.</p>

  <p>At a glance, every mountain looked like a lofty pagoda.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was an amazing sight to behold that all of the mountains were almost of the same height and shape.</p>

  <p>As he passed through them, he felt as if he had entered a strange, immense forest formed by numerous lofty mountains.</p>

  <p>"I just had an idea. Although the Treacherous Being doesn't seem to possess much intelligence, it knows Sanskrit words. How about we try communicating with it?" Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had long established a capable team within Zheng's inner world. This team was well-trained and it would be easy for them to pronounce even the complicated Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>After getting out of the Whining Road, Zheng had been preoccupied with the constant troubles that he encountered in the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Pagoda Mountains looked much quieter and safer, so he deemed it to be a good chance to give it a try.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had also originally planned to do the same thing, but the situation didn't permit him.</p>

  <p>Thus, when Zheng suggested it, he quickly gathered the members of his team.</p>

  <p>They had practiced and made other preparations to be skilled in terms of cooperation and synchronization.</p>

  <p>Following the instructions of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, they began to pronounce the corresponding Sanskrit words. Their voices echoed in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Can you understand me?</p>

  <p>Who are you?</p>

  <p>Can you communicate with me?"</p>

  <p>As they pronounced the Sanskrit words together, their voices eventually formed a rhythmic song.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being had taken over Zheng's entire body, so it should be able to hear the song.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven waited expectantly for the Treacherous Being to respond.</p>

  <p>However, to their dismay, it only continued to control Zheng's body by running wildly, as if it didn't hear anything at all.</p>

  <p>Although the result wasn't totally unexpected, the two of them still felt a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>"We could still try a few more times," Zheng insisted.</p>

  <p>With that, the team in his inner world began chanting again and conveyed the messages through rhythmic songs over and over.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, they repeated the same set of questions multiple times.</p>

  <p>However, they still didn't get a single response from the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Well, we did what we could." Zheng finally gave up and sighed in disappointment.</p>

  <p>It was upsetting enough for him to have his body manipulated by another creature. But what made it worse was that the particular creature didn't have a shred of intelligence.</p>

  <p>As Zheng chose to give up, he noticed that the Treacherous Being suddenly controlled his body and turned left. It was the first time that the Treacherous Being changed directions after a long while.</p>

  <p>After entering the range of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, it headed north for quite a distance before finally changing directions.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's expression was more of confusion, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction was the opposite. He was surprised, but there was a huge trace of expectation on his face.</p>

  <p>Perceiving this, Zheng couldn't help but ask, "What's the matter?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction just made Zheng more confused.</p>

  <p>"Listen. The underground passage at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains is not easy to find. It took us nearly a third of the chaotic era just to figure out the way to open it. The direction to get to the passage is to go north for three thousand miles, go west for five thousand miles, and then overturn the largest mountain at sight!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained in detail.</p>

  <p>Since entering the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had paid special attention to the movements of Zheng's physical body because of his hunch.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the Treacherous Being had gone north for exactly three thousand miles before it finally turned west.</p>

  <p>At the back of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's mind, this didn't seem to be a coincidence anymore.</p>

  <p>"Then, perhaps, the Treacherous Being is actually heading for the underground passage that leads to the Jade Pure Realm!" Zheng exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>'If that's the case, things would definitely work out, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the underground passage and met the real selves of the human heroes, they might be able to figure out a way to resolve Zheng's current state.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's nothing we could do now but hope for the best," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Pagoda Mountains was indeed a peaceful area. They didn't encounter any obstacles as Zheng's body trod all the way to the west.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before a round pagoda-shaped mountain finally appeared on their view.</p>

  <p>The mountain was several times broader than the rest, and it was also much higher.</p>

  <p>After arriving at the bottom of the huge mountain, the Treacherous Being paused for a moment before it manipulated Zheng's body to climb up the cliff.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven witnessed this, their minds were both filled with anticipation.</p>
