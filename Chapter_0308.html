<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 308 Pseudo Fairy Weapon (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was certain that James was not simply turning his life vitality into a sword. Just now, when the weapons melted into his life vitality and formed a vortex, a hint of milky-white color could be seen. It was?</p>

  <p>Heavenly essence! Luo Luo Zheng gazed in the direction of the heavenly essence looming in the vortex, his eyebrows snapping together.</p>

  <p>Heavenly essence was not easy to obtain. When a weapon refiner was about to temper a weapon, he could come to realize a few earthly and heavenly rules, that then could be used to forge the weapons.</p>

  <p>The more superior a weapon was, the larger number of heavenly laws it contained.</p>

  <p>So far, he knew of many weapon refiners in the Burning Sky Empire who had a knack for deciphering the Heavenly Law, and refining mysterious and spiritual weapons with it.</p>

  <p>But there was only one person who had the ability to disintegrate a weapon and extract the heavenly essence from it? it was Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could get his hands on the heavenly essence using the black fire in his mind to melt a weapon.</p>

  <p>How could James create it so easily?</p>

  <p>The weapons he had thrown at Luo Luo Zheng were not real; they were virtual ones formed with the help of his life vitality. Did James obtain the heavenly essence by dissolving the virtual weapons made out of his life vitality?</p>

  <p>No, absolutely not. Impossible!</p>

  <p>If James really could work such wonders, the Mo Clan wouldn't have collapsed into a decline.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng assumed that the heavenly essence he was seeing was not the real deal. It was something James had summoned through his life vitality? an element of illusion. It was definitely not the same thing as the heavenly essence Luo Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Luo Zheng still marveled at the technique. Those qualified to enter the Illuminating Soul Realm must undoubtedly have extraordinary skills.</p>

  <p>Weapons were constantly sucked into the center of the vortex and smashed to pieces, releasing James' life vitality and the heavenly essence that gathered to form a sword in James' hand.</p>

  <p>In this process of cohesion, the level of the life vitality sword upgraded continuously.</p>

  <p>The low-level mysterious weapon morphed to medium-level, then to a high-level one...</p>

  <p>Low-level spiritual weapon turned to medium-level, then to a high-level spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>Buzzz?</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the sword dazzled with a brilliant, blue light. The crowd which stood there gawking instinctively closed their eyes when they saw it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng covered his eyes with his hands too. When he opened them to look at James, the long sword had already come into shape.</p>

  <p>Glimmers of light lit up the surface of the long, blue sword. A tremor of shock passed through him at the mere sight of it.</p>

  <p>"It is a fairy weapon!"</p>

  <p>James was indeed powerful!</p>

  <p>He could conjure a variety of different weapons, like knives, swords, hammers...</p>

  <p>They might not hold a lot of power, but they were large in number, and each of them held a trace of the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>James broke the weapons into pieces and absorbed the life vitality and the essence to form a fairy weapon. It was indeed spellbinding to watch it happen.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a difference between this contrived fairy weapon and a true one. One could use the real fairy weapon at any time.</p>

  <p>It could be used to defend oneself against the enemy and even be given to others.</p>

  <p>But the fairy weapon in James' hand could be only used by himself. If he stopped the supply of his life vitality at any given moment, the weapon would gradually disappear.</p>

  <p>This was a pseudo-fairy weapon, but its power was just about the same as that of a real one.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, as long as James was granted enough strength and life vitality, he had the potential to cultivate a legendary sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was only feasible in theory.</p>

  <p>Every time a magic weapon went up a level, the heavenly essence required to sustain itself increased exponentially.</p>

  <p>The long sword James held was only a low-level fairy weapon. It was likely he couldn't upgrade it to a medium-level one. No one had that kind of endless strength and power. Every time James summoned a weapon, he could only generate a tiny bit of the heavenly essence. Unfortunately, the life vitality within him was hardly enough to manifest a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew it was impossible for James to manifest a medium-level fairy weapon, not to mention a sacred one.</p>

  <p>However, even it was only a fairy weapon, the power it held was awe-inspiring.</p>

  <p>"Boy! You brought this on yourself. You've forced me to take this action, and I'm afraid today won't end so well for you. Every time I cultivate my Ruin Sword, it needs to drink blood. Today, it's your blood that will feed it!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, James wielded the sword. Lifting it above his head, he slashed down at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At his movement, the tip of the sword morphed into the shape of a crescent moon. It was the sword energy.</p>

  <p>Fwoosh?</p>

  <p>As soon as the sword energy materialized, it rushed at Luo Luo Zheng with formidable power.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Nina cried out anxiously. The moment she saw the sword energy, her heart had leaped into her mouth. She wondered why none of her clansmen had come yet, when she had already sent for them through the Immediate Messenger.</p>

  <p>The fairy weapon was a lot more powerful than the spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p id="top_6">Although the sword energy looked ordinary, it came at Luo Luo Zheng with fierce strength. If Luo Luo Zheng failed to avoid the attack, he would probably be hacked into two pieces.</p>

  <p>Nina placed her hand on her small jade box with hesitation. She was not sure if she should help Luo Luo Zheng in this fight.</p>

  <p>Wurth's eyebrows furrowed. James had no shame! How could he act like this under the gaze of so many others? James was a nature creature with extraordinary strength. It surprised Wurth that he used such a ruthless trick to charge at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His actions were no less shameless than an adult going all out to fight a child!</p>

  <p>Could Luo Luo Zheng get away this time?</p>
