<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>The dozens of Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and the consummate True Gods had joined forces to strike an attack. Even the powerful masters at the Other Shore Realm would have been shattered into tiny bits by this attack.</p>

  <p>However, the blue light ball was still floating in the air motionlessly and without any damage. The attacks had been absorbed and were then transformed into the red light ball.</p>

  <p>Red flames were formed and they roiled wildly with the red light ball like waves.</p>

  <p>If one would look closely, a faint figure would be seen. One could see that a body of a girl was inside the ball, and was also rolling madly.</p>

  <p>The red light ball had swollen up a little bit more.</p>

  <p>"That's not enough! Everyone... Please do your best!" the woman ordered, raising her eyebrows at the scene.</p>

  <p>The clones under her command were naturally obedient after hearing the order. They once again prepared for another attack.</p>

  <p>Clark's clone acted first as he patted slightly on his waist and a small bronze wine cup flew up. His hand then stretched to take a hold of the cup and drank down whatever was in it.</p>

  <p>As he emptied the contents of the cup, his face turned red and his aura had increased greatly.</p>

  <p>The real Clark was all along watching the actions on the side. He saw and noticed the moment his clone took out the wine cup.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his clone drank it without any hesitation, he couldn't help but shudder.</p>

  <p>It was the 'Forbidden Fire Blood' that he had secretly refined. Although it could enhance one's power in a short time, it would have a negative influence on one's soul. And now, he actually saw his clone drink it down without even hesitating.</p>

  <p>They were after all just clones. They cared about nothing and used different methods to enhance their strength at the woman's order.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the alliance of powerful clans also heard the woman's order and went all out. They gave their best in their strikes but not to cross a line.</p>

  <p>They surely wouldn't enhance their strength by the way of harming their bodies.</p>

  <p>"The second round of attack!"</p>

  <p>All sorts of skills were exerted to attack the surface of the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>A violent explosion resounded through the air.</p>

  <p>The flame in the red light ball began to swell and expanded once again!</p>

  <p>"Crack-"</p>

  <p>A thin crack had finally appeared on the surface of the red ball.</p>

  <p>Nicholas raised his eyebrows suddenly upon seeing the crack. Samuel's expression changed as a greedy light flashed across his eyes.</p>

  <p>Both of them were on their own schemes. They didn't care about what the woman had planned. As long as there was a chance, they would seize it immediately!</p>

  <p>The woman wasn't bothered by anything else as her focus was on the red light ball. A smile appeared on her face as soon as she saw the crack. Her estimation was right. With their joint efforts, they really made an opening on the light ball!</p>

  <p>"There is a crack! It's cracking! Go on!"</p>

  <p>The red light ball had already swelled to its limit and presumably the third round of attack would be enough to completely break it.</p>

  <p>However, just as everyone was preparing for the third round of attack...</p>

  <p>The raging flame inside the red light ball suddenly spread out towards both sides. A tender palm emerged and suddenly slapped on the surface of the light ball. At the same time, the girl's face was seen in the red flame. Her eyes were open staring through the light ball at the people outside.</p>

  <p>"The girl woke up?"</p>

  <p>"She has her own consciousness?"</p>

  <p>"This thing... How strong is it?"</p>

  <p>For the Holy Beings, they only considered the girl as a supreme treasure of belief. The scene had indeed surprised them as they didn't expect that she had gained her own consciousness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Sword Chen had heard the woman once mentioned that this girl had awakened, but her intelligence was only at a low level...</p>

  <p>The girl moved and clung close to the surface of the light ball, her fiery red eyes showing a trace of curiosity. She looked and transferred her gaze at one to another from time to time, seemingly innocent like a child of two or three years old. She appeared to be curious about everything, and on her lips plastered a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The third round of attack was not delayed as they continued to bombard the blue light ball again.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for several snaps to happen.</p>

  <p>This time, cracks had quickly appeared on the surface of the red ball.</p>

  <p>The red and blue light balls complemented each other. If one of them could not hold on, the other would also break!</p>

  <p>The energy inside the red light ball was already on the verge of overflowing, and the blue light ball was unable to transform the energy anymore. It could only rely on itself to resist the attacks of the Holy Beings, and cracks also appeared on its surface!</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped on their attacks as they heard the sound. The two balls already had cracks on their surfaces and they continued to spread.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we have succeeded..."</p>

  <p>"They are still cracking."</p>

  <p>"Should we... fight for the girl?"</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of powerful clans began to secretly examine the woman.</p>

  <p>They were a bit afraid of this woman, but they were already at the end of their journey. With the True Demon Body being so close to them, no one would easily give in.</p>

  <p>There might be a fierce battle in this place!</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The surface of the two light balls was full of cracks, and the fragments in the cracks began to fall slowly.</p>

  <p>Without the binding force of the light balls, the cold energy and the flame energy nakedly floated in the air...</p>

  <p>At this moment, no one dared to rush forward as they watched everything that was happening on full alert.</p>

  <p>The cold energy and the flame were so deadly...</p>

  <p>The True Demon Body could activate energy to the maximum. The red flame should be the most scorching flame in the divine land, and this time, its temperature had reached its limit. The cold energy also reached the limit of low temperature.</p>

  <p>Despite the pressure, everyone was ready to make a move!</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, the blue and white cold energy began to intersect with the red flame. And they neutralized!</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>A sharp sound was heard when the two forces converged.</p>

  <p>Soon, the fusion of cold energy and the flame appeared to get smaller in size.</p>

  <p>Two delicate figures floated quietly in the air. They were two identical girls.</p>

  <p>They looked exactly the same from their appearances, but their auras differed greatly. The girl on the left blinked her eyes and looked around with a joyful smile on her face.</p>

  <p>The girl on the right had a big pair of eyes, but there was no emotion in her blue eyes. If anyone met her eyes, it was as if they were looking at two lifeless cold pools. It would certainly make people feel chill in their spines.</p>

  <p>After the two streams of deadly energy disappeared, there was silence again in the void.</p>

  <p>The silence was soon disturbed as the girl on the left giggled. She looked at the crowd and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Hardly had her voice faded away, the woman had already rushed forward!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas sneered and followed her in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>They were soon followed by Clark and Murphy.</p>

  <p>Samuel looked tempted. The ability of the True Demon Body was so powerful that it was beyond imagination. For this opportunity, he naturally wouldn't let it go.</p>
