<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 955 Fight Back </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's eyes opened, the expressions of the three warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm changed. Elder Hu shouted, "Quick! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>All of the three knew that if they offended someone, it would be wise to eliminate that person. If they showed even the slightest bit of mercy, they would definitely face a lethal counterattack from the person.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there was no hesitation on their faces at all.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was about to face fierce attacks by the three warriors at the late stage of Internal Elixir Realm, he didn't move at all. He gently touched the space ring hanging on his chest. A long spear and spots of light appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Xun's tall and slender body instantly materialized and she cast a charming smile at the three warriors. She extended her hand to take the long spear. Her nimble wrist flicked the weapon lightly and it instantly lashed out.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The trio owned low-grade fairy weapons, which shattered immediately upon impacting with the spear.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the mid-grade sacred weapon, Elder Hu had a feeling this wouldn't end well.</p>

  <p>A low-grade sacred weapon was very valuable in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>There weren't many such weapons in the entire Central Region, but this woman even had a mid-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>And who the hell was this beautiful woman appearing out of nowhere? A sword spirit that had a real shape? It was hard for the three of them to fathom.</p>

  <p>They didn't think they could deal with her.</p>

  <p>The three warriors were already regretting their decision. But now that they had decided to kill Luo Luo Zheng for his treasures, there was no use crying over spilled milk. If they were going to take his life, then they ought to be prepared to be killed in the fight too.</p>

  <p>The trio had been through many trials and hardships together, so they had a tacit understanding among each other, especially in situations where the outcomes didn't look favorable. They quickly retreated in three different directions.</p>

  <p>But Xun didn't give them a chance to escape. The long spear in her hand shook lightly, and three invisible ripples of energy shot out.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm were only equal to level seven to level ten war generals on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these three warriors were from Fish Dragon Sect, a mere third-grade sect. They were far inferior to Olivia and Cheryl, who were both divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Blood pooled on the backs of all three warriors. They didn't even have a chance to fight back. They fell into the sea like kites whose strings had been cut. Their blood turned the water red.</p>

  <p>"Done!" Xun said to Luo Luo Zheng with a triumphant smile.</p>

  <p>She didn't know why, but after they had returned to the Central Region, she had felt joyful and relieved. As the queen of the Demon Night, she had a proud and aloof personality. She used to order everyone around as if they were all her subordinates.</p>

  <p>But now, when she did things for Luo Luo Zheng, she felt very happy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and said, "But those three girls are in trouble."</p>

  <p>"Who cares?" Xun rolled her eyes. The others were completely worthless in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly stood up. "Come on! It took them a lot of effort to get me out of the sea." The Space Law Power in his body had been almost removed by him. Only a small amount of it remained in his body, which had little effect on him now.</p>

  <p>He leaped off the reef and turned into a beam of light, shooting off somewhere.</p>

  <p>Bess and the other two girls were frightened to death. They had tried their best to flee from this place. The three of them had grown up under the protection of their parents and brothers. They were so innocent that they didn't know how evil some people could be. They couldn't understand why Elder Hu wanted to kill that man. They had just come here for the Black Cyan Clam. Why did Elder Hu send people to kill them? Was it just to prevent them from exposing their secret?</p>

  <p>There were a lot of things that they couldn't figure out, but they didn't have the time to think right now. Even innocent girls like them knew that they would be raped and killed if they were caught. The five people behind them cursed and tried their best to catch up to them.</p>

  <p>Why was the sea so vast? Why couldn't they bump into someone who could save them?</p>

  <p>"Aargh!" One of the girls suddenly screamed out. A small dart had struck her back. The dart glowed with a brilliant blue light; it was obvious that it was smeared with poison.</p>

  <p>The girl's body went limp and she fell towards the sea.</p>

  <p>However, a warrior stepped forward and caught her. "Ha-ha! Don't worry. You won't die just yet! This is only a sleeping drug. I won't kill you before I fuck you."</p>

  <p>At the same time, another girl screamed out too. She was struck down in the same way.</p>

  <p>Seeing the terrible scene, Bess suddenly felt dizzy. She couldn't stop and turn around to save her friends. Otherwise, she would also be caught and they would all die. If she could escape, she might still have the chance to avenge her friends.</p>

  <p>"I must escape!" she said through gritted teeth and tears. Bess, who was usually as docile as a sheep, suddenly looked aggressive.</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure appeared in front of her. A black scorpion was tattooed on his face, and he had an evil Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape," Barnard said menacingly. "Bess, why don't you play with us? I'm your sect-mate. Trust me, it'll be fun." A nasty smile hung on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! You don't deserve to be my sect-mate." Bess gritted her teeth and pulled out her weapon. It was a flying sword? a top-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Barnard smiled and said, "You're right. I am not your sect-mate. If it weren't for the situation in the Central Region, I would have never joined this fucking Fish Dragon Sect!"</p>

  <p>"If the sect leader and elders find out about this, you will surely die!</p>

  <p>Aren't you afraid?"</p>

  <p>Bess was both furious and frightened.</p>

  <p>Barnard shook his head and chuckled. "They don't know. If they did, we wouldn't have attacked you. It's a pity that they will never know."</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, they had wanted to silence the girls by killing them. Now Barnard spoke without the slightest fear of being exposed.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" she spat out. The flying sword in her hand suddenly shot out and went whirling towards the fiend.</p>

  <p>"Wow, you are indeed from a large clan. Your cultivation level is not so high, yet you have a top-grade fairy weapon. I really like this flying sword. I'll happily accept it!" A wicked smile appeared on his face. He was quick and easily avoided her flying sword.</p>

  <p>It was reasonable to say that Bess' cultivation level was on par with Barnard's. What was more, the cultivation method she practiced was much better than that of Barnard. Theoretically, if they were to fight, he would definitely not be a match for her.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Bess had never gotten a crisis like this before. She rarely had the chance to fight someone with her true strength, let alone experience a life-and-death battle.</p>

  <p>Barnard and his other four companions were pirates, so killing and looting people came easily to them. They had a lot of combat experience? something Bess could never match up. So when they came to blows, he was a tough opponent for her.</p>

  <p>Barnard stepped aside, dodging the flying sword easily. He then moved forward and stood behind Bess. He rested his chin on her shoulder and blew a breath of air into her ear to tease her. He said softly, "Your cultivation level and strength are not bad, but it's a pity that your combat experience is zero. If you continue to control the flying sword like this, you'll never be able to stab me."</p>

  <p>Bess was disgusted at his words. She struck him with her elbow. At the same time, she summoned the flying sword back to her. She thrust the flying sword backwards hoping to stab him.</p>

  <p>Once again Barnard seemed to have preempted her attack. He took a small step aside and easily dodged it. He still hung close to her back like a ghost. This time, he even put his hand on her slender waist and said,</p>

  <p>"Bess, I already told you that you wouldn't be able to hurt me."</p>

  <p>Bess' combat experience was weak, but her willpower was exceptionally strong. Now she was going all out.</p>

  <p>Barnard loved to torture his prey, especially if it was this kind of a stubborn woman. He was still sticking close to her back, like a cat playing with a mouse before killing it.</p>

  <p>But this time, Bess' flying sword did not miss. It stabbed a warrior who was standing not far away from her instead.</p>

  <p>The man was laughing obscenely and tearing another girl's clothes apart.</p>

  <p>He was so engrossed in his disgusting act that he didn't see or hear the flying sword.</p>

  <p>"Wray, be careful!" Barnard shouted. He did not expect Bess to suddenly attack someone else either. But his warning came too late. Bess' flying sword had already pierced through the man's chest.</p>
