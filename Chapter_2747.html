  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The strange fish moved its legs madly as it ran along the road between the two flaming mountains, completely disregarding the fact that there could be danger ahead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but shake his head when he saw this scene. They all continued to follow closely behind the fish.</p>

  <p>However, just after they had crossed a hundred miles, a sharp cry erupted from the peak of the mountains on both sides.</p>

  <p>Enormous birds with wings as wide as a thousand feet flew over the mountains, covering the sun and the rest of the sky.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was always dimly lit, but these giant birds had caused the mountain roads below to fall into almost pitch darkness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so fast!"</p>

  <p>The strange fish was still running excitedly without even noticing the giant birds above its head.</p>

  <p>But a few moments later, it came to a stop. At the end of the mountain road stood a fiend that was three thousand feet tall. The strange fish turned around and looked at Luo Zheng and the others with innocent eyes.</p>

  <p>'This stupid fish...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cursed the fish in his heart. If it weren't for the fact that they needed the strange fish to guide the way for them, he would have killed it.</p>

  <p>As the giant birds in the sky continued circling the mountains, seemingly having no intention of attacking, the fiend blocking the mountain path said,</p>

  <p>"Humans, you... are from the Reincarnation Land?"</p>

  <p>This gigantic fiend who was over a thousand feet high, had a ferocious face, and he was giving off a dreadful and gloomy aura.</p>

  <p>Compared to the four fiends that guarded the pasture, this fiend was much more powerful and superior in terms of strength and status.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the pasture was a dead end; there was no other entrance there. And these five humans seemed to have emerged out of nowhere. So, there was only one explanation? they had come here from the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, a similar event had occurred. A Holy Being had run away from the pasture, killed a lot of fiends, and finally managed to escape the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"So what?" Luo Zheng sneered arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Leland stared at the giant birds above them. There were also some tall figures behind these giant birds. It was obvious that some fiends were controlling these giant birds.</p>

  <p>"My name is Begaus and I'm the commander of the sixth stage," the fiend said, introducing himself. "Our fiend race isn't as cruel as you think. If you're willing to come with me, I'll spare your lives.."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was a consummate True God and Leland was a Demi-holy Being, Begaus didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>The fiends' army had already gathered in the sixth stage to attack the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>After receiving the news from the guard of the pasture, Begaus had rushed over with a group of fiends. But now, as he looked at these humans, he was confident that he wouldn't even need the strong team that he had behind him; he could kill them all by himself.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods behind Luo Zheng were frightened to death after seeing the grand scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>Even with Luo Zheng and Leland around, all their hope for survival dissipated. If they could really escape death as long as they surrendered, they would be more than willing to do it.</p>

  <p>"I believe that it's very easy for you to make a choice," Begaus said, smiling at Luo Zheng with a trace of sincerity on his ferocious face. As long as the humans were willing to obediently serve the fiends, they were all very welcome to stay.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up at the mountain-like fiend in front of him and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"You also have two choices."</p>

  <p>"What?" Begaus was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Go away, or die," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>At once, rage appeared on Begaus's face. "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>He pulled out a bone whip that was five thousand feet long and flicked it toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The bone whip looked like a huge dragon as it unfurled along the mountain road.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>With a fearful shriek, the strange fish swayed its long slender legs and fled to the side.</p>

  <p>However, when the end of the bone whip smashed on the ground, the strong gust of wind from the impact flung the fish away, causing it to crash into the mountain.</p>

  <p>Swaying dizzily, the strange fish turned around and saw Luo Zheng pressed under the huge bone whip. It couldn't help but sigh in disappointment. "Is it over?</p>

  <p>Alas... "</p>

  <p>Begaus was holding the whip in his hand, his eyes filled with pride. His whip was extremely powerful. Just one lash was enough to smash a human consummate True God into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, before he could let out a triumphant laugh, he saw a movement at the end of his whip.</p>

  <p>"Not dead? You still want to get up?" Begaus' eyes widened slightly in surprise, and he decided to wave the bone whip again.</p>

  <p>But he had barely raised his arm when he felt a huge force coming from the bone whip.</p>

  <p>Swish...</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the bone whip slipped out of his hand unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>With just one forceful tug at the end of the bone whip, Luo Zheng managed to pull it away from Begaus.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly raised the bone whip and, at the same time, shouted, "Move aside, Leland!"</p>

  <p>The moment Begaus had struck Luo Zheng with his whip, Leland had reacted.</p>

  <p>His skin had become colorful and he had soared into the air, killing the giant birds and the fiends controlling them.</p>

  <p>The strength of these giant birds and these fiends was similar to that of ordinary consummate True Gods. However, since there were so many of them, Leland was having a hard time dealing with them.</p>

  <p>When he heard Luo Zheng's warning, he turned over and let himself fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the huge bone whip arced across the air at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a sharp whistling sound, it smashed into the remaining birds.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Crisp sounds indicated the shattering of bones of both the giant birds and the fiends on their backs. The feathers of the birds fell down slowly like snowflakes.</p>

  <p>Begaus' face darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>Until now, his attention had been fully focused on the Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>That was why he had decided to finish the consummate True God first. As for the several top-rank True Gods, he knew that they posed no threat.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that his calculations had been wrong. The strength of the consummate True God was far beyond anything he had witnessed from a human! This man posed a much greater threat than the Demi-holy Being who was with him.</p>

  <p>At this rate, Begaus knew that all his warriors would be killed by this mysterious human in just a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>Wisps of faint red light flickered on the rough skin on Begaus' body.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang...</p>

  <p>He was so large that he rushed over to the humans with just a few menacing steps.</p>

  <p>Leland knew that as the Demi-holy Being in the group, he should be the one to stop Begaus. However, Begaus' strong aura and his mountain-like figure were so overwhelming that Leland hesitated. In the end, he said, "Luo Zheng, be careful!"</p>

  <p>"I'll pulverize you!" Begaus growled, reaching Luo Zheng in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Gathering thousands of pounds of force at his foot, he brought it down toward Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The fiends in the Abyss Demon Region were good at using raw power to solve everything. Since it was impossible for everyone to use Grand Teleportation, their huge size had become a natural advantage.</p>

  <p>Seeing the huge foot coming down at him, Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and sneered. "You? Pulverize me?"</p>

  <p>Then, he spat out a simple word:</p>

  <p>"Grow!"</p>

  <p>Before Begaus' foot could touch him, he had grown to a height of four thousand feet.</p>

  <p>His physical form had surpassed Begaus' in an instant, and it was still continuing to grow rapidly.</p>
