<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1993 A Cold-blooded Woman (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, Yao didn't have the slightest bit of mercy or care for her own people. She had slaughtered her way through the ogres' supreme world, but at the cost of countless lives of Demon Night warriors. The lives of her own people were sacrificed to pave the way for her desires.</p>

  <p>Yao's actions made the Demon Night warriors feel a chill in their spines. They were confused as to what the purpose of her actions was.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my sight already!" When she saw that the three generals were still on their knees, Yao's face flashed with a trace of viciousness.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were filled with disgust as she looked at the three warriors still in front of her.</p>

  <p>However, the three generals remained unmoved. Their faces were filled with despair as they stared at Yao. Sorrowful eyes revealed their hopelessness.</p>

  <p>"How dare you disobey me! What the hell do you want?" A cold smile suddenly appeared on Yao's face. An invisible pressure spread out, which caused the surrounding space to faintly crackle with lightning bolts.</p>

  <p>The harsh methods of the Queen of Punishment were well-known, but the three generals were already committed. They planned to stake their lives for the good of their people.</p>

  <p>After they witnessed their companions get killed one by one and suffered from such an unexpected disaster, the generals were heartbroken. That was worse than their own deaths. To persuade their queen, they would rather accept Yao's punishment.</p>

  <p>"My queen! Please consider our pleas! I hope that we can temporarily retreat! It is for the good of our people," a general continued to beg.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>One after another, electric snakes appeared on the general's body. The snakes wrung around almost uncontrollably. Being devoured by the lighting, the general suddenly rolled away in pain. After just a few seconds, the general hung motionlessly at the side of the tree trunk as she trembled from head to toe. A burnt smell emanated from her body.</p>

  <p>Yao's expression was cold as her gaze shifted to the other two. The two grand world lords were still as brave as before. Even after they saw the miserable state their companion was in, they didn't waver in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Their commitment to change her mind was enough to lay down their lives.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" After she saw such committed expressions from the other generals, Yao let out a deep sigh. "In two days, Ying's team should be able to reach the Bloody Evil World. We'll be able to break through this pass. I believe that the way before us will be unobstructed!"</p>

  <p>"The way before us? What do you mean, my queen? Should we go ahead and fight the Celestial Position race? And how about the Thoughtless Minds? Are they going to be our enemies too?" one of the two generals asked politely.</p>

  <p>In actuality, the strongest team of the Demon Night race should be the team of the Queen of Killings, namely the Saint Spear Sect. The group was led by Xun, and they were the strongest sword of the Demon Night race. However, after Xun disappeared, the members of the Saint Spear Sect were killed or prisoned.</p>

  <p>With the current strength of the Demon Night race, it would be tough for them to face anyone of the strong forces of the humankind. Additionally, the three forces of the humankind and the Celestial Position race had long been tightly allied with each other. The Demon Night race would only rush their death if they dared to mess with them.</p>

  <p>"The Sacred race won't just stand by and watch. In the end, the final victory belongs to us," Yao replied in a confident voice.</p>

  <p>"Does such a victory mean anything to us? Would it be really worth the sacrifices we've made?" The general gritted her teeth after she spoke.</p>

  <p>Regret was reflected in her tone.</p>

  <p>Yao was slightly stunned. She paused for a while before she looked at the general again.</p>

  <p>'She is right.</p>

  <p>To the Demon Night race, such a victory would be meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, for the Sacred race, for the person who planted the Soul-sealing Needle and created the Demon Night race, this matter would be of great significance!</p>

  <p>This is my mission!' Yao thought. She grew even more devout to accomplish her goals.</p>

  <p>As a result, she did not have the slightest bit of mercy for the deaths of her clansmen. She dismissed such casualties as necessary sacrifices.</p>

  <p>"You don't need any meaning," Yao replied coldly. Her eyes remained cold.</p>

  <p>"My queen, you only need us to send ourselves to our deaths? You want us to fall on our swords for a victory without any importance?" the general asked in a worried voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Yao replied coldly. An expressionless face showed how little she cared for her people.</p>

  <p>"You're crazy!" the general suddenly scolded in rage.</p>

  <p>There had never been anyone from the Demon Night race who dared to speak to their queens like that. Even if some of their sinful fellow members of the Demon Night race had betrayed them, they would still not be dissatisfied with their queens. The queens of the Demon Night race were supposed to be absolute.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, the general reprimanded the Queen of Punishment right in front of her face. That was something that had never happened before in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! Imbecile!"</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed in Yao's eyes. The general was struck by lightning and immediately tumbled down the tree. Smoke appeared from the general's body as a burnt smell filled the air.</p>

  <p>Only one general was left in front of Yao.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to reprimand me too? Who do you think you are?" Yao stared at her and asked in a scary tone.</p>

  <p>The general was about to speak when something happened.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a vicious, murderous intent was suddenly emitted from the Purple Feather Trees.</p>

  <p>Like the palaces of the Demon Night race, there were queens' statues in every Purple Feather Tree. At this moment, the statue of the Queen of Killings emitted an intense red light. It was followed by an old and familiar voice.</p>

  <p>"I am Supreme Lord Leroy, a representative of the Queen of Killings. I am here to issue a queen's order!"</p>
