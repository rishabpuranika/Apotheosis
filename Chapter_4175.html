<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A great distance stood between them and the giant clam, making it difficult for them to tell its actual size.</p>

  <p>However, as the giant clam approached them, it began to grow bigger and bigger. The astonishment in the eyes of the Holy Beings, and the warriors at the Other Shore Realm intensified.</p>

  <p>The divine land was massive enough. The Ruin Graveyard was already several times larger than the divine land, but this giant clam was several times larger than the Ruin Graveyard!</p>

  <p>The giant clam headed straight for the Ruin Graveyard without pausing or changing direction.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the heads, which were growing like crazy, and then back at the giant clam, which was approaching them at a rapid pace. Their hearts began to sink.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard would be doomed.</p>

  <p>When the huge clam was just hundreds of thousands of miles away from the Ruin Graveyard, its serrated crack had already opened.</p>

  <p>Then, it slowed down. It did in the same way a giant would slow down to crouch down and feed itself food.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop fighting. It's useless to struggle," Holy Jay said helplessly.</p>

  <p>Even if they killed the heads, they still wouldn't be able to save the Ruin Graveyard. They were destined to be swallowed by the huge clam, and by the size of the clam's mouth, it could surely do it in one gulp!</p>

  <p>No matter how hard they tried, they would die eventually.</p>

  <p>Even Tianming, who had been bravely fighting day and night without taking any breaks, drew back his Lone Sword. After distancing himself from the heads, he stood looking up at the sky. Despite the situation, he almost looked calm, but none of them could tell how he was actually feeling.</p>

  <p>Above the divine land stood another group of people who were watching them. Most of them were Consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>One of them was Rachelle who had previously died but was revived because of Nelly's pleading. She had become a Consummate True God again and had been wholeheartedly comprehending the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>With her talent, it wouldn't be long before she mastered the Truth of Godly Way, allowing her to ring the bell and reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>However, before she could finish cultivating the Truth of Godly Way, bad news struck. The bell had been broken.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle learned this, she fell into a depression. She didn't expect to meet such a great disappointment. Now, the Ruin Graveyard was about to get destroyed, and there was nothing she could do to escape the divine land. She hit a dead end, and she didn't know how to get out of it.</p>

  <p>Not far in front of Rachelle, there was a warrior in the sixth stage of the Other Shore Realm standing with his hands behind his back. This was Mike's disciple? Harold.</p>

  <p>Like Rachelle, Harold had been waiting to enter the seventh stage of the Other Shore Realm for a long time. To prepare, he had put himself into seclusion.</p>

  <p>When he received the news, he became as depressed as Rachelle. He was already about to ring the bell after breaking through, only to find out that the bell was broken.</p>

  <p>Because he was so busy mourning over this, he didn't even expect that in just a few days, he would find something new to mourn over? the Ruin Graveyard's doom!</p>

  <p>To them, it seemed that no one could escape the tragedy that was about to come.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the heads continued to bite, a tombstone, which was even larger than the divine land, cracked.</p>

  <p>When it collapsed, it made an earth-shattering sound and buried countless creatures under it.</p>

  <p>However, the powerful warriors in the Ruin Graveyard didn't care about such a noise. They didn't even bother to look at it.</p>

  <p>The giant clam was already very close to them now, its mouth hung open.</p>

  <p>After a few more seconds, it reached the Ruin Graveyard, swallowing it whole.</p>

  <p>"Such long, big teeth!" Augustus said, his eyes wide open in a mixture of fear and amazement.</p>

  <p>"They seem to be some kind of plant," Hallet said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder of nature. It really is amazing." Augustus said, trailing off.</p>

  <p>"Well, when these sharp teeth close and grind you into tiny pieces, you won't be able to call it amazing anymore," Hallet said in annoyance.</p>

  <p>If the giant clam closed its mouth, it would be able to grind the entire Ruin Graveyard, the tombstones, the divine land, and even the heads into fine-grained powders.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone's heart was clenched. Augustus began talking again, unbothered. "Well, it hasn't closed its mouth yet. Is it going to stop?"</p>

  <p>Hallet refused to reply, not wanting to speak to him anymore. Augustus had always been so optimistic, but this time, his optimism was out-of-place.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard was already heading deep into the giant clam. Oddly enough, its teeth still hadn't chomped them to death.</p>

  <p>Why wasn't the giant clam closing its mouth?</p>

  <p>This was the question they all asked themselves.</p>

  <p>Was the giant clam planning on using a different method to destroy the Ruin Graveyard?</p>

  <p>Or will it let go of the Ruin Graveyard?</p>

  <p>A hint of hope, although unrealistic, began to form in their hearts.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Ruin Graveyard passed the giant clam's teeth, but for some reason, it still hadn't attacked.</p>

  <p>Not long after this, they saw a mountain floating in the distance, and it was unimaginably huge.</p>

  <p>"Why is there a huge mountain flying over there?"</p>

  <p>"I thought the tombstones in the Ruin Graveyard were large, but they're nothing compared to that!"</p>

  <p>"What mountain is that?"</p>

  <p>The people in the Ruin Graveyard looked up at the big, flying landform.</p>

  <p>At first, when they saw the mountain, they felt a sense of awe, but after staring at it for a few more minutes, they began to feel suffocated.</p>

  <p>After a while, Lorena and Rosie appeared at the top of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Harold greeted and bowed to Lorena.</p>

  <p>Lorena waved her hand and took two steps forward, her eyes in thought yet clouded with confusion. "It seems to be... the Pear Hill."</p>

  <p>"The Pear Hill? Lorena, are you sure?" Rosie said with a look of disbelief.</p>

  <p>The last time she heard about it, she was still so young. Although she knew what it was, she had never been there before.</p>

  <p>Lorena, on the other hand, had been to Pearl Hill before, even being able to climb it. When she had reached the mountain's peak, she looked down, trying to take in the whole of what she was standing on.</p>

  <p>However, the mountain was as big as a province! Even if someone stood on top of it, it would still difficult for them to see the entire mountain.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Chaos Ancient Gods had transformed the mountain, and its appearance had changed drastically.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Lorena was unsure.</p>

  <p>"Lorena, you're right. That is the Pear Hill." Harper's voice came from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Harper, who was inside the sun, could see the mountain more clearly.</p>

  <p>"But isn't the Pear Hill in the Source World? Why is it in the stomach of this giant clam?" Lorena asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe a major change has happened in the Source World,"</p>

  <p>Harper deduced.</p>

  <p>A major change in the Source World.</p>

  <p>When Lorena thought about this, her heart began to weigh down her body.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Yan, and Geoffrey were still in the Source World. She didn't know what was happening to them or how they were doing in the Source World.</p>

  <p>To say she wasn't worried about them would be a lie.</p>

  <p>As everyone was staring at the mountain, a head, which was twenty thousand times its original size, devoured a tombstone. When it did this, much to their dismay, it grew even larger. Now, it was about fifty thousand times its original size!</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the gigantic head then gave up on the other tombstones and headed straight for the divine land!</p>

  <p>Harper was on guard against the giant head, but when he shifted his attention to the Pear Hill, he forgot about it.</p>

  <p>Seeing the head inching closer, he uttered a final goodbye in his heart.</p>

  <p>He wanted to control the divine land to escape, but sadly, it was too late.</p>

  <p>The head had already reached the rear of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Those who were outside the divine land could only stare as the gigantic head began to open its mouth. They wore the saddest expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>The people inside the divine land were completely unaware of the impending crisis. They continued to live their lives and followed their routines.</p>

  <p>"The end of the divine land..."</p>

  <p>Tianming said in a detached manner.</p>

  <p>After all, it wouldn't be long before everyone else died.</p>

  <p>The end result would still be the same, even if anyone died a little earlier or a little later.</p>

  <p>He was no longer desperate but instead, rather calm after accepting his fate.</p>

  <p>"No, it's not." From the Lone Sword, the voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord rang out again.</p>

  <p>When Tianming heard this voice, he didn't feel anything anymore. No matter how powerful this old man had been, everything was already history.</p>

  <p>'A remnant soul wouldn't be able to save anyone, ' he thought. He felt that he had read the mind of the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>But he still asked indifferently, "Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because that is the hope," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finished speaking, Tianming saw a small, blurry figure appear on the top of the huge head.</p>

  <p>Compared to the head, the figure was but a speck of dust, but because of Tianming's astonishing eyesight, he managed to see it.</p>
