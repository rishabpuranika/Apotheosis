<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's hand was still raised in the air and he maintained his stance.</p>

  <p>The remaining six warriors of the Sacred race stared at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, the Sacred race had no trouble dealing with their enemies. The humans did not dare to fight them head-on. Of all the fights between the two races, humans hadn't won even once.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this team had a precedent of killing a human world lord.</p>

  <p>Three of the seven team members were masters of soul attack, such as the previously released "Primordial Inner Demon." The next three locked the opponent with the "Saint Devil Shackle." The last one, the leader of the team, killed the opponent with the "Saint Energy Strike," which he had been powering up for a long time.</p>

  <p>A team of the Sacred race usually consisted of seven warriors. The combined combat strength of the seven warriors was far higher than that of warriors of the same realms.</p>

  <p>This type of strategy was aimed at the stronger warriors. If they faced the warriors of the same realms or several enemies of lower realms, the seven warriors would use another set of tactics.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to resist the "Primordial Inner Demon" released by the three warriors. It was not purely a soul attack, but it was combined with some emotions. This not only tortured the soul of the opponent, but also befuddled their mind.</p>

  <p>Even if a world lord had a strong soul and a stable mind, their mind would be wiped out in a short period of time with almost no resistance.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't trained in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Primordial Inner Demon would have affected him.</p>

  <p>During the time that Luo Zheng had been practicing the Gods-intimidating Strike and comprehending the Emotion Closing Godly Way, the malicious Mu Ning had been too much for him to bear. He had become violent and bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>But after he had trained in the Mind Refining Tower of the Harmony race, Zheng's warrior spirit had been greatly strengthened. Now, the Primordial Inner Demon had no effect on his state of mind.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng came to his senses, he fought back and instantly killed a warrior of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The other warriors of the Sacred race were still stunned, apparently not realizing that one of their companions was already dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still had a smile on his face. This smile usually made people feel warm, like they were in the presence of a modest and polite gentleman.</p>

  <p>But in these warriors' eyes, Zheng's image was as terrible as a devil's. That smile looked malicious to them.</p>

  <p>The warriors hadn't felt fear like this in a long time. They hadn't faced a race yet that was powerful enough to surpass them.</p>

  <p>As they saw Luo Zheng approach one of them, the six warriors on the scene were shocked. It was obvious that this guy was someone they shouldn't cross.</p>

  <p>"Leave!"</p>

  <p>"Disperse! This guy is not to be underestimated!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Just before they reacted, Zheng's slow movements completely changed. His body flashed in the blink of an eye. Before one of the warriors could even turn around, he was lightly brushed by Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's finger brushed the top of the warrior's skull. A finger dent appeared in his skull before it totally caved in.</p>

  <p>The warrior opened his eyes wide in disbelief. He fell down uncontrollably, smashed his body hard on the ground, and was soon covered by a shower of blood.</p>

  <p>After killing the warrior, Luo Zheng didn't stop yet.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, Luo Zheng wasn't a brutal or cold-hearted man. He would be lenient wherever it was possible, but this didn't mean he was weak in character.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had slaughtered the human warriors in the universe without mercy. As a result, Luo Zheng would definitely not spare any of them.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the warriors of the Sacred race escaped was not slow, and they were well-coordinated. The five remaining warriors all escaped into different directions. This way, Luo Zheng could only chase and kill one of them. The other four could flee as far as they could in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng became a world lord, his speed became much faster than before.</p>

  <p>He locked his eyes on a yellow-garbed warrior as he chased after him.</p>

  <p>The warrior in yellow felt a strong gust of wind coming from behind. His face was full of bitterness as he thought, 'There are still four other warriors. Why is this guy chasing after me?'</p>

  <p>He had no time to think of a solution.</p>

  <p>As a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, he was unable to deal with Luo Zheng, a world lord.</p>

  <p>According to the strategy formulated by the Sacred race, when a group of warriors encountered a strong enemy, they must be completely dispersed to run away as far as they could. At least the enemy couldn't completely eradicate all of them and most of them could escape.</p>

  <p>The warrior suddenly changed his mind. He decided not to lead Luo Zheng away, but turned around and tried to fight back.</p>

  <p>He knew he would still be killed if he tried to run away, so he'd rather fight against Luo Zheng even if it cost him his life.</p>

  <p>This was the natural instinct of many creatures. Even if the rabbit was chased by a stronger beast, it would turn around to bite its enemy.</p>

  <p>"Life Vitality Explosion!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The life vitality inside the warrior's body surged out and exploded around him.</p>

  <p>This was a kind of skill that consumed one's life vitality.</p>

  <p>As the warrior's life vitality was consumed rapidly, it also expanded at a very fast speed. It turned into countless spikes that emerged all over his body. The warrior seemed like a hedgehog, with all the spikes that protruded from his body.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't react in time, he would certainly be skewered by the spikes mercilessly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's natural response was extremely fast. He had enough time to avoid these spikes, but he didn't really need to avoid them at all.</p>

  <p>He didn't stop in his tracks; he smashed the spikes directly with his own body and turned them into ashes.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the spikes broke off, Luo Zheng was only a short distance away from the warrior. Zheng's right hand shot out like a flash. He gently flicked the back of the warrior's head, as if brushing the dust off his body.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng paid no more attention to the warrior. He turned around and chased after another one.</p>

  <p>The warrior that Zheng's finger had touched suddenly trembled. After a few seconds, his lifeless body fell down to the ground heavily. Apparently, he was dead.</p>

  <p>"The third one is finished,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured and then chased after the fourth one.</p>

  <p>The warrior currently chased by Luo Zheng saw the scene that played not far away. His heart was in his throat. As he saw Luo Zheng chasing after him, he was scared out of his wits. When their eyes met, he felt as if his life was sucked out of his body. He circulated his life vitality and tried to escape as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Zheng just about seven to eight seconds to finish the third warrior.</p>

  <p>Then he launched on the air beneath his feet and flew a distance of about ten miles. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the fourth warrior.</p>

  <p>Aside from having trained in the Harmony race, Luo Zheng had also trained in the Wind Exterminating Valley. There, he had learned Holy Jay's comprehension and experience on various laws.</p>

  <p>After someone became a world lord, they could utilize the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>When a Supreme Lord used the Grand Teleportation, they could travel several supreme worlds. Luo Zheng was still currently unable to do so, but he could still use it to travel ten thousand miles in an instant. The Spirit Transformation Realm warrior had just fled a few hundred miles in a short span of time.</p>

  <p>"You...you... Who are you? You are a mere human world lord. Why are you so powerful?" the warrior asked after he realized that there was no point in running anymore.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know," Luo Zheng said with a smile. His ghost-like figure once again flew past the warrior. The moment his finger flicked out, there was a blazing white light under his feet. Luo Zheng had disappeared in front of the warrior. He began to chase after the fifth warrior.</p>

  <p>Then the sixth...the seventh...</p>

  <p>There was only one warrior of the Sacred race left, and Luo Zheng didn't kill him immediately.</p>

  <p>This warrior was the one who had stood on the black warship and looked down on Luo Zheng. As the leader of his team, he had the greatest strength.</p>

  <p>After the other six members trapped a strong opponent, the killing blow was dealt by this man!</p>

  <p>Because it took Luo Zheng some time to kill the other six warriors, their leader had already escaped two hundred miles in such a short time.</p>

  <p>While he ran for his life, he had almost pushed his strength to the limit.</p>

  <p>In comparison with the other warriors of the team, he was the most intelligent. He had already realized that Luo Zheng would be too much for him to deal with. He never looked back and didn't think about anything else but to escape with his life!</p>

  <p>He didn't know or care whether his companions were dead or not.</p>

  <p>At least, he was safe now.</p>

  <p>'I'm finally safe.'</p>

  <p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, a voice whispered in his ears. It scared him to his wits' end.</p>

  <p>"Hi, what's your name?"</p>
