  <p>
</p>

  <p>Because he practiced the Great Dominance Technique, Maha's movements gave off a strong sense of oppression.</p>

  <p>An ordinary warrior would feel great pressure facing Maha and their first instinct would be to submit to him without question.</p>

  <p>However, because of his cultivation level, Maha's Great Dominance Technique had no effect on the Gold Fighting Soul. The Emperor Soul Imprint in Zheng's soul also contained an Mu Ning that was by no means weaker than the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was calm as he faced Maha. "I believe this will be the last time we meet."</p>

  <p>Maha smiled and nodded. "Yes, I think so too."</p>

  <p>The two of them were the representatives of their respective universes: the two strongest martial artists second only to Supreme Lords. As a war broke out between these two universes, a fight between the two of them was unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Maha clenched his right hand into a fist and rubbed his left palm. He then gently stepped in the air and took the initiative to launch an attack!</p>

  <p>Words were of no use to Maha. He merely focused on dealing the deadly blow on Luo Zheng. He was determined to crush him along with the hopes and dreams that this entire universe pinned onto the young man.</p>

  <p>He did not even bother using a weapon. Maha simply went for Luo Zheng with his bare hands!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh…."</p>

  <p>In terms of speed or the burst of strength, Maha's attack was nothing special.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng saw the space behind Maha slightly shift and distort.</p>

  <p>When formidable strength was exerted on a warrior's body, their mass would in turn rise exponentially. Upon reaching a certain point, it would then start to suppress their surroundings and distort the space around them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was no stranger to this phenomenon, having experienced the same thing many times.</p>

  <p>It was just a bit surprising to see it done by Maha too.</p>

  <p>'What powerful strength!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked in his head. He never knew Maha could be this strong and it didn't help that he had no idea where this sort of strength came from.</p>

  <p>However, despite facing against such a powerful opponent, Luo Zheng felt extremely excited.</p>

  <p>Since Maha wanted to fight with brute force alone, then Luo Zheng would not hesitate to do the same.</p>

  <p>His punch wasn't very fast and it was absolutely possible for Luo Zheng to dodge it if he wanted to. However, instead of retreating, Luo Zheng decided to lower the center of his body and took a horse stance on the rock!</p>

  <p>"This Luo Zheng... he wants to take a punch from Maha head-on?" Supreme Lord Barrie murmured, having hidden himself in the dark.</p>

  <p>"That would be too disappointing..." Supreme Lord Noel said, shaking his head slightly.</p>

  <p>"He overestimates himself," another Supreme Lord remarked.</p>

  <p>Since Maha was the number one Godly Genius of the Sacred race with unparalleled strength and power, it was only natural for the Sacred Supreme Lords to watch over him during his battles.</p>

  <p>There was a time when Maha went to the Heavenly Melody Star to refine his body. This star was one of the Nine Divine Stars of the Murphy Universe and contained Murphy's strength source. A body refiner would be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort if they chose to refine themselves there.</p>

  <p>On this star was a Cyan Vitality Tree that had only bloomed once in the past countless years. Its flower withered after 40 million years while it still took it another 30 million years to produce a single fruit. Maha was able to greatly improve himself on this star since he was lucky enough to eat the Cyan Vitality Fruit that had absorbed large amount of strength source.</p>

  <p>However, to the Sacred Supreme Lords, this didn't have anything to do with luck at all. The Cyan Vitality Fruit was a divine object that couldn't be obtained by an ordinary person's luck. It was no doubt something that Murphy willed to happen. He wanted to bestow that fruit to Maha so he made the tree bloom and bear fruit just in time for him to take it.</p>

  <p>After consuming the fruit, Maha's strength rapidly increased to the point that the Supreme Lords' strength was now far inferior to his.</p>

  <p>This was the main reason why all the Supreme Lords were confident in the devastating power of Maha's punch!</p>

  <p>"Do you think Luo Zheng is a fool? The power that Maha erupted was enough to twist space itself. Since Luo Zheng dared to forcefully resist this punch, he must be confident in his own ability. I'm afraid that Maha will suffer a loss!" Supreme Lord Denzel argued with a sneer.</p>

  <p>He and Maha had originally been on different paths so he didn't really have any amicable relationship with the Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Of course, he hoped for Zheng's death but seeing Maha suffer a bit was a bonus.</p>

  <p>Striking down the strongest Godly Genius in the Evolutionary Universe was equivalent to completely destroying its momentum.</p>

  <p>In the end though, the Supreme Lord's remarks actually hit the nail on the head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not dodge and simply spread his left hand open while keeping his right hand balled into a fist. He too threw a punch towards Maha.</p>

  <p>As they both had reached such a high level of cultivation, any casual attack from these two would be powerful and perfectly executed. Since it was a head-on strike, Luo Zheng didn't even bother playing any tricks. His punch was directly aimed at Maha with no frills since he was extremely confident of his higher physical strength level.</p>

  <p>Maha, on the other hand, thought the same thing as Supreme Lord Barrie. To him, Luo Zheng had greatly overestimated himself for facing his strike head-on. It was very favorable for him to take advantage of Zheng's arrogance and directly smash him to meat paste. That would save him a lot of trouble in the future.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>A dull sound rang out the moment their fists collided.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still in the horse stance when his punch collided with Maha's.</p>

  <p>He was immediately thrown in the air while the hill he had previously been standing on was reduced to dust and rubble.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Maha's complexion had turned a shade whiter.</p>

  <p>The amount of force he sustained from Zheng's punch was much more powerful than the one he threw at him.</p>

  <p>His opponent was actually stronger than him and the gap between the two of them was enormous.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Maha was a vigilant warrior. As soon as he realized this fact, he quickly twisted his body and slid away from his opponent like a loach. His agile moves helped him offset Zheng's strength by eighty percent! However, the twenty percent from Zheng's attack that did manage to hit him still caused countless blood vessels in his body to explode.</p>

  <p>Fighting with their fists was a way to test the waters. Maha did not expect himself to suffer such a great loss.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, meanwhile, was very successful with his attack. However, he dared not drop his guard. Taking advantage of his opponent's disorientation, Luo Zheng suddenly grabbed Maha in an attempt to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Maha's strange bodily movement skills enabled him to simply slip through Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, Maha spat out a mouthful of blood, forming a clear line of blood in the air.</p>

  <p>This scene shocked all the Sacred Supreme Lords watching immensely.</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord Denzel, who had correctly predicted this outcome, was surprised.</p>

  <p>Despite guessing that Zheng's strength surpassed Maha's, Supreme Lord Denzel did not expect the gap between the two to be that huge!</p>

  <p>It seemed that the strength of these two Godly Geniuses was on completely different levels.</p>

  <p>However, it was not enough to completely fluster the Sacred Supreme Lords. Maha's injuries weren't too serious and physical strength alone was not a deciding factor to the match. After all, there were many ways to beat a stronger opponent than just brute strength.</p>

  <p>The ordinary Sacred warriors, on the other hand, felt less than calm. The only thing they saw was Luo Zheng defeating Maha with a single punch.</p>

  <p>"Is the battle going to end with the first punch?"</p>

  <p>"He only used one punch to make the Godly Genius bleed... unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"We're finished. This Luo Zheng guy is too strong!"</p>

  <p>The Sacred warriors of Iron Moon City lamented while the human warriors rejoiced.</p>

  <p>"Haha, no one under the level of Supreme Lord is stronger than Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell? Is this Maha really a Godly Genius? All it took was one punch to make him bleed."</p>

  <p>"Come on, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>These world lords weren't content cheering on the sidelines, they also took out their precious Roaring Tokens and announced Zheng's amazing feat to the entire Evolutionary Universe. This news was extremely inspiring and greatly boosted the morale of everyone in the Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>Maha distanced himself until he was around ten thousand feet away from Luo Zheng, only then did he manage to stabilize himself and wipe the blood from his mouth.</p>

  <p>'He's gonna be harder to deal with than I thought, ' Maha couldn't help but think to himself. This small injury was nothing but he had to reassess Zheng's strength immediately.</p>

  <p>Physical strength wasn't a necessarily critical factor in winning fights but it still could give a warrior an edge. Since he didn't have any advantage over Luo Zheng on physical strength, Maha would be forced into a passive stance. He needed to reconsider his entire strategy.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't accord him that luxury. The young man suddenly raised his right hand, summoning an icy blue flame that completely wrapped around his palm. With the blazing power of the Space Law, a single step caused Luo Zheng to move ten thousand feet forward, just to reach behind Maha. He then raised his arm and slapped his opponent across the back.</p>
