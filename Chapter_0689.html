<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since passing the Cloud Road challenge, Luo Zheng hadn't used his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Seeing a fully formed sword spirit was unusual, and only a few possessed one, even amongst martial artists at the Internal Elixir Realm, but, Zheng's sword spirit was already fully formed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew next to nothing about his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Typically, after someone went to the Killing Sword Mountain, he'd get a large amount of unformed sword spirit. After that, the warrior had the challenge of forming the mass.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng achieved, when he molded his sword spirit in one sitting was an unprecedented feat that happened because of the Demon Night. The sword spirit formed after Luo Zheng defeated the young girl from the Demon Night, without him having time even to meditate before the sword spirit took the shape of the girl from Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Unsure of the reason, Luo Zheng had asked the cyan dragon about the sword spirit, but all the cyan dragon could tell him was that the Demon Night was mighty enough to command a divine realm, which meant the race wasn't inferior to the Genuine Dragon. And the secrets of the powerful Demon Night were unknown by any other.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Zheng couldn't deduce the mystery.</p>

  <p>Up until now, Luo Zheng hadn't seen Lily's true power, but since their encounter with the giant sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor, her power grew rapidly.</p>

  <p>As the black turtles charged at them, Luo Zheng gave Lily a command and watched motionlessly. Lily looked like a ribbon of red crimson silk streaking as she darted at the turtles with the massive sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor slung over her shoulder effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Each turtle was one hundred feet long, and the four-foot thick shell made each turtle a challenge for Luo Zheng to slay. Being that thick shelled made the black turtles hardy. Though they moved quite slowly, it was still a big challenge to kill them before they were close to the pagoda.</p>

  <p>Whereas, quite the contrary, Lily sliced through the sluggish beasts as easily as hacking into watermelon. The thick shell was nothing more than a piece of paper under the might of the sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor. Lily's lithe form gracefully flexed as she swung the colossal, sharp sword, and slaughtered every turtle in short order.</p>

  <p>After completing the task she was ordered to do, Lily stood expressionlessly and still, looking like a gorgeous, carved puppet.</p>

  <p>As he sat quietly on the pagoda, Luo Zheng issued a command mentally. In response to Zheng's summons, Lily instantly turned into a red shadow and returned to the pagoda.</p>

  <p>Confused, the middle-aged martial artist's eyes widened as he stared at Lily's slender figure, and said, "Zheng's sword spirit is extraordinary!!"</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary? How so?" Although Xiao and Michael were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm and were both quite powerful, more powerful than the middle-aged martial artist, they didn't know more than it was a sword spirit, since neither of them wielded a sword.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged martial artist reached into his space ring and pulled out a long, high-level fairy-weapon sword, and gently swung it. A slightly taller, resolute-looking figure, dressed entirely in black appeared next to him holding two swords, one ebony, and the other white.</p>

  <p>"This is my sword spirit. The difference between Zheng's and mine is obvious, I assume," stated the elder in a bored tone as he gestured in the direction of the slender sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Looking the piece up and down, Michael sized it up and after a moment nodded, "Truly it is quite different from yours!"</p>

  <p>Smirking, the middle-aged martial artist asked, "How does mine differ?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yours is very ugly!" said Michael.</p>

  <p>"Uh..." The response left the middle-aged man dumbfounded momentarily.</p>

  <p>Xiao chuckled and stated, "Michael is right about how hideous your sword spirit is!"</p>

  <p>Truly, it was quite an ugly sword spirit. There wasn't even a distinct line between the eyes or nose. All they could tell was that it was shaped like a man. The middle-aged martial artist was both frustrated and amused at what he was told, "Yes, it's ugly. But, that's not the point I was trying to make."</p>

  <p>The formation of a sword spirit was a lengthy process, during which the sword spirit was influenced by its owner, and a sword spirit respectively had its figure at the end of the process. It took more than forty years for the middle-aged martial artist to form the one he showed them.</p>

  <p>Aside from the fact that it was nearly impossible for Luo Zheng to have formed a sword spirit at such a young age, albeit, there were always a few exceptionally gifted who could. But, Zheng's sword spirit was nearly identical to a real, living, breathing woman!</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword spirit, resembled a woman so closely that from her temperament and appearance, right down to the strands of hair, she could pass for a human woman! A sword spirit like this would need hundreds, maybe thousands of years before looking flawless like Lily.</p>

  <p>It took a while for the middle-aged martial artist to explain to Xiao and Michael.</p>

  <p>Since the middle-aged man was one of the best swordsmen in Central Region and had devoted himself to swordsmanship over dozens of years, he would know about sword spirits. Add to it, his sword intent was at the consummation level, which gave him an insight into sword spirits that most people could never comprehend.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng showed Lily to Tianming, Kenneth and Ning Yudie. Tianming was in Eastern Region when Luo Zheng showed her off, and it was impossible for him to know anything because he didn't have a sword spirit then, or now.</p>

  <p>As for Kenneth and Ning Yudie, they weren't swordsmen, therefore, they couldn't pick out subtle differences.</p>

  <p>But, that wasn't the case for the middle-aged martial artist. Hence, compared to Michael and Xiao, he was far more surprised when he saw the sword spirit, Lily.</p>

  <p>"Hundreds or thousands of years? Is that even plausible?" asked Michael, a shocked expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged martial artist nodded and calmly stated, "I'm pretty sure that it would take hundreds, possibly thousands of years to form a sword spirit like this!"</p>

  <p>Xiao sighed, rolled his eyes and softly added, "Cole, don't talk in such absolutes... Who had the confidence to say Eddie would be the most powerful martial artist in Central Region years ago? And look at him now, he's not even forty years old now!"</p>

  <p>At the mention of Eddie, they all fell silent.</p>

  <p>Among the independent martial artists in the Central Region, Eddie, the Evil East Lord, was considered nearly a freak!</p>

  <p>In the Central Region there were martial artists who were backed by a sect, and there were others, out on their own known as independent martial artists. Men who joined a sect were usually more powerful than independent martial artists. Sects had a large variety of resources enabling them to train disciples more effectively which meant there were always many powerful martial artists in the sects.</p>

  <p>However, independent martial artists were not a negligible force in the Central Region because of their tremendous numbers. At least six out of ten were not in a sect. Compared to the disciples from sects, the independent martial artists were no match to them.</p>

  <p>But, they had greater numbers. There were several super talents among the millions of independent martial artists! Though the independent martial artists weren't protected or trained by a sect, they were usually more powerful and famous than those with a sect backing them.</p>

  <p>Independent martial artists, like the Venerable Starry, became famous over time and their strength was no less than that of the leaders of the sects.</p>

  <p>They were elders who had already made a name during hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>But, Eddie was different.</p>

  <p>His reputation rose, shooting like a comet through the heavens and he became the most powerful man in the Central Region! Even the World Commercial Alliance, Ethereal Spirit Sect, Cloud Hall and the other grade four sects didn't dare offend him because he was the mightiest man in all of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Allegedly, Eddie had demanded the head of the Cloud Hall to give him a female martial artist that possessed a Purple Power body. Cloud Hall had no choice but to obey.</p>

  <p>It was unusual for men as powerful as him to not be ambitious. There was word on the street that Eddie's goal was to unite all of the Central Region and found an eternal kingdom!</p>

  <p>If he achieved his goal, the World Commercial Alliance and Ethereal Spirit Sect would be the first to fall!</p>

  <p>Given their long life spans, it was highly plausible that powerful men such as Xiao and Michael would witness the storm that would ensue when Eddie accomplished his goals. No one could be sure how the World Commercial Alliance would end.</p>

  <p>At the mere mention of Eddie's name, everyone fell silent, as they felt the dark cloud descending on the World Commercial Alliance. As a matter of fact, Eddie was trouble for the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the sole fifth grade sect, too!</p>

  <p>"Xiao, you mean to say that Luo Zheng will rise up like Eddie did?" questioned Michael.</p>

  <p>Xiao shook his head thoughtfully and said, "I cannot say if that will happen.</p>

  <p>There are hundreds of thousands of martial artists with the ability to become someone like Eddie. Although Luo Zheng is more powerful compared to his peers and he is remarkably talented, it'd be virtually impossible for him to be as mighty as Eddie. But, still, he's far more likely to become that mighty than his peers!"</p>

  <p>Michael laughed nervously and added, "Even if that's true, the World Commercial Alliance cannot use any help from him. Though he is here for the pre-qualifying match, he is a disciple from Cloud Hall, not the World Commercial Alliance. However, he's still someone who likely won't fail to garner our favor."</p>
