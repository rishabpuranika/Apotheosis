<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1411 The Sword Practicing Hall </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>They would never have believed that a miracle would really come if it were not for the sudden appearance of those sword clouds.</p>

  <p>It was surreal, to say the least. They had stayed there for tens of thousands of years holding onto the hope that one day, a miracle would appear and absolve them of all the hardship they had endured. It wasn't easy. Such a long time of waiting was sure to weaken any person's resolve no matter how strong their will was when they started. All those years waiting had made them forget just exactly what kind of miracle they were waiting for.</p>

  <p>Until, of course, the sword clouds arrived. It was truly that miracle, coupled with their long-standing suffering of waiting here for tens of thousands of years, that resulted in their comprehension of around thirty-percent of the Gods-intimidating Strike. That alone, however, was not enough to assure them of greatness. Their old age and subpar talents would still make it difficult for them to achieve great things in the future.</p>

  <p>Thousands and thousands of years were wasted just meditating by the huge stone. They had completely neglected nurturing their inner world and consolidating their cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Still, these two had enough knowledge between them to make a name for themselves at some lower ranked sacred place somewhere.</p>

  <p>In fact, their futures weren't half-bad. The slightly younger warrior, Damian Xu, would go on to become an elder of a certain great sect. The warrior named Landry Chen, on the other hand, would become a swordsmanship master who would eventually impart his understanding of the Gods-intimidating Strike to the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Layla tilted her head as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng. "How much were you able to assimilate?" she asked with a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, not much," Luo Luo Zheng replied with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>Layla sighed. "I think I grasped around fifteen percent of the Gods-intimidating Strike. It's unfortunate that this kind of skill is incompatible with my state of mind, which means it's going to be harder for me to master it."</p>

  <p>Her words were humble but there was that underlying tone of pride in her voice. Majority of the warriors, after all, were only able to grasp five to ten percent. Layla was probably the one who was able to absorb the most knowledge.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she still couldn't hope to be on par with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite what he had said, Luo Luo Zheng had almost completely mastered this sword skill.</p>

  <p>He had already swallowed those white sword shadows and honed his sword intent prior to the arrival of the clouds. The Gods-intimidating Strike now felt as if it was custom-made for him.</p>

  <p>One shouldn't be mistaken though. It wasn't purely by just absorbing those white sword shadows that he was able to fully comprehend the skill. A few years ago, back when Luo Luo Zheng was still a nature creature, he was able to learn the most valuable of all lessons: the greatest truths were the simplest, and so were the greatest men. His sword intent and its compatibility with the Gods-intimidating Strike was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>It was the consolidation of these factors that enabled Luo Luo Zheng to fully comprehend the skill but only by using the uncontrollable sword intent would he be able to perform this sword strike!</p>

  <p>He understood that despite learning how to use it, actually utilizing the Gods-intimidating Strike in battle was a different matter altogether given the fact that such an attack required an immense source of force and power.</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord Sword himself devoted over a million years just practicing the technique. Luo Zheng's strength and cultivation base were far inferior to that man of legend, which meant he couldn't really be sure of himself when it came to utilizing the skill properly and effectively.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still pleased though. The comprehension and acquisition of this skill was another addition to his roster of trump cards he collected here in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>One month later, Luo Luo Zheng and the other warriors finally returned to the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Some had chosen to go out and gain more experience while others chose to return to their own families and deal with some important matters.</p>

  <p>Layla, who lived right across from Luo Luo Zheng, stood outside her residence while she waited for her brother.</p>

  <p>He had managed to defeat Luo Luo Zheng and obtained his freedom but he wasn't able to return with her to the Mist Palace. It would take Lincoln a bit more time before he could cross the supreme worlds to find the Mist Palace and reunite with his sister.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter that much, especially to Layla who was practically glowing with happiness and excitement at the thought of finally being with her brother again.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he really made Layla feel so dejected after Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>But ultimately, he ended up losing to her brother. This fact alone was enough to serve as a consolation prize. The young woman relished in the fact that it was her kin that was able to defeat Luo Luo Zheng at something.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was going to be staying in the Mist Palace for a few days. During this time, he constantly observed everything in his inner world. The flow of chaotic energy had started to slow down but it still hadn't been completely liquefied yet. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but feel depressed with the slow progress his chaotic energy had made to turn into the sea.</p>

  <p>He was also on the process of recalling the Gods-intimidating Strike from the sword clouds...</p>

  <p>He really wanted to perform this move after knowing that most warriors from the Passing the Torch experienced a tremendous increase in strength because of it.</p>

  <p>The news regarding the revelation of Supreme Lord Sword's secret had spread all throughout the universe like wildfire.</p>

  <p>Warriors who had spent a lot of time in front of the huge stone but left the Orange Sea World before the event, either willingly or unwillingly, naturally learned of this matter.</p>

  <p>The news astonished them and quite a lot cried in regret for giving up so early. Only two warriors had been able to prevail and hold onto their spots until the very end.</p>

  <p>Back to Luo Luo Zheng: the young man still felt incredibly frustrated over the fact that he had fully mastered a skill but had no opportunity to use it.</p>

  <p>He forgot this matter for the time being until one day when he arrived in the depths of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>This area had an Illusion Space where warriors could practice their skills and hone their strength.</p>

  <p>It was late at night when Luo Luo Zheng arrived so there were currently no other warriors who were using the Illusion Space. It was all just him.</p>

  <p>He quickly entered the hall and found a signboard beside it that read,</p>

  <p>"Sword Practicing Hall".</p>

  <p>Of course, this hall wasn't just limited to swords. Saber, spear, and fist practitioners could very well practice their arts here.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly opened up the Illusion Space and the scenery in front of him suddenly changed. Instead of a hall, he was met with a huge mountain range!</p>

  <p>It was so big that he could see neither the summit nor the foot of the mountain!</p>

  <p>This entire scenery was bathed in a gold and silver glow. Coupled with its immense proportions, the view in front of Luo Luo Zheng could be described as nothing short of ethereal.</p>

  <p>He had never seen such a sight since this kind of scenery could only exist within the Illusion Space. Everything he saw was created by divine textures and wasn't real.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, Luo Luo Zheng saw this great mountain range also possessed a ton of marks.</p>

  <p>There were countless marks all over it!</p>

  <p>Sword marks, saber marks, arrow marks, spear marks, fist marks...</p>

  <p>This place had served as a training ground for the entire warrior population of the Mist Palace, so it was only natural for these marks to have accumulated over the years.</p>

  <p>"It seems I've come to the right place,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remarked with glee, eager to finally practice the sword skill he had been itching to try for days now! It was truly too bad that there was nobody here in the Mist Palace he could ask to try this skill on.</p>

  <p>Wasting no time, Luo Luo Zheng quickly unsheathed his Thunder Wind Divine Sword and pointed the tip towards the enormous mountain range!</p>

  <p>This simple movement caused such a great difference in his Mu Ning. It felt as if Luo Zheng's gaze alone would be enough to cut through rock and split this entire mountain range!</p>

  <p>"The Gods-intimidating Strike is unable to gather momentum?</p>

  <p>I have to brandish the sword the moment I raise my hand.</p>

  <p>No momentum, no hesitation? I must forget my emotions. This mentality has already been tainted with a trace of divinity..."</p>

  <p>According to legend, it was only when one forgot emotions that they could become a True God. Supreme Lord Sword had done this very thing: he threw away all emotions in order to create this one, powerful sword strike.</p>

  <p>This kind of mentality was overwhelmingly wondrous. Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he was able to grasp it momentarily before it suddenly slipped out of his mind in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>This was normal. An epiphany was always something that came and went instantly. Ideas were fleeting and warriors would often have to work hard in grasping their slippery conclusions time and time again. It was okay since Luo Luo Zheng was only intending to practice the move for the time being. The epiphany might be quick and slippery but it was sure to come back again in the future.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng threw all hesitation aside, his sword intent flashed and emitted a faint light as it shot out from his long sword...</p>

  <p>The sword intent was uncontrollable as it constantly spread throughout the space but that was the point! It should not and did not need to be controlled! Luo Luo Zheng could only follow his own comprehension as he thrust the sword towards the direction of the mountain range!</p>

  <p>He quickly felt a tremendous change in the sword intent. It seemed to have a mind of its own as it forged its own way with the attack...</p>
