</p>

  <p>The rays of sword energy merged at a very slow speed like when they got split just now.</p>

  <p>There were 128 rays of sword energy which merged into 64 rays. In addition, the Emotion Closing Godly Way contained in them became stronger.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the mysteries of the Emotion Closing Godly Way finally revealed themselves during the fusion process.</p>

  <p>"I got it...</p>

  <p>This Eight Diagrams Chart can continuously decompose the Emotion Closing Godly Way and reveal its innermost essence to me!</p>

  <p>What an ingenious method!"</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng thought that it still couldn't compare to the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>After all, the Infinity Ruler could hold all the energies that belonged to the three thousand Godly Ways. It was only that Zheng's cultivation was limited, so he could not fully display them.</p>

  <p>According to what Fuxi and the Chaos Ancient God had said, it wouldn't work to merge the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Zheng refused to give up.</p>

  <p>Chiyou had passed down the Infinity Ruler to his mother, Lorena, who then gave it to his father, Mike, who had lastly chosen to give it to him, Zheng.</p>

  <p>There must be a reason why such a thing happened.</p>

  <p>Besides, even if he couldn't make it in the end, the power of the Ways-blending Energy alone would be of great help to him at this current time.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had no reason to give up.</p>

  <p>After he thought about it for a while, he stared at the sword energy intently and concentrated on comprehending it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, things had changed on the other side.</p>

  <p>The people of the Warden race had retreated to one side of the Equality Altar.</p>

  <p>Since Fuxi had spoken, the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm present didn't make things difficult for them anymore.</p>

  <p>Anyway, all they wanted to do was leave. A long as the Warden race didn't stop them, then they would have nothing more to worry about.</p>

  <p>As for the Warden race, they were now aware that the situation was hopeless. They would only bring about their own destruction if they persisted.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Fuxi had already told them that even Herbert had given up.</p>

  <p>From there, it proved that the free faction was right, and it was indeed unnecessary for the conservative faction to push through.</p>

  <p>Just then, the leader of the Warden race slowly approached Luther and unwrapped the bag on his back.</p>

  <p>The bag contained thirteen blue short swords.</p>

  <p>There were only a few people in the Warden race who were qualified to use those short swords, and Luther was one of them.</p>

  <p>He held a short sword in one hand and turned around. He nodded at Emily, then said, "Master! I'm ready!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile tugged at the corners of Emily's lips. She restrained her excitement, grabbed Luther, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>She searched all the way through the Curse Chain behind her and soon arrived at the top of a high platform. The Curse Chain that bound Emily was tied to this high platform.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luther didn't hesitate too much and proceeded to extract the life vitality in his body and poured it into the short sword.</p>

  <p>As the blue light on the surface of the short sword glowed increasingly brighter, he brandished the blade and slashed at the Curse Chain...</p>

  <p>"Ding..."</p>

  <p>There was a small, ringing sound.</p>

  <p>Then, the short sword cut a small, golden bug into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Curse Chain seemed to be formed from numerous golden bugs that were connected to each other. Yet, that was only what it looked like.</p>

  <p>In fact, the entire chain behind Emily was only a bug.</p>

  <p>When Luther shattered that one bug, he had shattered all of the other bugs--which meant that the entire Curse Chain broke into pieces at the same time!</p>

  <p>"Finally!</p>

  <p>It's now broken," Emily exclaimed in relief.</p>

  <p>She had been once so desperate, that she thought that she could never leave this world.</p>

  <p>This damned world had shackled her for too long!</p>

  <p>Up until now, she still didn't know Herbert's purpose. Even Fuxi didn't give a complete explanation.</p>

  <p>However, those things didn't matter now. The important thing was that she could leave and go back to the Source World!</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Luther," Emily said lightly. She was now visibly relaxed.</p>

  <p>Even though the space was narrow, she still felt free as a bird that flew high in the sky.</p>

  <p>"You are my master. It's what I should do for you." He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"All the disciples of our Rose Sect are female. You'd be the only exception if we accept you," she said with pursed lips.</p>

  <p>She had originally refused to admit him as her disciple, and did not intend to accept him. She had only taught him to help him become a True God in the quickest time possible.</p>

  <p>Now, she was in a good mood and thus decided to announce that she had formally accepted him as her disciple.</p>

  <p>After Emily finished speaking, she grabbed Luther and disappeared from the high platform. They both returned to the Equality Altar.</p>

  <p>Next, it was Timotheus' turn to take Luther to search for the Curse Chain that bound him. The other exiles from different races looked anxious as they waited for their turns.</p>

  <p>Although they also knew that their turn would come sooner or later, it was such an important thing to them. How could they possibly restrain their eagerness?</p>

  <p>The Curse Chains of the exiles present had been cut off by Luther. Next, it was the Wild Gods' turns...</p>

  <p>About half a day later, the Curse Chains that bound everyone present had been broken.</p>

  <p>"Now, there's only Zheng left," said Emily as she gazed at the hill.</p>

  <p>However, Timotheus looked worried. "I don't know what Zheng is doing.</p>

  <p>He hasn't returned yet," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Although Emily didn't think that Fuxi would hurt Zheng, no one actually knew what crazy thing he could do since he had been trapped for so long.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait a bit more," she answered. She didn't dare to disturb them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the rays of sword energy continued to merge in the Eight Diagrams Chart.</p>

  <p>The 128 rays of sword energy that had merged into 64 now fused to 32.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to deduce as the sword energy merged some more.</p>

  <p>"The sixty-four streams of sword energy still contain Ripping Consciousness, but the state of forgetting myself is much more advanced...</p>

  <p>Forgetting myself...</p>

  <p>Myself...</p>

  <p>In the thirty-two streams of sword energy, I can feel something that has surpassed the notion of the state of forgetting myself."</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>It was like a circular cycle. The streams of sword energy continued to merge and split over and over…</p>

  <p>At that point, the thoughts in his mind became much clearer.</p>

  <p>When those streams of sword energy finally merged into one, a strange light suddenly flashed in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"In essence, the Ripping Consciousness is still to negate the self consciousness. But in subconsciousness, one still can't get rid of their own consciousness...</p>

  <p>The streams of sword energy ranging from the 64th stream of sword energy to the 16th stream of sword energy, form the Formless State!</p>

  <p>While the streams of sword energy ranging from the 8th stream of sword energy to the last one, form the state of Nothingness In One!</p>

  <p>In essence, the Emotion Closing Godly Way is a kind of virtual energy!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when Zheng clearly saw what the sword energy had revealed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, his understanding of the Emotion Closing Godly Way had broken several bottlenecks in a row!</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Such an amount of enlightenment caused him to fall into some kind of magical state.</p>

  <p>In addition, the golden light that surrounded his soul was now quite dazzling!</p>

  <p>Still, he did not forget himself nor did he turn into an emotionless, statue-like being. He was simply in a state of nothingness.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi saw Zheng who was in such a state, his eyes twitched slightly as he leaned more on the tombstone.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng had help from the Eight Diagrams Chart, but the speed of Zheng's comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way still surprised him a little.</p>
