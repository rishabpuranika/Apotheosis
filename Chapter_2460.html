  <p>
</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods were scared to death.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had been killed by the numerous Three-Element Snakes and Death Bringers.</p>

  <p>They finally managed to ward off the sea of snakes. Everyone was still high on the joy of surviving the disaster.</p>

  <p>Nobody had expected the red rays of light to burst out of the heavy mist again.</p>

  <p>These rays of light moved at a high speed, and there was no time for anyone to dodge them.</p>

  <p>By the time they realized what was happening, the rays had enveloped more than ten top-rank True Gods within them. The flesh and bones of the top-rank True Gods were like ice on a hot summer day, melting quickly and turning into a pool of liquid.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there were a few top-rank True Gods who knew it was better to be cautious.</p>

  <p>When one of these True Gods saw what was happening, he used his avatar such that it stood protectively before him.</p>

  <p>Others soon followed suit.</p>

  <p>There were some people with huge avatars, such as the True God of Zhao Clan, whose avatar was a massive elephant.</p>

  <p>But some avatars were tiny. A True God simply had a long sword as his avatar and it couldn't block him at all.</p>

  <p>As the red rays of light swept around, the True Gods decided to bring all the avatars together to block the light. This way, they finally managed to completely block the red light.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard! Are you okay?" Solomon exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan were excited.</p>

  <p>They had gone through enough despair and now, were thankful that they had been lucky enough to survive.</p>

  <p>"Did you kill the Snake Spirit?"</p>

  <p>"What is going on with these rays?"</p>

  <p>One after the other, the True Gods began to ask questions.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have the patience to answer them. With Yan on his back, He walked behind the wall made of the avatars and carefully put her down.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect to see her stand the moment he put her down. It looked like she wasn't hurt at all.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Zheng, for carrying me all the way here," Yan smiled.</p>

  <p>Zheng was relieved at how lively she sounded but he pretended to be unhappy.</p>

  <p>"Looks like you are doing just fine!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be angry, Zheng," Yan said, shaking Zheng's arm on seeing that he was unhappy. "It's just that you haven't carried me for a long time."</p>

  <p>She had been so relieved lying on Zheng's back, as if every danger and tribulation were far away from her.</p>

  <p>This trust bloomed from the bottom of her heart and could never be erased.</p>

  <p>Even Harold, who was much stronger than Zheng, was incapable of making her feel this way.</p>

  <p>"You're still a naughty child!"</p>

  <p>Zheng tapped her forehead and said with a smile. "We're even now. I am not angry anymore."</p>

  <p>When Yan was a kid, Zheng used this method to teach her a lesson, and would make her cry every time he did it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng turned around, he could feel his chest tighten.</p>

  <p>Probably, in the Luo Clan, Yan was the one whose pursuit was the simplest.</p>

  <p>She only hoped for the whole family to be reunited.</p>

  <p>For other clans, this wish could not be simpler.</p>

  <p>But it had become difficult for the Luo Clan to fulfill such a wish.</p>

  <p>'No matter how difficult this task is, I will complete it! Our family will eventually reunite!' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"What? You encountered the Multiple Antennae Snake again while dealing with the Snake Spirit?"</p>

  <p>"These rays of red light have been released by the Multiple Antennae Snake!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard's reply shocked the crowd yet again.</p>

  <p>Until now, more than two hundred of them had perished, leaving them with only a hundred warriors and great losses.</p>

  <p>They might just be the next to die.</p>

  <p>They did not have the ability to struggle against the powerful incarnations of their fears.</p>

  <p>"Other than the Multiple Antennae Snake, we also encountered a consummate True God who could turn himself into thunder. Do you know who he is?" Reinhard asked.</p>

  <p>The incarnations of their fears hadn't appeared out of nowhere. The consummate True God must have left a deep impression on someone among them.</p>

  <p>"What? A consummate True God?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>"This task is just impossible!"</p>

  <p>A grey-haired old man said, horrified, "A man of thunder? I think I know him. Are you talking about Atlas?"</p>

  <p>"Atlas?"</p>

  <p>"This man had fought against the entire divine land in the past. He was a badass!"</p>

  <p>"I've seen his history! Atlas cultivated the Thunderstorm Godly Way. He could really turn himself into lightning and thunder and could never be killed."</p>

  <p>Atlas fighting against the whole divine land was a part of history and had taken place many divine eras ago.</p>

  <p>It was so long ago that they found it difficult to recall at the drop of a hat.</p>

  <p>As soon as the old man mentioned him, Reinhard also clapped his hands and said, "Yes! I hadn't thought of him!"</p>

  <p>The old man laughed bitterly and said, "I was still young at that time. Atlas killed 3, 300 people of our Shan Clan. I didn't expect this place to make me experience the horrible man a second time."</p>

  <p>The old man had lived through many divine eras.</p>

  <p>The passage of such a long time had not been enough to erase the fear in his heart. One could only imagine the extent of the damage that Atlas had caused him.</p>

  <p>He looked doubtfully at the gathering and then shook his head. "That's impossible! No way! How can you survive an encounter with Atlas?"</p>

  <p>At this, the other top-rank True Gods also looked at Reinhard and Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>It was already rather impossible to believe that the four of them had successfully killed the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>They had then come across the Multiple Antennae Snake, and the attacks from a consummate True God. Despite all this, they had returned safe and sound.</p>

  <p>It was nothing short of a miracle.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've heard of Atlas too. The gap between a consummate True God and a top-rank True God is simply too big."</p>

  <p>"It was said that Atlas was so much stronger than a normal consummate True God. But in the end, the Holy Beings had exiled him.</p>

  <p>That was how he disappeared."</p>

  <p>Reinhard smiled bitterly at these confused voices. He looked meaningfully at Zheng, but didn't know how to explain it.</p>

  <p>'Shall I tell them the truth? That Zheng forced Atlas to retreat just using a sword strike? They won't believe it!'</p>

  <p>Reinhard wouldn't have believed it either if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Duke, Gage, Donne, Tyrone, Ellis, and all others from the alliance of wealthy clans remained silent.</p>

  <p>Duke's face was etched a perpetual sneer.</p>

  <p>It didn't make any difference whether Reinhard was telling the truth or not.</p>

  <p>It had been far beyond Duke's expectations when they had managed to kill the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>Even if the four warriors had the strength to escape from a consummate True God, they would finally have to face a fiend.</p>

  <p>Long story short, after Duke followed them into the debate venue, every warrior here would die.</p>

  <p>Just as the True Gods had begun to doubt Reinhard's words, Zheng looked at the thick white mist in the distance and said to the True Gods, "Don't you think the design of the debate venue is unreasonable?"</p>
