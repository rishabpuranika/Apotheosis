<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3292 The Legendary Fire Crow </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Liusu's preternatural fire had always been considered to be one of the mysteries in the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the early days, even Samuel didn't know about why it existed.</p>

  <p>Since Liusu left the divine land, her cultivation base had improved greatly. She was able to hone her preternatural fire even if she did not know where it came from.</p>

  <p>It soon dawned on Zheng just how serious things were. "The counterattack of the fire?" he asked with his heart beating rapidly in his chest. "What happened to her?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge heard the anxiety in Zheng's voice. She was actually skeptical about Zheng's identity, and his reaction confirmed her guess. "This has nothing to do with you, right?" she replied with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>"Tell me! What happened to her?" Zheng clenched his fist and stepped closer.</p>

  <p>His aura grew boldly.</p>

  <p>He left the girls with Feng Ge because he thought that the Phoenix Palace was a safe place as it was the core of the whole Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect anything bad to happen. Now he was worried.</p>

  <p>Zheng's reaction surprised Feng Ge. He was standing directly in front of her with the veins of his neck bulging in anger. Feng Ge summoned a golden whip and charged it at Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng snickered. The divine flames of the Sun Crow race had already failed to harm his physical body while he was in the Source World. It was much less of a threat to him right then.</p>

  <p>He reached for the divine flames and broke the golden whip into pieces.</p>

  <p>With the other hand, he grabbed Feng Ge by the collar and shouted, "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"She...she's fine!" Feng Ge stammered. "Why are you so angry?" she added with a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>A huge wave of relief swept over Zheng. For a moment, he was calm. And then he quickly realized Feng Ge's real purpose. It was obvious that she was testing him.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge calmed down and sneered. "You are indeed a disciple of our Oneness Sky Palace, Tianxing. Or should I call you Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened. His identity was finally revealed. He could no longer deceive Feng Ge. What she had just said meant she'd been suspicious of him for a while. Zheng sighed. "Is Liusu really okay?" he asked once more.</p>

  <p>"My mother helped her. How could she not be fine? Once her bloodline is activated, her strength will greatly increase. She has such a great talent; it would be a great pity if she wasted it by staying by your side all the time," remarked Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Her bloodline?" Zheng's brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Liusu was Samuel's biological child. Although the bloodline of the Han Clan was certainly not bad in the divine land, it was nothing special in the Source World.</p>

  <p>According to Feng Ge, Liusu seemed to have a rare bloodline.</p>

  <p>"She has the Fire Crow bloodline. Her fire is called the 'Sprite Fire',"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge explained. "The Fire Crow is a legendary bird with a crane-like body, a single leg, and a white beak. It's a kind of firebird. Its presence means that a fire-related disaster will occur. The fire that took place in the Phoenix Palace has proved this legend."</p>

  <p>"Fire disasters?"</p>

  <p>Zheng recalled Liusu mentioning this in the past. When she was a child, she was unable to control her preternatural fire. She would cause a fire from time to time. The Han clan had to arrange a private palace for her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's words coincided with that story.</p>

  <p>But why and how did Liusu acquire such blood line?</p>

  <p>Even if the Han Clan had any kind of blood inheritance, it could only be related to the Nine Li race. Zheng could not understand how the Fire Crow could have anything to do with their bloodline.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been honest with me. I've been so good to my three disciples."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge gazed coldly at Zheng as she continuously produced divine flames of the Sun Crow race to heat the pot.</p>

  <p>She was able to bond with Liusu and the other girls previously. While they did not disclose their origins, they did talk about their relationships with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dorothy hated Feng Ge, especially after Zheng had saved her from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At that time, Feng Ge wasn't able to figure out Zheng's identity. She was in awe of him. If she didn't figure it out this time, he would have pretended to be someone else for much longer.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge knew that she wasn't regarded as much by Zheng. She hated the feeling as any woman would.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave a wry smile and said, "The fact that my corporeal body can enter the Other Shore can't be known by many people."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge became silent. She went on letting out the divine flames and was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>The flames hissed.</p>

  <p>Once the green powder was inside the Burning Crystals and under high temperature, it turned into fine green threads. These threads spread in all directions like blood vessels and erupted almost silently. The Burning Crystals cracked.</p>

  <p>Then, these Burning Crystals all became rice-sized crystals. The pot was eventually filled with clear colorful "rice". Zheng could even smell a calming scent of flowers.</p>

  <p>"It looks gorgeous," Feng Ge commented.</p>

  <p>She did not stop heating the pot. Eventually, the rice-sized crystals melted and turned into a translucent thick liquid. Finally, it was almost done.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly remembered something he had to do. He swiftly turned and walked towards the other side of the wooden hut. He pulled down the white cotton threads hanging on the wall, twisted them into wicks and put them into vessels of various lengths.</p>

  <p>Then he picked up the big pot and poured the liquid into the vessels.</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully and calmly did his task as if it wasn't his first time to do such work.</p>

  <p>If Feng Ge hadn't been stuck with Zheng, she would have thought that Zheng had been working here for a long time. He had the perfect skills, after all.</p>

  <p>"I figured out the method through the few items in this hut. Once the wax solidifies, then it's done," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"Can we try to light up the candles we made?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>"Let's try." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>In no time, the wax was already dried up and densely packed together, turning into white candles.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pointed at a candle, and a golden flame rushed towards it. However, no matter how many times the flame got in contact with the wick, the candle wouldn't light up.</p>

  <p>"There must be a specific way," Zheng said nonchalantly as though he had already expected the result.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge sighed. "So how can we leave?" she asked in a hesitating voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng rubbed his chin to think. "Maybe if we could finish the task in advance, the three-eyed boy would let us go," he said.</p>

  <p>No matter what they had to do, he couldn't let her take out the candles in her space ring within a short time. He didn't even bring up this option.</p>

  <p>After comforting Feng Ge, he put more Burning Crystals in the big pot and spread the green powder on them. She continued to heat them up.</p>

  <p>Then he held the vessels in his hand and pulled out the embedded candles one by one.</p>

  <p>They continued to work in harmony for at least ten hours. Soon after, they had more than forty candles.</p>

  <p>After using up all the Burning Crystals, Zheng and Feng Ge finally had the time to rest. They leaned on a wall of the wooden house, and rested as they waited for the three-eyed boy to return.</p>
