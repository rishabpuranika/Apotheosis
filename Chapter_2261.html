  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Gods Killing Sword Array was created by Joy herself, but the idea for the array had originally been provided by Mike.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Four Swords Change was the most original Gods Killing Sword Array, and even it still had many flaws.</p>

  <p>Later though, Joy became a Demi-holy Being, and the four swords array changed drastically. In terms of power alone, it became much stronger.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to shape the power to the Long Vine Sword, the Buddha Emperor Sword, the Grant Sun Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword because the four swords have different abilities. The Long Vine Sword focuses on the array of entangling the enemy; the Buddha Emperor Sword's main ability is the killing array; the Grant Sun Sword is mainly used for defensive array; and the Heavenly Tooth Sword forms the hunting array. In fact, the Thirty-two Swords Change and the Ninety-six Swords Change of the Gods Killing Sword Array have broken through these constraints, but now, you cannot master the Thirty-two Swords Change. And the Four Swords Change is based on these initial four swords..."</p>

  <p>The four swords each had their own single sword changes, and they respectively corresponded to entanglement, killing, defense, and hunting.</p>

  <p>When the two swords cooperated with each other, they could combine their arrays and create something even more powerful, like the entangling-killing array or the entangling-hunting array. Furthermore, there were also many changes, including the cooperation of three swords and four swords at the same time.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Luo Luo Zheng had to maintain these powerful swords in perfect balance, and on the other hand, he had to master their respective coordination. This was a great feat, even for Luo Luo Zheng, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, time was controllable in the Purple Sky Land, and with Joy's help, his understanding of the Gods Killing Sword Array increased little by little.</p>

  <p>In just a month's time, Luo Luo Zheng had already obtained a small achievement. He had mastered the change of a single sword. In other words, he could now make the most of any sword he laid his hands on.</p>

  <p>After three months, Luo Luo Zheng had mastered the use of two swords.</p>

  <p>Swordsmanship with double swords offered more mysterious changes and was generally better in both power and flexibility.</p>

  <p>Half a year later, Luo Luo Zheng had enabled the capacity of performing with three swords together. Using three swords at once was the Gods Killing Sword Array's essence, and notably, it was also considered a unique skill.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng an entire year to completely grasp the technique of using four swords together, all at once. This was the Gods Killing Sword Array's ultimate kill attack. This was more difficult to attain because he not only needed to understand the array, but the characteristic of the four swords, too.</p>

  <p>As Joy watched how quickly Luo Luo Zheng progressed, she felt calmer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's father was a very gifted man, which indicated that Luo Luo Zheng was destined to be special. Besides having inherited his father's amazing talent, he was equally bound to be even more terrifying than his father.</p>

  <p>Pondering things over, Joy knew deep inside herself that she had taught Luo Luo Zheng to be a horrifying guy.</p>

  <p>The genuine Gods Killing Sword Array could only be mastered by Demi-holy Beings, or even Holy Beings. That said though, Luo Luo Zheng, who was nothing more than a proving godly warrior, could perform it freely.</p>

  <p>Joy couldn't help but vaguely look forward to Luo Zheng's performance in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>One full year in the Purple Sky Land was the equivalence of six days in the divine land. In addition to the year it took Luo Luo Zheng to master the Gods Killing Sword Array, he had also spent three days shaping power before that. With the divine land's measurement of time, this whole process only took Luo Luo Zheng nine days.</p>

  <p>Joy left the Purple Sky Land with Luo Luo Zheng and went back to her palace.</p>

  <p>Upon their arrival, a middle-aged man had been waiting there for a long time. His name was Alfredo, the Han Clan master. Luo Luo Zheng had met him once before.</p>

  <p>Joy was very angry with Alfredo, and upon seeing him, she certainly wasn't pleased. Instead, she asked coldly, "What brings you here?"</p>

  <p>With a hint of helplessness on his face, Alfredo stated, "The Xie Clan has come to our land. We were wrong about this matter. I wonder how you're going to deal with the latter, being a Demi-holy Being?"</p>

  <p>What happened was that Sheridan was killed on the Han Clan's Floating Island, and the murderer was a Han Clan disciple with a different surname. Between the wealthy and influential clans, this sort of thing had to be explained. The Xie Clan thus sent people here to attend to this matter several times, but because of Joy, the Han Clan had been avoiding such.</p>

  <p>In a fit of rage, the Xie Clan chose to team up with both the Leng Clan and the Liu Clan in order to put pressure on the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Alfredo felt no scruples toward the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan. Both clans, ranked first and second from the bottom respectively, became two of the wealthiest and most influential clans just because they rode on other's coattails and had the possibility of being eliminated one day. Even wealthy and influential clans must have Holy Beings, and the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan were no exceptions. They did indeed have two Holy Beings, but not every family with a Holy Being was bound to be a wealthy and influential clan.</p>

  <p>The Leng Clan's sudden request took Alfredo by surprise.</p>

  <p>Considering the conflict between Han Liusu and Langston that day, he could only guess that that was the problem. Although he had been clear about it, he still wanted to throw the big problem at Joy.</p>

  <p>"How does it have anything to do with the Leng Clan when it's the Xie Clan that wants an explanation? Is the Leng Clan even qualified to comment on this?" Han Liusu replied in a cold tone of voice.</p>

  <p>It wasn't really a big deal, though. The Xie Clan had a lot of direct descendants, and Sheridan wasn't the best of them. Because this descendant had wanted to bring Luo Luo Zheng to his death, he brought about nothing more than his own humiliation when it was Luo Luo Zheng that killed him instead.</p>

  <p>The only remaining problem was Luo Zheng's identity. To the Han Clan, he was just an outsider.</p>

  <p>"You know that the ranking is very important to our Han Clan, and that the Leng Clan will help us. For this reason, the Holy Emperor has even agreed Han Liusu and Langston's marriage! I'm telling you this because I don't want this matter to affect our relationship with the Leng Clan."</p>

  <p>Han Liusu and Langston's marriage was only the beginning of an alliance between the two clans. It wasn't important in any way at all. Now though, a conflict involving these two clans arose. This was definitely not something Alfredo wanted to see.</p>

  <p>"As it stands right now, as long as we push that guy out, we can easily solve this problem," Alfredo said, casting an indifferent glance toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's crazy talk annoyed Alfredo, who was standing in front of him.</p>

  <p>Who cared if Luo Luo Zheng had showed extraordinary strength when he killed Sheridan and hurt Langston, right? The Han Clan wasn't lacking in masters, nor in talents. Offending the Leng Clan for something so futile as a mere outsider just wasn't worth it. The easiest way to appease their anger was to give them Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To Alfredo, Luo Luo Zheng was just a little grasshopper. So what if he was strong?</p>

  <p>He was still nothing more than a strong grasshopper and he felt no pity for sacrificing him. As a member of the high position, this was a rightful way of thinking.</p>

  <p>Even if Joy didn't know Luo Zheng's true identity, she would definitely protect him. Moreover, she knew that Luo Luo Zheng was Mike's son, so how could she possibly agree with Alfredo anyway?</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the Holy Emperor is doing. Seeing as you want to conceal the problem in the ranking so badly from me, then you can continue to conceal it. But I won't push Tianxing out. If the Leng Clan comes to question such, let them come to me. Didn't I make everything clear to you at the Spiritual Heart Hall the other day?" Joy uttered without emotion.</p>

  <p>This time, Alfredo didn't budge an inch. He replied stiffly, "Don't force me to go to the Holy Emperor."</p>

  <p>"You can ask him to question me. I'll give him the exact same answer and..." Joy continued, "Even without the Leng Clan's help, it's still possible our Han Clan to maintain our current rank."</p>

  <p>"With what? Your Purple Soul Hall?" Alfredo sneered.</p>

  <p>As far as Alfredo knew, Joy had mobilized female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall to make a breakthrough in their rankings and points in the Arena of Legends. Recently though, while those great clans were hard at work, the Purple Soul Hall's ranking hadn't risen, but instead had gone down. All the disciples' points had only risen a little.</p>

  <p>The ranking just clearly couldn't be improved by disciples' willpower alone. Their talent and strength needed to be considered as well.</p>

  <p>"Two months later, you'll see the results. Asking me to hand Tianxing over to them is wishful thinking and you know it. I don't want you to come to me for this matter again," said Joy coldly.</p>

  <p>Joy's firm words went hand in hand with her attitude, and Alfredo looked at Luo Luo Zheng with confusion.</p>

  <p>Joy had once protected Luo Luo Zheng, and Alfredo could understand. After all, there were very few talents in the Purple Soul Hall, so it was only normal that Joy didn't want to give up on the little guy. That said though, today, her performance had gone overboard.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that Tianxing Luo had a special background?</p>

  <p>A smart person like Alfredo could always guess at different possibilities.</p>

  <p>He knew how Joy had grown up? she didn't rely on the Han Clan's Holy Emperor because, at the time, the Purple Power Body wasn't highly valued in rich clans.</p>

  <p>In fact, Mike was the one who helped her become a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>'Tianxing's surname is also Luo. Is he one of Mike's descendants?' Alfredo wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>Joy's conjecture was confirmed by Han Liusu and Aleyna, but there was no evidence to confirm Alfredo's. In other words, he could only secretly make blind and disorderly estimates.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he wondered why Joy was so confident. Did she really have the ability to bring the Purple Soul Hall's points up to a higher level? If she could really manage such a thing, she'd have the possibility of keeping the ranking of the Han Clan's Floating Island, and even to become one or two places higher.</p>
