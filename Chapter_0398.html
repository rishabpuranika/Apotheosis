  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom!"</p>

  <p>In an incredibly fast, almost thunderous speed, the demonic phantoms? struck. After two rounds of being struck by three demonic phantoms, a defense song beside Dick?cracked and began to disintegrate before falling apart. With only five defense songs around him, he could survive only eight or nine rounds of attacks by the demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>And considering the demonic phantoms' attack speed, he realized all his defense songs would be broken within a few moments. And if all the demonic phantoms hit on his body, Dick strongly doubted if he could survive even one round of the brutal attack!</p>

  <p>At this time Dick was really?in a fix. He not only needed to write kill songs, but also defense songs. Dick was in possession of a magic pen, was extraordinarily brilliant in writing and also was a great master of cursive script. However, right now, he was too busy on writing the defense song and kill song to care about maintaining the attractive sleekness of his words. Instead, every word was written askew, and there was nothing to suggest that a master of cursive script had actually written them.</p>

  <p>In fact, Dick's hand was quivering violently even while writing. On any other day, he?wouldn't write with such a shaky and unstable hand. At this moment, except pushing his life vitality to the limit, he cared about nothing.</p>

  <p>Even though Dick?urged his life vitality to the limit on writing, it couldn't keep up with the loss of the songs. The number of kill songs in the Thirteen Kills Array?over there?steadily dwindled, and so did the number of defense songs?over here...</p>

  <p>"One last defense song!"</p>

  <p>A single defense song could only withstand two rounds of attack coming from the demonic phantoms. And owing to the increasing attack speed of the demonic phantoms, a defense song could be broken even in a breath's time. The demonic phantoms' power could never be estimated.</p>

  <p>Dick who?was always calm, composed and gentle was now in a mess.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth as a sense of anxiety gripped him.</p>

  <p>A while ago, he had made full preparation for the All Peaks Competition while also learning a powerful method. But this was his trump card which he planed to use when fighting those personal disciples.</p>

  <p>The sooner he revealed his trump card, the less likely he was able to win the battle over.</p>

  <p>Once his unique skill was exposed, he would inevitably attract the personal disciples' attentions, who would then consequently figure out the corresponding attack, which was why Dick hesitated with his move.</p>

  <p>'To yield?' murmured Dick in a tone laced with defeat.</p>

  <p>To yield was just to put an end to his winning streak but he would still be left with a chance to return again.</p>

  <p>But Dick rejected the idea instinctively and almost immediately. By the gentleman's doctrines he practised, he was absolutely not allowed to yield. With a truly upright vitality, he would not make a detour because of the hard and steep way; he would not retreat because of the times were dangerous. If he gave up and yielded at this moment, he would regret it for the rest of his life, and would never be able to forgive himself. Then how was he able to practice?the gentleman's doctrines?</p>

  <p>Alas...</p>

  <p>"I never expect to be forced to play?my trump card in the group stage," sighed Dick with disappointment.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the breath inside Dick's body exploded, even that sigh brought an increased oppression to the people. And then a great spirit? erupted out of his body baffling everyone around the field.</p>

  <p>Dick?sent another?defense song as he began to write up in the mid-air with his writing brush.</p>

  <p>However, Dick?was not writing a single word, but a sentence in that rushed moment. If there were a learned man, he would indeed recognize what he wrote.</p>

  <p>"In the world there is the spirit of righteousness, taking many forms, bestowed on the everchanging things. Below they are the rivers and mountains; above they are the sun and stars. With people, it is called the spirit of honor and fearlessness, so vast it fills the universe. When the empire is tranquil, one pours forth harmony in the splendid court...." (The Song of the Spirit of Righteousness, written by Wen Tian-xiang of the Song Dynasty, translated by Feng Xin-ming 2008)</p>

  <p>"It is the Righteousness Song! Dick is writing the Righteousness Song."</p>

  <p>"Awe-inspiring righteousness in the Righteousness Song. It is absolutely unbelievable that Dick has devoted himself to practicing the morally guiding righteousness very sincerely. The righteousness is a kind of intent, similar to sword, blade and martial art intents, which is more illusory and mystery than them, and more elusive to understand from meditation. I didn't think he really understood all of what it meant!"</p>

  <p>"The battle is getting more and more exciting as it is picking up pace.</p>

  <p>Come on, Dick, beat Zheng. I am all set on you!"</p>

  <p>Because Zheng?was prevailing after he called out the demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>Everybody was extremely?disappointed. As things stood still, Dick? might not escape the inevitable outcome after all. He might even lose the fight.</p>

  <p>But what was not expected was that with?the last defense song, he would write a?Righteousness Song!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng?concentrated on manipulating the?demonic phantoms to break Dick's defense song, but just at the moment, he sensed a tremendous power and influence radiating from Dick!</p>

  <p>This power was not sharp, but it was very thick, as if in possession of a collection of the general trend of the world. And it pressed over towards?</p>

  <p>Zheng. For a second, Zheng's six demonic phantoms?were shaken up and Zheng's control over them also got slower.</p>

  <p>"The Righteousness Song?" Zheng's pupil shrank slightly as his expression grew grim but dignified.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, the strength of any of the top 100 disciples on Cloud Sect chart could not be underestimated by anyone! 'But it's all right. Let me have a good and fair fight with you!' shrugged Zheng. Even in the face of righteousness's overwhelming force, Zheng did not reflect an ounce of fear.</p>

  <p>Instead, there was a flickering and bright light lighting up in his eyes, and a turbulent energy emanating from his body.</p>
