<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily, Timotheus, and the others frowned when they heard the news.</p>

  <p>It was very troublesome for all of them.</p>

  <p>But it was relatively better than they initially expected.</p>

  <p>At the very least, the Warden race was also restricted by the Strength Equalizing Theurgy. They wouldn't be able to go beyond their limits without the grace of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>If the Strength Equalizing Theurgy didn't work on the Warden race, then all of them might end up being slaughtered by the race without any room to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Since they have the grace of the Chaos Ancient God, does that mean you and Luther can obtain it as well?" Luo Zheng asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "Hypothetically yes, but the place where we can obtain the grace isn't here. We have to go to the foot of the Pray Tablet, but it's difficult to get close to it because it is in the deepest part of our base."</p>

  <p>"Either way, we would still have to give it a shot," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "We're on the way there. If we get the chance to approach the Pray Tablet, I'll pray to the Chaos Ancient God for his grace."</p>

  <p>At the core of their base.</p>

  <p>A bunch of Life Lamps emitted steady lights around the huge disc.</p>

  <p>Many powerful practitioners preferred not to make the Life Lamps because the Life Lamps had the tendency to expose some flaws.</p>

  <p>However, under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, these flaws didn't exist anymore.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Warden race had already prepared their Life Lamps and arranged them accordingly around the disc.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>One of the Life Lamps suddenly made a faint sound. The bean sized flame in the middle of the lamp dimmed as it shook a few times before finally going out.</p>

  <p>"Did Sandy's Life Lamp just go out?"</p>

  <p>"Who could've possible killed her?"</p>

  <p>"She was always very cautious. For some reason, she was unable to escape safely. Those people..."</p>

  <p>Most of the members of the Warden race were gathered on the open space on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>At the front of the open space were about seven or eight people sitting cross legged on the stairs. At the top of the stairs was a member of the Warden race. He was the old man who rotated the round disc to activate the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Staring at the fading Life Lamp, the old man couldn't help but feel a bit sad.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the clansmen who were discussing, the old man said,</p>

  <p>"The opponents are quite stronger than we imagined."</p>

  <p>"Stronger? No matter how strong they really are, they are still a group of mortals. How can they be so frightening?"</p>

  <p>A man in a black robe stood up from the crowd.</p>

  <p>Although he was covered in a black robe, he was obviously a tall and strong man just by looking at his body and listening to his voice.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of? Send us to fight! We are not afraid of the Snake Goddess race and we will fight them to the death if we have to," a second man in a black robe added.</p>

  <p id="top_20">The old man still hesitated.</p>

  <p>He didn't think that the people being led by Spark could be so weak.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he attributed the matter to Emily and sent Sandy. He was planning to eliminate the Snake Goddess race and wipe out the exiles from the other big races.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that this plan was already bound to fail.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to the grace of our master, we can kill those people with ease as if we are merely killing chickens and dogs!" A third man in a black robe stood up.</p>

  <p>Many clansmen began to shout at the same time.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the old man finally made up his mind.</p>

  <p>"You are right. We shouldn't fear them at all." The old man slowly stood up. "Now that they have entered our city, we have no other choice. All of us have been blessed by the grace of our master and we owe it all to him.</p>

  <p>We cannot fail him. We must win this battle no matter what."</p>

  <p>The old man's words were received by the crowd with a huge round of applause.</p>

  <p>"Arvin!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Bonnie!"</p>

  <p>"Here, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Bergen!"</p>

  <p>"At your service, sir!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>The old man made arrangements as planned.</p>

  <p>Almost half of the people left immediately.</p>

  <p>The old man then said to the black robed man with purple hair who was standing on the stairs, "Come with me. We shall go to see the tomb keeper."</p>

  <p>When he heard those words, the black robed man with purple hair trembled slightly and asked, "Why do we need to see him?"</p>

  <p>"Just in case," the old man replied.</p>

  <p>The black robed man with purple hair seemed very reluctant as he firmly said, "We won't fail in this battle!"</p>

  <p>"What will happen if we do?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>The black robed man with purple hair couldn't say anything so he simply nodded instead.</p>

  <p>The old man then came down from the steps and walked in another direction with the black robed man with purple hair.</p>

  <p>After passing through an empty area, they were greeted by a low mountain. At the back of the mountain were some tombstones.</p>

  <p>The Warden race couldn't discover the secrets to an eternal life. In other words, their master refused to give them the gift of eternal life.</p>

  <p>Thousands of clansmen had been buried under those tombstones.</p>

  <p>Some of the tombstones were so old that the words written on them could no longer be read.</p>

  <p>The old man was far from being young as well. After four loops of reincarnation, which could be four thousand years later, he would also take his eternal slumber in this place.</p>

  <p>Every time he passed by the cemetery, the old man couldn't help but take deep breaths and think about what was ahead of him.</p>

  <p>After passing the tombstones, they finally reached the foot of the mountain behind.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the mountain was a tombstone that was a hundred feet high. The tombstone was empty. No one knew exactly why it was there, nor did they know who was buried under it.</p>

  <p>A dirty young man was lying in front of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>The young man had been living underneath the tombstone for countless years, yet his image had never changed. His personality was rather odd and he liked talking nonsense. He also rarely communicated with the Warden race.</p>

  <p>In the past, the people of the Warden race found trouble with the young man. They once gathered over a hundred members to surround him.</p>

  <p>But the power of the young man made them realize that they could not provoke him no matter how hard they tried. He was way stronger than any exile in this world.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, he was not bloodthirsty at all. He only taught them a valuable lesson during the conflict and then immediately let them go.</p>

  <p>Since then, no one from the Warden race ever dared to provoke him again.</p>

  <p>The Warden race had a lot of speculations about the person's real identity but they never reached a clear conclusion.</p>

  <p>Actually, he wasn't really a tomb keeper but since he had been staying in front of the tombstone for so long, the Warden race decided to call him that way.</p>

  <p>In the old man's mind, there must be a reason why their master brought the man there.</p>

  <p>Now that the Warden race had reached its most critical moment, the old man hoped that he would be willing to give them the support they needed.</p>

  <p>The old man and the black-robed man with purple hair walked towards the foot of the tombstone but they didn't see the young man right away.</p>

  <p>As the two of them scratched their heads in confusion, they saw the young man sitting on top of the tombstone. He was looking down at them as he chuckled and said, "You have used the Strength Equalizing Theurgy of the old monster. It seems that you are in a lot of trouble."</p>
