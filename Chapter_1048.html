<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Hanson quickly nodded and said, "The ancient jades were left behind by my ancestor."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also anxious and naturally impatient as the fellow in front of him wasn't giving him a straight answer.</p>

  <p>"So, I don't know where exactly the ancient jades came from..." Hanson repeated.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, a murderous look took over Zheng's face. He stared at Hanson and said coldly, "You're playing a trick on me!"</p>

  <p>Hanson was stunned to find himself suddenly enveloped in Zheng's killing intent. His face turned deathly pale and his legs went weak. Unexpectedly, he knelt on the ground. "I don't dare fool you. Please let me finish what I'm going to say first!"</p>

  <p>"Speak!" commanded Luo Zheng tersely.</p>

  <p>"The ancient jades have indeed been left behind by my ancestors. However, our Li Clan saved someone seven hundred years ago. That person... He is a master from one of the four great divine kingdoms!" Hanson quickly added,</p>

  <p>"Our Li Clan was able to develop and become more powerful because of him! Although my ancestors haven't told me about the history of the ancient jades, I'm assuming they might have been left behind by him."</p>

  <p>"They came from the four divine kingdoms!" Luo Zheng suddenly raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>There was some truth in Hanson's conjecture. He had never heard of the ancient jades in the Central Region but they contained miraculous life force.</p>

  <p>If the ancient jades came from the Central Region, other members of the region would have found them long ago as they were very powerful.</p>

  <p>Irrespective of that, Luo Zheng had finally found a clue. The life force contained in these ancient jades was not enough to wake Ning Yudie up, so he had to make a trip to the four divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was lost in thought, he saw Hanson looking at him eagerly. He naturally understood what he was thinking, so he said, "Follow me."</p>

  <p>Hanson was overjoyed. He followed closely behind Luo Zheng and they went straight to the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the World Commercial Alliance was still solemn.</p>

  <p>Despite Zheng's promise of single-handedly dealing with the Soul Sea Realm masters of the York Divine Kingdom, Dillon and the others were still preparing for the battle.</p>

  <p>But no matter how much the World Commercial Alliance members, who were highly intelligent, tried, they still couldn't come up with an effective strategy for the war.</p>

  <p>The Central Region and the four great divine kingdoms were on completely different levels. Up until now, the Central Region never had a sacred place in its true sense, and the four great divine kingdoms had a long history with quite a few Soul Sea Realm warriors. Thus it was possible that the four great divine kingdoms might be stronger than the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Even Eddie, who was at the Life and Death Realm, almost destroyed the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance. In the end, it was Luo Zheng who managed to turn the tables. In this case, they would surely be no match for the Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>The members of the World Commercial Alliance had a huge disagreement on this matter.</p>

  <p>Dillon was inclined to trust Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although this trust was somewhat blind, Dillon believed that since Luo Zheng had given his word, he naturally had his own ways of dealing with the situation.</p>

  <p>As for Hobbes, Haber and the rest of the elders, they didn't want to pin all their hopes on Luo Zheng. Hobbes believed that the York Divine Kingdom's target wasn't the Central Region, but Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>What Master Wallace had said via the mirror made one thing clear. He knew that there was a huge secret hidden in Zheng's body and that was what attracted the masters of the York Divine Kingdom to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>In fact, before Zheng's appearance, the four divine kingdoms had never shown any interest in the Sky Northern Region in all these years.</p>

  <p>Since this was Zheng's problem, there was no need for the World Commercial Alliance to take the fall for him.</p>

  <p>It was not that the members of the World Commercial Alliance were ungrateful. But survival was a natural instinct. Luo Zheng had killed Eddie this time, which was indeed a big relief to the World Commercial Alliance, but it had nothing to do with the current situation. If they felt that they couldn't defeat a strong opponent, they would definitely find a way to escape.</p>

  <p>Just as they were debating on the matter, someone arrived in the meeting hall and announced, "Luo Zheng wants to meet you all!"</p>

  <p>Dillon nodded and said, "Invite him in quickly!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng brought Hanson into the meeting room. When Dillon saw the beggar behind Luo Zheng, he was slightly surprised. "Luo Zheng, he is..." Now, Zheng's strength was no less than anyone else's in the Central Region. The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance regarded Luo Zheng as their peer.</p>

  <p>"You should give the thousand supreme life vitality crystals to this man,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said to the members of the World Commercial Alliance, with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the three obese men were shocked. The one thousand supreme life vitality crystals were a reward for Yudie's treatment. Since Luo Zheng was asking them to give it away to this man, could it be...</p>

  <p>"Has Ning Yudie been rescued by him?" Dillon asked, glancing at the ordinary-looking man behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the last few days, besides plotting against the York Divine Kingdom, the World Commercial Alliance members were trying their best to help Luo Zheng screen extraordinary people and find the best one, which was the most important task for the time being.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of extraordinary people, and a majority of these people were swindlers, but in order to save Ning Yudie, they would hold on to any ray of hope however small it might be.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors in the World Commercial Alliance, but only a few hundred warriors had the expertise to screen extraordinary people and identify the best one. Many elders were also enlisted for this task.</p>

  <p>They were surprised and wondered whether Luo Zheng had figured out a way to save Ning Yudie before they could.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shook his head and said with a smile, "Yes and no...to some extent."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Luo Zheng?" asked Hobbes immediately.</p>

  <p>Seeing the puzzled expressions of the crowd, Luo Zheng told them that Hanson had given him several ancient jades. The others understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>"So do you plan to go to the divine kingdoms, Luo Zheng?" Dillon, however, could guess what Luo Zheng was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded without the slightest hesitation. "After I deal with those guys, I will go to the divine kingdoms to find the ancient jades!"</p>

  <p>Dealing with those fellows...</p>

  <p>Everyone was surprised. Luo Zheng was indeed arrogant and confident! It was not easy to deal with the Soul Sea Realm masters of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had never let anyone down so far!</p>

  <p>But why was he so confident?</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Luo Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>Hobbes, who had a quick temper, couldn't help but yell, "Luo Zheng! What is your plan? Can you tell us first?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, we are indeed curious. Do you really have the strength to defeat the Soul Sea Realm masters?" Haber, who seldom spoke, also piped in.</p>

  <p>Dillon smiled faintly. Their doubts were reasonable. No matter how powerful Zheng's trump card was, he would never be a match for a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>This was a mystery no one could figure out. What was more, it was a mystery that would affect everyone� it was a matter of life and death. It would be unreasonable on Zheng's part to hide it from others!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled wryly, but didn't keep them in suspense any longer. He said directly, "It's very simple! Indeed, I do not have the strength to fight a Soul Sea Realm master, but since the York Divine Kingdom will send their Soul Sea Realm masters here, we can also ask our Soul Sea Realm masters to fight them!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Everyone in the meeting hall was shocked.</p>

  <p>Soul Sea Realm masters? The Central Region didn't have any such powerful masters.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you joking?" asked an elder of the World Commercial Alliance, shaking his head. He did not believe Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>"I am not joking," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at each other in confusion, but they felt that Luo Zheng was being illogical. Hobbes questioned him, "If you have the help of the Soul Sea Realm masters, why didn't they show up to help you when you were fighting with Eddie?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was almost killed by Eddie in the battle against the Heavenly Evil Sect, and Ning Yudie had been unable to wake up because of Eddie.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. "Because Eddie is someone I must kill on my own! In order to stabilize my warrior spirit, I must personally kill Eddie! This is my test and also the first step towards conquering the whole universe!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words reverberated throughout the room as an Mu Ning of majesty erupted from him. This was his domineering demeanor.</p>

  <p>His domineering Mu Ning was completely different from that of Eddie whose Mu Ning was extremely crass and imperious. Eddie couldn't be bothered to reason with anyone and would suppress all those who opposed him. But Luo Zheng had an impressive Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that he would actually risk his life to fight Eddie in order to reinforce his warrior spirit! He clearly had a safer option, but he was willing to risk his life and chose the most difficult path. And he would do so bravely.</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent for a long time.</p>

  <p>Finally Dillon asked, "Well, may I know where the Soul Sea Realm masters you mentioned are?"</p>
