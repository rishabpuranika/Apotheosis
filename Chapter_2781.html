  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nicholas didn't reply to the woman. He just sneered and attacked.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>A black claw print shot out of his hand, penetrating the space between him and the woman.</p>

  <p>The claw print seemed ordinary, but the power contained in it was extremely terrible. Any opponent, even a Holy Being, would have to go all out to defend against it, let alone counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, the woman just raised her eyebrows lightly.</p>

  <p>With a flick of her finger, another white light as thick as an arm fell from the sky and collided with the black claw print.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The two forces collided with a muffled sound and then disappeared quickly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas immediately furrowed his eyebrows, but the woman just smiled.</p>

  <p>She didn't take him seriously at all.</p>

  <p>Just now, Clark had been at a disadvantage when fighting with the woman, so Nicholas hadn't wanted to let down his guard in this fight.</p>

  <p>He had known that he couldn't hurt this woman seriously, but he had to save face, so when he had attacked her, he had used almost all of his strength.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she had easily avoided his attack. Her strength was beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had launched a surprise attack, the woman did not seem to be irritated.</p>

  <p>The smile on her face was still warm, and she said softly, "It's not time to fight yet. Let's get back to the topic just now. Aren't you looking for the supreme treasure of belief to control the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." There was a strange expression in Nicholas's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have it," the woman said coyly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Holy Beings present were taken aback.</p>

  <p>Was this woman so powerful because she was in possession of the supreme treasure of belief that they wanted?</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes burned with desire, especially those of the consummate True Gods. If they managed to obtain the supreme treasure of belief, their strength and status would instantly be on a par with Nicholas's, and might even surpass his.</p>

  <p>"If you are willing to hand over the supreme treasure of belief, we can cooperate," said Nicholas, casting a deep, significant glance at the woman.</p>

  <p>"I will satisfy you as much as I can in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Really?" the woman asked, her face revealing a trace of expectation.</p>

  <p>Seeing her expression, Nicholas felt happy for the first time after he met her. He didn't know where this woman was from, but he had a bad feeling about her. But with his status and influence, maybe he could really convince her to hand over the supreme treasure of belief to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have my word." Nicholas nodded cautiously. "I am the most excellent one among all the Holy Beings. I'm afraid if I can't do something, no one can!"</p>

  <p>"All right, help me wipe out all the divine citizens and all the True Gods in the divine land." The woman's eyes were full of ruthlessness and ferocity.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>"She wants to kill all the divine citizens in the divine land? Is she crazy?"</p>

  <p>"It is normal for a mad woman to say something like that, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>After hearing the woman's request, many people began to whisper.</p>

  <p>What she had asked for was too much! They would never do it even if they could.</p>

  <p>Sure, the alliance of the wealthy clans wanted to dominate the divine land, but they were still members of the divine land. No matter how crazy they were, they would never do such a thing.</p>

  <p>However, the woman had said those words in a completely serious tone.</p>

  <p>There was no chance that she had just been joking.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's face froze. "I wonder what kind of feud you have with the divine citizens in the divine land," he said helplessly.</p>

  <p id="top_29">There was a wide range of divine citizens, including True Gods and Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Did this mean that the woman had enmity with all the people of the divine land?</p>

  <p>"Because you don't deserve this world. You don't have the right..." The woman stopped herself before she finished. Then she changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"There's no point in talking anymore. The supreme treasure of belief is in my ice palace. If you want to take it, you'll have to go and get it. Let's see if you have the strength and luck."</p>

  <p>With that, she rose from her throne of ice crystals, which shattered into pieces and turned into ice dregs as if on cue. Then, she stepped on these ice dregs and slowly opened the gate of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>Before entering the ice palace, she suddenly said, "But you have no other choice!"</p>

  <p>Then, she disappeared inside the ice palace.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The huge cloud above the Abyss Demon Region began spinning even more rapidly.</p>

  <p>The black fog had already completely enveloped the sixth and seventh stages of the Abyss Demon Region. The entire region seemed to have fallen into eternal night.</p>

  <p>Just then, a flame appeared on the wound on Clark's right shoulder.</p>

  <p>As the flame continued to condense, it faintly turned into an arm.</p>

  <p>While he was healing himself, he kept cursing the woman.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go in?" Murphy asked Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded. "There is no other way. Of course we have to go in."</p>

  <p>Then, he led the group toward the entrance of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>Although everyone knew that they had no choice but to follow Nicholas, most of them were pulling long faces.</p>

  <p>Who knew what exactly they would find in the ice palace?</p>

  <p>The strength that the woman showed had been enough to frighten everyone.</p>

  <p>And now, they were entering her lair. They could only imagine the danger they were about to face.</p>

  <p>Samuel was the only one who was as calm as usual.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Most of the black water in the vast Sea of Meditation had been drawn out.</p>

  <p>There was a big bubble floating on the surface of the black water. Sword Chen stood above this bubble, watching the strange movement in the sky.</p>

  <p>'How could this be?</p>

  <p>Half of the water in the Sea of Meditation has been drawn out. Does it have anything to do with Luo Zheng?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had helped Luo Zheng use the force of primitive fear in the Sea of Meditation, but they had been targeted by the Devils from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>At first, Sword Chen had thought that it was a coincidence, but later, he had realized that they had been aiming for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of unknown creatures in the Sea of Meditation, but most of them were not that powerful or intelligent. With the protection of the Scorching Gold, they didn't have to be afraid of the unknown creatures. The Devils, however, were a different matter. Whoever encountered them would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>However, the Devils were few and far between. Sword Chen had been wandering around in the Sea of Meditation for so many years, but he had seen them only a few times.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng had encountered a group of Devils almost as soon as he had entered the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>What a coincidence it was! Luo Zheng was really unlucky.</p>

  <p>'Maybe Luo Zheng's blood attracts the attention of the unknown creatures. Wait, that can't be. What does Luo Zheng's blood have to do with the Abyss Demon Region?'</p>

  <p>A myriad of thoughts had crowded Sword Chen's mind when he swam to the bottom of the sea to look for Luo Zheng repeatedly, but he couldn't find him.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really died in the Sea of Meditation, what should he do?</p>

  <p>Looking at the madly rotating whirlpool in the distance, he gritted his teeth and finally made up his mind. With a light step on the bubble beneath his feet, he flew toward the center of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>
