<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Kneeling down at the door of the Cloud Hall, it was no other than the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly to Liusu. Beaming an awkward smile, his face couldn't hide a faint embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression caught both Liusu and Nelly by surprise.</p>

  <p>Raising her head, the Evil God grew excited at the sight of Zheng. "I have never begged anyone in my life except for you! Please keep your promise!" he told Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng indeed promised the Evil God he would be released from the inner world.</p>

  <p>However, he had been quite busy ever since he entered the divine land. Not having had the time to stop even for a while, he had no time to fulfill his promise.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Evil God on his knee made Zheng feel guilty.</p>

  <p>Without thinking twice, Zheng approached him, clasping the Evil God's shoulders to help him up. However, the Evil God remained unmoved, with no intention to stand up. "I'm not going anywhere until you keep your promise!"</p>

  <p>"As I mentioned before, you already have my word, but now is not a good time," Zheng explained helplessly.</p>

  <p>"You can fulfill it at any time!" the Evil God insisted, hoping Zheng would agree to his demand.</p>

  <p>Even as a child, he had always been very ambitious. He had always seen difficulties as challenges he could solve with his own talent and perseverance. However, leaving this world was something he couldn't overcome.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, he thought Zheng was just giving him another excuse to prolong his time spent there.</p>

  <p>Laughing, Zheng replied, "I am currently in the chaos. With your current cultivation base, you will definitely die if you come with me."</p>

  <p>In reality though, Emily had means to allow the True Gods to come safely to the chaos.</p>

  <p>There was a time when they were outside the divine land, and Tianming and Sword Chen could move freely, thanks to Emily's protection.</p>

  <p>But releasing the Evil God now would be meaningless. He could only move on the flying ship, and Zheng couldn't throw him into the space channel to drift.</p>

  <p>Watching Zheng's expression, the Evil God realized that he was telling the truth. Disappointment started to cloud his eyes.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Zheng continued, "I'm going to a bigger world. I'll set you free when I get there."</p>

  <p>Expressionless, the Evil God stared at Zheng. After all, Zheng had fooled him several times in the past.</p>

  <p>He had already dominated the entire world when he was young. At the same time, he helped Zheng maintain the development of the world. Now his progeny had extended to many generations, but he was still stuck in this world.</p>

  <p>"Can you promise me really?" the Evil God asked, a glimmer of slyness flashing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was so clever to already guess the identities of Nelly and Liusu. He thought that if he could get Zheng to make a promise in front of his wives, he would need to keep his words.</p>

  <p>"Okay. I will set you free as soon as I arrive in that grander world," Zheng agreed, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>"If you don't keep your promise, I will kneel here again." the Evil God threatened.</p>

  <p>He had no idea why Zheng had moved his family to the floating island, but he was willing to see this. At least it meant that he had the chance to find Zheng here.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded helplessly, his eyes fixed on the Evil God. All of a sudden, he uttered in a surprised tone, "Gee…How many Godly Ways have you cultivated?"</p>

  <p>After absorbing the three thousand Godly Ways with the Infinity Ruler, Zheng had completed three thousand Godly Ways within his Godly Tile, which the Evil God could cultivate.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, the beginning of the martial artists in this world was as same as that in the divine land. However, Zheng's inner world couldn't compare with the divine land created by Chiyou. After all, the people in the divine land could easily reach the Soul Sea Realm when they were born.</p>

  <p>"How many Godly Ways? Let me see. There are only three thousand Godly Ways in this world. Of course, I've cultivated all three thousand Godly Ways," the Evil God replied confidently, looking at Zheng with a strange expression.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand Godly Ways..."</p>

  <p>His answer shocked both Liusu and Nelly.</p>

  <p>Liusu was a consummate True God, while Nelly was a powerful martial artist too. Coming from big clans, they both knew how awesome it was to cultivate several Godly Ways at the same time.</p>

  <p>Even more, if it would be all three thousand Godly Ways!</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Emperors and the Demi-holy Beings of the Mu Clan and the Han Clan couldn't make it. So how could he?</p>

  <p>His words also left Zheng dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only able to contain these three thousand Godly Ways by taking advantage of the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Although he might be able to achieve with constant practice and with his own talent, he knew it would take him a long period of time.</p>

  <p>Although the time flow rate in Zheng's inner world was very fast, the time for the Evil God to cultivate all three thousand Godly Ways didn't exceed ten years.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had managed to comprehend all three thousand Godly Ways these past ten years depending on his own talent.</p>

  <p>With such a great talent, even Zheng felt terrified.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God didn't realize how terrifying his talent was. He was made to believe that no one could compete with him in this world. His fame never dimmed since then. So what he wanted was to go and explore the greater world outside.</p>

  <p>Only in the outside world could he find someone that was on par with him.</p>

  <p>Regardless if it was in the divine land or even in the Source World, only a few genuine True Gods could cultivate so many Godly Ways. But that was something the Evil God didn't know about.</p>

  <p>Zheng was sure that there was no such talent in the divine land. However, he wasn't sure if the Source World had such talent to achieve it in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"However, since this world suppresses my power, I am not able to reach consummation of my three thousand Godly Ways. I can't cultivate the consummate level theurgies." The Evil God's face showed great disappointment.</p>

  <p>When Zheng became a consummate True God, the Evil God became a mid-rank True God, and as Zheng stepped into the Sea of Truth, the Evil God immediately became a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God could become a consummate True God only after Zheng broke through to the Other Shore Realm. This was a limitation of the Grand World Cultivation Method that he could not violate.</p>

  <p>After all, the appearance of a consummate True God in Zheng's inner world might threaten the safety of his inner world. Therefore, the strongest creature in the inner world were two levels lower than the one who created the world.</p>

  <p>After the universe of a Holy Being became the Rebirth Land, the entire inner world had become even larger. It allowed the living beings within the universe to cultivate into becoming the Supreme Lords, who were more powerful than the world lords but weaker than the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God's statement, Zheng wondered how strong he could be if he would let him cultivate in the Source World freely. Would he be able to integrate the three thousand Godly Ways?</p>

  <p>"Have you tried integrating the internal momentum of the Godly Ways when you practiced the three thousand Godly Ways?" Zheng asked out of the blue.</p>

  <p>With a strange expression, the Evil God looked at Zheng and replied, "These Godly Ways are supposed to be integrated, aren't they? I have observed how you have repeatedly merged the internal momentum several times. Now I have already integrated two thousand nine hundred and ninety-four of the three thousand Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>His answer left Zheng completely astonished. Staring blankly at the Evil God, he couldn't seem to find the words to respond.</p>
