  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Space Law was ineffective in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed aware of it, but no one was able to explain the reason behind it.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if they were Demi-holy Beings or Holy Beings. Nobody could use the Grand Teleportation technique in this place.</p>

  <p>Looking at the space channel, they wondered how it was even created.</p>

  <p>Without thinking twice, Nicholas rushed into the space channel first.</p>

  <p>Following him, the other Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods also went into it one after the other.</p>

  <p>The members of the Han Clan ended up being the last ones to enter.</p>

  <p>'I never expected that this young man from the Dongfang Clan would also find this shortcut. Anyway, if they want to take this path, I'm afraid they will have to pay a bigger price!' Samuel thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Tianming was not the first one to discover this shortcut.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, Samuel had used the same shortcut to escape from the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>It would be safe to assume that among all the Holy Beings in the divine land, Samuel probably knew the ways around the Abyss Demon Region the most.</p>

  <p>Looking at the others, he ordered flatly, "Let's go inside."</p>

  <p>Floating behind him, Pascal, Liusu and Aleyna reflected indifference on their faces.</p>

  <p>Alfredo, the leader of the Han Clan, decided to stay on the Floating Island instead of joining them in the trip to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The three responded in unison.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Turning into four beams of light, they flew straight into the space channel.</p>

  <p>The group of over one hundred powerful warriors flew all the way through the long space channel.</p>

  <p>Being built in a very peculiar way, strange lights flickered around the long channel, as different colors were carried out by the shadows.</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Beings could not decipher the power resonated inside this channel.</p>

  <p>"If the Space Law can't be employed in the Abyss Demon Region, then how did this space channel come into being?" Zeke, the Holy Being of the Fang Clan, asked with much curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The great fiends are very intelligent. Lurking in the depths of this forbidden land for so many years, they always end up coming up with these unimaginable methods," Jeremiah replied.</p>

  <p>Deeply immersed in the internal momentum of the space channel, Murphy suddenly spoke his mind, "Is it possible that some fiends have reached the Other Shore Realm?"</p>

  <p>Tracing back to his old memories, Murphy could still clearly remember how Emily built the space channel.</p>

  <p>Her actions penetrated through the Murphy Universe with unimaginable power. Murphy was almost omnipotent inside his own universe, and yet he could do nothing to the space channel.</p>

  <p>Hearing Murphy's question, Nicholas smiled faintly and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Realm? It's not that easy. If that's the case, I will definitely not ask you to follow me into the Abyss Demon Region. No matter how powerful and intelligent the great fiends are, they are still creatures in this forbidden land only. They are born with huge limitations, so it's impossible for them to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Murphy, are you frightened by the Other Shore Realm warriors coming from outside the divine land?"</p>

  <p>All creatures in the forbidden land were only illusions, essentially the same as the divine might coins, and were created by the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The fear in the hearts of the divine citizens constantly appeared in more and more complicated forms.</p>

  <p>Over the countless years, they had imagined all sorts of creatures related to bloodiness, strength, intelligence and cruelty, which was how the fiends were created.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, such creatures were even more perfect than the Holy Beings of the divine land. However, no matter how powerful they were, that did not change the fact that they were only illusions stuck in the forbidden land. If they decided to leave, they would disappear without a trace.</p>

  <p>The only exception was probably Edmond's appearance in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>With Edmond appearing as an incarnation of fear, they considered it a very rare case.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's true. The group of Other Shore Realm warriors that came with Zheng is a big hidden trouble for us all," Murphy admitted automatically.</p>

  <p>Many other Holy Beings who heard him also darkened their faces.</p>

  <p>Thinking that those Other Shore Realm warriors were like swords hanging above their heads, they worried they might fall and take their lives in a few years or decades.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Master Hamish will find a way out," said Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, if I manage to control the Abyss Demon Region this time, we might have the ability to win against them!"</p>

  <p>Tianming, who was not far away, quietly listened and was surprised with how the conversations of the Holy Beings were going.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that Zheng would bring a group of Other Shore Realm masters back to the divine land.</p>

  <p>But it sounded that even the Holy Beings felt threatened and terrified by this fact.</p>

  <p>Although he was greatly surprised, he tried to keep an emotionless facade.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Tianming found this a very good news, and highly advantageous.</p>

  <p>In the past, Tianming had always been willing to sacrifice his life to fulfill Mike's plan.</p>

  <p>However, one's state of mind could always change as time went by. After going through so many things, he became more and more reluctant to leave this world and began to doubt his mission.</p>

  <p>'If the Other Shore Realm masters take actions, there's a chance they can change my predetermined fate.' With that in mind, a small hope started to grow in his heart.</p>

  <p>Six hours later, they had travelled the entire space channel.</p>

  <p>And in a few more seconds, they reached the end of the channel.</p>

  <p>The moment they stepped out, they were engulfed in a thick purple mist.</p>

  <p>The mist was so dense that one could hardly see anything within a hundred feet radius.</p>

  <p>Feeling puzzled, Nicholas couldn't help asking, "Lowell, where are we?"</p>

  <p>Looking around, a cautious look appeared on Tianming's face. "I don't recall seeing a purple mist when I passed through this channel last time."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to be a mist," Murphy commented. Stretching out his hand, he was able to actually grasp the 'mist' in his hand. 'Strange, ' he thought. Loosening his grip, he felt the mist slide down his hand like a handful of sand.</p>

  <p>"They are a bunch of small bugs!" A consummate True God exclaimed, staring at the 'mist.'</p>

  <p>Hearing his conclusion, the rest also stared at the mist and observed.</p>

  <p>And he was right!</p>

  <p>What initially appeared as a dense purple mist was actually a group of very small bugs. These bugs were much smaller than the grains of sand, and they looked like a mist when they gathered together.</p>

  <p>"How disgusting! Let me burn them up!"</p>

  <p>Letting out a sneer, Clark waved his hand and flapped out a flame.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the flame quickly spread out, covering the range of tens of millions of feet above their heads, as if it could burn a hole in the sky.</p>

  <p>Normally, all bugs and insects were afraid of all kinds of flames. Clark's idea was to burn these small bugs to ashes in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, not a single one of them was burnt to death.</p>

  <p>The blazing flames continued to spread in the air, but the purple mist around them had not decreased at all.</p>

  <p>"What? How can these bugs survive my flames? That's weird!" Clark exclaimed, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>If these weak little bugs were not even afraid of the flames of a Holy Being, that could only mean they were immune to all types of flames.</p>

  <p>"I am unable to spread out my spiritual sense," shouted a Demi-holy Being, panicking.</p>

  <p>His concern raising panic among the others, they also tried to release their spiritual sense. Samuel watched them from where he was, the corners of his mouth curling up into a smile.</p>

  <p>As their spiritual sense started to spread, the quiet purple mist suddenly started to roll crazily.</p>
