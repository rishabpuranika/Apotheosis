<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air was filled with tense chaos. At that moment, the entire Sky Demon Eliminating Array was under tremendous pressure.</p>

  <p>More and more martial artists continued to lose their life vitality, but Preston knew that there was no way back.</p>

  <p>They had little time left--as soon as the Sky Demon Eliminating Array collapsed, all the small skulls would attack and tear them into pieces!</p>

  <p>Just then, Preston saw Ning Yudie and the warriors following behind her.</p>

  <p>"You can just leave!" he coldly said to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>All resistance was futile at that point.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie had brought seven hundred warriors with her to help, their life vitality would eventually be depleted. It still wouldn't flip the tide to their favor and in the end, the Sky Demon Eliminating Array would still collapse and they would all die.</p>

  <p>However, where would Ning Yudie go? Preston didn't know as well.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the purpose of the sorcerer warriors was to capture all the warriors who came here from the Upper World in one fell swoop. If so, then Ning Yudie still wouldn't be able to escape in this great world.</p>

  <p>"Where could I go?" Ning Yudie asked. She, like Preston, also didn't know.</p>

  <p>There was nowhere she could escape. Even if she left right now, doing so would only buy her a little more time. Moreover, she also had other concerns. She was afraid she'd cause a disaster to the Central Region, and fail to resist the temptation of returning to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Preston was silent. Soon enough, he smiled bitterly and said, "Fine!"</p>

  <p>He then waved his hand and ablaze white lines appeared behind him, which formed multiple squares. The squares wrapped around Ning Yudie and spread outwards. After a while, all the seven hundred warriors were individually wrapped in the array.</p>

  <p>"I need your life vitality!" Preston shouted.</p>

  <p>In compliance, the life vitality sea in the bodies of Ning Yudie and all the martial artists stirred up.</p>

  <p>The surging life vitality sea waves swept out and followed the Sky Demon Eliminating Array's space patterns, then gathered on Preston's body.</p>

  <p>Thus, the previously almost dried up Sky Demon Eliminating Array had now regained its lost vigor!</p>

  <p>Some of the space patterns had tiny holes from when the small skulls had bitten them. When the life vitality flowed through them, the gaps began to mend themselves and forcefully pushed out the small skulls.</p>

  <p>"Go die already!" Preston yelled coldly.</p>

  <p>Once again, he forcefully struck out with his palm!</p>

  <p>He figured that since he'd die anyway, he should kill to his heart's content.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Brennan dumbfoundedly watched the scene unfold in front of him up in the sky.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one who saw it. The rulers of the Wind Divine Kingdom, the Harlem Divine Kingdom, and the Star Field Divine Kingdom had also arrived and witnessed it. They watched the war closely in the royal palace, worry evident on their faces. After all, the war was right in the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>"Just how strong is that person in the array?"</p>

  <p>"Our Divine Kingdom Continent does not have tablets of high level Space Law to cultivate, but there are records of the high level Space Law! The space folding is something of the eighth layer or the ninth layer of the Space Law."</p>

  <p>"Is this person a world lord from the legends?"</p>

  <p>It was known that the four divine kingdoms had some connections with the Upper World. In addition, the secret sect in the Thoughtless Minds which absorbed people's Faith Energy also had their branch in the Divine Kingdom Continent. Thus, they had also heard about the matters of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that..."</p>

  <p>"If a world lord is being hunted, then what exactly did happen in the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>Several rulers were shocked at their realization.</p>

  <p>However, their guess about Preston's cultivation was wrong.</p>

  <p>Since Preston himself didn't have the ability to control space folding, he relied on the Sky Demon Eliminating Array to perform such a technique.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he was able to keep the small skulls away because his strength was comparable to that of a world lord. He wouldn't have unleashed such great power without the Sky Demon Eliminating Array.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Sky Demon Eliminating Array's magic needed a huge amount of life vitality from many Soul Sea Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>Those two elements combined formed what many had seen as Preston's power, and such power was unsustainable.</p>

  <p>More sorcerer warriors continued to die, while the small skulls multiplied.</p>

  <p>The small, pesky skulls flew everywhere. What was worse was that as long as they were near the Sky Demon Eliminating Array, they crazily bit on everything!</p>

  <p>"I am losing my life vitality so fast..." Yudie's lips curved down into a frown.</p>

  <p>The life vitality sea in her body decreased rapidly as well.</p>

  <p>She wasn't considered strong as she had less life vitality in her Soul Sea than the core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>She didn't look too good, and the other warriors weren't much better.</p>

  <p>After all, the number of small skulls had doubled and the Sky Demon Eliminating Array had to bear double the pressure!</p>

  <p>After just an hour, many of the warriors had consumed more than half of their life vitality in their life vitality sea.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists tried to meditate on the spot and absorb the vitality between heaven and earth for their own use, but the vitality in the Lower World was far inferior to that of the Upper World. Moreover, even to absorb the vitality between heaven and earth in the Upper World would be far from enough. Unless they had an infinite supply of life vitality jades, they might not be able to sustain balance.</p>

  <p>Another hour had passed!</p>

  <p>About forty thousand skulls had now swarmed the place.</p>

  <p>The massive influx of small skulls were like sharp blades that floated above everyone's heads. Once they exhausted their life vitality, the small skulls would suddenly chop down like guillotines. The people would surely die!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie quietly crushed a supreme life vitality crystal. If even the life vitality jades weren't enough to replenish her life vitality, what more could the life vitality crystals do? It was like a single drop of water in the life vitality sea that had dried up completely.</p>

  <p>She wasn't the only one. The Soul Seas of all the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were also drained.</p>

  <p>Amidst the desperate situation, all eyes turned to Preston.</p>
