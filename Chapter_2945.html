  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reincarnation was a little known topic to the people in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Carlo wanted to drive Iris away, but Zheng who was a consummate True God stood his ground in front of her.</p>

  <p>He did all that with a look of impatience on his face. "What do you mean he's your husband? My son has just been born!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>Iris tried to calm him down with an explanation but Zheng interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, "have you ever heard of reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>Carlo shook his head. "You're not really taking reincarnation seriously, are you?" he asked with a skeptical look on his face.</p>

  <p>"I understand if you don't take me seriously for now, but you'll know what I mean as soon as the baby grows up," Zheng explained. "I just have one request? name him Tianming." As he spoke, he tapped the space ring with his finger. It flashed briefly and then a long sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake Sword meant death for Tianming. Now that Tianming was reborn, Mike would be unable to use the sword to control his fate again and Tianming was not fit to use it anymore.</p>

  <p>The sword in Zheng's hand was a top-level supreme primordial weapon. It wasn't the most powerful weapon around. It wasn't even more powerful than the supreme treasures of belief possessed by the Holy Beings. But it was very rare.</p>

  <p>Its kind was rarely seen in the first and second-tier clans.</p>

  <p>"This is for Tianming," said Zheng, gesturing to offer the sword. He also took dozens of pills out and laid them on his palm.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the pills, the bodyguards of the Ye Clan gasped. They weren't familiar with the pills, but the unique scent suggested that they were something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Even Carlo looked panicked at the sight of them.</p>

  <p>The pills and the sword combined amounted to a value that was worth half of the Ye Clan's possessions. That was a lot considering that the Ye Clan was a first-tier clan. Carlo stammered through a response, "What did my son do to deserve this?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face had a knowing smile. "He once saved my life," he said. "These things are nothing compared to that. From here on out, he will be given enough resources for his cultivation every year. I hope that he can become a True God before he turns ten years old."</p>

  <p>Carlo, for a moment, thought that Zheng might be kidding. But the serious look on Zheng's face said otherwise.</p>

  <p>"By the way, is your clan under the jurisdiction of the Leng Clan?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Carlo nodded.</p>

  <p>"Alright. I'll have Jeremiah arrange protection to this divine city," Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>Zheng referred to the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan by his name. This made Carlo think that there was something more going on between them. Zheng didn't ask anything from them except to name his son Tianming. It all sounded too good to be true.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you want to live here instead of returning to the Floating Island?" Zheng asked, looking at Iris.</p>

  <p>Iris firmly nodded with a smile. "I want to watch him grow up," she declared.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to dictate Iris's decision, but he still told her some things that she needed to be concerned about. Before leaving, Zheng turned to Carlo and said, "Take good care of Iris and Tianming. I promise that by the time Tianming is thirty, he would become a Holy Being. Your clan will be one of the greatest."</p>

  <p>"Become a Holy Being?</p>

  <p>And one of the greatest clans?"</p>

  <p>Carlo was left in a trance.</p>

  <p>The Ye Clan became a first-tier clan thanks to Carlo's leadership. However, he was only a top-rank True God, and had no qualifications to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>For him, it was unthinkable that his clan could become one of the great clans.</p>

  <p>'Who is this guy? Where does he get the confidence to promise such big things?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Carlo turned to Iris to ask what was on his mind. "May I know your name, Miss?" he started.</p>

  <p>"My name is Iris Dongfang," Iris answered with a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>"Iris Dongfang." Carlo's eyes widened. "Dongfang? From the Dongfang Clan in the Ray Tree?"</p>

  <p>Carlo knew of the Dongfang Clan as one of the most powerful clans in the divine land, but he didn't know about the destruction of the Dongfang Clan yet.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Iris replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>Carlo was quiet. He was trying to calculate his next move. "Who was that man? Does he really have the power to command the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan?"</p>

  <p>"His name is  Zheng Luo, a friend of my husband. I'm not sure if he can command the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan, but he has driven all the powerful clans out of the Time Sea. Can I see Tianming?" Iris seemed disinterested. She only wanted to see Tianming.</p>

  <p>'Could she be lying? Did that man drive the powerful clans out of the Time Sea?' Carlo thought, glancing at Iris. 'She doesn't look like a liar, ' he figured.</p>

  <p>Carlo decided to investigate the truthfulness of Iris's claim himself. After half a month, though, all his doubts were set aside when Jeremiah personally came to the Ye Clan for Tianming Ye.</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan appeared quite sincere and he promised never to collect money from the Ye Clan forever. Besides, he promised that his clan would take in some True Gods of the Ye Clan every year.</p>

  <p>All at one, the fate of this first-tier clan in a remote place was changed because of Tianming Ye.</p>

  <p>The baby would grow strong in the Ye Clan. He had a bright future ahead of him. He was trained to be an outstanding legend.</p>

  <p>Right in the middle of the Time Sea, a huge island was floating.</p>

  <p>It was over ten thousand times larger than an ordinary Floating Island. It looked like it was the size of thousands of divine cities.</p>

  <p>Zheng never really got rid of other powerful clans' Floating Islands. Instead, he moved them to the outskirts of the Time Sea. The Holy Beings of the powerful clans no longer had the right to modify and control the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Soon, the emerging Floating Island would become the center of the entire divine land. It would attract talents from all over, including the newly born Nine Li people. These Nine Li people inherited memories and gifts from previous lives and practiced at an alarming speed. In the future, there would be a virtuous competition between the divine citizens and the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished all these arrangements, Zheng intended to take Nelly, Liusu and Aleyna to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Nelly had always wanted to see where Zheng was born, but she didn't look excited at that moment. "Zheng," she finally spoke up. "I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to get along with them."</p>

  <p>She had known of the other women's existence.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about it," Zheng said encouragingly. "You'll get along just fine."</p>

  <p>He patted Nelly's head gently.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Liusu glared at Zheng. Trailing behind them, Aleyna yelled,</p>

  <p>"Zheng, my brother-in-law, have you said that to every other woman you've had?"</p>
