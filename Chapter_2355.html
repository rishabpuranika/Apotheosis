  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng surveyed the area.</p>

  <p>Certain that he wasn't in any danger, he bowed to the skeleton with cupped hands. "Sir, you must have led me here for a reason. I apologize if what I'm about to do offends you."</p>

  <p>He had no qualms with the consummate True God of the Sword Clan, but it was necessary to search through his remains for anything he might have left behind. Zheng swallowed. He felt uncomfortable and disrespectful touching this consummate True God's bones.</p>

  <p>Master Evil shook his head in his head. If it were him, he would directly take anything he could find away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng pulled the three sword-shaped rings from the dead True God's phalanges and studied them.</p>

  <p>Still not knowing what to do, he took some chaotic energy and injected it into one of the rings. The moment the chaotic energy touched the ring, the ring emitted a bright white light and turned extremely hot.</p>

  <p>"Shit!"</p>

  <p>Burned by the scorching heat, Zheng dropped the ring.</p>

  <p>As the ring turned in the air, it morphed into a small sword which quickly grew larger and larger.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the sword had transformed into a silver sword that was over three hundred feet long.</p>

  <p>The huge silver sword contained a very sharp sword intent. Its blade glinted under the sun, resembling a giant silvery ship.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It flew away and pierced through the air, leaving waves of sand in its trail.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a dull thud, the huge silver sword drilled into a huge sand dune causing a wide and deep hole in the dune. It continued and drilled into another sand dune.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! dozens of sand dunes were drilled into by the huge silver sword all the way. The muffled sound spread far away and finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>Most of the sand piles were lifted by the power of the silver sword, and the skeleton was all buried. Zheng eyed the swiftly collapsing sand dunes not far away with a look of astonishment on his face.</p>

  <p>"This is amazing..." muttered Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Master Evil was stunned. "This power is so terrifying."</p>

  <p>Although Master Evil had lived a lot of eras in the divine land, this was the first time he saw such a powerful magic weapon.</p>

  <p>There was a multitude of True Gods in the divine land, but very few had reached the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>The three rings were the consummate True God's body protection weapons, and it was not strange at all that they held such power.</p>

  <p>As he watched, Zheng felt his heart sink. The rings had amazing powers and he just wasted one.</p>

  <p>Sliding the remaining two on his fingers, he buried his hands into the sand and willed his strength source to spread out.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The power that came out from Zheng's body caused the sandy ground to shake and bubble. With a groan, the sand that piled around him dispersed and revealed the skeleton.</p>

  <p>He did not know what kind of method this consummate True God used, but Zheng was certain that he was led here for something.</p>

  <p>Crouching down, Zheng carefully turned the skeleton over. At last, he found a dark ring on the skull. From the black ring, an almost invisible wave of soul, weak as a thread, could be sensed.</p>

  <p>"That white shadow must have been produced by this ring. And that shadow drilled into it at last," concluded Zheng.</p>

  <p>He extended his hand towards it and as soon as his fingers made contact with the ring, a faint gravelly voice suddenly spoke.</p>

  <p>"Here... The desert... It is too dangerous... Go north... Be careful with the black spears..."</p>

  <p>Once this consummate True God perished, his soul would cease to exist forever.</p>

  <p>With the passage of time, the consummate True God's soul which was stored in the black ring had worn out and almost disappeared. What was left in the black ring was not even a remnant soul anymore, but a wisp of repeated consciousness.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng couldn't hear it clearly, he repeatedly listened to the ring until he remembered its words.</p>

  <p>There were many things that Zheng still did not understand, but what he did know was that this desert was so dangerous that even a consummate True God died in it. If Zheng, a mere low-rank True God, came across danger...</p>

  <p>'Leave this place now!'</p>

  <p>His brain screamed at him.</p>

  <p>Before he left, Zheng glanced at the skeleton.</p>

  <p>Then, he made a big hole in the ground, laid the skeleton in it, and buried it. After a long time, he should finally be able to rest.</p>

  <p>Since he had already taken the three rings, Zheng didn't take the black ring off. It was a spiritual treasure and carried the consummate True God's last wisp of consciousness. It didn't feel right to walk away with the last evidence of his existence.</p>

  <p>Zheng transformed into an arrow once again and shot towards the north.</p>

  <p>However, not long after Zheng left, the sand started to surge from the place where the skeleton was buried. For some reason, the skeleton slowly appeared from the sand and resumed its original state.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had obtained two powerful rings, his heart weighed heavy in his chest.</p>

  <p>In the boundless desert, Zheng ran north for six hours until the sky dimmed.</p>

  <p>There was no sun in this world and the light just gradually dimmed. Two hours later, the sky had turned completely dark. The whole desert was completely immersed in absolute darkness, leaving Zheng blind.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise however, as soon as darkness came, the empty and desolate desert suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Specks of yellow light began to glow on the surface of the huge sand dunes. From afar, it looked like there were lamps burning in the distance.</p>

  <p>When Zheng narrowed his eyes and focused on the tiny lights, he discovered that it was actually strange bugs that were producing the lights.</p>

  <p>Every one of the bugs was partially hidden in the sand, with only ugly heads exposed in the air.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>A frown formed on Zheng's face. Something was wrong here.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a yellow light suddenly appeared beneath his feet and a bug's head shot out through the sand.</p>

  <p>"Goo! Goo! Goo!"</p>

  <p>The moment the strange bug rushed out, it charged at Zheng and opened its mouth.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Zheng kicked the bug, breaking it into two. The bottom half of its body rolled down the sand dune.</p>

  <p>As soon as he killed the bug, more yellow lights lit up around Zheng.</p>

  <p>Countless bugs came out of the sand dunes and grew as big as trees.</p>

  <p>They wrapped around Zheng in the blink of an eye, about to devour him completely.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Zheng unsheathed the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>He couldn't use the Emotion Closing Godly Way here, but he was not going down without a fight.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The sword light spread out in all directions and dozens of strange bugs fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>He had just killed a batch of strange bugs but more of them came out of the ground. There was now a steady flow of them.</p>

  <p>"You can't kill all these strange bugs. Hurry up and leave this place!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil told him.</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped fighting off the strange bugs and made his way through the gap and rushed out.</p>

  <p>The strange bugs swarmed the desert like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stopped, the bugs would completely surround him so Zheng could only run wildly.</p>

  <p>He had no idea where he was heading in the dark. He just kept running for a few more hours in the darkness. He didn't know how far he had run until he saw a white pillar of light in front of him.</p>

  <p>And below the light pillar stood several cloaked figures.</p>

  <p>He had been running on the desert for quite a while now and all he could see were the strange bugs so Zheng got excited at the sight of the human figures.</p>
