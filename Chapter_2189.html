  <p>
</p>

  <p>Two blazing circles continued to revolve within Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>During this process, the previously disordered internal momentum began to settle within him and he felt a sense of enlightenment sink into the depths of his soul.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng felt as if he was able to see the true meaning of the Purple Aura Godly Way!</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>"The Purple Aura Godly Way is not consummate because the woman who carved this Godly Way Tablet did not cultivate it up to the consummate stage. Actually, even if she did reach the consummate level, displaying all of her comprehension on the tablet may not have been what she wanted!"</p>

  <p>Zheng judged in an instant.</p>

  <p>Each of the three thousand Godly Ways was completely different. The Grand Purple Aura Technique could create a myriad of sword arrays and transform into several extremely powerful true spirits. Its final level meant it could transform into a Purple Sky Land!</p>

  <p>However, the description for the Purple Sky Land remained incomplete.</p>

  <p>"If I want to gain complete enlightenment of the Grand Purple Aura Technique, I'll need to find a complete Godly Way Tablet... I didn't expect that with this Infinity Ruler, I could actually see through the internal momentum and figure out the essence of the Grand Purple Aura Technique. This..."</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been perplexed as to how to use the Infinity Ruler but now, he was finally able to appreciate its extraordinary ability. Even if the treasures of the divine land were still a bit of a foreign concept to Zheng, he knew very well that this Infinity Ruler was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The light of the Infinity Ruler gradually dimmed down as it returned to its original state. However, it was slightly different from before.</p>

  <p>A small dot appeared on a scale in the middle of the ruler. Zheng took a closer look and discovered a faint, purple light that flowed through the center of the dot— the essence of the internal momentum!</p>

  <p>"This ruler... has absorbed the Purple Aura Godly Way?" he remarked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng once again examined the jade ruler, carefully counting the scales from beginning to end. He was able to get a number: three thousand scales.</p>

  <p>In short, this jade ruler was meant to contain the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Once the light disappeared, so did the two blazing rings in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum that Zheng had initially disturbed became silent and orderly once again.</p>

  <p>Wanting to test his hypothesis quickly, the young man had no plans in staying there any longer. He immediately set out to leave but, just as he turned his head, a dark-purple pillar of light shot out from the top of the Godly Way Tablet and headed straight for the ceiling of the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>A purple halo enveloped Zheng as the pillar of light reached him.</p>

  <p>The sight stunned all proving godly warriors present.</p>

  <p>Even Malloy and the Heavenly Han House's True Gods who taught the Godly Ways were also surprised.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has been acknowledged by the Purple Aura Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"Then that means he has the talent to cultivate the Purple Aura Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. He clearly has never possessed the Purple Power Body..."</p>

  <p>It was understandable for the people to be confused. This scene they were currently witnessing completely exceeded their common sense.</p>

  <p>May stared at Zheng with her mouth agape, not really understanding how he managed to be acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng knew that the one that had been acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablet wasn't him but the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Outside the Consulting God Hall, Malloy and the True Gods were at a complete loss as to what to do.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? Should we declare that Zheng is qualified?" the old man surnamed Chen asked.</p>

  <p>Malloy had a strange and puzzled expression on his face. "He is indeed qualified but it's impossible. There's no way he could cultivate the Purple Aura Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>"That's not the worst part," another True God reminded.</p>

  <p>Malloy sighed. "I have also thought of this."</p>

  <p>There were many warriors in the divine land who possessed the Purple Power Body but not many had the actual talent to practice this Godly Way. Moreover, the vast majority of them were women.</p>

  <p>Joy, as the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, enjoyed high status and power, only second to the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan. She could also recruit disciples but her most basic requirement was being able to cultivate the Grand Purple Aura Technique.</p>

  <p>A warrior who was acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablet of the Purple Aura Godly Way did not enter the Heavenly Han House but was given to Joy instead.</p>

  <p>Since these were the rules, the Heavenly Han House would not be given the chance to admit such warriors.</p>

  <p>Malloy had been afraid that the girl in green from the Floating Island would be the one to take Zheng away. Now, it seemed another problem had arisen.</p>

  <p>"If I knew this was going to happen, then I wouldn't have let him participate in the test," Malloy cursed to himself.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Heavenly Han House were strict but it could always be circumvented for the right and worthy individual. Had he known that Zheng was going to be acknowledged by the tablet of the Purple Aura Godly Way, he would've found a reason to exempt the test for the young man and admitted him directly.</p>

  <p>They had been extremely curious as to what Godly Way was suited for Zheng and also wanted to observe his talent more clearly. None of them expected such a strange thing to happen.</p>

  <p>"Keep this matter a secret," the old man surnamed Chen advised, his eyes flashing in determination.</p>

  <p>Hesitation was painted on the True Gods' faces. Joy was someone who was definitely powerful in their eyes. The consequences of deceiving her would surely be hard to bear.</p>

  <p>However, Malloy nodded his head in agreement. "I won't announce it...</p>

  <p>Hmm. I'm not really sure what Tianxing is trying to do."</p>

  <p>Within the Consulting God Hall, the sight of Zheng being acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablet incited envious and also strange feelings among the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Most of them were confused especially with the fact that Zheng had obviously been acknowledged, yet no announcement was heard from the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't willing to wait for Malloy to announce his acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>He was still very eager to test the jade ruler in his mind.</p>

  <p>Since the jade ruler had been able to absorb the Purple Aura Godly Way, then it should, in theory, be able to take in the other Godly Ways as well.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablets around them were mere fakes created by True Gods but the internal momentum within them was genuine. If one more Godly Way could be absorbed then it would be to Zheng's benefit in the long run.</p>

  <p>He jumped down the stairs and gave May a passing smile.</p>

  <p>May had initially intended to give it her all in comprehending the Godly Way Tablet and get herself acknowledged. Seeing Zheng easily succeed in doing so made her feel extremely disappointed. She watched him disappear into the distance and thought about just how different people could be.</p>

  <p>As he jumped down, Zheng quickly made his decision and chose another Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>The tablet he chose had rays of raging flames circling around it. Before Zheng could even climb, he already felt a scorching aura.</p>

  <p>The Elementary Fire Godly Way...</p>

  <p>This was the origin of all strange flames in the world and the purest form of fire.</p>

  <p>With the Elementary Fire Godly Way, one would be able to comprehend all kinds of mysterious flames.</p>

  <p>There were already three proving godly warriors on the stairs of this Godly Way Tablet and one of them was ranked second on the great list— Seth.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed when he saw Zheng climb up the stairs. He then began to wonder whether Zheng wanted to be acknowledged by the second Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>Normally, so long as one was acknowledged by a Godly Way Tablet then that person would automatically gain the qualifications to enter the Heavenly Han House. It was quite rare for a warrior to be acknowledged by two Godly Way Tablets. Only four warriors had accomplished such a feat in history.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed Zheng was planning to do the same.</p>

  <p>Unknown to Seth, this wasn't exactly Zheng's intended goal. The young man didn't just want to be acknowledged by mere two Godly Way Tablets. If he was given enough time, Zheng had every intention of letting all three hundred Godly Way Tablets be absorbed in the Infinity Ruler!</p>

  <p>Seth and the others made way for Zheng the moment they saw him climb up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other proving godly warriors all stopped comprehending and watched Zheng intently.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>Just like what happened with the Purple Aura Godly Way, the moment Zheng climbed, the internal momentum immediately surged towards him.</p>

  <p>This time, it came in the form of numerous fire birds.</p>

  <p>These flames were formed by the internal momentum and were capable of burning the soul. If one's soul was weak, then it would be incinerated in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was not afraid at all and allowed the fire birds to flow into his mind...</p>
