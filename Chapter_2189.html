  <p>
</p>

  <p>Two blazing circles continued to revolve within Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>During this process, the previously disordered internal momentum began to settle within him and he felt a sense of enlightenment sink into the depths of his soul.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he was able to see the true meaning of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>"The Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao is not consummate because the woman who carved this Divine Dao Tablet did not cultivate it up to the consummate stage. Actually, even if she did reach the consummate level, displaying all of her comprehension on the tablet may not have been what she wanted!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng judged in an instant.</p>

  <p>Each of the three thousand Divine Dao was completely different. The Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique could create a myriad of sword arrays and transform into several extremely powerful true spirits. Its final level meant it could transform into a Purple Sky Land!</p>

  <p>However, the description for the Purple Sky Land remained incomplete.</p>

  <p>"If I want to gain complete enlightenment of the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique, I'll need to find a complete Divine Dao Tablet... I didn't expect that with this Infinity Ruler, I could actually see through the internal momentum and figure out the essence of the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique. This..."</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been perplexed as to how to use the Infinity Ruler but now, he was finally able to appreciate its extraordinary ability. Even if the treasures of the divine land were still a bit of a foreign concept to Luo Luo Zheng, he knew very well that this Infinity Ruler was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The light of the Infinity Ruler gradually dimmed down as it returned to its original state. However, it was slightly different from before.</p>

  <p>A small dot appeared on a scale in the middle of the ruler. Luo Luo Zheng took a closer look and discovered a faint, purple light that flowed through the center of the dot? the essence of the internal momentum!</p>

  <p>"This ruler... has absorbed the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao?" he remarked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng once again examined the jade ruler, carefully counting the scales from beginning to end. He was able to get a number: three thousand scales.</p>

  <p>In short, this jade ruler was meant to contain the three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Once the light disappeared, so did the two blazing rings in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum that Luo Luo Zheng had initially disturbed became silent and orderly once again.</p>

  <p>Wanting to test his hypothesis quickly, the young man had no plans in staying there any longer. He immediately set out to leave but, just as he turned his head, a dark-purple pillar of light shot out from the top of the Divine Dao Tablet and headed straight for the ceiling of the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>A purple halo enveloped Luo Luo Zheng as the pillar of light reached him.</p>

  <p>The sight stunned all proving godly warriors present.</p>

  <p>Even Malloy and the Heavenly Han House's True Gods who taught the Divine Dao were also surprised.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has been acknowledged by the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Then that means he has the talent to cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. He clearly has never possessed the Purple Power Body..."</p>

  <p>It was understandable for the people to be confused. This scene they were currently witnessing completely exceeded their common sense.</p>

  <p>May stared at Luo Luo Zheng with her mouth agape, not really understanding how he managed to be acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the one that had been acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet wasn't him but the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Outside the Consulting God Hall, Malloy and the True Gods were at a complete loss as to what to do.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? Should we declare that Luo Luo Zheng is qualified?" the old man surnamed Chen asked.</p>

  <p>Malloy had a strange and puzzled expression on his face. "He is indeed qualified but it's impossible. There's no way he could cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao..."</p>

  <p>"That's not the worst part," another True God reminded.</p>

  <p>Malloy sighed. "I have also thought of this."</p>

  <p>There were many warriors in the divine land who possessed the Purple Power Body but not many had the actual talent to practice this Divine Dao. Moreover, the vast majority of them were women.</p>

  <p>Joy, as the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, enjoyed high status and power, only second to the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan. She could also recruit disciples but her most basic requirement was being able to cultivate the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique.</p>

  <p>A warrior who was acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao did not enter the Heavenly Han House but was given to Joy instead.</p>

  <p>Since these were the rules, the Heavenly Han House would not be given the chance to admit such warriors.</p>

  <p>Malloy had been afraid that the girl in green from the Floating Island would be the one to take Luo Luo Zheng away. Now, it seemed another problem had arisen.</p>

  <p>"If I knew this was going to happen, then I wouldn't have let him participate in the test," Malloy cursed to himself.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Heavenly Han House were strict but it could always be circumvented for the right and worthy individual. Had he known that Luo Luo Zheng was going to be acknowledged by the tablet of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, he would've found a reason to exempt the test for the young man and admitted him directly.</p>

  <p>They had been extremely curious as to what Divine Dao was suited for Luo Luo Zheng and also wanted to observe his talent more clearly. None of them expected such a strange thing to happen.</p>

  <p>"Keep this matter a secret," the old man surnamed Chen advised, his eyes flashing in determination.</p>

  <p>Hesitation was painted on the True Gods' faces. Joy was someone who was definitely powerful in their eyes. The consequences of deceiving her would surely be hard to bear.</p>

  <p>However, Malloy nodded his head in agreement. "I won't announce it...</p>

  <p>Hmm. I'm not really sure what Tianxing is trying to do."</p>

  <p>Within the Consulting God Hall, the sight of Luo Luo Zheng being acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet incited envious and also strange feelings among the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Most of them were confused especially with the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had obviously been acknowledged, yet no announcement was heard from the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't willing to wait for Malloy to announce his acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>He was still very eager to test the jade ruler in his mind.</p>

  <p>Since the jade ruler had been able to absorb the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, then it should, in theory, be able to take in the other Divine Dao as well.</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao Tablets around them were mere fakes created by True Gods but the internal momentum within them was genuine. If one more Divine Dao could be absorbed then it would be to Luo Zheng's benefit in the long run.</p>

  <p>He jumped down the stairs and gave May a passing smile.</p>

  <p>May had initially intended to give it her all in comprehending the Divine Dao Tablet and get herself acknowledged. Seeing Luo Luo Zheng easily succeed in doing so made her feel extremely disappointed. She watched him disappear into the distance and thought about just how different people could be.</p>

  <p>As he jumped down, Luo Luo Zheng quickly made his decision and chose another Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>The tablet he chose had rays of raging flames circling around it. Before Luo Luo Zheng could even climb, he already felt a scorching Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The Elementary Fire Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>This was the origin of all strange flames in the world and the purest form of fire.</p>

  <p>With the Elementary Fire Divine Dao, one would be able to comprehend all kinds of mysterious flames.</p>

  <p>There were already three proving godly warriors on the stairs of this Divine Dao Tablet and one of them was ranked second on the great list? Seth.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed when he saw Luo Luo Zheng climb up the stairs. He then began to wonder whether Luo Luo Zheng wanted to be acknowledged by the second Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>Normally, so long as one was acknowledged by a Divine Dao Tablet then that person would automatically gain the qualifications to enter the Heavenly Han House. It was quite rare for a warrior to be acknowledged by two Divine Dao Tablets. Only four warriors had accomplished such a feat in history.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed Luo Luo Zheng was planning to do the same.</p>

  <p>Unknown to Seth, this wasn't exactly Luo Zheng's intended goal. The young man didn't just want to be acknowledged by mere two Divine Dao Tablets. If he was given enough time, Luo Luo Zheng had every intention of letting all three hundred Divine Dao Tablets be absorbed in the Infinity Ruler!</p>

  <p>Seth and the others made way for Luo Luo Zheng the moment they saw him climb up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other proving godly warriors all stopped comprehending and watched Luo Luo Zheng intently.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>Just like what happened with the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, the moment Luo Luo Zheng climbed, the internal momentum immediately surged towards him.</p>

  <p>This time, it came in the form of numerous fire birds.</p>

  <p>These flames were formed by the internal momentum and were capable of burning the soul. If one's soul was weak, then it would be incinerated in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid at all and allowed the fire birds to flow into his mind...</p>
