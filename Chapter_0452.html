<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 452 Blood Burning (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the battle between Luo Zheng and Tianming was less ferocious than that between Luo Zheng and Jacques. At least for the moment, it looked like that.</p>

  <p>After all the cyan dragon's roar during that particular event had been terrifying, shocking, and destructive. It was the sort of thing that Luo Zheng would never forget.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's horrible strength had erupted fighting with Jacques, his battle with Tianming was more fascinating. This was because most of the previous battle had been fought secretly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had used his demonic life vitality to shroud the fighting pit in mist and not let anyone see. Though the audience had heard the terrifying roars of dragon, they had no idea what was going on inside that mist.</p>

  <p>But this battle, between Luo Zheng and Tianming, was something else!</p>

  <p>Both of them were swordsmen who had a thorough understanding of the sword intent. They were considered one of the best sword masters in Cloud Sect and the battle between them was extremely balanced; so much that it could have ended in a stalemate.</p>

  <p>One of them was a once-in-a-century genius who had already penetrated deep into the supernatural mysteries inside the Heavenly Sword Illustration. Therefore, he was capable of using the power of the heavens against his enemies. The other man, a simple and noble practitioner, wielded his sword in a mysterious but basic way. He refused to cower even while confronting the heavens' power. His sword was held smartly and he fought back effectively.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, all the disciples of the Cloud Sect were unimaginably excited. After Tianming's failed Heavenly Sword demonstration, they were now looking forward to seeing something much bigger and more shocking.</p>

  <p>The elder disciples of the Cloud Sect had already witnessed the All Peak Competition many times in their lives and they had, at times, even been able to anticipate the outcome. However, none of the previous competitions could have been compared to this.</p>

  <p>"Tianming's abilities in wielding a sword are unbelievable. I mean he is the first guy ever to enter the fourth level of the Heavenly Sword. And he is the first in eight centuries. And Luo Zheng... Zheng's more than that. He has even been able to confront the forces of the Heavenly Sword with some basic sword methods. I have never seen anyone defeating mystical things with basic skills all my life."</p>

  <p>"It's unfair. When I was practicing the sword, the wizard in my village told everybody that I was born to be a great and successful swordsman.</p>

  <p>But it turns out that I'm just a joke compared to these two guys."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is the sort of person you'd call crazy. He succeeded in making use of such ordinary things to defeat such superpowers. How could he manage to exert enormous power by wielding his sword in some basic ways."</p>

  <p>While the disciples discussed the battle, the elders and the saints who were watching the battle from outside the fighting pit sighed that their time was now gone. This era now belonged to these young and talented disciples. So many talented and excellent disciples had shown themselves in this All Peak Competition, each with their own area of expertise. One of them would surely grow up and start a glorious, new era.</p>

  <p>Tianming wiped the blood from around his mouth. He stared at Luo Zheng coldly, surprised.</p>

  <p>He had thought that his Four-in-One art of fencing was powerful enough to beat Luo Zheng and had never expected Luo Zheng to survive that. However, he had clearly under-estimated his opponent and his fighting capacity.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just flicked his sword, which had exerted a simple but extremely powerful force, in which the force of the stars was hidden. It had been strong enough to shield him against heavenly forces.</p>

  <p>What surprised Tianming the most was that Luo Zheng had created the force of stars merely with his life vitality instead of borrowing its power from other places.</p>

  <p>Even after that, how could he defeat the Heavenly Sword?</p>

  <p>In contrast to Luo Zheng, practicing the art of Heavenly Sword and trying to learn from the Heavenly Sword Illustration had allowed Tianming to communicate with the heavens. It was a rare thing to accomplish but Tianming had succeeded, despite all odds. Therefore, he had become the real master of the Heavenly Sword.</p>

  <p>This way, his powers just now had come from the heavens themselves.</p>

  <p>He had actually borrowed the heavenly forces for this attack.</p>

  <p>None of them were his.</p>

  <p>However, the forces of the stars were the ones Luo Zheng had artificially created through contemplation. How was that even possible? Did he accomplish this by looking at the stars?</p>

  <p>It was rumored that some warriors from the Eastern Region had once tried to look at the stars and contemplate to enhance their martial arts.</p>

  <p>After they had entered the nature level, all of them were known to be trying so desperately to find some strange things for their contemplation.</p>

  <p>They would carefully look at sword, knife, bow and arrow, stone, tree, house, picture or other strange and seemingly unrelated things.</p>

  <p>Some had even gone further and tried to look at the stars, the moon, and the sun.</p>

  <p>But the stars were far away and subtle. How could they succeed in borrowing power from stars? How could they turn their life vitality into the force of stars?</p>

  <p>And even if some of them had managed to make some progress, none of them had actually succeeded in figuring out the spirits of the stars. When they had tried to turn their life vitality into stars, all they had got in return was useless stones. There was no force near the stars to find. Nothing.</p>

  <p>Therefore, those warriors had abandoned the seemingly powerful but actually useless things like the moon, the sun, the stars, the sea and the mountain. These things only looked impressive or even imposing.</p>

  <p>However, time and time again, they had failed to empower the warriors.</p>

  <p>It was worth mentioning that some talented folks had accidentally figured out how the star force worked but those were just legends. And none of them had ever risen from the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Tianming had no idea that Luo Zheng didn't have to contemplate and search for the stars in the sky. He just needed the Sun Moon Stars Picture, which didn't belong to this world at all.</p>

  <p>The strength of the masters who had drawn and produced the Sun Moon Stars Picture had been unimaginable.</p>

  <p>"I thought that I had no rival at the same level with me. Even the warriors who have reached the Illuminating Soul Realm would have surely suffered defeat at my hands. I have only one rival, Patrick. If I was fighting with him right now, I would have stood a 50-50 chance of success. However, if I, with strength of the nature level consummation, had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, it would have been impossible for me to lose!" Tianming remarked slowly.</p>

  <p>Patrick remained motionless and showed no emotions on his face, sitting cross-legged and with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Then, Tianming added, "I need to think bigger and go to a larger world.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Region is too small for me and discourages me to grow up or become stronger. I have the whole world ahead of me to conquer. I need to challenge the thousands of talents born in this world. I need to do better than this little Sect. After the All Peaks Competition, I don't care if I'm allowed to walk across the Cloud Road or not. I will go to the Central Region and find a bigger world to conquer."</p>
