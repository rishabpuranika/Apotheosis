<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3514 Blackmail </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Two giant figures stood at the main entrance of the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>The giants were as tall as hills, but their heads were not much larger than a human's.</p>

  <p>They would have made for a funny sight were it not for their threatening auras. The weapons in their hands were only ordinary-looking, thick wooden clubs, but light constantly flashed through the cracks on them.</p>

  <p>They were clearly not ordinary weapons.</p>

  <p>When the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace arrived at the gate, one of the giants shifted the thick wooden club in his hand and blocked the way.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were used to this. One of them walked forward and talked to the two giants politely. He took out some soul pills from his space ring.</p>

  <p>The cost of entering the Myriad Spirits City was not high, but there were more than a hundred disciples, so in sum, it was a large expense.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would foot the bill.</p>

  <p>But even after the senior disciple paid the soul pills, the giant refused to open the door. He pointed at Luo Zheng and Feng Ge with his wooden club. "Those two can't enter!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Feng Ge frowned.</p>

  <p>The giant didn't seem to be highly intelligent and only knew souls. He apparently saw Luo Zheng and Feng Ge as creatures on the Other Shore. Even if strictly speaking, they didn't really belong to that classification.</p>

  <p>"Why?" the senior disciple asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"You have to pay tenfold soul pills for creatures on the Other Shore," the giant said.</p>

  <p>No one from the Taiyi Heaven Palace had ever come to the Myriad Spirits City with their corporeal bodies before, so even the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief had no idea about this rule.</p>

  <p>Tenfold soul pills were not a big amount. Moreover, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would compensate for the extra soul pills. The senior disciple paid them without hesitation, and even gave another twenty thousand soul pills to the two giants as a gift.</p>

  <p>After receiving the extra soul pills, the two giants grinned contentedly and turned to press their hands on the huge door.</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>The huge door was pushed open by the two giants.</p>

  <p>'The giants' strength is about 1, 200 Jun, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Such strength was nothing in the Source World, but it was still very powerful on the Other Shore. At the very least, the Souls of Light would have found it difficult to handle.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge, who was a purified being, should be able to put up a resistance to it.</p>

  <p>But there would be other powerful creatures in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>After the door was pushed open, a straight and wide path was revealed to everyone, extending ahead of them to the far distance.</p>

  <p>The buildings in the Myriad Spirits City were of different styles. Some of them were unusually large, while some were small and low. This was really a city where many races dwelt.</p>

  <p>From time to time, creatures of completely different shapes and appearances passed along the path.</p>

  <p>Although there were also many races in the Source World, they were all born in the same round of chaos, and made up of flesh and blood. However, many creatures on the Other Shore had fled from the past rounds of chaos, like the Green Jade Civilization and the Metal Civilization. Their forms differed greatly. These creatures were naturally stranger.</p>

  <p>"Look! What creature is that?" someone asked, pointing at what looked like a hemp rope crawling on the ground.</p>

  <p>The gray hemp rope was made up of over one thousand sections. It resembled a snake, but had no head or tail.</p>

  <p>"This is not just one creature. There are about a thousand creatures connecting to each other. They are the Thousand-Section race," a senior disciple replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace grew curious and surrounded the rope.</p>

  <p>The rope started trembling before its constituents scattered away, and then gathered together again to form a strange shape.</p>

  <p>At this, a sudden change came over the senior disciples. One of them quickly came forward, smiling, and spoke to the members of the Thousand-Section race in a pacifying voice.</p>

  <p>After a while, the members of the Thousand-Section race scattered again, returned to the rope-like formation, and resumed crawling on the ground.</p>

  <p>"These creatures won't just attack anyone, but you must be careful with your words and deeds. If you unwittingly provoke them, you will suffer consequences," the senior disciple warned.</p>

  <p>The creatures had actually been in a battle array just now. Although each of them was only the size of a thumb, when all of them were gathered together, their explosive power was enough to instantly kill the Souls of Light present.</p>

  <p>"Understood," the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace replied in unison. They would take care to behave themselves from here on out.</p>

  <p>These creatures were the same as the Abyss Spirit race in Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>They couldn't afford to offend them.</p>

  <p>After they had walked along the path for a distance, the disciples were led to another remote path. A senior disciple pointed ahead. "Our stronghold is up ahead," he said.</p>

  <p>In the horizon, there was a low wooden building, old and shabby in appearance.</p>

  <p>The disciples felt a little disappointed at the sight. The Taiyi Heaven Palace seemed to be much weaker in the Desire World than it was in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>At least in Stage Four, the Taiyi Heaven Palace had a lofty temple. It seemed to have nothing in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Sensing the disappointment of the disciples, one of the senior disciples sought to appease them. "Stage Fourteen is just a springboard. The strongest warriors of our Taiyi Heaven Palace are all in the upper stages. If you are talented and persistent, you won't stay in this stage for long."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, unlike the other disciples, wasn't surprised by the situation of the Taiyi Heaven Palace in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit race dominated Stage Eleven and had all the super forces in the Source World under their command. The creatures in the Desire World were stronger and were in larger numbers. Naturally, the Souls of Light didn't have as high a status as them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng still found it unbelievable just how low the Souls of Light's status here was.</p>

  <p>As they approached, they saw several creatures walk through another path.</p>

  <p>These creatures walked upright with two feet, but their heads resembled that of insects, their arms as sharp as steel cones.</p>

  <p>They gathered around the doorway of the wooden building. "Come out and meet us!" one of them called out in a sharp voice.</p>

  <p>At this, several Souls of Light hurried out, led by Abdul. There were usually some disciples guarding the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Abdul was usually arrogant and fierce in front of disciples who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but he was very subservient to the insect men. "My friends, what brings you here?"</p>

  <p>The leader of the insect men scoffed disdainfully, "You are merely Souls of Light. How dare you claim to be the Taiyi Heaven Palace? That's hilarious!</p>

  <p>But no matter! When will you give us the thirty finger-size chunks of soul crystal and thirty jades?" the insect-looking leader demanded.</p>

  <p>The reason the weak Souls of Light had difficulty establishing a foothold in the Myriad Spirits City was that they were constantly blackmailed like this by these creatures on the Other Shore.</p>
