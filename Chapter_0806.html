<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 806 The Ogre Governor (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Wobbling on his foot while he took a step backwards, the ogre stammered,</p>

  <p>"D..devil?"</p>

  <p>The leader hurriedly mounted his horse and with a whip, he swiftly fled from the scene.</p>

  <p>The martial artist originally planned to kill the head of the ogres along with the others. Unfortunately, the leader was beyond the reach of his soul power as he stood farther from the group, and Luo Luo Zheng could not gather the strength to move as of the moment. It was definitely a pity that he could not slay him like the rest.</p>

  <p>Sighing to himself, Luo Luo Zheng decided to let him go for now. His priority right now was to make himself able to move as soon as possible due to the fact that they were not sure when the next threat would appear.</p>

  <p>After having expelled the force of space from his spine, Luo Luo Zheng began to focus his energy in expelling the force of space in his legs. Being unable to move had always been a nuisance to him and it became his most urgent problem to solve.</p>

  <p>Right when Luo Luo Zheng fixated on enabling his body to move once more, the boy standing next to him suddenly knelt down in veneration.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Craig go down on his knees and bow his head at the man, more and more people strode out of their tents and bent down on their knees in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was as if they had seen a miracle happening right before their very eyes as someone single-handedly managed to kill all of those ogres in an instant.</p>

  <p>These long suffering human beings who had been kept against their will in the pasture as livestock thought that only God would be able to accomplish such an impossible task. It was as if in their eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was the God they had been waiting for.</p>

  <p>Living in the pasture, no one was willing to be eaten by the ogres. Perhaps it was their survival-of-the-fittest mentality working that they gave up a few members of their race every year in exchange for the existence of their tribe. It was a sacrifice no one wanted to do themselves but was something direly needed for their continuation.</p>

  <p>With the sudden showcase of Luo Zheng's prowess in slaying the ogres, they had seen a silver lining in the midst of heavy and grey rain clouds.</p>

  <p>It was a possibility they had suddenly considered; maybe Luo Luo Zheng was the God that had been sent to this forsaken place to save them from the ogres.</p>

  <p>Despite their display of respect and gratitude, Luo Luo Zheng turned a blind eye to them. With his heart thudding loudly in his chest, he knew he did not have much time left. It was evident in his mind that the enemies about to come would be stronger ones, and all he could think about was to recover as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>A couple of hours had passed by when Luo Luo Zheng finally regained his senses in his legs. With the new ability to use the muscles on his legs, the young man turned over slightly and managed to sit upright. At the very least, he was not confined to lying completely still on the hard bed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Four more hours later, both of Luo Zheng's hands had fully regained consciousness. At the same time, he took out a pill from his space ring and swallowed it unceremoniously. When he passed through the purple space windstorm which had already taken a great toll on him to begin with, his body retained many hidden injuries and deep gashes that were different from the space power remaining on his being.</p>

  <p>Several hours passed by agonizingly slow as Luo Luo Zheng continued to try his best and heal himself from the inside.</p>

  <p>Blinking his eyes open, Luo Luo Zheng scanned his surroundings and his vision picked up on something appearing on the verge of the prairie. It seemed as if the clump-like objects were too far away to identify clearly. Just by where Luo Luo Zheng was sitting, it looked more like a black line in the distance.</p>

  <p>Rubbing his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng made sure that his vision was perfect before narrowing his eyes. Leaning closer, Luo Luo Zheng finally made out that what he had seen just moments before was a line of numerous ogres who were offensively running towards him.</p>

  <p>"Hundreds... No, thousands of ogres?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng mumbled as he squinted his eyes further.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had cultivated the killing way due to his experience of being challenged and provoked, he had not killed that many people up until that moment. Truthfully speaking, he had made sure that the people he slayed were usually those individuals who he thought deserved to die.</p>

  <p>However, in Luo Zheng's line of reasoning, the army of ogres marching towards him were aliens, therefore, they were not the same species as him.</p>

  <p>Standing up and looking at them with ferociousness, his tone echoed a sense of indifference when he stated with such conviction, "Since all of you like courting death so much, I hope you are ready to be killed and turn into my malicious Mu Ning."</p>

  <p>The reactions of the other humans were much different than his. This was because when they had first heard the bold shouts of the ogres and subsequently turned to see them stomping towards where they stood, they all shrieked and immediately fled behind Luo Luo Zheng, choosing to look at the man from afar.</p>

  <p>Although the humans believed in their theory that Luo Luo Zheng was a man of divinity, they still held doubt in their hearts about him possibly defeating thousands of ogres by himself. With feelings of trepidation and anxiety running through the human beings as they crowded in a corner, they muttered among themselves about the odds of Luo Luo Zheng making it out of this encounter alive. However, they knew that a deity had the ability to work miracles on impossible situations. Although they lacked sense and were ignorant of the outside world, they still had high hopes that Luo Luo Zheng would triumph over their doubts and surprise them once more with his strength.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Among the faceless mass of ogres, there proudly stood an ogre who adorned himself with a golden helmet and a matching golden armor. His booming voice rose through the throng of ogres which made his other comrades hold the reins of their tall horses and peer menacingly at Luo Luo Zheng from hundreds of feet away.</p>

  <p>"Human, have you come from the Purple Heart Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>The ogre leading the army inquired in a heavy, bellowing voice. All of the ogres behind him assented and yelled at their leader's question as a form of support.</p>

  <p>'Purple Heart Sacred Place?' he frowned as he thought, the name of the place not ringing a bell or even giving him a blurry recollection of a memory. After much consideration, Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up at the realization. "Is there a sacred place on this continent?" he mumbled to himself as a vague thought started to form in his head. Judging from the ogre's tone and how they had reacted to his demand, the location he had mentioned seemed to be a sacred place created by humans themselves.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, he had mistaken on one thing: the status of humans on this particular continent was not as miserably low as he had imagined. There was a possibility that more of his race roamed the lands of the strange place.</p>
