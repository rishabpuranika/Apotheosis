<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng hit the wall, he turned over to give the fox girl a surprise attack.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A loud rumble that came after almost deafened Zheng.</p>

  <p>After slamming into the wall, the fox girl turned around expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>"Your reaction speed isn't bad, but? it's not nearly impressive!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened before his body turned over once again.</p>

  <p>But the fox's speed was far superior to Zheng's. Before he could move, a hand grabbed his arm.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The fox lifted him up like nothing and threw him right back down to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The two had extremely tough bodies, carrying terrifying strength. Every time Zheng smashed into the ground, an invisible shock wave would spread.</p>

  <p>Those Other Shore creatures also became smart. As long as the two of them had any tendency of getting near them, they would hide far away, afraid of being hurt from the impact.</p>

  <p>With such a terrifying power, anyone who was hit by the slightest shock wave would die or at least get crippled.</p>

  <p>Every time the fox girl threw Zheng down, the Other Shore creatures trembled. While they feared the fox, they were all the more amazed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>No wonder both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race wanted him.</p>

  <p>The guy's body was extremely strong indeed.</p>

  <p>Egan, on the other hand, seemed worried.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's physical body was undoubtedly strong, he couldn't withstand the situation if it was prolonged. Regardless of what kind of theurgy Zheng used to stabilize his body, the fox's brute force was going to break it sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang..."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Gourd Robe Kirk released was highly unique. While it could withstand fifty thousand divine megatons of force, it carried an important feature? it could be reborn infinitely.</p>

  <p>Each time the fox girl smashed Zheng into the ground and the impact exceeded the fifty thousand divine megatons limit, the Heavenly Gourd Robe instantly shattered.</p>

  <p>But just when she lifted Zheng up, the Heavenly Gourd Robe instantly wrapped around Zheng's entire body once again. In turn, the Heavenly Gourd Robe could actually be regarded as an enhanced version of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Heavenly Gourd Robe wasn't comparable to the Chaotic Source Spirits in Zheng's body. Its only shortcoming was that there was a time limit to its use.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Gourd Robe and the Chaotic Source Spirits worked together to protect Zheng's body, the latter could withstand one hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force directly.</p>

  <p>The fox girl had used only a hundred thousand divine megatons of force in the first few strikes, bearing no damage to Zheng.</p>

  <p>But once she confirmed just how strong his body was, the fox girl didn't hesitate to increase the strength of her strikes.</p>

  <p>One hundred and ten thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>One hundred and twenty thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>One hundred and thirty thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>She figured Zheng could only bear up to ninety thousand divine megatons of force because that was the most power he displayed in his previous attacks.</p>

  <p>But it was becoming clear to her just how high Zheng's tolerance was.</p>

  <p>Still, she knew he was not completely invincible? if she continued increasing the power of her strikes one at a time, sooner or later, she knew she was going to shatter him to pieces.</p>

  <p>"One hundred and forty thousand divine megatons of force!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng hit the ground, there was a sharp noise that resounded along with a loud rumble of impact.</p>

  <p>The moment he hit the ground, Zheng twisted his body suddenly like he was holding onto a wooden pole. He then grabbed the fox's glazed arm with both hands and feet.</p>

  <p>A hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force was his limit.</p>

  <p>Once the attack exceeded the limit of what his body could bear, the Chaotic Source Spirits would grow fatigued enough that his body could take damage? he absolutely had to fight back.</p>

  <p>Just as he grabbed the fox girl's arm, ready to throw her back, the fox sneered, looking at him pitifully.</p>

  <p>She was by no means inferior to Zheng when it came to controlling strength.</p>

  <p>When he leaned back, about to throw her out, the fox turned the situation around and rolled over agilely in the air, grabbing Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, she landed and lifted Zheng high in the air, ruthlessly throwing him to the wall. Her movements were highly skillful? she made no unnecessary movements.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The power that erupted from the impact had already reached a hundred and sixty thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Gourd Robe and Chaotic Source Spirits helped bear a hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force. The extra ten thousand had to be borne by Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>His Myriad Tribulations Body had nine Bone Tribulation Imprints? he was by no means weak. When he forcefully resisted the power of ten thousand divine megatons, he could only feel his blood roiling inside him and nothing else.</p>

  <p>"Huh, you can withstand a hundred and sixty thousand divine megatons of force, I see. Let's continue, then." The fox walked toward him threateningly.</p>

  <p>The smile she wore could easily be an innocent one, save for the terrifying threat hidden underneath.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures knew Zheng's body was strong, but they didn't know exactly what sort of great power he was enduring. Hearing just how powerful the force was made them gasp in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful was this man?</p>

  <p>Even after being smashed into the ground so many times, his body remained intact.</p>

  <p>"One hundred and seventy thousand divine megatons of force?"</p>

  <p>Before she even finished, she had already grabbed Zheng's neck with her hand.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng wanted to dodge, but the fox already saw through him.</p>

  <p>Shifting a foot in one direction, she caught him with accuracy.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng grew anxious.</p>

  <p>If the Chaotic Source Spirits were not exhausted, they could be continuously repaired.</p>

  <p>But recovering from fatigue could take a while.</p>

  <p>If he used his physical body to withstand the power of a hundred and seventy thousand divine megatons of force, even with the help of the Heavenly Gourd Robe, it would far exceed his limit.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Power burst out of Zheng's arms, passing under the fox's arms and ready to lift her up.</p>

  <p>When she was in the air, her feet swept past Zheng's head and suddenly kicked into the wall.</p>

  <p>Under the great counterforce, she once again grabbed Zheng in the air, ready to smash him into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Repair.."</p>

  <p>Fear surfaced in Zheng's eyes. The truth aura within his body was constantly surging? if the Chaotic Source Spirits weren't repaired, the attack could easily shatter him to pieces.</p>

  <p>As he fell to the ground, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body lit up once again before recovering.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's body had to withstand the extra twenty thousand divine megatons of force. His face turned red as his blood and energy surged radically.</p>

  <p>"Your body protection theurgy can't withstand it anymore, I see?" The fox girl looked condescendingly down upon Zheng.</p>

  <p>The slight change in Zheng's body could easily go unnoticed by anyone else, but not the fox girl. "It seems your limit should be a hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force. The further we go, the more difficult you'll find it to bear the power. I'd better send you to your death in one go!"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred thousand divine megatons of force!"</p>

  <p>In truth, Zheng could actually bear exactly two hundred thousand divine megatons of force. But after the Chaotic Source Spirits grew completely tired, the limit was reduced by a hundred thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>When she increased her power to two hundred thousand divine megatons, she had every intention to kill him.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits in Zheng's body were still fatigued when the fox's attack was falling? how could they dare to face it?</p>

  <p>And so Zheng held his breath and shifted his body a foot away.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The fox's glazed hand stabbed into Zheng's chest, making blood spurt out like a sharp arrow.</p>

  <p>A long lost feeling of pain rose in him. After obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits, no one had ever really managed to hurt him.</p>

  <p>The fox's hand that pierced Zheng's body slashed down, heading for Zheng's cinnabar field? she intended to completely destroy his inner world. If she succeeded, he'd lose all contact with his Other Shore Tokens, cutting off his very source of strength.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, after Zheng merged with a Chaos Ancient God's blood, the bones in his body had undergone a great change. The thick layers of sclerites abruptly blocked her hand.</p>
