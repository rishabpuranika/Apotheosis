  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianming had been travelling the Abyss Demon Region for years and naturally knew how dangerous this place was.</p>

  <p>However, the presence of so many Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings assured him, Rachelle and the other consummate True Gods that this exploration wasn't going to be as dangerous or difficult.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought they'd be stuck in such a situation?</p>

  <p>As the little fiend prepared to rush towards him, Tianming immediately waved his hand.</p>

  <p>A long purple sword appeared, looking extremely sharp and intimidating.</p>

  <p>Its sword intent increased and a sword light shot towards the little fiend.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to get hit, the little fiend suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>He reappeared near him and his big mouth was wide-open, aiming to devour Tianming's long sword.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Three, large, vicious bites.</p>

  <p>That was all it took for the purple sword, given to Tianming by Nicholas, to get devoured by the little fiend.</p>

  <p>After the sword, the little fiend wasn't satisfied and aimed for Tianming's head.</p>

  <p>However, as he got near him, that irresistible will was transmitted over again!</p>

  <p>Despite wanting to bite Tianming's head, the little fiend couldn't seem to do it.</p>

  <p>He immediately hung his head down in despair.</p>

  <p>Why couldn't him bite this young man's head off?</p>

  <p>At the same time...</p>

  <p>Nicholas, who was below the crowd, had gotten near enough and was right above the huge fiend's head.</p>

  <p>He gathered a powerful force in his hands and pushed.</p>

  <p>Two, black palm shadows appeared in the air and ruthlessly pushed the fiend down.</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>There was a shocking, explosive sound.</p>

  <p>This huge fiend, called 'Wrath', was immediately smashed onto the soft mud below.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas wasn't yet done.</p>

  <p>Not pleased with his handiwork, he patted the ground a few more times.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Each slap was a tremendous force that had to be endured by the fiend.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the fiend became bigger and bigger, almost as if he was going to expand indefinitely.</p>

  <p>However, his huge body soon got stuck in the soft mud and sank deeper each time.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to kill this little fiend and Nicholas did not really have any intention to do so. All he needed to do was to trap these little creatures and escape as fast as they could from this purple mist.</p>

  <p>As he pressed this fiend, effectively trapping him in the mud, Nicholas did not forget to send out a message to the Holy Beings through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>He told them of the direction the other little fiends came from. This information was no doubt going to be valuable to the others.</p>

  <p>Without Nicholas, many Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings might end up getting eaten.</p>

  <p>After fully burying the fiend in the ground, Nicholas and Murphy exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his hand, Murphy took out a jade rune.</p>

  <p>He shot the internal momentum into this rune before smashing it heavily on the ground!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion and the entire earth began to shake!</p>

  <p>The ground that surrounded them within a thousand-mile radius was merely soft quagmire.</p>

  <p>However, in just a blink of an eye, it turned into hard, solid ground.</p>

  <p>This was the power of the Earth Spirit Seal.</p>

  <p>It was a theurgy beyond the Earth Godly Way Murphy had comprehended.</p>

  <p>As the earth solidified, all the power would evenly spread out.</p>

  <p>Once sealed, even a Holy Being would find it difficult to escape.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Despite his efforts to contain the fiend, however, a huge crack suddenly appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>"This thing is very extraordinary," Murphy exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas immediately shot up towards the sky!</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had already flown at quite a high altitude but they still couldn't get rid of the purple mist. As Nicholas flew, he launched several palm strikes in the air.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>Two, huge, black hands appeared and hit several fiends as he flew.</p>

  <p>The little fiend Tianming fought had chosen to give up on him and was now on the process of looking for his next goal.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas was already on the move and immediately shot down this little fiend with his black palm shadow.</p>

  <p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief and sped up.</p>

  <p>The purple mist was thankfully not that thick and they were able to escape after a while.</p>

  <p>"The third stage of the Abyss Demon Region is so dangerous..."</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered, holding Tianming's Memory Flame in his hand.</p>

  <p>The memories within this flame were updated on time. Zheng could retrieve anyone's Memory Flame and read their latest thoughts.</p>

  <p>This was on a whole other level of mind-reading!</p>

  <p>He was greatly relieved when he saw Tianming escape to safety with the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile... the top-rank True Gods sat cross-legged on the stairs.</p>

  <p>Memory Flames floated in front of them.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Land was not something they could control or even get involved in. However, since they were already here, then they were determined to at least bring something back with them.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's help, they were able to acquire some consummate True Gods' Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>These flames recorded precious comprehension that one could witness, feel, and understand.</p>

  <p>After mastering the comprehension within these flames, they could break through and finally become consummate True Gods! However, the possibilities did not stop there.</p>

  <p>These Memory Flames had been stored here for countless years, which meant that there were countless comprehension techniques that were now available to them. So long as they withstood the flames, they could have endless experience in cultivation to comprehend.</p>

  <p>This was infinitely more precious than any rare treasure.</p>

  <p>These Memory Flames could help them a lot!</p>

  <p>Leland, however, was less enthusiastic about it.</p>

  <p>He was already a Demi-holy Being, after all.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to become a Holy Being, all he needed to do was to pass through the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>It was meaningless for him to comprehend other people's cultivating experience. Instead of being entranced by the Memory Flames, he was more concerned with what he could find behind that huge door.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not stop him.</p>

  <p>Leland did not have the Nine Li blood, so he wasn't able to pass the test arranged by the hall soul after entering the Reincarnation Hall. Getting the Latent Theurgy now solely depended on his own ability.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's main agenda was finding out a way to get out of here.</p>

  <p>They had entered this place through a cave at the edge of the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>However, some parts of the cave merely existed as an illusion.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be only one exit in the entire Reincarnation Land and it connected directly to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>
