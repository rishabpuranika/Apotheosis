<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With regards to the other ogre warriors, their hearts had obviously been brimming with so much anger after they witnessed how Zheng had completely disgraced their companion by throwing the items he had within his space ring all over the ground. Out of all races, the ogre warriors could probably be considered as the most prideful one. If they could bring honor to their race, they would have no qualms about putting their lives on the line. Meeting their death while standing on the battlefield would even be a great honor.</p>

  <p>In spite of feeling that way deep in their hearts, at the moment, not a single one of them could muster up the courage to anger Zheng. No one could even hold him responsible for anything.</p>

  <p>"Let's go ahead. Refining this icy lotus should be of huge benefit to you,"</p>

  <p>Zheng told Freya, letting out a soft smile before turning around and walking away.</p>

  <p>Nodding her head in response, Freya stored the icy lotus in her space ring and proceeded to follow after Zheng. As she walked by the remains of the ogre warrior, she saw up close what a mess was left all over the ground. In that pile, there were many rare and precious objects, and the hundreds of life vitality jades scattered all over was in no way a meager amount of wealth.</p>

  <p>A tinge of hesitation crept onto her face. Considering that the ogre warrior had died at the hands of Zheng, these items now technically belonged to him. So, wouldn't it be such a waste to leave them lying on the ground?</p>

  <p>In any case, Zheng didn't pick them up, so she opted not to take anything from it as well. That was the least she could do to make sure he didn't lose face.</p>

  <p>After a moment of hesitation, she ended up deciding to let it go and simply continued walking behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>With the match reaching its conclusion, the warriors of the Demon Night along with the human race left as well.</p>

  <p>As for the ogre warriors, they picked up the lifeless body of their own kind and gathered all of the things that had been left on the ground. It should go without saying that all of them had a despondent look on their faces.</p>

  <p>"There's no way our Saint Lord will ever let this human brat go scot-free!"</p>

  <p>"This human brat is bound to leave the underground palace at some point. When that time comes, our Saint Lord will most certainly put an end to him."</p>

  <p>"The Saint Lord is gonna help us get retribution!"</p>

  <p>When they were finally done picking up the remains, they also headed out as well.</p>

  <p>After making their way through the gusts of wind, the group drifted into the other side of the cave. Eventually, they made it back into the abyss.</p>

  <p>Without thinking much of it, Zheng just went ahead and jumped down.</p>

  <p>Xun had already mentioned to him before what the Endless Abyss was like.</p>

  <p>If he were to keep on falling down this abyss, he would have a way to preserve his life and get his hands on precious treasures.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Supreme Lord from remote ages actually even gave every single one of them an opportunity to turn back, bestowing all of them with a divine texture that would let them return to the entrance of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Following closely behind Zheng, Freya promptly jumped down as well, with all of the other warriors behind her also following suit.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Endless Abyss really doesn't have a bottom. If we're falling down like this, then when is it going to stop?" Zheng asked Xun as they were falling.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile creeping onto her face, Xun replied, "Indeed, there is no bottom to the Endless Abyss. The reason for that is because the Supreme Lord from remote ages made use of a special technique to connect the top and bottom parts of the abyss. The truth is that it's actually just a loop."</p>

  <p>"A loop?" Zheng was a bit taken aback.</p>

  <p>"When you reach the bottom of this abyss, what happens is that you just return to the top, without even noticing it. You may be feeling like you're ceaselessly falling down, but in reality, you've only been spinning in a loop, giving you the impression that you are in an abyss without an end.</p>

  <p>Despite being warriors with exceptional capabilities, it was still impossible for any Supreme Lords to set up a bottomless abyss that would go against the limitations," Xun explained to Zheng in great detail.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head in response to what she said, Zheng was finally able to wrap his head around the concept and find out more about the Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>"You might not have realized it yet, but after what you have been through so far, you've actually already completed one full lap around this loop. Of course, after that comes the second lap," Xun added.</p>

  <p>"All in all, how many laps did you make back then?" Zheng asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"Four laps. When I reached the fourth lap, the things I had to come face to face with became much too dangerous, so I had to give up," Xun flatly answered.</p>

  <p>Despite merely being at the Spirit Supreme Realm at that point, Xun had actually become a queen already. She was quite an honorable queen that she even held sway over the Supreme Lords of the Demon Night, so she by no means lacked any sort of resources. It was due to her being concerned of her own safety that she decided to just give up.</p>

  <p>"However, you can't give up this time," Xun went on and added.</p>
