  <p>
</p>

  <p>A trace of doubt appeared across Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin's structure was very special. It was said that if an object was placed anywhere inside the tower, it would slowly be devoured and then disappear.</p>

  <p>The tower's appetite was voracious and would absorb anything whether it might be a spiritual weapon, a fairy weapon, or even a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>It was like a monster? a devourer of lifeless things.</p>

  <p>The practicing rooms, arenas, and all other rooms had already existed way before and had not been built by the creatures of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Despite the ravages of time, however, everything still looked good as new.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng entered the practicing room to find it empty. Upon stepping inside, however, he couldn't help but sense that there was something inside the room that he couldn't see.</p>

  <p>His brows furrowed as he closed the door and found a place to sit.</p>

  <p>The feeling did not subside so Luo Luo Zheng continued to remain vigilant.</p>

  <p>He could feel a special breath within this room!</p>

  <p>However, he could not figure out where it exactly was even with his Fighting Soul. Whatever the hidden creature was, it undeniably had really strong hiding skills.</p>

  <p>Though the Tower of Sin had strict rules regarding fighting and how it was forbidden in the safe zone, assassinations were still very much a thing.</p>

  <p>Phoebe had warned Luo Luo Zheng about this. Being in the limelight with the ogre who bore a grudge against him wasn't the most ideal situation.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought about this, he immediately shot a glance at the corner. 'Is it there?' he thought. His gaze shifted around the room, feeling for that other presence, trying to pinpoint where it was.</p>

  <p>He was now truly positive that there was another living, breathing being in the room with him but the question was where it was.</p>

  <p>Where was it hiding? Where was it awaiting its opportunity to strike? "It doesn't matter. Whoever or whatever you are, you will surely attack me," he muttered to himself as his entire body tensed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already on high alert despite looking relaxed in his place on the floor.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Luo Luo Zheng. The Night Group assassin was also already feeling alarmed. The Night Group was comprised of assassins with the innate talent of hiding their breath.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they practiced a special cultivation method that could manipulate the refraction of light rays leading to the deflection of their enemy's line of sight. This method made them virtually invisible to their opponent and target.</p>

  <p>This particular assassin, however, was feeling extra nervous since Luo Luo Zheng served as his greatest test in the Night Group.</p>

  <p>For the members of the Night Group, the greatest and most dangerous mission they could ever undertake was the assassination of a person within the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The tower's rules were strict and even if he succeeded with his job, it was possible for him to be found out and chased down by the other races. Worst of all, he could be killed. Retreating from the Tower of Sin after an assassination was difficult after all. Success could lead to death while failure surely led to death. It was a job that almost always led to one outcome.</p>

  <p>The moment he accepted his mission was also the moment he put half of his body into the grave.</p>

  <p>This dilemma coupled with the fact that his target seemed to have already sensed his existence. This had the Night Group assassin sweating.</p>

  <p>He was an eighth-level war general so, in terms of strength, he might not even be a match against a fourth-level demon general of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>However, he had once assassinated a war lord from another race outside the Cursed Land, so that meant he still had some tricks up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Besides, his target was only an eighth-level human war fighter. Maybe he was just imagining it. There was no way his target had been able to sense a Night Group assassin's existence, not with his innate breathing ability and cultivation method.</p>

  <p>He was about to relax when Luo Luo Zheng suddenly glanced around as if looking for something.</p>

  <p>'He has noticed my presence!' the assassin remarked to himself in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The thought had him tensing up but another realization had him frowning.</p>

  <p>'Wait? He knows I'm here but isn't willing to leave the room? Is he waiting for me to attack and then he can fight back against me?' he thought to himself before his face broke out in a sardonic grin.</p>

  <p>It seemed his target was quite confident with his strength.</p>

  <p>Maybe he was too confident? at least, for the Night Group assassin. He was someone who had once killed a war lord after all. 'You are only a war fighter, ' the assassin thought arrogantly to himself. 'No matter how talented you are, you will die under my blade!'</p>

  <p>With these thoughts, he then began to make his move by scaling along the walls of the room. He reached behind his back and took out the white bone blade that he used for this very purpose.</p>

  <p>As he moved, the surface of his body flashed with a faint layer of phosphorescence that constantly changed color, effectively camouflaging his entire body. Nobody would be able to sense or see him even if they observed at a close distance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to sit crossed-leg in the middle of the room with his eyes closed, seemingly unaware of the approaching Night Group assassin.</p>

  <p>He was unaware that the one who wished to do him harm was only a step away from him.</p>

  <p>The assassin was already rejoicing in his heart. He had never failed to assassinate any of his targets before, not when he was already this close.</p>

  <p>To him, Luo Luo Zheng was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>"Piercing!" he exclaimed as his bone blade suddenly erupted with power.</p>

  <p>The exact moment he enacted an assassination was also the moment he threw away everything in order to achieve his goal: to kill the target.</p>

  <p>The bone blade in his hand was level with Luo Zheng's chest, ready to pierce through his heart?</p>

  <p>But then, the Night Group assassin suddenly froze!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not avoid nor even launch any counterattacks but the bone blade refused to sink any further into his flesh.</p>

  <p>'How is this possible? Is this guy's body made from steel?' the Night Group assassin thought to himself.</p>

  <p>But even if he was made of steel, the bone blade should've still pierced through or, at the very least, penetrated his body.</p>

  <p>This bone blade had been forged through a secret method of the Night Group. It was sourced from the tibia of a deceased Night Group member and was strengthened and reinforced by a secret ritual. It had the ability to communicate with the user's mind, and even feelings, as if it was his hand.</p>

  <p>And the Night Group assassin was certain that the blade had gotten stuck as its tip pierced the very top of Luo Zheng's skin. It was something he had never encountered before.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly turned his head and smiled at his would've-been killer. "Your hiding skill is remarkable," he said. "You were able to hide in this room and I couldn't find you. But now, well, it's truly a pity..."</p>

  <p>The Night Group assassin's eyes widened. "Retreat!"</p>

  <p>A phosphorescent light suddenly appeared on the assassin's body, partially concealing him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to let you escape!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said, his hand stretching out like lightning.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he had been unable to chase after the assassin's shadow so he had chosen to just wait patiently for him to attack first.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's body became a high-grade fairy weapon, his strength had been enhanced significantly to the point that normal weapons would fail at even piercing through his physical defenses.</p>

  <p>This assassin was truly a daredevil to risk killing someone inside the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>A strong war lord would not be such a daredevil. So Luo Luo Zheng immediately assumed that this assassin's strength would not even match that of a war lord. Despite his marvelous hiding skill, he proved to be too weak to even break through Luo Zheng's physical defenses.</p>

  <p>"BANG!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's hand had curled into a fist and a lightning-fast punch landed on the assassin's shoulder!</p>

  <p>It was only a glancing blow but it was still able to shatter the assassin's shoulder blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch had the assassin rolling away and crawling onto the wall. He had been caught off-guard but it was not over! He took his bone blade and spat a mouthful of blood onto it. The entire blade then began to emit a bewitching red mark, and at the same time, the assassin's eyes were also turning red making him appear as if he was a scorpion lurking on the wall.</p>

  <p>Being a daredevil, he wouldn't sit still and wait helplessly for death to come at the crucial moment. Since he couldn't kill Luo Luo Zheng in a single strike, he fell into an extremely disadvantageous position. If he wanted to turn the tide, he could only fight with Luo Luo Zheng desperately!</p>

  <p>"Did the ogre send you here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Night Group assassin narrowed his eyes. "Do you honestly think I'll answer you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng huffed, "I'm not really interested in knowing." As soon as he said that, Luo Luo Zheng immediately rushed towards the assassin with a raised fist with the intent of punching him once again.</p>

  <p>The assassin rapidly dodged and two loud bangs could be heard as Luo Zheng's fist hit the wall. However, the indentations on the wall rapidly disappeared.</p>

  <p>This was the Tower of Sin's magic? it had the ability to quickly repair itself after being damaged. It was as if it wasn't a tower, but a person who had the ability of instant regeneration.</p>

  <p>Had they been in any other ordinary building, the force of Luo Zheng's punch would've caused the entire structure to collapse.</p>

  <p>The two kept chasing each other in circles. The assassin moved around Luo Luo Zheng and tried to avoid him while Luo Luo Zheng was hot at his heels with a faint smile on his face.</p>
