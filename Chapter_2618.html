  <p>
</p>

  <p>The leader of the Immortal Mansion right now wasn't Hallet, nor was it Augustus.</p>

  <p>It was, instead, the charismatic Harold.</p>

  <p>After Mike died and Bromley left the divine land, it was he who planned and put everything into place.</p>

  <p>He was calm in the face of Xi Youqin's relentless questioning. "Luo Zheng is indeed missing but we are currently working hard in tracing him."</p>

  <p>"Why is he missing?! You... What did you do to him? How did you treat him?" Xi Youqin might look obedient but she quickly grew hysterical if she got angry. She wouldn't be able to distinguish between friend and foe once she got into one of her moods.</p>

  <p>Her temper also made her blind to whether or not the person in front of her was weaker or much stronger than her.</p>

  <p>Joy, however, was quite intrigued by Xi Youqin's temper. She slowly walked up to the young woman and talked to her in a soft, calming tone,</p>

  <p>"The fate will bless Luo Zheng. He'll be fine."</p>

  <p>"How would you know?!" Xi Youqin shot back with a gloomy face.</p>

  <p>Augustus couldn't help but roll his eyes. He wasn't as well-mannered as Hallet and Harold so he wasn't averse to arguing with a hysterical woman. "You know what? Nobody knows if he's fine because nobody knows where he is!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin got even angrier when she heard this. Her eyes were suddenly filled with killing intent and a purple mist started to swirl around her body.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, four long swords appeared beside her and were directly aimed towards Augustus.</p>

  <p>"Hey! How dare you?!" Augustus yelled with an exaggerated expression on his face. Given Xi Youqin's cultivation base, she was only showing off her incompetence in front of an expert. Augustus intended to severely make fun of her.</p>

  <p>However, Joy stood in front of Xi Youqin and gently hooked her fingers.</p>

  <p>The four swords that were on their way to Augustus lost direction and circled around Joy instead.</p>

  <p>This sudden change in trajectory and movement filled Xi Youqin with shock upon realizing that she had lost control over the purple mist.</p>

  <p>What was more interesting was how the four swords quickly dispersed around Joy into purple mist and began transforming into different shapes like dragons, strange birds, and exotic beasts. Joy was now fully in control and could do whatever she wanted.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's eyes couldn't help but widen in amazement as she stared at this scene.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, she had been considered as the authority on the Purple Aura Divine Dao. Not even her master had the same level of awareness she did.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin never truly cared about how powerful she was but she had always been aware of the difficulty others had when it came to surpassing her in the Purple Aura Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Thus, she never expected that this woman in front of her could take control of her swords and even manipulate the purple mist to such an extent.</p>

  <p>"Why can you use the Purple Aura Divine Dao... No, how can you control it to such an extent?" Xi Youqin asked. She knew how powerful she was and also just how difficult it must've been for Joy to have seized the control of the purple mist from her.</p>

  <p>Joy simply smiled. "Would you like to learn it?"</p>

  <p>Any ordinary person would've recognized this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and naturally would've agreed.</p>

  <p>However, Xi Youqin wasn't like any ordinary person. She quickly shook her head. "No."</p>

  <p>Xun, Yudie, and the others expected this answer and could only shake their heads in regret.</p>

  <p>Unlike them, however, Joy was a bit shocked at Xi Youqin's rejection.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You may not care about Luo Zheng's wellbeing but he is my husband! I care very much whether he's dead or alive. I must find him!"</p>

  <p>With these words, Xi Youqin quickly turned to Wayne. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Her orders startled Wayne.</p>

  <p>He hadn't stopped trembling ever since he returned to the Immortal Mansion and firmly hid himself behind Xi Youqin.</p>

  <p>Who were these people?</p>

  <p>There were three consummate True Gods and a Demi-holy Being in front of him. Wayne knew that any one of them could easily kill him if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>He had a faint memory of Augustus tricking him in prison before. Wayne was very careful lest he annoyed them and got sentenced to the dungeon all over again.</p>

  <p>"The divine land is so large! Even if we leave the Swirl Forest, we still won't be able to find Luo Zheng!" he reasoned bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Even if we can't find him, we still need to try!" Xi Youqin declared determinedly.</p>

  <p>The young woman's expression was resolute but Joy couldn't help but shake her head. "Don't put him on the spot. It's impossible for you to find Luo Zheng right now. If you stay here, you have a chance of reuniting with him but if you leave, you might never get to see him ever again."</p>

  <p>She said this not just as an empty threat to Xi Youqin.</p>

  <p>The young woman was already extremely lucky to have found the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Given her personality, she would most certainly just die without a trace if she traveled the divine land.</p>

  <p>"You mean Luo Zheng will come back?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Joy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think so. As long as you are patient."</p>

  <p>Joy once dreamed of more warriors learning the Purple Aura Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, nobody in the Han Clan was able to develop it. In the end, her Purple Soul Hall was dismissed.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin was most probably arranged by Mike to be her disciple. She wouldn't miss the opportunity to impart her wisdom to this young lady.</p>

  <p>With her temper quenched, Xi Youqin finally agreed to stay in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>As for Wayne, he quickly said his farewells in fear of the two men from the Gu Clan taking him back to the dungeon.</p>

  <p>The divine land was now in a temporarily stable state.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, who originally planned to conquer the Abyss Demon Region, gave up on this idea for the meantime.</p>

  <p>Tianming, who had successfully snuck inside the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island, chose not to enter the forbidden areas to fight. He would leave the Time Sea once in a while. Divine cities would collapse every now and then and the stone tablets they housed would mysteriously disappear.</p>

  <p>Lone had opened that door and set his foot down upon a new path of fate.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Wynn helped the Godly Geniuses steal out one after another and also activated the 833rd rule continuously. Given the extraordinary talents of these Godly Geniuses, they too forged their own paths upon entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>Some of their paths were clear and straight, while others deviated slightly.</p>

  <p>This deviation brought unexpected adventure but also great danger.</p>

  <p>Some advanced sharply but others ended up getting killed.</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred thousand wild bones!"</p>

  <p>Over one hundred Wild Gods helped Luo Zheng extract the Wild God Power and inject it into the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>"Gnash..."</p>

  <p>Under the immense pressure of his bones tangled together, Luo Zheng's bone membrane continuously made this nasty, rasping sound.</p>

  <p>The pain intensified even more!</p>

  <p>It was even more difficult for Luo Zheng now as he tried to become a top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>Once one reached this peak, it was said that there would be no more bottlenecks. A warrior's body had the potential to grow infinitely as long as they devoured enough wild bones.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Adele and several others managed to reach astonishing heights of three to four million feet.</p>

  <p>However, none of them were able to break through to the Other Shore Realm. This was a dilemma they had to face since the rules that matched the Wild Gods in the whole chaos were no more.</p>
