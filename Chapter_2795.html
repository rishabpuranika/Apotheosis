<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2795 The Power Of Cold Air </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The others, who were waiting at the groove, looked at Nicholas in anticipation, waiting for his decision.</p>

  <p>Nicholas contemplated for a moment and then announced, "After the chill subsides, we will head to the next groove."</p>

  <p>No sooner had the words left his mouth than the cold air from the huge volcano stopped.</p>

  <p>The wind caused by the cold air also disappeared without a trace. An eerie silence spread across them.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas shot a derisive glance at the woman above and rushed together with all the members of the union of powerful clans to the groove on the other side.</p>

  <p>The groove was about three to four thousand feet away from them. Thanks to their incredible strength, they could reach it in the blink of an eye and in a single step.</p>

  <p>"That's right." The woman raised the corners of her mouth slightly and said,</p>

  <p>"Let's also go down!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The woman floated ahead, and Luo Zheng and Sword Chen followed her closely, who in turn were followed by the clones of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Luo Zheng set foot on the first groove of the volcano. The groove was exactly where Nicholas and the others had been previously.</p>

  <p>However, there were no Demi-holy Beings or consummate True Gods in Luo Zheng's group. With just about 20 people, it wasn't very crowded here.</p>

  <p>The cold air from the large cave in the center of the ice volcano only stopped for a split second.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng entered the groove, a terrifying roar erupted from below the cave.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>A milky white cold gust of wind erupted again from the bottom of the cave and rushed straight to the sky.</p>

  <p>Most of the people from the alliance of the powerful clans were staring at the woman with pure animosity in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"I would much rather fight with them than let her put us into a corner!"</p>

  <p>"Right. Don't continue to go down. Let's go back up to kill them!"</p>

  <p>"But if it weren't for her, we would have done the same thing, wouldn't we?" said one of the Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans found the coffin and the snow mountain, so they would naturally explore its inner world.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to reach the bottom of the cave, they had to move using the grooves on the cave wall.</p>

  <p>Without the woman, they, too, would take the risk.</p>

  <p>That was just how human mentality worked. If we were forced, we would be defiant, despite choosing the right path.</p>

  <p>"No need to argue. Just continue going downwards," ordered Nicholas.</p>

  <p>After Nicholas issued the command, the others had nothing to say.</p>

  <p>Just then, the woman in the groove above stuck her head out again.</p>

  <p>Despite her bright and seemingly cheerful smile, everyone could not help but feel nervous. It was as though she called the shots on whether or not they could live.</p>

  <p>"A friendly reminder," the woman chimed sarcastically, pointing at the third groove on the wall of the cave, "these grooves are now very old. With the passage of time, some cold air has collected in them. So there might be some Cold Fiends in the grooves below. Be very careful!"</p>

  <p>"Cold Fiends? Are they ferocious?" Clark asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>The woman put her index finger on her lips and thought for a while. Then she said, "Think about it yourself. They should be strong. They can easily kill a few Holy Beings at least."</p>

  <p>"Kill a few Holy Beings? What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"She is talking utter nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Just ignore her and keep moving!"</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of the powerful clans were sullen now.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't want to believe what the woman said, they were scared deep down in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not," the woman pouted mockingly.</p>

  <p>The cold wind from the cave would blow for about five minutes and then stop.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat on the edge of the groove lost in thought, watching the rising cold air absentmindedly.</p>

  <p>He was wondering what kind of energy the cold air possessed. Even the Holy Beings would be frozen immediately if they touched it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also practiced the Ice Soul Flame of the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao. However, compared to the cold air of this ice volcano, it was like a walk in the park.</p>

  <p>Reflecting on this for a while, Luo Zheng wanted to give it a try.</p>

  <p>He gently flipped his palm and an ice blue flame appeared in it.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's cultivation had improved, the Ice Soul Flame he had practiced before emitted a strong chill from his palm.</p>

  <p>He gently pushed his palm forward.</p>

  <p>The tiny, long Ice Soul Flame left the groove and collided with the rising cold air in the cave.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A strange phenomenon took place.</p>

  <p>The Ice Soul Flame froze instantly!</p>

  <p>And the milky white cold air was transmitted to him through the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>"This is bad!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was taken aback. He was about to withdraw his hand, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>He felt that his right hand had become numb. He tried his best to summon the internal momentum to dispel the cold air, but failed miserably.</p>

  <p>"The strength source!"</p>

  <p>He could only utilize his strength source in desperation.</p>

  <p>However, as the strength source started pouring into his arm, it also vanished instantly as if the invisible force was frozen too.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened.</p>

  <p>It all happened in seconds. When his facial expression changed, the cold air traveled up his arm and passed to one side of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just then, the woman gently moved her fingertips, and a sharp brown thin thread zipped towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It swiftly sliced off the frozen Ice Soul Flame. So in effect, the bridge between the cold air outside and Luo Zheng was cut off.</p>

  <p>But it was not that easy to get rid of the cold air outside. Once it came into contact with someone or something, it would take over.</p>

  <p>So the flexible thread also froze in an instant, and the turbulent cold air wound up along its length.</p>

  <p>When the cold air was about to reach the woman's fingertips, she flicked them lightly, and the thread broke off from her fingers and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The thread had become hard and brittle, so it made the sound of glass breaking upon impact. It was broken into pieces on the ground and cold air emitted from its remains.</p>

  <p>"Don't do anything stupid again! It's very dangerous here. If anything goes wrong, even I can't protect you," warned the woman. She stared at Luo Zheng with a pleasant smile on her face. She didn't mean to reproach him.</p>

  <p>He nodded slightly and shook his stiff right arm.</p>

  <p>Only after the woman cut off the Ice Soul Flame was he able to regain sensation in his numb arm. If it wasn't for her, he would have been an ice sculpture.</p>

  <p>"What kind of cold air is this? It is so powerful!" Luo Zheng asked overcome with curiosity.</p>

  <p>The woman explained with a faint smile on her lips, "It's not cold air, but a way of energy flow. It's just the effect of the energy flowing."</p>

  <p>"The way of energy flowing?" It was the second time that Luo Zheng had heard such words from the woman. He was puzzled.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded and said, "Yes. That's why the True Demon Body is so strong!"</p>
