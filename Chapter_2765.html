<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a swordsman, Sword Chen was obsessed with all kinds of swords.</p>

  <p>However, he had been stuck in the Sea of Meditation for too long. Out of all the swords he had, only three of them were supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Moreover, supreme primordial weapons could be classified into different levels of power; the three swords he had were the ordinary kind.</p>

  <p>And aside from these three swords, all the swords he had were regular weapons in the divine land; even ordinary citizens could easily obtain them.</p>

  <p>"These are all I have. I wonder if you have a spare sword?" Sword Chen asked, turning to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Then, he went over to the long table and gently tapped the space ring in his hand.</p>

  <p>Swords fell out of the space ring and scattered all over the table.</p>

  <p>From the divine land to the prison at the bottom of the chaos, Zheng had not been particular about collecting treasures along the way.</p>

  <p>Whenever he did stumble upon a treasure, however, he would secretly stash it away in his space ring.</p>

  <p>Every now and then, he would sort out all the items in his space ring and throw away whatever he didn't need, especially common items.</p>

  <p>Therefore, almost all of the items he had accumulated in his space ring were rare and valuable.</p>

  <p>Even though he had left some common supreme primordial weapons behind in the fairy palace, there were still quite a number of treasures in his space ring.</p>

  <p>Clang, clang, clang...</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's eyes widened as he watched the longswords tumble out of Zheng's space ring one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Supreme primordial weapons!"</p>

  <p>"There are dozens of long swords, and all of them are supreme primordial weapons..."</p>

  <p>"This brown sword seems to be a supreme chaotic weapon! What's the name of this sword?"</p>

  <p>Looking at the excitement on Sword Chen's face, Zheng shrugged sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember..."</p>

  <p>He had probably gotten this brown sword from the space ring of some Wild God, so naturally, he didn't know its name.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he couldn't understand why a Demi-holy Being like Sword Chen was being this enthusiastic about a bunch of swords.</p>

  <p>With Sword Chen's current strength, these swords should be no more than scraps of metal for him.</p>

  <p>And Zheng's line of thought was completely right, of course.</p>

  <p>With Sword Chen's cultivation and strength, these swords were truly not worth his attention.</p>

  <p>However, back when Sword Chen had entered the divine land, the Floating Island of the Luo Clan had been on the verge of collapsing, so he had been forced to flee into the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>It was a pity for him that he hadn't had the time to gather all kinds of swords in the divine land.</p>

  <p>So, being a sword fanatic, he couldn't help but feel excited at seeing all these swords after such a long time of being stuck in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>So far, Zheng had taken out more than 100 swords from his space ring and piled them up on the table. Moreover, Sword Chen had already mentioned that he had refined 128 longswords and inserted them in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>"Are these enough?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course!" Sword Chen touched one of these swords with his hand. It was a longsword that Zheng had obtained from the Sword Clan. True to its name, the Sword Clan was obsessed with swordsmanship, and their extraordinary sword-refining skills immediately attracted Sword Chen's attention. "Can you give this sword to me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Take anything you like," Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>Under the mop of disheveled hair, a childlike smile appeared on Sword Chen's face. For Zheng, it was hard to digest that a sword practitioner could be this captivated by a sword.</p>

  <p>"Do I have to refine all of them?" Zheng asked, changing the subject.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen nodded. "Let me help you refine these swords. When you insert them into the Sea of Meditation, you'll only need to activate them!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he reached out and patted the long table.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>All of the longswords jumped up from the table.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's right hand swiftly swept past them, leaving a mark the size of a thumb on the handle of each sword.</p>

  <p>In less than half a minute, Sword Chen had finished the preparation work.</p>

  <p>He then said to Zheng, "Take these swords and follow me into the dark water."</p>

  <p>"Do we still have to enter the dark water?" Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had a general idea of the Sea of Meditation after Sword Chen's explanation, the force of primitive fear and the unknown hidden in the dark water still made Zheng feel uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's hesitant expression, Sword Chen laughed. "Don't worry. We are already in the depths of the Sea of Meditation."</p>

  <p>"The depths of the Sea of Meditation? Won't there be the unknown here?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen simply smiled. "In the Sea of Meditation, the unknown are all over the place," he answered mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Then what are we going to do?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"We will have to rely on this, of course," Sword Chen replied, taking out a triangular golden object.</p>

  <p>As Sword Chen swept his fingers over the surface of the golden object, it started to burn with a dazzling golden light that spread to the whole bubble.</p>

  <p>The surface of Zheng's and Sword Chen's bodies seemed to be coated with a layer of dazzling golden powder as well.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng felt some warmth from the golden object.</p>

  <p>"This warm current... I've felt it before," Zheng said as he studied the golden object in Sword Chen's hand.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen nodded. "Before, when your mind was suppressed by fear, I used the Scorching Gold to help you drive away the fear. We wouldn't need it if we were going to the upper part of the Sea of Meditation, but this time, we're going to set up the sword array in the depths of the sea, so we'll certainly need this thing."</p>

  <p>The Scorching Gold was a magical object that had come into existence in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the Sea of Meditation was filled with some extremely powerful unknown things that even the strongest fiends wouldn't be able to survive against.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the unknown feared the light that the Scorching Gold gave off.</p>

  <p>As long as the light of the Scorching Gold didn't go out, it wouldn't be a problem for warriors who were under the protection of the light to roam the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Holding the Scorching Gold in his hand, Sword Chen stepped out of the bubble.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly stretched out his hand and stroked the long table, recalling all the swords that had been refined by Sword Chen into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Plop, plop...</p>

  <p>Zheng followed Sword Chen and sank into the thick dark water again.</p>

  <p>Before, when Zheng had descended, he hadn't been able to see anything.</p>

  <p>But this time, he could see each and every detail; the Scorching Gold in Sword Chen's hand was emitting a golden light that illuminated the area ten feet around!</p>

  <p>"Make sure that you are always under the cover of the golden light from the Scorching Gold. These unknown things are very sensitive and will slowly gather around you. The moment you are outside the golden light's protection, they will attack together!" Sword Chen warned him.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that these unknown things have no forms? Then how do you know they will attack?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, Sword Chen replied, "There was a time when I was chased by a fiend in the Sea of Meditation. After his Scorching Gold burned out and the golden light disappeared, the unknown things came over..."</p>

  <p>Every time Sword Chen recalled this incident, his heart would flutter with fear. There was no doubt that even the fiends would be extremely afraid of the unknown things.</p>

  <p>As they were speaking, Zheng suddenly felt a surge of power coming from beside him. Both of them turned their heads at the same time. It seemed that there were many huge things slowly approaching them from the distance...</p>
