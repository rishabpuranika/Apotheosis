  <p>
</p>

  <p>The white jade staircase was about twenty feet wide. From the foot of this majestic mountain, there were hundreds of thousands of steps cut into the mountain to the summit.</p>

  <p>Although flying was prohibited, the speed maintained by this group of ten wasn't slow either.</p>

  <p>With the white-clothed woman's warning, the ten of them had lowered their vigilance quite a bit.</p>

  <p>After all, in this supreme world, these ten people were basically all ranked in the top thousand, while in the entire Illusion Battlefield, they were ranked in the top hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>No one had earned more confidence that they would be able to defeat the rest of the group in one go. Not to mention that the woman in white robes had even told them that they would be awarded ten million Illusion Points in the Hall of Causality. They would clearly face no obstacles or danger here.</p>

  <p>Along the way, the white-clothed woman took the lead with Luo Luo Zheng following closely behind. The other martial artists maintained a measured distance and made the ascent at a steady pace. Behind them, the short martial artist from the human race brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>After tirelessly climbing for five minutes, the group stopped in front of a large hall set half way into the mountain. The staircase extended through the hall, and connected to the stairs at the back. If they wanted to continue climbing, they would have to pass through this hall.</p>

  <p>This hall was entirely white and had a magnificent appearance. It was unknown what material was used to construct it, but there were no signs or warnings on the outside wall.</p>

  <p>Among the ten, this was the second time that the woman in white had entered the Hall of Causality. None of the rest of the group had done so before. The eyes of the crowd were fixed on the woman in white, who boldly led them.</p>

  <p>The woman in white smiled and said, "This is the first Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>It isn't too difficult to pass through. Everyone can enter now."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. Since he had already spent five million Illusion Points, he didn't hesitate anymore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone followed behind Luo Luo Zheng and walked into the hall.</p>

  <p>There was nothing inside, the hall was empty.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists present had already explored several mystic places within the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>A sense of caution rose in everyone's heart in the face of this apparently empty building, including Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was just like when he had entered the top of the Sacred Ailanthus, although its surroundings were quiet, it had actually been extremely dangerous. If he had been like any other martial artist who was careless, he would have perished immediately.</p>

  <p>But even someone as strong as Luo Luo Zheng had no idea of how to deal with the pile of small skulls ravenously chasing behind him!</p>

  <p>Seeing how cautious everyone was, the woman in white smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Don't be too nervous. This is the first Hall of Causality. It won't be too difficult."</p>

  <p>"What's in the Hall of Causality?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>The woman in white smiled and said, "As the name implies, the rules of the heavens are used as a method of attack in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Every attack contains the Law of Causality!"</p>

  <p>Although the woman in white looked relaxed, her words still caused everyone's expression to change slightly and the hair on the backs of their necks rose in response to unspoken threats.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Any method that involved the Law of Causality was a mid-ranking rule or even a top-ranking rule in the universe.</p>

  <p>Why were supreme divine weapons so powerful? That was why! The Law of Causality contained in them was the reason.</p>

  <p>When it came to the methods related to the Law of Causality, they were all difficult to oppose. For instance, when a Supreme Lord released the highest power of the Law of Causality, which was carried in the Heavenly Destiny, the power was strong enough to instantly kill all ten people present. They wondered how this woman in white could still laugh under such a situation.</p>

  <p>"Then what's the danger in this first Hall of Causality?" the warrior in the round hat asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The woman in white shook her head and said, "It seems as if the danger is different every time. I'm not sure either, but I know that the level of difficulty of the first Hall of Causality is not that high. As long as you are careful, you can all pass here."</p>

  <p>When the woman in white saw the hesitation on everyone's faces, she turned and entered further into the hall as example. She looked behind her and saw that the nine people behind her, including Luo Luo Zheng, did not follow her at all.</p>

  <p>These warriors didn't easily trust in others at all. She felt like she was an idiot, who was being used by them to explore the way ahead before they would risk following.</p>

  <p>When the woman in white took a few steps forward, a mysterious rune appeared on the left wall of the Hall of Causality. The center of the rune was carved with a strange figure, and from the mouth of the figure, a white light shone brightly. After this light appeared, it flew out of the wall and headed at an incredible speed towards the woman in white!</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Luo Luo Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>They had indeed been a bit unkind to let a woman lead and explore the way. But her earlier words about the Law of Causality, which was involved in all the attacks, still frightened the group. Even Luo Luo Zheng had become more wary.</p>

  <p>This ray of light looked ordinary, but in reality, it contained a killing intent. Luo Luo Zheng did not fully understand the profound mysteries contained within this light.</p>

  <p>Though, at the very least, Luo Luo Zheng was certain that he would die if he was pierced by this white light, even though he wasn't sure of the rules of causality that were contained within it.</p>

  <p>There was also a hint of surprise and concern in everyone's eyes!</p>

  <p>What the hell was this Hall of Causality? Why was such a terrifying attack being used from the very start?</p>

  <p>The woman in white was extremely calm and she simply took a step back. As she watched the white ray of light pass within a foot before her, another mysterious rune appeared on the opposite side of the wall in the hall. Within the rune was a drawing of a strange animal, and the light immediately entered the sketch's mouth and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"As I've said, the first Hall of Causality isn't too difficult. As long as we're careful, we'll be able to pass without any obstructions," the woman in white said, her voice faintly betraying some contempt for the nine warriors who had waited behind her.</p>

  <p>Then she took a few more steps, and another white light appeared on one side of the wall, and sped across the hall and into the other wall.</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Luo Zheng and the others also took large strides forward and cautiously followed behind the woman in white.</p>

  <p>The trials of the first Hall of Causality truly weren't that hard, and the warriors all seemed somewhat shamefaced at not being brave enough.</p>

  <p>For these martial artists, even if there were hundreds of beams of light in the hall, as long as they were given enough space, they would be able to freely run a gauntlet of them!</p>

  <p>However, this light still proved a potential threat to everyone.</p>

  <p>It was like someone walking on the spot as if he was walking on flat ground. If he were to be placed a hundred meters high into the air, although there was a wide path in front of him, he would still slow down due to some misgivings. The instinct of self-preservation was very strong in everyone, and this had made the warriors hesitate.</p>

  <p>Such was the mindset of many warriors at the moment. They had come so far, and didn't want to fail now.</p>

  <p>Every ten feet within the great hall, they would encounter a white light.</p>

  <p>And as the group continued forward, the speed of the white light beams that passed by became faster and faster.</p>

  <p>In terms of speed, this was relative!</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Luo Luo Zheng and the other warriors, the speed of the white light wasn't much faster than that of a snail.</p>

  <p>After all, with their own incredible speeds, they might not even have needed the time for a single breath to completely traverse the Hall of Causality at full speed.</p>

  <p>However, the white light gave them a sense of fear, and they did not dare to walk rashly. Their eyes followed the rhythm of the light and waited until it passed by before taking another step forward.</p>

  <p>The speed and frequency of each ray of light was not same.</p>

  <p>The further they went into the hall, the greater the speed at which the light came out.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the light would suddenly cross the hall, stop in the middle of the space for a moment, and then unpredictably accelerate to the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the light would rush from one side of the hall to the other at a speed that the group could not even see clearly. It would wait for a few seconds before repeating itself.</p>

  <p>These beams of light could be seen moving around in regular patterns.</p>

  <p>To these martial artists, this was just a small trick. As they became more familiar with the patterns of the light, their minds became more relaxed and their speed picked up, becoming faster.</p>

  <p>"We still have another hundred feet before we pass through this hall," the woman in white said. She seemed to have become the undisputed leader of this group.</p>

  <p>"What's the reward for passing through the first hall?" the ogre martial artist asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll know once we get there," the woman in white said with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly stopped in his tracks. He looked at the white light that passed close by him, and once again had the idea of throwing off the skulls behind him.</p>

  <p>'Would this white light be able to destroy those small skulls?'</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng once again took out a small skull from behind him. Carefully holding the bottom of the skull with his hand, he placed it on the track of the white ray of light.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The white beam of light suddenly shot out and instantly struck the small skull!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng instantly felt an enormous power in his hand, the strength of which far exceeded Luo Zheng's imagination! It was probably many times more powerful than the power that Luo Luo Zheng had lit up with all his dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed drastically, and he immediately let go of the skull!</p>

  <p>He witnessed the white ray of light being deflected away by the small skull, heading towards the ceiling of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>

  <p>Other than the white ray of light ricocheting in all directions, the black skull was also bouncing up and down at an extremely fast speed in this Hall of Causality!</p>
