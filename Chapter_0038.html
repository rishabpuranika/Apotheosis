</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked by the stone slab, his jade pendant slowly turned from green to blood-red.</p>

  <p>A big smirk appeared on his face as Zheng turned and waved his jade pendant at the four men behind him.</p>

  <p>The four men following Zheng were enraged when they saw his victorious smile.</p>

  <p>Before the start of the initial exam, someone gave them the task of dealing with a boy at the organ refining level.</p>

  <p>As the men were more powerful, they had scoffed at the mission. They believed that dealing with a person at such a low level was beneath them.</p>

  <p>They had assumed that they would be able to defeat Zheng. However, they did not expect that he would be able to escape. Moreover, Zheng dared to provoke them by being openly triumphant. How dare he behave like that?</p>

  <p>The four men fumed at the humiliation.</p>

  <p>The scholar-like man glared viciously at Zheng as he spoke, "Guys, let's terminate this boy by any means necessary!"</p>

  <p>"He passed the initial exam, so killing him in front of the examiners may be too..." The strongest of the four men grunted in response. On his face was an expression that conveyed his hesitance.</p>

  <p>The scholar-like man was furious. "Billy said that he could deal with any consequence. This boy is not a native of the Imperial Capital. He doesn't have a high social background either. Even if we kill him, who will take revenge on us on his behalf?"</p>

  <p>The other three men glanced at each other when they heard the scholar-like man's explanation. What he said seemed to assuage their fears.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, the gang acted on the resentment they were feeling. In a heartbeat, they lunged at Zheng. Their expressions conveyed that they were going to rip him to shreds.</p>

  <p>Zheng was pleased to see their reaction. In fact, he had deliberately enraged the four men.</p>

  <p>At the moment, there were two ways of improving his power rapidly. The first was to let the black fire swallow many mysterious weapons in order to light up the dragon scales. But Zheng had found it difficult to procure the many mysterious weapons it would take to do it.</p>

  <p>The second way was to let other people beat him. In receiving such a beating, the warm currents would be produced and they, in turn, would remove impurities in his viscera.</p>

  <p>Each member of this gang had the strength of cultivators at the marrow refining level. And so their attacks were just moderate in degree for Zheng.</p>

  <p>If cultivators at a lower level were to beat him, there would be no effect.</p>

  <p>Equally, if a cultivator at half of a step into the nature level was to beat him, the force might be too strong to bear, and Zheng might even be killed. Thus, these four men could be regarded as the perfect 'blacksmith' for Zheng.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why Zheng had turned the jade pendant red and then immediately implemented his plan to provoke them.</p>

  <p>Seeing the four men rushing toward him, Zheng turned around and ran forward. Aside from angering the four men, Zheng wanted to use this opportunity to stay on the path as a test to see how much pressure he could actually withstand.</p>

  <p>After running 20 miles, Zheng found the pressure had increased from 2, 000 to 4, 000 pounds. It was now twice as high as it had been a moment ago!</p>

  <p>Under such high pressure, he felt as though his whole body was being dragged to the ground by a great force. If it had not been for his great strength, his body would have collapsed under the weight.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the four men chasing him had also slowed due to the pressure.</p>

  <p>For a bystander, the scene would have been entertaining to watch.</p>

  <p>Zheng was running slowly, and four men were pursuing him equally slowly. It appeared as though someone had put on a slow-motion film.</p>

  <p>Zheng could have run faster, as so far, he had only used his strength. He hadn't as yet, used the power of the two dragon scales. He was sure that he could be twice as fast had he employed his hidden powers.</p>

  <p>However, he was motivated to give the four men an opportunity to catch him. After all, his body would only undergo further refinement if they were able to beat him.</p>

  <p>The scholar-like man was the first to catch Zheng. As soon as he was within striking distance of Zheng, he blustered, "I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!" He used all his strength to make eight successive palm-strikes. Under the pressure of 4, 000 pounds, even though he was at the marrow refining level, the man was still out of breath from the effort.</p>

  <p>The man's palm connected with Zheng's back. Not only did the force of the impact push Zheng forward, but it also helped release the warm currents. Zheng moaned with satisfaction when he felt the warm currents remove impurities in his body.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng had absorbed the warm currents, the rest of the men had caught up to him.</p>

  <p>"Frost Wolf Fist!"</p>

  <p>"Bursting Elbow Strike!"</p>

  <p>"Vigorous Collapsing Fist!"</p>

  <p>The four men attacked Zheng; each strike landing on his back and pushing him forward. The impurities in Zheng's body mixed with sweat and were released from his skin at an incredible rate. The result was a dark-red mixture that was being exuded.</p>

  <p>The more the four men attacked Zheng, the more upset they became.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body seemed unusually firm! Even the body refiner of the Ogre race did not have such a strong body.</p>
