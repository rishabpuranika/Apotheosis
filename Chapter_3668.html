<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These soldiers had already understood that the intruders were extremely powerful, and that the Dragon Cliff could not resist them.</p>

  <p>Patton knew this well, which was why he had asked his men to leave first.</p>

  <p>They could guard the seven mountains if they remained alive.</p>

  <p>But none of the soldiers was willing to retreat. Patton ignored their determination. What had to be done, had to be done.</p>

  <p>"Please kill us if you don't want us to stay!" the strapping man said firmly.</p>

  <p>Patton looked at them, stunned. After a long time, he said, "Walker, you need to go to destroy the transmission array. You can all leave through the transmission array before it is destroyed. I'm letting you go back because then you can guard the seven mountains. I'm not going to let you become deserters!"</p>

  <p>Everyone knew this, but no one wanted to leave. They didn't have a way back if Walker destroyed the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Some distance away, an old man in white approached them, a black rod perched on his shoulder. He shouted, his voice hoarse, "I've heard that the person guarding the Dragon Cliff is Patton, a talent of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Are you Patton?"</p>

  <p>Patton unsheathed the three-foot-long sword in his hand. The red light on the Dragon Cliff flickered, and the sharp radiance of the Bloody Sword Array appeared. "Yes. What is it to you?"</p>

  <p>"We are humans. There is no need for us to fight each other. The Bearing race is in need of powerful warriors. If you are willing to pledge allegiance to our race, you can become immortal and own an eternal life!" the old man said.</p>

  <p>Patton understood what the Bearing race was after. Offering the eternal life was indeed a good incentive but nothing could persuade Patton to pledge allegiance to the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>He sneered, "Nonsense! Our Taiyi Heaven Palace is the most orthodox human force in the world. How can we join you?"</p>

  <p>The old man didn't think he could persuade Patton. He sighed and looked at the Bloody Sword Array that was wrapped around the Dragon Cliff. Then he stretched out his finger, and tapped lightly on it. "Pass through the middle line. I can break the array easily."</p>

  <p>About fifteen minutes later, the old man came upon the broken transmission array that lay behind the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"This is completely destroyed. Even if it's repaired, it cannot build an accurate space channel," he said.</p>

  <p>Beside him stood a masked man, his skin dark green. He said rather stoically, "We can advance once we enter the Bloom Divine Province. It doesn't matter if we have to spend a longer time."</p>

  <p>"Let's go," another man said, passing through the transmission array and flying on forward.</p>

  <p>After dozens of people had flown away, the old man shook the fishing rod on his shoulder. Patton's head was hanging at the front of the fishing rod.</p>

  <p>His head had been cut off, his handsome face still scrunched with malice.</p>

  <p>He stared at the old man ferociously.</p>

  <p>"I cracked the array fast enough, but you still killed three of my people with a sword and a broken array," the old man said with a sigh. "Young people nowadays can't be underestimated."</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he took a step forward and jumped.</p>

  <p>Patton's head was now hanging on the fish line, floating behind him.</p>

  <p>After the old man caught up with the team, a tall, thin man asked, "There are seven mountains in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but our goal should be the Taiyi Mountain, right?"</p>

  <p>The old man nodded. "The biggest trouble of the Taiyi Heaven Palace is Eastern Emperor Taiyi. If he breaks free from the shackles and wakes up, all of us will die."</p>

  <p>"We'd better kill him first, since he's trapped on the Other Shore," the tall, thin man said.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I will lead my men to attack the Phoenix Palace of the Taiyi Mountain," said the old man.</p>

  <p>There were many arrays in the Taiyi Mountain, and even a strong warrior couldn't break through them easily.</p>

  <p>But this old man was a super-normal talent of the Bearing race. His talent involved breaking arrays. There was no array in the world that he couldn't break.</p>

  <p>Gethin had handed over most of the information about the Taiyi Mountain to the old man. He knew the Taiyi Mountain very well, causing him to believe that attacking it wouldn't be too difficult.</p>

  <p>But since the transmission array broke, they had to use the slow way? flying.</p>

  <p>Soon after they entered the Bloom Divine Province, they found the Ethereal Dragon City in the southwest.</p>

  <p>There were also people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace guarding the Ethereal Dragon City. But they weren't skilled enough to resist an attack from these masters of the Bearing race. They were all killed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Some people had wanted to destroy the transmission array in the Ethereal Dragon City again, but their efforts had been in vain.</p>

  <p>After they passed through the transmission array, the members of the Bearing race reached a mountain city. They then passed through the transmission array once again, following which they reached the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The transmission array of the Dragon City lay outside the Dragon Shadow Pavilion, guarded by several Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>During the war, the entire Bloom Divine Province remained heavily guarded, and all the arrays of various sizes in the Taiyi Mountain were activated. Even so, the Oneness Guards had never dreamed that these people would enter the Dragon City through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>They were stunned to see the old man and the other members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Show me the Sword Card of the Taiyi Heaven Palace!" one of the Oneness Guards shouted.</p>

  <p>Before he could finish speaking, a thin fish line was wrapped around his throat. The old man's arm trembled, and with one yank, the Oneness Guard had been beheaded.</p>

  <p>The other Oneness Guards were alarmed. Some screamed, some shouted out warnings, some took out their Other Shore Tokens to fight, and some chose to escape.</p>

  <p id="top_20">But it didn't matter what these Oneness Guards did or what choice they made, it was all meaningless in the face of these powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race were casual in their moves but many of the Oneness Guards had disintegrated into pieces.</p>

  <p>The death of these Oneness Guards alarmed more people.</p>

  <p>Sellers who guarded the Sword Tower, Calum who guarded the Dragon Path, and other powerful warriors stationed in the Dragon City swung into action.</p>

  <p>These warriors were much stronger than the Oneness Guards. But since the members from the Bearing race were as powerful as Qiu Yinhe, they couldn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>In the next five minutes, many people in the whole Dragon City were massacred and the city was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The old man's wrinkled face looked bored. He looked up at the Taiyi Mountain. The mountain's protecting arrays had already been activated.</p>

  <p>"I'd prefer to break the arrays as against killing," he said, carrying the fishing rod to the Dragon Path.</p>

  <p>Blazing flames shot up everywhere in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The Truth Library, the Best Swords Shop, and other places were all now burning.</p>

  <p>Those warriors of the Bearing race slaughtered people and burned the Dragon City before flying into the air and following the old man.</p>

  <p>The old man climbed up the mountain, breaking all the arrays on the way.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the extraordinary power of the various strange arrays on the Taiyi Mountain, he could figure out their essence and easily break them.</p>

  <p>He climbed to the top of the Dragon Path in less than three hours.</p>

  <p>He led the crowd, but did not move towards the three sword sects. They had no interest in either the Heart Flow Sect or the Killing Sword Sect.</p>
