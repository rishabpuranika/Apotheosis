<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All those years back, Simon had been chased ruthlessly by many martial artists. He had been running the whole time, hiding in the Dreamy Swampland and cultivating. There he had grabbed many great opportunities, and he had even obtained two fierce beasts, which were as powerful as the martial artists at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Simon didn't trust the other warriors at all. In comparison, he felt that beasts were more trustworthy than humans.</p>

  <p>Gong hesitated for a moment. In fact, as a martial artist of the divine kingdom, there was no difference between the Holy Maiden and him. With their experience, they could definitely look down on a great number of martial artists from the Central Region. However, Gong was not as foolish as the prince of the divine kingdom. If he did not compromise in this situation, it was clear that he would suffer a loss.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I swear with my warrior spirit!" Gong said through clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>With the deal finalized, Simon chuckled and pointed at the Holy Maiden, shooting a white ray of light towards her.</p>

  <p>The light continued to climb up along the Holy Maiden's clothes, finally spreading over her head. The dark cloud there in which black lightning shone got cleansed instantly.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden finally let out a sigh of relief and then stared fiercely at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng ignored her fury. He sat on the disc and continued to watch the next person throw the dice.</p>

  <p>A white-haired elder from the Mysterious Luna Hall rolled a three. When the black disc appeared, everyone present offered a silent prayer. Although the elder had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he wouldn't be able to bear this severe punishment.</p>

  <p>The elder was hesitant. Gritting his teeth, he stepped onto the black disc.</p>

  <p>However, this was a different disc because there was a white line on it.</p>

  <p>Just as the elder was about to step on it, a voice commanded, "You can kill anyone here."</p>

  <p>The mood in the crowd immediately changed as they heard this announcement.</p>

  <p>They had learned how powerful the immortal could be. If the elder followed the rules and chose someone, none of them would be able to resist the immortal's strength.</p>

  <p>The white-haired elder let out a long sigh of relief, his face revealing his excitement. "Ha-ha. I didn't think I would have the chance to kill someone!</p>

  <p>Who should I kill?" he wondered out loud, scratching his chin.</p>

  <p>Eddie, Simon and other Life and Death Realm warriors were nervous wrecks.</p>

  <p>As they had reached the Life and Death Realm, their lives and deaths were in their own hands, but now, the white-haired elder could kill one of them, so their fear was understandable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie, on the contrary, weren't nervous at all. There was no enmity between them and the elder, so it was unlikely that they would get picked.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was curious to know why Elderly Luna's face was deathly pale. An elder of his own sect drew the killing card. Why was he so afraid?</p>

  <p>Could it be that…</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng pondered this, the elder suddenly turned around and jeered, "I want to kill Elderly Luna!"</p>

  <p>"You, you have gone too far!" Elderly Luna's face twisted in anger. A cyan-colored protective life vitality began to revolve around his body, tightly winding itself around him for protection.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, a ray of grey light shot out from the dice and pierced Elderly Luna's body. The light seemed to be unstoppable. Elderly Luna's eyes grew bigger and his stomach started bulging out even though he was a thin man.</p>

  <p>The next scene was even more terrifying. His head disappeared completely, and then his torso and his four limbs. It was as if an invisible hand was slowly wiping him out like he was a mere drawing.</p>

  <p>Soon, the nine-hundred-year-old man, who was dozens of years away from becoming an Ancient Tycoon, was slowly wiped out just like that!</p>

  <p>Tears streamed down the white-haired elder's face. "I've finally killed you, ha-ha!" he said joyously.</p>

  <p>"Elder Luo Zheng, I didn't think that you'd really be able to do it!" The other elders of the Mysterious Luna Hall were also overjoyed and they all started congratulating Elder Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>People from the other sects could not help but shake their heads. What evil deeds had Elderly Luna committed in his sect to make the elders feel this way about him?</p>

  <p>Among the fourth-grade sects, the Mysterious Luna Hall was considered the most mysterious. It was not clear why these elders hated Elderly Luna so much. The hatred within their sect naturally had nothing to do with the outsiders.</p>

  <p>However, realizing that they could be killed by someone like that, the Life and Death Realm warriors all felt a sense of panic, because it was not something they could withstand.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the beam of light rotated and once again pointed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled slightly and casually waved his hand. The shadow of his fist appeared on the dice, and after the dice rolled twice, it stopped at six.</p>

  <p>"It seems that my luck has improved," Luo Zheng smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Six discs appeared, and a yellow light flashed from the last disc.</p>

  <p>"Throw the dice again!"</p>

  <p>"Six!"</p>

  <p>"Throw it again!"</p>

  <p>"Six!".</p>

  <p>In this way, Luo Zheng progressed surely and steadily. The crowd was left speechless. Eddie's face darkened. Why was this guy so lucky?</p>

  <p>It was just as the cyan dragon had predicted. Luck heralded the path that Luo Zheng would take in this life.</p>

  <p>Back then, he was trapped in the Luo Family, but after leaving the family, he had made great progress. From a humble outer disciple, he rose rapidly to be the strongest warrior at Drizzle Peak and Cloud Sect. Now, with his knowledge and expertise, no disciple of Cloud Hall could compare with him.</p>

  <p>This was his fate: to lead the world of chaos!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng caught up with Ning Yudie after throwing the dice a few times, and even went a few steps ahead of her. At this moment, the last disk in front of him was glowing with a green light, and inside the green light were two eyes.</p>

  <p>Green color shouldn't mean punishment. Earlier, Ning Yudie had won a fantastic prize— a lifespan of five hundred years!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and stepped on the green disc.</p>

  <p>"Eye Washing."</p>

  <p>A voice proclaimed. A silhouette of a large tree suddenly appeared in the sky just above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Drops of emerald green sap dripped from the tree and rolled down towards his eyes.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Central Region were confused.</p>

  <p>"Will the sap wash his eyes? What is this sap?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Hope it won't ruin his eyes."</p>

  <p>"It's probably not as good as the five-hundred-year lifespan that Ning Yudie got."</p>

  <p>All the warriors from the Central Region didn't know what was going on, but those from the divine kingdoms had figured it out.</p>

  <p>Gong was shocked when he saw the image of the tree. "This is the legendary divine tree of the Wood Divine Kingdom! Oh my god! How could he use the sap of the divine tree to wash his eyes? What a waste!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden and the prince of the divine kingdom also stared blankly at the scene unfolding before them. The prince turned his head and asked,</p>

  <p>"Gong, are you sure this is the divine tree?"</p>

  <p>Gong nodded and said, "Yes! I'm pretty sure! The divine tree appears once every five hundred years, and every time it appears, a drop of its sap will fall from the branch. The Wood Divine Kingdom has accumulated and constantly consumed the sap for more than ten thousand years, so now it only has a dozen drops."</p>

  <p>On hearing this, the other warriors were stunned.</p>

  <p>The Wood Divine Kingdom had only about ten drops of the divine tree's sap. But Luo Zheng had just washed his eyes with dozens of drops.</p>

  <p>The emerald green sap flowed unceasingly into Zheng's eyes, creating an icy and comfortable feeling within him.</p>

  <p>As the sap slowly seeped in, he could feel that a kind of special energy bubbling up in his eyes, and the rest of the sap slowly drained out of his eyes and dripped into the abyss.</p>

  <p>The corner of Gong's mouth twitched at this scene. It was truly an enormous waste.</p>

  <p>The Wood Divine Kingdom collected the sap to make pills or to directly swallow them. They would never waste a single drop. However, after washing his eyes, Luo Zheng actually allowed the sap to flow out and fall into the abyss.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that Luo Zheng was his enemy, he would have reprimanded him for wasting something so precious.</p>

  <p>After all the sap had flowed out, Zheng's tightly shut eyes slowly opened.</p>

  <p>Now there was a hint of green in his pupils.</p>
