<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1719 Killed Nine Seconds Later </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Some gamblers in the universe had bet on Zheng. They were thrilled to win the riches out of the blue.</p>

  <p>However, be it the losers, the winners, or the dealers, none of them knew that this was going to be their very last carnival.</p>

  <p>It was the last peaceful period for the martial artists of the one hundred thousand supreme worlds. Soon, the entire universe would fall into panic and crisis.</p>

  <p>"Aye! This battle is indeed exciting!"</p>

  <p>"Can a world lord break Zheng's sword strike?"</p>

  <p>"Hah! You must be joking! In the end, Zheng is only a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. It is impossible for him to defeat a world lord who is three realms higher."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! However, to be honest, the idea that this sword strike could kill a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior is truly unthinkable! Zheng is only at the Soul Sea Realm!"</p>

  <p>After Zheng won the battle with Tianming, the two of them sat on their stones with their eyes closed in meditation.</p>

  <p>They did it to recover their life vitality or chaotic energy and also calm their minds.</p>

  <p>In this sort of battle, where one's capability was used to the limits, this was the most convenient way to receive some epiphany.</p>

  <p>Before this, although Tianming's sword attack had not been able to block Zheng's, which was almost like a True God's, it had still been a welcome boost to his mental state.</p>

  <p>After he absorbed some life vitality jades, he sank into deep thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng's recovery was relatively troublesome.</p>

  <p>Chaotic energy was far more solid than life vitality. Although Zheng had absorbed a great deal of life vitality jades and transformed the life vitality into chaotic energy, it was like a drop of water in a bucket.</p>

  <p>In fact, because of the characteristics of chaotic energy, it could completely devour all living things and transform them into chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But now that Zheng was bound to the stone, it was unsuitable for him to do so.</p>

  <p>He had used up nearly half of his life vitality jades and only restored about one fifth of his chaotic sea. If nothing went wrong, there would occur a final battle for him.</p>

  <p>That would depend on the outcome of Nathan and Kurt's battle.</p>

  <p>If Nathan defeated Kurt, he would have to face Zheng and compete for first place in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Nathan lost to Kurt, he would have to fight Tianming for the second place. Regardless of Nathan's victory or defeat in his battle against Tianming, Zheng would immediately be promoted to first position.</p>

  <p>"However it ends, I still need to replenish my chaotic energy," Zheng murmured. His face revealed some distress. "What exactly is that cross crystal?"</p>

  <p>After defeating Tianming, the crystal had disappeared from Zheng's inner world in a flash.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy that had formed the round plate also scattered away.</p>

  <p>It was as if the crystal had never even been there. It brought Zheng victory and at the same time filled his head with innumerable doubts.</p>

  <p>Zheng had felt the aura coming from his body change dramatically. The power contained within the crystal was beyond the limitations of the rules of the universe. Zheng, however, was unable to control the crystal. It appeared in an instant, and disappeared just as quickly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>He felt the boundless vitality between heaven and earth gush down from above his head.</p>

  <p>The vitality between heaven and earth was extremely dense. It flowed down from the top of Zheng's head and spread through his veins. Finally, like a river gathering in the ocean, it flowed into his inner world to eventually be devoured by the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>"Gods! So much vitality between heaven and earth!" he exclaimed silently.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head and looked up. The thick clouds in the sky were quietly moving. He did not see anything suspicious.</p>

  <p>"It must be her," he said, a mysterious smile playing on his lips.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Kurt and Nathan stepped onto the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Their stones landed in very strange positions.</p>

  <p>The black stone on the sun position had been captured. At this moment, the Go game was about to come to an end.</p>

  <p>As for Nathan's white stone, it had returned to the sun position.</p>

  <p>A wide smile blossomed on Nathan's face when he saw where his stone was positioned.</p>

  <p>To him, this was a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>The situation on the board was simply too complicated. Even Nathan, who was proficient in the game of Go, was unable to see through this move.</p>

  <p>Previously, many people proficient in Go game thought that the player who played the game was very weak.</p>

  <p>But this was a great turning point. It directly revived the entire situation of the white stones and also changed Nathan's fate.</p>

  <p>"I will still win." Nathan, who was standing on the Heaven Earth Board, had a proud expression on his face. His belief was stronger than it had ever been.</p>

  <p>Only by having faith in himself could he go further. Nathan was absolutely confident of it.</p>

  <p>However, this confidence was shattered at once when he saw the fight between Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>The talents of the Thoughtless Minds represented the entire universe's talents, and Nathan was almost invincible among the lot.</p>

  <p>Among the top three hundred warriors, he had once regarded Lawson as his greatest opponent. He was simply unafraid of any opponent whom he had once defeated.</p>

  <p>First place was almost within his reach.</p>

  <p>But just now, when he saw Zheng and Tianming exchange blows, his state of mind experienced great turmoil.</p>

  <p>Where did these two warriors come from? Why were they so strong?</p>

  <p>Nathan feared losing his confidence the most.</p>

  <p>To him, confidence was equal to strength.</p>

  <p>What was most despicable was that when the two of them fought, they messed with the stones on the board, yet the mysterious woman did not recover the stones. The entire board was in disarray. He was not sure if this game of Go could still be used to deduce the future of the universe.</p>

  <p>If he could not rely on others, he could only rely on himself.</p>

  <p>After defeating Kurt, he should have a face-off with Zheng. After that, Kurt would only be able to compete for fourth place with Shania. Nathan was hoping that the mysterious woman would carefully finish the last few steps of the game.</p>

  <p>However, Kurt's strength could not be underestimated either.</p>

  <p>None among the top five— Shania, Kurt, Nathan, Tianming and Zheng— could be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Nathan could not help but sigh. 'Why are all of them such mighty warriors? Nevertheless, I'll be the winner.'</p>

  <p>Kurt's face was as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>Nathan had not revealed his trump card, but the title of the No.1 Godly Genius was certainly not so easy to obtain.</p>

  <p>When Nathan stepped onto the Heaven Earth Board, Kurt raised the staff in his hand.</p>

  <p>The nine rings on the staff had already been cut up by Tianming. As the staff was raised, a blood-like smell spread.</p>

  <p>"Asura!"</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Kurt, who had been looking rather friendly, now had a ferocious gleam in his eyes. It was as if he was an inhuman beast. His entire body had grown by half, and his face held a violent expression.</p>

  <p>Nathan was aware that Kurt was much more powerful than his previous opponents. It would be impossible for him to defeat Kurt easily.</p>

  <p>Nathan finally became serious. It was the first time he was weighing his options in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>He took out a fiery red spear from his Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>"Nathan has a weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Did he use any weapon before?"</p>

  <p>"Who said that he couldn't use his weapon?"</p>

  <p>Nathan and Tianming were different. Tianming always carried a sword on his back and seldom used it, so people naturally questioned it. At the same time, they regarded it as him putting on an act.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan did not reveal his weapon. His palm strike was already so sharp that people had thought that he would go up against all his opponents with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists practiced special cultivation methods, such as the specialized palm and fist techniques. It was not strange for them not to use a weapon.</p>

  <p>Thus, Nathan taking out the spear was rather puzzling.</p>

  <p>The moment he took out his spear, Kurt, calm as ever, stepped on a stone and pushed it with a tremendous force. He had attacked first.</p>

  <p>"The little monk is no longer calm!"</p>

  <p>"He is doomed. In a battle like this, whoever gets anxious first will lose."</p>

  <p>"That might not be the case. Who knows, maybe Nathan is weaker."</p>

  <p>Amidst the discussion of the crowd, Kurt rushed toward Nathan, who was holding his spear high.</p>

  <p>During this rapid sprint, Kurt's figure suddenly stopped. He stopped so suddenly that even the martial artists watching the painting failed to keep up.</p>

  <p>Kurt, who had come to a halt, suddenly retreated by over a hundred feet before changing his angle to sprint ahead. Then, he came to a stop once again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nathan only held a spear in his hand as he faced Kurt.</p>

  <p>If Kurt changed his angle, Nathan only moved slightly and adjusted the direction of his spear. Hints of confidence and indifference hung on his face.</p>

  <p>Kurt was able to foresee with the Constellation Eyes.</p>

  <p>He adjusted his position more than ten times. No matter which way he rushed, he foresaw a scene that would happen nine seconds later with the help of Constellation Eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw the scene of him getting killed by Nathan.</p>
