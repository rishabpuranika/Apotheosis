<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In all the four kingdoms, for a martial artist at the Virtual Tribulation Realm to be able to annihilate another warrior at the Life and Death Realm was only something from the historical legends. It wasn't just any normal occurrence. For that to happen was groundbreaking.</p>

  <p>Even Master Abraham could've never done such a thing.</p>

  <p>So when he heard Master Wallace's words, he became deeply interested in Luo Zheng. At such a young age, he already possessed unbelievable strength.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, it was because of the secret inheritance of the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>"You must not worry, Abraham. I don't plan on deceiving you. When have I ever done such insolence? I believe myself to be trustworthy."</p>

  <p>Master Wallace suddenly rose to a higher height after his statement. He took a sharp breath as he looked onto the Oracle City, facing it head-on. A steady stream of energy gathered around him, and the sky overflowed out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Then, with all his might, he roared, "Luo Zheng Luo!  Luo Zheng Luo!  Luo Zheng Luo!</p>

  <p>Come out! Come out! Show yourself!"</p>

  <p>Like a thunderclap, his voice boomed in the ears of many martial artists. It echoed in the entire Oracle City and everyone heard him clearly.</p>

  <p>The civilians, on the other hand, suffered. The reverberation of his voice exploded right in front of their foreheads like bolts of lightning. All of their eyes rolled to the back of their heads and most of them had fainted due to the intensity of Master Wallace's voice.</p>

  <p>Even the weaker martial artists experienced great discomfort. Under the vibrations of the roar, they all felt their blood rushing up and down their body. Blood had come out of a few ears as their heart rates rapidly increased.</p>

  <p>It was without question. He was showing off.</p>

  <p>If a Soul Sea Realm martial artist decided to show off, what could he cause?</p>

  <p>How powerful could his Mu Ning be?</p>

  <p>For a period of time, he basked in his immense strength. Master Wallace was beyond proud of what he could do. He knew that all the warriors his voice reached trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>All of them didn't act recklessly in the York Divine Kingdom. It was just like a ridiculously wealthy man in the big city. Where he lived, it was a challenge to make something of himself. Everyone was someone. But when he went to the smaller city, he felt like he could do anything. People out there were so easily amused.</p>

  <p>In the world of martial artists, this kind of action became ruthlessness and shamelessness.</p>

  <p>Feeling entertained by what Master Wallace had just done, Master Abraham laughed and also flew up right beside him. He also absorbed a portion of energy. "Wallace, you're in a good mood! I'd like to give it a try too!"</p>

  <p>"Hey,  Luo Zheng Luo!  Luo Zheng Luo!  Luo Zheng Luo!</p>

  <p>Come out and show yourself! What are you so afraid of? Come out!"</p>

  <p>Right behind them were four Life and Death Realm martial artists who glanced at each other with faint smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>As followers, they did not dare to steal the limelight from Master Wallace and Master Abraham. But as members of the divine kingdom, they also had a strong sense of superiority no matter where they went. It was going to be a good show. In any case, killing martial artists in the Central Region was like cutting vegetables for them. They were not in a hurry at all. They wanted to see how the martial artists in Oracle City would react first. They weren't disappointed.</p>

  <p>The Oracle City fell completely silent.</p>

  <p>At that time, not a single martial artist in such a big city appeared. It was almost like a ghost town.</p>

  <p>"Just like a turtle hiding in its shell!"</p>

  <p>Master Wallace's face revealed a wicked grin. His physique made him look like a small boy, but the expression on his face said otherwise. He was a ferocious warrior.</p>

  <p>"Ha! He's not showing up." Master Abraham cackled. "The martial artists of the Sky Northern Region aren't only weak, but also incomparably cowardly!"</p>

  <p>Just as he finished mocking Luo Zheng, a flash of light came into view. The light came closer each minute, heading straight for Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>The one who came to their sight was none other than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A vague smile hung across his face, but his heart was joy-filled. Their arrival was something he looked forward to. Finally, they had come.</p>

  <p>Having been able to fight Luo Zheng in the past, Master Wallace knew him quite well.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was alone, Master Wallace smiled and said, "You're quite sensible. Since you know you can't run away, you've taken the initiative to come to where we are. I'll leave your corpse sprawled out in the open for everyone to see after I get what's in your head."</p>

  <p>With a faint hint of mockery, Zheng's eyes flashed. "My corpse? But Master Wallace, I'm not planning on dying today."</p>

  <p>"What a joke. You don't have the final say,"</p>

  <p>Master Abraham said with disdain. Even if Luo Zheng had the ability to kill a Life and Death Realm master with his extraordinary strength of Virtual Tribulation Realm, Master Abraham still looked down on him.</p>

  <p>"How about we just leave my life alone and let me decide how long I live?</p>

  <p>What do you think?" Luo Zheng said nonchalantly, with the same sly smile still plastered on his face.</p>

  <p>"Your life is already in our hands, you insignificant ant," Master Wallace retorted, extending his hand, slowly waving it towards Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come here to talk rubbish with you." Luo Zheng suddenly restrained the smile on his face. "I need some answers!"</p>

  <p>The six masters of the York Divine Kingdom were a bit baffled when they heard Zheng's words. They gave one another these curious glances. Did they hear him right? What could he want answers for? What questions did he have for them? Death was lurking in the corner for him, and he still wanted to ask questions?</p>

  <p>Since it was Luo Zheng, Master Wallace grew rather curious. "What do you want to ask?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out a few pieces of broken ancient jade from his space ring. The jade had already shattered and wasn't whole anymore.</p>

  <p>It was Hanson who presented the jade to Luo Zheng. Ning Yudie had absorbed its life force, but Luo Zheng kept the broken pieces so he could, later on, unravel their mystery.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng took out the jade, both Wallace and Abraham, along with the four Life and Death Realm martial artists that accompanied them were astounded. The same exact expression appeared across their faces.</p>

  <p>"What… How did you get the jade?" Master Wallace asked, his widened eyes focused on the jade in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heartbeat increased rapidly. As expected, Master Wallace knew the gem in his hand. He was certain that it came from the divine kingdoms, and that there were even more.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is the ancient jade? Where can it be obtained? Is it true that there are more that can be found in the four divine kingdoms?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked all of his questions in one breath.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you managed to obtain the jade, little boy. I don't have to answer your questions," Master Wallace sneered.</p>

  <p>"Could you please tell me?" Luo Zheng asked politely. His eyes conveyed his sincerity.</p>

  <p>"The ancient jade is no big secret within the divine kingdom. However, telling someone who is about to die is meaningless," Master Wallace coldly said.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong." Luo Zheng shook his finger and laughed. "It's actually pretty meaningful if you do."</p>

  <p>Master Abraham only frowned. Compared to Master Wallace, he was much more careful. However, seeing Zheng's expression and tone, he felt that there was something that wasn't adding up. So, he asked, "What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>"I'll spare the life of the one who tells me first among the six of you." Luo Zheng smiled proudly like a kid, but his expression reeked of hidden savagery.</p>

  <p>All six of them shared the same expression once again. They were all overwhelmed by Zheng's words. Did they all hear him correctly?</p>

  <p>Master Wallace hissed, "What? Do you mind saying that again?"</p>

  <p>A young man at the Virtual Tribulation Realm had dared to show disrespect towards the masters of Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm. For a moment, they thought the screws inside Zheng's head were all unhinged. What a crazy boy.</p>

  <p>"Okay, then. I said, whoever tells me the secret of the ancient jade, I'll spare his life," Luo Zheng repeated. "Take this as a race."</p>

  <p>"What a waste of time. Abraham, your soul-searching skill can explore that guy's mind to the greatest extent. I'll capture him, and then you can sift through his soul!"</p>

  <p>The secrets Luo Zheng had inside his mind were not a secret to Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>He was also aware that the dragon's soul wasn't easy to deal with. The last time his soul entered Zheng's mind, it was killed. However, that soul he used had been strengthened by the Spirit Container. It was strong already.</p>

  <p>That was why Master Wallace wasn't confident to enter Zheng's mind once again. If his soul was to be devoured by the dragon, then it wasn't worth the risk.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Master Abraham had practiced a secret technique that could save a soul from being gobbled. That was the reason why Master Wallace brought him along. Otherwise, regardless of the friendship between them, he never shared any secret with him.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng noticed that Master Wallace was about to make a move, a look of regret engulfed his face.</p>

  <p>"It seems that no one wants to answer my questions. Pity. I had no idea you didn't value your lives that much. Well, then…</p>

  <p>Come out, all of you!"</p>
