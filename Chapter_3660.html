  <p>
</p>

  <p>The nine huge suns inflated like giant balloons of fire about to pop.</p>

  <p>As the suns grew, the flowers and trees were scorched to ashes, while rocks and stones exploded like popcorn.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>"Quick! Get to the transmission array, or we're dead!"</p>

  <p>"You go first..."</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore Realm warriors ran about like headless chickens in a panic.</p>

  <p>Everyone tried to head for the transmission array. However, the array was so small that it could fit only around three people at a time. Moreover, it'd take a while to transmit those people.</p>

  <p>The people huddled around the transmission array, anxious to get in.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" a five-star Taiyi Guard roared.</p>

  <p>Fighting for survival, the more powerful warriors sneered as they shoved the weaker ones out of the way.</p>

  <p>The five-star Taiyi Guard suddenly summoned his Other Shore Token, a huge white skull. It was the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore, the most powerful creature of that stage.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power contained in its skull was astonishingly formidable.</p>

  <p>He trudged through the crowd, ominously clutching the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a throng of people were flung into the air, clearing a path for that five-star Taiyi Guard.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to enter the transmission array, a beam of sword radiance as thin as thread wove its way through the crowd until it landed on the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The five-star Taiyi Guard abruptly stopped in his tracks, and his jaw dropped in shock. Then, his eyes rolled to the back of his head, and a wound as thin as a needle made its way from his forehead to his torso.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop..."</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had been split in half by the thin sword radiance.</p>

  <p>"If you wish to enter the transmission array, line up obediently. Anyone who dares disobey will end up like that man."</p>

  <p>A crisp voice cut through the air. The people turned towards the voice, only to find out it was none other than Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>Goran had ordered her to maintain order. As she surveyed the chaos that erupted, she said nothing more. She hadn't expected someone would use his Other Shore Token to hurt his companions! Her eyes narrowed as rage seethed within her.</p>

  <p>If the people submitted to their panic, it was only a matter of time before everyone started using their Other Shore Tokens against each other.</p>

  <p>In fact, Li Bianxue had already sensed the aura of many Other Shore Tokens being activated. If these people used their Other Shore Tokens, the transmission array was at risk of being destroyed. By then no one would be able to escape!</p>

  <p>Thus, Li Bianxue made the swift decision to kill that Taiyi Guard.</p>

  <p>Frowning deeply, Li Bianxue glared at the people.</p>

  <p>They were all horrified with the scene before them.</p>

  <p>Quietly, they put away their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The once panicked, chaotic team gradually returned to their senses.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue was about to sigh with relief when suddenly something exploded in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Crack!..."</p>

  <p>A crack appeared on the icy blue umbrella.</p>

  <p>The heat radiating from the rapidly growing nine suns seeped in from the crack. It seemed that the powerful warrior from the Bright Mountain could not hold out any longer, no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>The crack started to snake its way across the surface of the umbrella, until a gap formed. From the gap, rays of light streamed in and landed on several Taiyi Guards.</p>

  <p>"Ah!!!"</p>

  <p>Screams pierced the air as those unfortunate people exploded into a cloud of ashes under the heat of the sun rays.</p>

  <p>As the others were horrified at this scene, panic welled within their hearts.</p>

  <p>They had thought they could hold on a bit longer. However, when they saw these Taiyi Guards die gruesomely, their hearts sank. It was only a matter of time before the umbrella collapsed completely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and looked to the sky. It seemed nothing could block out these suns.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>Just as he was gazing at the sky, he noticed another crack forming. A small ray of light shone from the small crack. Like a divine sword descending from the sky, it swiftly made its way to the North Mysterious City. Then another round of screams pierced the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Dodge quickly!"</p>

  <p>"It's coming! It's coming!"</p>

  <p>"The crack is spreading towards us..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned towards the sound of someone screaming, only to find out it was actually Kenelm!</p>

  <p>Kenelm was nowhere near as strong as the other disciples of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Even with the resources of the Dragon City, he was still unable to reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Although the Taiyi Heaven Palace was in urgent need of extra hands, the True Gods not reaching the Other Shore Realm wouldn't be summoned.</p>

  <p>Kenelm didn't even have the qualifications to enter the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>However, Kenelm was very faithful to his friends. He knew that the disciples of the Sword Light Palace might be in great danger or even die this time, so he followed Monica to the North Unicorn Province without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Somehow, he had been surprisingly lucky. Even though he'd faced the Jin Wu several times already, he never suffered any serious injuries.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed as though his luck was running out. As the crack made its way across the umbrella, more rays of light streamed in, steadily closing in on Kenelm.</p>

  <p>Kenelm shouted as he retreated, but no one was there to save him...</p>

  <p>Kenelm ran as fast as he could, until his knees were about to buckle from under him. He almost fainted as the scorching wave charged toward him.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to give up, a huge shadow suddenly covered him. He looked back to see what it was, and to his relief, it was a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow!</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was made by Emperor Di Jun himself, and it was immune to water and fire. Even Phoenix could not destroy it!</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng barked. Under Luo Zheng's control, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow spread its wings and flew upwards, blocking the light that streamed in from the crack.</p>

  <p>Kenelm's eyes stung as he looked at Luo Zheng gratefully, unable to fight back the tears.</p>

  <p>He had met Luo Zheng back when he was in the Excellence City. At the time, he and Luo Zheng were both consummate True Gods, but now Luo Zheng was someone he looked up to. According to what Monica and Gant had said, Luo Zheng had even single-handedly reversed the situation of the war.</p>

  <p>What did this mean?</p>

  <p>Only the powerful masters like Eastern Emperor Taiyi could do something like that...</p>

  <p>Kenelm let out a sigh of relief. It was probably his greatest luck to have met Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the worst wasn't over yet. More and more cracks formed on the umbrella. Luo Zheng continued to command other Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to rise.</p>

  <p>Each of them spread out their wings that spanned thousands of feet to block the rays of light.</p>

  <p>In a short while, over one hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu had flown up to cover the cracks.</p>

  <p>The powerful warrior of the Bright Mountain was still struggling to hold on.</p>

  <p>As he used up all his strength, his face grew paler and paler.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As the nine suns grew to an overbearing size, the warrior cried desperately,</p>

  <p>"I can't hold on any longer!"</p>

  <p>More cracks pierced the icy blue umbrella... In just a few moments, it was going to shatter into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>Felicity of the Origin Mountain flew towards him. As she stretched out her hands, an enchanted barrier flowed onto the umbrella, covering the entire North Mysterious City.</p>
