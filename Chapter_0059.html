<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Outside Bloody Mountain, the masters exchanged wide-eyed looks of disbelief and gasped in surprise.</p>

  <p>Being a master at Cloud Sect meant being well-informed, composed and mature.</p>

  <p>And through the years, they had seen all kinds of talents.</p>

  <p>Quite frankly, some of the most talented warriors were trained by them.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, they should not be so surprised.</p>

  <p>But, these masters could not help shouting excitedly. Why was that?</p>

  <p>Each of the masters had a distinct perception of the rare skills and strength Ryan possessed, and also, they knew the might of Ryan's dagger!</p>

  <p>The average people might not know, but the masters did. Those energy threads were extremely sharp, and could easily slice a low-grade spiritual weapon in two. Even a middle-grade spiritual weapon would probably be cut into pieces. To withstand those silk threads, a top-grade spiritual weapon was needed.</p>

  <p>But, what occurred just now, was so strange. Everyone, including Ryan, was shocked.</p>

  <p>It was a huge surprise when Luo Zheng withstood the silk threads with his flesh!</p>

  <p>Everyone watching had believed this to be Zheng's final stand before he was out of the Blooded Test. In their eyes, his struggle was in vain. Luo Zheng didn't stand a chance of winning against Ryan and his spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>The only foreseeable outcome of Luo Zheng crashing into the threads was?him being shredded.</p>

  <p>Much to the onlooker's surprise and Ryan's astonishment, Luo Zheng not only shattered the silk threads but also outmaneuvered Ryan in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that the crowd was?surprised. What the hell was the body of this kid made from? How did he develop ironlike flesh? His strength was comparable to a top-grade mysterious weapon. The expressions on the masters' faces were astonishment while in the heart of each was the idea of bringing him under their folds.</p>

  <p>Unlike the other masters, Dylan Fang had a bitter taste in his mouth, and hatred filled his eyes. He stared at the Picture Slab. It never struck him that Ryan could be eliminated because he was the most talented refiner in the Fang Clan. This time, his family sent four pupils to participate in the Blooded test. But unexpectedly, three of them failed. He was afraid that it was difficult for the remaining one to pass the Blooded test. Sadly, the one being kicked earlier was the young master and part of the main branch of the family. He sighed, knowing a scolding would be waiting for him next time he returned to the Fang Clan.</p>

  <p>As it was not difficult for people from the Fang Clan to be admitted to the Cloud Sect since their family was influential in pills refining, none of them would have imagined all four would fail the Blooded test. This was shameful and bitterly humiliating to the whole clan, and no doubly so for him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo!" spat Dylan through clenching teeth bitterly. The name was burned into his mind. He would never forget the humiliation brought on his clan by that kid. There were a vast number of?talents at the Cloud Sect; many of them died for many reasons. Dylan wanted to see how Luo Zheng would end! "Hmph," he snorted.</p>

  <p>When the fight ended, the masters were excited to watch another battle and tried to watch Luo Zheng, only to discover that he disappeared without a trace from the Picture Slab. Earlier, none of them cared much about the bad connection that prevented them from tracking Luo Zheng. But, after the battle with Ryan, it was evident that he was a wonder to watch! Now, with Ryan out of the test, Zheng's picture was all blurred again. Jumping up angrily, the masters looked for an outlet to vent their frustrations, and blamed Joshua.</p>

  <p>Being scolded so harshly left Joshua frowning and feeling down. He wanted to explain himself, but when he thought of the horrifying rumors about Master Su, he decided to swallow the bitter pill. He didn't dare upset her.</p>

  <p>Feeling resentment, Joshua was unsatisfied with nowhere for him to complain, and nothing to do but keep silent. 'Damn! Such bad luck! But, who is to blame? This is all that initiate Zheng's fault!' thought Joshua, shifting the blame.</p>

  <p>Finally, he had a place to lay the blame. 'He dared give me a hard time?</p>

  <p>We'll just see about that!'</p>

  <p>At their first meeting, Joshua knew Luo Zheng would be trouble. Here was this commonly born disciple who dared to oppose him, causing Master Su to criticize him, and now the instructors were scolding. How could he settle for this? He was silent, but what no one saw was how full of hatred his eyes were as he contemplated how he could get revenge.</p>

  <p>Joshua was so worked up about Luo Zheng that when he caught sight of the magic array system plate?beside him, an idea clicked into his mind. A vague smile spread across his face. 'Hey, hey there, you disgusting maggot! So, you want to pass the Blooded?test? Never!'</p>

  <p>An expert at the Cloud Sect had designed and installed the whole magic array system on Bloody Mountain. Supporting the large system, were thousands of magic arrays varying in size from small to large, and the system controlled the beasts.</p>

  <p>Since this kid embarrassed him, there was no way Luo Zheng would pass the Blooded test, unless Joshua let it happen. Looking around, Joshua made sure no one was watching him before?discreetly turning, walking up to the system plate, and placing his hands on the innermost circle of the plate.</p>

  <p>The system plate had five circles, representing the five layers in Bloody Mountain. They went from the easiest on the outside, getting progressively harder, to the innermost layer, where stayed a solitary five-grade beast, whose strength was comparable to a master at nature level.</p>

  <p>Since the disciples were at lower levels, no one had set foot on the final layer to challenge the five-grade beast in the history of Bloody Mountain.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, many people questioned whether or not the fifth layer and five-grade beast were necessary because it was impossible for anyone to challenge it successfully. It seemed pointless for a five-grade beast to be there. Why? Because it expended so much energy to imagine one with the magic array system. This was a complete waste of power that they could apply to many other places.</p>

  <p>Every time a master proposed to get rid of it though, the suggestion was rejected.</p>

  <p>Why not just let it be? After all, there was no need to make changes.</p>

  <p>Since the five-grade beast had been created, it could just stay on the fifth layer and remain there, silently, with no issues. That was the reason given by the senior managers at the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Working quietly, Joshua erased the circle at the core of the system plate, forcing the five-grade?beast to leave the center. As the innermost circle vanished, the beast, under Joshua's control, rose, rushing in Zheng's direction. When Joshua saw that the five-grade creature was closer to Luo Zheng, he drew his arms back.</p>
