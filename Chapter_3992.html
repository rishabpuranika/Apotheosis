<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Come back quickly...</p>

  <p>Since the Heavenly Obsession Civilization heard this sentence from the wails of the Treacherous Beings, it meant that they were indeed using Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>But who were they calling for?</p>

  <p>"How is it going? Do you understand what they are talking about?" the Snake Goddess asked while Zheng was in deep concentration.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand most of the sounds. They seem to be some kind of scripture," Zheng paused, realizing everyone was looking at him.</p>

  <p>Of all the warriors present, only the Wing King, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess believed that Zheng could understand Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess knew what happened in the Blooming Jade Stage; and since the Wing King and a Civilization Artifact in Zheng's body were bound together, he was also aware of it.</p>

  <p>Others remained skeptical, including Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He and Yasamin had just been rescued and did not have enough time to know about the current situation.</p>

  <p>"Are they reciting only scriptures?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>"In addition to the scriptures, they also seem to be calling for a companion to return," Zheng said admittedly.</p>

  <p>"Really? Are you sure you didn't mishear?" Pearson chuckled beside him.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters didn't believe Zheng's words at all. Looking at his seemingly serious expression, they assumed that Zheng was talking nonsense.</p>

  <p>Zheng dismissed Pearson's sarcastic words. He shook his head and said, "No, I'm sure about what I heard."</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization didn't decipher without any basis.</p>

  <p>There were only two results of the deciphering: either it was unable to decipher, or it deciphered every word accurately.</p>

  <p>Since the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had deciphered it, the information should be correct.</p>

  <p>"You are so confident," Thurston said as his eyes glimmered.</p>

  <p>"That's it. They indeed lost one companion, so they keep calling for their companion to return," the Snake Goddess suddenly concluded.</p>

  <p>Pearson questioned, "You don't know much about the Treacherous Beings, and you just passed the Whining Road by luck. How could you be so certain?"</p>

  <p>Pearson could tell that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were inexperienced in dealing with the Treacherous Beings. They had just hidden in the thatched hut in the past and snuck away after three days when the Treacherous Beings disappeared.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Pearson had personally witnessed the Treacherous Beings in the Supreme Pure Realm. He believed that he understood the Treacherous Beings better than everyone.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled slightly, reading between the lines of his words.</p>

  <p>"There are two hundred thatched huts here. In the past, every thatched hut had a Treacherous Being inside, totaling two hundred Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Now, there are only one hundred and ninety-nine of them. That means one is missing, and a thatched hut is vacant," she said as she pointed to the ground, referring to where they were all staying. It was the vacant thatched hut.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Whining Road had been difficult to pass was that Treacherous Beings were something no one could resist.</p>

  <p>Many Eternal Realm warriors and nonhuman creatures chose to walk this path; but no matter the number, they all had been annihilated.</p>

  <p>This made the Whining Road notorious for its cruelty...</p>

  <p>Now, there was a Treacherous Being missing from the Whining Road–a thatched hut had become empty. They had used this loophole to pass through the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>Hearing the Snake Goddess' explanation, Pearson immediately comprehended. He looked at Zheng with enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Zheng actually could understand Sanskrit words...</p>

  <p>"Just as Zheng said, they are calling for their companion to return. If that Treacherous Being returns, wouldn't we be in trouble?" King Ieuan suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"It had not been back for so many years. What are the odds that it would come back today?" Fuxi answered, rolling his eyes at it.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi previously had this concern. The two of them were nervous when they couldn't find the empty thatched hut, but now there was no need to worry.</p>

  <p>For twenty hours, everyone still had their hearing completely shut. They couldn't hear anything while Zheng, on the other hand, continued to listen attentively to the chants.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been working as well, trying its best to decipher even a little information for Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, these Treacherous Beings behaved stubbornly...</p>

  <p>For nearly twenty hours, they had been reciting the scriptures with only a little communication between them.</p>

  <p>Dawn came at the end of the last hour. A faint light peeped from outside the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>The strange Treacherous Beings all returned inside of their own thatched hut. They started to communicate while Zheng successfully decoded the communication part by part.</p>

  <p>A Treacherous Being started walking towards Zheng and his group's thatched hut. The Treacherous Being's footsteps approached, with everyone becoming more anxious as they felt it getting closer and closer.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" King Ieuan panicked.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess made a gesture, warning it not to use spiritual sense to communicate with others in case they would be discovered by the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>She walked carefully to the edge of the thatched hut. When the Treacherous Being was about to lift the edge, the Snake Goddess grabbed it, forcing it to shut. The Treacherous Being failed to open it, eventually giving up after several tries.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being turned around to look for another thatched hut instead. It walked further from them, putting everyone's heart at ease. They sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Soon, the sky revealed its full brightness. The Snake Goddess told everyone to recover their hearing and opened the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>Everyone walked out the thatched hut one by one. Twenty hours inside such a small space had left them in discomfort. They lifted their arms and bent their bodies to stretch.</p>

  <p>"Staying on this road for three days and directly entering the Supreme Pure Realm is the easiest thing we've done in history," Pearson said with confidence.</p>

  <p>"I remember the first time we entered the Supreme Pure Realm, half of us died..." Thurston sentimentally recalled. The Eternal Realm Hunters were all elites, but even they had to pay a huge price in going to the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>While everyone was breathing and enjoying the fresh air, the Snake Goddess found that Zheng's face was a little gloomy. "Zheng, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Everyone turned their glances, once again focusing on him.</p>

  <p>After hesitating for a moment, Zheng asked, "Is it really impossible to kill the Treacherous Beings?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's impossible to kill them," Pearson quickly answered. "Even if they get killed, they will still come back to life. They can't disappear from the world."</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were the real indestructible existences in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>"What exactly did you hear again?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings exchanged a few words before they went into the thatched huts. Their companion is trapped outside the Whining Road, which seems to be the Supreme Pure Realm," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"It might have been trapped there for many years." Fuxi nodded.</p>

  <p>"But the trapped Treacherous Being has been killed recently. They are trying to find a way to revive it, and they would do it tonight..." Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent upon hearing his statement.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stared at Zheng nervously. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," Zheng agreed.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan interrupted, "If that Treacherous Being comes back to life, doesn't that mean there won't be any vacant thatched hut?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi shared a dull aura, their faces darkening in fear.</p>

  <p>One more Treacherous Being meant that they would lose their hiding place.</p>

  <p>If the Treacherous Beings discovered them, they would definitely be attacked. Everyone could die!</p>

  <p>"Do we still have a chance to retreat?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as his face turned into a frown.</p>

  <p>"If we quit the Whining Road before the duration of three days ends, we will not be able to enter the Supreme Pure Realm nor could we return to the Grand Pure Realm. We will only be lost in the plain where we can never turn back," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Yasamin asked, her face flooded with worry.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess glanced at the thatched huts. "The only way now is to kill another Treacherous Being," she firmly declared.</p>
