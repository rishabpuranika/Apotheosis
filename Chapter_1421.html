<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1421 The Shocking Sword Strike </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the eyes of the warrior dressed in the blood-red robe, Luo Luo Zheng had just overestimated his own strength, and it would be reckless for Luo Luo Zheng to attack him.</p>

  <p>However, in Luo Zheng's opinion, it was a chance for him to test his strength.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's strength was much higher than any Soul Sea Realm warrior's. When Luo Luo Zheng had been in the Lower World, the strength displayed by the seven Spirit Supreme Realm warriors of the Celestial Position had surprised him, making him marvel at their power.</p>

  <p>However, although the warrior in the blood robe was also at the Spirit Supreme Realm, he was only the lord of a city in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. His strength might not be on par with the seven warriors of the Celestial Position. Either way, Luo Luo Zheng was curious to find out.</p>

  <p>When he saw his Nether God Shadows being instantly shattered, Luo Luo Zheng rapidly retreated, ignoring the no-fly ban on the sky!</p>

  <p>'The strength of a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior is indeed more powerful than I have imagined. This man is merely the lord of a city, and his talent might not be so outstanding. However, the power of that blood spear is beyond my expectations, ' Luo Luo Zheng marveled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was constantly pondering this information in his mind. Facing the thrust of the blood-red long spear, Luo Luo Zheng gently waved his long sword, causing wind blades and lightning to once again shoot towards the warrior in the blood robe. This attack proved ineffective though. The blood-red spear was very strange. In an instant, it turned into many blood flowers, which mixed with the Law Power, instantly melting the wind blades and lightning.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Brat. Among warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, you are indeed very remarkable, possessing a formidable strength; however, your comprehension of the Law Power is still not developed enough..." After he finished speaking, the warrior dressed in the blood robe raised his blood-red spear once more. In an instant, the no-fly ban on the entire Bright Sky City seemed to cooperate with him!</p>

  <p>The black net, which had been filled with streams of blood Mu Ning at the beginning, started to turn into a dark red net. Under this large net, tiny blood threads extended out and continuously interweaved, forming a huge blood net cage that locked around Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior dressed in the blood robe.</p>

  <p>Freya quietly sat on the Heavenly Phoenix Horse with a nervous expression on her face. Fighting against the warrior in the blood robe earlier, Luo Luo Zheng had been forced to keep on retreating. Now he had become trapped in the large cage, there was nowhere for him to retreat anymore!</p>

  <p>He was trapped!</p>

  <p>"It's over... You and Freya ascended to the Upper World at the same time, but I do not know how you managed to obtain a first-rank divine weapon and that Heavenly Phoenix Horse in the short span of a single year.</p>

  <p>However, that is no longer important, because everything that you possess will now be mine!"</p>

  <p>In the cage, the greedy look upon the face of the warrior in the blood robe gradually became more and more intense. He no longer hid anything from Luo Luo Zheng and leered at him with a terrible rage.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely glanced at the warrior nonchalantly and didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>He held his long sword up in front of him, and his eyes slightly narrowed as his entire demeanor underwent a drastic change.</p>

  <p>That tiny bit of change happened in an instant?</p>

  <p>The entire process took less than three seconds! Before the warrior in the blood robe could realize what was happening, Luo Zheng's sword had already begun to lunge out.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the warrior in the blood robe also swung his long spear, countless spear flowers appeared and moved towards Luo Luo Zheng. In his opinion, the Law Power that Luo Luo Zheng had unleashed was not worth mentioning at all.</p>

  <p>As long as he continued to dissolve the Law Power, he would be able to easily resist Luo Zheng's attack, and then kill Luo Luo Zheng with a single spear strike! His arrogance would prove his downfall though, as he had underestimated Luo Luo Zheng through his poor judgment.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that this seemingly casual sword strike from Luo Luo Zheng would be so different from before!</p>

  <p>He could feel in it a power that he could not comprehend!</p>

  <p>It was a very ordinary strike! Yet...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not even use the Law Power, but instead there was only a long and sharp sword intent that lingered and expanded at a phenomenal rate.</p>

  <p>Clearly, this seemingly ordinary strike contained a sword force that caused the warrior to be at a loss. Hesitating, the warrior in the blood robe paused uncertainly.</p>

  <p>He felt as if Luo Luo Zheng wasn't a living creature at all in that moment, but had become a stone without any life energy in it.</p>

  <p>But how could a stone wield the sword?</p>

  <p>And how could he launch such a terrifying sword strike? It was beyond the warrior's field of knowledge.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was that Luo Luo Zheng didn't have any accumulated energy. This sudden sword strike seemed like a casual thrust, but it caused the warrior in the blood robe to feel an unstoppable force.</p>

  <p>Without thinking, the warrior took a step back from the intensity of Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike...</p>

  <p>It was said that it was a sword strike that could injure and even kill a True God. Although Luo Luo Zheng could not yet employ it perfectly, the sword force contained within was terrifying enough.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike contained an unstoppable power, and more importantly, compared to other trump cards, the sword strike did not require any accumulation of force at all. As long as a warrior fully comprehended it, he could easily perform it at any time. After the sword intent was activated, the warrior could destroy anything with a single sword strike. The power of this strike was devastating, and the warrior in the blood robe gasped in sudden fear.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been anxious previously. In his opinion, although Luo Luo Zheng had displayed quite a powerful strength, he could still easily defeat him with the help of the no-fly ban and his Dark Blood Cultivation. He had considered Luo Luo Zheng as a minor inconvenience to be dealt with.</p>

  <p>But the reversal had happened in an instant! Suddenly the warrior knew raw fear, as he realized that he could not oppose this terrifying force which Luo Luo Zheng wielded.</p>

  <p>Just as he had been prepared to torture Luo Luo Zheng bit by bit to let him understand the price he was going to pay, Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly launched such a terrible sword attack.</p>

  <p>When the warrior finally ceased being perplexed, he discovered that he had been completely penetrated by Luo Zheng's sword force! His body was impaled upon the force, as if he had met an immovable object.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, his entire body crumbled into pieces that began to rapidly disintegrate.</p>

  <p>The first thing to dissipate was his torso, and the last thing to disappear was his head?</p>

  <p>Before the warrior's head could completely shatter, Luo Zheng's gaze remained indifferent as he asked, "Tell me, what price did you want me to pay?"</p>

  <p>The warrior's head glared at Luo Luo Zheng indignantly, and then began to disintegrate into bits and pieces, slowly dissipating in the air...</p>

  <p>'How can there be such an extraordinary warrior? He even destroyed my main body with a single strike! Oh my God!' the warrior thought in despair.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the mansion of the lord of the Bright Sky City, a secret room was filled with the smell of fresh blood. A mass of blood essence floated in the air, forming a human figure that roared relentlessly in the air! The Dark Blood Cultivation that the warrior in the blood robe had used was able to create a blood vigor body.</p>

  <p>In the future, he might be able to use this blood vigor body to form a second physical body which would be exactly the same as his.</p>

  <p>However, his blood vigor body had not been completely cultivated yet.</p>

  <p>But now his main body had already been destroyed. This was a huge blow to him!</p>

  <p>With a crazed roar, the blood body formed from the blood essence seemed to have suddenly discovered something. Surprise appeared on his bloodied face. "Master Shen! It seems like Master Shen is flying towards Bright Sky City. After I inform him about this news, I will have one last chance!' the crimson being thought.</p>

  <p>The accidental destruction of his main body was a huge loss to Bright Sky City, but if Master Shen was willing to protect him, this loss could be easily made up for!</p>

  <p>A hall master of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place controlled a thousand cities. In the eyes of the lord of Bright Sky City, those masters were very mighty and powerful, and were extremely important figures within the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. After the blood man completely absorbed the blood in the pool, he rushed out of the chamber, still dripping crimson splashes on the cobbled floor.</p>

  <p>The power that had erupted from Luo Zheng's sword strike was too strong. It had easily pierced through the physical body of the warrior in the blood robe, and had also easily destroyed the no-fly ban. The sword intent had stretched out across an extreme distance, spanning tens of thousands of miles. Only then had the sword force that Luo Luo Zheng had gathered finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>Even after dissipating, the power of that sword momentum was still felt by a great many warriors.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors within a radius of over one hundred thousand miles all felt the formidable sword power at the same time. The lords of more than one hundred cities came forth out of their residences and raised their heads to look at the echoes of the sword strike that was coming from the west. Their faces were all serious and ireful.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place did not experience any large conflicts. After all, ordinary warriors did not dare to fight within the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. However, who were the warriors that had been fighting just now? And only a powerful Spirit Supreme Realm warrior, who used all of his strength, would have been able to unleash such power....</p>

  <p>Many of the city lords felt the remnant power of the sword attack and rushed towards Bright Sky City. The first to arrive at the city was a hall master of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>This master's surname was Shen, and he could have been considered an acquaintance of Luo Luo Zheng. When Luo Luo Zheng had left the mine in the past, it was Master Shen and Master He who had led him to the Holy City. There was a history between him and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had just hastened over when he saw a bloody figure emitting a bloody light rushing towards him.</p>
