</p>

  <p>"Help me kill Eddie?" Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up.</p>

  <p>Xun's suggestion was worth giving a shot to.</p>

  <p>Eddie's cultivation base was at the Life and Death Realm, and he had only been through three life and death crises.</p>

  <p>His strength might probably only be equivalent to that of a third-level war sage.</p>

  <p>There were at least a million third-level war sages in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place alone. Even though Eddie was much stronger than a normal war sage, there were still Soul Sea Realm masters like Amber in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>With their combined strength, they could easily kill Eddie.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng were to bring this group of members from the Demon Night's sacred place back to the Central Region, he would be able to defeat every sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The difference between a sacred place and a fifth-grade sect was very great.</p>

  <p>But the gap between an ordinary sect and the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was even greater because the latter was a seventh-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still shook his head, his eyes determined. "Eddie has already become an obstacle of my warrior spirit. As for this obstacle, I'll have to deal with him myself!"</p>

  <p>Although the warrior spirit could not increase a warrior's combat strength, it was still undeniably important for a warrior. If Luo Zheng's warrior spirit didn't move on smoothly, it would gradually overcome him with depression and despair. It would, in the end, become his inner spirit demon and the biggest obstacle of his whole life.</p>

  <p>This kind of hindrance would prevent Luo Zheng's cultivation from progressing at best and cause him to go wrong in his martial arts cultivation and spiral into madness at critical moments at worst.</p>

  <p>Back when Eddie had turned into a giant face above the Cloud Sect, Luo Luo Zheng had sworn to himself that he would take Eddie's life with his own hands.</p>

  <p>"I won't ask others to help me kill Eddie. I will kill him personally," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Xun was experienced enough to understand the meaning of Luo Zheng's words. Since Luo Luo Zheng had already promised her his help, her goal had already been achieved to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>She was the queen of killings, but her true body had been destroyed by someone else in a moment of carelessness where she had lost everything.</p>

  <p>Now that the strand of her soul did not dissipate, the light around her statue did not extinguish even though it was dim. The rules of the Demon Night dictated that they would only select a different queen to take charge of killings only if the light in their queen's statue disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>As long as this strand of her soul was not destroyed, she still had a sliver of hope to turn things around. And all her hopes were pinned on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>So from now on, Xun would fully cooperate with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Xun walked to the entrance of the palace and let the Demon Night members who were waiting outside enter.</p>

  <p>Amber and the other members of the Demon Night were shocked as they saw the broken statue and the gigantic black sword sticking out of its side.</p>

  <p>The queen's statue was holy for the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because the statue was made of precious materials, but because these statues were their faith. In other circumstances, anybody who as much as accidentally touched the queens' statues would receive the harshest of punishments. But here it was now, broken into pieces. How could something of this importance not cause them to be startled?</p>

  <p>But...</p>

  <p>The huge black sword was Xun's weapon.</p>

  <p>Many members of the Demon Night had seen Xun's sword in the Tower of Sin before. It looked like their queen had broken this statue herself.</p>

  <p>But why?</p>

  <p>Could it be some kind of a dispute between the two queens?</p>

  <p>Amber and the other Soul Sea Realm masters thought all of this, but they didn't dare ask Xun about what had happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed inwardly as he saw the shock registered on their faces. 'You must be very surprised looking at the two queens of the Demon Night scolding each other like two bad-tempered women, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Clean up the area and don't erect this statue here again," Xun said coldly. She had regained her lofty and aloof expression, now that the other members were here.</p>

  <p>"Don't put it here anymore? Why?" Amber asked, astonished.</p>

  <p>The statues of the three queens had to stand there together. Not a single one could be moved, which was a rule of all sacred lands of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>And Xun's order had confused everyone.</p>

  <p>Anyone else would be instantly killed if they were to say something like this.</p>

  <p>But now that their queen had spoken thus, everyone had no choice but to obey her order. They could not blame or punish her for it.</p>

  <p>Xun thought for a moment and then sighed. "Forget it. Just make another one and remember to make it a little uglier!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng almost laughed out loud at Xun's words. This woman was too scary. Once she developed a grudge against someone, she would not stop working against her enemy until her enemy had been killed.</p>

  <p>Amber and the rest, on the other hand, had fear and trepidation writ large on their faces, seemingly at a loss of what to do.</p>

  <p>Xun walked calmly in front and Luo Luo Zheng followed her. The senior leaders of the Demon Night followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>This Demon Night queen's behavior with the Demon Night members was completely different from her behavior with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The huge holy tree was hollowed out in the middle, inside which was a hundred-story palace.</p>

  <p>Amber led Luo Luo Zheng into the Demon Night sacred place's treasure house to pick out a weapon.</p>

  <p>The sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor was huge and powerful, but it wasn't at too high a level. What was more, when Xun had fought with Cheryl in the Tower of Sin, Cheryl had grabbed her sword, leaving several deep grooves on it. It could be used appropriately but it also could break at any point in time. So Xun needed to choose a new weapon now.</p>

  <p>The number of resources and treasures that a seventh-grade sacred place had far exceeded those that the Cloud Hall and the Ethereal Spirit Sect had.</p>
