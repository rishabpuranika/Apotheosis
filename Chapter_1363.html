<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Margaret's words, another elder laughed and said, "I admit that you are right to a certain extent. However, it's quite normal for a man to have several wives. And since he has ascended to the Upper World, it's possible that he might have found a new partner there. How are you going to compete with his new wife, if you are not strong enough?"</p>

  <p>Actually, this was pure speculation on the elder's part. She didn't know Zheng, and so she didn't know his true character. She had only heard from the tower head that her husband thought highly of Zheng's strength and talent. She hadn't witnessed it first-hand.</p>

  <p>But she wanted Margaret to focus on her cultivation, so she had no other choice but to spout this sort of a nonsensical theory. She wanted to motivate Margaret to concentrate on her cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't care!" Margaret declared.</p>

  <p>This method had been used too many times. It was pretty effective originally, but gradually it was becoming more and more ineffective due to the boredom of cultivation.</p>

  <p>Margaret sat grumpily in the corner, unwilling to pick up her sword and continue with her training.</p>

  <p>Margaret was throwing a tantrum and the elders were out of ideas to persuade her. Everyone was at their wits' end. This girl was such a stubborn student!</p>

  <p>It was all the more frustrating for the elders as Margaret had a great talent for cultivation that was not inferior to her brother's. However, she was obstinate and had always been pampered by the elders in her clan, so no one was able to arm-twist her into cultivating.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng would be the person who could tame this shrew.</p>

  <p>Those elders in front of her were all famous figures in the Purple Power World, yet none of them had a way to persuade her into cultivating.</p>

  <p>Just then a figure quietly walked in and stood not far away from them.</p>

  <p>When Margaret saw that person, she said in an aggrieved tone, "Master!"</p>

  <p>The others noticed her too and turned to greet her respectfully, "Elder Apeiron!"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron strolled towards them. Seeing the grievance on Margaret's face, she smiled softly and said, "I heard that the Illusion Battlefield will open in a few years."</p>

  <p>Margaret looked at her with curiosity and asked, "Master, what is the Illusion Battlefield?"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron smiled and asked, "You have cultivated in an Illusion Space before, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Creating Illusion Space was a very common practice in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Many great sacred places had this sort of space, which served as a platform for warriors to spar with each other.</p>

  <p>Margaret nodded in reply. She had practiced in that space as well.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron continued, "When the Illusion Battlefield is thrown open, all the younger-generation warriors from different races all around the universe will compete and fight with each other. I believe Zheng will also participate in this event!"</p>

  <p>Margaret pondered over this for a moment and said, "So..."</p>

  <p>"If you can reach the Soul Sea Realm in the coming years, I will help you to enter the Illusion Battlefield! If you can fight for your place in the Illusion Battlefield using your own strength, you might have the chance to meet Zheng there!" Elder Apeiron said with an enigmatic smile.</p>

  <p>"Really?!" Margaret was startled with this piece of information.</p>

  <p>"However, the enemies you will meet in the Illusion Battlefield will be from all races from across the universe. There will be experts from all sorts of races, and their talents and strength can not be underestimated. It won't be easy for you to meet Zheng." Elder Apeiron added with a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" remarked Margaret, the surprise on her face slowly changing to hesitation.</p>

  <p>She had learnt a lot after entering the Apeiron Tower. She understood the many advantages of her Purple Power Body as well as her great potential in martial arts.</p>

  <p>She was very confident in her own talent, but not in her perseverance to follow through something.</p>

  <p>The main reason of her impatience was that she didn't know how long it would actually be before she could see Zheng again if she continued cultivating like this. Would it take ten years? Or a hundred years? Or even a thousand years?</p>

  <p>The thought alone was enough to make her tingle with fear!</p>

  <p>However, if she could reach the Soul Sea Realm and then enter the Illusion Battlefield like Elder Apeiron had said, she might just get the opportunity to meet Zheng!</p>

  <p>"I can guarantee you that if you work hard in your cultivation, your chances of meeting Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield will be very high!"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron assured her.</p>

  <p>Margaret pursed her lips, a trace of determination slowly appearing in her eyes. She would work very hard for Zheng. She would put in her heart and soul if it meant getting a chance to meet him.</p>

  <p>"I understand now, Master..."</p>

  <p>The great ship on which Zheng was entered the trans-border channel and began to travel across different supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not so lucky as Margaret in comparison. Ever since she had entered the Apeiron Tower, Elder Apeiron had tried to satisfy whatever she wanted. Moreover, she enjoyed an exalted status in the tower and was even addressed as the Young Master. She never lacked words of encouragement when she was tired of cultivating.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had to fight for everything he required.</p>

  <p>It was said that Passing the Torch would reward a warrior richly.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Zheng wouldn't miss such a good opportunity.</p>

  <p>A few days later, the ship finally left the trans-border channel to reveal a strange world in front of them.</p>

  <p>Yolande led the Mist Palace's warriors out of the ship and continued flying onward.</p>

  <p>Below them was a stretch of orange-colored water. This boundless orange sea was indeed quite a bizarre sight for visitors.</p>

  <p>"This world..." Zheng mumbled with a puzzled expression on his face. He detected a strange aura here.</p>

  <p>Layla, who was flying next to him, was calm and composed as she spoke, "This is a shattered supreme world."</p>

  <p>"A shattered supreme world? Is it the same as the Purple Power World?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded and replied, "That's why the alliance chose this place for the Passing the Torch. This broken world was once called the Orange Sea World because all the seawater in this world is orange!"</p>

  <p>The Orange Sea World was home to a particular type of tiny organism, which was great in number and densely scattered across the ocean. It was their color that dyed the entire ocean orange.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of years ago, the Orange Sea World had been a complete supreme world. However, several Supreme Lords of the human race had a skirmish with each other, which had led to a battle in the Orange Sea World. The supreme world hadn't been able to withstand the massive power of these Supreme Lords and had been shattered into pieces in the end. Only ten percent of the original Orange Sea World survived, so the present world could no longer be considered a supreme world.</p>

  <p>Their destination was a gigantic island called Willow Island in the Orange Sea World. It would host the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>This 'island' was so named only by the warriors in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>According to the standards in the Lower World, this so-called island was ten times larger than the Central Region and could easily pass off as a continent!</p>

  <p>After hearing Layla's introduction, Zheng nodded and smiled with gratitude. She might have caused many troubles in the Mist Palace, but she still was a good source of information.</p>

  <p>After all, he had come from the Lower World, and Yolande was the only one he knew in the Mist Palace. He didn't want to bother her with every small question he had. So he didn't even know what Passing the Torch was actually about.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the warriors from the Mist Palace finally arrived at the island.</p>

  <p>After walking on the island for an hour, a huge rock appeared in front of their eyes.</p>

  <p>The rock was about ten thousand feet high and a hundred thousand feet wide. A poem was carved on to its surface.</p>

  <p>The poem was etched deep into the mammoth rock, and the words seemed to contain some kind of magical power within them. Many warriors looked uncomfortable as they stared at the words, as if the strokes of the words contained sharp swords, which could cut their hearts out any minute.</p>

  <p>However, most warriors tried to suppress their discomfort when they looked around and found out that other people remained calm. As warriors, they refused to admit being inferior to others. Since other people could bear the pressure, they would try to stand it as well in order not to lose their faces.</p>

  <p>Layla suddenly turned to Zheng and asked with a smile, "How do you feel?"</p>

  <p>He stared at the words on the rock and replied softly, "I feel a little uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Her lips curled as she said, "You're an honest man. Look at those fellows in front of us. They are all in great pain but still pretend as if nothing has happened. They are dead determined to save their faces!"</p>

  <p>She didn't bother to lower her voice so some warriors heard her. They were furious but also embarrassed because she had revealed their true feelings. The writing on the rock was indeed torturous for many warriors.</p>

  <p>"This poem was carved by a Supreme Lord with his sword. The sword intent contained within the words can aim directly at one's heart. His sword intent was praised to be perfect, having absolutely no flaws!"</p>

  <p>Layla explained. She could feel the anger of the warriors, but she didn't seem to mind it in the slightest as she continued to enlighten Zheng.</p>
