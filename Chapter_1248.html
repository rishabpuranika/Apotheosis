<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been quite a while since Dillon had constantly watched the Heavenly Stellar Palace. When he heard that Zheng had finally returned, he immediately rushed over to meet him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was confused when he saw Dillon's anxious expression.</p>

  <p>What was he about to hear this time?</p>

  <p>A few puffs of air escaped Dillon's lips before he relaxed, and told Zheng everything. After that, Zheng suddenly realized that Margaret and Yudie had fought again. What was their fight about now?</p>

  <p>It was known that Margaret's and Yudie's cultivation bases were far from each other. Yudie was a Life and Death Realm master, while Margaret was only at the Internal Elixir Realm. The Virtual Tribulation Realm lay between those two cultivation bases, so they clearly weren't at the same level.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret's strength wasn't easily measured. She wasn't just an ordinary warrior, since she relied not on her own strength but on the Purple Power World's assistance from beginning to the end...</p>

  <p>As of now in the entire Central Region, Zheng had both killed Eddie and Simon. Other than a few independent warriors who had yet to appear, Yudie and Margaret were probably the strongest and most powerful. If those two fought, a highly intense battle might ensue.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long after Zheng had destroyed the Heavenly Evil Sect that he had brutally killed Simon. The few members of the Heavenly Evil Sect who wanted to revive their sect were finally defeated, and the entire Central Region gradually became stable.</p>

  <p>The rebuilding of the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the Ethereal City also progressed slowly but orderly. The other sects also developed steadily, and the same could be said for the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance. On the other hand, the warriors had fewer and fewer things to talk about...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, the battle between Margaret and Yudie became a hot topic in the Central Region, and it spread quickly like wildfire.</p>

  <p>Before, the warriors who loved to guess and gossip believed that Yudie and Zheng were romantically involved. While most warriors knew about the relationship between Margaret, the young lady of the Xi Clan, and Zheng, they didn't know that it was she who had summoned the numerous swords that had killed the people of the Heavenly Evil Sect that day.</p>

  <p>Currently, the argument between the two women had escalated into a fight. Such news had of course, spread quickly.</p>

  <p>When news of it had spread, many began to feel jealous of Zheng. Aside from Margaret being Xander's granddaughter, Yudie attracted many warriors in the Central Region. However, Yudie always looked aloof on the exterior and had a high position and cultivation base. Thus, ordinary warriors were inferior to her. Most warriors who fancied her could only admire her in secret, and had no chances of getting close to her.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had these two women infatuated with him, and even fight each other for him. Of course, many warriors who saw that were envious.</p>

  <p>Some of them even felt that they couldn't accept this fact.</p>

  <p>However, this was all due to Zheng's negligence.</p>

  <p>He had left the Luo Clan at sixteen, and had constantly practiced martial arts ever since. He had several years of experience and became a young man in his twenties, and had made great achievements in the field of martial arts that were impossible for other warriors of the Lower World to make. But, he didn't know much about love and had no idea how to deal with his relationships with women.</p>

  <p>While Margaret's personality had greatly changed and she was obedient towards Zheng, she was still a person who refused to admit defeat. Even if she was willing to take care of Yudie when the latter was asleep, it didn't mean that Margaret would give in. On the contrary, she only cared about Zheng. She could give up or sacrifice other things, but never on Zheng. She would always fight for him.</p>

  <p>As for Yudie— the powerful, noble, and respected lady since her youth, she was in control of the Cloud Hall at a young age. Zheng had once been a disciple of the Cloud Hall, and she was older than him. Although a warrior's lifespan was long and being a few years older didn't mean much, Yudie was more reserved and mature when it came to affection.</p>

  <p>But Yudie was someone who pursued perfection. Even if she was immersed in martial arts and didn't get to choose a life partner, women's fantasies about love were still perfectly magnificent. But she couldn't tolerate it if there was a single flaw in the love— it was like a black dot that marred a perfectly smooth jade.</p>

  <p>The most troublesome thing was after Zheng had hurried back and awakened Yudie, he left in a hurry. He didn't arrange properly for that matter.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had left, the air between the two women had changed drastically. Although they didn't argue, they clearly didn't get along at all.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the others had noticed it.</p>

  <p>To add to the troubles, Yudie didn't immediately return to the Cloud Hall, and waited for Zheng all the time in the World Commercial Alliance instead.</p>

  <p>At that point, Imogen, who had gone overseas, had returned.</p>

  <p>All the Life and Death Realm warriors were fully prepared for life and death crises in advance.</p>

  <p>Then again, it wasn't easy to undergo the life and death crisis. Thus, the Life and Death Realm warriors seized every moment of chance and used every method they had to pass through the tribulation.</p>

  <p>At that time, Imogen knew that she wouldn't be able to undergo the second life and death crisis due to her old age and declining strength. In that case, she only had one way left, which was to go overseas and search for opportunities.</p>

  <p>In fact, warriors in the Central Region and the war kings and war emperors of the four divine kingdoms alike would all choose to go overseas to look for opportunities.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't easy to look for those overseas opportunities. In most cases, the warriors who were almost at the end of their lives never returned. They most likely died in an unknown sea in the great world.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Yudie clearly knew what it meant when Imogen left for overseas at that time.</p>

  <p>Yet, she never expected to receive a voice message from Imogen in her own message rune upon checking it when she woke up. Imogen had already returned to the Central Region and had rushed back to Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Yudie was ecstatic. Now that her master, Imogen, hadn't died overseas, it meant that she might've passed the second life and death crisis. Putting aside the fact that her master's strength had greatly increased, Yudie would be the happiest as long as her master survived in this world.</p>

  <p>After all, Imogen had already become Yudie's only family after her entire family had been exterminated.</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance were also overjoyed when they heard the news. They even organized a banquet for Imogen's return.</p>

  <p>Not a lot of warriors were invited to the banquet, but the leaders of the fourth-grade sects in the Central Region as well as Xander and the other warriors, who were busy rebuilding the Ethereal Spirit Sect, would join the banquet.</p>

  <p>When Imogen learned that so much had happened since she left the Central Region, she sighed. Luckily, the Heavenly Evil Sect had been destroyed and peace and harmony were restored in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>There was currently nothing to worry about.</p>

  <p>However, Xander had mentioned his great-granddaughter, Margaret, to Imogen during the banquet.</p>

  <p>He politely expressed that if Margaret would marry Zheng of the Cloud Hall in the future, he and Imogen would become relatives by marriage.</p>

  <p>Imogen was in a good mood when she had known that Zheng, who was quite powerful, had killed Eddie and even found some super masters to kill the masters of the divine kingdoms. But when she heard Xander mention Margaret so suddenly, she was surprised and her expression quickly changed. She turned around to look for Yudie and saw the younger woman with an unreadable face. At that moment, Imogen, who was known for her violent temper, got furious.</p>

  <p>She knew that Yudie liked Zheng. Before, she didn't think that Zheng was good enough to deserve her most outstanding disciple, but now it seemed that the two of them were a perfect match. One was the leader of the Cloud Hall, the strongest sect in the Central Region, and the other one was the strongest warrior in the Central Region! They were definitely made for each other, but why did Margaret suddenly appear to meddle in their relationship?</p>

  <p>"She is just a nobody. How could she even deserve to marry a powerful warrior like Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Everyone present were all reputable figures. Although the Ethereal Spirit Sect was under reconstruction, Xander wasn't easy to deal with. It was only a matter of time before the Ethereal Spirit Sect would be powerful and prosperous just like before. Xander pulled a long face upon hearing Imogen. He was quite fond of Margaret, so how could he tolerate such insults towards her?</p>

  <p>Thus, the two of them began to quarrel and tension quickly filled the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Dillon, Hobbes, and the rest looked worried.</p>

  <p>They regretted holding such a banquet. No one expected that such a small matter would cause a commotion.</p>

  <p>If only Xander and Imogen argued, then this matter would be over. And everything would have to be discussed after Zheng returned. But when Brent saw his sister being insulted like that, he was unhappy and thus spoke out in Margaret's defense.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Yudie and Margaret themselves got involved, and the ruckus had gotten worse.</p>
