<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If they were in the outside world, the strength of these corpses would not have been even close to outstanding.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples of Cloud Hall who were at the Internal Elixir Realm could have killed them easily in that case. But after entering the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, their cultivation bases had been suppressed.</p>

  <p>Even though these disciples were at the Internal Elixir Realm and two of them were even at the final stage of that realm, under the suppression, their strength was only equivalent to that of a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, making it difficult for them to deal with such corpses.</p>

  <p>In the Martial Arts Contest, Luo Luo Zheng, a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, had defeated a divine-level talent at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the people of Cloud Hall no longer viewed Luo Luo Zheng as a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm. But once they had entered the celestial tomb, with everyone's cultivation level suppressed to a certain extent, Luo Zheng's strength should have been reduced to a much lower level, and he should not have been able to fight against these corpses.</p>

  <p>But just now, Luo Luo Zheng had killed these corpses effortlessly right in front of them.</p>

  <p>It didn't take an extraordinary intelligence to guess from this fact that Luo Luo Zheng was on a par with Emanuel, Saint Morphens, and the other elders.</p>

  <p>The disciples were really confused now.</p>

  <p>The fact that a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm could cross an entire realm to challenge a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm was a miracle in itself. Luo Luo Zheng had accomplished this feat, which meant that he had the talent, the terrifying strength, and the great power to do so.</p>

  <p>Although they hadn't believed it initially, they were gradually able to accept it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Eden and killed Marilyn all by himself in the Martial Arts Contest. If it hadn't been for Eddie's threat, he wouldn't have had to quit the contest to set up the sect-protecting array for the Cloud Hall. Maybe, if he had progressed forwards, even Brent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect would not have been his match.</p>

  <p>Many people were unwilling to admit it, but in the end, they still had to accept it.</p>

  <p>However, to surpass two great realms and be comparable to a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm was a bit too much.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, how did you do it?" one of the disciples asked.</p>

  <p>The two elders at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm also looked at Luo Luo Zheng, hoping that he would give them the answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng spread out his hands and smiled slightly. Before they had their answer, his figure suddenly flashed out as he took a step over fifty to sixty feet in space, and once again sent out a sword attack.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Another corpse was struck down by Luo Zheng's sword. Its body swayed a little, then it knelt down before Luo Luo Zheng and fell to the ground with yet another thud.</p>

  <p>Yudie's mysterious ice halberd was equally powerful. Each time she attacked, the cold air her weapon exuded would freeze more than ten corpses. She would then brandish the halberd and rush forward.</p>

  <p>Clang clang clang?</p>

  <p>She rushed forward once again, and the corpses, like pieces of crystal, were smashed into pieces by her charge. The next moment, the corpses lay in pieces on the ground.</p>

  <p>After exterminating the corpses before her, Ning Yudie turned her head, just in time to see Luo Luo Zheng explode the head of one of the corpses. She was a little shocked at first and then flashed a smile as she recovered herself. She knew that in Luo Zheng's dictionary, there was no "I can't." The speed at which Luo Luo Zheng had exterminated the corpses was comparable to Saint Morphens and Emanuel.</p>

  <p>Imogen herself did not take any action. These corpses were indeed troublesome, but it was just one small problem. They had just come in, and if Imogen had to deal with the very first problem they had to face, then they'd better return now.</p>

  <p>Under the continuous extermination by Ning Yudie, the elders, and Luo Luo Zheng, the number of corpses continued to decrease rapidly.</p>

  <p>After the last corpse was smashed into pieces by Yudie's halberd, a loud roar came from the end of the road, followed by heavy footsteps.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie rushed ahead and stood in front of the crowd with her halberd laid horizontally behind her back and her beautiful eyes staring at the darkness ahead.</p>

  <p>Very soon, a huge figure rushed out from the darkness.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a huge wave of evil spirit swept towards the crowd.</p>

  <p>The elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were unaffected by the evil spirit as they were able to withstand its intimidating power. However, even among them, other than Emanuel and Saint Morphens, everyone's face had turned a deathly shade of pale.</p>

  <p>As for the group of disciples at the Internal Elixir Realm, their faces had turned an even paler shade, as if the entire blood from their faces had been sucked dry, and their teeth were chattering loudly.</p>

  <p>"What a strong evil spirit!" one of the disciples remarked as he controlled the fear in his heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression, however, did not change. His eyes were as calm as usual as he stared intently at the darkness in front of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't unfamiliar with demons. Back in White Emperor City, he had killed numerous demon soldiers and demon generals himself. Furthermore, he had nearly died at the hands of a demon king.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for those demons, and even for the demon kings he had encountered, to erupt with such powerful evil spirit. If not for the fact that Luo Zheng's soul had entered the Fighting Soul Realm, he probably wouldn't have had the slightest chance of resisting such a strong evil spirit.</p>

  <p>Instead, he too would have become extremely afraid and deathly pale.</p>

  <p>"Demon?" Ning Yudie frowned.</p>

  <p>Under the attacks of so many warriors over time, all the demons in the Central Region had already been forced into a state of almost complete extinction. As a consequence, a portion of the demon population had gone to the Eastern Region and created a huge spatial rift in order to attack the Central Region with the Eastern Region as their base.</p>

  <p>That was the primary reason why Luo Luo Zheng had gone to White Emperor City to train.</p>

  <p>However, because of the existence of the Cloud Sect, and their timely intervention, the demon clan had had no opportunity to expand.</p>

  <p>The number of demons currently in existence was comparable to that of humans, so naturally, they did not only have demon soldiers, demon kings and demon generals but also demon emperors. However, if they were to send out powerful demon emperors, the Cloud Hall would naturally have to send out warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm to battle them. Similar things had already happened in the past.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly! It's a dead demon emperor who has been refined into a corpse. I will deal with it," Imogen said indifferently, using her walking stick to move forward.</p>

  <p>"It's only a demon emperor corpse, Master. There's no need for you to step in. I can handle it." Ning Yudie stopped her and rushed to the darkness.</p>

  <p>Ever since she had stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm, she had suppressed herself and had not used her full strength. However, someone had once estimated her true strength and said although she was at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, her true strength was equivalent to that of a cultivator at the final stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Yudie's white figure floated forwards, and under the fluttering of her skirt, bits of ice mist also quietly spread out.</p>

  <p>Bang bang bang...</p>

  <p>A demon emperor was ten times stronger than a demon king, and an average demon emperor had a height more than three times that of an average human being. As it stood in front of Ning Yudie, the demon emperor looked like a giant when compared to her petite figure.</p>

  <p>"Hem!"</p>

  <p>The demon emperor's throat let out a weird sound as it waved its claws towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just as the two claws were about to land on Ning Yudie, they were blocked by her halberd. She was holding the halberd with one hand and was actually resisting the power of the demon emperor corpse's pair of claws.</p>

  <p>The halberd alone was more than four feet taller than Ning Yudie herself, but in her small hand, light blue colored life vitality continued to flash and thrust out. She held the halberd that didn't match with her figure expertly with a sort of graceful flourish, and blocked the hands of the demon emperor corpse. The scene was remarkable and made everyone feel shocked.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that Yudie's petite body would contain such power?</p>

  <p>Not only that, she then suddenly flipped her hand, causing the halberd to move downwards. As a result, the demon emperor corpse's hands were forced downwards too, and he was forced a couple of steps back.</p>

  <p>Inch by inch, this mountain-like demon emperor corpse was being suppressed by Yudie's delicate figure. It was as if the halberd's weight had increased to a million or even ten million pounds for the demon emperor, but was light as a feather for Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>In the end, the demon emperor corpse finally could not bear the pressure and actually knelt down on one knee. Even in that position, it was still several feet taller than Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The demon emperor corpse had lost its consciousness and was merely a puppet designed to kill. It was no match for Ning Yudie, but it wasn't aware of that. Under this circumstance, a normal person would have given up, but the demon emperor corpse still used all of its strength to resist the halberd. The strange noises it was making became louder. Its red compound eyes stared at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Ning Yudie sneered. Her small hand which was holding the halberd suddenly shrunk towards her body, which then spun in a circle and took the halberd on a spin too, finally hitting the demon emperor corpse from the side.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The demon emperor corpse was sent flying by Yudie's weapon and heavily crashed into a wall not far away.</p>

  <p>Frank's eyes lit up at this scene. He had always thought that Ning Yudie was not qualified to become the sect leader. But now that she had exploded forth with her true strength, he was ashamed of himself and believed that his assessment had been wrong.</p>

  <p>Not only him, everyone else was also shocked by Yudie's remarkable strength.</p>

  <p>Once it had fallen down, Ning Yudie did not give the demon emperor corpse a chance to get up. Her figure flashed again and a snow-white rune appeared in her left eye.</p>

  <p>"Absolute Freezing!"</p>

  <p>The next moment, a terrifying wave of cold energy burst out from Yudie's body. The celestial tomb, which was originally filled with negative energy, now became so cold that it felt like they all were standing in a cave of ice.</p>

  <p>Just as the demon emperor corpse was about to get up, its body suddenly stiffened from the cold and turned into ice. It was frozen in space, halfway through getting up and could not move.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie brandished her halberd, and the demon emperor corpse, just like the other corpses that had been broken into icy pieces before, was smashed into confetti.</p>
