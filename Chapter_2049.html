  <p>Luo Zheng's sword only slashed at air before Supreme Lord Barrie.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword did not make direct contact, but the Causality Breaking Light entered Supreme Lord Barrie's body.</p>

  <p>The latter paid no mind to Luo Zheng's attack at all.</p>

  <p>When he activated the immortal Highly Toxic Body, even a mid-rank or a top-rank Supreme Lord would find it difficult to kill him. All they could do was continuously expel him? such was to say that the current Supreme Lord Barrie was practically invincible.</p>

  <p>But as the cyan light on Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword flashed by, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie's Highly Toxic Body instantly faded from the surface of his body and the black layer disappeared without a trace. His body then returned to its original form.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie was also stunned? in actuality, he didn't do anything and only blankly looked at Luo Luo Zheng, at a loss as to what to do.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's first sword strike had severed Barrie's Heavenly Destiny while his second strike directly landed on Barrie's head.</p>

  <p>Under the Great Weighty Sword's heavy pressure, Barrie's head was sliced into pieces before his headless corpse fell towards the ground.</p>

  <p>And so, Luo Luo Zheng killed the first Supreme Lord of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe my eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng killed a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race in a single strike!"</p>

  <p>"What's with that cyan light?"</p>

  <p>Within the Dead Water World, the many Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe were no longer able to hold themselves back.</p>

  <p>According to Master Feng, if the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race chose to act at this time, they would provide assistance immediately. But Master Feng gave no reaction? he merely stared at Luo Luo Zheng in the Sunflower Water World, his eyes revealing an indescribable expression.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng had killed a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race, stunning all the rest. No one could understand what technique he had just used.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes were as calm as ever. As he looked at Maha, an idea suddenly came to him. He wasn't in a hurry to kill this Godly Genius but rather to use the Great Weighty Sword to strike Maha's forehead. A massive power poured into his head, severely injuring Maha's soul, putting him into a coma.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Immediately afterward, another blood-red space crack appeared not too far away.</p>

  <p>As soon as the figure in the crack was revealed, Luo Luo Zheng pulled Maha forward, the Great Weighty Sword in his hand swinging out once more.</p>

  <p>Two slashes!</p>

  <p>With the first sword attack, Luo Luo Zheng cut off the Heavenly Destiny of the Supreme Lord using the Causality Breaking Light.</p>

  <p>The second sword strike was filled with boundless power. With the power of the Great Weighty Sword, it crushed the Supreme Lord heavily.</p>

  <p>It was quite a pity that before Supreme Lord Noel could even say anything, he was already smashed to smithereens. Even as he died, he would never be able to rest in peace.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng killed the second Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng beheaded Supreme Lord Noel, the third Supreme Lord of the Sacred race also used Grand Teleportation and crawled out from another bloody-red space crack.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng did just the same without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>His first sword strike cut off the Supreme Lord's Heavenly Destiny and the second strike killed him. It would seem that in Luo Zheng's hands, these Supreme Lords were no different from ordinary world lords. With his strength, how easy it was for him to kill an ordinary world lord!</p>

  <p>In less than twelve seconds, three Supreme Lords had fallen to death in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had died unjustly? as they were working for Maha, it was natural for them to protect him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed very powerful in their eyes. But there was still a large gap between him and a Supreme Lord. In their eyes, Just Supreme Lord Barrie alone was enough to withstand Luo Zheng's attack. The other two could work together and take Luo Luo Zheng down.</p>

  <p>The second and third Supreme Lords failed to notice Luo Zheng's movements in the Sunflower Water World, nor did they know that Luo Luo Zheng had already killed Supreme Lord Barrie. They had only closely followed Barrie's Grand Teleportation, so before they could even react, Luo Luo Zheng slaughtered them in succession.</p>

  <p>Originally, another two Supreme Lords had wanted to use Grand Teleportation to get there. But they had slowed down a touch to catch a glimpse of the inconceivable scene in the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>All the while, all the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race could feel their bodies stiffen.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The vibrations of the heavens were transmitted through their Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>Just how intense were the tremors caused by the deaths of three Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>At the time, there were only around fifty Supreme Lords of the Sacred race that had attacked the Evolutionary Universe. But there were still nearly a hundred Supreme Lords that were on standby in the Murphy Universe. These Supreme Lords all felt the heavens tremble simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Our Supreme Lords have been killed!"</p>

  <p>"Three Supreme Lords of our race were killed in a row. Was it the decisive battle between our race and the humankind?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. The Grand Supreme Lord has no intention of attacking yet."</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race attacked the Evolutionary Universe, everything had gone smoothly. They hadn't considered any serious obstacles and not a single Supreme Lord had been killed. But in comparison, a few Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe had already lost their lives? the difference in the strength of both sides became clear.</p>

  <p>At this moment, three Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were gone. It brought great shock and suspicion to the Sacred race, and they were itching to know just how these Supreme Lords had died.</p>

  <p>With one hand, Luo Luo Zheng held onto Maha's neck and lifted him, unconscious, into the air. His other hand held the Great Weighty Sword as he pointed it towards the depths of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>The Causality Breaking Light slowly revolved around the sword and its clear and misty light was rather pleasing to the eyes. Yet to the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, it was like the light emitted by the Grim Reaper.</p>

  <p>It was a silent provocation.</p>

  <p>In the Sunflower Water World, only the sound of the wind could be heard.</p>

  <p>The world lords of the Sacred race hid within the broken Iron Moon City, not uttering a single word, letting disbelief overtake them.</p>

  <p>The human world lords and those of the other races of the Evolutionary Universe could feel their hearts fill with excitement and joy. Luo Luo Zheng managed to kill three Supreme Lords in an instant. His strong performance was extremely encouraging.</p>

  <p>"Good news! Luo Luo Zheng killed three Supreme Lords of the Sacred race in a row. Haha!"</p>

  <p>A bold ogre world lord activated a Roaring Token, allowing his voice to resound throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>When the countless living creatures in the Evolutionary Universe heard the news, they were all in complete disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't Luo Luo Zheng fighting Maha?"</p>

  <p>"How come I haven't heard the news of him killing Maha? He killed three Supreme Lords instead?"</p>

  <p>"Just how strong is a Supreme Lord? I've never seen one in my life!"</p>

  <p>"Three Supreme Lords! A Supreme Lord is the strongest existence in the universe!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has such strength?"</p>

  <p>Most of the mortals couldn't understand what sort of existence a Supreme Lord really was. Even world lords, Soul Sea Realm warriors, Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, and Spirit Transformation Realm warriors were rather vague concepts in their minds, and they couldn't carefully distinguish the difference in their strength.</p>

  <p>But all they needed to know was that Luo Luo Zheng had killed three Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>When the ogre world lord's voice was transmitted throughout the entire universe, Master Feng felt the Evolution Lotus Flower in his hand suddenly sink. The momentum in the Evolutionary Universe had increased twofold.</p>

  <p>The momentum of the universe was constantly changing. After the invasion of the Sacred race three years ago, the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe continued to weaken. Before Nathan was killed, it had weakened to a fifth of its original state.</p>

  <p>Because of Nathan's death, it suddenly rose to the same level as it had been before the invasion of the Sacred race. Now it even rose to the peak.</p>

  <p>Such meant that all the living creatures within the Evolutionary Universe were quite optimistic about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race no longer dared to act so rashly.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng, their lives could be harvested in an instant, it seemed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they lacked any way to deal with him. Luo Luo Zheng had ambushed the three Supreme Lords when he killed them, after all. If the Supreme Lords managed to keep a certain distance from Luo Luo Zheng, they could stay safe.</p>

  <p>But the strange method Luo Luo Zheng had used was intimidating, to say the least.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this Maha your Godly Genius? Not a single Supreme Lord of the Sacred race dares to take him away?" As Luo Luo Zheng said it, a relaxed smile remained on his face. He used the Roaring Token to utter the words.</p>

  <p>But he gained no reply from the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, I won't show him any mercy." Then, a fierce light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes as he tossed the unconscious Maha away like he weighed nothing. The Great Weighty Sword slashed at him while his body had lost any form of protection. Under the impact of such fierce power, Luo Zheng's sword sliced him into pieces.</p>
