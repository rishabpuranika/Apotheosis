<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The majority of the top-level war lords were found to be on the fourteenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Among these war lords, only the most outstanding ones could enter the fifteenth floor. They must compete with each other and the ones who won could obtain a seat. And each seat owner had an independent space on the fifteenth floor, and that was equivalent to a small world.</p>

  <p>But the big problem was that there were only fourteen of them, even if all the top-level war lords of the human race were counted together, including Fabian, Jarrod, and two other seat owners.</p>

  <p>Fabian was knocked unconscious by this sudden bliss. They were almost there but worry filled him at that moment as there weren't so many top-level war lords to be seat owners.</p>

  <p>After contemplating about it, he then decided to ask for Luo Zheng's opinion secretly with the use of his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The solution Luo Luo Zheng came up with was a simple and straightforward one. He advised that if the top-level war lords weren't enough, then Fabian must consider the level nine war lords as possible seat owners. Supposed they still couldn't suffice, then level eight war lords would do.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, the seats were eventually given to top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>Fabian wouldn't let level nine or level eight war lords be seat owners. He had still managed somehow to get several top-level war lords from the Purple Heart Sacred Place to take the seats. After all, in the vast sacred place, the number of top-level war lords was still not few.</p>

  <p>After dealing with this matter, Luo Luo Zheng finally made a trip to the Purple Heart Sacred Place under Fabian's invitation.</p>

  <p>He felt glad to accept such an invitation. He had never entered the Purple Heart Sacred Place before, even though he was human.</p>

  <p>But never did it occur to him that his fame in the Purple Heart Sacred Place was enough to make everyone know him!</p>

  <p>The elders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had long started to publicize him the moment he made his debut in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Luo Zheng was a formidable war fighter. He had even defeated war generals of the other races. Humans could finally hold their heads high.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had confidently told the tens of millions of human warriors in the sacred place that Luo Zheng's appearance would likely bring them a new seat.</p>

  <p>One more seat would give the humans more right to speak, as well as five more licenses to the Dark Nether Cave. It purely brought humans hope!</p>

  <p>So everyone's attention was focused on Luo Luo Zheng. His impressive performance was like soaring into the sky. He was like a breeze air that could revive the tiny dot of hope from anyone's heart. And with his strength alone, he had taken control of the entire Tower of Sin in no time! Thus it was no longer a question of one more seat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance had greatly exceeded everyone's expectations!</p>

  <p>The attacks from the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, however, made some people within the Purple Heart Sacred Place feel disheartened and start to question and distrust Luo Luo Zheng. But their emotions quickly stabilized after the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place took humans' side.</p>

  <p>And now, Luo Luo Zheng had successfully chased away all of the ogres within the Tower of Sin. This nightmare that used to lie atop the heads of humans and haunt them had quickly dissipated into nothingness.</p>

  <p>No one knew how many humans had been brutally killed by the ogres in the Tower of Sin. The humans' sufferings were indeed unspeakable. But now, they were thrilled. Luo Luo Zheng had suppressed the ogres on his own.</p>

  <p>A day later, Luo Luo Zheng, Olivia, and a few other seat owners passed through the Cursed Land and arrived at the Purple Heart Sacred Place via transmission array.</p>

  <p>The transmission array of the Purple Heart Sacred Place was built at the top of a tall mountain, where Luo Luo Zheng was currently standing as he swept his eyes over the view.</p>

  <p>The moment he appeared, a loud sound wave came from the front and shocked him. "Luo Luo Zheng! Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng!" These humans looked at him from afar and cheered nonstop as if some great hero had returned from a victorious battle and everyone seemed to be celebrating by chanting his name.</p>

  <p>Olivia, who silently stood beside Luo Luo Zheng, had a sweet smile on her face. Her soft and plump body was deliberately moving towards him.</p>

  <p>It was said that beauties loved heroes. She knew that this gentle feeling of fondness began when Luo Luo Zheng had met Elder Jing the first time. When Luo Luo Zheng had released his soul force to drive the two ogre war lords away, Olivia's heart was beating wildly with admiration.</p>

  <p>It was only a pity that she could not guess Luo Zheng's attitude towards her. And with his mysterious identity, she gradually came to understand that he would not be able to stay on the Sea God Continent for long.</p>

  <p>Where did Luo Luo Zheng come from?</p>

  <p>Olivia tried to guess it a thousand times in her mind. Unfortunately, the Sea God Continent was a relatively closed-off place. Even after searching through history, she couldn't find any trace of it. She couldn't find any possible clues at all.</p>

  <p>If he suddenly left one day, would she be reluctant to part with him? A hint of sadness appeared on her face while the other humans cheered and shouted for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this time, three rays of light appeared in the sky snapping her out of her deep thoughts. The leader was seen riding on a flying sword and swiftly heading towards them.</p>

  <p>That person looked to be in his early forties, and he was quite handsome, as though he was an immortal.</p>

  <p>From the Mu Ning that they were emitting, Luo Luo Zheng immediately understood that these three people were all warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. The one leading them was naturally the leader of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Miguel.</p>

  <p>Olivia had previously explained in detail to Luo Luo Zheng that the old men beside Miguel were the former leaders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. They were Dan Sikong and Xavier Li.</p>

  <p>Miguel stood on top of the mountain peak and bowed towards Luo Luo Zheng. "I've heard a great deal about you, Luo Luo Zheng. Today, you are finally here. And you are indeed a superb young man!"</p>

  <p>"You flatter me!" Luo Luo Zheng responded with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Distinguished guest, please come to the main palace to talk."</p>

  <p>After exchanging greetings, everyone headed for the main hall of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>This was the second sacred place that Luo Luo Zheng had been to.</p>

  <p>Being able to be called a sacred place, it naturally had an area much larger than a fifth-grade or a fourth-grade sect. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng realized that there was no ordinary human in the sacred place. All of them were warriors.</p>

  <p>It was easy to understand the reason why.</p>

  <p>The environment on the Sea God Continent was entirely different from that of the Central Region. So to speak, the Central Region was almost controlled by humans. Even if they were to fight, it would still be battles between the various large sects. Even if they were to launch a sect war, the commoners would still be living their own lives, and would not have much interaction with the warriors.</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent, on the other hand, was dwelled upon with many races, and the natural selection rules were extremely exquisite. Humans were weak, to begin with, so the room to survive was so small.</p>

  <p>Back to the central area of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, there was a rule that flying was prohibited here. However, under Miguel's lead, Luo Luo Zheng and the others naturally didn't have to obey this rule.</p>

  <p>They flew towards the main palace, which was built on a gentle hillside.</p>

  <p>With a paved layer of white jade on its entire hillside, the palace looked celestial in the sky.</p>

  <p>On both sides of the main palace, there were the talents of a younger generation belonging to the human race.</p>

  <p>Although these people's cultivation levels were not that high, their talents were all one in ten thousand. To cultivate more warriors, the Purple Heart Sacred Place would filter out all the talents every year and carefully train them until they became war generals. Then, they would be sent to the Cursed Land to further cultivate in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, as the number of seats under the control of the human race increased, these young people probably wouldn't need to wait to become the war generals to enter the Tower of Sin. It was presumed that they could enter the tower even when they were just war fighters. The humans' environment in the tower had been greatly improved. That meant that the other races wouldn't dare to torture and kill human war fighters like they used to do.</p>

  <p>"Look, that's Luo Luo Zheng. I saw him on the Picture Slab! "</p>

  <p>"Although he is only a war general, those war lords are not his match!"</p>

  <p>"Olivia is actually following behind him. Do you think she will marry him?"</p>

  <p>As Olivia heard their words, she felt her face heated immediately. Miguel and the others could only smile when these words reached their ears. In their eyes, marriage was about fate.</p>

  <p>Among these young talents, there was a 14-year-old child. As he intently watched Luo Luo Zheng fly by, his red face flickered with a strange luster. He remained silent, but at this moment, his warrior spirit was constantly gathering an intense obsession. There was a grim determination raging within him.</p>

  <p>'In the future, I will definitely become someone like Luo Luo Zheng!' he screamed in his mind.</p>

  <p>In fact, after a few years, he did it. He became the second person in the Tower of Sin to be recognized by the Celestial Position race. This was because he had the same fate as Luo Luo Zheng. But this was also another story.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng was entering the main palace. He was treated rightfully as a distinguished guest. All the humans regarded him with respect and admiration.</p>

  <p>It was already a distinction and an honor to be entertained like this by warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. However, this was not the first time Luo Luo Zheng had experienced it. The situation in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was even more outrageous than this.</p>

  <p>After fully settling themselves, Miguel and Luo Luo Zheng began to discuss the matters of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Miguel wasn't picky about Luo Zheng's arrangements at all. With the permanent seats secured, the human race didn't need to worry about losing control of the Tower of Sin. Not to mention that Luo Luo Zheng had even dragged the Demon Night into this.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I guess you are planning to leave the Sea God Continent, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Miguel asked.</p>

  <p>It was not hard to guess. As long as Luo Luo Zheng stayed in the Tower of Sin for one day, no one in the tower would be able to resist him. His arrangement, however, was created obviously to prevent the decline of the human race once he left the Tower of Sin. He had further linked the human race with the Demon Night. With that, humans would be much safer.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed the case," Luo Luo Zheng nodded and openly admitted it. "I am afraid that I will have to leave after exploring the Dark Nether Cave. Therefore, I have come here to ask you about the secrets of the Dark Nether Cave! "</p>
