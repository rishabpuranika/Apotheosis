  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had burned the Eye of Will, the Truth of Divine Dao that carried it was now vacant, which was the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. It was just what Luo Zheng had wanted, and he felt fortunate that fate was even helping him.</p>

  <p>In addition, he also wanted to take away the Civilization Artifact of the Evil God. The Evil God didn't seem to be upset about it, and at this point he just let Luo Zheng do whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>In any case, Luo Zheng didn't intend to ask for the Evil God's consent anyway. He simply moved the Civilization Artifact on his own.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The cube vibrated for a short while when it was moved, then it flew straight out of the Rebirth Land. Aside from this object, he also took away the gem with the arc light from the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>There should be a lot of good things in the Evil God's hands. For instance, the black dragon-patterned broken blade was a treasure with an extraordinary origin.</p>

  <p>These things, however, were useless to Luo Zheng, so he didn't bother to plunder the treasures from the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Once he had gotten the two most important items, the last thing that remained was how to deal with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>A shiver ran down Edna's spine when she saw that Luo Zheng's gaze fell on her husband. Although Luo Zheng had said that he would not kill him, who could stop him if he suddenly changed his mind?</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng pointed towards a mountain below.</p>

  <p>The mountain rose from the ground like a fast growing tree and grew up to three hundred thousand feet high. It didn't stop until the top of the mountain touched Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, the top of the mountain became flattened. Golden red pillars were formed out of thin air. They lined up in formation until they turned into a spacious prison.</p>

  <p>To refine the Evil God into an Inner-world Generating Avatar was a good choice, but in fact, the Evil God's talent was his own and was innate to him.</p>

  <p>So, it would be a waste if he was refined into an avatar without any consciousness.</p>

  <p>In light of this, Luo Zheng would try to find a way to make the Evil God become an Inner-world Generating Avatar and at the same time, he would be able to keep his own consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, who was under his control, would be a great help to him. Luo Zheng wouldn't take the risk to release him as he might kill anyone recklessly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God knew what he had to do. He went inside the prison, followed by Edna.</p>

  <p>Since her husband had made a mistake, she was willing to bear the consequence with him.</p>

  <p>The door of the prison closed shut with a loud thud, then Luo Zheng and the other two flew away.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood behind the bars. His eyes looked down at the world in the distance.</p>

  <p>As the human kingdoms were still in battle with each other, he saw the horses gallop, long spears that penetrated the bodies of the warriors, and blood that flowed like a river?</p>

  <p>Yesterday he was still the master of the world, and today he became its prisoner. When Edna noticed that the Evil God was quiet, she moved closer to him.</p>

  <p>"Darling..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God held her in his arms while his eyes were still fixed on the war in the distance, still immersed in his past glory and unwilling to look away.</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful sight when animals kill each another, isn't it?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's very beautiful," Edna agreed with a nod. She knew that her husband would not admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Even death could not make him admit defeat, let alone while he was still alive.</p>

  <p>That was one of the reasons Edna was obsessed with this man.</p>

  <p>However?</p>

  <p>It was unwise to oppose their Creator.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had moved the Civilization Artifact all the way from the Rebirth Land to the center of his inner world.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng took back the Rebirth Land, the Civilization Artifact was actually merged with the Evil God. Thus, he was unable to control it and needed to merge with it himself.</p>

  <p>If this piece of Civilization Artifact had its own consciousness and didn't acknowledge Luo Zheng, it should cut the connection between them and return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Only those who had used a Civilization Artifact knew how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Civilization was still suppressed in Stage Thirteen. If the entire civilization rose from the Desire World to the Desire World, its power would increase again. Furthermore, the world he could summon would endow him more incredible power.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization just got to Stage Ten but the power it released was impressive. The potential it would have in the future would help Luo Zheng immensely.</p>

  <p>Without much words, Luo Zheng began to recite the Truth of Goodwill and Malice in his heart.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>When the truth aura began to spread, his inner world trembled slightly and the Sanskrit words along its boundaries lit up in succession.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred and seventy two Sanskrit words lit up..."</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit looked rather unconvinced as he observed the shining Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng had previously merged with the Civilization Artifact of the Green Jade Civilization, three hundred and sixty six Sanskrit words lit up.</p>

  <p>The unknown Heavenly Obsession Civilization actually used three hundred and seventy two Sanskrit words to merge with it, which meant that the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was indeed superior to that of the Green Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The golden light on the surface of the Sanskrit words continuously flashed and turned into thick chains once again. All the chains struck at the Civilization Artifact like huge snakes, and firmly locked it inside.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact had no intent of resisting. In fact, the entire process of merging with it was rather easy.</p>

  <p>As the chains gradually disappeared, Luo Zheng felt that he had established some sort of connection with the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>At that point, a cold and emotionless voice was heard from the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"The tasks-guiding process has been started..."</p>

  <p>"The tasks are ready. Do you want to receive tasks?"</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit, No. 9527, and Luo Zheng looked at each other, before Luo Zheng answered, "Yes."</p>

  <p>After he agreed, the cold voice continued, "Heaven-level first-class task, kill Fuxi. After completing the mission, you can have the Innate Seal, which could be used to merge with Fuxi's Dark and Light..."</p>

  <p>"Heaven-level first-class task, defeat the Thunder Dimorphodon. After you have completed it, you will have the Eternal Chain, which could help you completely subdue the Thunder Dimorphodon."</p>

  <p>"Heaven-level second-class task, hijack the Black Ship. After you have completed the task, you will have..."</p>

  <p>"Heaven-level..."</p>

  <p>The three of them were dumbfounded when they heard it announce a series of tasks.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng took these tasks, it would be exactly like courting death.</p>

  <p>Yet, after the tasks were issued, he could choose not to accept them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he just listened quietly.</p>

  <p>From the way these tasks were issued, the Civilization Artifact should have been spying on the surrounding environment at all times. Then, it issued tasks according to the things that existed in the environment and offered the corresponding rewards.</p>

  <p>"I can also issue these tasks," the Green Jade Spirit said in disbelief. "But where did it get those rewards? Can this thing really give the rewards it has promised?"</p>

  <p>Forget about whether Luo Zheng was able to kill Fuxi or not. It was absolutely impossible for him to defeat the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was the Human Sovereign. His control of the Dark and Light energies was far beyond an ordinary person's imagination. It could be said that even among the strongest warriors, Fuxi was the most powerful in terms of the cultivation on the Dark and Light energies!</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was able to defeat Fuxi, this Civilization Artifact would give him the so-called "Innate Seal", which could be used to merge with Fuxi's Dark and Light energies...</p>

  <p>It sounded truly unbelievable.</p>

  <p>And, it was the same with the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>Each of the top ten beasts of the chaos had their own missions and abilities.</p>

  <p>These beasts were not as powerful as the Chaos Ancient Gods, but they weren't weaker than the strongest warriors either. As it happened, they were even stronger than some of those strongest warriors.</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine that after such a powerful being was defeated, one just had to rely on an Eternal Chain to subdue it?</p>

  <p>What a crazy fantasy!</p>
