<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1710 Sharpen The Sword Skill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianming looked incredulously at the scene playing out in front of him.</p>

  <p>He found it hard to accept his own speculations about it.</p>

  <p>He believed that Luo Luo Zheng was very talented and would be slightly stronger than him, but he didn't expect the gap between him and Luo Luo Zheng to be so great!</p>

  <p>He had tried his best to comprehend and cultivate the Beginning Swordsmanship for twenty years before he finally began to grasp a little bit of it.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng, too, had grasped it a little bit after only exchanging a few sword strikes with him.</p>

  <p>Tianming naturally didn't know that as Luo Luo Zheng kept on comprehending, he had taken the simplest sword skill as his foundation and gradually progressed from there.</p>

  <p>And the sword skill contained in the Gods-intimidating Strike had the same origins as that of the Beginning Swordsmanship...</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming fought each other, their strikes formed a complementary momentum, and Luo Luo Zheng gradually comprehended the momentum contained within the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>"Since you intend to gain comprehension, I will share this opportunity with you!"</p>

  <p>In terms of moves, Tianming already had the upper hand with his superior swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>This formidable swordsmanship was created not long after the world formed and developed among the primordial chaos. It was the foundation of all the sword skills between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Following this, numerous kinds of sword skills developed based on the primary one and spread everywhere...</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's sword skill was extremely simple, it had lost its momentum!</p>

  <p>Tianming regarded Luo Luo Zheng as his greatest opponent and rightly so.</p>

  <p>However, during the skirmish, he didn't care about the fact that Luo Luo Zheng comprehended the Beginning Swordsmanship...</p>

  <p>His attacks were as sharp and aggressive as ever.</p>

  <p>However, his speed had slowed down by 60 percent and his strength had decreased by a whopping 30 percent!</p>

  <p>At this point, the purpose of the battle was not competing on sword moves, but rather gaining comprehension together by sparring with each other!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng realized Tianming's motivation, a peculiar look appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>This was not to say that Tianming would definitely win if he had the advantage in moves.</p>

  <p>But Tianming was a stickler for rules. He held an advantage in sword moves, but refused to use this advantage to break through. He was a true gentleman in that sense!</p>

  <p>This was Tianming's principle and way of cultivation, and he stood up for his principles!</p>

  <p>He had a good sense of right and wrong and was in favor of playing fairly.</p>

  <p>"What in God's name are these two doing..."</p>

  <p>"Their attacks have suddenly slowed down. It seems like neither of them has any intention of winning. Are they here just to practice the sword skills together?"</p>

  <p>"Their swordsmanship is so exquisite!"</p>

  <p>The onlookers were quite confused...</p>

  <p>Anyone would put up their best fight on the Heaven Earth Board...</p>

  <p>The more battles they won, the more power they would gain. All the warriors fought for high rankings in the world of chaos. The higher the rankings they obtained, the greater their chances would improve in the future!</p>

  <p>Everyone was scratching their heads wondering why Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng were just practicing the sword skills together during a competition.</p>

  <p>"Just what are they doing?" Xenia asked in a daze.</p>

  <p>Her state of mind wasn't affected when she was kicked out of the competition by Tianming. On the contrary, she admired him...</p>

  <p>"If my guess is right, the swordsmanship that Tianming has cultivated is also incomplete. This sword technique is also very weird. After the sword strike becomes the simplest one, it has the momentum of a divine weapon!" a Supreme Lord from the Celestial Position explained flatly.</p>

  <p>"What's terrifying is that Luo Luo Zheng has actually grasped this kind of momentum not long after fighting with Tianming. He has comprehended it himself... Haha, this sort of talent can't even be described as terrifying.</p>

  <p>After all, this guy has obtained the golden Celestial Position title!</p>

  <p>However, this guy doesn't seem to be very obedient. The head of our race asked Luo Luo Zheng to meet him, but he hasn't gone to meet him in the past few years," another Supreme Lord from the Celestial Position remarked coldly.</p>

  <p>After staring at Luo Luo Zheng for a while, the Supreme Lord, who made the earlier comments, nodded and replied, "I think Tianming has also encountered a bottleneck in his swordsmanship. He exchanges sword moves with Luo Luo Zheng just to impart his own swordsmanship to Luo Luo Zheng. After that, he will try to make a breakthrough by taking advantage of Luo Zheng's cultivation."</p>

  <p>This Supreme Lord was indeed so prodigious that he was capable of seeing through Tianming's thoughts even when he was unable to figure out the origins of the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Other than trying to pursue the balance, Tianming indeed had this exact same thought in his mind.</p>

  <p>Up till now, he had only practiced the Beginning Swordsmanship with limited success and acquired 50 percent of the momentum within the sword strike. It would be difficult for him to achieve a breakthrough again!</p>

  <p>The only thing that supported this sword technique was a piece of bright jade.</p>

  <p>If it was stimulated with life vitality, there would be a tall and sturdy virtual figure, which would pick up a sword and practice the sword skill...</p>

  <p>For the past three hundred years, it would appear once in the morning and once in the evening. Each time, it only stayed for thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>Tianming was comprehending the sword skill purely through observation!</p>

  <p>He followed suit after watching the figure demonstrate the swordplay.</p>

  <p>Given the extremely short period of time, he was unable to find someone with whom to exchange sword moves during the cultivation.</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword skill still needed to be honed, just like a good saber, which needed to be sharpened on a whetstone.</p>

  <p>But he had been unable to find such a 'whetstone' on which to sharpen his skills. It was impossible for him to find it in the Lower World or in the universe!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was able to grasp a bit of the momentum of the Beginning Swordsmanship, then Tianming would use him to sharpen his swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Of course, fencing had always been about polishing each other's skills!</p>

  <p>In this exchange, the benefits to Luo Luo Zheng were also obvious...</p>

  <p>What astonished Tianming the most was that Luo Luo Zheng was able to comprehend 20 to 30 percent of the Beginning Swordsmanship in such a short span of time.</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't have this idea from the start. However, after they had fought for a short while, Luo Luo Zheng had begun to master the swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>This fueled Tianming's confidence that he could take advantage of Luo Luo Zheng to sharpen his own skills!</p>

  <p>He did not care about how Luo Luo Zheng would make it; he only knew that his idea was feasible!</p>

  <p>"Ding, Clang, ping..."</p>

  <p>The two of them seemed to be the beginners and had just learned the basics of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>They skillfully swung the swords using different sword plays, such as stab sword, circle parry, withdraw sword and raise sword...</p>

  <p>Those warriors, who could detect the momentum within, watched them with great fascination. This sort of momentum seemed to be similar to the ordinary ones. But if one were to carefully think about it, it would truly be thrilling!</p>

  <p>However, there were many warriors in this universe who were completely confused judging by the puzzled expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Are these two crazy?"</p>

  <p>"Even children know this basic sword technique. Isn't this a colossal waste of time?"</p>

  <p>"15 minutes have already passed, but they are still..."</p>

  <p>Thankfully, there seemed to be no time limit on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses were surprisingly patient as well, and no one urged Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng on...</p>

  <p>As he continued to spar with Tianming, Luo Zheng's understanding of the sword techniques became clearer and clearer.</p>

  <p>It was as if his proficiency over the sword had elevated to a higher level!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>He lifted his sword and stabbed Tianming with it.</p>

  <p>The momentum of the Beginning Swordsmanship had increased by leaps and bounds...</p>

  <p>'He has already comprehended 30 percent. That was fast!'</p>

  <p>Tianming was slightly startled. He was already familiar with this skill. His sword was raised a bit and deflected Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>'How long would it take Luo Luo Zheng to master 50 percent of the sword skill like me?' His eyes gleamed with anticipation...</p>

  <p>The number of sword moves the two warriors had exchanged had already reached three thousand.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming were high on energy at this moment, and neither seemed tired or ready to give up.</p>

  <p>With every thrust of his sword, Luo Luo Zheng was grasping more and more comprehension.</p>

  <p>This opportunity for a miraculous enlightenment such as this was not something most people would encounter in their entire lives...</p>

  <p>30 percent...</p>

  <p>40 percent...</p>

  <p>50 percent...</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended 50 percent of the Beginning Swordsmanship aided by Tianming's demonstration, it was considered small success!</p>

  <p>In the past, Tianming had cultivated the sword skill for three hundred years, though it was only three years to the outside world. Compared to Tianming's cultivation speed, Luo Zheng's was innumerably faster!</p>

  <p>Talent was just one of the factors, but the main reason why Luo Luo Zheng could master the sword skill so fast was that the Beginning Swordsmanship was compatible with Luo Zheng's sword technique!</p>

  <p>Rather it was almost exactly the same.</p>

  <p>He just simplified every complicated move.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had mastered 50 percent of the Beginning Swordsmanship, his sword began to resonate with this sharp sound!</p>

  <p>An invisible Mu Ning spread out in all directions, filling the entire Heaven Earth Board...</p>

  <p>The warriors outside of the painting could hear the sound, but they couldn't see nor feel its Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>However, the other eight warriors on the stones of the Heaven Earth Board seemed to have fallen into an illusion created among the chaos.</p>

  <p>The oppressive Mu Ning was not strong, but it gave Nathan and the others a wondrous experience. Not only was the Mu Ning grand and imposing, but it also broadened their perceptions.</p>

  <p>"What has this guy comprehended? His Mu Ning is so overbearing!" Lawson spat indignantly. He was influenced by Luo Luo Zheng even when he was standing on a stone. He was irked by this.</p>

  <p>"Surely, he must have made a breakthrough on the sword skill!" Nathan said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Before that Mu Ning spread, Tianming had already retreated several hundred feet back. He cupped his hands and yelled at Luo Luo Zheng, "Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Luo Luo Zheng nodded, quietly feeling the wonderful momentum humming.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome. I did it all for myself..." Tianming smiled faintly as he raised his sword.</p>

  <p>He knew very well that if there was no shield in this world that could block the sword, then the sword might be useless.</p>
