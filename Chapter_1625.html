<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Jeffrey was undoubtedly lucky to have obtained the Dipamkara Buddha's guidance.</p>

  <p>He had once failed in becoming a fully-fledged ace talent before.</p>

  <p>But this time, he had the Dipamkara Buddha to help him comprehend the secrets of cultivating an indestructible body.</p>

  <p>The numerous arhats Luo Zheng fought in the ancient temple all ended up recovering after being destroyed because they were able to rely on the Past Solemn Kalpa's power.</p>

  <p>That was exactly what Jeffrey comprehended.</p>

  <p>The things they found in the Corridor of Emperor were all extremely rare and valuable, which made them extremely happy.</p>

  <p>True Gods' soul marks were in those torches. It was extremely rare for anybody in this universe to be able to find a True God.</p>

  <p>But the soul marks were already good enough and made it seem as if it was the True God himself that guided them on their way.</p>

  <p>Minutes after Jeffrey came out, someone laughed heartily in the corridor.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Have you all passed?"</p>

  <p>Coleman asked, also walking out from the corridor with a big, happy smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He had to hunch a bit since his big, muscular body had to fit through the ten-feet high corridor.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think it would be so easy to pass through the fifth hall. The torches' illusions were frightening but were actually useless..." he said with a smug look on his face.</p>

  <p>His words surprised everyone present.</p>

  <p>The fifth Hall of Causality was not a test.</p>

  <p>Because they would all pass no matter what they did.</p>

  <p>In the process of exploring the corridor, all of them had to rely on their own means to try to understand the auras that emanated from the True Gods. This fifth hall was, in fact, a great training opportunity.</p>

  <p>"How did you pass through?" Janet asked Coleman.</p>

  <p>The ogre shrugged. "When I got sucked into the illusion, I just kept on running. When I ran, I managed to get rid of the flames. There were some times when I thought I was going to die but I always managed to leave the illusion just in time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Jeffrey, Hailey, and Janet were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>The True Gods' soul marks would've also been astonished if they heard what he just said.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey patiently explained the value of the corridor to Coleman. The ogre was stunned in silence for a bit, probably processing what he had just been told, before letting out a huge scream and running back to the corridor.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, there was no way he could re-enter. The Corridor of Emperor was only a one-way path and going back was no longer an option.</p>

  <p>Ansel got out not long after. He did not intentionally restrain his Mu Ning but it was noticeably fainter. It seemed he also obtained some benefits from the corridor.</p>

  <p>Once everyone gathered in the circular hall, they set off again and continued their journey.</p>

  <p>Everyone was naturally in a good mood, except for Coleman of course.</p>

  <p>Beyond the exit was a circular hall where they found a round plate that shimmered with a faint, golden light.</p>

  <p>Around the plate were six, mysterious, pink dots of light that hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>"Ding..."</p>

  <p>There was a tinkling sound as the six dots flew towards them and floated just above their heads.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a thought was poured inside each warrior's mind.</p>

  <p>Everyone took the time to absorb this thought and digest it. After understanding the meaning behind it, all of them opened their eyes with a trace of ecstasy evident on their faces.</p>

  <p>"This even has the ability to make the illusion become real! This is the real reward!" Jeffrey marveled in surprise.</p>

  <p>Janet's face was also practically glowing in glee.</p>

  <p>The first time she entered the Hall of Causality, she was defeated and was directly sent back to the main city. There was no doubt that she was terribly depressed by that loss since she gambled away five million Illusion Points to enter.</p>

  <p>However, she did not give up and saved up more Illusion Points to enter it a second time.</p>

  <p>She didn't have that many Illusion Points and she could only hope that her persistence and hard work would be enough to carry her all the way to the end. Fortunately, it seemed as if her efforts were now paying-off.</p>

  <p>Coleman, on the other hand, was currently giggling to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared up at the pink dot with an astonished look on his face.</p>

  <p>This dot was an opportunity for them to bring out an item from the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Those within the Illusion Battlefield were only mere projections of their true selves. The person that existed within this space was only a copy or a duplicate of the real warrior.</p>

  <p>There existed a duplicate for each warrior in this world...</p>

  <p>Lucille, someone who had one soul in two bodies, essentially owned three duplicates of herself.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just their physical bodies. Their life vitality crystals, space rings, and other treasures would also be cloned.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey's Buddha Curse Blade would be copied with the original in the outside and a duplicate inside the Illusion Battlefield. The same could be said for Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword and Black Star.</p>

  <p>Once they left, their projections would disappear. The only thing they would end up with was the experience they gained there.</p>

  <p>However, the pink dots let them take out one of their belongings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, for instance, would be able to bring out the Thunder Wind Divine Sword out of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey would also be able to take out the Buddha Curse Blade.</p>

  <p>It was essentially a chance for everyone to copy a treasure!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in no hurry to copy his weapon. A first-rank divine weapon was powerful but one Thunder Wind Divine Sword was already enough for him. He had Livingston to forge him other unrivalled magical weapons anyway, so it wasn't really a big deal for him.</p>

  <p>However, Jeffrey's Buddha Curse Blade was different.</p>

  <p>His status in the entire Blessed Buddha Land wasn't low, and in fact, it was only second to the ace talents. However, he still lacked the qualifications to own a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>It was true that the clans all handed out their powerful treasures to the juniors in order to help them get a good ranking.</p>

  <p>But they would all have to return these splendid weapons after coming back from the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But this pink dot changed everything! With it, he could then bring out the Buddha Curse Blade and duplicate it!</p>

  <p>Jeffrey could hand over one but keep the other copy for himself!</p>

  <p>It was something that really made him overflow with joy! He took out the Buddha Curse Blade with no hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>There was a crisp, clean sound as the Buddha Curse Blade was unsheathed.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey then reached up to grab the pink dot in his hand and squeezed it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The dot easily shattered into specks of dust that floated towards the Buddha Curse Blade. As it scattered over the weapon, a small mark began to appear on its surface.</p>

  <p>This mark was extremely special, in that all items bearing it could be brought out of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was still thinking about what item he wanted to copy.</p>

  <p>He already had quite a few treasures.</p>

  <p>And he wasn't really in any hurry to duplicate any of them. It didn't help that his greatest weapon was, in fact, himself and there was no way he could duplicate himself. The pink dot had made it clear to him that he could only take out an item and not a person.</p>

  <p>'Item...' he pondered to himself for a moment.</p>

  <p>He probably spent a few seconds thinking before his eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>'I'm so stupid. Why must I only consider the items I've brought in?</p>

  <p>There's no need to duplicate any of them, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>There was no point duplicating the Thunder Wind Divine Sword or the Black Star. One was already enough for him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had a treasure that belonged to the Illusion Battlefield but would be extremely useful outside: the Teleportation Token!</p>

  <p>If he had that then he could basically travel anywhere he wanted in the entire universe instantly!</p>

  <p>He had been trapped in the fairy palace for six years, which was a really huge problem...</p>

  <p>However, if he had the Teleportation Token, then not even a Supreme Lord would be able to restrain him.</p>

  <p>The only thing he was having reservations with was the fact that the token only seemed to record the main cities of a supreme world within the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>He wasn't really sure if it could be used outside it.</p>

  <p>'I have no idea if this will work. This Teleportation Token is a special tool here in the Illusion Battlefield after all, ' he thought to himself but he still took the token out. He then reached up and crushed the pink dot. It was the same process as the dot shattered into numerous specks of dust and then floated towards his chosen item.</p>
