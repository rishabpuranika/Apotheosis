<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3678 Duplicating Gemstone </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tiger-shaped fist shadow zoomed and quickly rushed towards Emperor Di Jun. Because of the immense force, the surrounding space was constantly twisted and broken, forming a curved "bubble".</p>

  <p>As the "bubble" approached quickly, a worried expression finally took form in Emperor Di Jun's face. He squinted his eyes and clenched his fists, as if anticipating the incoming danger.</p>

  <p>He knew if this punch hit him, he would surely be smashed to pieces!</p>

  <p>The light in his eyes flickered and he tried to forcibly teleport away.</p>

  <p>However, those small squares disappeared as soon as they appeared. After being bitten by the black snake, he had lost the ability to escape!</p>

  <p>This was how the battle between the strong was like.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a warrior was in the Source World, they would still have setbacks if they were to encounter some special abilities. And indeed, Emperor Di Jun was in the middle of this situation.</p>

  <p>If the "Heart of Accomplice" hadn't been used to kill Ware before, Emperor Di Jun would have been dead by now.</p>

  <p>In the same way, Emperor Di Jun's Starlight Tracking Spear was also a very special killing weapon. This spear could only kill the people who were targeted by the Starlight Witness, and anyone who was targeted would be killed in one strike. That was how the Starlight Tracking Spear had directly killed the leaders of the several mountains before they could even react!</p>

  <p>But now, ironically, Emperor Di Jun was facing the same problem. The two warriors from the Ivory Mountain got close to him in a strange way, as if sneaking up to him. And then, one of them used the little black snake to bite him. Emperor Di Jun couldn't figure out the ability of the little black snake, so he couldn't break free from it. In addition to his already difficult and painful situation, with the powerful punch from Norbert, he was bound to die.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden and the others of the Taiyi Heaven Palace looked expectant.</p>

  <p>Of course, it would be great if Emperor Di Jun would be killed by this blow! A smirk was visible on their faces and their eyes were gleaming and hopeful.</p>

  <p>A trace of anxiety appeared on Emperor Di Jun's face. As he gritted his teeth, a small gemstone suddenly appeared from the spot between his eyebrows. This gemstone was also an Other Shore Token. After it appeared, it shot upwards.</p>

  <p>Just after the small gemstone left him, the tiger-shaped fist shadow had already approached him and hit his body head-on.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The eighteen million Jun of force was by no means something a physical body could resist.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of everyone around, Emperor Di Jun turned into a cloud of dust and quickly dissipated. The tiger-shaped fist shadow continued to fluctuate diagonally upwards, shooting into the distance.</p>

  <p>There were gasps and sighs of relief. "He made it!"</p>

  <p>"Emperor Di Jun just got killed?"</p>

  <p>"It's unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>A trace of joy appeared on the faces of the people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The scene they had witnessed before their own eyes was beyond their imaginations. It was simply unbelievable. Regardless, the people felt as though a burden had been lifted from their shoulders.</p>

  <p>The members of the Jin Wu, however, were silent. In their consciousness, the death of Emperor Di Jun was the biggest grief to them.</p>

  <p>Those members of the Bearing race all paled.</p>

  <p>They had been hoping for Emperor Di Jun to help them out. Who would have thought that the powerful Emperor Di Jun would be smashed into pieces by one punch?</p>

  <p>However, most of them had missed the gemstone that was flying in the air.</p>

  <p>After the gemstone flew away in a distance, it suddenly emitted a green light. The green light quickly became intense, and Emperor Di Jun, who had already been turned to dust, once again was reborn from the green light.</p>

  <p>The joy on the faces of the warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace was unmistakable. This happiness, however, only lasted for a few seconds before their expressions turned into astounded looks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was watching the scene from below, also had a puzzled expression in his eyes. He couldn't comprehend what had just happened.</p>

  <p>"It's so strange. Emperor Di Jun should already have been killed."</p>

  <p>The scene just now was definitely not an illusion. The tiger-shaped fist shadow clearly had smashed Emperor Di Jun into smithereens like crushing dry weeds.</p>

  <p>"Those who have entered Stage Thirty-three naturally have a couple of tricks up their sleeves to save their lives. That Duplicating Gemstone is not rare in the Heavenly Treasure Cave. It can perfectly duplicate oneself after being carried. It is equivalent to gaining an extra life," explained Houyi.</p>

  <p>"Duplicating Gemstone? Perfectly duplicate oneself?" Luo Zheng was stunned and confused. "Then if one gets a few more of the Duplicating Gemstones, won't that make them immortal?"</p>

  <p>This was something new to Luo Zheng: the ability to perfectly copy oneself. Such Other Shore Tokens were simply too powerful. And according to Houyi, there seemed to be a great number of them?</p>

  <p>"Everyone can only carry one of such gemstone. If it is used, then you will not be qualified to carry a second one," Emperor Di Jun in his mind added concisely.</p>

  <p>Such a treasure was precious, but everyone only had one chance to use it.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun had relied on the Duplicating Gemstone to avoid the calamity of death, and in this case, he had already used his one chance with the precious gemstone.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the people below him angrily, the muscles on his face stiff. "If it weren't for my special trick, I would have been killed by you on the spot today!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Starlight Tracking Spear in his hand shook again. It made an eerie buzzing sound, and then six rays of starlight descended.</p>

  <p>Norbert had collapsed and died because he had unleashed a too great power.</p>

  <p>The warrior who had taken out the little black snake was also burned to death together with the snake itself. This was a result of burning his Other Shore Token. Only the warrior who provided the Grand Hidden Leaf was still alive, and one of the six rays of starlight fell directly above that person's head.</p>

  <p>When the man saw the Starlight Witness above his head, all his blood left his face and he was dead pale. Out of instinct to escape, he swiftly raised the Grand Hidden Leaf. His aura was completely hidden, and he disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, the Starlight Witness followed him like a shadow. No matter which direction that invisible person moved to, the Starlight Witness also moved and followed. He would never be able to escape.</p>

  <p>"Since you have offended me, you must be prepared to die," Emperor Di Jun said as he shook the Starlight Tracking Spear. His tone was fierce and his eyes were sharp as blade.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>At the same time, six avatars of Emperor Di Jun appeared behind the six powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Then, six rays of spear radiance pierced through them.</p>

  <p>After killing the six people, Emperor Di Jun returned to his original position.</p>

  <p>It took a while before he was able to calm down and when he finally did, his face became cold and arrogant again. His eyes swept over the people below him slowly, as if he were meticulously judging each person. He was choosing a new target.</p>

  <p>When his eyes swept over Luo Zheng, he paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>It was this guy who had shot down his suns...</p>

  <p>It had cost him a lot of energy to use the Nine-Sun World Destruction token.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that he needed to help Divine Farmer and Xuanyuan, he wouldn't have used the Nine-Sun World Destruction token, nor would he encounter such a strange thing.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had successfully aroused his interest. Emperor Di Jun gave out a small smile and felt a bit excited.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't want to kill Luo Zheng this easily. On the one hand, he wanted to know what Luo Zheng had relied on to shoot down his suns. On the other hand, the group of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits was still in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Just as Emperor Di Jun was choosing the next group of targets to kill, Pearce moved his lips slightly and began to communicate with the powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Although Emperor Di Jun was undeniably powerful, he had his own weakness.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was impossible, and of course, illogical for these people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace to wait to be slaughtered like lambs.</p>

  <p>After a short discussion, Pearce's face suddenly looked determined. His expression was hard and his eyes were serious and sharp. He suddenly flew at Emperor Di Jun who was up in the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! The air blew as Pearce's body ascended.</p>

  <p>Led by Pearce, the other powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace also flew following him.</p>

  <p>If it was only one or two powerful warriors that came to fight him, Emperor Di Jun would not be afraid.</p>

  <p>But now that most of the people were rushing towards him, he naturally needed to act with caution.</p>

  <p>"A desperate struggle?"</p>

  <p>Disdain appeared on Emperor Di Jun's face. Just as he was about to fight them, the members of the Jin Wu also came flying straight for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't bear to see the strong warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace face Emperor Di Jun alone, so he gave the order to the members of the Jin Wu to attack him together.</p>
