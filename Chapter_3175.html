  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Zheng had absorbed that weight rune, he felt the giant stone suddenly double in weight to two hundred divine megatons.</p>

  <p>The increase of the stone's weight obviously would have an effect on the flexibility. But the boulder of the Origin Mountain and that of Feng Ge were also of the same weight; they could hit at the same starting point.</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eye, Zheng could see Feng Ge on the other side, cornering the stone of the Origin Mountain by using aggressive attacks.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard Jermain tried, he couldn't break Feng Ge's suppression.</p>

  <p>Dorothy and the others from the Origin Mountain also watched anxiously.</p>

  <p>At this point, only four sword sects remained. If they were kicked out of the game now, it would be a very disappointing loss indeed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked towards the metal mountain. She could see that Zheng was far away from them, preoccupied. He didn't seem to have the slightest intention of helping them. Dorothy squinted, trying to see what Zheng was doing. She gasped. He was actually rushing towards the second layer of the metal mountain!</p>

  <p>"That guy... he only cares about himself!" Dorothy pouted.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Jermain followed her gaze. His eyes gleamed and he chuckled. "He's not being selfish. He wants to save us!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Dorothy was still confused.</p>

  <p>Jermain gestured at Feng Ge, who was rushing towards him, and pointed to the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had always been arrogantly competitive. Once she was in the game, she would stop at nothing to reach first place. The Origin Mountain used to be the only thing standing in her way.</p>

  <p>But now Zheng was heading for the second layer, too. If this guy got the second weight rune, he would be able to reach the top of the metal mountain. There was no way Feng Ge would allow that!</p>

  <p>As soon as Feng Ge realized what was happening, she frowned deeply. With a flick of her wrist, she instantly turned the giant stone around and rushed towards the metal mountain. She was determined to stop Zheng from getting the second weight rune.</p>

  <p>Dorothy blinked confusedly. "Is Zheng really trying to save us?" Her eyes narrowed. "Or does he want to seize the chance to win the first place?"</p>

  <p>Jermain sighed exasperatedly. "My lady, does it matter? The most important thing is that we are still in the game!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy stood on the giant stone, still a bit upset. She mumbled, "Of course, it matters..."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Feng Ge was approaching Zheng fast.</p>

  <p>With her were the 19 best disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Their combined strength was naturally stronger than that of the other sword sects. The weight of this giant stone seemed to have little to no effect on them.</p>

  <p>Besides, Feng Ge herself was a strong warrior. She was confident she and her team would win first place.</p>

  <p>Zheng let the giant stone under his feet absorb the second weight rune slowly as he eyed Feng Ge steadily approaching.</p>

  <p>In fact, Jermain had been right. Zheng knew that Feng Ge wouldn't stand for him to absorb the second weight rune.</p>

  <p>Moreover, once the giant stone finished absorbing the second weight rune, its weight would double to 400 divine megatons. Zheng was concerned his control of the stone would be clumsier. He knew he wouldn't be able to deal with Feng Ge if that were the case.</p>

  <p>Just as Feng Ge's huge stone came within range, Zheng tapped his toe lightly.</p>

  <p>Instantly, his stone flipped, shooting upwards in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's huge stone hit the metal hard, and the huge impact even made the mountain quake.</p>

  <p>'How violent...' Zheng exclaimed inwardly, watching in amusement from his high spot.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, it's said that Feng Ge is also capable of Instant Enlightenment!"</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate her!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" the others behind Zheng cried.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng seemed talented enough to drive the stone with ease, he dared not underestimate Feng Ge's strength.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge remained stoic. Having missed her target, she refused to get frustrated.</p>

  <p>Instead, she looked towards Zheng calmly, and then mobilized her huge stone upwards to chase him.</p>

  <p>The giant stone of Flow Sword Sect was extremely nimble, and Feng Ge's stone was fast and aggressive. The two giant stones rolled up and down and spiraled in the air, like an eagle chasing an agile petrel.</p>

  <p>"That...is incredible... Feng Ge is awesome!"</p>

  <p>"There are only seven people in the Flow Sword Sect, mind you. Doesn't that make Zheng the better warrior?"</p>

  <p>"But, the giant stone of Flow Sword Sect does not even dare to collide with hers head on. Sooner or later, they will lose!"</p>

  <p>Many disciples had never thought that someone would be able to control the heavy stones to such an extent. They watched the two huge stones tango with twinkles in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Alas, it's a pity that we are too weak..."</p>

  <p>"If we hadn't fallen off the stone, we might still have a chance to strike back!"</p>

  <p>"We couldn't help Zheng..."</p>

  <p>The elites of Flow Sword Sect, who had been thrown off the stone, were remorseful. If they could work together with Zheng, then Feng Ge would not have been so threatening to them.</p>

  <p>"This is my fault," Konnor comforted them. "If I had asked Zheng to operate the stone from the very beginning, this would never have happened. Our sect would have already been the winner!"</p>

  <p>From the top of the cave</p>

  <p>The four people, including Goran and Athemar, were also enjoying the scene before them.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid this is going to be the most intense Seven Mountains Meeting ever," said Goran with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>The old man who had once distributed flags in Dragon City said, "Goran, who do you think will reign victorious this time?"</p>

  <p>"It should be Feng Ge," Athemar cut in confidently.</p>

  <p>"Really? Athemar, have you lost your faith in Zheng?" Winchell asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>After all, Athemar had personally led Zheng to the Flow Sword Sect. In order to keep Zheng in the Oneness Mountain, he had even had a dispute with Winchell.</p>

  <p>Athemar smiled helplessly. "Zheng's advantage is speed and agility, but he can't afford to collide with Feng Ge's stone. He has no other way to deal with the situation except to dodge..."</p>

  <p>"Hey, Athemar, don't forget our Origin Mountain is also in the game," said Winchell with a wink.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge and Zheng chased after each other, the Origin Mountain grabbed this opportunity to stealthily make their way to the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had just helped them, Jermain still had his eyes on the prize-- even if it meant leaving Zheng to deal with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Jermain, is it wrong to do this?" Dorothy asked hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a game, after all. The enemy of an enemy is a friend, but right now, they are both our enemies," said Jermain with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy was about to refute when a gust of wind suddenly pushed her.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The giant stone of Origin Mountain was smashed off its trail, flinging three people off it.</p>

  <p>Jermain whipped his head around to see what happened, and his expression fell. "Whitlock?"</p>

  <p>Whitlock, from the Ivory Mountain, grinned at him from above. Their boulder had violently crashed into that of the Origin Mountain. He had been hoping to garner third or second place, But now that there was a glimmer of hope for him to get first place, he immediately grabbed this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Ivory Mountain, which had been lurking in the shadows for most of the game, finally took action.</p>

  <p>"If you have a chance to win the first place and still don't fight for it, doesn't that make you a fool?" Whitlock laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>Because the Ivory Mountain was not as strong as the Origin Mountain, they kept a low profile all the time. Thanks to this strategy, there were eighteen disciples on their boulder, while only nine on Origin Mountain's.</p>
