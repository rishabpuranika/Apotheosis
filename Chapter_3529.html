<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spirits City was a place with a long, colorful history. After all, it had existed longer than the present round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Both Flamine and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had travelled across the Desire World and passed by the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>They were rather weak during that time. They faced much more powerful beings from the Other Shore and had to swallow all the insults and live in silence, just like other feeble creatures.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they had never thought that Zheng and Feng Ge would've occupied the Myriad Spirits City as soon as they entered the Desire World.</p>

  <p>"Those two youngsters are more ambitious than I was," Eastern Emperor Taiyi mused with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Flamine blinked a few times before she anxiously said, "The Element Spirit race is currently the dominant race on the Other Shore, while many races from the Source World such as the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race control the different stages of the Other Shore, respectively. Since Feng Ge and Zheng did such big acts, I'm afraid those races would take revenge on them."</p>

  <p>"Hmph! Even if they didn't commit such acts, they still might be attacked,"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi said coldly. "I'm only afraid that the ruler of Stage Fourteenth of the Other Shore would do something against Feng Ge. I'm not afraid of anything else."</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, Feng Ge's successful rise into the Desire World was great news for the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>After all, a purified being who could grow was terrifying.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race and the Sun Crow race would definitely regard her as a thorn in their flesh. With her strength as a purified being, however, she had no reason to be afraid of ordinary creatures on the Other Shore, or even powerful creatures in the Dark Region. She could easily melt all of them with her Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>Yet, there was a ruler in charge of the Dark Region in each stage, starting from Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. It would be rather troublesome if Feng Ge confronted such a ruler.</p>

  <p>"So, I'll send a message to the two young ones and tell them to be careful," said Flamine with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Eastern Emperor Taiyi agreed as his eyes glimmered with deep light. "Now, it's almost time to have a showdown. I hope that they can both grow up quickly and rise to a higher stage. In that case, maybe they can help the Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>A smile graced Flamine's face. "They will definitely be able to help the Oneness Sky Palace. As of now, Feng Ge has reached the suitable age for marriage. Your Majesty, will you arrange a marriage for her?" she said.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Feng Ge had become a purified being because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he was in no way inferior to Feng Ge's potential on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi still hadn't figured out how Zheng had sent his corporeal body to the Other Shore, until now.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had secretly observed Zheng. He had faintly sensed the unique Truth of Godly Way from Zheng's body, but he had never felt such an aura of the Truth of Godly Way from anybody else. Thus, he couldn't find any clue at all.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I told you? Everybody has his or her destined mate. Now that Zheng already has wives and a child, how can he satisfy Feng Ge?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked back.</p>

  <p>"I had a long talk with Feng Ge after she got back from the Chaotic Source World. I'm sure she's satisfied with Zheng. As her mother, of course I have to help her on the matter.</p>

  <p>We don't need to attach so much importance to her status, but..." "But what?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that the old lady's granddaughter also likes Zheng. I'm afraid..."</p>

  <p>Flamine calmly explained, her lips curving into a slight frown.</p>

  <p>Yasamin was a powerful figure who was second only to Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Oneness Sky Palace. She, however, had a strange temper. Only a few people from the other mountains liked her. Moreover, they had a conflict last time when they were in the Vastness Mountain. That instance made Flamine dislike Yasamin even more.</p>

  <p>"You mean Dorothy?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi questioned. There was an instance when Yasamin had mentioned some of Dorothy's secrets to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>She had painstakingly cultivated and raised Dorothy for many years, who was considered as the apple of her eye.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi always had a headache at the thought of the stubborn Yasamin.</p>

  <p>"I'll find a chance to sound out Yasamin's opinion," said Eastern Emperor Taiyi with a wry smile. He had never thought that his outstanding daughter would have to compete with another girl for a husband.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Land of Sword Grief had been peaceful for a few days. All the disciples struggled to contain their uncontrollable excitement.</p>

  <p>"Our Oneness Sky Palace can finally hold our heads high on the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"Occupying a large city is really something I had never dared to think of!"</p>

  <p>"You guys on the second floor! Do you want to come down and have a look? Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The last comment didn't actually mean to go down from the second floor to the first floor, but rather from the higher stages of the Other Shore to Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Although many disciples on the first floor had nothing to do with occupying the Myriad Spirits City, they still felt honored.</p>

  <p>Many of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace scurried back from Stage Fifteen, Stage Sixteen, and even Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. They all wanted to witness the grand occasion in the Myriad Spirits City. At the same time, Zheng was so generous that he intended to distribute a part of what he had gained among the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace Previously, Zheng knew that he could get more resources and support from the Oneness Sky Palace after he entered the Land of Sword Grief. And, he understood that many disciples had contributed to those resources.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't like what Abdul had said, he still thought that he had to give something in return after he had stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace for a long time.</p>

  <p>Once he had finished his tasks, he moved his soul to the Myriad Spirits City. Then, he went on a short-term seclusion after he had exited the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even though he had shown his mighty strength in the Myriad Spirits City, he clearly knew that the Other Shore was definitely not as simple as it looked.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Light Region might not compare to him and Feng Ge, but what about those in the Dark Region? Besides, there might be another purified being in the Dark Region in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the purpose of his cultivation in seclusion this time was to refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed he had acquired from the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>In the secluded cultivation room, Zheng held in his palm the seed that emitted blue light.</p>

  <p>"If I refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, will Chiyou's bloodline disappear completely?" he asked No. 9527 with a bit of hesitation. He simply wanted to obtain more blood of the Chaos Ancient God in order to become stronger, but he was still a member of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If he eliminated all traces of his original bloodline, then he would no longer have any blood connection with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Hey, there's nothing to worry about! The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed will not change your bloodline. It can only copy blood. When you have copied enough blood of my master, the sclerite on your chest will continue to grow. You can store the extra blood in the sclerite," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>"The sclerite..."</p>

  <p>When Zheng had merged with the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline for the first time, a sclerite started to grow on his chest. No. 9527 had previously hid inside the sclerite, and the Truth Crystal had come out from it as well.</p>

  <p>Since then, he had never had the chance to procure any more blood of the Chaos Ancient God, so the sclerite didn't grow.</p>

  <p>Now that it was unnecessary for him to worry about his original bloodline, he didn't hesitate anymore.</p>

  <p>He gently tossed the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed and made it float in front of his chest. He then put his palms over his chest, which activated the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline. Green light gathered around his hands, and a Truth Crystal gradually took shape.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult for him to refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. The Snake Goddess had simply given him some instructions, which he had always kept in mind.</p>
