  <p>
</p>

  <p>At last, Bentley's words quickly broke the tense atmosphere that blanketed the whole main hall.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng also sighed in relief, but he still firmly said, "If you still want to test me, I will leave the Heavenly Han House. Everyone wants to go to the Floating Island, but this won't be my only chance."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's words, Malloy felt slightly moved.</p>

  <p>There were many highly talented proving godly warriors in the Heavenly Han House, but most of them were wildly arrogant. However, none of them was actually sure that they would enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Malloy saw absolute confidence in Luo Zheng's face, and he believed that Luo Luo Zheng was capable of doing so.</p>

  <p>Even if the Heavenly Han House didn't help Luo Luo Zheng, it wouldn't be too hard for him to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Young man, it seems that you're still angry," Bentley said to Luo Luo Zheng with a chuckle. "You almost broke my old bones, but I won't seek revenge for that?"</p>

  <p>"According to Master Malloy, you don't accept people with unknown origins," Luo Luo Zheng abruptly said in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>Bentley blinked, and then turned to stare at Malloy.</p>

  <p>The real reason why they invited Bentley over was to discuss the said matter. However, Bentley attacked Luo Luo Zheng once he had arrived. Apparently, he had discovered Luo Zheng's inexplicable power and was greatly interested in the younger man's true strength.</p>

  <p>"Who said you came from the unknown? Your name is Tianxing Luo, right?</p>

  <p>You were born in Misty Mountain Village, a suburb of Mirror City in the Vast Sky Region. You are highly talented, have infinite power and have devoured strange objects since a young age. And, you have learned from powerhouses..." The longer Bentley spoke, the wilder the tales that he fabricated. He even made up some stories about Luo Zheng's childhood. It sounded true at first, but after careful consideration, it didn't.</p>

  <p>However, Malloy looked quite happy. He guessed that Bentley was in favor of him. Bentley was still responsible for checking Tianxing's origins.</p>

  <p>Since the Han Clan had been on the Floating Island for a long time, it was impossible for them to thoroughly investigate many things, so they believed whatever Bentley said without any doubts. In their case, as long as he could forge a fake identity for Tianxing, everything would go smoothly.</p>

  <p>"What if, I mean, what if..." On the other hand, Luke appeared quite wary as he said, "It's not that I don't trust Tianxing, but if he is plotting something, then what should we do when his plot is exposed?"</p>

  <p>Bentley glared angrily at Luke. "Don't worry because you won't shoulder this responsibility. If that were to happen, the Han Clan might be angry at me and dismiss me from my post. Then, you'd have a chance to succeed me as leader," he said with a trace of displeasure.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," Luke responded awkwardly. After that, Bentley simply ignored Luke and Declan.</p>

  <p>He looked rather unhappy a moment ago, but now his face was full of excitement. He turned to Luo Luo Zheng and smiled. "Are you satisfied now? Look how sincere I am. Can you teach me the secret to train strength?" he finally asked.</p>

  <p>Only Bentley knew how truly terrifying Luo Zheng's strength was. The others had only seen several smashed walls, but they didn't know that Bentley had used up all his strength just to stabilize his body. Otherwise, it wouldn't just be smashed walls. His body might've been seriously damaged.</p>

  <p>It was true that it was unrealistic for a proving godly warrior to have such terrible power. It was simply beyond the scope of common understanding. Although the proving godly warriors trained by the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were highly powerful as well, Bentley knew that they were nowhere on Luo Zheng's level.</p>

  <p>Even Pascal, who was currently considered to be the strongest, had been very fortunate in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and cultivated an immense amount of power, was still much weaker than the current Tianxing when he was a world lord.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I can't," Luo Luo Zheng answered stiffly, although he knew Bentley was joking.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you the secret code of my clan as an exchange," Bentley urged even more. When Malloy heard Bentley speak about something so outrageous, he cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Since Master Bentley has agreed to let Tianxing stay, should we wait until next year for the Han Clan to come, or recommend him to the Floating Island right now?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Next year?" Bentley hissed. "If we wait until next year, we won't stand a chance," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Malloy asked in surprise. Truly, he didn't quite understand what Bentley meant.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, the sixth sub-branch already sent someone to the Time Sea,"</p>

  <p>Bentley said coldly. "The sixth sub-branch..." Malloy muttered.</p>

  <p>His brows furrowed in confusion. If it was true, then? The thing he was most worried about came true.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan's twenty seven sub-branches weren't unitary. Now, a part of the powerhouses on the Floating Island came from some sub-branches, and those sub-branches were more closely related to the powerhouses of the Han Clan. Joy, a Demi-holy Being, was from the sixth sub-branch.</p>

  <p>Many people had witnessed the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way acknowledge Luo Luo Zheng on that very day. Ever since then, Malloy had been a bit worried.</p>

  <p>It was known that Joy and all the sub-branches agreed that she would take anyone who could cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way as her disciple. The Heavenly Han House had always complied with this agreement, and gave Joy all the girls who possessed the Purple Power Bodies and those acknowledged by the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng did not possess the Purple Power Body. Although the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way had indeed acknowledged him, there must be some other reason behind it.</p>

  <p>Joy was the Han Clan's Demi-holy Being, only second to the Holy Emperor. Moreover, it was said that she had always been domineering in her clan and even the Holy Emperor had to give in to her. If she knew about Luo Zheng's case and wanted to take him away by force, the Heavenly Han House wouldn't be able to resist her.</p>

  <p>What Malloy hadn't expected was that the sixth sub-branch had acted so quickly. It had only been a few days, yet they had already sent someone to the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"What should we do then?" Malloy asked anxiously. A small laugh escaped Bentley's lips.</p>

  <p>"I acted faster. The second day after the test, I had ordered someone to go. I believe we can get ahead of the sixth sub-branch and have enough time to send Tianxing to the Floating Island. If Joy wants to recruit Luo Luo Zheng, she will have to ask the Han Clan," he said.</p>

  <p>"An excellent move! Master Bentley, you're truly something!" Malloy exclaimed. He couldn't help but sigh. Bentley's methods were always unpredictable, but it was true that he could anticipate possible future scenarios and was able to act accordingly and reasonably.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he wasn't interested in the things that they discussed.</p>

  <p>Whoever helped him enter the Floating Island wasn't important, as he thought it would be best if Malloy forged an identity for him. If the Han Clan didn't suspect anything, then the other great clans on the Floating Islands wouldn't have any doubts.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had left the main hall, he didn't return to his own residence.</p>

  <p>Instead, he headed towards the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>Bentley had already informed the Han Clan on the Floating Island, so Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't have much time to stay in Six-Burden Divine City. He had to hurry and investigate where the mud came from. He didn't expect the Heavenly Han House to help him condense the Godly Tile and become a True God. Thus, that piece of mud from the Tie Clan was the key to condensing the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>In the Money Alley, Linn sat and took care of her clan's stall. She looked as bored as ever as her eyes blankly stared into the distance.</p>

  <p>She didn't participate in the test of the Heavenly Han House this time. It wasn't that her clan wasn't able to get a slot--she could even get many slots easily with her way of management.</p>

  <p>However, her innate talent for cultivation was quite mediocre. If she relied on her own strength to condense the Godly Tile, it might take too long for her to progress. Therefore, she might have to implant an ownerless Godly Tile someday.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Luo Zheng appeared in front of Linn. Her eyes immediately glowed with a strange light. Anyone who knew her would know that she would only look that way when she saw divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Clearly, Luo Luo Zheng was like a heap of divine might coins in her eyes.</p>
