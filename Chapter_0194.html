  <p>
</p>

  <p>The five-clawed blackish purple dragon was savagely ripped into pieces by another five-clawed golden dragon. Then the demonic life energy that came out from the body of the dead dragon penetrated into the golden dragon.</p>

  <p>The golden dragon became darker, and in a blink of an eye, it became a black dragon with its body bigger than before. It became more powerful and ruthless, more stunning than ever.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled, "You may have suffered a loss but don't let it define you?"</p>

  <p>The general of the imperial army witnessed everything and was amazed by the golden dragon's transformation. He jabbered, "How? How...</p>

  <p>How did it happen?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of Cloud Sect that watched the battle were all speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was triumphant that dark purple life energy was whirling wildly around him like a strong electrical bolt.</p>

  <p>And the victorious dragon swirled in the sky and then dashed to the general of the imperial army.</p>

  <p>The general's face turned pale as he realized that this dragon was too powerful. Under the critical situation, he couldn't think of an appropriate way to save himself in such a short time and all of a sudden, another golden dragon appeared above his hand.</p>

  <p>The disciples of Cloud Sect saw what happened.</p>

  <p>"The general of the imperial army is a powerful man of Illuminating Soul Realm, but foolish. Is he courting death?"</p>

  <p>"It's a shame that he is part of Illuminating Soul Realm. It's unbelievable? He is too foolish!"</p>

  <p>The assessment of the disciples was right, as another five-clawed golden dragon was swallowed by the enormous black dragon of Luo Luo Zheng and its size had tripled.</p>

  <p>The five-clawed golden dragon was so huge that it could wind around a palace instantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's dragon was now three times bigger than its original size. The giant animal glistened and swirled in the sky, and once it would go down, it could destroy the whole world.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng motioned to his giant dragon and waved his hand to it. The giant five-clawed dragon obeyed its master and dashed like a speeding bullet to the general. The dragon roared and howled at him.</p>

  <p>The general was rigid with fear and regretted everything.</p>

  <p>He defended Josef!</p>

  <p>There were countless capable men in White Emperor City. Why did he ever choose Josef? He never thought he could lose his precious life because of this mistake.</p>

  <p>But he did no wrong! That bloke was only half-step into the nature level, and he was a powerful man of Illuminating Soul Realm. Couldn't he fight with a small man who was just weaker? The general was lost in his hopeless thoughts. He was scared and deeply frustrated at the same time.</p>

  <p>When the giant dragon went down to him and tried to get closer, a barrier appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>The barrier was a square box, enwrapping and protecting the general of the imperial army.</p>

  <p>The barrier was so indestructible that? no matter how the giant dragon thumped and pounded heavily, it wouldn't destroy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng witnessed everything from afar. He heaved a sigh, and it seemed that some powerful being was intervening.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Luo Luo Zheng that as he had created such a chaos in White Emperor City, he would definitely attract some powerful men.</p>

  <p>He manipulated the giant dragon with all his might, but breaking the barrier was next to impossible. At long last, the demonic life energy that had engulfed the giant dragon was used up, and in a fleeting moment, it disappeared into the vast sky.</p>

  <p>Just then, a young girl wearing a long and colorful dress with its hem dancing gracefully appeared from the sky.</p>

  <p>The young girl waved her slender hand from the sky and the barrier that protected the general disappeared.</p>

  <p>The barrier was from the young girl.</p>

  <p>"Ah, is she..." The disciples of Cloud Sect cried in surprise.</p>

  <p>"She is Yolande!" One disciple had spoken her lovely name.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God. It's my first time to see her. She is so beautiful yet aloof."</p>

  <p>"She is called the Killer Girl."</p>

  <p>All the disciples of Cloud Sect made a buzzing sound and whispered to each other. They were mesmerized by this young girl in the sky and thought they knew her so well as they talked about her with great familiarity.</p>

  <p>Stairs appeared from the sky, and the young girl slowly walked down.</p>

  <p>Only a person of Illuminating Soul Realm could fly in the sky, but the young girl was unique. At her every step, a transparent stair would appear under her feet. She walked down gracefully with the long colorful dress flying. The wooden shoes she wore on her snow-white feet clattered and echoed in the sky as she walked down.</p>

  <p>She walked slowly, but in just one blink, she appeared next to Luo Luo Zheng and faced him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the young girl and studied her from head to foot.</p>

  <p>Yolande looked like a blossoming girl coming out of age, and her face was round and chubby like a baby. Her eyes were grey as if a winter frost had covered them, they were lifeless as compared to Nina's or Aura's.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find any life in her eyes. There was no sorrow or joy, not even a reflection.</p>

  <p>If she didn't have any feeling at all, wasn't she a puppet?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought all of these but didn't dare speak his mind. He was a little nervous when facing Yolande.</p>

  <p>She saved the general of the imperial army and her mighty power overwhelmed Luo Luo Zheng. He stood still and didn't move for her to realize he wasn't her enemy.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" Yolande opened her mouth to ask.</p>

  <p>She had the sweetest voice, like that of a nightingale. No woman's voice even that of Nina, Mu Ning, or Coco, the singing girl in the Golden Wind Restaurant could surmount it.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't like her voice!</p>

  <p>Her voice might be sweet, and mesmerizing but it sounded chilly. There were no emotions?</p>

  <p>"My name is  Luo Luo Zheng," Luo Luo Zheng answered the girl.</p>

  <p>Yolande answered, "Oh" and continued, "You are strange. You are still half-step into the nature level yet you defeated Hugh."</p>

  <p>When he saw Yolande's face as she spoke, Luo Luo Zheng thought it was laughable.</p>

  <p>She said he was strange but he couldn't get any emotion from her at all.</p>

  <p>She was equally strange as he was.</p>

  <p>"Today, you used your unique life energy and transformed Hugh's five-clawed golden dragon. But I didn't find your moves challenging at all."</p>

  <p>From a distance, she then glanced at the general called Hugh and added,</p>

  <p>"You still couldn't control the dragon even with your mighty strength for long and all Hugh needed to do was just wait for your life energy to be used up."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found the girl to be wise and shrewd. But why she looked so emotionless?</p>

  <p>"But that's not important. You are in White Emperor City, and you offended our imperial army. It is a penalty of death. You may choose how you want to die, I will be the one to take your life." Yolande announced expressionless.</p>

  <p>This girl...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was speechless. She said she would take his life like it were easy as killing chickens.</p>

  <p>She was so senseless and heartless that Luo Luo Zheng felt hopeless.</p>

  <p>"There should be a fair judgment. And I only fought back." Luo Luo Zheng felt miserable and showed a long face again.</p>

  <p>The people in White Emperor City were all unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"There is no judgment. I only have the law. White Emperor City is founded by the imperial army. Any action that offends the imperial army is a kiss of death." Yolande said nonchalantly as she turned a deaf ear to his protest.</p>

  <p>"What if I don't want to die?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in reply.</p>

  <p>"It's not for you to decide." After saying that, Yolande stretched her long elegant hand, and a translucent box appeared above Luo Zheng's head. It tried to cover him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew he couldn't defeat her, but wouldn't accept his doomed fate. He rolled on the ground to feet away, and the box failed to cover its target.</p>

  <p>Yolande, still not showing any expression from her face, walked slowly to Luo Luo Zheng with her clattering wooden shoes. She gracefully waved her hand, and countless boxes appeared in the sky, rushing to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng skilfully avoided them one by one without a stop, but there were too many boxes. At last, he was forced to the ground, and a box covered him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng touched the box, bit his teeth and punched it.</p>

  <p>It was so indestructible no matter how hard he smashed.</p>

  <p>When he was fighting with Josef, he shot him with a Nine-foot Spectroscope, and he couldn't break into the light, but it eventually swayed after he hit it with his strong fist.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't destroy the translucent box that he was imprisoned into.</p>

  <p>It remained firm from his violent punch.</p>

  <p>"I'll destroy you."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, more than a hundred dragon scales lit up and glistened in Luo Zheng's mind. With the ferocious strength, he summoned all his power and punched the box, yet it remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Demonic life energy. Devour!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng released the demonic life energy and tried to swallow the box, but the demonic life energy which was powerful had lost for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Broken flying knife!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took out the broken flying knife from the space ring. The sharp flying blade which could cut everything on its way couldn't even break into the box.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yolande's long colorful dress floated gently as she walked with her clattering shoes. She came to Luo Luo Zheng, "It's no use. You couldn't defeat my enchanted barrier."</p>

  <p>"Enchanted barrier? Is this an enchantment?" Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his brow and was caught in deep thought.</p>

  <p>"Since you didn't choose a way to die, I will make that choice for you."</p>

  <p>Yolande stretched out her snow-white hand and waved her slender fingers lightly. Within seconds, a sharp-edged, thin and glowing enchanted barrier appeared on her hand.</p>

  <p>Its glow was blinding and she put the enchantment inside the box.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was standing still and breathing heavily. If the enchantment was pushed in, it would cut through his neck?</p>
