  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned upon hearing those words. It was the voice of Fredric, the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of the threat Frederic posed. After all, among the divine-level geniuses that were there, not one had the strength to threaten him. Even Fredric was not qualified to do that.</p>

  <p>Zheng's strength was not on the same level as these divine-level talents— his was greater. This was a fact that many divine-level talents and princes were unwilling to admit.</p>

  <p>Since Fredric had dared to threaten him the way he did, then this mineral-devouring bug might not just be a simple bug. There must be a secret hidden within it.</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, Zheng's gaze landed on Fredric. "I'll be dead? But how will I die, Fredric? Care to elaborate?"</p>

  <p>Fredric also observed the mineral-devouring bug for a while. He really did not expect that Zheng would be able to catch it with his hands. 'It's the green kind!' he thought to himself, breathing shallowly because of his anger. After a few moments of silence, Fredric smiled back at Zheng. He then replied, "This kind of mineral-devouring bug is captured by the Soul Sea Realm masters every year! When did it become your turn to capture it? You're unqualified to do that!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze immediately shifted to Randy. Randy nodded and told Zheng,</p>

  <p>"The mineral-devouring bug's number is small. There are only about thirty to forty of them appearing each year. Even the Life and Death Realm masters have difficulty capturing those bugs, and usually, it would only be the Soul Sea Realm masters from the four great divine kingdoms who would be able to catch them."</p>

  <p>"Is this bug very important?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In his mind, the mineral-devouring bug was peculiar. As its name suggested, devouring ores was its main thing, but aside from that, it was also incomparably agile. Its reaction to the things happening around it was blazing fast. Zheng traveled through space as he was trying to catch it, and even with almost no time to react, the bug was still able to avoid him.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't believe that these bugs were worth the Soul Sea Realm masters' troubles. That made him curious. Yes, the ores in these bugs' stomachs might be valuable, but that still wasn't enough to attract the Soul Sea Realm masters' attention, practically making them obsessed with it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Randy replied with an understanding smile on his lips. "These mineral-devouring bugs have a special ability. They can cut any leaf on the giant tree!"</p>

  <p>"What? So what if it can do that?" Zheng asked, now more confused than ever.</p>

  <p>Randy knew that Zheng would ask this question, and so he continued to explain, "Only the Life and Death Realm warriors would be able to enter the 30th layer and those above it. The reason is that they might encounter mineral-devouring bugs— those creatures pose an incredible threat to the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors. Because of that, the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors who aren't that powerful are not allowed to enter those layers.</p>

  <p>As for the 40th layer and the above, only Soul Sea Realm masters could enter them mainly because in those layers, there is a high chance of encountering purple mineral-devouring bugs. Those are the matured versions of green mineral-devouring bugs, and they are incredibly strong.</p>

  <p>Now, from the 45th layer to the 47th layer— the top layers— some extremely valuable ores could be found. One of the most important of them is called the 'Soul Core', and it is very important to the four great divine kingdoms. One might even consider it as the most important thing in the four divine kingdoms! However, no one can obtain that as not even a Soul Sea Realm master can slash through the leaves of those three layers."</p>

  <p>"Even a Soul Sea Realm master can't reach and dig the leaves of the top layers?" Zheng repeated, visibly surprised. As he learned that new information, his eyes began to narrow.</p>

  <p>It was known that Zheng, in particular, had witnessed the immense strength of a Soul Sea Realm master several times. The most recent one was when he was attacked by War Emperor York. The force of his punch alone was able to destroy everything in its path, and that included a mountain range!</p>

  <p>If someone like War Emperor York wouldn't be able to slash through the leaves of the top layers of this tree, no one would be able to.</p>

  <p>This was not a secret to the four divine kingdoms, however. The divine-level talents who were present looked calm and didn't show any kind of surprise. Callan and Fiona, however, were both astonished. They hadn't explored the Feather Holy Sea before, and although they knew about the four secret lands, they didn't know much about the actual situation in them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the mineral-devouring bug, my friend, which is under your feet, can easily slash through those. That is why this creature is so important to the people here," Randy further explained, smiling. He then added, "As for Soul Cores, since this kind of green mineral-devouring bug usually stays on the 30th floor, it is less likely that it has a Soul Core inside it. But every time the Feather Emperor Secret Land is opened, both green and purple mineral-devouring bugs would be killed." As Randy's eyes bored into Zheng's, he asked him, "Now, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He now fully understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters could not slash through the leaves on the top layers, but they were in sore need of the Soul Cores. Thus they could only place their hopes on these mineral-devouring bugs. Every year, they hunted these creatures in order to obtain those precious cores. On one hand, they wanted to drive the insects away from the tree, but on the other hand, they also wanted to get the Soul Cores from their bodies.</p>

  <p>"The emperors do not prohibit others from killing mineral-devouring bugs, right?" Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Randy shook his head and replied, "No."</p>

  <p>But that was only because an ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior wouldn't have the skill and strength to catch a mineral-devouring bug.</p>

  <p>Actually, even a divine-level talent who belonged on the first tier or even a warrior as powerful as Fiona or little monster had little chance of catching such a creature.</p>

  <p>Only the powerful Life and Death Realm warriors and some Soul Sea Realm masters had a fighting chance in catching mineral-devouring bugs.</p>

  <p>Because of that, those Life and Death Realm warriors and the Soul Sea Realm masters would usually hunt the bugs together. They didn't set a rule that would prevent other people from hunting the mineral-devouring bugs because no one else could, except for them.</p>

  <p>"Well, if there is no such prohibition, why can't I kill this bug?" Zheng asked, turning his gaze to Fredric. His eyes didn't have any kind of emotion in them— he was indifferent.</p>

  <p>Being under Zheng's mysteriously intense gaze, Fredric couldn't help but feel a shudder run up his spine. If this guy didn't feel a single drop of fear towards Fredric's father, how could he be afraid of Fredric, the mere crown prince of a divine kingdom?</p>

  <p>Glaring back at Zheng, he shrieked, "Humph! Even if you obtain a Soul Core from this mineral-devouring bug, I'm afraid you won't have the guts to take it yourself!"</p>

  <p>In response to Fredric's obviously hollow threat, Zheng only faintly smiled.</p>

  <p>With a light tap of his finger, a long sword shot out from his space ring.</p>

  <p>With the long sword in his hand, he cut the abdomen of the mineral-devouring bug beneath his foot. The only thing in his mind right now was obtaining the life stones inside the creature's body.</p>

  <p>The defensive power of the mineral-devouring bug's scales was extremely astonishing. Under Zheng's sword strike, only a row of scales were shattered. After the second sword strike, however, Zheng was finally able to break into its stomach.</p>

  <p>Clink! Clank!</p>

  <p>The amount of food inside the bug was shockingly huge as well. After Zheng was able to cut through to its stomach, all sorts of ores flowed out of it in an instant. People estimated that three hundred ores came out of the creature!</p>

  <p>The hundreds of divine-level talents were all staring wide-eyed at the bug's abdomen where ores were continuously flowing out. Although there were indeed numerous ores, which were all extremely precious, coming out of it, at that moment, what they were highly anticipating for was whether or not Zheng would be able to find a Soul Core inside the bug.</p>

  <p>They were all highly skeptical about it, however. First of all, green mineral-devouring bugs rarely stayed at the top of the trees, and second, if there was a small chance of finding a Soul Core inside a purple mineral-devouring bug's body, there was even a lower chance that a green mineral-devouring bug would have it inside it.</p>

  <p>Another key point in all of these was that a year might have passed since the mineral devouring bug devoured a Soul Core from a leaf on the top layers, and it would have already fully digested it...</p>

  <p>So, if a short while before the Feather Emperor Secret Land opened, a green or purple mineral-devouring bug flew up to the 45th layer or higher layers, dug out a Soul Core, swallowed it but still hadn't digested it when a Soul Sea Realm master captured it, then the Soul Core would still be there and the Soul Sea Realm master would have the honor of obtaining it for his or her divine kingdom!</p>

  <p>However, in the span of a few years, it had already become too difficult even for the most powerful warriors to obtain a single Soul Core despite slaughtering several hundred mineral-devouring bugs.</p>

  <p>As the ores in the bug's stomach slowly flowed out of it along with its bodily fluids, Randy's eyes started to show a hint of disappointment.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng only smiled as he continued watching what was happening. Seriously, he asked, "What's wrong, Lord Randy? No Soul Core?"</p>

  <p>Randy nodded and replied, "No Soul Core!"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care about that too much. First, it still wasn't clear to him what the function of the Soul Core truly was, and second, he was currently focused on finding life stones. A Soul Core was not a life stone, so he couldn't care any less about it.</p>

  <p>Although this mineral-devouring bug apparently didn't have a Soul Core in its stomach, the sheer amount of life stones it had made Zheng incredibly satisfied.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he turned to Camilla, who was beside him, and smiled. "Could you please help me sell these items?" he said pleadingly.</p>

  <p>Camilla's eyes widened, and as a response, she pouted and said, "What the hell? No! They're so dirty and disgusting!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng would not let a woman do such a dirty job. Chuckling, he personally took out the ores one by one from the mineral-devouring bug's body fluids.</p>
