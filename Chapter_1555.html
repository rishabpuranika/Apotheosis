  <p>
</p>

  <p>Facing Lucille's five-colored palm print, Zheng's face was filled with happiness.</p>

  <p>In that instant, Zheng activated the power of 30, 000 dragon scales.</p>

  <p>He also sent a palm strike toward Lucille. However, within this ordinary palm strike was an unimaginable power.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was out of helplessness that Lucille had used the Five-element Palm Print against Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was just like what the bystanders had said: Lucille was not in her complete form right now.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, in another supreme world of the Illusion Battlefield, there was another Lucille— Lucy.</p>

  <p>One Soul in Two Bodies...</p>

  <p>Although such cultivation methods were rare in the universe, they did exist.</p>

  <p>It was similar to Yolande's cultivation method, with which she could split her own soul into a million pieces.</p>

  <p>However, after she activated the Soul Split Spell, she could only gain enlightenment.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, with Lucille's One Soul in Two Bodies, although the two bodies shared one soul, they could cultivate separately. When the two of them merged, she would become complete as the true ace talent of the Ji Clan!</p>

  <p>Because of this, right now, Lucille could only use the Earth Element Power and the Metal Element Power. The other three Original Laws were very weak, so the powers of the five elements she released weren't complete.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>This palm print was the only choice Lucille had.</p>

  <p>If Lucy was here, it would be hard to say whether she would have won or lost against Zheng's palm strike. Since Lucy's combat style was completely different from hers, after the two of them merged, their strengths and weaknesses would complement each other, which would give her the perfect form of the five elements. That was the true cultivation of the five elements.</p>

  <p>But now, under Zheng's attack, Lucille's Five-element Palm Print started to crumble.</p>

  <p>"It's over," Zheng said with a smile. After breaking Lucille's attack, he placed his hand on Lucille's forehead. He had a gentle expression on his face, as if he was merely helping Lucille wipe the sweat on her forehead.</p>

  <p>However, with a light wave of his hand, a huge force spread out, causing Lucille's body to directly disintegrate in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>A red light wrapped around Lucille's soul and flew toward the main city.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Illusion Points burst out from her dissipated body.</p>

  <p>Countless Illusion Points began to spread out and grow, reaching 20 to 30 feet.</p>

  <p>The martial artists on the city walls were seeing so many Illusion Points that all of their eyes almost bulged out in surprise.</p>

  <p>Since Lucille had been the "lord" of the city, there were eight "butchers" that had helped her gather Illusion Points day and night. Under her absolute control, the number of Illusion Points she had collected was definitely not a small one.</p>

  <p>Although everyone had been mentally prepared to see a large number of Illusion Points, they were still surprised by the sight in front of them because it far exceeded their expectations.</p>

  <p>This was too much...</p>

  <p>Even Zheng was shocked when he saw these countless sparkling Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Illusion Points quickly flew toward Zheng and entered his body.</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points Zheng possessed soared at once. At the same time, his ranking in the pyramid was rising rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my..."</p>

  <p>Zheng realized that he now possessed around 4.6 million Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>After killing Norton, he had taken away hundreds of thousands of Illusion Points from him. Now, after killing Lucille, he had gained about 4 million Illusion Points. Since he had taken away half of her points, it meant that Lucille must have had more than eight million points in her body!</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points this woman had accumulated was far beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>After gaining all these Illusion Points, Zheng's rank had instantly skyrocketed to 309th in this supreme world and 14, 000th in the entire Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>Among a trillion strong warriors, the top 100, 000 were already dazzling existences!</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was only at the 14, 000th place, countless people around the universe were staring at his name in awe. At this moment, the name "Zheng Luo" once again became a topic of discussion.</p>

  <p>"Zheng... This is the Zheng who tells stories. He actually entered the top 100, 000!"</p>

  <p>"Look clearly. His rank is the 14, 000th! And he's ranked the 309th of the supreme world he is in! This guy is very strong. If he continues to rush upward, I'm afraid he'll be able to match those ace talents!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, what's so special about that? His fairy palace is the most valuable treasure out of all the treasures. If I could obtain such a fairy palace, I would definitely be the strongest!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, first of all, you'd have to really possess such a fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Then, you'd have to cultivate and reach the Soul Sea Realm before you…"</p>

  <p>There were heated discussions in every corner of the universe, and all of them were about Zheng. The universe's attention on Zheng had reached an unprecedented level.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had already made it to the top part of the rankings, everyone was wondering how far he could possibly go. Was he merely a flash in the pan, or was he going to rush straight all the way to the top?</p>

  <p>While these discussions were going on in the rest of the universe, the atmosphere in the Mist Palace was extremely lively.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was from the Mist Palace, their expectations for him had been extremely high.</p>

  <p>Of course, since Zheng hadn't previously made any achievement, a lot of people had been worried about him.</p>

  <p>Although Yolande's expression was calm, she was a little dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>She knew in her heart that Zheng would definitely soar to the top, but she didn't like how calm he was being. She was worried that he would stay in the Illusion Battlefield for a long time without getting anything.</p>

  <p>Now, when she heard Zheng's sudden rise in ranking, her lips finally curled up into a smile. "You're only at the 14, 000th rank... I wonder when you will charge into the top 1000 rankings," she murmured to herself. Her confidence in Zheng was the same as always.</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was in an uproar, but the atmosphere in another place was extremely solemn.</p>

  <p>Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>In the last few years, the patriarch of the Ji Clan had rarely shown up to meetings.</p>

  <p>Even though the Ji Clan was considered a family, in reality, the number of warriors with the surname "Ji" exceeded a million, which was equivalent to the population of a large country.</p>

  <p>And if the Ji Clan could be considered a country, then the patriarch was the supreme existence of that country.</p>

  <p>Since the patriarch himself had appeared, how could any of the important members of the Ji Clan be absent?</p>

  <p>This time, the Illusion Battlefield was extremely important to the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Lucille was the reason.</p>

  <p>Ji Clan had a total of three ace talents.</p>

  <p>However, the other two ace talents, Fraser Ji and Sylvia Ji, were no match for Lucille Ji.</p>

  <p>Although the strength of these two ace talents was by no means little, they were not on the same level as Lucille. Both Fraser and Sylvia could only barely fight against one of Lucille's two bodies, which only had half of Lucille's complete power.</p>

  <p>Thus, Lucille was the only hope of the Ji Clan. They all hoped that one day, Lucille would become the Godly Genius of the Ji Clan!</p>

  <p>This time, the opening of the Illusion Battlefield was a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Lucille's ranking was very eye-catching.</p>

  <p>She was already in the top ten of the pyramid!</p>

  <p>The cultivators ahead of her were all Godly Geniuses of the various great Clans. They were unique existences who exceeded the ace talents. These Godly Geniuses were strong enough to change the fate and direction of their clans!</p>

  <p>Any clan would be willing to spend all their resources on their Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>This was because there was a saying in the universe that went, "To destroy a powerful clan, one must first kill the Godly Genius of that clan!" If the Godly Genius wasn't killed, they would rely on their monstrous destiny and incredible talent to fight their way back one day.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when it came to great clans, even when their clans were destroyed, their Godly Geniuses could not be killed. The Godly Genius was only a seedling, but could become the future of the entire clan.</p>

  <p>There was something mystical about these words. After all, some of the great clans had a very solid foundation. If the Godly Genius of such a clan really did perish, then the clan would be able to foster a new one.</p>

  <p>However, from this saying, it could be seen just how much importance these clans placed on their Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>To be able to make it into the top ten of the entire Illusion Battlefield was already very impressive, but Lucille had an innate advantage in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>While everyone in the Illusion Battlefield was fighting alone, Lucille had two bodies, both of which were extremely strong. Naturally, her number of Illusion Points was twice that of the other ace talents, and even the number of some Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Ji Clan was not satisfied with Lucille's ranking.</p>

  <p>They wanted Lucille to be the first. There was no second choice, only first! After nurturing her for so many years, the Ji Clan would be ashamed if she didn't become the first.</p>

  <p>However, on the pyramid in front of the Ji Clan and the patriarch, Lucille's name suddenly fell down rapidly.</p>

  <p>From the 7th rank, she dropped directly down to the 700th!</p>
