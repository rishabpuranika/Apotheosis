<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The red ripples firmly locked Luo Luo Zheng within the girl's mind.</p>

  <p>He heard her chuckle. "You want to run? Your soul isn't even at the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm yet. You actually think you can escape from me?" she said.</p>

  <p>His heart sank at her words. It seemed she was so powerful that the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm was nothing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>That was the moment Luo Luo Zheng knew that he was in big trouble.</p>

  <p>He launched several attacks against the edges of the girl's mind but to no avail. His soul's power was limited and he did not dare exhaust it. He gave up in the meantime once he realized that he wasn't getting out of there that easily.</p>

  <p>He stopped resisting and settled on quietly floating in the darkness. He waited for a while before spreading his consciousness. "It's useless to keep me here. Why don't you let me out?" he tried convincing her.</p>

  <p>There was no response, and only silence pervaded the darkness. Luo Luo Zheng could not control the girl's body, so his soul was unable to sense anything from the outside. He was, to put it simply, trapped inside this pitch-black prison that was her mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to spread out his consciousness, trying to get her to talk.</p>

  <p>"Hey!</p>

  <p>Say something!</p>

  <p>Your body was bound in that crystal coffin for so many years, and I was the one who helped you break free from it!</p>

  <p>Your legs are still bound by the way. If you want to be truly free, you have to let me go so I can break the chains for you!"</p>

  <p>However, no matter what he did, there was still no response.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng berated himself for ever entering the girl's mind. The thought of never getting out of here made him extremely depressed. He should've just knocked her off the stone pillar and thrown her somewhere. It also frustrated him that he could've easily taken over any corpse back on the thirteenth floor, but he chose to enter this young girl's strange and mysterious body. He was in this predicament because of his greedy decision.</p>

  <p>The warriors back on the thirteenth floor were powerful, but they were only slightly stronger than the country leaders. They could never hope to compare to this girl at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Everyone also wanted to take over her body, not just him, but he was the one that succeeded. He was the one that had been able to open the crystal coffin and everyone else didn't want to compete against him. The only problem was that he was also the one trapped in this pitch-black prison with no hope of escaping.</p>

  <p>Just as he reflected on his actions, blood-red ripples suddenly appeared in the girl's mind and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Dodge!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul quickly mobilized the moment he saw them.</p>

  <p>His speed was enough to outrun the red ripples. However, the space in the girl's mind was limited and the ripples continued to spread.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the blood-red ripples covered her entire mind and surrounded Luo Luo Zheng. Since he was in his soul form, he was unable to use Space Law to dodge.</p>

  <p>A red hand quickly emerged from the ripples and grabbed Luo Zheng's soul by his ankle, pulling him towards the bottom.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The sensation of falling quickly overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>His soul seemed to be falling, piercing through the clouds as patches of incandescent electric lightning twisted around him.</p>

  <p>'Is this a fairyland or just a mere illusion?' he couldn't help but wonder to himself.</p>

  <p>As he fell, Luo Luo Zheng saw a vast ocean. As he got closer, he saw a single, solitary island in the middle, covered with living, emerald green foliage.</p>

  <p>Lightning continued to flash in the sky and he saw a bolt strike the island itself, setting a tree ablaze.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found himself being dragged into the center of the island, where he saw a group of people standing not too far away.</p>

  <p>Their clothes were made of leaves while their weapons consisted mostly of spears made of tree trunks. They looked primitive and not at all intelligent.</p>

  <p>However, another sight caught Luo Zheng's attention. In the middle of these spear-wielding people were four barbarians that carried a simple palanquin made of wooden sticks. Inside the sedan chair was a woman who had slender legs and golden eyes that glared at Luo Luo Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>It was none other than the girl in the stone pillar! To be exact, this was her soul!</p>

  <p>Her primitive attendants made all sorts of weird sounds as they carried her towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She gently raised her hand, signaling them to stop and put her down.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The young girl smiled at him, "A Lower World warrior is truly ignorant.</p>

  <p>You don't even know about this place!"</p>

  <p>His brow furrowed at her words. He actually had a wild guess what this place was, but he wasn't too sure.</p>

  <p>He knew for a fact that once a warrior entered the Life and Death Realm, the life vitality within his body would liquefy. Once it reached a certain level, he would enter the Soul Sea Realm and thus open up the Soul Sea within his body.</p>

  <p>It was said that this Soul Sea had the small possibility of sustaining life.</p>

  <p>However, this could only be done once the person had cultivated to a higher level.</p>

  <p>Only after reaching the Spirit Supreme Realm would the Soul Sea inside a warrior's body solidify and give birth to all sorts of creatures.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had dismissed it as hearsay, but the scene in front of him said otherwise.</p>

  <p>He returned the girl's cold glare. "It's just a world within the body of a warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm."</p>

  <p>The young girl's attitude changed quickly once she heard his conclusion.</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands with a smile. "Bingo!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring me here?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The girl blinked at him. "You were the one who wanted to possess my body shell and take over my? mmm... my body. Since you failed, you are now my captive. Do you understand now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could see that the young girl was on the verge of going insane and it gave him a very bad feeling.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how long she had been trapped inside the crystal coffin, but it was only normal for her to go mad after being locked up for so long.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng realized that he had no choice but to resort to threats. "Let me out.</p>

  <p>My companions are waiting for me outside. If I don't go out, they might destroy your body."</p>

  <p>Her face broke into a frown. "Your companions? You mean those little guys at the Soul Sea Realm?"</p>

  <p>'Little guys at the Soul Sea Realm...'</p>

  <p>Those 'little guys' were war emperors and war kings. To Luo Luo Zheng, they were old monsters that had lived for tens of thousands of years, but to this girl, they were nothing.</p>

  <p>His silence prompted the girl to continue speaking. "You think they can hurt me after you opened the crystal coffin with the Black Star? I'd like to see them try. If they even dare to?" She paused for a moment before letting out a borderline maniacal laugh. "There really is an idiot coming over!"</p>

  <p>The girl momentarily closed her eyes. When she opened them again, a golden light flashed within her pupils. "It was a little guy at the Soul Sea Realm. I've already killed him," she drawled lazily.</p>

  <p>"What?!" How could someone just kill a Soul Sea Realm warrior so quickly? How was that even possible?</p>

  <p>"You're lying," he said in a grave tone.</p>

  <p>The girl shot him a sharp look. "Lying? Why would I do that? I didn't want to kill him, but you threatened me. I needed to teach you a lesson.</p>

  <p>I've disintegrated both that guy's body and soul. Anyone who dares to steal Dragon Lineage Human's bodies is seeking death!"</p>
