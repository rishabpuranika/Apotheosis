  <p>Two legs and one arm were floating in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Cindy looked up at him with a faint smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, her smile seemed extremely cruel.</p>

  <p>"Alas! How will Cindy be able to get married in the future?"</p>

  <p>A relaxed atmosphere surrounded the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>The battle between Cindy and Luo Luo Zheng was almost over. She had shown her true colors in front of the entire universe. Now, after revealing how cruel she was, she wouldn't be able to find someone to marry her.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Luo Luo Zheng was very unlucky to have met our Cindy."</p>

  <p>"Well, I actually think he is lucky to have met her in the Illusion Battlefield. After all, he won't really die."</p>

  <p>"After all, he is still a warrior from the Lower World. Even if he has ascended to the Upper World, he is still unable to match any of those mighty warriors. A sparrow will never become a phoenix. How could he even think he could defeat the most fierce warrior of our Ji Clan?"</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan's warriors discussed the battle among themselves, each expressing their real feelings about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might not be as strong as Cindy, but his fame had spread across the universe. If she killed him, the Ji Clan would be known everywhere.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Janet's hand was caressing the flame kitten's vermilion fur as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>"This is bad!" she said while shaking her head.</p>

  <p>The warriors standing beside Janet were the young talents of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>They had been eliminated in the Illusion Battlefield. Most of them didn't pass through the first stage. Four of them had advanced to the second stage, three of which were eliminated right there.</p>

  <p>Since Janet had been able to enter the second stage, she was considered a top warrior among them.</p>

  <p>"Janet, what do you mean by that?" a girl asked.</p>

  <p>Janet's eyes glimmered as she said, "I'm afraid Cindy's going to lose."</p>

  <p>"What did you say? You must be joking!" the girl laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>And suddenly, as Janet finished speaking, the picture changed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly twisted his body in the air and stretched out his hand to grab his severed arm. His space ring was on the finger of the severed arm.</p>

  <p>All of this happened in a split-second.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only had one chance.</p>

  <p>The opponent he was facing was one of the strongest among the young generation of warriors in the universe.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was Nathan, Karl or Cindy, they were all well-trained. Their clans had invested incalculable resources to train the best warriors. They possessed the fate to lead the world of chaos and would play important roles in the upcoming crisis of the universe.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to defeat Cindy, he couldn't afford to make a single mistake.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took out his sword, flipped it over, and thrust it out.</p>

  <p>All these were done in one go with no effort.</p>

  <p>In the Emerald Dream, Cindy's speed and strength were incomparable.</p>

  <p>She seemed like she would never get tired or run out of energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had to find the right way to break this dream or she was invincible.</p>

  <p>Perhaps only a world lord or a Supreme Lord would be able to break this dream with pure strength.</p>

  <p>But even though she was extremely fast, her mind didn't keep up.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng attacked with all those steps in one go, Cindy didn't have the time to react.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword attack was extremely sudden, and without a reaction from Cindy, his sword slashed out.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The flying sword light was aimed directly at Cindy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of killing Cindy. She was probably an indestructible warrior in this dream, so killing her was a bad idea.</p>

  <p>The light from Luo Zheng's sword cut the peach blossom on her head.</p>

  <p>The sword light flashed, and from the center of the beautiful peach blossom atop her bun appeared a thin line.</p>

  <p>Although the edge of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword was sharp, it only left an undetectable mark on the petal.</p>

  <p>"What is Luo Luo Zheng doing?"</p>

  <p>"Such an excellent opportunity to end her! He only took the sword to cut the peach blossom on her head?!"</p>

  <p>"If it were me, I would have cut off her neck without a second thought!"</p>

  <p>The onlookers discussed Luo Zheng's sword strike among themselves. Everyone thought that Luo Luo Zheng had gone mad and should have killed Cindy.</p>

  <p>Nathan's eyes lit up at this scene.</p>

  <p>And Lucille was excited too. Even though she and Cindy were like sisters, she still secretly hoped that Luo Luo Zheng could continue to win in the competition until he met her.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had cut Cindy's peach blossom, she should have lost.</p>

  <p>The members of the Ji Clan saw what had happened and fell silent.</p>

  <p>As soon as Cindy activated the Emerald Dream, the warriors of Ji Clan knew that the peach blossom was the foundation of the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>Having destroyed the peach blossom, Luo Luo Zheng had also shattered the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even noticed the peach blossom before, and they were relieved to see that.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't destroy the peach blossom, he would never be able to wake up.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Cindy would win.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng unexpectedly cut the peach blossom with his sword.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Ji Clan was shocked, thinking that Luo Luo Zheng had been faking it all along, pretending he didn't know about the peach blossom.</p>

  <p>Cindy looked miserable.</p>

  <p>All the peach blossoms floating in the Emerald Dream began to shatter on their own, leaving pink traces behind as the petals disappeared from the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had been struggling with all her might.</p>

  <p>However, when the Emerald Dream disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng, who had lost both his legs and right arm, and Cindy both disappeared.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they appeared before everyone again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes and jumped up from the board.</p>

  <p>Cindy was curled up on the board hugging her legs. She raised her head to look at Luo Luo Zheng and gently bit her lips.</p>

  <p>It seemed that she would no longer resist.</p>

  <p>If she hadn't activated the dream, Cindy's strength would still be extraordinary. But she wasn't a match for Luo Luo Zheng, so her resistance would be futile.</p>

  <p>Tick tack.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng slowly walked towards her, a single teardrop fell from her left eye.</p>

  <p>Tick tack.</p>

  <p>Then more teardrops fell. Cindy couldn't stop it.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I hurt you." Cindy started to cry.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked up to her. Now, Cindy looked like a completely different person from the cruel-hearted woman in the dream. She seemed so delicate and weak that any man would want to protect her.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng remained cool. He didn't show the slightest mercy and said coldly, "Your dream was very beautiful, but once is enough. Are you trying to use your tears to activate another dream? Please stop it or I will have no choice but to end you right here right now."</p>

  <p>Cindy's body trembled at Luo Zheng's words. Only then did despair appear on her face as she said, "Fine! You win!" Her voice was so low that only Luo Luo Zheng could hear what she had said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled, turned around and walked towards his stone.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the battles on the Heaven Earth Board was to determine a victor. Luo Luo Zheng was not a bloodthirsty person, so he decided to let her go.</p>

  <p>He had only taken two steps when he suddenly turned around, lifted his sword and slashed it out towards Cindy.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A line of blood appeared on Cindy's forehead.</p>

  <p>In her hands, there was a small wooden doll.</p>

  <p>The wooden doll didn't seem like an ordinary item. Luo Luo Zheng wasn't sure what use the wooden doll had, but he couldn't take a chance with Cindy or he would be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Cindy fell to the board and was immediately eliminated from the battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng won the battle.</p>

  <p>Cindy slowly disappeared from the Heaven Earth Board with a raging face. No matter how unwilling she was, she was still sent out of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This woman is so evil!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning said angrily. Even though Luo Luo Zheng had won this battle, she was still angry at Cindy for torturing him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "You can't really blame her."</p>

  <p>"What? So now you actually care for that woman?" Mu Ning raised her thin eyebrows at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tianming agreed with Luo Luo Zheng by saying, "She cultivates the Dream Divine Dao and is unable to fight with you face to face. She can only use scheming techniques to draw you into her dream. This is also a way of fighting, and it has nothing to do with being evil or good."</p>

  <p>"You are right." Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the universe would display their strengths.</p>

  <p>A warrior would be faster than the other. Another warrior would be stronger. Every warrior had something that made them unique.</p>

  <p>The battles in the Illusion Battlefield continued. The next round was not a knock-out battle. The woman in pink chose Mu Ning and an ace talent from another race to fight.</p>

  <p>At this moment, high up in the sky, a streak of nine-colored light began to revolve slowly.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a skylark flew out from the light and flew towards the thick clouds. It flew towards the great hall in the middle of the clouds, and its pair of bird claws landed on the mysterious girl's pinky finger.</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl tilted her head slightly, listening to what the skylark was saying.</p>

  <p>Her eyes lit up. "You've already found out about Yan? She..."</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl looked astonished.</p>

  <p>She hadn't looked like this in hundreds of millions of years.</p>
