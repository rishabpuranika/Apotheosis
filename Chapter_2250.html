<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After summoning his momentum from his inner world, a bright white light suddenly burst forth around Hardy's right hand.</p>

  <p>This bright light slowly coalesced and formed itself into a milky white blade.</p>

  <p>"The Destruction Godly Way is practiced by very few people. My personality is not very suitable for it but it seems I have a bit of talent on it," Hardy explained modestly.</p>

  <p>His explanation rendered Luo Zheng speechless.</p>

  <p>This Qin Clan disciple was quite interesting. His manner of speaking was so fastidious despite the fact that he was just about to fight an enemy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was so close to just attacking him immediately to catch him off-guard but he restrained himself.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to gain his victory through trickery. His goal was one million and two hundred thousand points. Earning so many points couldn't be done through mere deception.</p>

  <p>If he was being honest, Luo Zheng didn't really feel that his task was realistic.</p>

  <p>It was true that he defeated Sheridan who had been ranked 40th but that was through a sucker punch using the strength source. Had Sheridan been at full strength then the battle might have turned out differently.</p>

  <p>However, he was quite confident in defeating Hardy. Still though, after winning consecutive victories, Zheng's points and ranking would quickly rise. That meant fighting with more and more powerful opponents which was going to be challenging for him. If those True Gods didn't underestimate him then he might have a slimmer chance of defeating them.</p>

  <p>He also couldn't use the Emotion Closing Godly Way which was his most powerful trump card. Up to now, Luo Zheng had no idea how he was going to face against those True Gods.</p>

  <p>Joy was the one who arranged for him to take part in this event. He could only hope that she prepared something for him. Right now, Luo Zheng had no choice but to adapt in his fights and try his best to win consecutive victories.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waited patiently for Hardy to get ready.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The milky white blade had condensed in Hardy's hand and was almost like an extension of his arm. As the blade radiance completely congealed into shape, it continued to emit countless tiny beams of light and made it look illusory.</p>

  <p>From this blade radiance alone, Luo Zheng felt a strong force of destruction.</p>

  <p>'A Godly Way activated through the Godly Tile is able to reach a higher level. Hardy is one of the weakest low-rank True Gods but his strength cannot be underestimated...' Luo Zheng surmised to himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm ready now," Hardy said with a smile. "What about you? Where are your weapons? Show me your weapons!"</p>

  <p>As a low-rank True God, Hardy felt that this battle was truly unfair to his opponent. Now that he had condensed his destruction blade using the Destruction Godly Way, he waited for Luo Zheng to do the same. He didn't want to feel apologetic and thus urged Luo Zheng to show his weapons.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the large clans on the Floating Islands were quite different. Most were arrogant and outrageous but this one in front of Luo Zheng was unusually upright.</p>

  <p>The destructive power of the blade radiance in Hardy's hand was formidable but not anything Luo Zheng couldn't deal with. He didn't need to use the Great Weighty Sword in this fight but, since Hardy was being so polite, he didn't really want to offend him by saying he wasn't qualified to let Luo Zheng show his weapon.</p>

  <p>"There's no need. Let's just get started," Luo Zheng said, taking a small step forward. All of a sudden, an unparalleled power exploded from the tip of his right foot.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a muffled thud as Luo Zheng left a small hole on the ground before rushing towards Hardy at an extremely fast rate.</p>

  <p>"Okay..."</p>

  <p>Hardy replied in an amusingly gentle tone, however, the sight of the small hole Luo Zheng caused on the ground stunned him momentarily. The ground in the Arena of Legends was illusory but it was still extremely hard to break it with physical strength. Luo Zheng managed to tear a hole just with a light tap of his toe!</p>

  <p>'How did he manage to do that? This is bad!'</p>

  <p>Hardy thought to himself but it was already too late. Luo Zheng was already dashing towards him at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Hardy was by no means weak. Given the chance of being baptized by the Arena of Legends, he might as well have a good ranking among the low-rank True Gods. The only problem was that he had never explored a forbidden land nor experienced a life-or-death fight.</p>

  <p>The sight of Luo Zheng approaching him at breakneck speed left him feeling a bit flustered.</p>

  <p>"Destruction Strike!"</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Hardy hurriedly brandished his blade radiance.</p>

  <p>If he practiced the Destruction Godly Way to a high level then his power would greatly increase. It was a pity that he had just recently grasped the Godly Way and with Zheng's Redemption Armor shielding him, his attacks posed little threat to the proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was nimble and easily dodged the blade radiance sent towards him. The numerous beams emitted by the large blade radiance were also ignored by him.</p>

  <p>These tiny beams were no joke as they also erupted a lot of power, however, they were still no match against Zheng's Redemption Armor.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Surprise was written all over Hardy's face.</p>

  <p>Those small beams were purposely spread out by him as part of his strategy. As long as he unleashed the Destruction Godly Way, the beams could form a natural barrier that could protect him. Anyone who ventured too close would have to go through these powerful beams, even an ordinary low-rank True God would find it difficult to resist.</p>

  <p>Yet here was Luo Zheng directly smashing the blade radiance with his body effortlessly.</p>

  <p>This scene made Hardy even more anxious. He waved the blade radiance in his hand even more fiercely and tiny beams flew around him once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was as calm as undisturbed water.</p>

  <p>All he needed to do was to get close enough to Hardy and pounce. Their battle could be ended easily, but the Destruction Godly Way...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really know what would happen if he collected all kinds of Godly Ways in the Infinity Ruler. His father surely had a purpose in putting it into his brain though he still wasn't quite sure how to fully use it. Once he was confident enough that he could collect others' internal momentum without great danger, then he would gladly do so.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Infinity Ruler caused Luo Zheng quite a lot of trouble every time he used it. It normally had no reaction to the outside world and he couldn't find any way of using it to see through his enemies' internal momentum.</p>

  <p>In order to activate the Infinity Ruler, Luo Zheng had to take his opponent's attacks head-on and lead their internal momentum into his brain. That was the only way the Infinity Ruler would connect with Zheng's eyes and help him see through all sorts of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler shouldn't be such a troublesome treasure but Luo Zheng still had quite a bit of trouble mastering it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Luo Zheng, Hardy's strain capacity was not very good and he was still taken aback by Zheng's speed that he still couldn't understand what his opponent was trying to do.</p>

  <p>"Air Destruction!"</p>

  <p>Given no choice, Hardy was forced to use his trump card.</p>

  <p>The Air Destruction skill was something he comprehended through the Destruction Godly Way. He still wasn't that familiar with it so he avoided using it against his opponents but the pressure he felt from Luo Zheng was too much and he found himself revealing this hidden move of his.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Countless crescent destruction blades condensed and flew around aimlessly within three thousand feet of Hardy. These blades constantly collided and garroted against each other, providing him with a sharp, powerful shield.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>There was no need to panic. Luo Zheng remained calm and simply used his movement technique against his opponent.</p>

  <p>These destruction blades were extremely sharp and contained a formidable destructive power but they weren't very fast. All the blades did was to fly around at a very slow speed.</p>

  <p>Once he used the Eight Smoky Melodies, Zheng's body became light as a feather and he found himself easily dancing around the destruction blades. As he did so, he also absorbed the internal momentum Hardy had spread out.</p>

  <p>"What, what the hell are you doing?!" Hardy shouted. He couldn't stand it having Luo Zheng badger him without attacking. If it were anyone else, then they might've already launched fiercer attacks but Luo Zheng didn't seem to have any plans of doing so.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng chose not to answer his question.</p>

  <p>The next moment, his eyes were already open wide and the edges of his pupils covered with two golden rings. These rings continued to break the mystery of the internal momentum Hardy had comprehended.</p>

  <p>Not long after.... a faint light appeared on a scale on the Infinity Ruler. As the faint light dissipated, a round blade was left behind� the mark of the Destruction Godly Way.</p>
