<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings' bodies were quite resilient. Even if they were torn to shreds, they wouldn't die, let alone be twisted.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Amidst the howling wind, the Snake Spirit King finally broke free.</p>

  <p>His huge snake body was like a long, vicious whip as it ruthlessly lashed at the ground. With a crisp sound, the entire Jade Pure Realm trembled under the impact, and Cornelius sank into the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook the hilt of his sword slightly, urging the fifteen pieces of Life Iron to return to their original positions to form the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, Zheng suddenly appeared right above the head of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"The second strike!"</p>

  <p>Before the Snake Spirit King could get up from the ground, Zheng had already thrust his sword downward.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The power of the ancestry-level bloodline was once again released, channeled through the irregular long sword.</p>

  <p>The cracks on the irregular heavy sword burst forth a blue light. It possessed more than ten abilities from the space-time quadrant.</p>

  <p>Now, neither Zheng nor the ancestry-level bloodline had a clue how the irregular heavy sword would act out.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline only needed to provide energy, while Zheng only needed to thrust the sword out.</p>

  <p>The rest was left to the irregular heavy sword itself.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The tip of the irregular heavy sword's blade connected with the Snake Spirit King's forehead.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, palm-sized blue triangle patterns appeared all over the surface of the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>From his huge head to his wriggling tail, tens of millions of blue triangles lit up.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was confused at the sight of these countless blue triangles, the Snake Spirit King felt a trace of panic.</p>

  <p>Then, the blue triangles began to split apart.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Snake Spirit King disintegrated into tens of millions of triangles!</p>

  <p>"So fast!" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Previously, when he used the Blood-controlling Method to activate the ancestry-level bloodline, he could also achieve a similar effect. However, he'd never imagined he'd be able to cut the huge snake's body into countless pieces!</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Spirit King was cut into tens of millions of pieces, he didn't accept defeat just yet. The triangles quickly transformed into small black and white snakes, all of which gathered in one spot to merge into one complete body.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Snake Spirit King recovered, Zheng appeared in front of him again. Zheng didn't plan on giving him any room to breathe.</p>

  <p>"The third strike!"</p>

  <p>Once more, the irregular heavy sword absorbed the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>From the cracks of the fifteen pieces of Life Iron, two colors, green and gray, flickered alternately. These were the six abilities of the creation quadrant and the life quadrant.</p>

  <p>Zheng watched expectantly, his eyes flashing with curiosity. He wanted to know what kind of theurgy the irregular heavy sword would unleash.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others were squirming with excitement, overjoyed at how this battle was turning out.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Snake Spirit King had used the Space Guiding Stone to suppress all of them. It was simply too depressing, as they felt they didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Now, as they watched Zheng beat up the Snake Spirit King, they felt a sense of relief and hope.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Spirit King felt the opposite; now, he was the depressed one.</p>

  <p>It was too discouraging, being beaten to a pulp by a mere human. This had never happened in tens of millions of years!</p>

  <p>Of course, the Snake Spirit King knew that this was all because of that irregular heavy sword. Back then, it was not that powerful in the hands of Kincaid.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the Snake Spirit King hissed, finally counterattacking.</p>

  <p>Clouds of black mist suddenly burst out from the black round gem, and destructive power poured out like crazy.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng had a very keen sense of discerning energy.</p>

  <p>He could tell that the energy contained in the black mist was so terrifying that he had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A black light column shot out from the clouds of black mist, heading straight for Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>As the black light column descended, the Space Guiding Stone flashed with a blue light. The space around Zheng suddenly felt extremely viscous.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could retreat, the black light column hit his body, completely enveloping him.</p>

  <p>When the black light dissipated, Zheng was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King studied his surroundings suspiciously, and even the Limited Omnipotent Stone searched crazily. However, they still weren't able to locate Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King frowned slightly, trying to calm himself down.</p>

  <p>According to the black light, Zheng should've been able to defeat Kincaid and bring out the sword smoothly after entering the altar.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was confident he could easily defeat Zheng and take back the sword.</p>

  <p>This was his plan originally.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's strength vastly exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>This countered what the black light said!</p>

  <p>Did the black light make a mistake?</p>

  <p>Or could it have lied to him?</p>

  <p>These thoughts raced through the Snake Spirit King's mind as he desperately tried to locate Zheng.</p>

  <p>It would've been fine if this was all a mistake.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King knew the strength of the black light. If it attacked, no matter how strong Zheng was, he wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>If the black light had lied to him, however, the situation would be troublesome.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Nearby, Zheng's figure appeared, but as soon as he did, a black light column shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The black light column pierced through Zheng's shadow and hit the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Zheng's figure flashed from behind the Snake Spirit King, and the black light column shot towards him once again.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>With the power of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, no matter where Zheng appeared, the Snake Spirit King could always find out in an instant and attack him with the black light column.</p>

  <p>"That black gem is very powerful," Zheng commented, as he appeared briefly from behind the Snake Spirit King once more.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't it consume a lot of Other Shore Power?"</p>

  <p>This time, even though the Snake Spirit King knew where Zheng was, he didn't use the black light column, or else it would hit him.</p>

  <p>The energy of Holy Items was limited.</p>

  <p>The Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Space Guiding Stone and this black gem consumed a lot of energy of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King used these three Holy Items, most of the Other Shore Tokens could not be used properly.</p>

  <p>"So what? The energy of the holy pillar is much more than you think. I can catch you before the energy is exhausted!" Once the Snake Spirit King finished speaking, the Space Guiding Stone flashed again with a blue light.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had been travelling through space, was forced out.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>This was the opportunity that the Snake Spirit King had been waiting for.</p>

  <p>Countless space walls surrounded Zheng. Simultaneously, the black light column enveloped him.</p>

  <p>"There's no escaping this!" the Snake Spirit King cried excitedly.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>This time, the black light column poured into Zheng's body for a few breathless moments.</p>

  <p>Through the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King could feel that Zheng's body was slowly being eroded and melted, till it finally disappeared.</p>

  <p>His biggest trouble was solved!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Zheng's voice sounded from behind the Snake Spirit King. "I forgot to tell you that your Limited Omnipotent Stone is actually very easy to deceive."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was confused, about to turn his head towards the voice.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was turning around, the irregular heavy sword once again pressed against his back, and his body was instantly cut into tens of millions of pieces.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the blazing white Light of Annihilation surged out like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>Under the erosion of the Light of Annihilation, the Snake Spirit King's broken body collapsed rapidly.</p>
