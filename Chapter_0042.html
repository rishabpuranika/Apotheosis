<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 42 Longevity Pill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over the years, there had been a large number of gifted students who studied at the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Some disciples had a penchant for learning and progressed rapidly. Within a year, those disciples passed several levels, going from bone refining level up to the level of nature refining.</p>

  <p>There were also disciples still at the bone refining level that were comparable in strength to those who were a half-step into the nature level, and could easily move objects that were as heavy as a mountain.</p>

  <p>In contrast to them, Luo Luo Zheng seemed so ordinary.</p>

  <p>For someone at the organ refining level, Luo Zheng's execution was perfect. He not only withstood an assault from four men at marrow refining level but, after that, he was still strong enough to run past the 30-mile stone tablet.</p>

  <p>However, in the eyes of the elder whose eyebrows were silver, and master Su, Luo Luo Zheng was an intermediate, not excellent candidate.</p>

  <p>Took Master Su's Drizzle Peak as an example, while it ranked last among the thirty-three peaks at the Cloud Sect, there were three disciples at least, who were able to resist that kind of attack and were able to pass the initial exam successfully.</p>

  <p>Therefore, neither of them believed Luo Luo Zheng was remarkable.</p>

  <p>To be fair, ordinarily, it was impossible for someone at the organ refining level to withstand the enormous pressure of 50, 000 pounds. Yet, Luo Luo Zheng had, all the while been standing erect with no sign of giving up.</p>

  <p>It was a miracle that he managed to beat any challenge. Whether it had been the Drizzle Peak, or any of the other thirty-two peaks at the Cloud Sect, there weren't many people who were as strong or powerful as him.</p>

  <p>Sensing tension in the air, Master Su had the urge to save Luo Luo Zheng from the mighty force. But, just as she was about to step forward, the elder with white eyebrows stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Don't be in such a hurry! Watch him," stated the chief elder as he watched Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Viewing Luo Luo Zheng carefully, Master Su was amazed to see streaks of red, blood-like liquid trickling from Luo Zheng's body. "He's refining his organs. This is absolutely astounding!" she exclaimed in awe.</p>

  <p>Unlike the four men who attacked Luo Luo Zheng earlier, both Master Su and the chief elder with white eyebrows were experienced and knowledgeable. At one glance, they recognized that the red fluid wasn't blood. Instead, it was the impurities being flushed from the organs. For most people, it took a long time to cleanse their organs. To their astonishment, Luo Luo Zheng exuded a great deal in a short period.</p>

  <p>"The boy's future ..." the chief elder stopped talking mid-sentence. He started asserting that Luo Luo Zheng would have a bright future ahead of him.</p>

  <p>However, in a high pitched voice, Master Su suddenly cut in, "His future will be gloomy, won't it?"</p>

  <p>"Master Su, what do you mean?" asked the elder confused.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he is very competent," said master Su, smiling, "It was pure luck that he scraped through the initial exam. Well, as for the present scene, we should act like it never happened."</p>

  <p>Of course, the chief elder was not an idiot, and he understood what she was attempting, and it was evident that what she was saying was absurd.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Cloud Sect, top management was to receive a step by step report of every exceptionally gifted disciple discovered during an initial exam, and it was equally clear that Luo Zheng's case fell precisely under this rule.</p>

  <p>"Let me think..." murmured the chief elder examiner, feeling torn, and wanting to think a moment. His thoughts were troubled by this. It would be no problem to turn a blind eye to Luo Zheng's previous performance. But with what he was witnessing now, there could be no doubt the young man was the sort of special refiner that only occurred once in a thousand years. It was too much to hide the truth.</p>

  <p>"No need to hesitate!" declared Master Su after seeing concern etched in the chief examiner's face. Her dazzling smile faded slowly. "Do you want me to reveal the Emperor's Token?"</p>

  <p>When he heard the words, 'the Emperor's Token, ' the chief examiner coughed harshly. Ever since Master Su arrived at the Cloud Sect, his health was progressively getting worse. As long as there was an initial exam, the chief examiner was troubled by her.</p>

  <p>So, what was the Emperor's Token?</p>

  <p>Any person in possession of the Emperor's Token had the right to order 'the man' in the Burning Sky Palace to perform any act, including, commit murder, slaughter, genocide, or any other atrocity.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, people became scared at the mention of the Emperor's Token.</p>

  <p>No one and nothing on earth could stop 'the man'. He was nearly all-powerful.</p>

  <p>But, this was under the assumption that the person giving the instructions had one of the Emperor's Tokens. Otherwise, you were not able to order 'the man'.</p>

  <p>In over two hundred years, the Burning Sky Palace released only six of these Emperor's Tokens, total.</p>

  <p>One piece had thankfully gone to the Ou-yang clan of the Imperial Capital, and it was revered in their main shrine. In the past, the Ou-yang was an insignificant, small clan. Utilizing the control that came with the Emperor's Token, the family became one of the top ten noble clans throughout the Empire.</p>

  <p>Although the prosperity of the clan came to the family through their diligent administration, the Emperor's Token undoubtedly played a significant role.</p>

  <p>Who would dare offend a person that possessed the Emperor's Token?</p>

  <p>'Even though the young man is indeed very talented, he isn't worth the Emperor's Token. Master Su is exaggerating, ' thought the chief examiner.</p>

  <p>Well aware of Master Su's character, the chief elder knew she was bluffing him. But he knew better she would possibly use the Emperor's Token if he kept failing to realize her purpose.</p>

  <p>Clearly, the elder would consent to her request. "Since you have decided, we won't report the matter," the chief examiner informed Master Su willingly.</p>

  <p>"Okay, but, keep in mind! I want everyone to be in the dark about him.</p>

  <p>Remove all the pictures that were recorded onto the picture slab. Can't let anyone but you and I see. By the way, we had better shut him down. If people in other peaks know, we'll be in big trouble!" warned Master Su.</p>

  <p>When she had finished speaking to the elder examiner, she went back to lustfully ogling Luo Luo Zheng and appreciating him as one did to an uncarved gem.</p>

  <p>During their discussion, Luo Luo Zheng was concentrating on allowing the warm current to wash through his body as he absorbed the pressure. The impurities of his organs were almost cleared up.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath as he was quaked by a violent shudder ripping through his body which brought a flood of red contaminants pouring from his pores as if he were bleeding heavily.</p>

  <p>'Finally! I've reached the highest degree of the organ refining level. Soon, I'll begin marrow refining as long as I cross that mark.'</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng contemplated, his eyes shone with pleasure. He was delighted at the pace of his progress. He was advancing so rapidly, that it wouldn't be long before he could defeat Perrin and rescue his sister from Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Right now though, he was excited to continue refining, thinking that, if he did, he might be able to achieve the marrow refining level.</p>

  <p>But, his legs began to shake under the enormous pressure bearing down on him until eventually he couldn't stand and was at the point of collapse.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment he felt someone seized him by the neck and pulled him out of the road.</p>

  <p>Feeling the pressure bearing down on him diffused, Luo Luo Zheng turned easily and saw that it was the chief examiner, supervisor for the initial exam who had hauled him away. Standing next to the elder examiner, was a girl, as beautiful as a fairy, attired in green. She was gorgeous!</p>

  <p>"You passed the initial exam. Why haven't you left? What are you still doing here?" asked the chief elder sharply. 'After all, the boy did cause the unpleasantness of today, ' thought the elder chief examiner.</p>

  <p>Being scolded by the elder, Luo Luo Zheng remained calm as he apologized, "Sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to be here, Sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, now you know. Take your jade pendant to substitute an entrance card, then go wait for your entrance exam," commanded the chief elder examiner.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to irk the chief examiner, Luo Luo Zheng began to walk away politely.</p>

  <p>After a few steps, he looked back and asked, "Excuse me, Sir. If I am lucky enough to be accepted into the Cloud Sect, may I come back here?"</p>

  <p>Using pressure to refine his body, Luo Luo Zheng had accelerated his refining speed and was slightly addicted to it.</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's request, the elder smiled coldly and said, "This is the place for those who have reached the nature level to practice. If you want to come, you need to use your earned points. We won't hold you accountable for today's illegal trespassing. But, don't tell anyone! You have to remember to keep today a secret!"</p>

  <p>Nodding meekly, Luo Luo Zheng scurried away.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng was gone, the elder turned to Master Su and asked, "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Master Su answered offhandedly, "In return, I have this for you."</p>

  <p>She felt some compassion for the old man. On Master Su's finger was a beautiful five-colored floret ring, studded with five different colored gems.</p>

  <p>As the chief elder watched, she gently touched the ring with her finger, and instantly, a bright silver pill popped up which she casually tossed at him.</p>

  <p>The chief elder was tremendously shocked when he saw what it was.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary and generous person you are!" the chief elder's voice trembled as he thanked her.</p>

  <p>In the chief elder's palm was a Longevity Pill. One of these pills could extend a person's life a year. The Longevity Pill was extremely rare, precious medicine, especially to an elderly man.</p>

  <p>They said time was money. But, even the wealthiest people in the world didn't have enough riches to buy time. One more year meant a lot to those who were in their waning years.</p>

  <p>It was entirely unexpected for Master Su to award the chief elder examiner with such a precious gift. Had it not been for fear of being humiliated, he would have been in tears right there.</p>
