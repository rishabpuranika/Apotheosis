  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The sound of his fist smashing on the heavy irregular sword echoed around the stone hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't remember how many punches he had thrown by now. Every time the sword broke, it would just quickly repair itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt exhausted.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline was also repairing his body. A few green lightning bolts flashed across the blood-colored sky in his inner world and poured into his body, dispelling the fatigue.</p>

  <p>"Can't we just get this over with?" Luo Zheng was getting impatient. "Can't you just analyze the structure of the Life Iron so I can attack its weakness?"</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng was able to counterattack more efficiently when he knew his opponents' energy structures.</p>

  <p>Those calibrated counterattacks had always proven effective, allowing him to beat the likes of Othniel, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Shouldn't he be using the same tactic on the Life Iron now?</p>

  <p>"The Life Iron has a weakness, but it's from the Stellar World, and my power can't handle it so well after it was downgraded," the ancestry-level bloodline admitted.</p>

  <p>The omnipotent ancestry-level bloodline had finally met its match.</p>

  <p>"So we have no choice but to exhaust its energy?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Infinite power against a limited one. It will definitely be defeated that way," the ancestry-level bloodline said.</p>

  <p>"All right then!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng steeled himself then continued throwing out stronger punches, expending more power and moving faster.</p>

  <p>As this went on, a pair of starry eyes observed Luo Zheng from inside the black armor.</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit King Kincaid was still in an unconscious state, but like the old man outside, he also had a vague sense of the outside world.</p>

  <p>Kincaid was a leader of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>He was not as smart as Cornelius, nor as fast as Sheehan, nor as strong as Orlando.</p>

  <p>But his power was the most balanced.</p>

  <p>He had all the characteristics of the other three kings.</p>

  <p>He had ended up in the chaos after a miscalculation when the Snake Spirit King had come to kill him, but he held on to his broken body and set a death trap in this place before his life force ran out.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had tried repeatedly, but failed every time.</p>

  <p>Kincaid calculated that the Snake Spirit King would not be able to break the trap unless he resorted to using the power behind him.</p>

  <p>But if he did that, he would never get what he wanted.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Spirit King, no one else had tried to break into this place again for a long time.</p>

  <p>The long years had been torture for Kincaid.</p>

  <p>'Why hasn't anyone come yet?</p>

  <p>Has Cornelius completely sealed this place?</p>

  <p>Did something happen to them?'</p>

  <p>Although Kincaid knew that the possibility of someone getting through was slim, he still held on to hope someone would be able to do it.</p>

  <p>Finally, today, a human had broken in!</p>

  <p>Humans were just creatures brought into existence by the world builders.</p>

  <p>Although they were very similar to human spirits, there was still a huge gap between them.</p>

  <p>That was to say, if human spirits were paintings done by a master, human race was mere scribbles done by a child.</p>

  <p>If this human named Luo Zheng could not match Kincaid's will, he would definitely just end up dead.</p>

  <p>However, Kincaid had been shocked to see Luo Zheng's progress so far.</p>

  <p>How could there be such a powerful warrior in the chaos?</p>

  <p>His speed, strength and even understanding and use of space were beyond those of the Life Sword.</p>

  <p>How could it be possible?</p>

  <p>The methods that Luo Zheng was displaying now surprised Kincaid even more.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was countering the Life Sword, planning to exhaust the power of the sword bit by bit.</p>

  <p>'He could do it.'</p>

  <p>The ridiculous idea rose in Kincaid's mind.</p>

  <p>This gave him hope. Perhaps this human could change everything.</p>

  <p>But the chances were too small.</p>

  <p>Back then, Kincaid had combined the intelligence of the entire Human Spirit Sect to set the trap here. Only after he was awakened could it be undone. It was not that he looked down on Luo Zheng, but it was nearly impossible to defeat him here.</p>

  <p>The Life Sword was only the first challenge. Once the Life Sword was defeated, it would turn into the Death Sword. There was no way Luo Zheng could survive.</p>

  <p>'Alas, I shouldn't have set such a complicated trap at that time, '</p>

  <p>Kincaid thought, irritated with himself.</p>

  <p>But he also knew that if he hadn't done that, the Snake Spirit King would have already taken him down. It was quite the dilemma.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gonggong, Zhurong and the Wing King were all gathered atop the altar, careful not to reveal their presence.</p>

  <p>An air of doom and gloom hung around them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters and snake-shaped Treacherous Beings had them surrounded. Just as Luo Zheng warned, the Snake Spirit King had discovered their location and ordered the members of the Snake Spirit Sect to rush here.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they can see us?" asked Fuxi cautiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied as he shook his head. "Even the Snake Spirit King can't see through the Space Deception Method with the Limited Omnipotent Stone."</p>

  <p>"Then we should show ourselves," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suggested.</p>

  <p>After all, they were here to prevent the Treacherous Beings from entering the altar, not to avoid them.</p>

  <p>"Right! If we're to die here, let's go out with a fight!" Zhurong said, all riled up.</p>

  <p>The human heroes hadn't had the chance to fight yet after they cultivated the Blood-controlling Method.</p>

  <p>Zhurong had already considered himself much more lucky than those who had been killed by the Space Devouring Technique before.</p>

  <p>But the Primeval Lord of Heaven laid a hand on his shoulder before he could move.</p>

  <p>"What is it? Are you afraid to die?" Zhurong sniped, glaring at the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head slightly. "Don't act recklessly. Wait for the right moment."</p>

  <p>Time passed slowly.</p>

  <p>More and more Treacherous Beings arrived at the mountain. Some of the Snake Masters were itching to raid the altar, but they didn't dare to make a move before the Snake Spirit King gave the order.</p>

  <p>Finally, a huge figure emerged from the side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The human heroes couldn't help but feel unnerved at the sight of the Snake Spirit King, even if they had been preparing to face him.</p>

  <p>"Here he is. Now's the time to show ourselves," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>They then neutralized the Space Deception Method and made themselves visible to the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Spirit King just continued to slither slowly to the altar with no reaction, as if their sudden appearance didn't matter at all to him.</p>

  <p>Sewell, who was beside him, sneered at the heroes, "What are you doing?</p>

  <p>Are you guarding the altar? How funny!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke calmly, "We are not alone."</p>

  <p>Then he waved his hand gently.</p>

  <p>Many coordinates were thrown out.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House came back to life, one after another.</p>

  <p>Sewell spotted Alphonse, Hamilton and the others and began to laugh. "It hadn't been easy for you to escape, but you return to die. Fools!"</p>
