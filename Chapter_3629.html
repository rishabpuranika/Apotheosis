<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3629 Being A Backbone </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The penetrating power of the Sharp-winged Jin Wu was indeed amazing. If they went for a head-on collision with the important positions of the array, they would definitely cause a tremendous impact on the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>With that, everyone was trying their very best to stop the Sharp-winged Jin Wu from coming down and approaching the array.</p>

  <p>"Take this! Straight Strike!" Sinclair shouted mightily.</p>

  <p>The long sword that was floating outside began exerting fierce momentum.</p>

  <p>Then it started dashing through the targets while faint cracking sounds echoed through space. Due to the intense and impressive sword momentum, some of the Sharp-winged Jin Wu had already been slashed to pieces even before the sword actually touched them.</p>

  <p>Judging from the token he just used, everybody could notice the big difference in strength between Taiyi Generals and the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Most theurgies that Taiyi Generals exerted were straightforward but powerful. They had no fancy moves but focused on annihilating the target through intense power. The only shortcoming that one could observe was the lack of agility.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief used different swordsmanship theurgies that had one thing in common. Their theurgies were skillful and full of elegance but were noticeably insufficient in power.</p>

  <p>However, these Sharp-winged Jin Wu weren't that strong enough. Thus, even the swordsmanship theurgies of the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were enough to kill them.</p>

  <p>In fact, the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had killed more Sharp-winged Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"There's only one key to killing these Sharp-winged Jin Wu? exert quick and full-powered attack towards your target. Remember that, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This way, you can be more efficient in dealing with your enemies." The swordsmanship token that Basil was using was similar to that of Sinclair.</p>

  <p>He wanted to show and teach Luo Zheng that their way of dealing with the enemies was more effective and efficient.</p>

  <p>"Did you just say efficient?"</p>

  <p>After looking at the surroundings for a while, Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed. He gently raised his hand and shouted, "Rise!"</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>One hundred and twenty-eight long swords suddenly turned into a sword stream and shot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>As Basil saw this, he only knew that Luo Zheng had easily created these long swords out of the array with his Power Shaping skill. What he didn't know was the method of controlling the long swords was what Luo Zheng learned from the Grand Purple Aura Technique.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>One of the long swords pierced through a Sharp-winged Sun Crow which immediately turned into a puddle of blood.</p>

  <p>The transparent swords contained some Jun of force and a part of the Mountain Sea Pass. As long as the Mountain Sea Pass remained undamaged, these swords could stay pretty invincible.</p>

  <p>With a wave of Luo Zheng's hand, the swords scattered in various directions.</p>

  <p>Shing! Shing! Shing!</p>

  <p>Each long sword instantly pierced through dozens of Sharp-winged Jin Wu. In just a matter of seconds, thousands of them fell victim and died.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Basil's long sword swirled wildly in the air, killing many Sharp-winged Jin Wu one by one. There were thousands of enemies on the position he guarded, but in just a minute, he obliterated all the Sharp-winged Jin Wu who came in his way. As he completed his task, a proud look on his face was very visible.</p>

  <p>Basil looked around to check on others, and Luo Zheng caught his eye. He smirked at the sight of Luo Zheng exerting more than a hundred swords simultaneously. He thought that it was a fancy but a rather inefficient move. There was no doubt in his mind that no warrior could possibly control over a hundred swords all at the same time.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Sharp-winged Jin Wu were not that smart, but were extremely agile.</p>

  <p>In his mind, if Luo Zheng was really using this skill, he presumed that there was no way Luo Zheng could stab even a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow in the air. Well, if he was pretty lucky, then he might pierce a few ones by chance.</p>

  <p>However, his eyes widened and his jaw almost dropped as he took a closer look upon Luo Zheng's area.</p>

  <p>The number of dead bodies on Luo Zheng's side was easily a hundred times more than what Basil accomplished.</p>

  <p>Each of Luo Zheng's transparent swords seemed to have a soul of its own as they continuously darted upwards.</p>

  <p>Shing! Splat!</p>

  <p>Every time a Sharp-winged Sun Crow got pierced by the sword, it would explode into a messy cloud of blood.</p>

  <p>Around every sword, clouds of blood continuously formed and spread in the air, dyeing the surrounding space with a misty autumn afternoon scenery.</p>

  <p>With every sword shooting upwards, thousands of Sharp-winged Jin Wu were vanquished, and after a few rounds of merciless assault from Luo Zheng, perhaps more than one hundred thousand were slaughtered in his hands.</p>

  <p>However, the Sharp-winged Jin Wu were not afraid of death, being creatures of low intelligence. In fact, the more they were killed, the more they became aggressive and attacked without regard for their lives. But regardless of their sheer number, Luo Zheng's swords drilled them all, not letting a single one escape. Soon, the sky above became clear and silent, as not a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow was to be found. Nothing but a pool of blood and dismembered bodies were left below.</p>

  <p>"That Taiyi General is invincible!"</p>

  <p>"He controls over one hundred swords like they were parts of his hands.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, every sword's power is equivalent to what a single Taiyi General could exert. That makes his power almost equivalent to that of a hundred Taiyi Generals!"</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness. We don't need to do anything!"</p>

  <p>The warriors in the lower tier of the Mountain Sea Pass were so excited at what they saw, they almost burst in tears.</p>

  <p>The nine important positions of the array looked pretty indestructible. The big array passed through the Sky Net and was located in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a possibility that the array might collapse if it received an overwhelming volume of attacks.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was earlier agreed upon that if the array suffered serious damage, Sinclair would order the Taiyi Guards to release the warriors in the lower tier, though that order would most likely endanger them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, now that Luo Zheng had eliminated all the Sharp-winged Jin Wu on his own, the warriors didn't need to come out. Thus, they were all greatly relieved.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Jago! Is he really your Flag Master?" an old man asked with his eyes wide open due to extreme shock.</p>

  <p>Jago proudly nodded and replied, "Yes! He used to belong to the Sword Light Palace. Then, he brought us to the Dragon City."</p>

  <p>"You've only been in the Dragon City for a few years but he instantly grew into such a powerful warrior!" another strong man remarked in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>Earlier, they had heard Jago addressing Luo Zheng as Flag Master but they still found it quite hard to believe.</p>

  <p>After all, most of these warriors were from the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>They knew well about several powerful masters in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>It was already very difficult for a Flag Master to become an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>Moreover, to become a Taiyi Guard, a warrior needed great opportunities and talents. However, Luo Zheng even skipped that and directly became a Taiyi General.</p>

  <p>Even the warriors who witnessed what Luo Zheng underwent with their own eyes found it unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"If you doubt me, you can ask Jaxon and Chace. They were all born in the Dragon City and have seen Flag Master Luo Zheng before," Jago insisted.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng was still a Flag Master, he had defeated Alliance Chiefs.</p>

  <p>This event left a deep impression on the members of Dragon City.</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly honest, it was really hard to believe that he was the same Luo Zheng that we knew before."</p>

  <p>"We know that he easily defeated Fergus, but I still didn't expect him to reach this far in such a short time!"</p>

  <p>There were mixed emotions as they looked at Luo Zheng standing still and stained in red, matching the color of the blood mist that he created in the sky. Some were in awe, while others shivered. But one thing was for sure, Luo Zheng's current strength was enough to serve as a backbone of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>There were about two to three million Sharp-winged Jin Wu in the first dark cloud.</p>

  <p>Previously, even with the twelve Taiyi Generals going all out to subdue the enemies, a considerable number of Sharp-winged Jin Wu were still able to crash into the important positions of the array. These kamikaze attacks were enough to destroy the array in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there were hundreds of warriors stationed in the Mountain Sea Pass on standby. Their purpose was to pour divine crystals into the array to continuously repair it. Once it couldn't be repaired, the Mountain Sea Pass would collapse.</p>

  <p>However, this time around, not a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow was able to lay a hand on the array. More than half of their total number was wiped out and fell victim to Luo Zheng's swords. Even if there were a few occasional ones who escaped, they were quickly hunted down by the other Taiyi Generals.</p>

  <p>After killing the Sharp-winged Jin Wu, Luo Zheng slowly retracted his hands.</p>

  <p>The one hundred and twenty-eight long swords withdrew and returned into the ground.</p>

  <p>Basil had always shown Luo Zheng the respect he deserved, but on the inside, he didn't take him seriously.</p>

  <p>He used to be a Taiyi Guard. After he became a five-star one, he entered the Chaotic Source World, and then he joined the Land of Sword Grief to cultivate further.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't able to get to the second floor so he returned to be a Taiyi Guard. As a Taiyi General now, he had the tendency of looking down upon the warriors from the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, he stared at Luo Zheng, rendered speechless.</p>
