<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Lady Poison-blood from Bloodwood Cliff and Raven from Black Mountain Sect could be easily dealt with. They were good, yes, but not ones who could scare a warrior off. Although belonging to the fourth-grade sects, both Bloodwood Cliff and Black Mountain Sect were still very different from Cloud Hall, because the latter was well known as the best fourth-grade sect, housing some of the brightest warriors with huge potentials to be honed.</p>

  <p>The fifth-grade sect, Ethereal Spirit Sect was different. It was the largest, and most influential force in the Central Region apart from World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's and Raven's faces lit up at the sight of Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit coming to them.</p>

  <p>At the Martial Arts Contest, tension rose high as the belonging of Dragon Soar Arena would be decided there. Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect, Mysterious Luna Hall as well as some independent warriors would have a chance to get it.</p>

  <p>However, Dragon Soar Arena wasn't the key problem here. Investigation results showed that runes on the Dragon Soar Arena had already been altered and Luo Zheng was the only guy who was able to use it to fly to the Upper World. What on earth did Luo Zheng do to those runes? Because of this commotion, the focus was shifted from the Dragon Soar Arena to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What could he be hiding? Luo Zheng was nervous, his eyes averted every single one of the other warriors who were in the area.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't tell the truth about Dragon Soar Arena, it would be useless even though those warriors had got it. They needed the arena to enter the Upper World, and that was the only thing that mattered. Its functions for martial arts refining weren't that important to them.</p>

  <p>Nobody expected that a disciple from Cloud hall knew the Dragon Soar Arena best. They could not let Luo Zheng go, after all, their ultimate goal was to go to the Upper World through the arena.</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused on how such a warrior of low cultivation level be able to understand those complicated runes. Where did he get the knowledge? Who taught him? The people in the area were so quiet, but their thoughts were so deafening. To everyone's knowledge, only one sect was capable of making Luo Zheng stay at the scene--the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Their words were the orders which couldn't be defied. The most powerful warriors dictated the rules in the world. They were the gods. Anyone who would dare defy the words of the gods would suffer terrible consequences.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's and Raven's eyes rolled. 'Cloud Hall warriors will never be at the same level as Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit!' they thought.</p>

  <p>They gloated over the idea that Cloud Hall would find it hard to deal with Ethereal Spirit Sect which was more powerful and influential. What was more, there were still two extremely powerful and strong people in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Even Yudie's master couldn't beat them easily. They were very skilled. In fact, they were two of the most feared in the competition.</p>

  <p>They wanted to know how Ning Yudie would respond to their presence. Lady Poison-blood and Raven wanted to intimidate Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The frown on Yudie's forehead began to melt. Her eyes seemed to be as deep as sea. She was in trouble. Would she, the leader of all the disciples in the Cloud Hall, fail to protect one of her disciples? A leader would do anything to protect her members. Ning Yudie looked over her shoulder and saw that there were snowflakes falling from the sky. She just shrugged it off.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng serves the Cloud Hall. I don't know how's he related to the Dragon Soar Arena, but he's one of my people and I feel obliged to protect him.</p>

  <p>Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect and Ethereal Spirit Sect, none of you will succeed in forcing me to give up my disciple."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Ning Yudie sounded calm, with a regal Mu Ning. She was revered as a leader in the sect and she announced her decision with a look of grim determination.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a loud quack was heard from the sky.</p>

  <p>There was a pause with what everyone was doing. People all looked up and saw the icy phoenix flying across the sky. The phoenix was bigger and more mature than ever before! Everyone noticed that it had already grown up. Spanning ten feet in length, its body, which was made of ice, showed the shivering beauty of frost in every angle.</p>

  <p>As soon as the icy phoenix appeared, it flew towards Ning Yudie and landed in front of her. The phoenix burst a loud quack, tucked its wings, and gazed at Ning Yudie as if it were waiting for her to react.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie raised her head, and looked up to the phoenix. She felt her body was shrouded by the icy light radiated by the icy phoenix. Inside the light, Yudie's small body was hugged by the opaque ice, her visibility cut in half.</p>

  <p>Light grew brighter and brighter. A few moments after, icy crystals gradually formed around her. Inch by inch the crystals covered her whole body, nothing was spared.</p>

  <p>The icy crystals fused together and finally became an icy armor covering Yudie's body. Every part of her body was protected, which made her figure flattering. Even if a thousand arrows were to be set free, she would still be alive with this kind of armor that she had.</p>

  <p>The icy light slowly disappeared, leaving her whole body visible to the naked eyes. To everyone's surprise, even phoenix feathers started to grow on her back like wildfire.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie blinked, and she noticed icy crystals hung on her eyebrows. She stretched out her hand, looking at all the other things that had changed since her metamorphosis. Then everyone noticed that an icy blue halberd had appeared on her hand.</p>

  <p>This halberd, made of unknown kind of ice, was as long as the phoenix. It was so long that two Yudies could measure it up.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows, confused. Last time on the Cloud Road, he had never seen Ning Yudie using this halberd. He couldn't imagine that such a tiny girl had the strength to wield it in a battle.</p>

  <p>Was this the warrior Ning Yudie? Luo Zheng looked at her with great interest.</p>

  <p>The stone-faced Lady Poison-blood and Raven felt disappointed. They had wished and expected Ning Yudie to behave herself and stay out of it. But she was never ready to give up Luo Zheng. Although Cloud Hall could never succeed in defying Ethereal Spirit Sect, Ning Yudie still wanted Luo Zheng to grow even more under her wings.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had already made up her mind to protect Luo Zheng as well as any of her disciples. Whoever tried to put her warriors in trouble, she was ready to fight for them even if she was going to fight such unfriendly and vicious warriors. Was she crazy for doing this?</p>
