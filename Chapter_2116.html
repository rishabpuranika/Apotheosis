  <p>
</p>

  <p>The strands of black thread were like thick locks of hair. A part of them fused into Zheng's body and coiled around his cinnabar field, and the rest just disappeared.</p>

  <p>He looked at the blue sky and let out a long exhale.</p>

  <p>It had been a long day. He was greatly disappointed that his cinnabar field was sealed, but at least he was still alive. That was good, right?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed. Looking far into the distance, a rich vegetable field caught his attention. Its wide expanse was out of this world, the lush green fields extending as wide as the ocean.</p>

  <p>And now, he was standing in the middle of it.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this place?"</p>

  <p>Though ruled by True Gods and Holy Beings, there were also mortals with low levels of cultivation that lived in the divine land. Could it be that this vegetable field was theirs?</p>

  <p>No, Luo Zheng frowned. The soil under his feet was soil of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm or Spirit Supreme Realm would have to exert much effort to reclaim this field. Ordinary mortals wouldn't be able to move a piece of dirt.</p>

  <p>"Then these seedlings..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached for a seedling and studied it closely. He could not identify what type it was, but it was certainly a tough one. It didn't break under Zheng's fingers when he casually pinched it, and only when he had used 1% of his strength did the seed break.</p>

  <p>"Huh," muttered Luo Zheng. "This is tougher that a sacred weapon in the Evolutionary Universe."</p>

  <p>Obviously, these vegetables weren't for ordinary mortals to eat. What mortal could bite a sacred weapon to pieces?</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Zheng regretted not asking Wynn about the local customs of the divine land. That way, he would've known a little more about this place, and he wouldn't be so lost.</p>

  <p>Refusing to wander aimlessly, Luo Zheng chose a direction and started to trek.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't fly or travel through space in the divine land, he had an extremely strong physique and his running speed wasn't too slow.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect however, was that six hours later, when he had traveled ten thousand miles, he was still in the lush green vegetable field.</p>

  <p>This field was endless!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was distraught. No matter which angle he looked at it, this world just didn't seem real. Was this preposterous illusion really the divine land?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a moment to calm himself before continuing on his way. There was no use panicking.</p>

  <p>No matter how big this field was, Luo Zheng believed that it ended somewhere.</p>

  <p>It would just take some more time and effort to reach its edge.</p>

  <p>As he ran, Luo Zheng observed the black threads that were coiled around his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng wanted to use his power to cut off the threads, but the cinnabar field was the most important and most fragile part of a martial artist so he had to be careful.</p>

  <p>But then, he discovered that the black threads were intertwined with his cinnabar field, so it was impossible to remove them without destroying the cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>Now, he found that the threads were eroding under his blood circulation.</p>

  <p>The strands on the side of his cinnabar field had become much thinner and seemed to be on the verge of breaking.</p>

  <p>'This golden blood actually has such use!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought excitedly. If his cinnabar field was always sealed, it would be a genuine concern to Luo Zheng. Once he encountered some powerful enemy, he would have no way to resist.</p>

  <p>The golden blood had the ability to avoid the black palm print, and now he found out it had miraculous effects on the black threads too!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng forced the blood in his veins to surge into the cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>This would be suicide for ordinary mortals, but for Luo Zheng, it wouldn't be a problem even if his internal organs moved. Directing a large amount of golden blood to his cinnabar field should be a piece of cake and cause no damage to him.</p>

  <p>And so, Luo Zheng tried to remove the black threads as he continued to run.</p>

  <p>Night came eventually. The lush green field disappeared from Zheng's view and was replaced by a dark world. A white moon hung in the sky. It seemed that even in the divine land, a moon shone.</p>

  <p>Every Holy Being tried their best to create the perfect universe for themselves, their work oftentimes influenced by the divine land. It was just how the minds of living beings worked.</p>

  <p>For example, when a person saw a ship for the first time and decided to create one themselves, the ship they would build would be affected by their previous experience.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the moon before his eyes was the one true moon.</p>

  <p>Along with the night came a thick layer of fog that covered the vegetable field. It was eerily quiet, and only rustling sounds could be heard as Luo Zheng ran across the field.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"What...?" He did a one-eighty as he scanned his surroundings carefully.</p>

  <p>A look of vigilance flashed through his eyes. He held his breath and listened attentively.</p>

  <p>It was completely silent. No wind, no sounds...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned but resumed running nonetheless.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>He had just taken a step forward, then there it was again! Luo Zheng stopped and turned to the direction of the sound but it had stopped already.</p>

  <p>Now, he was certain that something was following him. Closing his eyes, he released his soul power and searched the perimeter.</p>

  <p>Everything around him was reflected in his mind however, there really were only hard soil and seedlings around.</p>

  <p>"What the hell..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and began to walk again.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he stepped forward, he heard the sound again. And as soon as he stopped and looked back, the sound disappeared. It was very strange!</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Zheng simply ignored it and kept running at high speed. In a few seconds, he was able to cover several miles. He was as fast as a shooting arrow.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't take longer than that for him to figure out where the sound was coming from.</p>

  <p>In the space in front of him, a black cricket the size of a puppy had appeared and every time its hind legs pushed off the ground, a dull patter sound was made.</p>

  <p>"This cricket is following me!" Zheng's eyebrows had raised slightly. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a swarm of black insects pop out, all of them as big as a puppy. Soon, Luo Zheng was surrounded.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click! Click! Click! Click..."</p>

  <p>Jumping sounds filled the night as the army of crickets gathered around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak…"</p>

  <p>The crickets began chirping. The sound that hundreds of crickets made was deafening, as if the crickets were the only creatures that existed in this world. It did not last very long, though.</p>

  <p>After they conversed for a while, the area became quiet once again.</p>

  <p>However, the crickets which glowed under the full moon looked at Luo Zheng with greedy eyes. They were looking at him like food!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made a face. "Were you discussing how to divide me among yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Clatter!"</p>

  <p>One of the crickets jumped up. As the puppy-sized cricket leaped into the air, it spread its wings and swooped down towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But just as it got close, a fist sent it flying to the other direction.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a surprised look on his face as he clenched his right fist and looked at the cricket that was thrown away by him.</p>

  <p>Even though his cinnabar field was sealed, his physical strength and the power in the Eight Path Platforms couldn't be underestimated. At least this strength was ten times that of an ordinary world lord. Luo Zheng frowned and pursed his lips. His punch should have shattered the cricket but there it was, unscathed.</p>
