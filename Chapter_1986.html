</p>

  <p>No secrets could be kept from Luo Luo Zheng in the areas covered by the will of the worlds.</p>

  <p>It was therefore quite simple for Luo Luo Zheng to find Supreme Lord Leroy's location of hiding.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng's objective was very clear: to kill the two other queens of the Demon Night at the lowest of costs. After making the Demon Night abandon their attack, he would focus all his attention on fighting against the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng though, was an outsider after all, and there still hadn't been any reaction from Xun's soul. All he could do now was place his hopes in the Demon Night's Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members that were present had faces that were still brimming with confusion.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had disappeared for many years. Ten years ago, it was unknown whether or not he was still alive at that time. Years had already passed since Supreme Lord Leroy had spoken through the Roaring Token, which proved that he hadn't died at the time. Luo Luo Zheng had now suddenly told them that he could bring them to see Supreme Lord Leroy. For the Demon Night members, the latter was still very hard to believe.</p>

  <p>On another note, it was undeniable that this human youth before them had Xun's soul attached to him. This Luo Luo Zheng guy probably knew more than what they had ever known. Hence, they couldn't help but feel a strong sense of anticipation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't say another word. He lightly flicked the Teleportation Token in his hand and a streak of blazing light appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please follow me," said Luo Luo Zheng, as he stepped into the vortex of light and disappeared right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The beam of blazing light continued to spin in front of everyone, like a gate leading to another strange world. Despite the magical sight, a trace of hesitation still pulsed through the group. Should they really follow a warrior from another race? After all, to a certain extent, following Luo Luo Zheng was tantamount to betraying the Demon Night. To the loyal Demon Night members, this was even more painful than being tortured by the Punishment of Eternal Night.</p>

  <p>Amber suddenly acted instinctively, without any hesitation at all. She walked toward the beam of light, her bare feet leading the way. Beneath the blazing white light, her snow-white face looked extremely beautiful.</p>

  <p>It was as if she was suddenly bathing in a pool of holy light. She spoke loudly, "I'm a Demon Night warrior that ascended from the Lower World!"</p>

  <p>When the Demon Night members heard her speak, a confused expression appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>There were over three thousand Demon Night members that had been saved by Luo Luo Zheng, and among them were over a thousand world lords as well as two grand world lords. These Demon Night warriors were practically all from noble families and great clans of the Demon Night race, and because they had offended Yao, they were imprisoned on the Prison Island.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Amber came off as a misfit to them. She was only a Soul Sea Realm warrior and it seemed as though she had literally just stepped into the Soul Sea Realm not too long ago.</p>

  <p>Now that they heard Amber confirm that she had ascended from the Lower World, a revelation came over the group concerning her ordinary cultivation level. Simultaneously, they were equally confused. Why exactly was there a Demon Night member of the Lower World imprisoned here on the Prison Island?</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warriors had specifications for being locked up here!</p>

  <p>Not everyone was qualified to be taken to Prison Island.</p>

  <p>"I watched Luo Luo Zheng as he grew stronger. And even then, our Queen of Killings was already attached to him." Amber continued, "It was at that time that I offended the Queen of Punishment, so that's why I was imprisoned here.</p>

  <p>Regarding the dispute between queens, I have no right to make any comment. What I can say is that I believe in Luo Luo Zheng, not Xun. He can carry the Demon Night out of this predicament!" Once her statement completed, Amber turned her head and entered the bright beam of light.</p>

  <p>Amber's words were actually quite outrageous, if not to say ridiculous.</p>

  <p>She said she didn't believe in Xun, but chose to believe in a human instead!</p>

  <p>The faces of the Demon Night members became stunned at once.</p>

  <p>There was a known proverb that spread in the language of the Demon Night race. If it was translated into straightforward words, it basically meant that although taking the life of a Demon Night member was simple, it would be very difficult to make them betray their own race.</p>

  <p>Right now though, Amber was basically announcing that she had betrayed the Demon Night race and was going to follow a human warrior.</p>

  <p>"I want to meet Supreme Lord Leroy!" One of the Demon Night world lords finally spoke, making up her mind. She walked towards the blazing light, her slender figure promptly disappearing into it.</p>

  <p>"I want to see him, too..." A second member of the Demon Night race also walked over and went into the beam of light.</p>

  <p>"I?"</p>

  <p>Actually, for the most of them, they thought the same as Amber did.</p>

  <p>They might have chosen to believe Luo Luo Zheng, but their experiences were different from Amber's, and they were therefore unwilling to speak out in front of everyone. Supreme Lord Leroy had become their best excuse for following Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a result, more and more members of the Demon Night race walked into the beam of light Luo Luo Zheng had created.</p>

  <p>It certainly didn't take long before all of the Demon Night's warriors had left, all except for Sammy and Fannie.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to stop them?" Sammy asked Fannie, who was beside her.</p>

  <p>Fannie bit her lip hard. The taste of blood immediately spread to her mouth. "I'm not sure why, but I feel like they did the right thing."</p>

  <p>The two of them belonged to the Saint Chain Sect and were followers of the Queen of Punishment. True, their stance was completely different, but right now, Fannie's heart began to waver.</p>

  <p>"That's not an illusion," Sammy said with a smile. "I also have a feeling that they did the right thing."</p>

  <p>At these words, Fannie turned her head and stared at Sammy, something strange happening in her eyes. Exchanging glares now, both could see the peculiar look that had come over them - as if a layer of paper had been pierced. It was as if a man and a woman in secret love with each other had finally seen through to each other's thoughts?</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to go, too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, everyone else has gone already? No one is left here..."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you! Wait for me..."</p>

  <p>In the space created by the Teleportation Token, over three thousand members of the Demon Night were now floating around. The Demon Night members looked around curiously, but they couldn't figure out what kind of space they found themselves in. It was as if all the supreme worlds in this entire universe were condensed into this space.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to watch the beam of light. He chose not to close it, as if he was waiting for something.</p>

  <p>"Everyone has already entered," Amber softly mentioned to Luo Luo Zheng, as she floated beside him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. At that point, the white spinning light in front of him suddenly flashed, and a black figure floated out from the spinning light.</p>

  <p>Not far behind the first, another red figure also appeared. It was Fannie and Sammy!</p>

  <p>Many of the Demon Night world lords immediately raised their eyebrows, glaring at the two with hostility.</p>

  <p>"Are you still trying to court death?" A grand world lord stared coldly at Fannie and Sammy. After the recovery period, the life vitality within this grand world lord's body had mostly been restored. Although she wasn't in her peak condition, protecting herself from the two world lords was far from being a problem. Moreover, there were thousands of Demon Night members behind her.</p>

  <p>Sammy's brows furrowed and a trace of sternness appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing, Fannie pulled Sammy behind her and smiled amiably at the crowd. "I think? We should join you!"</p>

  <p>To the Demon Night members, this was an era that had witnessed the collapse of their belief.</p>

  <p>Yao's and Ying's unpopular decision had already dragged the Demon Night into the abyss. The entire Demon Night race was filled with internal contradictions, but not a single one of them had stepped up to take the lead for a change.</p>

  <p>If Xun didn't erase the Soul-sealing Needle, then she too would be controlled by it. Before long, she would join the actions of Yao and Ying.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng was acting on Xun's behalf in order to become the bellwether of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>When Murphy had originally created this race, he would have never expected something of the sort. He couldn't grasp the idea that a queen would be capable of escaping his control. Moreover, he hadn't thought that this queen would sacrifice tens of thousands of years, her great willpower and all of her memories in order to erase the Soul-sealing Needle!</p>

  <p>Everyone followed behind Luo Luo Zheng, as they all traveled through the space.</p>

  <p>This space had almost marked the entire Upper World of the universe. It was like a huge map and it was impossible not to feel like a tiny speck of nothingness.</p>

  <p>They were all very curious though. This emotion far outweighed the rest.</p>

  <p>They weren't aware of what this space was.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng selected a supreme world and opened a beam of blazing spinning light, right at the top of it. He was the first to enter!</p>

  <p>One by one, the Demon Night members followed Luo Luo Zheng into the blazing light. Upon seeing the world in front of them, their eyes were filled with disbelief. They finally understood that the space they had passed through had connected all the supreme worlds in the universe! Luo Luo Zheng could travel through the universe at will!</p>

  <p>"This... Is this the Purple Snow World?"</p>

  <p>"Is it really possible that we just passed through over nine hundred supreme worlds?!"</p>

  <p>"How did he even do it!?"</p>

  <p>In this universe, only a few people knew of the magic of Teleportation Token. Nathan, Lucille, and a few of the others were all very surprised when they had traveled through the Teleportation Token, for example.</p>

  <p>They were Godly Geniuses after all, and they were used to seeing all kinds of magical weapons.</p>

  <p>But the group of Demon Night members that had followed Luo Luo Zheng here were different. Their eyes were filled with disbelief instead, especially the grand world lords.</p>

  <p>Instantly crossing thousands of supreme worlds was only something that a Supreme Lord could achieve. Not just that, but even a Supreme Lord wouldn't be able to lead thousands of people in crossing such a long distance!</p>
