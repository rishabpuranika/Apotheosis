<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Alan Nian, the vice leader of the Dragon Blaze Hall, was a person of great power. His rank was next to the head and his competence was beyond everyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>An organization as powerful as Dragon Blaze Hall had arranged for a vice head to greet Zheng, so it was obvious that it took Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>Zack too was very excited. If he could get Zheng to join Dragon Blaze Hall, it would be a great achievement for him.</p>

  <p>"So, where is this young man who withstood the baptism by laws?" Alan asked Zack as he greeted him. He was very curious regarding this boy everyone was talking about.</p>

  <p>"Sir, he is being trained for the elite and refining his soul,"</p>

  <p>Zack answered with an uncalled urgency.</p>

  <p>"Then take me there," Alan said in a commanding tone. He looked quite composed but his eyes gleamed with flames.</p>

  <p>They started walking toward the training ground. Standing at the edge of it, Alan asked, "Which one is...what's his name...Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Zack pointed his finger toward a slim and handsome young man. Alan measured him up with his sharp eyes and just like Zack had informed him, he didn't find anything special about Zheng. He was just a juvenile at the young bone age and had just reached the consummation of the nature level. Alan was a little doubtful of his abilities.</p>

  <p>"Did he really activate the obelisk and go through a baptism by laws?"</p>

  <p>Alan asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I wouldn't dare joke about such a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm.. I'll talk to him after he finishes his practice," Alan said, nodding his head with a gentle smile on his face. Countless practitioners put immense effort to join Dragon Blaze Hall each year, given its immaculate reputation. It would be a piece of cake for Alan to compel this young man from the Lower World to join them.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, a black ball floating not very far away from him started to vibrate.</p>

  <p>A loud clash of several brittle sounds filled the air. The sounds reverberated in the atmosphere for some time, before the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock on the surface of the black ball finally cracked.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" Alan asked as the flames flashed in his dilated pupils. "Isn't the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock used to imprison the Owl Beast evil spirit? How could it crack like that?"</p>

  <p>Zack was too shocked to answer. He simply kept staring at the upheaval that was taking place in horror.</p>

  <p>The cracking continued as the practitioners who were practicing in the black ball drew their souls back.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Run!"</p>

  <p>Having drawn their souls, they ran straight out of the training ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing how scared they were, Zack rushed to the ground and stopped one of the practitioners. "What's going on?" he asked. "What happened to the ball?"</p>

  <p>"I... I don't know. That guy just rushed over to the Owl Beast evil spirit!</p>

  <p>And then the Thunder Lock broke, letting out the Owl Beast evil spirit!" the boy said, stammering with fear. The boy didn't know Zheng's name, but he was aware of him due to the fame he had gotten from breaking through the obstacles of different rings in the black ball. He was among the many practitioners who were very impressed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Which guy?" Alan asked the boy, having come to the scene rushing after Zack.</p>

  <p>"That one! He is still sitting there!" The boy pointed at Zheng, who sat in close vicinity.</p>

  <p>The Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock was on the verge of breaking down.</p>

  <p>No one dared to stay in the black ball for another second, scared that they'd be killed in no time. The Owl Beast evil spirit was capable of killing anyone in its way. All the practitioners including Christopher ran for their lives without a second thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng alone sat in the entirety of the ground, looking determined and striking.</p>

  <p>Alan frowned at him in disbelief. "He is just a nature creature! How can his soul be powerful enough to stand the Owl Beast evil spirit?" he asked in Zack's direction.</p>

  <p>"Of course it can! He entered the core from the outermost ring of the black ball within a month. The ball cracked the moment he approached that Owl Beast devil spirit!"</p>

  <p>The practitioner didn't know Alan and hence replied spontaneously.</p>

  <p>However, he guessed the man in front of him was a high rank leader, making him feel a little relieved, which was why he didn't run away like the others.</p>

  <p>"Sir, Zheng might have..." Zack started but then stopped in the middle of the sentence.</p>

  <p>Alan replied nonchalantly, "No matter how capable he is, he cannot survive in a fight against the Owl Beast evil spirit. Seems like I came here for nothing!" He stared at the black ball hovering in the air with a complex expression. If what the practitioner had said was right, and Zheng truly had walked into the internal ring within a month, he definitely deserved to be explored by Dragon Blaze Hall.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity! He is not lucky enough to join us!" Zack said regrettably.</p>

  <p>As they talked, several people appeared flying above the training ground.</p>

  <p>They couldn't have been ordinary people as it was forbidden to fly in this city.</p>

  <p>The man who led them was tall and sturdy, garbed in silver armor. Many dragon textures were engraved on his shoulders. He appeared like someone who was a born warrior!</p>

  <p>Alan recognized him as soon as he spot him and flew up in an instant, greeting him with his fingers crossed, "Hi, Dennis!"</p>

  <p>Dennis Tang was the lord of the city. His position was even higher than Alan in the Dragon Lineage Human race.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Alan! I didn't expect to see you here! What happened?" Dennis asked with his eyes stuck to the black ball in the training ground. It had costed him a lot of energy to catch the Owl Beast devil spirit. It was very hard to cope with a spirit which had Jasper Fighting soul. This was why they had arranged for a Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock after capturing it.</p>

  <p>The reason they had gone to so much trouble was to get the cultivators to practice by taking use of the Owl Beast devil spirit.</p>

  <p>Although it was an effective cultivation method, soul practicing couldn't be finished in a short time. Practitioners who were not particularly persistent didn't stick out. Custom was, if a cultivator stepped into the sixth ring, he could practice his soul to the Fighting Soul realm.</p>

  <p>However, there weren't many people who could achieve that.</p>

  <p>"I just got here. A practitioner told us the Thunder Lock broke down the moment this boy Zheng broke into the sixth ring," Alan said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?" It was Elder Wei who spoke from behind Dennis.</p>

  <p>Dennis looked back and asked, "Yes...what's wrong with him?" Dennis was unaware of Zheng, which was why he didn't give a loud reaction at the name. When Alan told him he had broken into the sixth ring, he thought Zheng was simply persistent and hence could reach the high level in soul cultivation, as many other practitioners before him had done the same in their time.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is the stowaway you pardoned. He has just reached the pinnacle of the nature level. In other words, his soul is still weak. He shouldn't be able to break into the sixth ring in such a state!"</p>

  <p>Elder Wei said in total surprise.</p>

  <p>Dennis was surprised too. "Oh, I remember that!"</p>

  <p>Some time ago, someone had presented Dennis with a paper of divine texture, with a sentence left by the cyan dragon on it, who was one of the forty-nine Genuine Dragons and called Josh!</p>

  <p>For Dennis and other big shots here, the Genuine Dragons were like gods! They had never had a chance of even spotting one from a distance.</p>

  <p>These dragons were extremely valued as even the Dragon Lineage Human masters relied on these powerful dragons!</p>

  <p>Years ago, nine of the forty-nine dragons had disappeared due to a mystical case they were involved in. Till date, nobody knew where they were or what had happened to them. Even people on levels as high as Dennis couldn't figure what had happened to the highest level members of the Genuine Dragon family. He didn't even need to know the detailed truth as long as he knew the nine dragons had disappeared.</p>

  <p>When he saw the divine texture paper with the cyan dragon's message, he was utterly surprised and couldn't contain his excitement. This meant he could finally get in touch with a bigwig like Josh! What a great stroke of luck! But when he read the dragon's words on the margin, he had been a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>Josh had written to Dennis that he had met Zheng by chance in his travels.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng wasn't a member of their family, if he flew up through the Dragon Soar Arena, Dennis could take him as a member of the Dragon Lineage Human race along. Josh had also warned Dennis not to reveal this news to anyone, or his life would be in danger.</p>

  <p>Dennis wondered how the nine dragons had disappeared so mysteriously.</p>

  <p>There had to be a shocking conspiracy behind it!</p>

  <p>The warning had scared Dennis. He knew if he got involved in this fight, he could die without even knowing the cause of it.</p>

  <p>Dennis hadn't told anyone about the issue until now and hadn't even asked the name of that stowaway.</p>

  <p>He wasn't really a coward. One would expect someone in the position of the city lord to be courageous and able. But even the masters of the Dragon Lineage Human race wouldn't like to be involved in this sort of a fight, let alone a city lord like him.</p>

  <p>He was surprised the person who had caused the trouble of the day was no one else but the stowaway he had pardoned.</p>

  <p>"Wei, is Zheng the Lower World practitioner who experienced the baptism by laws?"</p>

  <p>A woman wearing a red palace dress appeared from behind Wei and asked him. Her face radiated with beauty and charm. The most impressive thing about her was the blood-red mole in the middle of her brows, that almost made her look coquettish.</p>

  <p>Flames flashed in Alan's eyes as they landed upon her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>Smiling lightly, he bowed and said. "Madame, I didn't expect to see you here!"</p>

  <p>This woman was no one but the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace.</p>

  <p>The woman didn't answer Alan and descended toward the black ball. The Dragon Abyss Palace and the Dragon Blaze Hall didn't get along too well.</p>
