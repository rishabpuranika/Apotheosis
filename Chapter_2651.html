<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2651 Joint Attack From Brother And Sister </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the fragments of the flying knives scattered in all directions, Emily took a few steps back as her eyes stared blankly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She always had a feeling that Zheng had special methods she didn't know about.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to kill the exiles sent by Spark so easily.</p>

  <p>But what Emily didn't expect was that Zheng could break the restrictions of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy!</p>

  <p>The green energy was not very powerful but when Emily took a quick glance at it, she immediately felt that it was indeed quite mysterious.</p>

  <p>She really had a hard time seeing through him.</p>

  <p>After a short pause, she saw that Bonnie was rushing down. She lightly tapped her toe as she prepared herself to jump down from the roof. She didn't want to let Bonnie mess up the situation.</p>

  <p>But just as Emily jumped up, a blue long whip immediately came after her!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The long whip was very sharp. Its slash created a deep cut on the roof and immediately rushed towards Emily.</p>

  <p>She frowned as she saw it coming.</p>

  <p>Of course, she was unable to use her mortal body to withstand the impact. All she could do was to abruptly twist and stay put on the roof.</p>

  <p>"I am your opponent. Ha-ha!" another man in a black robe with a blue long whip in his hand blocked Emily's way.</p>

  <p>Zheng's speed at brandishing his sword became faster and faster as he struck his targets more precisely every time.</p>

  <p>Although Arvin summoned a lot of butterflies in a ridiculous manner, it was all in vain. As soon as the butterflies were condensed, they were immediately destroyed by the tip of Zheng's sword. His precision with every strike was truly astonishing.</p>

  <p>It was as if his sword was a part of his hand. He used it with finesse and he could do whatever he wanted with it.</p>

  <p>'What an amazing display of swordsmanship! How could someone like you exist?'</p>

  <p>Arvin thought to himself.</p>

  <p>In his opinion, there were only a few leaders from the exiles that he shouldn't mess and those were Timotheus and Emily and the like.</p>

  <p>They were very powerful but they were nothing under the influence of Strength Equalizing Theurgy. On the other hand, they knew they were destined to stop the intruders with all that they had. After all, they were lucky enough to receive the grace of their master.</p>

  <p>But now a brat suddenly popped out, and no one understood what kind of method he used to surpass the restrictions of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy. They didn't know what in the hell was going on.</p>

  <p>Arvin had a lot of questions running through his head but he didn't have the chance to ask. All he wanted was to survive!</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was getting closer and closer to him, he couldn't think of a better way to stop him.</p>

  <p>The brat's sword was like a black hole that violently sucked him. He couldn't get rid of it no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was finally in front of Arvin. He then raised his sword to strike. As he struck with his sword, the emerald green sword radiance appeared.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was so close to Arvin that there was no way for him to avoid his strike. Arvin's heart sank as he realized that he was about to lose his precious life. As he waited for his inevitable death with his eyes closed-Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, three whistling sounds echoed through his ears.</p>

  <p>Three blue flying knives flew past his head and ears and went straight for Zheng!</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't willing to let go of his opportunity to kill Arvin.</p>

  <p>He saw the three flying knives coming towards him but he didn't want to give in.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>Zheng slashed across the flying knives with his long sword. After he broke the first flying knife, the long sword immediately went for Arvin's head.</p>

  <p>But the other two flying knives cracked at that moment and countless tiny blue fragments scattered all over the place.</p>

  <p>If Zheng didn't dodge, he would have been severely injured by the densely packed fragments!</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng had no other choice but to draw back his sword and step back to prevent the fragments from hurting him.</p>

  <p>Arvin was finally able to get out of Zheng's hot pursuit. With a bit of luck, he managed to escape his death.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Arvin was very exhausted, his heart beating fast as he gasped for air.</p>

  <p>"Arvin, are you feeling alright?"</p>

  <p>Bonnie came up to Arvin and stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"I'm alright. If it wasn't for your help, I would have been dead by now," said Arvin. He was ecstatic that he had a narrow escape from death.</p>

  <p>"What happened to him? The green energy on his sword... Where is it coming from?" Bonnie looked at Zheng who wasn't very far from them and her eyes were immediately filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>Her brother's "Trapping Butterflies" and her "Cracking Knives" were both graces from their master. Only with these graces could they be qualified to ignore the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>The young man in front of them was extremely unfamiliar, and she thought maybe he wasn't well known in the bone towers. How could he have the ability to ignore the restrictions of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy?</p>

  <p>"I am not sure either. Maybe there is something wrong with the Strength Equalizing Theurgy..." Arvin didn't believe what came out of his own mouth.</p>

  <p>The Strength Equalizing Theurgy was given by the master, someone who was undoubtedly extremely powerful. It was impossible for the master to commit such silly mistakes.</p>

  <p>"None of it matters, we just need to kill him together!" A murderous look appeared in Bonnie's eyes.</p>

  <p>The Warden race was starting to gain an advantage in the fierce battle between the two parties. The other party had lost more Wild Gods and exiles than the Warden race.</p>

  <p>But what they had to solve as soon as possible were the elites among the intruders.</p>

  <p>At first, Bonnie decided that Emily was her target. However, when she saw that her brother was in danger, she had to focus on the young man who was standing right in front of her.</p>

  <p>Zheng placed his long sword horizontally on his chest. When he heard the conversation between the two, a faint light appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Endless cries and screams echoed through their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Some of the Wild Gods and exiles were still being murdered by the Warden race...</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was not familiar with those people, they were his comrades and they had fought with him throughout their way. He also knew that he had to finish his battle as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Bonnie shouted as she sent blue flying knives towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, countless butterflies flew out of Arvin's hand. As they fluttered in the air, they immediately followed the path left by the flying knives.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng saw the joint attack from the brother and sister, he immediately moved his feet slightly to sweep his body to the side like a ghost. After circling around them, he found an opening and rushed towards his two opponents.</p>

  <p>Arvin and Bonnie executed their attacks perfectly. The two of them unhurriedly kept a proper distance from each other and at the same time, they also formed a two-pronged attack.</p>

  <p>If Zheng rushed towards Arvin, he would be vulnerable to an attack from Bonnie. If he rushed towards Bonnie, he would be vulnerable to an attack from Arvin.</p>

  <p>As they came closer and closer, the two were able to surround Zheng!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>He then brandished his long sword as rays of green light formed a protective shield around him. When he saw that he was surrounded by Bonnie and Arvin, he couldn't think of any way to escape.</p>

  <p>Bonnie waved his arms constantly to bombard Zheng with more flying knives. She glanced up and said with a smile, "Bergen, your timing is perfect! Help us kill this brat right now!"</p>

  <p>The battle between Zheng and the two siblings was starting to attract other people's attention.</p>

  <p>After all, both Bonnie and Arvin were the core figures of the Warden race. But now Bergen was about to join the fight. He knew he had to help them.</p>

  <p>The Warden members couldn't believe what they were seeing! Even Emily didn't deserve them sending so many people to deal with her after the Strength Equalizing Theurgy was activated. Where did this talented swordsman come from?</p>

  <p>A lot of the warriors who were busy fighting stopped at that moment to see who Zheng was.</p>
