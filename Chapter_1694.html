<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Lawson shouldn't have attacked Luo Luo Zheng with brute force. It seems that he has fulfilled Luo Zheng's wish? he was killed in a single punch. If that's not the case, it's likely that the outcome will be difficult to determine," Preston commented from beside Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Smiling, she didn't refute his words. All she needed to do was believe in Luo Luo Zheng? that was enough.</p>

  <p>No one from the Lie Clan had expected such an outcome.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment."</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that Lawson's first battle among the top ten warriors would end up like this?</p>

  <p>Lawson was the Lie Clan's hope.</p>

  <p>It had invested numerous and priceless resources into Lawson for dozens of years, all to create the perfect warrior.</p>

  <p>Every bone in his body and every inch of his flesh were in perfect condition. Apart from his arrogant and unstable personality, Lawson was undoubtedly the strongest talent nurtured by the Lie Clan.</p>

  <p>Even Nathan hadn't received as many resources from his clan.</p>

  <p>But Lawson was smashed into dust by a single punch from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His blow didn't seem to land on Lawson's body, but instead the faces of all the Lie Clan members.</p>

  <p>Such a failure was an unacceptable disgrace for them.</p>

  <p>"Lawson can't be that weak!"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to accept this. I'm going to challenge Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it. He's so crafty. How could Luo Luo Zheng use such a trick?"</p>

  <p>After a long period of silence, everyone in the clan began boiling up with frustration. Countless warriors were filled with indignation and couldn't restrain their emotions. Their voices were like boiling oil as they began shouting out loud.</p>

  <p>"All of you shut up!" roared the Lie Clan's head.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the whole place once again fell into a heavy silence.</p>

  <p>The patriarchs of the four great clans were all Supreme Lords, but the heads of the four clans still held the most power in their respective groups.</p>

  <p>"My son was reckless. He didn't take Luo Luo Zheng seriously enough. That's why he suffered such a loss. Now stop blaming his opponent," the head said coldly. "I hope this battle will teach him a lesson. At the very least, he still has a chance."</p>

  <p>In the sky within the picture, a stone slowly appeared. On it, a small light condensed until Lawson appeared.</p>

  <p>Lawson's eyes grew empty? he seemed to have fallen into a daze.</p>

  <p>Clearly, he hadn't yet come back to his senses.</p>

  <p>Defeated in a single blow?</p>

  <p>If someone told him this before the battle, he would have thought that this was the biggest joke he had ever heard in his life.</p>

  <p>In truth, if it weren't for Luo Luo Zheng using Lawson's and his own strength to counterattack, he wouldn't have managed to kill him. At most, he probably could have only injured him severely.</p>

  <p>But the severely injured Lawson could fully recover in almost half a minute. His regenerative abilities were much better than that of any ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>Not to mention, his cultivation of the Divine Dao was a special one.</p>

  <p>But none of them mattered any longer.</p>

  <p>While Lawson grew cold and depressed with the thought, his gaze landed on Nathan.</p>

  <p>A faint smile hung on the latter's face.</p>

  <p>"What are you grinning about?" Lawson asked in anger.</p>

  <p>"Serves you right." Nathan revealed his teeth. While he was very much willing to let anyone teach Lawson a lesson, he couldn't deny that he was irked that it was Luo Luo Zheng who did it. It was impossible for Nathan himself to kill Lawson in a single punch.</p>

  <p>Although it was clear that Luo Zheng's victory had some element of luck, he still managed to defeat Lawson in a single punch.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't know how to rationalize it.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Lawson groaned, muffled. Without saying a word, he lost himself deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Even though he was considered a madman, he wasn't an idiot. This indeed brought great shame and humiliation to him. But he was determined to not let himself be finished for good? he still had a chance.</p>

  <p>If he lost his confidence after a single blow, he would have truly failed.</p>

  <p>To become a Godly Genius, one needed their own unique state of mind.</p>

  <p>Although Lawson was crazy, persistent, and arrogant, he knew how to repent and mend his ways.</p>

  <p>Lucille was someone who never gave up? she gracefully accepted defeat and used the failure to push her to work harder.</p>

  <p>Pursuing absolute justice was Karl, unable to take anything unfairly.</p>

  <p>As for Nathan, he had absolute confidence in himself. This was his warrior spirit, and it couldn't be broken.</p>

  <p>While defeating these Godly Geniuses wasn't necessarily always difficult, it was nearly impossible to crush their warrior spirits. These were the top talents that the clans had invested numerous resources in? they were all brimming with skills.</p>

  <p>The next battle was between Shania and Karl.</p>

  <p>Since she had displayed a strength that far surpassed her peers', defeating even Lucille, almost everyone was feeling optimistic about her.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had been flourishing all these years.</p>

  <p>In terms of the number of Supreme Lords, the race could already stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>But the warriors still didn't expect the poor performance of the Celestial Position warriors in the Illusion Battlefield. One of their two Godly Geniuses had already been eliminated, leaving behind a mind-boggling Karl.</p>

  <p>It was indeed rather unreasonable that only one warrior of the Celestial Position race had entered the top ten.</p>

  <p>In some warriors' minds, Karl was slightly weaker than Lucille.</p>

  <p>No one was expecting any suspense in the battle.</p>

  <p>Of the other nine warriors, apart from Nathan, there weren't many with the ability to restrain Shania.</p>

  <p>But the result went beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, Karl was completely suppressed by Shania.</p>

  <p>Using the Immortal-trapping Vine to wrap around his body, she prevented him from moving.</p>

  <p>This vine acted like a giant python, coiling tightly around Karl. As it grew, thorns grew along with it, heading straight for him.</p>

  <p>But there was no trace of panic on Karl's righteous face.</p>

  <p>A light golden holy shield acted like an eggshell as it enveloped Karl's body, wrapping him tightly within.</p>

  <p>Condensed from his faith, the shield's defensive power was incomparably overbearing.</p>

  <p>This stalemate lasted quite a while before Shania realized that she couldn't finish off her opponent with the Immortal-trapping Vine. With a wave of her hand, another plant grew rapidly and bloomed into a black flower cage.</p>

  <p>The Bone-devouring Flower Cage, it was called, filled with bone-devouring water that could melt anything.</p>

  <p>This was a kind of plant that made people's faces change.</p>

  <p>But even as Karl was thrown into it, his shield remained intact.</p>

  <p>Finally, Shania had met her most challenging obstacle.</p>

  <p>This guy from the Celestial Position race looked like a complete fool, but his defense was undeniably terrifying. The pale golden holy shield was practically unbreakable.</p>

  <p>After the five-minute stalemate, even if Shania went through several methods, it was still nearly impossible to break through Karl's defense.</p>

  <p>Only when she summoned a large number of Heart Eating Insects did she finally break it.</p>

  <p>With this, Shania from the Demon Night race had claimed victory.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, she was just like Luo Luo Zheng? they had both defeated two Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the rest of the Godly Geniuses would encounter Shania sooner or later, they remained standing on their stones, pondering over how to deal with her.</p>

  <p>But within the Heaven Earth Board, there was no way to obtain the guidance of their seniors. The countermeasure to Shania's Heart Eating Insects was still unknown.</p>

  <p>While the others might not have their seniors' guidance, Lone was a special case. The broken sword in his hand told him how to deal with the insects, and he nodded slightly upon hearing that.</p>

  <p>The battle on the Heaven Earth Board continued.</p>

  <p>Next, it was Nathan against Lone.</p>

  <p>Lone had Lost to Luo Luo Zheng once before. Before his second battle, he managed to regain his confidence, vowing to defeat his next opponent. But when he discovered that Nathan was his opponent, his face darkened.</p>

  <p>He had once lost to Nathan, after all.</p>

  <p>This left him no confidence to go against the man again.</p>

  <p>The broken sword in his hand was indeed the most important thing he could rely on, but it was already extremely damaged. Before entering the Illusion Battlefield, Lone had taken it to numerous people, finding a way to repair it, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Facing Nathan, he barely managed to endure a few rounds before taking it upon himself to admit defeat. As for the former, he didn't bother making things any more difficult on Lone.</p>

  <p>Then, it was Luo Zheng's turn for the next battle.</p>

  <p>But just as he stood on the board, he realized that Mu Ning was his opponent.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that he would have to fight Mu Ning sooner or later, he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable facing her in battle.</p>

  <p>But a faint smile lingered on Xi Youqin's face. Placing her hands behind her back, she walked slowly toward Luo Luo Zheng as graceful of a ballerina, with a charming smile on her face. It didn't seem like they were in a battle at all.</p>

  <p>Walking right up to him, she raised her head and asked in a sweet voice,</p>

  <p>"What reward will you give me if I win?"</p>
