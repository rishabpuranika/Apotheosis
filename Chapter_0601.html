<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 601 A Secret Left Untold (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Kenneth gave it his best shot to exert the fist. At that moment, his face was overcast, and his eyes were wide open?he was extremely angry. But even if he was furious, he had precise control over the strength of the fist. Luo Luo Zheng was only a few feet away from Lady Long, but the damage was only limited to Lady Long's location, and Luo Luo Zheng was not hurt at all.</p>

  <p>"Bitch! How dare you bully my disciple? Do you not know my presence in here?" Kenneth roared at Lady Long.</p>

  <p>"You! How dare you threaten me? Do you think I'd be afraid of you?"</p>

  <p>Lady Long waved her stick, ready to hit Kenneth. She felt frightened and angry at the same time. The power of the fist was quite strong that if she hadn't dodged it in time, she would have been injured and possibly have been dead.</p>

  <p>"Then bring it on!" Kenneth clenched his fists and stood straight with a sneer on his face.</p>

  <p>"Calm down, everyone!" Fernandez stepped in and stood firmly between them. "Lady Long, don't be absurd," he said coldly to the woman, "If you continue to make trouble, I'm afraid that I have to teach you a lesson myself!"</p>

  <p>Amongst them, Fernandez was an elder. Compared to others, he had higher status and greater strength that even the likes Lady Long and Kenneth could not match.</p>

  <p>Looking at Lady Long's vexatious behavior, he eventually ran out of patience.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was only a junior who had just gone through a series of tests along the Cloud Road, but Lady Long treated him so mean. Fernandez couldn't stand her cruelty towards the young Luo Luo Zheng. Furthermore, he thought very highly of Luo Luo Zheng and favored the promising young man. Wherever he could be, he would always be outstanding. If ever he would come to Cloud Hall, he would surely be the hope of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Elder Fernandez, I?" Lady Long tried to argue. But seeing the looks on Fernandez's face, she didn't dare to argue.</p>

  <p>"That's enough of your nonsense, Floret Long. You shut up and stay there. Don't let me say it again!" His tone of voice held an unmistakable threat. There was no doubt that he would teach her a lesson if she continued to talk rubbish.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng burst into a snigger when he heard Fernandez call Lady Long's name? Floret.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect such an old woman to have such a fancy name.</p>

  <p>Looking at Lady Long's long and darkened face, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't compare her with a flower even when she was young. Luo Luo Zheng knew it was immoral to make fun of other people's names, so he tried to stifle a smile but failed.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the only one. Several leaders also couldn't help laughing when they heard Fernandez call her by the name "Floret". As for the old man from the Auspice Sect, he also smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Lady Long who had a well-developed instinct for anger got furious. She considered it so humiliating to be laughed at by a junior. She looked like she was about to explode, and her wrinkles became more visible. Her anger was about to simmer over.</p>

  <p>But Fernandez was standing right in front of her now and he had just warned her, so she didn't dare to take any action.</p>

  <p>Then Fernandez turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said in all seriousness, "Luo Luo Zheng, I know you, Frank, and the other six disciples have taken the Death Road. Why haven't I seen them come out yet?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Fernandez's inquiry, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "We have met some troubles in the Death Road and I fell into an abyss. But they have gone out of the Death Road safe and sound. I guess they should still be on the Cloud Road by now. Don't worry, I figure they will soon come out."</p>

  <p>The exit of the Death Road was right above that abyss. For Frank's group, they were all with powerful strength. If they passed the Death Road, the succeeding tests in the Cloud Road should not be too difficult for them.</p>

  <p>Fernandez felt relieved to hear that the other disciples had also passed the Death Road. The long livid face of Lady Long finally relaxed.</p>

  <p>Although there were still many dangers in the Cloud Road, given the disciples' strength, they should be able to cope with them.</p>

  <p>"You just said that you had fallen into an abyss, then how did you get through the Cloud Road so fast?" Fernandez found it strange and asked.</p>

  <p>The other several leaders were also puzzled. It didn't make any sense that Luo Luo Zheng could come out in such a short time. Did he find any shortcut in the abyss?</p>

  <p>"Can I keep it as a secret?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to tell me, I will respect your decision. You may leave the secret untold," Fernandez smiled.</p>

  <p>The other leaders also wanted to know whether there was a shortcut in the Cloud Road. If there was such a shortcut, then they could inform the next disciples who would take part in the next trial in another three years.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Luo Zheng had refused to tell them the truth, they couldn't force him to. They all had the same idea that they shall ask him about it in the future. In their view, Luo Luo Zheng was sure to become a disciple of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Once he was in Cloud Hall, they would have plenty of opportunities to inquire about the said shortcut.</p>

  <p>Instead of waiting at the arch with the leaders, Luo Luo Zheng then walked away. He sat on a small space and began to meditate.</p>

  <p>Within two hours, the cyclone under the arch began to whirl again, and then Tianming came out of it.</p>

  <p>The moment when Tianming appeared, the first person he saw was not Fernandez nor the other leaders. It was Luo Luo Zheng who was meditating not far away. He froze as soon as he saw him.</p>
