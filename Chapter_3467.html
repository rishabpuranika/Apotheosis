  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Has this black crystal shield been restored?"</p>

  <p>Shock was written all over Luo Zheng's face, but it was soon replaced with ecstasy.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was different from the other thirteen Truths of Divine Dao. Not only could it create things, but also restore things to their original forms. Now, it was totally a coincidence for Luo Zheng to have poured the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. He never expected for it to work to this extent.</p>

  <p>There were a few continuous sputters as more and more cracks appeared on the surface of the black crystal shield.</p>

  <p>Eventually, it was completely restored to black energy.</p>

  <p>Then, a white spot appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he slashed at the white spot with his sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the whole world tremble as the sword touched the white spot. The ground near him shook for a while before a big crack appeared, from which the Evil God's real body was ejected out. He feebly lay on the ground as he could not move.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng observed the Evil God, then walked towards him with the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand. "Everything is really over now," he stated.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked aghast upon hearing Luo Zheng's words. The truth was punishing him in his inner world since he began to burn the world. There was no reason for him to feel good.</p>

  <p>Even then, he still had the audacity to smile. "You think that killing me is enough to stop the destruction of the world, but in fact nobody can stop it now. I can't, and you can't either. Hahaha..." he said lazily.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Luo Zheng's face twisted in fury at what the Evil God said. He quickly decided to consult the Green Jade Spirit in his mind and asked, "Is it true that the world cannot stop from burning?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the Green Jade Spirit. "To be honest, a Civilization Artifact is different from all the other kinds of Other Shore Tokens. If I don't allow you to burn it, you can't burn the Civilization Artifact. As for me, I can stop the Green Jade World from burning."</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact in the Evil God's body also represented a civilization, and there must be a leader of such a civilization, like the Green Jade Spirit. The Green Jade Spirit, however, just couldn't understand how the Evil God had successfully persuaded that leader to burn their Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"So it seems like there is no solution..." Luo Zheng's face darkened for a moment.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit fell silent as well. It was indeed a difficult problem to solve.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God saw Luo Zheng's grim face, he slightly perked up. "Take me back. I still have a lot of secrets, many valuable secrets. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use them, because you will die here with me," he sneered.</p>

  <p>Just then, the strangely-colored world suddenly trembled once more.</p>

  <p>The huge black snakes that had been forming black meteorites suddenly disappeared, together with the meteorites and the energy tide that was surging everywhere on the ground.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Evil God couldn't help but be dumbfounded when he felt the changes around him. "No, no, you can't stop! Never stop!</p>

  <p>I'm your master! You can't betray me!" the Evil God roared with all his strength.</p>

  <p>Yet, no matter how loudly he howled, he couldn't do anything to prevent the energy from disappearing.</p>

  <p>After a little while, even the strangely-colored world that the Evil God had summoned had vanished as well.</p>

  <p>The members from various races, who were desperately running for their lives just now, also stopped in their tracks due to utter surprise. The world had been on the brink of destruction a while ago, but now it was suddenly calm and serene. Only the gentle but sharp cyan light that emitted from the Green Jade World had remained.</p>

  <p>"Has the whole world been burnt out?"</p>

  <p>"It seems not... If the whole world was burned, then we wouldn't have survived!"</p>

  <p>"Surely, the burning must've stopped!"</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he did not know what happened, but according to the Evil God's reaction, he could guess why.</p>

  <p>Just like him, the Evil God also had a Civilization Artifact. The difference was that the Evil God seemed to have had complete control over his Civilization Artifact. So, maybe there was no civilization leader like the Green Jade Spirit, or such a leader was still asleep.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God began to burn the whole world, the leader had finally awoken and took action to stop the fiery catastrophe.</p>

  <p>The specific details might be more or less different from Luo Zheng's theory, but the overall process should be the same as he guessed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Evil God still cried out in desperation, and he clearly looked like he was unwilling to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>For him, the current situation was worse than death.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God lamented miserably, Luo Zheng went towards him and lifted him up, then tried to absorb him into his own inner world.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, Luo Zheng still had to ask one's consent in advance if he were to absorb them in his inner world. The Evil God, however, was originally a creature that came out from his inner world. Thus, he didn't need to consider the Evil God's feelings or permission when he wanted to absorb him back.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng's inner world had completely absorbed the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God fell from the high sky in Luo Zheng's inner world. Before he could reach the ground, numerous golden ropes appeared strangely out of nowhere and bound him tightly.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's inner world, there was no room for the Evil God to revolt.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he was unable to do such a thing when he was in such a bad state.</p>

  <p>The Evil God simply stared blankly into the horizon. His expression didn't change even when he saw the unfolded Civilization Artifact. He knew clearly that his day had gone, and all his plans and ambitions had vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had finally defeated the Evil God, his gaze swept over his surroundings. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that Yan, Ling Shuang, Feng Ge, Sally and their other companions were all safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Some of the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race from the Li Shan mountain had been injured or even killed, but such casualties were inevitable in a battle. This was already the best result.</p>

  <p>The other super forces and races suffered even worse losses.</p>

  <p>Still standing on the edge of the Green Jade World, Fuxi finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Even Mount couldn't help but smile slightly. He was glad to see the Evil God die. At the same time, however, he realized that Luo Zheng would probably be his greatest opponent in the future.</p>

  <p>More than half of the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits split open, and she motionlessly lay on the ground.</p>

  <p>Densely packed Chaotic Source Spirits could be found at the side.</p>

  <p>Once the crisis was over, everyone's eyes were focused on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Some nonhuman creatures began to eye her with greedy looks again.</p>

  <p>Still, no one dared to take action.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's strangely-colored world had disappeared, but the Green Jade World still existed. Lastly, Luo Zheng still had a crystallized body.</p>

  <p>Even the immensely powerful Evil God was defeated because of Luo Zheng, so none of the people present dared to provoke him. Anyone who attempted to grab the Chaotic Source Spirits recklessly would be courting death.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The wings behind Luo Zheng's back flapped gently, then he flew towards the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"Brother ..." His sister Yan flew up as well to meet him. She caressed her brother's crystallized face and asked, "What happened to your eye..."</p>

  <p>One of Luo Zheng's eyes was lost, and half of his face was broken. He did look terrible, indeed.</p>

  <p>"My eye? Nothing!" Luo Zheng said with a small smile. There were bits of crystal that had congealed on his face. The Green Jade Crystals immediately replaced the cracks on his skin, so his face was quickly restored to its original state. The crystals didn't belong to his body in the first place, so he was fine.</p>

  <p>But since the Eye of Will had been burned, he had lost a very useful Other Shore Token. Without the Eye of Will, his Sword Texture Technique would be less powerful as well. Naturally, he needed something to replace it.</p>
