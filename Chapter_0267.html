<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Erm, well… That is…" stammered Saint Zara only to be cut off again as he stumbled over his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You were only considering that the man who was slain was part of the Zhuge family, a noble clan and that Luo Zheng isn't a noble citizen, but instead he's a nobody. If Luo Zheng had been killed by Fren that day, would you have cared at all?" asked Mu Ning, the disgust she felt was heard in her authoritative pitch. There was an imperial air in her manner, and such a noble air could only have been inherited from her father, the king of all of the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Although Saint Zara remained silent, it was Saint Viana, who stood beside him, and in a clear voice spoke, "Your Highness, as the owner of the Commandment Hall, Murry's an upright, scrupulous man and highly respected. When weighed against what Luo Zheng said, his words were more credible. If your highness were present, I think you would have believed Murry, over a statement from a murderer."</p>

  <p>Saint Viana shrewdly defended the decision the court had made earlier.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng was definitely the murderer. Murry's words were more persuasive. It was impossible for the saints to side with Luo Zheng over Murry.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stared at Saint Viana up and down, which embarrassed Saint Zara a little. After a moment of awkward silence, Mu Ning announced, "If that's the case, why didn't you wait for me before starting the court trial? I have evidence that shows Zheng's innocence."</p>

  <p>"You have evidence?" questioned Saint Zara with a surprised look on his face.</p>

  <p>Saint Viana laughed as he commented, "Your Highness, you can't be serious. I was present the day that Luo Zheng committed this heinous crime.</p>

  <p>How could there be evidence that I am unaware of?"</p>

  <p>"Of course there could be proof that you don't know about! Why would I show you any evidence I have? Just think for a moment, if there were no evidence of Zheng's innocence, why would I request a court trial?" asked Mu Ning, looking down from her lofty position.</p>

  <p>After finishing her rationale, Mu Ning clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>The men who had brought the chair rushed in from outside the Commandant Hall.</p>

  <p>Now, what they were carrying was not a chair, but a Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Carefully, the men set the Picture Slab on the floor beside Mu Ning before once more retreating into the background.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning gracefully extended her hand, flexing one finger at the Picture Slab while her remaining fingers remained slightly curled, reminding onlookers of an orchid.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the attention of those present was on the forms gradually coming into focus on the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Looking around the room, Mu Ning noticed everyone's faces paled at the sight of what was coming into view.</p>

  <p>No one expected Mu Ning to produce a Picture Slab with the events of that day recorded on it.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was shocked. He couldn't believe what had occurred that day reappeared on the Picture Slab before him.</p>

  <p>It also made Luo Zheng wonder why Master Su would have recorded what unfolded that day on a Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Doubtful as he was earlier that justice would prevail, Luo Zheng knew the truth would be exposed, and the saints would have to declare him innocent.</p>

  <p>As the scene on the Picture Slab unfolded, it was as though the saints present were slapped in the face, the sting of humility lashing their cheeks like whips.</p>

  <p>Pictures speak louder than words, so the saying went.</p>

  <p>"Do you have anything to add, saints?" asked Mu Ning while she slowly stretched her slender legs in the spacious chair, as if she were restraining herself from aggression and opting instead a more relaxed, even bored manner.</p>

  <p>"Erm…" Saint Zara was at a complete loss for words now, and he shot a resentful glance at Saint Viana, blaming him for this turn of events.</p>

  <p>After all, it had been Saint Viana who told him it would be all right to find Luo Zheng guilty and sentence him to death. He had even added that they didn't need to report anything to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>In fact, when they made their decision, Mu Ning wasn't even a consideration.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected Mu Ning to show up and defend Luo Zheng so fiercely at such pivotal moment.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, they'd forgotten. Mu Ning was the supreme noble princess who was once regarded as the precious pearl of the empire and had the confidence and drive to attain anything she wanted.</p>

  <p>It was only the incidents that took place in the palace years ago that depressed her and drove her to her decision to hide away, keeping a low profile as a tutor at the Cloud Sect later.</p>

  <p>Today's demonstration though reminded everyone that Mu Ning would always be Mu Ning. Despite having some issues with the Burning Sky Palace, she was the royal princess of the Burning Sky Empire, and no one could deny it.</p>

  <p>"Saint Zara, don't you think you owe me an explanation?" Since no one had spoken up, Mu Ning broke the silence and directed her question at Saint Zara, the primary judge of today's trial.</p>

  <p>As much as Saint Zara inwardly blamed Saint Viana, it was unrealistic to hope Saint Viana would step up and shoulder the blame which left him no option but lower his head as he said, "I am sorry, it was my negligence that led to the rash decision today. I beg your pardon, your royal highness."</p>

  <p>"I can certainly forgive you. I wonder though whether or not Luo Zheng will forgive you. If I didn't arrive when I did today, he would be dead in the Commandment Hall by now. You should ask Luo Zheng," commanded Mu Ning coldly.</p>

  <p>It was clear that Mu Ning intended to force Saint Zara to apologize to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a mere outer disciple at the Cloud Sect. It was utterly beyond anyone's understanding why Mu Ning would require a noble saint to apologize to him.</p>

  <p>As Aura's words sank in, Saint Zara and all the other saints' faces darkened.</p>
