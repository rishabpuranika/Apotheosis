<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4163 The Burial Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Divine Bell City saw that the big bell was broken, they were all stunned.</p>

  <p>They started thinking about who could have done it. It was such an important item for the whole city.</p>

  <p>The warriors fell silent, in disbelief of what just happened.</p>

  <p>Hallet was the first to speak. "It wasn't me! I didn't ring the bell!" he yelled with sincerity in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew how significant the big bell was to all the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Thus, he didn't want to be blamed for breaking it.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry. I saw it. I don't want to sound mean, but you don't have the ability to do that either," Augustus said.</p>

  <p>"If no one deliberately destroyed it, then why did it break?"</p>

  <p>"What does this mean? Will our cultivation road be cut off?"</p>

  <p>"I still want to advance to the upper floors!"</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore Realm warriors realized what the consequences of this event entailed, they all went crazy.</p>

  <p>Bromley immediately stepped forward and inspected the bell with a serious look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Back when Augustus entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he already discovered that something was wrong with it. Then, after he got out, they found out that the big bell was destroyed. It could mean that the Mysterious Yellow Tower was most likely in danger.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it."</p>

  <p>A nonhuman creature at the Other Shore Realm walked towards the bell and also inspected it.</p>

  <p>He was from one of the large races in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Not only the human race but also other races would definitely be affected by what happened to the big bell. So, all of them expressed concern and thought of a way to fix it.</p>

  <p>The creature stood in front of the bell with his hands hanging down and head raised. This was his way of cultivation.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>A burst of green light suddenly came out above his head. As he recited the Truth of Divine Dao silently, he slammed his hands on the big bell.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The bell made a deafening sound that reverberated throughout the city.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The green light on the head of the creature began to dim. When it completely dissipated, he shook his head and said, "It's no use. I couldn't enter."</p>

  <p>"Then, it's really broken?"</p>

  <p>"Is there no way to fix it?"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?!"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors couldn't help but complain loudly.</p>

  <p>After the creature attempted to enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower through the broken bell, several others also rushed and tried, but they too failed.</p>

  <p>Even so, the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard refused to give up.</p>

  <p>Several races began to gather human masters to try and find a way to repair the bell.</p>

  <p>They did the simplest and most direct method. The human race formed a group of skilled craftsmen from the divine land to straighten the edge of the bell and carefully fill the gap with metal.</p>

  <p>After working for three whole days and nights, they managed to return the bell to its original state. Then, they tried ringing it again.</p>

  <p>To make sure that the bell wasn't going to break again, they made a cultivator at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm do it.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The bell seemed to have been repaired physically, but it didn't make the same sound as before. Furthermore, the cultivator who rang the bell still couldn't enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>At that moment, that was when all their hopes began shattering. They realized that they couldn't repair it anymore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the Heavenly Square City in the Jade Pure Realm, the Snake Spirit King was having a conversation with the black light.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's long tail extended in front of him, and the black light that was embedded in his tail constantly flickered.</p>

  <p>"So why didn't you even let him finish what he was saying?" the Snake Spirit King asked in a nonchalant tone.</p>

  <p>"Why would I? His words were meaningless," the black light responded.</p>

  <p>Its voice came from within the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Then, is the secondary world really irreversible?" the Snake Spirit King asked again, trying to confirm what he heard.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I already show you? You would rather believe the words of a mere human?" The black light returned the question.</p>

  <p>"If it is reversible, then why do we have to wait for so long? More than a thousand chaotic eras have already passed. Even if we calculate that time with the method in main world, it is still more than enough. What now?</p>

  <p>Are you planning to wait until the next chaotic era?" the Snake Spirit King asked with a serious face.</p>

  <p>Previously, he wouldn't dare to talk back like this to the black light. He didn't even have the guts to ask about its origin.</p>

  <p>After all, he owed everything that he had to the black light. Moreover, at any moment, it could also take all of them away.</p>

  <p>According to their original plan, the Snake Spirit King still needed to wait for a long time.</p>

  <p>However, he started harboring doubts after all the recent troublesome events. Also, one major factor that contributed to this was how the black light didn't allow him to kill the Bird Spirit King yet.</p>

  <p>With all these things happening, he grew more impatient. He realized that he couldn't delay their plan any longer.</p>

  <p>Understanding how Cornelius was currently feeling, the black light fell silent for a moment and eventually said, "I'll give you the permission to open the Burial Land. Then, I will light up the black lamp and upgrade."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's eyes suddenly dilated as they flashed with golden lights. This was exactly what he wanted. This was what he wanted to hear from the black light.</p>

  <p>According to their original plan, the Snake Spirit King had instructed the Element Spirit Civilization to support the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and other known powerful races to completely control the Source World. Once they completed the Purge Way, he could wait patiently, as long as the chaos was already under his control.</p>

  <p>However, now that the Evil God had mastered the Divine Dao Great Unity, and the Source World fell under his control, their situation became extremely complicated. There was no way that their plan was going to go smoothly now.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll go ahead and open Burial Land," the Snake Spirit King said without any hesitation in his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the entire chaos, there were two infamous dangerous places. The first one was the Ruin Graveyard, and the other one was the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a creature was, once they entered the two places, they wouldn't be able to leave alive.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, both places were in the depths of the chaos. For some races that lived in the chaos, they would sometimes accidentally enter these places not knowing that they would be trapped there forever. But most creatures would not leave the Source World. In this case, they wouldn't accidentally stumble in these places, so these places only existed in legends.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Looked from afar, the Burial Land appeared like a triangular piece of land. Its surface was dark cyan, and it quietly drifted slowly in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Burial Land was supposed to be a huge land mass, but with over a thousand kinds of savage races that lived there, it was still very crowded.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a group of red-eyed black birds flew across the black sky.</p>

  <p>They had just finished hunting for their prey, and the strong smell of blood still lingered on their sharp claws. After finishing their meal, they planned to return to their lair.</p>

  <p>However, just when they were about to get back, thin claws suddenly clutched on their necks at lightning speed. In an instant, their heads were decapitated and their blood was squeezed out of their bodies.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Streams of blood dripped from the sky.</p>

  <p>On the ground, there were creatures restlessly waiting with their huge mouths opened wide. They devoured all the blood that poured on them while roaring in excitement.</p>

  <p>This was a cruel and bloody world.</p>

  <p>However, even in this kind of chaotic land, a rule was still in place.</p>

  <p>All of these savage races could fight each other in a barbaric way, but no one should dare to provoke the snake-shaped statue that was located at the center of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Anyone who even just dared to approach the said statue would be instantly killed, and there had never been an exception in the countless years since its establishment.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the races living in the land deemed the area as a restricted one. No one ever tried to get close to it because it was already tested. What was the use of caring about the statue's origin if one would already be killed immediately after?</p>

  <p>That was how the Burial Land went on. But today, the statue suddenly moved on its own.</p>

  <p>The black snake left its spot and writhed down on the ground like a living creature.</p>

  <p>"I have never interfered with this place since the moment it was created.</p>

  <p>But I didn't expect it to be in such a chaotic state!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King swept his gaze across the area and was instantly vexed by the strong smell of blood throughout the land.</p>

  <p>He then controlled the black snake to soar into the sky. As it stopped in midair, a bright red light was released from its eyes. A powerful spiritual sense spread out through the red light that enveloped the entire Burial Land.</p>
