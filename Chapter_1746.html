  <p>
</p>

  <p>Finch didn't think of the corpse of a Supreme Lord as trouble.</p>

  <p>He was confused but also determined, given that he had planned this for so long.</p>

  <p>Finch was one of the earliest to have followed Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>No one knew where Supreme Lord Sword was from and how he had become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>As an ordinary force, Sword Manor couldn't foster a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>But the reason behind a Supreme Lord showing up in the Sword Manor was really simple.</p>

  <p>The Crowns of Destiny had been monopolized by the great forces in the universe like the ogres, the Thoughtless Minds, the Blessed Buddha Land and the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>The difference in the strengths of a Supreme Lord and a world lord was huge. Even if weak forces were to obtain a Crown of Destiny, they would have no time to manage to carry the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny would, at most times, be expropriated by the great forces, with the weak forces having no power to resist.</p>

  <p>This meant that a force was no longer weak once a Supreme Lord appeared within it.</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor had become one of the great forces because Sword Chen had become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>When an ogre Supreme Lord had died and the Crown of Destiny had disappeared, the entire universe was a possible place for the crown to reappear. The ogres had to try their best to find the new Crown of Destiny and bring it back.</p>

  <p>Almost all forces had joined in the battle for the Crown of Destiny but Sword Chen had ended up inheriting it. Nobody yet knew what method Sword Chen had used to stop the great forces from fighting. Even the ogres had not attacked him, even though the ogre race had lost a Crown of Destiny for this one to appear.</p>

  <p>Finch could not figure out how Sword Chen could persuade the ogre and the other forces.</p>

  <p>Finch wasn't the only one that was confused. Some Supreme Lords who weren't participating in the fight were questioning this through the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>But warriors from the great forces that had participated remained silent.</p>

  <p>Finch couldn't figure out the reason, but he was getting there with his own deductions.</p>

  <p>The reason was probably amazing and its value was definitely higher than that of a Crown of Destiny. But what in the universe would be more valuable than the Crown of Destiny?</p>

  <p>The Crowns of Destiny were the ultimate possessions in the universe. On the other hand, to become a Supreme Lord was to become one of the strongest one hundred and twenty-eight warriors of the universe.</p>

  <p>Finch, who had been just a steward of the Sword Manor at the time, had planted a seed of curiosity, which had now grown into a massive tree. He had to find the answers.</p>

  <p>It seemed like Supreme Lord Sword had had a premonition of his death before he had left. So he had arranged his heritage ahead of time and put it under the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Finch had already become the vice-leader at the time and was Sword Chen's most important subordinate. As a consequence, he became the acting leader after Sword Chen had left and waited for the one with the Whispering Sword.</p>

  <p>It was only later that Supreme Lord Sword went missing and his disappearance became an eternal mystery.</p>

  <p>And ever since then, Finch had tried to open what Supreme Lord Sword had left behind.</p>

  <p>He passed the first gate easily, for Supreme Lord Sword had not encrypted it. It only took Finch a month to enter the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>He had thought it would be easy all the way, but he was now stuck before the second gate.</p>

  <p>The thousand-legged spider had thwarted his attempts to break the gate it was guarding. It was the kind of spider that was from hell, and Finch had never been there.</p>

  <p>He had tried and failed to enter from around the gate because Supreme Lord Sword had used a brilliant technique to subtly fold the space around the gate.</p>

  <p>All he could have done was wait. And the day was finally here.</p>

  <p>He was confused and nervous when he saw Supreme Lord Sword's corpse here, but he was mostly excited because this meant that the mystery would finally be revealed.</p>

  <p>The thousand-legged spider threw Luo Luo Zheng before Supreme Lord Sword before it scuttled away to hide.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood up, an odd expression crossing his face. He had no idea what he should do and he was puzzled as he looked at Sword Chen's corpse.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took a step back, and suddenly, Sword Chen's corpse moved.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng froze. He knew he had to be careful because even if a Supreme Lord was dead, one needed to be cautious around them. Luo Luo Zheng could be killed instantly if Sword Chen had any tricks up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Finch trembled too as he looked around warily.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's corpse slowly raised its arm and pointed a gray finger at something behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The rocks behind Luo Luo Zheng trembled and made way for a cyan pool, a dim light emanating off of it. Luo Luo Zheng took a closer look and saw the hilt of a broken sword in the pool.</p>

  <p>The broken blade was shorter than two centimeters. It looked odd, like it wasn't broken by someone but melted instead.</p>

  <p>A faint light shone around the blade. It looked like the blade was still melting, but slowly.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, confused because he couldn't figure out why a broken sword had appeared here. Did it mean something?</p>

  <p>Something shifted in Finch's eyes and he aimed his sword at Luo Luo Zheng as he ordered, "Fetch the broken sword!" Finch was vigilant. He knew it wouldn't be that easy to get the broken sword since this place was so strange.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. The water in the pool was clear, and seemed innocent enough.</p>

  <p>But the moment Luo Luo Zheng touched the water, it hissed and sizzled, leaving half his finger blackened and in great pain.</p>

  <p>"My finger... is corroded!" Luo Luo Zheng said, shocked.</p>

  <p>Finch's expression reflected Luo Zheng's as he said, "Corrosive Liquid!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, don't put your hand into the pool. This liquid can corrode anything and everything," Xun said, frowning at the scene before her. No poison could affect Luo Luo Zheng but this Corrosive Liquid wasn't poisonous. It, however, was a strong corrosive force.</p>

  <p>As Finch aimed the sword at him, Luo Luo Zheng pulled out a fairy weapon and thrust it into the pool, wanting to fish the broken sword out of the liquid.</p>

  <p>But the moment Luo Luo Zheng put the weapon in, the blade began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>It melted and disappeared the moment it was submerged in the Corrosive Liquid. The corrosive force of the liquid was far stronger than Luo Luo Zheng had anticipated.</p>

  <p>"I am not a patient person. Just grab it!" Finch said coldly as he thrust the sword at Luo Zheng's shoulder, drawing blood.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help it now that he was facing Finch. But he was still hesitant as he looked at the Corrosive Liquid.</p>

  <p>Finch grunted angrily as he thrust his sword at Xun without any warning.</p>

  <p>Her body of sword spirit was smashed into tiny red dots of light that slowly condensed into the shape of a girl again. It was the body of a sword spirit, but Luo Luo Zheng could feel that Xun was badly wounded.</p>

  <p>Finch's strike seemed to be powerful enough to hurt even a spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>He knew he didn't have a choice now. So he reached out into the pool.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng put his hands into the pool, the flesh and blood of his hands dissipated slowly, making it easy for everyone to see the process clearly. The Corrosive Liquid was really powerful.</p>

  <p>He could feel his hands burn, as if by a fire that couldn't be doused.</p>

  <p>Great pain spread along his hands.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng finally grabbed the broken sword, all that was left of his hands were bones.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grabbed the broken sword out of the pool.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Finch flew towards Luo Luo Zheng before he could react. dozens of rays of the sword light hit the broken sword and shook off the Corrosive Liquid on it. Finch seized the broken sword and brandished it.</p>

  <p>Was it the heritage of Supreme Lord Sword? Finch was ecstatic.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't belong to you. Give it to Luo Luo Zheng," a strange voice echoed.</p>

  <p>The voice sounded old and came from the direction of the corpse. Finch had been nervous since they had found the corpse of Supreme Lord Sword. Hearing the voice was the last straw and Finch, startled and frightened, lashed out with the sword.</p>

  <p>The sword light rushed toward the corpse and began to fold like a piece of paper. Once it had folded several times over, the sword light disappeared.</p>

  <p>Finch was aware that only a few people in the universe could withstand his strike. No one apart from the Supreme Lords and grand world lords could do that.</p>

  <p>Finch was still in shock but he decided to escape with the broken sword.</p>

  <p>He believed that this sword hid all of the secrets and that he would finally figure them out as long as he had the broken sword.</p>

  <p>He activated the Sword Step and rushed toward the gate. His Sword Step was much stronger than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>But he froze in the air while he was just a few feet away.</p>

  <p>An invisible force was controlling him, rendering him motionless.</p>

  <p>Xun looked at Finch, not surprised at the scene because she knew that someone would do it. But she hadn't expected the one to take action would be someone so powerful. It wasn't an ordinary Supreme Lord who had done so.</p>

  <p>Finch struggled, panicking, but he couldn't resist the force.</p>

  <p>"Who? Who's that?!" he screamed.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had passed away a long time ago. He might have set some traps, but it was impossible for those traps to control Finch like this.</p>

  <p>A figure slowly emerged behind Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>The figure was in fancy robes, embroidered with special golden patterns.</p>

  <p>Finch thought the patterns were familiar and wondered where he had seen them before.</p>

  <p> </p>
