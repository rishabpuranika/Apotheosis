  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, Mist had also entered the Sea God Continent, but he had been intimidated by the Cursed Land. In the end, he set up a massive transmission array, connecting the two continents and then waiting in the celestial tomb for several years, long before Luo Luo Zheng finally arrived.</p>

  <p>Because of that, Luo Luo Zheng figured that Mist was a Spirit Supreme Realm expert. If he couldn't enter the Cursed Land, the seven of them wouldn't be able to enter either.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to enter the Cursed Land unhindered. But at that time, he was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm. Now, at the Life and Death Realm, naturally, he would be affected by the curse's power.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng briefly explained the whole situation of the Cursed Land to everyone, Max's expression turned slightly grim. Still, he ordered Hank to control the Eight-diagram Wheel to move forward.</p>

  <p>They managed to fly fast above the Sea God Continent. Not long after, a distinct line appeared in the Sea God Continent. On the surface, everything seemed perfectly normal. Inside the line, however, it was pitch-black. No plants or creatures seemed to inhabit it? it was a pitch-black world.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Cursed Land?" Max could only stare at it and wonder.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng nodded, Delroy went ahead and said, "Let's go down and take a look."</p>

  <p>As Spirit Supreme Realm experts, they weren't reckless people. Since they already knew that it was a strange land, they wouldn't dare rely on their own cultivation to forcefully break into it immediately.</p>

  <p>After the Eight-diagram Wheel slowly descended, the seven of them stepped down, one after another. With the Ancestral Dragon still in his arms, Luo Luo Zheng followed and jumped down. The little thing looked at the Cursed Land, fear growing in its eyes. It seemed worried about Luo Luo Zheng bringing it to such a place.</p>

  <p>"Gagoom?" the dragon went.</p>

  <p>Seeing how frightened the creature was, Luo Luo Zheng patted its head and smiled gently, "Don't worry. I won't bring you in."</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was rather curious? this Ancestral Dragon had just hatched.</p>

  <p>Although it had a strong innate talent, it should've only been considered a first-level vicious beast, meaning it wouldn't be affected by the curse.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, its fear was purely instinctive.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Max had an evident frown on his face as he examined the area. "Delroy, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>Taking two steps forward, Delroy approached the edge. Another step forward and he would have entered the Cursed Land. After a short pause, he extended his hand beyond the edge.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! The curse is very strong!" Luo Luo Zheng reminded him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already personally witnessed two war sages turn into pools of blood in an instant. The power of the curse didn't seem to be something any ordinary human could withstand.</p>

  <p>But Delroy paid him no mind and stubbornly continued to extend his hand into the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>The activation of the curse would take some time? he just wanted to test how strong the curse really was.</p>

  <p>After a moment, his expression changed as he quickly retracted his hand and retreated. "Dorothea!"</p>

  <p>Taking one step forward, Dorothea had the flower in her eye spin rapidly.</p>

  <p>From the flower's pistil shone a bright pink light.</p>

  <p>Underneath, something was illuminated.</p>

  <p>After taking a look, Luo Luo Zheng found a bunch of little ghosts.</p>

  <p>All were only about the size of a finger. In spite of their size, they looked extremely disgusting, and more so being so densely packed together? there were hundreds of them. All swarmed toward Delroy's right hand and began gnawing at it.</p>

  <p>Buzz... buzz... buzz...</p>

  <p>To protect his right hand, Delroy activated his life vitality and opened a small enchanted barrier. The little ghosts, however, completely ignored the defense and continued attacking. The flesh and blood on his hand seemed to melt into streams of pus? it was an appalling sight.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the little ghosts ate up Delroy's right hand completely and were ready to move up along his arm.</p>

  <p>But being a bold expert, Delroy gave a pointed, calm look at Woody who stood beside him.</p>

  <p>Understanding his meaning, Woody wielded his Black Nether Saber and swung.</p>

  <p>With only one bone left, Delroy's hand was sliced off and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Unable to crawl up, the little ghosts simply turned around to continue gnawing at his hand bone.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! What the hell are these things?" Woody could feel his scalp begin to tingle as he watched the densely packed creatures. They weren't particularly strong, but they could completely bypass the life vitality defense? they even broke through Delroy's enchanted barrier. It was just too terrifying.</p>

  <p>In spite of all that, the look in Delroy's eye was calm. With a gentle wave of his right arm, a golden spurt of blood came out from the wound. As it continued to flow, it formed the shape of his hand. And after the last bit of the golden light dissipated, it began to form the bones and meridians, quickly regenerating the skin. In only a few moments, a right hand was there once again.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng was astonished? Delroy truly had great token. Of course, in the Lower World, a broken limb could be reconstructed. But the warrior's strength could be greatly damaged and the new limb could end up a new weakness in one's body.</p>

  <p>But the nonchalant expression on Delroy's face made Luo Luo Zheng think that maybe he had the ability to regenerate his body without any damaging after-effects.</p>

  <p>Under the pink light from Dorothea's right eye, the little ghosts had nowhere to hide.</p>

  <p>Everyone could hear as they crunched through the bone. The warriors trembled with fear and disgust.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Max walked over and took a closer look at the ghosts. "Are these the?"</p>

  <p>"It's a Ghost Curse Spell. But it's an extremely rare thing to release such a large area of the Ghost Curse Spell in the Lower World," Dorothea explained.</p>

  <p>In other aspects, Max and Delroy were quite knowledgeable already, but when it came to soul incantations, Dorothea's expertise came into play.</p>

  <p>Delroy's hand bone was eaten up rapidly.</p>

  <p>The little ghosts scattered and dashed toward the Cursed Land. Soon after, they disappeared from everyone's view.</p>

  <p>Observing the Cursed Land, Max frowned and asked Luo Luo Zheng, "Did you say that only martial artists below the Life and Death Realm can enter this Cursed Land?"</p>

  <p>With a nod, Luo Luo Zheng answered, "In this continent, Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors are considered war lords. Once warriors of the Sea God Continent become top-level war lords, they have made it to the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and they have to leave this Cursed Land. Otherwise, the curse will take their lives."</p>

  <p>The Cursed Land was forbidden to war sages and Soul Sea Realm experts, after all.</p>

  <p>Flatly, Dorothea explained, "This Ghost Curse Spell has set a target for it to take effect? it isn't difficult."</p>

  <p>"What should we do? How are we going to get to the Tower of Crystal?" asked the burly man.</p>

  <p>Staring at the Cursed Land, Delroy said, "I don't believe this place is filled with the Ghost Curse Spell!"</p>

  <p>With a knowing smile, Dorothea returned, "You'll know when you see it, won't you?" The moment she finished speaking, the flower in her right eye began to spin, emitting a pink light a hundred times broader than the last one.</p>

  <p>In this moment of illumination, Luo Luo Zheng, Max, Delroy, and the others were all astonished.</p>

  <p>An endless wave of little ghosts filled the Cursed Land. Because there were too many, they had to squeeze together? they were in a constant state of crazy squirming.</p>

  <p>Because it was too crowded, the ghosts seemed to devour each other. But soon afterward, new little ghosts would be born.</p>

  <p>"Kof kof kof..." Goosebumps rose all over Woody's body. In a haste, he said, "Dorothea, extinguish that light!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Woody. Other than Max and Dorothea, the rest looked absolutely horrified.</p>

  <p>It made Luo Luo Zheng frown? he was the only one among them who had entered the Cursed Land. Never did he think that in the seemingly empty place, ghosts were already lining up. A chill crept up from the depths of his heart.</p>
