<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A thick cloud of silence seemed to envelope the whole world...</p>

  <p>Many of the Soul Sea Realm masters were quiet as well.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the silence was disrupted by a click of a tongue. "So, does it mean all of the mountains within the four divine kingdoms have been destroyed?" Turner asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not just the mountains of the four divine kingdoms. The mountains in the Central Region and in other areas were destroyed as well. Almost all of this great world's mountains have been destroyed," Luo Luo Zheng honestly responded.</p>

  <p>In reality, many of the Soul Sea Realm masters had already had a tough estimate when Luo Luo Zheng said he had transferred the power to the mountains.</p>

  <p>If a Soul Sea Realm master like War Emperor York took action to attack Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng would transfer the power of that attack, and that power would be enough to destroy a whole mountain range.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning the black eye emitted was quite terrifying, and the power within the black light was extremely and unimaginably strong. If Luo Luo Zheng transferred all of the power into the mountains, how many mountains would he need?</p>

  <p>The Divine Kingdom Continent had many peaks and mountain ranges of various sizes. There wasn't any accurate record of the number of peaks and mountain ranges, but a rough estimate showed that there were at least several hundred thousand mountains out there.</p>

  <p>But with even that many mountains, would it be enough to counter the power within the black light?</p>

  <p>How many mountains would be needed to offset its power? A thousand mountains? Ten thousand mountains? Or a hundred thousand mountains?</p>

  <p>In reality, about five million mountains were needed to offset the power.</p>

  <p>All the mountains in the whole world had been destroyed, with the exception of some mountains in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters went silent, but they were shocked the next second. They realized how great its impact would be on the entire great world.</p>

  <p>And, what was the limit of Luo Zheng's power transferring ability?</p>

  <p>He was actually able to freely transfer the power to the entire great world. Could it be possible that he could represent the whole of it as well?</p>

  <p>Someone had finally come up with an answer, but of course, they still weren't able to guess that Luo Luo Zheng had fused with the world's will. Thus, it could be said that Luo Luo Zheng himself was the whole great world!</p>

  <p>"What exactly is that black eye?" War King Wind asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>He sighed deeply when he couldn't find any answers.</p>

  <p>A single move had destroyed a huge portion of the whole world's mountains. What on earth was that thing?</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the eye's owner must've thought that Luo Luo Zheng was too weak and incapable of blocking the black light's fatal strike.</p>

  <p>Just a small release of the black light was enough to destroy the mountains of the whole world. If a few more would be released, wouldn't the whole great world be destroyed?</p>

  <p>How powerful exactly was the eye's owner? It was truly hard for everyone to imagine. Even the damage of the mountains alone was already too much.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," Luo Luo Zheng said and shook his head. Even the cyan dragon couldn't answer the question, more so Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Derek, the white-browed Taoist priest, said, "I don't know what it is, but such an enormous power might at least belong to a Supreme Lord. Perhaps the owner of that eye is a Supreme Lord!"</p>

  <p>"A Supreme Lord?" At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng understood something.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were the most powerful beings in the universe. To destroy a great world was an easy task for them.</p>

  <p>"Not only the Supreme Lords, but also the world lords in the Upper World could be so powerful as to destroy a great world. However, it isn't easy for a world lord or a Supreme Lord to do that. I can't even figure out this eye's origin?" the cyan dragon in Luo Zheng's mind remarked.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Luo Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Both of them couldn't determine this eye's origins or background. Who exactly did it belong to? Why did it take action against him?</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Luo Zheng had passed through a tough challenge, taking the whole world as his backup force! As for that strange black eye? Luo Luo Zheng considered it as a part of the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't a careless person and was wary of his judgment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might not have enemies in the Upper World, but there must be a reason for the black eye to have attacked him. He wondered if the Lotus Flower, which had bloomed, had prompted it to do so. Or was it for some other reason? No matter what, he would have to be very careful in the future.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had stepped into the Life and Death Realm, the slowly rotating life vitality in his body had become thick as a heavy paste. In this way, his belly could bear more life vitality and his life vitality would be even more condensed. Moreover, his strength would increase greatly.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had completed his breakthrough, he set his target on the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. He had promised to help the cyan dragon obtain the Ancestral Dragon egg, so he had to make this trip at any cost.</p>

  <p>Before he set off however, he had to deal with the matters he faced now.</p>

  <p>A strange vibe tugged at Luo Zheng's senses when he approached the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at him in a completely different way.</p>

  <p>Most Soul Sea Realm masters believed what War Emperor York and the Holy Maiden said. They were well aware that Luo Luo Zheng did not come from the four divine kingdoms. Although they were not as hostile as War Emperor York when they looked at Luo Luo Zheng before, they were definitely not close to him. They all seemed indifferent to him.</p>

  <p>However, there was a trace of gentleness in everyone's eyes now. It was clear that they treated Luo Luo Zheng as a family member...</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw the weird way the dozens of Soul Sea Realm masters gazed at him, he felt a chill run down his spine. He quickly thought if something was wrong with them.</p>

  <p>However, he was unaware that those Soul Sea Realm masters considered him as a treasure in their eyes, At that point, Luo Luo Zheng had already turned the key to open the ascending passageway, and he had also opened the Mahayana Lotus Flower. All this showed that he could be a promising achiever in the Upper World in the future. Everyone thought that it was a good thing to form a relationship with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Alright, now it's time to distribute the minerals we've obtained!" Luo Luo Zheng announced, still being a bit stunned.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no intentions of taking all the treasures from the top layers of the tree. First of all, he wasn't a weapon refiner. Although majority of the minerals were precious, they were of little use to Luo Luo Zheng himself. However, he had already let the cyan dragon identify some of the ores that could be used to create the high-grade divine texture, and Luo Luo Zheng had chosen to keep those items.</p>

  <p>As for the other items, Luo Luo Zheng decided to let Turner distribute them. After all, he was in the territory of the four divine kingdoms. Even if Luo Luo Zheng had dug them out himself, it would be unrealistic if he had kept all of them.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng finished his words, a Soul Sea Realm master laughed and said,</p>

  <p>"Distribute? Tianxing, you dug out all the ores by yourself. Isn't it a little inappropriate to distribute them to everyone like this?"</p>

  <p>Turner smiled and said, "That's right. There are a lot of priceless minerals, so you should not give them to others like that. However, there are some things that we need. Tianxing, you can fix prices for them and sell them to us."</p>

  <p>"This..." Luo Luo Zheng was stunned. He deeply suspected that there might be something wrong with those Soul Sea Realm masters. He wondered why they treated him so well after he had undergone a tribulation.</p>

  <p>Could it be that they were plotting something?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Derek and Marine silently observed Luo Luo Zheng. The news about Luo Luo Zheng would definitely be reported through the Reverse Spirit Channel, but now was not the time. They would wait until Luo Luo Zheng had dealt with the ores first.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought for a while, but still couldn't figure out what was going on.</p>

  <p>He mentally communicated with the cyan dragon, but the cyan dragon also didn't understand what those masters meant. After all, the cyan dragon also didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng was tied up to the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't figure it out, Luo Luo Zheng simply ignored this question and took out the ores one by one from his space ring.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had previously dug out the ores, a lot of the Soul Sea Realm masters eagerly watched him. They were quite keen on what kind of ores Luo Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>There weren't many ores in the leaves of the forty-fifth layer to forty-seventh layer, but each ore had its own unique shape.</p>

  <p>For example, the first crystal that Luo Luo Zheng had taken out from his space ring was like water as it slipped between his fingers and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the blue liquid quickly merged and formed a small round ball that continuously jumped about on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "In that case, how much can this Water Crystal cost if I sell it to you?"</p>
