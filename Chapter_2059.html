<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2059 The Hall Of Holy Beings' Rules </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Pranav's sudden appearance stunned Luo Zheng, Xun, and many of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>After he broke Margaret's neck like it was nothing, he looked down at the martial artists below him, making the corners of his mouth curve up into a cold and indifferent smile. After carefully examining Margaret's neck, a malicious voice escaped his lips. "She looks pretty good. It's a pity to kill her like this..."</p>

  <p>With that, he casually tossed her body to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart raced wildly as he saw her soft body fall like a doll— he could feel the grief pierce his body like a spear.</p>

  <p>When he was in the Central Region, she never hesitated to follow him all the way into the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>After flying to the Upper World, she mastered the powerful sword arrays and searched for him in the large Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Even after going to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she did all she could to find him.</p>

  <p>After her return, Mu Ning was quickly brought back to the Celestial Position race. Although she really wanted to look for Luo Zheng, she had to practice the Gods Killing Sword Array before getting another chance to find him.</p>

  <p>In her heart, it was as though nothing existed in the world save for Luo Zheng— she barely even had a sense of her own self and cared for Luo Zheng wildly.</p>

  <p>This woman had chased him with all her might. But compared to how Luo Zheng treated Xun or Ning Yudie, he treated her with more indifference.</p>

  <p>He often neglected her and perhaps only felt responsible for what he had done to her on impulse in the past.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, seeing Margaret's neck suddenly broken like that, he could feel a sharp pain in his chest, nearly making his heart burst.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Without enough time to vent his anger, Luo Zheng flew straight toward Mu Ning and held her in his arms.</p>

  <p>Her neck was completely crushed and Luo Zheng felt no trace of her life energy.</p>

  <p>He hugged her soft, limp body and felt loneliness and helplessness wash over him.</p>

  <p>Her death was so sudden, shocking everyone there. The Gods Killing Sword Array was of great importance to the Celestial Position race. With her gone, who could master it?</p>

  <p>But everyone's attention was elsewhere as they fixated on the young man in black.</p>

  <p>He exuded a gentle Mu Ning— it was deceiving, as though he had no sense of violence in him. But no one dared brush him off.</p>

  <p>The gentle Mu Ning was the momentum of a True God. He was a True God from the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Such a thought filled everyone's eyes with fear.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that a group of creatures formed from life vitality would cause master so much trouble. It turns out that those warriors of the Murphy Universe are all good for nothing," Pranav remarked with a faint smile, his eyes still locked on the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Pranav's inner world was close to perfection. Even the Supreme Lords had appeared in his inner world, but they were far inferior to the Supreme Lords in the universe in terms of strength. But in Pranav's eyes, the creatures of the Evolutionary Universe and the Sacred warriors of the Murphy Universe were merely secondary creatures formed from life vitality. To him, they weren't true life forms in the least.</p>

  <p>"Huff..."</p>

  <p>Just then, Wynn arrived and stood opposite Pranav. His eyes flashed with faint starlight as he said, "We've fought before."</p>

  <p>On the Breaking Cloud Mountain, Pranav had used the secret arts of the nine Sacred Supreme Lords to send a strike across the universe. But in the end, Wynn forced him back.</p>

  <p>"I don't have a good memory, so I don't remember that." Pranav shook his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You're no match for me." Wynn's expression was dead-serious.</p>

  <p>Although Wynn was Mike's last disciple and the youngest, his talent was the most outstanding— he was very confident in his strength.</p>

  <p>Since Mike had the best relationship with him, he was asked to stay in the Evolutionary Universe to help his master pass safely through the crisis.</p>

  <p>But the time flow rate was too fast in the Evolutionary Universe. After hiding there for years, his skeletal age had grown. But a True God had an eternal lifespan, so the word 'old' wasn't appropriate for Wynn. So long as he wanted to, he could easily recover his youthful appearance with a thought. But he wanted to use his current appearance to remind himself of the time he had spent in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Although the True God of the Murphy Universe had finally made his move, Wynn just announced that Pranav was truly no match for him.</p>

  <p>These words had all the Supreme Lords overjoyed. If Wynn could kill this man, the pressure on these Supreme Lords would lessen significantly. And if Wynn still had enough energy and strength left to help the Supreme Lords after killing the young man in black, they all might even be able to obtain a genuine victory.</p>

  <p>But Pranav's following words made the Supreme Lords' hearts sink.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he stated calmly. "I am not your opponent. But what if I fight against you along with my master's other two disciples?"</p>

  <p>Pranav was a True God himself, so his master's other two disciples could have been True Gods as well.</p>

  <p>That meant that three True Gods of the Murphy Universe had been sent.</p>

  <p>The news was shocking. "This doesn't conform to the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings," Wynn said indignantly. "Murphy cannot do that!"</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings had developed countless divine eras with a comprehensive set of rules. Even the Holy Beings couldn't break the rules so easily in a battle.</p>

  <p>For instance, a Holy Being wasn't allowed to personally attack the universe of another Holy Being.</p>

  <p>It was because of this rule that Murphy couldn't step into the Evolutionary Universe himself. Otherwise, with Murphy's strength, he could destroy the universe quickly. In this case, there was no need for him to pour much energy or time into cultivating the Sacred race, and secretly allowing the sorcerer race and the Demon Night to develop within the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Another rule was that if the two universes were to fight each other, only one True God could be sent to join the battle.</p>

  <p>Mike had many disciples as well. He had only arranged for Wynn to stay in the universe and even this was limited by the rule.</p>

  <p>But Pranav only chuckled. "Rules can be modified. My master has spent much effort in changing this rule. You can always ask for help. Isn't Mike's chief disciple, Harold, very strong?"</p>

  <p>Wynn's gaze grew colder. Changing the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings was no easy task. Since Murphy was willing to pay such a huge price to change the rules, how could he let Mike's disciples step into the Evolutionary Universe so easily?</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a chance to live. Leave this universe this instant. If you see me in the divine land in the future, you must take a detour and avoid me," Pranav said with a smile. While he admitted that he was no match for Wynn, he had his master's support.</p>

  <p>Mike was expected to perish, so his disciples in the divine land would not know peace. Pranav naturally didn't fear Wynn.</p>

  <p>A sneer crossed Wynn's face. "None of my master's disciples will flinch.</p>

  <p>You needn't say so much."</p>

  <p>"That's a pity. I can only summon my fellows to kill you..." said Pranav, shaking his head. If the passageway to the Sighing Wall was unblocked, the True Gods could easily travel from one universe to another.</p>

  <p>But before Pranav could finish speaking, an extremely violent Mu Ning erupted from below him. As it did, a ray of golden light shot towards him while an explosion resounded in the air.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's entire body was covered in dazzling golden light as the Emperor Soul Imprint appeared. Under the frenzied combustion of his soul, his soul power was released without reservation.</p>

  <p>Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and the others were terrified. As Supreme Lords, they also had the Gold Fighting Souls. But the soul pressure Luo Zheng emitted was rather formidable.</p>

  <p>They had only been affected by the Mu Ning and it was that True God who was truly facing the soul pressure.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, stop!"</p>

  <p>Wynn was in shock— he didn't expect Luo Zheng to act so recklessly. It was too late for Wynn to stop him.</p>

  <p>Feeling Zheng's Mu Ning, Pranav was rather surprised. Clearly, Luo Zheng was only a world lord. How could the power from his soul combustion put any pressure on Pranav?</p>

  <p>A True God's soul had stepped onto another higher realm. There, the soul and the Godly Tile had fused together. With the soul's primary divinity, such a soul far surpassed the Gold Fighting Soul.</p>

  <p>But Pranav only admired Zheng's imposing Mu Ning. A look of disdain filled his eyes when Luo Zheng rashly charged at him. He then extended a hand towards Luo Zheng and spread his fingers. "The secondary creatures are always so reckless, but your courage is commendable..."</p>

  <p>Looking down at Luo Zheng as he rushed over, Pranav wanted to crush his sword with a single hand and proceed to crush his entire body.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng slashed at Pranav's palm with the Great Weighty Sword, Pranav widened his eyes in shock.</p>
