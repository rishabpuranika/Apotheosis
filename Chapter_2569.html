<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2569 Cave Of Wildness </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's news was true and the exiles could leave this world, then the dispute between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race would no longer matter.</p>

  <p>The bone towers were fortresses, but who in their right mind would stay willingly in that damned place forever?</p>

  <p>The oldest man among them wanted to make Luo Zheng stronger in hopes that he'd be able to take them back to the Source World one day.</p>

  <p>"I'd face any obstacle and experience every pain if it means getting stronger!" Luo Zheng proclaimed.</p>

  <p>The old man only smiled and turned to Giacomo. "Let Luo Zheng absorb the wild bones first. When the Body Tribulations arrive, give him ten shares of blood wild bones."</p>

  <p>"Ten shares of blood wild bones?" Giacomo asked in disbelief. "Can he endure them?"</p>

  <p>Ten shares of blood wild bones didn't mean just ten blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>Blood wild bones were very precious in the outside world as well as in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>And because of the value they held, one would think that there was a scarcity of them. But in truth, if the blood wild bones were distributed according to the blood purity of Nine Li members, there would be enough for everyone and more. This was because very few could handle their power.</p>

  <p>For instance, even though Romeo was a genius of the fifth-grade bloodline, he could only use two shares of blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>It was also said that Adele only used three shares to undergo the Body Tribulations in the past. Otherwise, the burst of the Body Tribulations would be too powerful for her to withstand.</p>

  <p id="top_15"><a id="p14396" class="calibre2"></a>The old man looked at Luo Zheng and smiled. "His body is different from ours.</p>

  <p>I don't know how he cultivated this body, but it's so much stronger than an ordinary person's. He can withstand ten shares of the blood wild bones."</p>

  <p>"I see,"</p>

  <p>Giacomo nodded.</p>

  <p>The old man was the most powerful warrior in the Nine Li race. His cultivation base was unfathomable and his insight was incomparable.</p>

  <p>Giacomo would be foolish not to trust his judgement.</p>

  <p>"We'll all be watching," said the old man before his body melted into the shadows and disappeared from Luo Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>After that, Giacomo took Luo Zheng through the warehouses where Luo Zheng noticed several cracks that emitted Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Around each crack, more than ten people were busy extracting the Wild God Power from the wild bones.</p>

  <p>However, none of them absorbed the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Instead, they guided the flow of the Wild God Power into the cracks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was puzzled. What were they doing?</p>

  <p>"This is the Cave of Wildness and Wild God Power can't escape from it," explained Giacomo after seeing Luo Zheng's expression. "Romeo, Elsa, and Killian are cultivating in the cave and they need a lot of Wild God Power. That's why these people are extracting the Wild God Power and injecting it into the cave."</p>

  <p>"Really? That's amazing!" Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It was indeed not a difficult thing to extract the Wild God Power from the wild bones. Even an ordinary person could do it. There might be a slight difference in the methods, but these methods were all useful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't expect that the geniuses of Nine Li race had such privileges.</p>

  <p>They didn't even need to extract the Wild God Power from wild bones themselves.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Giacomo were close enough, one of the men walked over to them and bowed his head in greeting. "Elder Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo nodded in regard. "Baldwin, I have new orders. Ask Doran to leave the cave."</p>

  <p>Baldwin looked up with a start, unsure if he had heard right. He glanced at Luo Zheng before turning to Giacomo, conflicted. "I don't think it's appropriate to do this, Elder Giacomo. If we do, Elder Celia would surely get angry with us."</p>

  <p>After Chandler's and Farhann's deaths, the Nine Li race had chosen two other men to fight for the race. One of them was Doran, whose mother was Elder Celia.</p>

  <p>In this period of time, they invested all of the race's resources in these five young warriors.</p>

  <p>This was why Doran was trying his best to cultivate. It was a great opportunity and he wanted to make everyone proud. But now Giacomo wanted him to pull out.</p>

  <p>Giacomo's face darkened at Baldwin's words. "Do as I say!"</p>

  <p>Nodding meekly, Baldwin said nothing more and walked away. He was curious about the young man standing beside Giacomo. He had never seen that man before, but he must be important if he was going to replace Doran.</p>

  <p>Under Giacomo's command, Baldwin ordered the people to halt the extraction of Wild God Power before he entered the cave.</p>

  <p>In the depths, a young man in black was sitting cross legged, continuously absorbing Wild God Power. It was Doran, and when he saw Baldwin coming in, he frowned. "Baldwin, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Elder Giacomo asked you to leave the cave. You're being replaced by someone else."</p>

  <p>"What?" Doran's face darkened as he stood abruptly. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Baldwin shook his head. "You can ask Elder Giacomo in person."</p>

  <p>The purity of Doran's blood was also fifth grade, but when it came to talent, he was slightly weaker than Romeo and others. He had never had a chance to prove himself.</p>

  <p>Farhann and Chandler were dead, and it was his turn now to fight for the Nine Li race. He had been ecstatic when he was chosen to fight and he valued this rare opportunity greatly. They didn't expect him to just leave so calmly, did they?</p>

  <p>Stomping out of the cave, Doran angrily marched straight to Giacomo.</p>

  <p>"Giacomo, what are you doing?" asked Doran, his teeth clenched and skin white with anger. His mother, Elder Celia, held a high position in the Nine Li race and was even stronger than Giacomo. He would have some manners when he met Giacomo in normal times, but at this moment, he was bearing a grudge and called Giacomo by his name.</p>

  <p>"The plan has changed and someone else is to take your place inside the cave," Giacomo replied calmly. While he did not expect this level of anger from Doran, he was unfazed by it.</p>

  <p>"Someone else? I know every member of the Nine Li race! Who else is more qualified than me?" Doran asked coldly before his gaze shifted to Luo Zheng. "Are you talking about him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Giacomo. "I am."</p>

  <p>"He's a member of our race?" Doran looked Luo Zheng up and down. He couldn't remember anyone like him in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Their argument immediately attracted the others' attention. Meanwhile, Romeo came out of another cave and noticed Luo Zheng standing not far away from him. A smile appeared on his face as he walked up to him. "Hi, Luo Zheng! You're here. Have you accepted the blood of our race already?"</p>

  <p>After Romeo went back to the bone tower of the Nine Li race, he told the elders about Luo Zheng. According to the original plan, they would give Luo Zheng Chiyou's blood so that he could be a member of their race.</p>

  <p>The acquired blood was weaker than the blood born with, but Luo Zheng himself was powerful enough, which would make up for it.</p>

  <p>However, getting the blood transfusion would take some time, and Romeo was curious why Luo Zheng was sent to the Cave of Wildness so soon.</p>

  <p>"A foreigner with the blood transfusion wants to squeeze me out of the Cave of Wildness? Why?" Hearing Romeo's words, Doran became even more furious. Competing with Luo Zheng only smeared his reputation!</p>
