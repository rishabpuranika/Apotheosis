<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1463 The Malicious Mu Ning In The Abyss </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed Livingston and thrust him into his spirit beast bag. His gaze scanned the bag to make sure he had placed him well.</p>

  <p>The other warriors had traces of envy on their faces...</p>

  <p>They were not sure if Livingston's weapon refining skills were truly that stupendous. However, he did just mention that he was the one who had refined the bunch of ancient treasures before them.</p>

  <p>The ancient treasures were not low-rank weapons. A weapon refiner like him would be extremely sought after in any tenth grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Even if Livingston was a swindler, he could at least unravel the secrets of the underground palace after living here for so many years as a puppet.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had simply picked up Livingston and thrown him into his spirit beast bag, the other warriors were naturally unhappy.</p>

  <p>However, they could do nothing about it. Luo Zheng did not plan to reveal anything about what he was up to. Obviously, he did not want Livingston to disclose too many secrets, so he threw him into the spirit beast bag at the first opportunity…</p>

  <p>Besides the martial artists of the three sacred places, the three Saint Lords outside of the underground palace were also upset to see what Luo Zheng had done.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the human race shook his head and said, "This boy is going too far. He shouldn't want everything for himself!"</p>

  <p>A weapon refiner able to refine divine weapons was an important asset in any tenth grade sacred place. The Saint Lords were most aware of this.</p>

  <p>The shortage of divine weapons in Magnolia Sacred Place was a constant source of burden for its Saint Lord.</p>

  <p>Although Magnolia Sacred Place was responsible for a part of the trade, it was only a trade channel for the Humanity Alliance. They did not get any real benefits.</p>

  <p>"Ha! For now, just let him take everything he wants in the Endless Abyss. It seems this kid has come into a fortune, but he still has to leave the underground palace. I want to see if he can make it out of the Dark World alive!" the Saint Lord of the ogre race said, an ugly sneer on his face.</p>

  <p>These words caused the human Saint Lord to frown. "No matter what, the boy is from the thirteen palaces. If he can return here safely, I will ensure that he also leaves this place safely. Don't ever entertain that idea again…"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was in the underground palace, was naturally not privy to this discussion. After he stuffed Livingston into his spirit beast bag, he called Freya and left the cave. As for the pile of ancient treasures, Luo Zheng did not even spare them a single glance.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng call her, Freya hurriedly collected a few ancient treasures before following him contentedly.</p>

  <p>Silently, she calculated how many life vitality jades these ancient treasures could be exchanged for. Just now, she had carefully selected a dozen or so ancient treasures of extraordinary quality. Although the treasures were not worth much, she would be satisfied to sell them for a handful of life vitality jades…</p>

  <p>Soon, the remaining ancient treasures got divided among the rest of the warriors.</p>

  <p>One could imagine how dejected the warriors of the three races were. In the first cave, Luo Zheng had obtained the World Tree's seed. That was acceptable. In the second cave, there was a pile of ancient treasures, but Luo Zheng had instead taken away a puppet with unknown origins who was obviously of great importance. From the looks of it, the other warriors would only end up being bit part players in this exploration of the underground palace!</p>

  <p>However, although they felt indignant and were understandably disturbed, they still followed Luo Zheng in unison.</p>

  <p>In fact, they too knew subconsciously that Zheng's strength was extraordinary and that he could lead them deeper into the abyss.</p>

  <p>"So... Let's continue to go down." Luo Zheng smiled at Freya. He slid sleekly on the ground and then fell into the abyss.</p>

  <p>Freya did not say anything. She trusted Luo Zheng fully. She too tilted her body and jumped down.</p>

  <p>The other warriors, such as Lincoln and the others, followed Luo Zheng and leaped into the abyss once again…</p>

  <p>Just as Xun had described, the abyss was in fact a ring. Luo Zheng and the others felt that they were falling down the abyss, but in reality, they were just flying round a giant ring.</p>

  <p>Every time they finished a circle around the ring, a new cave would appear.</p>

  <p>According to Xun's prediction, there was a limit to the number of circles they could make around this ring. The Supreme Lord from the remote ages had probably set a test to pass five circles on this ring.</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand years ago, Xun had passed four circles. The greatest secret of the Endless Abyss should be revealed after the fifth circle…</p>

  <p>The fifth circle was Zheng's destination.</p>

  <p>He had only finished two circles when the third one began.</p>

  <p>By now, the warriors were used to falling like this and kept their bodies bent at a certain angle. This way, they could adjust their positions freely and tackle the dangers that came at them at any moment.</p>

  <p>The other warriors here, except Freya, Luo Zheng, and Lincoln, were at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>At this time, Freya wondered if it was finally the time for her to give up.</p>

  <p>Perhaps with Zheng's help, she could go further. After some thought, she decided to observe for a while before activating the divine texture to return to the entrance. Then she could choose to wait for Luo Zheng outside the underground palace.</p>

  <p>As they kept falling for about five minutes, they encountered no danger.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened in the entire abyss.</p>

  <p>Despite so, no one let down their guards. After all, from what they had learnt from the previous two times they fell, it was always relatively safe at the beginning of the fall. The dangers often came out of nowhere and occurred in an instant. Thus, they had all become more cautious this time.</p>

  <p>In the second cave, they had not come across much. They only got their hands on a few abandoned ancient treasures, so now they could only place their hopes on the third cave.</p>

  <p>"There is something down there. Everyone, be careful," the blonde woman of the Demon Night race, who had been keeping an eye below her all this time, said to other members of her race in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes, his gaze sweeping down into the abyss. He frowned slightly as he asked, "What is that?"</p>

  <p>They saw a mass of blood-red color appear at the bottom of the abyss.</p>

  <p>The moment it appeared, every martial artist felt their hearts tighten.</p>

  <p>"What… such an intense malicious Mu Ning!"</p>

  <p>"This malicious Mu Ning…. How will we bear it?!"</p>

  <p>"We can avoid its impact by maintaining our state of mind!"</p>

  <p>As they continued to descend, the color of the surrounding walls too began to change. Cracks began to appear on the walls. Within the cracks were circulating dots of red light, as if the cracks were the blood vessels of a living being. Malicious Mu Ning exuded from the walls continuously.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid the malicious Mu Ning, the warriors started to distance themselves from the walls of the abyss and gathered to the center.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the malicious Mu Ning would not have affected the martial artists too much.</p>

  <p>After all, they were tainted with malicious Mu Ning whenever they killed a creature. As the majority of them were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, the number of creatures who had died by their hands was too large a figure.</p>

  <p>But usually for the martial artists, the malicious Mu Ning in their bodies was within the range of their control. For the martial artists who practiced evil cultivation methods, it was a different case. They were required to kill more creatures in order to gather more malicious Mu Ning…</p>

  <p>When the malicious Mu Ning in them accumulated over time, inner demons and all sorts of demonic barriers appeared in their hearts. Especially, when one cultivated, it was easy for the cultivator to go wrong in his martial arts cultivation and spiral into madness.</p>

  <p>But because martial artists were used to living with their malicious Mu Ning, the one in the abyss should not have affected them much, even though it was strong. After all, the Mu Ning was not within their bodies. Facing its turbulence, many of the martial artists were a bit nervous, but they were not afraid.</p>

  <p>However, not long after, they discovered that they were completely wrong.</p>

  <p>As they continued their descent, the malicious Mu Ning in the abyss became increasingly thicker. At first, the blood-red light only flowed along the cracks in the walls of the abyss. But as everyone continued to fall, the malicious Mu Ning condensed into red specks of light that floated around the abyss.</p>

  <p>The specks of light could be seen everywhere. Even if the warriors gathered toward the center of the abyss, they could not avoid them. They kept colliding with Luo Zheng and the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Once someone came into physical contact with these red specks of light, the malicious Mu Ning would enter into the martial artist's body and be instantly absorbed…</p>

  <p>At first when they absorbed a few specks of light, the warriors did not feel anything. But as the number increased, they became more agitated.</p>

  <p>Their hearts beat wildly and they felt as if they wanted to tear everything around them into pieces.</p>
