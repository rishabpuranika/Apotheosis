</p>

  <p>The forms of the Other Shore creatures who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting had undergone a great change. Thus, as the "fox" traveled through the maze looking very similar to the others, they had taken her without doubt as one of their own.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's words raised everyone's suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Are you a beast of the scroll painting?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The fox stood nearby, and spoke in a disdainful tone. "That's the name given by you stupid creatures."</p>

  <p>As an intelligent being, she was very dissatisfied about being named a beast.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it doesn't matter," said the fox, giving a short laugh. "You are no different from the thousands of idiots who came before you. Like them, you will surely die."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she beckoned with her hand.</p>

  <p>The two Evil Orochis, which had been blocking the way out, slowly crawled in the passageway.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they were under her control.</p>

  <p>"Thousands... You've killed thousands of creatures?" Egan asked, raising an eyebrow in surprise.</p>

  <p>The fox smiled faintly. "Probably more, but I've forgotten the exact number."</p>

  <p>"Did you kill them with the help of the Evil Orochis? That's impossible.</p>

  <p>The Evil Orochi had only appeared a few times," said Kirk.</p>

  <p>According to the records of the Grand Plain Stage, the Evil Orochi had only appeared five times in known history. At the first time, it had killed all the creatures; on the other four occasions, some Other Shore creatures had survived by directly choosing to quit.</p>

  <p>The fox snorted. "You think I really need the Evil Orochi to kill you idiots?" she said sarcastically. "Use your head and search your memories. You must remember that your people had been all killed several times in the Eternal Scroll Painting."</p>

  <p>The test in the Eternal Scroll Painting was notoriously difficult. Many people gave up when they realized they could not survive, but many others chose to keep going and attempt to pass the test.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, it was not unusual for around thirty to fifty percent of those who entered to perish in the test. There were also rare occasions when not a single creature survived? all were killed for some unknown reason.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage were all afraid of the Evil Orochi and several other powerful beasts in the painting. But at least these beasts were known, because those who survived their encounters with them recorded their appearance and nature once they had left the Eternal Scroll Painting alive.</p>

  <p>However, there seemed to be one beast of the Eternal Scroll Painting who was absent from the records... because all who saw her were killed.</p>

  <p>Many of the Other Shore creatures were beginning to realize their peril.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" they asked, their voices trembling.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing you can do but await your death," said the fox calmly.</p>

  <p>"We'll kill you first!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>One of the creatures leapt out and rushed towards the fox.</p>

  <p>At the same instant that the creature approached, the fox's body dwindled then diminished altogether. Like a projection, she vanished then reappeared on top of her attacker.</p>

  <p>Before the creature knew what had happened, he was covered by the fox, who instantly slashed him into two.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could observe this scene from a more advanced perspective, he would see that this fox had instantly jumped out of the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. The fox flipped her hands in the air and crossed them on the second page, tearing that creature's painting apart.</p>

  <p>The painting of the creature ripped into two pieces instantly.</p>

  <p>"It's the ability of the Worm Tapir," Luo Zheng murmured, frowning.</p>

  <p>Others, including Egan and Kirk, had noticed the same thing.</p>

  <p>They had planned to rush forward to subdue the fox, but her strength and mode of attack were terrifying. Even if they all united and tried to attack a Worm Tapir at the same time, they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to win against it.</p>

  <p>"Who else is ready to die here?" the fox asked. Her figure was quickly returning to normal, until it was completely restored on the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"You are very powerful, and you can control the Evil Orochis. Why don't you just kill us directly?" Luo Zheng asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The two Evil Orochis had already had them cornered, under her control.</p>

  <p>If she had simply wanted to kill all of them, it would have been unnecessary for her to lead them all the way to the upper right corner of the maze.</p>

  <p>Those who heard Luo Zheng's question pricked up their ears, listening anxiously.</p>

  <p>Judging from how harshly the fox had spoken to them so far, they wondered what answer she would give, and knew it would be unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"It's too wasteful to let the Evil Orochis swallow you," the fox said casually.</p>

  <p>"There are still many 'beasts of scroll painting' you mentioned waiting for food..."</p>

  <p>With that, the fox turned and walked up the right corner of the passageway.</p>

  <p>Two Evil Orochis appeared from both sides, approaching the group of Other Shore creatures, whose skin tingled with dread.</p>

  <p>None wanted to follow the lead of the fox. However, the Evil Orochis limited their options. Maybe the fox would harm them, but the Evil Orochis would definitely kill them right now if they tried to retreat.</p>

  <p>Escorted by the watchful eyes of the Evil Orochis, everyone slowly followed the fox.</p>

  <p>They came to a stop when they saw that there were indeed some small beasts waiting at the end of the upper right corner. They looked like dogs.</p>

  <p>Some of the Other Shore creatures immediately recognized them.</p>

  <p>"Are those the Iron Dogs?"</p>

  <p>"They are!"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to feed us to them?"</p>

  <p>The Iron Dog was very common in the first page. Many of Other Shore creatures in the group had seen and killed these beasts, so they naturally recognized them at a glance.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" the fox said distractedly. She glanced back at them. "You're right, they're Iron Dogs. Very clever of you to recognize them so quickly."</p>

  <p>They didn't feel any pleasure at her praise.</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures had fallen silent. They had always been the great talents in the Grand Plain Stage, and even on the Other Shore. Now, for the first time, they were the prey? they were the ones facing defeat at the hands of a stronger opponent. They were entirely at the mercy of the fox.</p>

  <p>Black despair began filling their thoughts, and their hearts felt heavy with dread.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept moving forward very slowly, quietly observing everything around him.</p>

  <p>The end of the maze was comprised of squares, and many paths crisscrossed each other. At this point, however, every channel was blocked by the Evil Orochis, which prevented them from finding a way out.</p>

  <p>As they crossed another horizontal passageway, following the fox, Luo Zheng suddenly paused briefly, his eyes fixed on something in the distance.</p>

  <p>Two hexagram arrays were placed symmetrically on the right corner.</p>

  <p>"Egan," Luo Zheng whispered.</p>

  <p>Egan immediately followed Luo Zheng's gaze. Kirk and some other creatures also caught sight of the two arrays.</p>

  <p>In fact, there were a lot of hexagram arrays at the end of the maze. Two such arrays would appear after they passed through every three passages.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was thinking hard. The problem was that even if they managed to reach the arrays and regained their original forms, they still wouldn't be a match for the Evil Orochis who guarded them. No one had bothered to use that strategy against the Evil Orochis because it was no different from courting death.</p>

  <p>But the situation was getting desperate.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to be torn apart by the dogs and eaten as food.</p>

  <p>If the result was death either way, then it was better to die fighting than to wait passively to be killed.</p>

  <p>Many of the Other Shore creatures had reached the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>When they moved past the next passageway, two groups of creatures rushed out on both sides.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, several Other Shore creatures had stepped into the hexagram arrays. They finally returned to their original forms. Yet they wore grim expressions, for they knew that they were still outmatched by the formidable opponent.</p>

  <p>Still, they were also determined to put up a good fight. Regardless of the outcome, as long as they were in the arrays, they could at least fight with their real strength.</p>
