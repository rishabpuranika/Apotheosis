<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The martial arts of the Divine Land had existed for a long time and had gone through countless eras of development. However, it was now stuck in a bottleneck.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the level or achievement a divine citizen could reach was already defined after they were born. Moreover, their social strata was fixed and thus, rarely changed.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the chances of a small village like the Misty Mountain Village to have some powerful warriors were close to none.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Moon Village was naturally infuriated, but he had sharp eyes. He knew that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't an ordinary person and of course, secretly raised his vigilance. That was why he first asked Luo Luo Zheng where he learned martial arts from in order to find out more about his background.</p>

  <p>"My master?" Luo Luo Zheng flatly said and glanced at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at this person and said indifferently, "You don't have the right to know about this."</p>

  <p>The subordinates of the Sun Moon Village's leader began to curse Luo Luo Zheng among themselves once again when they heard his words.</p>

  <p>Just as they began to speak, Luo Luo Zheng threw the pebbles that were concealed in his fingers at lightning speed. Several swooshing sounds filled the air as the jaws of the martial artists who cursed Luo Luo Zheng had gotten shattered by the pebbles. They fell to the ground and rolled around in pain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the leader of the Sun Moon Village just stood there motionlessly. Even if Luo Luo Zheng hadn't moved yet, he knew that he was no match for this person. Since Luo Luo Zheng had refused to reveal where he had learned martial arts, he relented and said, "To be honest, my friend, our Sun Moon Village is doing favors for someone else! That person is definitely not someone you can afford to offend. Doing so for the sake of the Misty Mountain Village is surely not a wise choice!"</p>

  <p>When he was finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng paused in contemplation.</p>

  <p>It could be said that this leader of the Sun Moon Village was intelligent to some level. He wasn't like some extremely conceited and foolish people who looked for trouble with Luo Luo Zheng and wanted to kill him first.</p>

  <p>Since the leader said that they were doing things for someone else and that person was someone he couldn't afford to offend, then that person must be a powerful True God.</p>

  <p>There was still a huge difference between a world lord and a True God.</p>

  <p>However, to be able to bridge that gap would certainly feel like reaching the heaven from the earth. But, Luo Zheng's current strength did not allow him to have even the slightest chance of winning against a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Moreover, those black threads currently bound his cinnabar field, so it was even more impossible for him to compete against a True God.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Moon Village mentally snickered when he noticed the change in Luo Zheng's expression. 'This person hesitated. I'll push a little more so he would back off!' he thought.</p>

  <p>It was true that the leader of the Sun Moon Village worked for someone else, and that person was indeed powerful. At the very least, this person had once been one of the hegemons of the Vast Sky Region!</p>

  <p>The thirty-six islands and the seventy-two villages in the north of the Vast Sky Region had once belonged to this person. In addition, among his followers, there were even seven low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this person had suddenly disappeared a long time ago.</p>

  <p>There were no news of him in the last tens of divine eras. The thirty-six islands and seventy-two villages that he had previously managed had all collapsed and quickly disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were only three villages left, and the Sun Moon Village was one of them.</p>

  <p>However, the Sun Moon Village was now in a terrible state of decline.</p>

  <p>Their glory and legends were now a thing of the past, and even a small village like the Misty Mountain Village wasn't afraid of them anymore.</p>

  <p>If it had been back then then, not even the divine cities of Vast Sky Region dared to look down on the seventy-two villages and thirty-six islands, let alone a remote mountain village!</p>

  <p>Then again, the leader of the Sun Moon Village had recently seen an enormous opportunity?</p>

  <p>That powerful person had come back.</p>

  <p>Once that person had fully returned, he would definitely regain his former glory. Such would be the leader of the Sun Moon Village's golden chance.</p>

  <p>Of course, if it wasn't for the fact that the Sun Moon Village was one of the 72 villages, he wouldn't be qualified or it would be impossible to speak to that person. Another reason was that this powerful person felt nostalgic, so he gave the leader of the Sun Moon Village such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, not even his title of a proving godly warrior meant anything, as it was just a sugarcoated term for world lord. Many divine citizens had reached the level of world lords since the ancient times, but the number of martial artists who could cultivate the Divine Dao was extremely small.</p>

  <p>If that powerful person truly valued him, then it wouldn't be hard for him to cultivate a Divine Dao in the future!</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Moon Village thought that even if Luo Luo Zheng was indeed extraordinary and most likely came from a powerful background, or even a wealthy Floating Island--he was still no match for that person.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the leader of the Sun Moon Village didn't want that powerful person to look down on himself. Then again, how would he gain that person's favor in the future if he couldn't complete such a small mission?</p>

  <p>"Besides... We are just taking back our territory," the leader of the Sun Moon Village added.</p>

  <p>The villagers of the Misty Mountain Village who had been hiding in their houses couldn't hold themselves any longer when they heard those words. They had decided to just hide and watch the situation from a distance, but they couldn't do that anymore after all those insults. After all, they were the aboriginals of the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>"Our Misty Mountain Village is your territory?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Our Misty Mountain villagers have been here for generations. You are too shameless to have said that!"</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the leader of the Sun Moon Village just smiled at their words and said, "For generations? How many years do you refer to? As far as I know, it has only been less than a divine era since your people moved here. And this place was indeed our territory seven divine eras ago--or more exactly, it should be that person's territory!"</p>

  <p>While a divine citizen's lifespan certainly wasn't short, a single divine era was considered already very long, not to mention seven divine eras.</p>

  <p>"Seven divine eras? Why didn't you say a hundred?"</p>

  <p>"This kind of thing has no way to be verified. It's just your side of the story!"</p>

  <p>"I can also say that a hundred divine eras ago, our Misty Mountain Village's ancestors also built a village here! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The villagers of Misty Mountain Village shot back.</p>

  <p>Despite all the mocking retorts and jeers, the leader of the Sun Moon Village just sneered at them. "It's impossible for you all to not have heard of the legend of the 36 islands and 72 villages. I'm telling you, that person is already back. Whether you believe it or not is up to you!" he warned.</p>

  <p>Back when that powerful person first appeared in the Sun Moon Village, the village leader himself did not believe it as well. He thought that he was someone who only existed in ancient legends.</p>

  <p>But even if the legend might be fake, this person's power couldn't be faked at all. That person was as strong as a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Silence immediately enveloped the Misty Mountain Village at the leader of the Sun Moon Village's words. However, they whispered among themselves, and their murmurs did not escape Luo Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>"About the thirty-six islands and seventy-two villages, I remember that there is indeed such a legend in the Vast Sky Region. Our Misty Mountain Village belongs to one of these regions."</p>

  <p>"Hmph, that is just a story someone has made up. A few divine eras ago?</p>

  <p>Will anyone even believe the things that have been passed down from such a long time ago?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that person is the infamous Master Evil. It's just that according to the legends, he had died a long time ago, and those villages and islands have been destroyed as well."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The whispers were barely audible, but Luo Luo Zheng still heard them all. He couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, his lips twitched. A glimmer of confidence flashed in his eyes when he heard the words "Master Evil".</p>

  <p>He stared at the leader of the Sun Moon Village and asked, "The person you're talking about, is he really Master Evil?"</p>

  <p>As for Master Evil's return, the leader of the Sun Moon Village hadn't found the right time to announce it to the public. At the very least, he did not plan to reveal it until he had helped Master Evil obtain the thing that he had buried under Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>Now that some people had already guessed who the person was, the leader of the Sun Moon Village chuckled as he assumed that Luo Luo Zheng was frightened. He thought that it would be best if Luo Luo Zheng would be wary of the overwhelming odds against him and just back off. He then continued,</p>

  <p>"Master Evil is now a mid-rank True God. If he personally comes here, you won't have any chance to resist and you will definitely die. Those villagers will also suffer from an unimaginable disaster. You should convince them to leave with you as quickly as you can!"</p>
