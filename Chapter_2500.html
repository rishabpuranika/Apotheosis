<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to worry even after entering the sea of fire.</p>

  <p>The sun looked like a tiny fireball from afar, but it was massive from within.</p>

  <p>Zheng had relied on a flying sword to wander in the sea of fire at a snail-like pace.</p>

  <p>At this rate, it would take a long time to find the palace.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the whale was swimming at a speed that was many times faster than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>After he was sucked into the belly for several hours, the gigantic whale swam for quite a long distance and finally took him to his destination.</p>

  <p>It was a blessing in disguise.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart beat faster as he looked up at the towering golden palace.</p>

  <p>But he did not hesitate. The flying sword under his feet moved upward and then towards the palace.</p>

  <p>The palace looked to be nearby, given Zheng's vantage point, but it took him close to an hour to get close to it.</p>

  <p>"What a magnificent palace!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as he stood at the door of the palace, looking up at it in awe.</p>

  <p>The entire palace shone with a golden light. He didn't know what metal it was made of, but he was sure that it was definitely not gold. The soft metal would have long turned into liquid under the high temperatures surrounding it.</p>

  <p>He then controlled the flying sword so that he floated into the palace through the open door.</p>

  <p>The first part of the palace was also immersed in the sea of fire. But once he had moved forward for a distance, Zheng noticed that several mysterious array textures had appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>A curtain of faint yellow light spread out of the textures, blocking the sea of flames.</p>

  <p>'This light is almost the same as the light released by the Sun-resisting Umbrella!'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought, his eyebrows going up in surprise.</p>

  <p>So when he approached the light curtain with the Sun-resisting Umbrella, the two light curtains connected to each other.</p>

  <p>This allowed Zheng to go in without resistance.</p>

  <p>"That was easy!" Zheng murmured in surprise.</p>

  <p>The palace had used the light curtain to create large, safe space.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in the palace, looking around as he carefully removed the Sun-resisting Umbrella. There was no burning sensation. That was how he knew that this place was safe.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng remained vigilant.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of creatures in the sea of fire. It was possible that there was something odd in the palace.</p>

  <p>As he walked through the palace's huge corridor, he used his spiritual sense to gauge what was happening around him.</p>

  <p>The palace looked luxurious but was empty from within.</p>

  <p>He crossed the corridor, went through three rooms, and finally came to the center of the palace.</p>

  <p>Seven interconnected rings were etched on the ground. And when he looked up, he saw that similar rings were present above him.</p>

  <p>"Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he walked over and stepped on to the ring at the center.</p>

  <p>Apart from being wary of the presence of a few ferocious creatures, he was not worried about this being a trap.</p>

  <p>The sun was, after all, an extremely powerful barrier. And according to Harper, the Sun-resisting Umbrella was a key with which one could move easily through the sun. But without this key, not even a Holy Being could enter it.</p>

  <p>Naturally, there was no need to set any other trap.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng stepped into the center, the seven rings beneath his feet began to glow.</p>

  <p>With a telltale buzz, the ring at the center floated up to surround Zheng's waist.</p>

  <p>The other rings came over Zheng's feet and hands, and two rings piled on top of his head.</p>

  <p>"What are these?"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered, puzzled. .</p>

  <p>As the seven rings settled into place, the two rings above his head began to vibrate again.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt his soul connect closely with these rings.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a white light exploded in his mind, flashing ominously like lightning.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes again, he saw something floating before him.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at the oval-shaped, gem-like thing floating in the air.</p>

  <p>He stared at it for a long time, growing more surprised by the minute. He could hardly believe it.</p>

  <p>"This is the divine land!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to the rings, Zheng's vision had seemed to become all-encompassing. He could actually see the entirety of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land itself was unimaginably vast, spanning tens of trillions of miles from its easternmost point to its westernmost.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't clearly see the details of the divine land. It was an oval shaped gem that emitted a white luster.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful!"</p>

  <p>Zheng gasped as he stared at this scene, stunned.</p>

  <p>After a long while, he turned to look at the other side.</p>

  <p>Pieces of giant brown clouds floated around the gem. These clouds were about a hundred times larger than the divine land.</p>

  <p>"The chaotic energy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was familiar with the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of chaotic energy in his own inner world. Besides, he had once seen Bromley's tourist records in the fairy palace. The images Bromley had recorded were exactly the same as what was happening in front of him.</p>

  <p>At the time, Zheng didn't have an accurate concept of chaotic energy. All he knew was that the chaos was filled with a large mass of giant brown clouds. He didn't know how large these clouds were because there wasn't anything for comparison.</p>

  <p>But now that he could see the divine land and compare the two, Zheng knew how huge the clouds formed by the chaotic energy actually were.</p>

  <p>He looked around for a while before returning his gaze to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down and noticed that there were still small black dots on the surface of the divine land.</p>

  <p>There were not many, only about fifty to sixty of them.</p>

  <p>"These dots look small, but they are actually huge. They are attached to the surface of the divine land. I think they are the universes of Holy Beings," Zheng said to himself.</p>

  <p>From where he was standing, he could see the Evolutionary Universe, but could not tell which Holy Beings the other universes belonged to.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze continued to travel down. It bypassed the divine land to finally find a grey world.</p>

  <p>"Is that the bottom of the chaos?" Zheng was shocked.</p>

  <p>Harold, his mother, and Harper all had the same opinion about the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land was falling rapidly.</p>

  <p>And according to what Zheng was seeing right now, it was true.</p>

  <p>Under the divine land was a greyish white world, where the slender bones of beasts stood vertically like the fiends' teeth.</p>

  <p>Each bone was as long as the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>It was hard for Zheng to imagine how huge these beasts had been when they were alive.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the divine land was huge and was where bones were buried.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this place?"</p>
