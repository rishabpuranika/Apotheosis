<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3448 The Principle Of Construction </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>During those times when Zheng was staying in the Oneness Sky Palace, he didn't spend much time understanding the Truth Enlightenment. In any case, his comprehension speed was not that fast.</p>

  <p>But right now, it was impossible for him to leave this place without thoroughly comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Knowing that this was a crucial process, Zheng calmed himself down and decided to complete this task as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Days turned into a week while Zheng was concentrating hard on his task.</p>

  <p>Before long, twenty one days had already passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng poured his whole heart and soul into mastering the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. He tirelessly worked on it all day and all night.</p>

  <p>After six weeks, Zheng was already able to recite more than 12, 000 words smoothly and effortlessly.</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the enchanting woman visited Zheng every once in a while. They were surprised by his comprehension speed.</p>

  <p>Even though they were both talented, it took them much longer to comprehend the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Properly speaking, the time they spent mastering it was one and a half years and two years, respectively.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was already able to master ninety percent of it in just a month and a half. It was an incredible thing to witness.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was composed of 14, 000 words.</p>

  <p>Based on Zheng's current speed, it wouldn't take him three months to comprehend all of it.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Zheng's comprehension speed was even faster than the two of them had ever imagined. This man was truly remarkable.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the eighty-third day, Zheng had recited the last word.</p>

  <p>Finally, it was done!</p>

  <p>He clasped his hands together and a red light appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Then, he lightly tapped the air with his finger and a blue light materialized.</p>

  <p>He flipped his palm upwards and a yellow light emerged.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The three lights began to converge and formed a mass of black energy.</p>

  <p>He proceeded to release the energy. With a loud crash, the golden wall that surrounded him collapsed.</p>

  <p>With a clinking sound, the golden words carved into the wall had broken one after another.</p>

  <p>"The principle of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction is similar to that of the chaotic energy. It allows the user to construct things directly out of the void.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, however, no one is able to use the chaotic energy for construction. At most, void construction can only be completed within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction has shattered this limit!</p>

  <p>Materialize!" Zheng exclaimed as he watched the mass of energy in front of him.</p>

  <p>The surface of the black energy was constantly changing until it transformed into a rod. A wave-like energy twirled on the surface of the black rod. The energy began to solidify until it turned into a dragon circling around the rod.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Finally, both the dragon and the rod had changed into a magnificent golden color. Zheng actually managed to make a dragon rod out of the void!</p>

  <p>He grabbed the rod and waved it around to assess its functionality. As of now, it felt a little flimsy. However, it would be much more solid with the energy Zheng instilled in it.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had been waiting outside for a long time. When they saw the collapse of the golden wall, they immediately understood that Zheng had already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. A big smile appeared upon their faces as they approached Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! You have already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction in less than three months," No. 9527 exclaimed delightedly.</p>

  <p>The pure power of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was strong when used in the way of energy. Naturally, it would be extremely useful for Zheng. Most importantly, he could easily return to this space by using this Truth of Godly Way!</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the enchanting woman also went towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>They came at the right time as Zheng had just recited the final word.</p>

  <p>They had already anticipated that Zheng would be able to succeed soon.</p>

  <p>However, they were dumbfounded when they saw the dragon rod he made out of the three lights. Once again, he had exceeded their expectations.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed the looks of astonishment upon their faces. "What's the matter?</p>

  <p>Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked them curiously.</p>

  <p>"Y-you," stammered the handsome man, "you are capable of void construction?" The handsome man pointed at the dragon rod in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>He was clearly taken aback.</p>

  <p>Zheng swung the rod lightly and the three energies moved along the rod. They converged at the end of the rod and turned into a diamond-shaped spear tip which glinted and revealed a sharp edge. "Well, I've already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Needless to say, I am capable of void construction. What's the problem?"</p>

  <p>"But, but..." The enchanting woman couldn't believe her eyes either. "We mastered it long ago but we are still unable to create anything!"</p>

  <p>The handsome man stared at Zheng as though he was a monster. "I can do it, but..." His voice trailed off as he contemplated upon this.</p>

  <p>His talent was slightly greater than that of the enchanting woman. He was capable of void construction. However, the things he made were too horrible to look at. They were nowhere near the dragon rod Zheng created.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why they could not believe that Zheng was capable of void construction already. To them, it was unbelievable that he accomplished this soon after he just finished comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>The two of them left in a hurry as soon as they realized there was something seriously strange about Zheng. Even though King Manard had only been in seclusion for a short time, he had already ordered them to wake him up after Zheng comprehended the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not bothered by their reaction. He continued assessing his new power.</p>

  <p>With a gentle pinch of his hand, the dragon rod split in the middle.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Three-Energy Construction appears very powerful. However, it doesn't seem strong enough yet. It won't be of much use in actual combat," the Regal Jade Spirit commented truthfully.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 nodded in agreement. "It does look impressive but it lacks real worth."</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed lost in thought for just a moment. Finally, he said, "Hmm. It doesn't seem right. As the name suggests, the three kinds of energy represent the original sources of things. With enough energy, one will be able to create the same things. However, it takes a long time and requires too much energy."</p>

  <p>Ages ago, King Manard had already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. This meant that he should have had a corresponding theurgy as well. However, it seemed like he didn't have the intention of teaching Zheng the theurgy, so he didn't ask him for it. In any case, he thought he could just study it on his own if he had spare time.</p>

  <p>King Manard had only been in seclusion for less than three months.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he was both confused and angry when his two disciples awakened him. He wasn't expecting to be woken up this early.</p>

  <p>Only after his two disciples reported to him did he finally understand what was happening. Zheng had successfully comprehended the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>"It only took him two months and twenty-three days, to be exact," the handsome man informed King Manard with his life vitality. "Moreover, he is capable of void construction as soon as he has comprehended it!"</p>

  <p>King Manard's eyes widened in surprise. This was completely unexpected to him as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the first person that had broken into this space for a long, long time. In the eyes of King Manard, Zheng was only a representative. He had hoped that Zheng would find the humans on the Other Shore and tell them the news of this place.</p>

  <p>He did not take Zheng's talent seriously. Now, it was clear that Zheng was actually much more powerful than he imagined.</p>

  <p>Concern was written all over his face. Together with his two disciples, he hurried over to where Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still discussing the functions of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction with No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit when King Manard arrived. He seemed a bit flustered.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, King Manard," said Zheng as he bowed his head slightly.</p>

  <p>King Manard immediately noticed the broken dragon rod and stared at it.</p>

  <p>"Kindly show me your ability of void construction." He gestured to Zheng imploringly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and held out his hand. The energies of three colors gathered once more and converged before changing into a dark color. Soon after, a long shimmering silver sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>As King Manard examined the long sword, he could barely keep his astonishment from reflecting in his eyes. "There are three stages of void construction. The first stage is Looking Alike in Appearance. The things created in this stage look impressive; however, they lack real worth," he said carefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right." Zheng nodded. "This sword absolutely looks splendid but it is actually useless."</p>
