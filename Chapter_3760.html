  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had naturally thought of many ways to communicate with the creatures outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>Like most other civilizations, they wanted to gain rich experience so they could decipher Sanskrit words, the light dots, and even their voices.</p>

  <p>Sanskrit words were the text; the light dots were the form; and the voices were the verbal expression.</p>

  <p>Among the three of them, the words were the easiest to decipher. Every ruling civilization that had passed through the chaos had done profound studies on the Sanskrit words, and the Element Spirit Civilization was no exception.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult to decipher the form and the verbal expression. For instance, the creatures in the chaos weren't capable of entering the Abstruse Energy World, which was their innate limitation.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was possible to break such a limitation.</p>

  <p>For example, Ziya gradually adapted to the rules of the Abstruse Energy World after countless years of exploration.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, that way of adapting was quite inefficient, and that was why Ziya still couldn't exit a mountain even after so many years.</p>

  <p>Then again, his explorations were only one individual's efforts. As the oldest civilization, the Element Spirit Civilization had many talents in the Element Spirit race, who when they explored together, could surely find out more about the Abstruse Energy World than he did.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Element Spirit Civilization even knew how to fight and set traps.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had captured a considerable number of creatures in the Abstruse Energy World just to understand how the civilizations there worked.</p>

  <p>All the creatures they had captured from the Abstruse Energy World were brought to the Other Shore and detained in the Cold Prisons.</p>

  <p>They built the Cold Prisons in such a way that their temperature was always at an immensely low level. Not only were the Cold Prisons very suitable for holding creatures from outside the chaos, but they also helped the Element Spirit race study them.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, they also made a series of detailed plans to capture those creatures, but they never got to carry out those plans smoothly.</p>

  <p>Many people from the Element Spirit Civilization died in the Abstruse Energy World during their first attempts.</p>

  <p>That was because the Element Spirit Civilization was not good at fighting in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>After some careful consideration, they changed the strategies of their plans.</p>

  <p>They might not be able to defeat those creatures in the Abstruse Energy World, but they believed that they could defeat them on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If they set up a bait, they could gradually lure the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World to the Other Shore. The moment those creatures arrived at the Other Shore, the people of the Element Spirit Civilization would surround and capture them.</p>

  <p>Although it was a despicable method, it was quite useful.</p>

  <p>They eventually carried out the plan and as a result, the number of creatures in the Cold Prisons began to increase rapidly.</p>

  <p>But even after the Element Spirit Civilization studied them for a long time, they still weren't satisfied.</p>

  <p>The reason was that the trap that the Element Spirit Civilization had set up was rather simple. It consisted of just putting food as bait in the Abstruse Energy World and luring those creatures with it.</p>

  <p>Then, almost all the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World who were fooled by the food bait were low-level.</p>

  <p>Those creatures did not possess intelligence. Aside from their fighting instinct and strange howls, they were useless. It was even more impossible to learn about any civilization in the Abstruse Energy World by studying them.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the Element Spirit race couldn't find a better way. In the end, there was nothing they could do except setting up the traps in a more sophisticated way.</p>

  <p>Finally, one day, a bait had attracted a member of the Colossus race, and that creature accidentally fell into the Element Spirit Civilization's trap.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be the bald giant, and the whole Element Spirit Civilization was in an uproar at the capture.</p>

  <p>Even though the Element Spirit Civilization pursued a very conservative way, which was the Purge Way, they were always eager to know more about the world outside the chaos. They wanted to use the Purge Way to delay the end of the chaos as much as possible and at the same time, they wanted to explore the Abstruse Energy World to find another method of ending.</p>

  <p>After a long time, they finally caught an intelligent member of the Colossus race. How could they not be excited?</p>

  <p>Their excitement faded when even after two years of imprisonment, the Element Spirit Civilization didn't get anything out of the bald giant. They hadn't even understood his language.</p>

  <p>Still, the bald giant hadn't been in prison for a long time yet, so most of the Element Spirit race was still optimistic.</p>

  <p>They believed that they would get the information they needed sooner or later, as long as the bald giant was in prison.</p>

  <p>Yet, they never imagined that Zheng would release the bald giant purely out of a series of coincidences! "You... You can talk to this bald giant?" Hosea asked Zheng in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Zheng only shrugged and didn't say yes or no.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" Horsea shouted.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his whole body turned into an azure flying shuttle and charged straight towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Before he could reach the ice wall, a huge fist fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant smashed Hosea to the ground with a loud crunch.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fist touched the ground, a visible shock wave formed around it. The shock wave swept over the ice walls, ice castles, and ice crystal buildings, and all of them were crushed into bits.</p>

  <p>More than half of the ice city was destroyed like that!</p>

  <p>"My ruler!"</p>

  <p>"The fist of the bald giant is truly powerful..."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Master Hosea is all right..."</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures and Five-Element Slaves who witnessed the scene became worried and panicked.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, all of them sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Wisps of white frost spiraled up along the bald giant's fist. As the white frost condensed, it turned into a thick layer of ice and wrapped around the giant fist.</p>

  <p>Hosea's face was on the bald giant's arm, but the face was looking at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ha, did you think you would win by releasing this guy?"</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The cold air quickly spread to the bald giant's torso, legs, neck, head.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the ice had frozen the bald giant on the spot and rendered him motionless.</p>

  <p>Hosea slipped out of the bald giant's arm and stared coldly at Zheng. "Tell me, how did you communicate with him?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng was a little shocked at the sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>If the bald giant really didn't have any other ability, he probably shouldn't have broken into the ice city.</p>

  <p>When Hosea saw that Zheng didn't say anything, he jumped up once again. He stretched both of his hands, which held two curved wing-like blades, then flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment he jumped, a shattering sound came from behind him. The giant hand once again grabbed him.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A cracking sound came from the bald giant's palm. Hosea's body was crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's face didn't relax when he heard the sound.</p>

  <p>It was because he knew that the Element Spirit race evolved from various elements, so it wasn't easy to kill them.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Chill Ice Slaves and the Moon Fire Slaves had spiritual cores. If their spiritual cores were damaged, they would die. On the other hand, the Magical Thunder Slaves had no spiritual cores, and the bald giant couldn't seem to kill them.</p>

  <p>Since Hosea was a water spirit among the spirits with five elements, it was impossible to kill him with just violence.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Zheng's prediction became true.</p>

  <p>Wisps of white frost spread out from the bald giant's palm once again, turned into thick ice, and tightly wrapped around his body.</p>
