<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1641 Who Is That Woman (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>But in an instant, ice crystals formed on Yudie's face. The ice crystals were arranged with certain distance from each other, forming a special protective layer of life vitality.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The knife-like force hit the ice crystals instead. The explosion was so strong that the ice crystals cracked open revealing Yudie's fuming face.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie could regenerate her body from any damage. But that kind of strong explosion would have given her quite a damage and it would take a while before she could recover. She was grateful for the protection of the ice crystals because if not for those, her face would have been cut open.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie suddenly stood up; her face full of rage as she stared at the middle-aged woman not far away from her.</p>

  <p>Although she served here by pouring her life vitality into the Illusion Space of the Pure Jade Sacred Place for free, she was not a slave.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman who attacked her with a whip looked at Ning Yudie with a cold smile. "I already said it before; no one is allowed to speak here. But here you are making the same mistake over and over again! For now, this whip served as a warning. If there's a next time, it won't be just this whip anymore."</p>

  <p>"We were only discussing in a low voice and it did not affect us pouring our life vitality into the Illusion Space. Just so you know, there are also other people talking here aside from me! Why are you always targeting me?" Ning Yudie asked in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman pinched the whip in her hand, and a disdainful smile appeared on her face. "The people around you, eh? Let me remind you of who you are. You are just a warrior from the Lower World. What qualifications do you think you have to compare yourself to others? A bitch like you� "</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, a black broken blade came spiraling over. The speed of this broken blade was extremely fast, and it was almost unavoidable.</p>

  <p>It flashed several times in the air and before the middle-aged woman could react, it had instantly cut off her right arm.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman let out a scream like a pig being butchered as blood spurted from her freshly severed arm.</p>

  <p>The other warriors pouring their life vitality into the Illusion Space witnessed what happened, but their expressions didn't change much.</p>

  <p>Instead of rushing to the middle-aged woman's aid, they just stood to see what would happen next with rapt attention.</p>

  <p>To a warrior, losing an arm was not a rare occurrence. However, it wasn't common for a warrior to hurt another one in this place. For someone to dare hurt the middle-aged woman, it only meant that the person must have a very high status in the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>After all, the Saint Lord of the sacred place was present at that moment to observe the pyramid above the Illusion Space, so there was no way an ordinary warrior would make a move here. It would be like signing their own death.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? What did I do wrong?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman held onto her wound with a bewildered expression on her face. She was a smart woman who knew that whoever attacked her here was not someone she could afford to offend.</p>

  <p>It was just that she hadn't done anything wrong, so why did that someone have to break her arm? Why?</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman could only ask the warrior because she was not convinced that she deserved to be punished like this.</p>

  <p>Soon, a person walked out of the space. This person was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, and many warriors could recognize him. He was Preston, a palace leader of the Pure Jade Sacred Place. He could be considered one of the top 100 ranked figures of the sacred place.</p>

  <p>"I cut off one of your arms just to warn you. Don't be so rude again,"</p>

  <p>Preston said with a cold expression. He then turned to look at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>When his eyes met hers, a gentle smile crossed his lips. His cold face immediately disappeared without a trace as if he had met the bright sun.</p>

  <p>"Are you Ning Yudie Ning?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was astonished. She had not yet recovered from seeing the middle-aged woman's arm being cut off, and now this? This man was far superior than the middle-aged woman and his cultivation was unfathomable, so why was he being so polite to her?</p>

  <p>Ever since she had ascended to the Upper World, she had been looked down upon. She had received all sorts of unfair treatment that had left her feeling extremely regretful. If she had known earlier that a Soul Sea Realm warrior meant nothing in the Upper World, she would not have ascended.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," she answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind coming with me?" Preston asked politely. He was still wearing that gentle smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie felt strange and it could be seen on her face, but she still nodded slightly. "Of course. But I still need to infuse my life vitality into the Illusion Space."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to. Please, if you could just follow me," Preston said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Ning Yudie immediately left this place and followed Preston's lead.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw Preston personally lead Ning Yudie away. Naturally, when Preston and Ning Yudie had finally left, they all began to talk about her.</p>

  <p>"Who is that woman? Why is Master Preston so nice to her?"</p>

  <p>"Well, come to think of it, she's a real beauty. I bet that some big shot from the Pure Jade Sacred Place has taken a fancy to her!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so! If mere beauty could take us anywhere, then why are there single beauties still working here?"</p>

  <p>As for the middle-aged woman, she stared as Ning Yudie slowly disappeared from her sight. She was left grabbing onto her amputated arm, gritting her teeth in pain and rage.</p>
