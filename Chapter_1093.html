<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1093 Zheng's Turn To Fight (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At her words, Bram's face flashed with hostility.</p>

  <p>In addition to the royal family, there was also a large secret sect in the York Divine Kingdom. The Holy Maiden was the most important person in the sect, and her status was as high as that of the crown prince in the York Divine Kingdom. Sometimes what she said was even more useful than the words of the crown prince himself.</p>

  <p>After all, if the crown prince wanted to ascend to the throne, he would first have to wait for his father to abdicate himself, or worse yet, die.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had to step into the Soul Sea Realm before he was allowed to take on the throne. It would take thousands or even ten thousand years before his father abdicated, and it was very difficult for him to reach the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, if a woman was chosen to be a Holy Maiden by the secret sect, she would be able to command the secret sect of the York Divine Kingdom and would possess an extraordinary status.</p>

  <p>Bram smiled coldly and once again looked at Luo Zheng. Although he didn't believe that Luo Zheng could defeat Logan, he didn't want anyone to think that there was no powerful martial artist in his kingdom either.</p>

  <p>"Who said that no one in my kingdom can fight?" Bram suddenly asked coldly. He then turned his head and told Luo Zheng who was standing in the square, "Tianxing Luo, fight for me!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng suddenly heard Bram call out his name, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. His gaze landed on Randy. Randy slightly shook his head while Luo Zheng slightly nodded his head but did not reply.</p>

  <p>Lots of martial artists were standing in the square. They had never heard of this name, so they didn't know who the crown prince was calling out.</p>

  <p>Moreover, no one replied, making them feel even weirder. What was the prince doing?</p>

  <p>Who was Tianxing Luo? Was he a newly born talent of the Harlen Divine Kingdom? Regardless of who this person was, why hadn't he stepped up? Could it be that even the crown prince couldn't order him about?</p>

  <p>When Bram saw Luo Zheng standing there without showing any intentions of moving, his face flashed with a dark red color, and his eyes got filled with anger. He had just given Luo Zheng a chance to show off his strength, but Luo Zheng hadn't responded. How arrogant he was!</p>

  <p>The three Soul Sea Realm masters from the Jade Martial House knew what was going on since they were standing on the steps and could see into the crowd. They were well aware of Tianxing's character and also knew that both the crown prince and Randy had tried to win over him, and the crown prince had failed.</p>

  <p>Turner was also confused. No one had given him any information about Tianxing. He asked in confusion, "Bram, who is Tianxing Luo?"</p>

  <p>Bram was about to speak, but Randy answered first. He knew that it was time for him to speak. "Father, Tianxing is my friend. He's a new talent in the Jade Martial House. He is not the slightest bit weaker than Gregory or Edwin. Even I'm unable to defeat him."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Turner's face lit up. "Really?"</p>

  <p>"It's absolutely true. I'll invite him to fight now." Randy glanced at Bram with a smile on his face. He then turned towards Luo Zheng and asked in a clear voice, "My dear brother Tianxing, I'll leave this fight to you!"</p>

  <p>Everyone who was present there looked at each other in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the status of martial artists was decided by their strength, but the strength of the royal family was a different story. After all, the large divine kingdom had to ensure its own dignity. How could Randy call an ordinary martial artist 'brother'? Even the crown prince had called Tianxing by his full name.</p>

  <p>This was why Turner's face showed a hint of displeasure at the sentence but he didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng put on a smile. Actually, when he had seen Logan display his skills, he knew that he would have to fight him sooner or later.</p>

  <p>With a light flash, he suddenly jumped out from the crowd and slowly floated towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"He's just a martial artist at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm! Interesting. Doesn't the Harlen Divine Kingdom have some other stronger martial artists to fight for itself? I think they do. Look, there is still a large group of people below there who are at the later stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. They all must be stronger than this guy. He's just entered the middle stage of this realm!"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of him before. Where is he from?"</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy is a man of sagacity. Since he believes that this person is strong enough, I'm sure he really has some skills!"</p>

  <p>"So what? Compared to all Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists, Logan is basically invincible. What can this guy do? After all, this Tianxing is only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. I bet he can't take even a single blow from Logan."</p>

  <p>When the martial artists on the square saw that Luo Zheng was just at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, they began to discuss among themselves animatedly. They all thought that the Harlen Divine Kingdom didn't have any stronger martial artists, so Luo Zheng had been dispatched.</p>

  <p>At this moment, many of the powerful martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm also had weird looks on their faces.</p>

  <p>The crown prince had recommended Luo Zheng, but Luo Zheng hadn't responded.</p>

  <p>After Randy had successfully invited Luo Zheng, Turner had an expectant look on his face. But once he realized that Luo Zheng had just reached the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was quite disappointed.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom was staring at Luo Zheng with a puzzled expression too.</p>
