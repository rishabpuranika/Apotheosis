  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hallet, Gus!"</p>

  <p>Zheng yelled when he saw them, bowing to both.</p>

  <p>Hallet responded immediately, "Zheng, how have you been?"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Augustus had had a very close relationship before.</p>

  <p>He leaned forward, took a good look at him, and stretched his head out to smell his scent. "Zheng, which stage of the Other Shore Realm have you reached by now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng said, "Huh. Which stage of the Other Shore Realm I'm at..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how to answer this question.</p>

  <p>He'd been in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, but he hadn't fused with an Other Shore Token in that stage. The levels of the Other Shore Tokens he had with him weren't very high.</p>

  <p>It might not be accurate to say that he was at the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm, but it was a fact that he was at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>"I'm at the twentieth stage of the Other Shore Realm!" Augustus said.</p>

  <p>"Since the Mysterious Yellow Tower was destroyed, I haven't obtained the Other Shore Token yet, but much to my luck, I've fused with a holy armor from the nineteenth floor," he continued, seemingly proud of himself.</p>

  <p>He showed them the Other Shore Token as proof.</p>

  <p>It appeared on him, causing a blue light to radiate from his body. The aura released by the holy armor was quite captivating. It looked as if it held a strong, mysterious power.</p>

  <p>"It's an Other Shore Token of the mysterious type, isn't it?" Zheng said, studying the token with his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Augustus said confidently. It was obvious he was very proud of his possession. "Do you want to have a try? But you better watch yourself.</p>

  <p>Even if you have infinite power, you won't be able to defeat me!"</p>

  <p>Augustus jested.</p>

  <p>"Augustus, Zheng's just returned. Give him a break," Bromley said, embarrassed at the behavior of his disciple. He always knew Augustus had something special in him, but sometimes, he did act like a complete idiot.</p>

  <p>Hallet also looked at Augustus with a disapproving gaze. 'He's too haughty for his own good, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Augustus, however, paid no attention to their reminders and stares. He had been waiting to battle Zheng once he returned for too long.</p>

  <p>Zheng had the extremely formidable power, but Augustus wasn't ready to give up his challenge just yet.</p>

  <p>"Augustus, if you so badly want to battle with me, then let your request be my command," Zheng said, smiling smugly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the armor Augustus is wearing is extremely powerful. Even Tianming wouldn't be able to break from it if he were trapped by it. No matter how powerful you are, you won't be able to do anything to free yourself from its hold," Hallet reminded, worried.</p>

  <p>Even though he knew Augustus was definitely no match for Zheng, he still didn't want Zheng to take any chances.</p>

  <p>However, before Zheng could respond, Augustus charged at him. "Zheng! "Be careful!" Hallet yelled through the noise.</p>

  <p>Streaks of blue light outlined the holy armor, making Augustus appear like a fast, radiating figure. As he waved his hands in the air, two semicircular blue spaces shot from his palms, attacking Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens in the Mysterious Yellow Tower were carefully chosen by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. Almost every floor had a unique Other Shore Token. The holy armor was one of them. If one were trapped in the armor's blue spaces, they wouldn't be able to escape, falling into a constant cycle. No one was able to free themselves from it, not even Tianming.</p>

  <p>Little did Augustus know that Zheng could use the power of the ancestry-level bloodline at will.</p>

  <p>As soon as Augustus' spaces came charging at him, Zheng had already analyzed the type of the space power and figured out a way to deal with it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The two semicircular spaces gathered together, locking Zheng between them.</p>

  <p>"What will our precious little Zheng do to get out of this trap?" Augustus said mockingly and laughed proudly.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out his finger, and from it came a transparent spiral of power. With a quick move, he swept the spaces, completely slicing them with just the tip of his finger.</p>

  <p>He tore the holy armor's mysterious, blue spaces so easily as if he had simply torn a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>Augustus looked at him, his mouth hanging wide open.</p>

  <p>With the amount of power Zheng held, Augustus knew Zheng would be able to deal with the holy armor accordingly, but he didn't expect it to be that easy for him!</p>

  <p>He was standing face-to-face with someone who was able to break not only the holy armor of the nineteenth stage of the Other Shore, but also the theurgies of the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Grandmaster of Heaven!</p>

  <p>Tianming, who was standing a few meters away, walked up to Zheng, cupped his hands together, and with equal excitement said, "Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Tianming!" Zheng cheered out.</p>

  <p>The two of them shared a profound look.</p>

  <p>There was a special and unbreakable bond between them. They were both talents from the Evolutionary Universe. They experienced the lows and highs of life together. They'd basically known each other for most of their lives! Their friendship was very precious to them. It wasn't something one could easily encapsulate in words.</p>

  <p>When Tianming obtained the Lone Sword, Lorena decided he must be one of the supreme masters of the chaos, making him no less powerful than the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>Of course, Tianming was overjoyed, but he was also thinking about Zheng.</p>

  <p>What if he was compared with Zheng?</p>

  <p>If they were to be honest, even Bromley and Mike didn't have much confidence in Zheng. After all, it was difficult to reach Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Out of all of them, Tianming should have been the first person to reach this stage after the era of Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought Zheng would be able to bring a world back?</p>

  <p>"Zheng, how did you find the Ruin Graveyard?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Bromley, Mike and Lorena, listened.</p>

  <p>"Wait, you don't know?" Zheng asked, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.</p>

  <p>"I asked someone to bring a small butterfly into the Mysterious Yellow Tower. It should be carried by someone from the Ruin Graveyard. I could find you when I sensed the butterfly's location, but it seems like you don't know that at all."</p>

  <p>When Bromley, Holy Jay, Tianming, and the others heard this, they immediately turned their heads towards Mike.</p>

  <p>Mike's eyes lit up. "The butterfly! The butterfly was guiding you!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Lone Sword behind Tianming began to buzz. After a few seconds, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Dale, Derrick, Arthur, and Justin began to appear one by one.</p>

  <p>"Master Dale!" When Zheng saw Dale, he smiled. He then turned to look at the old man beside him and recognized him immediately. "My name is Zheng. Greetings, Grand Supreme Elderly Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Ahem..." The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord coughed and explained,</p>

  <p>"Your father, Mike, carries the small butterfly. I have told him before."</p>

  <p>Mike rolled his eyes. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was a man of few words and never told Mike that the butterfly would be so useful in leading his son back.</p>

  <p>"So I'm guessing you two know each other?" Tianming asked, hints of amusement and surprise present in his voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "Actually, this is the first time I've met the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord! Although, I must say I'm sure that everything that's happened to me since I was in the Evolutionary Universe has something to do with him."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" Bromley asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the owner of the Ruin Graveyard and the Mysterious Yellow Tower, no one knew if he had anything to do with the divine land.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Weapon Refining Method you gave me was not obtained by you accidentally but a special gift from the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Bromley raised his eyebrows, silently doubting what he just heard.</p>

  <p>"It involves the entire chaos or maybe even a larger world. It's too complicated," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tianming felt a slight vibration from the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>The vibration was subtle, but it had a certain rhythm. Tianming didn't know the reason for it, but the Grand Supreme Elderly answered his silent question for him. "It's the other end of the Lone Sword. Zheng, that should be your son, Geoffrey."</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey?"</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey? Is it Geoffrey on the other side of the Lone Sword? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Not far away, Lorena and Rosie, who were listening to their conversation, felt excited at the mention of Geoffrey.</p>
