<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2309 The Forbidden Area Opened </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The so-called "Astronomical Transit" was the phenomenon referred to the moment when some star moved between the sun and the earth, covering a part of the sun's light and creating a huge black spot shadow.</p>

  <p>Such a phenomenon wasn't a rare sight in the divine land.</p>

  <p>That said, the Astronomical Transit phenomenon was particularly special in Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Every few years, a star would completely block out the sun's light. The shadow of the black spot formed would cover the entire Time Sea.</p>

  <p>And every time, the star that caused the Astronomical Transit was a different one. More so, the nine stars that appeared before the Sun Blind race's leader took turns causing the Astronomical Transit.</p>

  <p>What most people didn't necessarily know was that when the sunlight above the Time Sea was blocked out, it was also the moment when the Time Sea, otherwise known as this big forbidden area, was opened. The nine stars represented the nine different entrances to the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Across all the divine land, there were several different forbidden areas of various sizes and they were constantly being explored by the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>As soon as any divine might coins had been condensed, they were snatched by the True Gods from the place. The less divine might coins that existed, the more precious they became. For this reason, True Gods searched for them crazily, and eventually, it caused a vicious cycle.</p>

  <p>For the Time Sea though, this forbidden area was only opened on Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>Throughout any other period of time, no one ever travelled there to explore. The divine might coins that were formed would slowly pile up, and to the True Gods of the powerful clans, the place was genuinely a huge treasure trove!</p>

  <p>All the powerful clans hoped for the possibility that every one of their warriors from the Floating Islands would enter the Time Sea on Astronomical Transit Day, and collect the numerous divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately though, this would never occur because the Sun Blind race had a harsh rule � only the True Gods they invited were eligible to participate in the Astronomical Transit Day celebration.</p>

  <p>As for the rule the Sun Blind race had to invite their guests, now, that was still unclear.</p>

  <p>In general, the stronger their strength and the more talented they were, the more chances they had of being invited. However, occasionally, there were certain obscure people from the Floating Islands that also happened to be invited to the event. No one really understood why, or how.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, the rich clans would continuously organize a batch of True Gods that waited to be invited by the Sun Blind race on Astronomical Transit Day, but the Sun Blind race still stuck to their usual rule for inviting guests. In the end, the rich clans on the Floating Islands gave up their tactics. On Astronomical Transit Day, anyone who was confident that they would be invited by the Sun Blind race had the permission to wait by the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The shadow cast by the Water Luminous Star quickly spread throughout the Time Sea. It blocked the sunlight from the Sun Blind race's island, the Floating Islands, as well as the entire Time Sea...</p>

  <p>The whole Time Sea was quickly and totally immersed in darkness.</p>

  <p>Of course, this wasn't absolute darkness. The scorching sun's rays could still penetrate the Water Luminous Star and thus, a dim light still shone through.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>Once the sky had completely dimmed out, the Sun Blind race lit up their torches one after another, and as they did this, they began to scream in a rhythmic way.</p>

  <p>"Wow, wow, wow..."</p>

  <p>Once the Water Luminous Star had fully transited the sun, all the Sun Blind members began to dance in joy. The celebration had begun!</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind members were all devout. This was their unique holiday, but to outsiders, it was generally considered a little boring.</p>

  <p>Both the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings had their eyes closed in order to rest their mind, while the True Gods were quietly making their preparations before the Time Sea Forbidden Land was opened. The amount of divine might coins that had been accumulated there for several years now was astonishing - they had no choice but to be fully prepared.</p>

  <p>"Nelly," Rachelle called out for her sister suddenly.</p>

  <p>Nelly turned around and asked, "What's up, Rachelle?"</p>

  <p>"After entering the Time Sea Forbidden Land, I have something else to do. If you have time, keep an eye on that guy for me, will you?" Rachelle asked.</p>

  <p>"Do I need to force him to act or anything?" Nelly asked in return.</p>

  <p>"No. You only need to keep an eye on him," replied Rachelle, shaking her head from side to side.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in my strength," Nelly muttered bitterly.</p>

  <p>Despite saying this, Nelly also knew that if Zheng really was the anonymous man in the Arena of Legends, she probably was no match for him. After all, when Zheng had still been a proving godly warrior, he had defeated her. Now, he had become a True God! Her chances would be extremely slim.</p>

  <p>"It has nothing to do with your strength. I just have to verify something, and then I'll kill him immediately," Rachelle stated seriously.</p>

  <p>"Kill him?" Nelly repeated, in confusion.</p>

  <p>Although she had been defeated by the anonymous man in the past, there was no need to kill him. Honestly speaking, there wasn't much hatred standing between her and anonymous man, anyway.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing Nelly's expression, Rachelle said with a slight smile,</p>

  <p>"There are certain things you just don't need to know everything about."</p>

  <p>Disappointment etched itself on Nelly's face. She looked at Zheng again, and she felt that Zheng was more than just the anonymous man. After all, there were others who had tried every method possible to conceal their names when entering the Arena of Legends, and they somewhat all had their hidden secrets.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race's dull and boring ceremony finally came to an end.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods present wore an expression of excitement on their faces. Of course, a few of them had no idea of what Astronomical Transit Day was for, and they stood there clueless, wondering what they were even doing here. In fact, a few of the True Gods even thought that the only harvest they obtained from the event was that they had seen the Holy Beings of the clans.</p>

  <p>The woman in white gently waved her hand, and the Water Luminous Star at the center of the nine pagodas emitted a faint light. This light became brighter and brighter by the second. As the light continued to glow, it equally began to emit a dazzling blue light, and finally it formed a strange passage.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Isn't this a passage to the forbidden land?"</p>

  <p>A True God couldn't help but exclaim his surprise.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, just like Zheng, this True God simply hadn't expected to be invited here by the Sun Blind race. He had no idea what was going to happen next, and thus, he couldn't help but cry out in surprise as he saw the entrance to the forbidden area suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>One of the True Gods standing beside him gave him a hard stare, probably feeling that he had made a fuss.</p>

  <p>The female leader of the Sun Blind race said flatly, "Yes. The forbidden area will be opened every time we hold an Astronomical Transit Day celebration. You can explore the area and take away all the treasures you come by in it."</p>

  <p>Pure pleasure appeared on the True God's face. Previously, he had thought that the Astronomical Transit Day celebration was extremely boring, and couldn't figure out why so many people were still so excited to be here. Now that he knew the reasons, he only naturally felt very excited.</p>

  <p>When the azure passageway had finished forming and became completely stable, all of the consummate True Gods present exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Rachelle was the first one to rush into the passageway, without a second's hesitation.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the consummate True Gods of other powerful clans began to fly into the passage, one after the next.</p>

  <p>Although there were no written rules about who should enter first, the True Gods present still entered the passageway according to their cultivation levels. The ones with higher cultivation levels always had priority, no matter the situation or event at hand.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods' goal was not the amazing quantity of divine might coins!</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods were followed by top-rank True Gods, and then mid-rank True Gods, and finally, the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Liusu, on her behalf, didn't wait for Aleyna, or any of the others in fact. With her back to Zheng, she secretly kept an eye on him. What she observed though was nothing more than Aleyna, Kelsey and Zheng muttering to each other.</p>

  <p>She didn't stop before them, but rushed into the passage on her own instead.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Why didn't Liusu wait for us?" Aleyna's mouth was wide open in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Without any hesitation, Zheng walked toward the passageway with Aleyna and Kelsey following right behind him.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had entered a forbidden area in the divine land. He was amazed!</p>

  <p>According to his judgment, the divine land's forbidden areas were also places imagined by all True Gods, which were made from the Faith Energy. He wondered what the forbidden area in the Time Sea was like.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng entered though, he saw something that astonished him even more. Except for the consummate True Gods who had already disappeared without a trace, the True Gods that had rushed inside earlier were all crazily gathering the divine might coins on the ground...</p>
