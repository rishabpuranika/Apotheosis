<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had left the thatched hut, he knew exactly what the Evil God had said and thought.</p>

  <p>The Evil God seemed reluctant to accept his proposal, but Zheng had no intention of backing down either.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not plan on controlling the fate of the Evil God. Having a Rebirth Land would not affect the Evil God's cultivation base. He could still have the chance to cross the Sea of Truth and become an Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>By keeping the Evil God's inner world here, Zheng tried to make sure that he would not become his enemy. He wanted to keep the peace between himself and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was unsure if he would accept this condition. All that was left, was to wait for his reply.</p>

  <p>The next day, the Evil God came to the floating island after all.</p>

  <p>He had given Zheng's offer much thought and realized he was not in the condition to bargain with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not having much choice, the Evil God accepted his offer to become a Holy Being. However, that did not mean he approved of Zheng's methods. He planned on finding ways to retrieve his inner world once he left this world.</p>

  <p>Although this was Zheng's first time in granting a Rebirth Land, it was not too challenging. Just like what Emily had proposed. He only needed to give a small part of his inner world to the Evil God and ask him to merge it with his inner world.</p>

  <p>The process was similar to that of soaking in the holy spring on the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, a universe appeared in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>His inner world was nothing compared to the divine land. The divine land was far superior in all its splendor. Likewise, this universe in his inner world couldn't be compared to that of a Holy Being in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, because of the appearance of this universe, some restrictions to the Evil God's cultivation were removed, and the Evil God was finally able to break through to the consummation of True God Realm. He was able to surpass and conquer all his past limitations.</p>

  <p>Having mastered three thousand Godly Ways before, the Evil God's understanding of them had risen to a whole new level.</p>

  <p>Within three days of becoming a Holy Being, he had mastered the consummate level theurgies of Thunderstorm Godly Way, Earth Godly Way, and Five Elements Godly Way. He even created some strange theurgies beyond these Godly Ways. The Evil God was unmatched in his talent of grasping every concept with ease.</p>

  <p>Zheng silently observed him learn all of them from a distance. He could not help but be impressed by the limitless talents of the Evil God. He was taken aback by how quickly he acquired the theurgies.</p>

  <p>As he studied the Evil God at work, he became unsure. He began questioning himself and his decisions. 'Did I do the right thing in allowing such a powerful guy to enter the Source World?'</p>

  <p>However, the Source World was not his. The Nine Li race had been destroyed. Even if the Evil God managed to gain power in the future in the Source World, it would not be an issue for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Three months had passed since then.</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship was already very close to the ring of chaos clouds. The dark brown mass of chaotic energy floated along slowly. As it hovered above them they could feel strong sensations of depression sinking inside of them.</p>

  <p>Emily looked over at the clouds with a blank expression, and said to Leopold, "Conceal the Trumpet Flying Ship."</p>

  <p>Leopold nodded.</p>

  <p>After all, they had stolen the Trumpet Flying Ship from the Yellow Emperor Guards. Coming so close to their destination, they could not afford to take risks. They had to tread lightly from here on out. If they were detected by the Yellow Emperor Guards, they would be at the threat of being exposed.</p>

  <p>Leopold took the necessary measures to camouflage the ship. He pinched the jade plate, and traces of Space Law enveloped the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>It was like it was wrapped in an invisible cloak, making it hard to detect for outsiders. Besides, they were now in a vast space. The seemingly small distance was actually enormous. Even if they came across someone right now, the long distance would make it harder to perceive the ship through the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!" The ship moved forward in a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>After a few hours, the Trumpet Flying Ship finally flew into the chaos clouds.</p>

  <p>After several hours of travelling, the ship paved its way through the clouds.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed something had changed. He looked up at the sky and watched it change its color into a pale yellow. It looked as though someone painted it with an earthy brown. He silently observed with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Source World?" Zheng asked in surprise with his mouth gaping open and his eyes fixated at the sky.</p>

  <p>Observing her brother's reaction, Yan looked in the same direction as him.</p>

  <p>The pale yellow sky and the closing distance between them and the Source World made her stare in awe.</p>

  <p>From their current position, they could not see the whole Source World. The divine land was fairly large. However, compared to the Source World, it was like a tiny grain of sand. The variations in size between them spoke volumes of how vast the Source World was.</p>

  <p>"Well, we're at the bottom of the Source World now. In fact, the Source World is not flat. You can think of it as a sphere," Emily informed them.</p>

  <p>"You mean it's a star?" Zheng asked, giving in to his curiosity.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's surprised expression, Emily smiled gently and said, "Yeah, like that. People of the Source World don't live on its surface, but inside.</p>

  <p>And the Source World is not a circle. It's oval." She shrugged and continued, "In fact, I have never seen the entire Source World myself."</p>

  <p>As the Trumpet Flying Ship flew forward, Yan ran towards the rails of the ship. She stood on her toes and held onto the rails for safety. Her eyes seemed to widen as she stared ahead with wonder. Though she feared for her future, she was also full of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, look! What's that?" Yan exclaimed as she pointed at a shadow in the distance.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted his eyes and looked in the same direction as her to make out what she saw. "It looks like a huge bug."</p>

  <p>"That's the insect ship," Leopold explained with his arms folded.</p>

  <p>Emily gave a nod of acknowledgement and said, "It's a flying ship belonging to a special race that are proficient in controlling all sorts of strange insects. Their flying ships are usually made of the shells of giant insects. That's why it's called the insect ship."</p>

  <p>Yan couldn't help but frown at the thought of ugly insects. She had experienced many challenges in her early years, but she was still young. A young girl who would naturally be appalled by insects. She instinctively looked away with a pouty face.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, rays of colorful light swept across the space hundreds of miles away from the Trumpet Flying Ship. In each ray of the colorful light there seemed to be a boat, in which a human figure was vaguely seen rowing the boat. The boats were moving at a faster pace than that of the ship.</p>

  <p>Once the boats flew past them, square boxes began to appear in the distance. These boxes resembled black coffins, which revealed a trace of gloom.</p>

  <p>As they got closer to the Source World, unusual things started popping out of nowhere. The atmosphere around them became livelier than before. Zheng and Yan watched in utter amusement as they experienced so many new things.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the passers-by didn't notice the existence of the Trumpet Flying Ship. Even if they did, they wouldn't pay much attention to it. After all, outsiders didn't know why the ship was there. The reason why Emily had had the ship hidden was to avoid getting spotted by the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>"Let's keep going west. As long as we find the entrance to the Source World and enter the world, we'll be safe when we arrive at Pear Hill," Emily suggested. Her face relaxed as they passed through all potential threats and were now safe.</p>

  <p>Leopold concentrated on controlling the jade plate in his hand. He slightly adjusted the direction and added another divine crystal on it.</p>

  <p>Just when he was about to accelerate the Trumpet Flying Ship, he sensed something through the jade plate and paused, which caused him to turn his head southeast.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened as he saw another flying ship suddenly appear above them. It was about ten thousand miles away from the Trumpet Flying Ship, and it was heading straight for them at an alarming speed!</p>

  <p>"It's another Trumpet Flying Ship!" Emily's face lost color as she panicked.</p>

  <p>Leopold's expression darkened at the sight of it. "How did they find us?"</p>

  <p>Ramzi had taken down the tracking array of the Trumpet Flying Ship. It was almost impossible for the Yellow Emperor Guards to find them, especially while it was disguised.</p>

  <p>Now, another Trumpet Flying Ship was approaching them aggressively.</p>

  <p>Judging by how accurately the ship navigated towards them, it was certain they were discovered. Without Yellow Emperor Magatama, Emily and the others would certainly cause suspicion for the other party.</p>

  <p>Emily ordered without any hesitation, "Ignore them! Let's get out of here as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>As long as they fled to Pear Hill before a large number of Yellow Emperor Guards gathered, they'd stay safe. After entering the Pear Hill the Yellow Emperor Guards would not be able to harm them.</p>
