<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place boasted of extraordinary talents and backgrounds. There were some disciples whose backgrounds were even stronger than Preston's, but now that they had fallen into such a predicament, they had no option but to view Preston as their leader.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race isn't as strong as we think," Preston said loudly.</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded in agreement. They were fully aware of what Preston had said. In terms of strength, the sorcerer race was not very powerful.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could easily kill them.</p>

  <p>But no one knew the methods that the sorcerer race adopted. When ordinary creatures were killed, they would release malicious auras as their curses.</p>

  <p>However, the curses of the sorcerer race were small skulls that could not be gotten rid of. Those skulls were like incurable diseases. Whoever was infected with the skulls would die without exception.</p>

  <p>"We will require a group of expendable soldiers to kill the sorcerer race!</p>

  <p>Only then can the others survive!" After a pause, Preston continued,</p>

  <p>"Those who are willing to take up this mission please step forward."</p>

  <p>There was pin drop silence in the luxuriantly green square in the palace.</p>

  <p>There had been discussions on this proposal from Preston before.</p>

  <p>The core disciples were relatively young. The scene of many people in the underground palace being bitten into pieces and devoured by the small skulls still stayed fresh in their minds.</p>

  <p>They could not get the picture out of their minds and trembled at the thought of it.</p>

  <p>In their hearts, they knew that killing the sorcerer race was tantamount to committing suicide.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one was ready to attack the sorcerer race on the way down the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>Preston had temporarily managed to seal those creatures, giving a chance for others to escape.</p>

  <p>But now, if no one was willing to fight the sorcerer race, everyone would die.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Preston's attitude had an effect on some people or perhaps they truly had no other way out.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, someone finally walked up to the stage and stood beside Preston.</p>

  <p>It was a martial artist wearing a black robe.</p>

  <p>Preston walked up to him and gave him a hug.</p>

  <p>He was an outstanding martial artist of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, trained with great care. Yet, now he had to become an expendable soldier.</p>

  <p>The second martial artist walked up to the stage.</p>

  <p>So did the third one.</p>

  <p>Gradually, more and more martial artists gathered on the stage.</p>

  <p>Soon, more than three hundred people had gathered around Preston.</p>

  <p>The remaining seven hundred people in the square couldn't make up their minds. Everyone's understanding of life was different, so it was not easy to make such a decision.</p>

  <p>Preston didn't force them. Deep in his heart, he wanted to keep as many martial artists as possible.</p>

  <p>"It's enough. These three hundred expendable soldiers are more than enough." "Now all of you listen to me very carefully. I will set up the Sky Demon Eliminating Array. All you need to do is guard the three hundred important positions."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Preston was under great pressure in this counterattack, because he would have to bear the brunt of most of the sorcerer race's curses.</p>

  <p>He guided the team on how to guard the important positions. They came from the Pure Jade Sacred Place and the array that Preston was telling them to set up was the same as that of the inheritance of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, so they mastered in no time.</p>

  <p>Seeing what unfolded in front of her, Ning Yudie held these warriors in high esteem. Although they were core disciples, they were not prominent in the universe. But in desperate situations, the power they showed couldn't be ignored. It could be considered the force of human nature.</p>

  <p>If they could eliminate the sorcerer race here, they would have better chances of surviving.</p>

  <p>Even in the four divine kingdoms, everyone was panic-stricken.</p>

  <p>The elders of the divine kingdoms all understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>The powerhouses that came out of nowhere seemed to have caused a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>But they didn't have the slightest chance of resisting. They couldn't just kick those troublemakers out, right? Who would dare to persuade them to leave?</p>

  <p>Before they knew, 12 hours had passed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a huge crack appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Numerous tiny black dots were visible from the crack.</p>

  <p>They rapidly started falling from the sky and began to grow bigger.</p>

  <p>The divine kingdom citizens looked up at the sky with great curiosity.</p>

  <p>They quickly discovered that these descending objects were actually massive skulls.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A giant skull released a black bolt of lightning as it smashed into the ground hard, creating a deep crater.</p>

  <p>Then black shadows began to crawl out from the skull one after another.</p>

  <p>Around the skull were many divine kingdom martial artists. As they saw this, they didn't even dare to breathe. The terrifying looks of the black shadows left them overwhelmed by terror.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the members of the sorcerer race didn't even look at those martial artists and directly headed towards the royal palace of York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>They aimed at the people from the Pure Jade Sacred Place only, and they had no interest in the people of the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>"Here they are." At this moment, Preston was standing at the very top of the palace of York Divine Kingdom. He brought his hands together and a scorching white stream of space power drew out horizontal and vertical lines, spreading out from his body.</p>

  <p>Soon, the lines enveloped the three hundred expendable soldiers.</p>
