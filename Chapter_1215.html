<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothea was well aware of what the real priority was.</p>

  <p>Although the Ancestral Dragon was indeed important, it was still nothing compared to a warrior with the title of the golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Even if they found out it wasn't true, they would still be able to take away the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>An imprinting was always troublesome, most especially the imprinting on this Ancestral Dragon. Even the Celestial Position race would have to pay a considerable price if they wanted to remove it from the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>Still, that was only trouble� trouble that could be solved.</p>

  <p>And no matter how much trouble they dealt with, they probably still wouldn't be able to get a warrior with the Celestial Position title. After a moment of thought, Dorothea decided to verify the matter before anything.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's golden eyes remain vigilant, Dorothea knew he was still hostile toward her. With a slight smile, she said, "I won't capture you.</p>

  <p>Can you follow me?"</p>

  <p>Albeit cautiously, Luo Zheng still nodded.</p>

  <p>With that, Dorothea started walking down the stairs step by step, while Luo Zheng followed behind, carrying the Ancestral Dragon in his arms.</p>

  <p>The two quickly exited the tall, pointed tower, leaving the area affected by the Time Law.</p>

  <p>Although they spent an hour in the tower, the time flow rate they were under the influence of sped up real time by a thousand� to the outside world, they were in and out of the tower in an instant.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng stepped outside the tower, the time flow rate around him returned to normal� all the plants around the area covered by the Time Law began to rapidly blossom, wither, and die in a cycle.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A black shadow flashed toward Luo Zheng and Dorothea, like a swallow flying through the clouds before he stopped midair. It turned out to be a man in black called Woody.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, what happened? Why did Delroy's enchanted barrier shatter�" he asked immediately.</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his words, his gaze fell on Luo Zheng, who was standing still behind Dorothea. His focus shifted to the small dragon in Zheng's arms. Realizing what it was, Woody's eyes shone aggressively.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? The Ancestral Dragon� Has it already hatched?"</p>

  <p>When Woody entered the pointed tower numerous times in the past, the Ancestral Dragon was ever-protected by a refracted space, and he was unable to take it for himself. All he could do was to make use of the time flow rate to speed up its hatching.</p>

  <p>So even if Delroy's enchanted barrier was broken, they weren't too nervous about it� even with the enchanted barrier broken, no one should have been able to take the egg away.</p>

  <p>But when Woody saw Luo Zheng holding that very dragon, he was baffled, wondering what really unfolded in the pointed tower.</p>

  <p>Without much thought, Woody had the instant urge to snatch the small dragon from Zheng's hands right at that moment.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng would not let Woody take it. Suddenly, he activated the life vitality within his body as he exerted the Cloud-chasing Skill, ready to escape.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to run!" Woody sneered.</p>

  <p>Then, he unsheathed the enormous black saber and began fiercely chopping at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dorothea frowned and the flower in her right eye suddenly spun. A pink, blinding light shot out from the flower's pistil.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The light went right for Woody's black saber, instantly sealing it in place!</p>

  <p>Preparing to slash down, Woody was going extremely fast as he brandished the black saber. But the sealing power of Dorothea's pink light was too domineering� after being sealed once, the black saber was completely wrapped and suspended midair, unable to move an inch.</p>

  <p>Never did Woody expect Dorothea to use such a powerful sealing skill on his saber. Just as he was about to slash down, the saber turned uncontrollable and slipped out of his hand. In the end, he held onto nothing but air as he tried to slash Luo Zheng� it was rather humiliating for him.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, what are you doing? Are you going to betray the Celestial Position?" Woody asked her, like a warning.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng carrying the dragon and following behind Dorothea, Woody could tell that something was wrong. Now that Dorothea was blatantly getting in his way, he couldn't understand what was going on in her head� Dorothea betraying the Celestial Position was the only plausible conclusion he could come to.</p>

  <p>But much to his surprise, Dorothea shook her head. "No. There's something more important I have to do."</p>

  <p>"Something more important? What are you saying?" Woody asked, almost in a fit of rage. Though he had always respected Dorothea, at this moment, he couldn't think of anything more important than the Ancestral Dragon. Collecting the newly hatched Ancestral Dragon and the young Evil Dragon was the whole purpose of their trip. It wasn't a particularly difficult mission, but it was truly important.</p>

  <p>After pondering, Dorothea decided that there were some things she did not need to explain to Woody. But after seeing his glare, she continued,</p>

  <p>"I found the Tower of Crystal."</p>

  <p>"The Tower of Crystal?"</p>

  <p>After the initial stunned silence, Woody began to understand.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Celestial Position, he had once entered the Tower of Illusory for training� his name was right beside Dorothea's on the first row.</p>

  <p>He was aware of the three towers that were used for training, but the Tower of Crystal had been lost.</p>

  <p>These three towers were very important to the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Finding the Tower of Crystal was no small matter.</p>

  <p>"But� But so what if we find the Tower of Crystal? We cannot let this guy just take the Ancestral Dragon away!" Woody was clearly indignant.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Crystal and the Ancestral Dragon were completely unrelated to each other.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to say any more," Dorothea said. "Let's go and look for Max first. You'll understand later."</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Woody didn't say anything in the end. He knew how Dorothea normally was� she always seemed happy-go-lucky, fond of playing tricky games. Very rarely was she deadly earnest in dealing with anything.</p>

  <p>Seeing how serious she was, Woody had to consider the gravity of the matter.</p>

  <p>With that, Dorothea walked to the front while Luo Zheng followed behind, the small dragon still in his arms. All the while, Woody stared at Luo Zheng ruthlessly, making sure that he wouldn't try to run away again.</p>

  <p>The three of them kept a constant speed as they flew above the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the little dragon in Zheng's arms was running its fluffy head against his face. From time to time, it made a gurgling sound, much like a human infant, acting spoiled in Zheng's care.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a sorrowful roar suddenly erupted.</p>

  <p>"Aooo..."</p>

  <p>When the roar was heard, the dragon in Zheng's arms suddenly began trembling as it buried its small head into Zheng's chest� by then, it had regarded Luo Zheng as its mother, thinking that Luo Zheng could protect it by all means.</p>

  <p>The roar was of the Evil Dragon in the distance.</p>

  <p>On that end, Max and the other four continued suppressing the young Evil Dragon.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! This Evil Dragon will seal himself up and undergo the fourth transformation!"</p>

  <p>"Stop it, or we'll be in huge trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Attack its neck. I've already cut it open�"</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom...</p>

  <p>The powerful attacks landed right on the Evil Dragon's body one after another, releasing intense light right on the surface of its body.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the large hole, the warriors of the four divine kingdoms were still blankly staring at the battle in the sky.</p>

  <p>The strength of these Spirit Supreme Realm masters was far beyond their imagination, but the Evil Dragon was also undeniably terrifying. It hadn't yet grown up, but its strength was equivalent to an eleventh-level vicious beast's, equal as well to that of the human Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>But an Evil Dragon of this level could fight against several Spirit Supreme Realm masters with its own strength. When this Evil Dragon grew up, how terrifying would its strength be in the future?</p>

  <p>Of course, the Soul Sea Realm masters were worried� they could barely protect themselves at the time. Most of them were already wondering how soon they would be killed.</p>

  <p>As Soul Sea Realm masters, they were considered powerful among the four divine kingdoms. But when faced with the Spirit Supreme Realm masters, they were practically nothing. And having their souls confined in the corpses didn't help� they didn't even have the strength to resist.</p>
