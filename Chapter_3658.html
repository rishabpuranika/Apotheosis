<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart hammered in his chest when Springer mentioned the east side.</p>

  <p>He realized that he had forgotten about one important thing.</p>

  <p>The Evil God!</p>

  <p>He immediately focused and tried to sense the Evil God's location with a thought.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was now his own Inner-world Generating Avatar. Just like his hands and feet, Zheng could control him as long as he could sense him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Evil God could not refuse any order that Zheng gave him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng couldn't find the Evil God's location. He was naturally shocked and something popped up in his mind.</p>

  <p>Before their current situation, he had already ordered the Evil God to return immediately after killing those Fickle Demons. Technically speaking, the Evil God would be unable to disobey the order or even escape.</p>

  <p>After he thought for a while, he suddenly looked up at Springer and asked,</p>

  <p>"Can those Fickle Demons be killed?"</p>

  <p>Now, Springer didn't know why Zheng had asked such a question, but since "Emperor Charm" said Zheng was his master, he couldn't refuse to answer him. Thus, he could only answer honestly, "The Fickle Demons can't be killed, and they can grow bigger if someone keeps hunting them down and killing them. They would disappear only if the entire Fickle World is destroyed. I will withdraw the summoned world now!"</p>

  <p>There were still many Fickle Demons within the area. Most of the Oneness Guards hid in the twelve passes, but the Fickle Demons still continued to attack the twelve passes' arrays like mad.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Could you possibly check what the Fickle Demons see?" said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Of course I can," Springer replied, but he became even more confused.</p>

  <p>What did Zheng want to do?</p>

  <p>"I want to find someone who is in that direction!" Zheng exclaimed and pointed to the east. Upon hearing Zheng's words, Springer suddenly thought of the huge Fickle Demons.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had entered the Fickle Demons' minds.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but be stunned at what he saw.</p>

  <p>He caught sight of a human being, who was attacking the Fickle Demons like crazy.</p>

  <p>Those Fickle Demons did not die, but became stronger every time they were attacked. That human being should've realized that already.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he patiently continued to attack the Fickle Demons and seemed to make them become stronger!</p>

  <p>When the Fickle Demons' bodies became larger, the man was finally at a disadvantage. He had no choice but to run to save his life.</p>

  <p>As he ran, he did not forget to turn around and attack the Fickle Demons.</p>

  <p>Then he flew towards the east. "Have you found him?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Springer stretched out his hand and a translucent black gem appeared on his palm. The black gem was the Fickle World's Civilization Artifact, which was also Springer's most important possession. He seldom showed it to others.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The black gem released a thick black smoke that floated towards Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The smoke from the Civilization Artifact could turn a person into a Fickle Demon. If Springer chose to launch a sneak attack, then Zheng might not be able to resist.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Springer had intended to do so.</p>

  <p>Yet, he immediately discarded the thought as soon as the idea came to him.</p>

  <p>He could not hurt his master.</p>

  <p>He mentally sighed and chose to compromise. Besides, the whole Sun Crow race had defected, and he wasn't the only one to blame.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's eyes touched the smoke, he saw the scene that the Evil God was being chased by the Fickle Demons.</p>

  <p>"He just used the Ways-blending Energy, but why did he keep activating the power of the Civilization Artifact?" said Zheng with arched brows. He had sensed just now that the Evil God had used the power to deal with the Fickle Demons, which he thought was normal.</p>

  <p>He didn't think much about it, but felt that something was not right.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Evil God only used one or two divine megatons of force at a time.</p>

  <p>Although he had been confused about the matter before, he didn't really think about it carefully. Now, it seemed that the Evil God was testing the limits of his control.</p>

  <p>Springer saw how Zheng clearly looked cautious and stressed, and then said,</p>

  <p>"This person has only left for a short time, so he must be still in the North Unicorn Province. We can help you find him!"</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng hesitated for a second, before he finally ordered the members of the Sun Crow race in a deep voice, "Find where he is now!"</p>

  <p>He didn't want to order the Sun Crow race to do anything at this critical moment, especially when he wasn't their real commander in chief. It was just that he simply couldn't ignore the Evil God's potential and the fact that he had comprehended the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't let the Evil God escape!</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Springer said and bowed to Zheng. Then he turned to Bagot.</p>

  <p>To find someone in the vast North Unicorn Province was like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, there were many members of the Sun Crow race, so they might be able to find the Evil God if they searched together!</p>

  <p>Bagot waved his hand, and numerous Sun Crows flew out, heading to the east.</p>

  <p>The current situation was no different from what Zheng had thought.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had continuously extracted the power not to defend against the enemy, but to check Zheng's control range.</p>

  <p>He couldn't disobey Zheng's orders, but he also couldn't kill the Fickle Demons. Therefore, he didn't need to return to Zheng before he killed them.</p>

  <p>Whenever he attacked, he also retreated. After he had retreated for one million and five hundred thousand miles, he discovered that he couldn't draw out more divine megatons of power.</p>

  <p>He was slightly happy. Thus, he stopped fighting the Fickle Demons, got rid of them, and ran away.</p>

  <p>He was finally free from the feeling of being imprisoned that had haunted him for so long!</p>

  <p>Actually, the Nihility race had already decided to help him get rid of the Inner-world Generating Avatar through the Chilling Bone Land. It was known that entering the Chilling Bone Land was equivalent to being reborn.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he had to ask Sienna to erase his memories so he could deceive Zheng. As a result, the Evil God right now didn't know about that specific detail at all, which was why he was willing to take the risk and escape.</p>

  <p>As he continued to move east for another million miles, the Fickle World in that same area disappeared.</p>

  <p>Since he used to own a Civilization Artifact, he clearly knew the rules of the world that descended.</p>

  <p>If a world disappeared, it meant that either its owner withdrew it, or the owner had died.</p>

  <p>The Evil God refused to accept either of those outcomes, as it meant that the war would end.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he wasn't safe in the North Unicorn Province, so he wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>But the North Unicorn Province was extremely large. If one wanted to leave without the transmission array, it would probably take them over a month.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he had an idea. He eventually found a river and jumped in with a splash. After he sank to the bottom, he dug out a cave and proceeded to drill downwards.</p>

  <p>Hiding deep underground should be the safest way.</p>

  <p>He dug a cave with a complicated pathway as he went along. He killed a few long snakes that lurked underground, and then finally opened up a small underground secret hideout.</p>

  <p>In the secret hideout, the Evil God sat cross-legged as he recited the Truth of Godly Way and went to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that he had already contacted the Black Ship because he had lost his memories, so he continued to think about how to get in touch with Shera.</p>
