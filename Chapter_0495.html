<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 495 It's Useless To Apologize </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was at that precise moment that Tristan suddenly recognized Zheng. He looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>There were two shocking events which had taken place within the Luo Clan last year.</p>

  <p>The first one was that Zheng had been taken away by the weapon refining master Evil Lan, and the second one was that Perrin had been disabled at the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>No one knew whether Zheng was still alive or not after his capture, and where he was now.</p>

  <p>It was still a mystery who had disabled Perrin's skills.</p>

  <p>All the Luo Clan members remained tight-lipped about these two events.</p>

  <p>Initially, they had all thought that Zheng must have died. Since the weapon refiner Evil Lan was said to be extremely wicked and cruel, Zheng wouldn't have had a chance to escape his clutches.</p>

  <p>However, as time went on, rumors spread among the Luo Clan. Someone still believed that he had died, but others said that Zheng was still alive and had become a disciple of Cloud Sect, the holy land that every practitioner yearned to go to.</p>

  <p>Although they described many details which sounded quite real, most members of the Luo Clan didn't believe it. After all, they had witnessed Zheng being taken away by Evil Lan, who was supposed to be the most vile person among his contemporaries. Besides, it wasn't that easy to become a disciple of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>After years of training, Perrin was the only child in the Luo Clan who had reached the cultivation level high enough to be accepted by Cloud Sect. As far as the Luo Clan was concerned, Zheng couldn't have been on par with Perrin at all, so most of the family members didn't take the rumors seriously.</p>

  <p>Before they could completely recover from the shock of Zheng's being taken away, Perrin's skills had suddenly been disabled and he had been sent back home from Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>It was a big blow to the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Each clan in C County paid great attention to the training of their young generation, and many of them would do anything that was required to send their children to Cloud Sect for cultivation.</p>

  <p>These clans didn't expect much. They just hoped that their children could become an inner disciple of Cloud Sect and reach the nature level. Even that was a big reward for them.</p>

  <p>Mike Luo had only reached the nature level many years ago and that was a big deal.</p>

  <p>For most people, a nature creature was powerful and talented enough to be the backbone of a clan.</p>

  <p>It meant that even if a clan member was just an outer disciple of Cloud Sect, no other clans would have dared to challenge it so easily.</p>

  <p>The other clans feared that if this outer disciple ever happened to reach a high enough level of cultivation, he would seek revenge.</p>

  <p>Perrin had already reached the nature level and had even played up to a noble clan, the Wang Clan.</p>

  <p>Since everyone thought that Perrin would have a promising future and took him as the most powerful person in C County, the remaining clans had dared not to challenge the Luo Clan even though it wasn't as powerful as it had used to be.</p>

  <p>Perrin's being disabled and his subsequent expulsion from Cloud Sect had broken the only backbone of the Luo clan. This made it vulnerable to potential enemies.</p>

  <p>Now there was no place for the Luo Clan in C County and the businesses and mine fields which used to belong to it were taken over and divided by the others.</p>

  <p>Life had become difficult for the clan members.</p>

  <p>Later, they had overheard that it was Zheng who had disabled Perrin.</p>

  <p>The rumor seemed even less credible, since Perrin had made great progress after taking the Magical Pill of the Luo Clan. Even if Zheng were still alive and had experienced some adventures, there was no way he could have competed with Perrin.</p>

  <p>No one had believed the rumor until Tristan saw Zheng today.</p>

  <p>'As someone who has rebelled against the Luo Clan, Zheng has dared to come back, which means he must have mastered extremely powerful skills. He might have already reached the nature level!' Tristan thought.</p>

  <p>With the help of Zheng, Tristan was able to walk and even slowly climb the staircase. Since his legs had just been healed, his bones couldn't stand heavy load at the moment and he had to walk slowly. Even so, Tristan was shocked by the amazing curative effect of the pill.</p>

  <p>"Stop! If you don't stop, we'll have to use extreme force!" Grey shouted coldly. Although he was arrogant, Grey wasn't stupid. From the auras that Zheng and Yan were exuding, he could tell that they were not ordinary cultivators, so he was afraid to offend them. And after seeing Zheng take out a pill and cure Tristan's broken legs so quickly, he was more certain of his own judgment, since it was almost impossible that such a magic pill could be found anywhere in C County.</p>

  <p>Turning a deaf ear to Grey's threat, Zheng continued to support Tristan and help him climb upstairs, and Yan followed behind the two closely.</p>

  <p>"Stop them! How dare they act wildly in front of the Luo Mansion!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that his threat didn't work, Grey shot a venomous look at Zheng and Yan. He couldn't figure out what level they had reached. However, he could tell that they were very young, so they wouldn't be able to compete with the whole Luo Clan at their current competence.</p>

  <p>Hearing his order, several sturdy men immediately rushed downstairs.</p>

  <p>Tristan was a little worried, since all of these guards were at the bone refining level, and they were greatly competent.</p>

  <p>But he also knew that since Zheng had dared to come back, he must have had his own advantages.</p>

  <p>When the sturdy men had rushed several steps forward, suddenly, a number of black spots appeared in front of Tristan.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, these black spots turned into sharp thorns and flew toward the guards at a furious pace.</p>

  <p>With several puffs, a hole appeared in each of their chests, piercing their armor and bone.</p>

  <p>Blood flowed out from these cavities and a confused expression appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be wondering just what the hell was going on and how these black thorns had suddenly hit them.</p>

  <p>They hadn't seen Zheng and Yan do anything, so they couldn't understand why they were... dead just like that!</p>

  <p>With several bangs, the sturdy men fell down on the ground before they could even let out a shriek.</p>

  <p>Streaks of killing aura gushed from the dead bodies of the guards and floated toward Yan. They didn't come toward Zheng or Tristan because it was Yan who had summoned the black thorns and killed them. To protect Yan, Zheng drew the killing aura in his direction.</p>

  <p>'I really should start practicing sword skills in the killing way from now on!' Zheng thought and looked at the corpses on the ground indifferently, then he assisted Tristan to move on.</p>

  <p>Grey was stunned now.</p>

  <p>He was bewildered about what had happened. How could such powerful men, who had reached the bone refining level, had been killed in an instant without sound or light? 'The young man and the young woman didn't attack just now, then how the hell did my guards die? What kind of skill did they use? Are they devils or ghosts?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? There is no fight between you and our clan, and we haven't hurt you. Why..." Grey was so scared that he almost could not finish his words. The horror in his heart was about to make him cry.</p>

  <p>Finally Tristan reached the top of the staircase with the help of Zheng. "Can you walk by your own now?" Zheng asked gently.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" Tristan answered in a firm and confident tone.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," Zheng told him shortly.</p>

  <p>He then walked straight toward Grey and asked, "Grey, you have really forgotten me, haven't you? "</p>

  <p>Grey was confused. 'How does he know my name? Why did he say that I have forgotten him? Who is he?'</p>

  <p>Grey measured Zheng up and down and suddenly his face turned pale.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's temperament had changed a lot, his facial features remained the same.</p>

  <p>"You! You... are Zheng!" Grey's eyes were filled with disbelief. How could Zheng come back and become so powerful?</p>

  <p>'Zheng?'</p>

  <p>The servant who had been sweeping the floor stopped when he heard the name. He looked at him, as shocked as Grey was at the sudden come back of this man.</p>

  <p>He had been working here for several dozens of years, so he was quite familiar with the Luo Clan. He looked at Zheng carefully and became sure that it was nobody else.</p>

  <p>The young woman standing behind Zheng looked familiar too. She resembled Mike who had died many years ago. Hang on. She must be Yan!</p>

  <p>The servant had never expected that the two siblings would ever come back! He was so excited that his hands began to tremble. If he hadn't been holding the broom with all of his strength, it would most probably have fallen down.</p>

  <p>"Since you know who I am, then you should also know why you have to die today!" With that short and curt statement, Zheng drew a sword from his space ring slowly.</p>

  <p>"I... Please! Don't kill me! Please! Zheng, I know I shouldn't have treated you like that. I'm sorry! Please give me a chance! I can..."</p>

  <p>Before Grey could continue, an icy light flashed in front of him.</p>

  <p>A wound appeared on his neck and blood oozed from it.</p>

  <p>"I... I..." Grey covered his neck with his hands and then fell onto the ground, gagging. As his trachea had been cut open, he could only look at Zheng with his eyes begging for mercy, hoping that Zheng would give him a pill just like the one he had given to Tristan and save his life.</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped forward and looked at Grey's fat face. "It's useless to apologize. Otherwise, why would we ever need weapons! "</p>
