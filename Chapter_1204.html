<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1204 Escape </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With a whooshing sound, the blue crystal-like structure turned into dust and scattered into the air.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned. The dragon-shaped monster hadn't appeared to be dangerous. Perhaps it could only be considered a second-level or third-level fierce beast.</p>

  <p>But it had completely destroyed the corpse occupied by the Soul Sea Realm master with a single roar!</p>

  <p>What on earth was it?</p>

  <p>The soul of the Soul Sea Realm master had been within the corpse's mind. Since the entire upper body was now shattered, his soul was probably destroyed as well.</p>

  <p>"Grab that thing! I'm going to take revenge for Nigel!" One of the Soul Sea Realm masters was enraged and rushed towards the dragon-shaped monster.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! This little thing is a little strange."</p>

  <p>"Stay out of way of its roar!"</p>

  <p>The dragon-shaped monster's roar was powerful, and had even killed a Soul Sea Realm master. But most of the warriors present were at the Soul Sea Realm. For them, the roar was loud and amazing, but not that scary.</p>

  <p>So no one tried to escape from the spot.</p>

  <p>But just as the Soul Sea Realm master came up in front of the dragon-shaped monster, he skidded on the ground and turned around, rushing back.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! Run!" the Soul Sea Realm master shouted to the crowd.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked doubtfully at the master, but their questions were answered when they saw hundreds of dragon-shaped monsters suddenly appear in the alley by the side of the street.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to deal with this little thing. It was deadly dangerous, but subduing it wasn't a difficult task. But hundreds of dragon-shaped monsters? Now, that was terrifying!</p>

  <p>The stunned looks on everyone's faces instantly morphed into fear, after which War King Wind ordered, "Everyone, run!"</p>

  <p>But even before he had finished speaking, he noticed that everyone had already run away, with Luo Luo Zheng leading the retreating pack.</p>

  <p>They were just about to turn into the main road when they heard numerous dragon roars. dozens of sound waves drifted up from the alley nearby and shattered the ten crystal buildings into pieces. The dragon-shaped monsters' roars were too powerful.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for the dragon-shaped monsters to reach the main road, chasing after the warriors. Each of the dragon-shaped monsters held their breath, as if they wanted to emit the deadly sound waves again.</p>

  <p>"Split up! Don't stay here! Split up in two directions and gather at the Jade Lake!" The moment the order had left War King Wind's mouth, the group of Soul Sea Realm masters split into two and rushed into two different streets.</p>

  <p>GROWL!</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the streets, dozens of sound waves attacked them from different directions. The sound waves that were released into the sky did not have any effect, and some sound waves that were at the lower altitude caused a crack to appear on the surface of the road.</p>

  <p>As for the surrounding exquisite buildings, they were no match for the power of these sound waves and fell one after the other.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned and jumped up, landing on the roof of a building and watching the little beasts constantly jumping in excitement.</p>

  <p>"Brianna, what are these things?" he asked.</p>

  <p>This trip to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was turning out to be quite unusual. When Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Feather Emperor Secret Land, the difficulty of passing through the Slow Arrow Area had been greater than the previous years. Now that these strange monsters had appeared, he felt even more curious and confused.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't exactly clear about Brianna's identity, but he was certain of one thing. She was a Dragon Lineage Human, meaning that she might know about these things.</p>

  <p>Brianna, who was floating in the interior world, shook her head and replied, "These little monsters seem to have the blood of the Genuine Dragon, but their blood is not pure. I'm unable to determine what they exactly are!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who was standing on the roof of the building, realized that he had attracted the attention of a dragon-shaped monster. It flapped its narrow wings and flew along the eaves of the building. It then jumped and lunged towards Luo Luo Zheng, opening its large mouth.</p>

  <p>It let out an almighty roar, and an invisible sound wave attacked Luo Luo Zheng without warning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's golden eyes flashed. He dodged the sound wave with a blast of air.</p>

  <p>He appeared behind the dragon-shaped monster and struck it with a swift and fierce elbow strike.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attack sent the body of the dragon-shaped monster flying backwards.</p>

  <p>Since the physical body that Luo Luo Zheng occupied was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, its strength was extremely terrifying. It was probably equal to the strength of Luo Zheng's four thousand dragon scales. The monster flew ten thousand feet into the sky before slowly falling down.</p>

  <p>BAM!</p>

  <p>The dragon-shaped monster smashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on the little thing. Logically speaking, his elbow should've directly crushed it, but not only did it not shatter, it even flipped over after falling on the ground, getting back to its feet again. It was as if it was unharmed.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, if Luo Zheng's sacred weapon body ever suffered a heavy blow from Brianna's physical one, the attack wouldn't actually kill him, but he probably wouldn't be able to stand up for a while.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters, however, might die after taking such a blow. After all, they were not as powerful as the warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm. And the gap between the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors and the Soul Sea Realm warriors was very large.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng saw about eight dragon-shaped monsters heading straight for him.</p>

  <p>His body suddenly moved and flew forward.</p>

  <p>It was much easier for Luo Luo Zheng to escape than the others. After all, he occupied a physical body which was at the Spirit Supreme Realm. The others only occupied the corpses that had been dead for many years, which meant that they couldn't fly and could only rely on the corpses to run on the ground.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Under the power of these roars, the houses on all sides started to collapse.</p>

  <p>Miserable shrieks could be heard from time to time. Quite a few warriors had probably been killed by the dragon-shape monsters' roars.</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was flying through the air, he heard Callan's scream.</p>

  <p>He was being chased by two dragon-shaped monsters and it looked like there was no escape for him.</p>

  <p>"Get away! Such annoying monsters!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>War King Wind roared as his two golden axes flew out.</p>

  <p>He had occupied Federico's corpse and its power was extremely terrifying. In his fury, he had thrown the giant golden axes with an impressive power that could even split a mountain.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The giant axes flew at a speed that didn't allow the dragon-shaped monsters to dodge them. The huge force of the axes colliding into the monsters caused them to smash into a building behind them.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The building collapsed under the impact of the two axes and the monsters.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" War King Wind carried Callan and sprinted forward, fast enough that he didn't see that the two monsters had crawled right back out of the ruins of the building.</p>

  <p>When it came to speed or strength, these dragon-shaped monsters weren't superior. But their physical bodies were terrifyingly tough.</p>

  <p>Even a young Genuine Dragon could not have such a strong physical body. Everyone was completely helpless as they faced the dragon-shaped monsters. All they could do was to run away. dozens of Soul Sea Realm masters were running fast in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, avoiding the attacks of the dragon-shaped monsters.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for them that the little monsters didn't move fast. As the crowd ran madly, they managed to escape the pursuit of the little monsters.</p>

  <p>They had, very quickly, passed through half of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, and soon arrived at the center of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, gathering at the Jade Lake.</p>

  <p>Everyone was fearful and uneasy. Some of them, especially War King Wind, had entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place so many times, so they knew clearly which place was safe and which was dangerous.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for living creatures to exist in the main city of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. Even the most troublesome puppets did not exist here. But now that these dragon-shaped monsters had appeared out of nowhere, it was beginning to look like a bad omen.</p>

  <p>Fiona stood at the edge of the Jade Lake, her face still pale. When War King Wind saw his daughter's expression, he felt sorry for her and tried to console her, "Fiona, those little things are powerful but they're not that scary!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng appeared with a dragon-shaped monster in his hand. He had just flown around and caught one of the dragon-shaped monsters in his hand!</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the dragon-shaped monster warily. But Luo Luo Zheng had already sealed its mouth, so it could not pose a great threat.</p>

  <p>"Look, Tianxing has caught one with his bare hands. There's nothing to be afraid of!" War King Wind said with a smile.</p>

  <p>But Fiona stared at Luo Luo Zheng dazedly and said, "No, that's not what I'm afraid of!"</p>
