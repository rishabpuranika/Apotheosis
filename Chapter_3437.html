<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little monsters continued to carry Zheng like they were a parade, as they walked along the surface of the small star.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before they finally reached the huge statue.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head and carefully peered at it. The human statue had a beard, a ragged face, and its eyes had a unique aura. The surface of the statue was covered with exquisite runes.</p>

  <p>The runes extended all the way from its body to the bottom, then they parted and formed two branches, which then continued to extend until they reached an altar.</p>

  <p>When Zheng gazed at the altar, he felt his heart pound erratically in his chest.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Are these monsters going to sacrifice me?"</p>

  <p>He was completely unfamiliar with the space they were currently in.</p>

  <p>Everything was bizarre and there were no rules to follow.</p>

  <p>From the way how these little monsters protected him, it was indeed like they were carefully safeguarding a sacrificial offering!</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng finished speaking, the little monsters carried him and stepped on the altar.</p>

  <p>There was a loud, metallic clang when they threw the metal plate on the altar. "Hey!" Zheng shouted by the side of the fence that was made up of blue light.</p>

  <p>"Geo...geo... geo..." one of the little monsters spoke.</p>

  <p>It seemed like it tried to explain something to him, but what was the use of such an explanation when he couldn't understand anything it said?</p>

  <p>After the little monster had finished, two unique triangle runes suddenly appeared on the human statue's eyes. As the triangle runes flipped, the statue's eyeballs began to roll. It looked Zheng up and down in quite a strange way.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng also stared back at the statue's eyeballs with an unreadable expression.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long until a bright, white light spread out from both of the eyeballs. The two light beams spread down from the eyes in a way that made them look like tears flowing down the statue's face. The two rays of light continued to flow, until they quickly converged on the altar.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The entire altar flashed with strong light, then wrapped Zheng together with the metal plate.</p>

  <p>When the light illuminated the altar, all the little monsters stepped back and they actually knelt down on the ground in unison. Their eyes were filled with utmost respect.</p>

  <p>The light that enveloped the altar lasted about five minutes, then it gradually dimmed.</p>

  <p>Once the light was gone, Zheng let out a sigh of relief. It looked like they didn't really have any intention of sacrificing him.</p>

  <p>Just then, a shadow suddenly appeared in front of the altar. It repeatedly transformed into different things then finally, it turned into an ancient door.</p>

  <p>"A space door... But why is there no space fluctuation?"</p>

  <p>The space door worked in a similar way as the transmission array. If Zheng was given enough time, he could easily create one.</p>

  <p>Yet, he found out that there was no Space Law in this space!</p>

  <p>There was no space fluctuation when the door had been condensed, either.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he felt extremely weirded out.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the door opened from the middle.</p>

  <p>Two figures emerged out of it. It was a man and a woman, who both floated in the air.</p>

  <p>When the little monsters saw the man and woman, they kept on bowing to them, as if the man and woman were divine beings that descended down to the place. The little monsters showed great reverence towards them.</p>

  <p>The man and the woman, however, did not pay attention to them. Their gazes were on Zheng, and Zheng was also watching them.</p>

  <p>The man was quite handsome and gentle, and the woman was beautiful and seductively charming.</p>

  <p>They stared at each other for a few seconds. After the man had stared at Zheng for a long time, he walked over to Zheng and reached out his hand towards the blue light.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! The blue light?" Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>Even he could not resist the blue light. If the man ever touched it, then the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>When the man heard Zheng's kind warning, he smiled lightly and said, "It's okay."</p>

  <p>With a gentle stroke of his fingers, he let the blue light penetrate through his skin--but he was unscathed.</p>

  <p>In fact, his palm absorbed all the blue light, then the fences that were formed by the blue light disappeared completely!</p>

  <p>"Geo...geo... geo..."</p>

  <p>The little monster who had been trapped with Zheng screamed a few times and jumped off the altar. It knelt down with the other little monsters, as if the altar wasn't a place it should stay--and if it stayed for one more second, it would have desecrated the divine beings.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," said Zheng and he stood up from the metal plate.</p>

  <p>To be honest, he felt a little excited when he finally heard someone speak the human language.</p>

  <p>At least this man and woman could communicate with him normally.</p>

  <p>The man, however, didn't respond.</p>

  <p>The enchanting woman beside him asked, "Did you become an exile here recently?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng nodded. "Are there many humans in the chaos you were in?" the woman asked again.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Zheng quickly deduced that they did not belong to the same round of chaos as him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are many humans, no less than one quintillion," he replied.</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the charming woman looked at each other, their faces lit up with delight. Zheng's answer seemed to make them very satisfied.</p>

  <p>Happy as they were, Zheng's mind was filled with doubts. "You're both human beings like me, but it seems like you are not from the same round of chaos as I am?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The charming woman and the handsome man both shook their heads, then said, "We don't come from chaos."</p>

  <p>"Not from chaos?" Zheng was in shock. "Are you from the outside of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>A world outside the chaos was an obscure concept. Not even No. 9527 knew what it was. Perhaps, Zheng could find the answer from the two humans.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the two of them shook their heads at the same time "We are the aboriginals of this space, but our master is from the chaos. Our master said that according to the calculation in the chaos, he was born in the 77th chaotic era," the woman responded.</p>

  <p>While Zheng still thought about the meaning of her answer, No. 9527 mentally reminded him, "The chaotic era should refer to the process from a round of the chaos' birth, till its destruction. Their master might be from the 77th civilization."</p>

  <p>There were too many civilizations that had once appeared in the chaos, that it was impossible for even No. 9527 to cover all of them in the statistics.</p>

  <p>Some of them had either completely declined and disappeared on the Other Shore, or had hidden themselves.</p>

  <p id="top_6">"Master?"</p>

  <p>Zheng subconsciously looked at the huge statue and asked, "Is your master still in this space?"</p>

  <p>Once again, the man and woman both shook their heads at the same time.</p>

  <p>The woman went over and gently pulled Zheng as she said, "Come with me!"</p>

  <p>The moment they pulled Zheng into the gate, the little monsters below the altar made a loud noise. The man patted his head and said with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Oh, I almost forgot it."</p>

  <p>Next, he took out a small bag, from which thousands of brown beads rolled out.</p>

  <p>Those brown beads were highly important to the little monsters. Indeed, only after when he threw the beads did the little monsters stop making noises.</p>
