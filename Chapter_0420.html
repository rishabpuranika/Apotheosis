<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that Johanson decided to strike, he wouldn't limit himself to only using the soul attack.</p>

  <p>Once an assassin made a move, he would go for the kill!</p>

  <p>Of course, if his opponent had been somebody else, Johanson might have shown him mercy, or say, not caused a fatal injury to his opponent.</p>

  <p>Now that Johanson had regarded Luo Luo Zheng as a man he must kill, he would not reserve his strength!</p>

  <p>Just as Johanson launched the soul attack, a beam of bright light shot out from his hand.</p>

  <p>The light warped into the shape of a short sword? a snake-shaped short sword!</p>

  <p>The short sword was Johanson's family heirloom. It was a fairy weapon that had been passed down within their family for several hundred years!</p>

  <p>When the Jiang family was undermined by the Burning Sky Empire 300 years ago, most of its treasures and fortunes were kept in one of the secret realms of their Shadow Group. Thus the snake-shaped short sword was preserved within the family, and eventually, it was handed down to Johanson.</p>

  <p>He preferred to first, befuddle his opponent's mind with the soul attack, and then, cut the opponent's throat with the snake-shaped short sword.</p>

  <p>Although this assassinating method was quite simple, it was almost impossible to guard against it!</p>

  <p>In most cases, as long as the opponent's soul was not strong enough to resist his soul attack, in no way could he escape from Johanson's snake-shaped short sword!</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's flesh was incredibly strong, he could not be able to fend off the snake-shaped short sword!</p>

  <p>Therefore, as per Johanson, by implementing his two-step attacking method, there was no doubt that Luo Luo Zheng would die!</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>'I'm destined to be a world-famous assassin while you are doomed to be reduced to a pile of bones.</p>

  <p>As to the little locusts that mocked me from the audience, they are bound to admire me, and to listen to legends about me!'</p>

  <p>However, at the precise moment that Johanson's soul attack targeted Luo Zheng's mind, an unexpected event happened!</p>

  <p>The soul attack, to put it simply, was a confrontation on a spiritual level.</p>

  <p>Since Johanson had been consuming the soul-nurturing herb since he was a child, his soul was much stronger than those of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>The soul-nurturing herb was a precious plant, but its effect on enhancing a person's soul was quite limited.</p>

  <p>That was something no one could change. Even Cloud Sect had no books on soul cultivation method other than a few manuals on the use of soul attack!</p>

  <p>It was just too difficult to cultivate one's spirit. Accordingly, to nurture one's spirit with the soul-nurturing herb was a very difficult and expensive project in the first place.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's spirit had been refined by the giant mysterious smelting furnace.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the inhuman suffering thoroughly re-molded Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Although there were ways to strengthen one's soul and some ascetic practitioners would adopt very drastic measures to prepare their souls, a human soul was a fragile thing. Any carelessness might damage it, and if the injury was severe, the man would become an idiot.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng's soul was being refined by the black fire, it was also being repaired by the seven-colored lights of the huge furnace!</p>

  <p>After being tempered like that Luo Zheng's soul was indeed quite resilient.</p>

  <p>In comparison to Luo Zheng's soul, Johanson's soul seemed weak and fragile!</p>

  <p>Therefore, when targeted by Johanson's attempt to kill, Luo Luo Zheng merely felt a little alarmed. The moment Johanson's soul attack reached him, Luo Zheng's eyes widened a little, but he did not react at all.</p>

  <p>The result of a battle between souls would often come out in one second.</p>

  <p>According to legends, some mighty practitioners could battle in the spiritual space. Two peerless martial arts experts could determine which was more powerful solely by combatting with their souls. In that case, the power of the soul attack would practically equal the attacker's strength. However, that kind of contest was not something that Luo Luo Zheng or Johanson could try at present.</p>

  <p>"A soul attack?" Luo Luo Zheng sneered. After warding off Johanson's murderous soul attack, a grayish spike was formed in his mind. The spike shot out from between Luo Zheng's eyebrows and lunged straight at Johanson.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the broken flying knife also appeared in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>A broken flying knife!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attack strategy was very similar to Johanson's two-step assassinating method!</p>

  <p>They both exploited the soul attack to unsettle the mind of their opponent, and then, took advantage of his disoriented state to assassinate him with a knife.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had chosen not to use this method until now because, on one hand, he hoped to hide his ace card till the final stage, and on the other hand, this method was Luo Zheng's killing move.</p>

  <p>In light of the sharpness of the broken flying knife, Luo Luo Zheng was afraid that he might lose control and kill someone by accident!</p>

  <p>It was true that the contenders in the arena would try their best to win. In such competitive situations, some participants would occasionally be seriously injured or even die.</p>

  <p>However, given that the arena was not a real battlefield, Luo Luo Zheng let his values and morals guide him.</p>

  <p>In this situation, however, Luo Luo Zheng had decided to use his killing method, as from the start, he had sensed that Johanson was determined to kill him.</p>

  <p>The minute the battle began, Johanson had established that he was not aiming at defeating Luo Luo Zheng, but he wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>As to how to distinguish good from the evil, Luo Luo Zheng had a simple belief? if others treated him well, he would also be friendly toward them.</p>

  <p>However, if others intended to murder him, he would return the favor!</p>

  <p>'Being kind to your enemy means being cruel to yourself!'</p>

  <p>Although Vale, his opponent in the previous fight, was very obnoxious, Luo Luo Zheng did not detect any trace of murderous intent from Vale! Vale was merely seeking to subdue Luo Luo Zheng and to thwart his martial arts aspirations.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng decided to be merciful toward Vale, and even gave him a helping hand when he deviated into madness!</p>
