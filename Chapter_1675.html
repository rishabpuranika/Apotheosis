<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Janet was worried, her face did not reveal it.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Ji Clan, she could not do or say anything to displease and disappoint her clan members.</p>

  <p>"Meow..." the flame kitten in her hand meowed softly.</p>

  <p>She had explored for treasures in the Hall of Causality, but in the end, she only duplicated and received a flame kitten. This had resulted in her being ruthlessly scolded by her father. How could she dare to speak up now?</p>

  <p>In short, the members of the Ji Clan were still optimistic about their chances.</p>

  <p>Warriors in the universe estimated that Zheng's strength was equal to that of an ace talent. However, Lucille and Cindy were both top ace talents. The power they possessed rivalled that of the Godly Genius, and they were also capable of showcasing their internal momentum. Thus, in their eyes, Luo Zheng was still far from able to contend with them.</p>

  <p>The only troublesome matter pertained to the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>The stone was lightly placed on the board.</p>

  <p>As it landed, Cindy saw Luo Zheng not far away from her. With her lips pursed, she gently grasped her long dress in one hand as if crossing a stream. She carefully jumped down from the stone, her face slightly flushed.</p>

  <p>Anyone who saw her could tell that she was a little nervous.</p>

  <p>"Hello..."</p>

  <p>Cindy nodded at Luo Zheng as a form of greeting.</p>

  <p>Those who did not know Cindy were visibly confused.</p>

  <p>This woman did not look like she was stepping onto the battle ring, but instead it was like she was going on a blind date. Was there really a need to be so courteous and nervous?</p>

  <p>However, Cindy had always been like this. Lucille, Nathan, and the other warriors who knew her well enough were used to it.</p>

  <p>She was shy and reserved, but her behavior was always rather confusing.</p>

  <p>However, her true strength was unmatched.</p>

  <p>"Hello." Upon seeing his opponent greet him in such a manner, Luo Zheng was a bit stunned.</p>

  <p>However, if others were polite to him, he paid his respects too. He bowed to Cindy with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>"Do you like peach blossoms..." Cindy was blabbering. She blushed, clearly nervous.</p>

  <p>Standing on top of the stone, Margaret's mouth twitched when she saw the scene. "Is this woman insane? What does she mean by that? Why is she so shy?"</p>

  <p>Tianming wore a smile on his face and did not utter a word.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng was also a bit speechless. However, he still forced a smile and said, "Peach blossoms fall like red rain. They are very beautiful. I, of course, like them..."</p>

  <p>"Hmm." Cindy pursed her lips and nodded. "I like them too..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled slightly. He stared at the attractive woman in front of him and asked, "And?"</p>

  <p>"And..." Cindy thought for a moment before continuing, "I like peach blossoms because of a dream I had not so long ago. I could share it with you!"</p>

  <p>"What will you share with me?"</p>

  <p>"My dream!"</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, Cindy gently waved her hand.</p>

  <p>A wisp of pink life vitality poured out of it.</p>

  <p>The life vitality formed a faint vortex in the air, enveloping the entire board...</p>

  <p>The board was dyed with the wonderful pink color in an instant.</p>

  <p>This was Cindy's dreamland.</p>

  <p>A wise man in ancient times had reached the Godly Way through one dream alone.</p>

  <p>That was not a legend, but the truth.</p>

  <p>The wise man was called Braydon.</p>

  <p>He belonged to the Blessed Buddha Land, but since the humans had not been divided into different forces at that time, the Blessed Buddha Land had not then been established.</p>

  <p>When Braydon became a Godly Genius, he had only been a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>He wanted to become a disciple of the Hidden Spirit Temple which had been famous at the time. However, he could not enter the temple upon arriving. The Hidden Spirit Temple was now the top-level temple of the Blessed Buddha Land and ordinary warriors were not eligible to enter it.</p>

  <p>At that time, Braydon had not been so talented and therefore was unable to enter the temple.</p>

  <p>However, he believed that if he set his mind on it with the utmost sincerity, the temple's members would understand his sincere aspiration and accept him. Thus, he was unwilling to leave easily.</p>

  <p>Millions of warriors had guarded the Hidden Spirit Temple for several years, but they were still not allowed to enter it.</p>

  <p>One day, Braydon was tired and fell asleep in front of the Hidden Spirit Temple.</p>

  <p>That was when he had a dream. The life vitality in his body circulated one lap by another, slowly spreading and drawing the outline of his dreamland.</p>

  <p>The members of the Hidden Spirit Temple were about to drive him away when they saw him asleep at the gate.</p>

  <p>However, those in Braydon's vicinity were trapped in his dream, unable to get any closer to him or leave the dream altogether.</p>

  <p>At long last, he attracted the attention of the temple's masters.</p>

  <p>The masters could not figure out what was happening. After rescuing the trapped warriors from the dreamland, they asked them not to approach Braydon again and let him stay at the temple gate.</p>

  <p>Braydon slept there for three hundred years.</p>

  <p>All this time, the humans were aware that a warrior slept in front of the Hidden Spirit Temple, displaying no signs of waking up.</p>

  <p>In Braydon's dreamland, at times everything was covered in ice and snow, other times countless stars twinkled in the skies, and sometimes raging fires enveloped the entire land.</p>

  <p>Braydon cultivated in his dream. He also tried his best to comprehend and receive insights there.</p>

  <p>His dream lasted for three hundred years. By the time he woke up, he had become a True God.</p>

  <p>As he cultivated in the dream, his cultivation base also increased gradually.</p>

  <p>What he comprehended was the Dream Godly Way, which was a powerful one among the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Later, the Hidden Spirit Temple labelled Braydon as the Sleeping Arhat and made a giant statue for him, so Braydon gained his position in the temple as an arhat.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Cindy drew Luo Zheng into the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>In the Emerald Dream, peach blossoms fell like red rain. It was a sight to behold.</p>

  <p>"The dream seems so real!"</p>

  <p>Even though Cindy had told him that this was her dream, it was hard for Luo Zheng to ascertain that it was not reality.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Space...</p>

  <p>He was in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Zheng had perceived the Illusion Battlefield as being so real. He had assumed that the fifty supreme worlds in the battlefield truly existed in the universe.</p>

  <p>However, later when he came to learn more about the battlefield, he realized that the supreme worlds were just illusory spaces created by the heavens.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder why Cindy's dreamland looked so real.</p>

  <p>In the dream, Cindy slowly walked up to him, a small wooden sword in her hand...</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Luo Zheng started to be vigilant, and as he raised his hand, the Saint Killing Spear appeared in it.</p>

  <p>He had entered this woman's dream, which was not an ideal start for him.</p>

  <p>In fact, almost everyone in the universe saw her dreamland. It was a pink space with countless pretty peach blossoms falling left and right.</p>

  <p>However, only a few warriors could see though this dream.</p>

  <p>What they saw instead was the truth, not the dream. They saw Cindy holding her knees and putting her head on them, a small smile on her face. She was inside her dream at this moment.</p>

  <p>They also saw Luo Zheng lying on the ground, asleep in an unsightly posture.</p>

  <p>Only less than five hundred warriors could see this scene, which included the Supreme Lords and some world lords.</p>

  <p>Since Cindy could create the Emerald Dream, it meant that she was close to the Dream Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In the Emerald Dream, Cindy was omnipotent and in control of everything.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has been unlucky this time. He became Cindy's opponent in his first round of elimination itself..."</p>

  <p>"Cindy is omnipotent in her dream. Her position in the dream is like the status of the heavens in the universe. If Luo Zheng can't see through it, he will not be able to defeat her!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is in danger..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum said flatly. Yolande, who stood beside him, looked worried. She wondered if Luo Zheng would be eliminated this time.</p>

  <p>Cindy, who stood opposite Luo Zheng, wielded the wooden sword in her hand to casually hack at the falling peach blossoms, as if playing with them.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he looked even more wary.</p>

  <p>"So beautiful, right?"</p>

  <p>Cindy, who had been shy at the beginning, looked confident and outgoing in the Emerald Dream. Her pair of bright eyes were enticing, her face pretty and alluring. She glanced around leisurely, looking as beautiful as a fairy.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the person or the peach blossoms?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Cindy giggled as she covered her mouth, and then said, "Of course I mean the peach blossoms! Aren't they beautiful?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted the Saint Killing Spear and stared at Cindy. "Be it the peach blossoms, or be it you... Both are beautiful."</p>

  <p>"If only we would stay in this dream forever," Cindy said, sighing happily.</p>

  <p>"It is beautiful here, but it is just a dream. Why should we linger in this illusion?" Luo Zheng asked seriously.</p>

  <p>"But you have no choice," Cindy said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"That might not be true!"</p>

  <p>In fact, their battle began when Cindy had started to arrange the dream.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng thrust the spear forward.</p>

  <p>However, Cindy only reached out with her index finger and touched the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear, which could destroy nearly everything, was halted by Cindy's finger.</p>
