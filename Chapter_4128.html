<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Blood oozed out of Othniel's heavily wounded body, which lay on the vast plain.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the mountains collapsed, and the ground cracked. The land caved in as several cities and villages around his body crumbled.</p>

  <p>The remaining survivors looked at his large body in horror. They did not know what happened and thought that the end of the world had come.</p>

  <p>The faces of the Evil Gods who stood on Othniel's body began to blur and shrink back to their original forms. Their minds, which the Evil God had occupied, also returned to their original states.</p>

  <p>They did not die; they didn't know what happened. When they regained their senses, they just stared blankly at the body beneath them.</p>

  <p>"What kind of monster is this?"</p>

  <p>"It's so big!"</p>

  <p>"It's a Chaos Ancient God!"</p>

  <p>There were many knowledgeable men among the crowd.</p>

  <p>They recognized that the injured corpse belonged to the Chaos Ancient God, Othniel.</p>

  <p>Then, did that mean that the Chaos Ancient Gods would also be killed?</p>

  <p>Had the world gone mad?</p>

  <p>The matter confused them, but it did not last long. They quickly realized something and exchanged greedy glances.</p>

  <p>It was the corpse of a Chaos Ancient God! Both his flesh and bones were rare treasures!</p>

  <p>They immediately cut and scraped the body with their bare hands; some of them even fought for it. They were like a group of ants that swarmed a beast's corpse.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the black ship still floated in the air, and an Evil God climbed onto the deck.</p>

  <p>He wore a black armor, which was the uniform of the guards in the Moon Shield City.</p>

  <p>When Shera sensed his presence, she became alert and cautiously asked,</p>

  <p>"Are you... the Evil God?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Evil God said with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>Of course he knew what Shera wanted to ask.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's body already perished. Based on Shera's reaction, the person in front of her was no longer the original Evil God.</p>

  <p>"But you don't... This body is..." Shera said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"From the Source World's perspective, even you are me, and so is the former captain of the Black Ship," the Evil God said and pointed at the two of them. Lastly, he looked at Edna. "But she is not me," he continued.</p>

  <p>He represented the Source World.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everything that was born in the Source World belonged to him.</p>

  <p>However, Edna was not born in the Source World. She came from Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"You are my husband. No one can replace you!" Edna cried as she went up to the Evil God and clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>She already knew that the Evil God had changed his body, but she would always be with him no matter what her husband became. Besides, he still looked the same as before.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. You mean that all the creatures in the Source World can turn into you?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>She knew that the former captain wanted to ask these questions, but the Evil God had always been quite rude to him. After all, the Evil God was cautious around the Grandmaster of Heaven, who supported the captain.</p>

  <p>Thus, she had to communicate with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The creatures born in and live in the Source World can do that," the Evil God answered.</p>

  <p>"No limit to the number?" Shera asked again.</p>

  <p>Shera and the captain had been utterly shocked by the excessive number of Evil Gods.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's physical body did not reach the Eternal Realm. However, because of the Ways-blending Energy, he was more powerful than most of the Holy Soul Realm warriors and almost as strong as the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, over ten thousand top-level Holy Soul Realm warriors already formed a really terrifying force.</p>

  <p>If he turned all the creatures in the Source World into himself, it would be even more unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically, that is the case, but I can't do it now," the Evil God said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>That was because over ten thousand people being transformed into him was his limit.</p>

  <p>The Source World's power was not unlimited. The Evil God could only use a part of it, and it took time to recover if he used it up all at once.</p>

  <p>If he drew more than what was allowed, he and the Source World would suffer considerably.</p>

  <p>"Well, if that is the case, what will you do next?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God suddenly became excited and said, "Of course, I will kill Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the opponent who he could never defeat, and who had controlled his fate several times before.</p>

  <p>He never felt grateful to Luo Zheng for letting him off on multiple occasions.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Luo Zheng's sympathy was his biggest humiliation. Now, he had a chance to wash it all away.</p>

  <p>"But I still have to wait. The power used to kill the Chaos Ancient God needs to be restored, and I still have not completely comprehended the Ways-blending Energy," he added.</p>

  <p>"I just want to get one thing straight. Why do you put so much importance to Luo Zheng?" Shera asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Luo Zheng was powerful and had astounding growth progress.</p>

  <p>But now, the Evil God had even killed the Chaos Ancient God. With his current strength, it would be easy for him to take down the Li Shan mountain and kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Shera and shook his head. "You don't know him," he muttered.</p>

  <p>He had lived in Luo Zheng's inner world for a very long time, so he knew Luo Zheng's capabilities well.</p>

  <p>For him, Luo Zheng was vastly different from any opponent in this world. Even the Chaos Ancient Gods could not compare to him.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, his wife begged to differ. "Could you please let Luo Zheng off? He treated us well," Edna pleaded.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Evil God gently stroked her black hair and explained, "Of course I can let him off, but he has to become my vassal. I will make him someone that is powerful and can control many things in the Source World, just as I did in his inner world back then!"</p>

  <p>"You know that he would not accept that," Edna said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"Then he can only be a part of me," the Evil God deadpanned.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit's eyeball was filled with indescribable rage.</p>

  <p>He saw everything that had happened through the eyeballs on the foreheads of Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>A mistake...</p>

  <p>He had made the biggest mistake...</p>

  <p>He never imagined that the Evil God had controlled the Source World to such an extent in only a short time!</p>

  <p>Back then, Usman followed the Black Ship for a long time after he was born. However, his power couldn't compare to the Evil God's.</p>

  <p>Although the Divine Dao energy was gone, it was not a big deal, as the Element Spirit Civilization was not held responsible. But now, even the Source World had fallen into the Evil God's hands.</p>

  <p>"Eye Spirit, why didn't you tell me to take action again?" asked Claire.</p>

  <p>"Even I can't kill him myself, let alone you," said the Eye Spirit. "Why did such a unique power fall into his hands? The Grandmaster of Heaven is so lucky," he lamented.</p>

  <p>"I think the Evil God was born rebellious, and even the Grandmaster of Heaven can't control him. Furthermore, he and the Li Shan mountain will fight.</p>

  <p>Since he killed Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer, he will surely invade the Li Shan mountain!" Claire exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I hope so. Claire, You can leave now, I'll report this to the Snake Master," the Eye Spirit sighed.</p>

  <p>Claire glanced helplessly at the Eye Spirit. Since such a thing had happened, the Snake Master would probably punish her leader again.</p>

  <p>After she left, a golden rune appeared in the Eye Spirit's eyeball and immediately turned into three cross-shaped stars. The stars gathered together, and then Sewell's coordinates were complete.</p>

  <p>Then, a small white snake came out from the coordinates.</p>

  <p>"Master Sewell," said the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Sewell twirled around, and faced him. "Why did you summon me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In return, the Eye Spirit briefly explained what had happened to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Sewell was utterly shocked and speechless.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had always executed the Snake Masters' control of the chaos for a long time. Their arrangement had been stable and rarely went out of control.</p>

  <p>When the Eye Spirit had reported that the Evil God had devoured Usman last time, Sewell did not take it seriously.</p>

  <p>An outsider could only use a small amount of power in the primitive land at most. They could not control the primitive land entirely, and such a thing had never happened before.</p>

  <p>However, the tables had turned over now. Everything related to what had happened exceeded Sewell's expectations.</p>
