<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was very dangerous for martial artists to expose themselves in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>A single Roaring Token that could be used infinitely was enough to cause many Supreme Lords to fight over it.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng didn't even hesitate to transmit his voice using Roaring Token. He was obviously ready to throw caution to the wind.</p>

  <p>Xun knew that Luo Zheng still had the fairy palace to rely on. However, Yao, as well as many Supreme Lords, had tailed him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could easily compete with Spirit Supreme Realm powerhouses with his strength. But what if he faced those Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists? Or world lords? Or Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>There wouldn't be an option for Luo Zheng to retreat if that happened. He was too impulsive.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the type of person to bother about those things though. He just followed his heart regardless of how dangerous his decisions were. He was ready to pay any price.</p>

  <p>Looking at the corpses of Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca, and Elspeth, he asked, "How should we deal with them?"</p>

  <p>Xun sighed lightly and replied, "Keep their corpses for the time being. If I can return to the Demon Night one day, I'll bury them in the queens' tomb."</p>

  <p>One of the highest honors a martial artist of Demon Night could get was to be buried in the queens' tomb. Only the greatest martial artists and those who had made special contributions to the Demon Night could be buried there.</p>

  <p>Although Xun couldn't bury them in the tomb now, it didn't mean she wouldn't be able to do it in the future.</p>

  <p>World lords' corpses would not rot even after ten thousand years. It wouldn't be difficult to store them away. Following Xun's instructions, Luo Zheng carefully stored the four corpses.</p>

  <p>Xun then floated at the end of the Reincarnation Plate and stopped before a spear.</p>

  <p>Salvador had thrown out his spear before killing himself. Now it was stuck on the surface of the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>"This is the North Dawn Spear. It was forged from the north dawn crystal. I gave this to Salvador. I didn't expect that he still used it after such a long time," she muttered.</p>

  <p>The North Dawn Spear was only a first-rank divine weapon. Although it was on the list of the Spirit Tablet, its rank was not high. It was ranked around seven thousandth.</p>

  <p>In reality, Salvador had the ability to acquire a supreme divine weapon when he was still alive. However, he chose to stay with this spear for a long time.</p>

  <p>Xun stretched her hand to take out the North Dawn Spear. She stroke it gently, running her delicate fingers to its shaft. Not long after, a soft smile appeared on her face as she turned around and placed the spear into Zheng's space ring.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate continued to fly deep into space.</p>

  <p>There were 100, 000 supreme worlds in the universe and the deep space was all the same across it. However, as the angles were different, the arrangements of the stars were slightly different.</p>

  <p>After returning to the hall of the Reincarnation Plate, Xun said,</p>

  <p>"Let's head north."</p>

  <p>"North?" asked Luo Zheng curiously.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded slightly. "Yes."</p>

  <p>She remembered that Salvador said something to her before he killed himself. He mentioned about the South Heaven Ferry.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time ago when Xun went to the South Heaven Ferry to train with Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca, and Elspeth.</p>

  <p>Salvador's cultivation base was still low back then. He said that he would leave behind all the disputes and roam in the universe once his cultivation base developed.</p>

  <p>"Where do you want to go the most?" Xun asked Salvador once.</p>

  <p>Thinking for a moment, Salvador then pointed to the sky and gestured to the most dazzling star at the South Heaven Ferry. "The Northern Twilight Star."</p>

  <p>On more than one occasion, Salvador had said that his first destination once he traveled the universe would be the Northern Twilight Star.</p>

  <p>The South Heaven Ferry was located in the depths of hundreds of supreme worlds of the Demon Night. Although Salvador mentioned the South Heaven Ferry, he never really asked Xun to head there.</p>

  <p>Instead, his true destination was the Northern Twilight Star.</p>

  <p>He couldn't tell the truth since Yao had been keeping her eyes on him.</p>

  <p>Thus, Xun was asking Luo Zheng to turn the Reincarnation Plate and head straight for Northern Twilight Star now.</p>

  <p>As Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth were already dead, they had survived Yao's first wave of attacks. Neither Luo Zheng nor Xun felt at ease.</p>

  <p>Yao was extremely cruel and merciless. She definitely wouldn't let them off so easily. There would certainly be even more powerful pursuers following them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would need to get himself ready in advance since nobody could tell when Yao's next round of attacks happened.</p>

  <p>He was controlling the Reincarnation Plate, letting Freya once again enter the third and fourth caves of the Endless Abyss. Freya was getting all the treasures left behind by the Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>There were many defensive treasures in the third cave and all sorts of rare materials for weapon refining in the fourth cave. A huge part of these materials came from the previous grand era and many of them had disappeared in the current grand era. Nonetheless, they were all extremely important in the eyes of Livingston.</p>

  <p>After the preparations were made, the token of mountain appeared in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>To be exact, the token of mountain was not something for transmission.</p>

  <p>It did not simply transmit Luo Zheng. It was actually the fairy palace itself, or it could be said to be a projection of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The token glowed faintly when Luo Zheng poured a bit of his life vitality into it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it began to twist and transform into a piece of melted wax. Finally, it transformed into a palm-sized mini fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Xun had seen Luo Zheng use the token of mountain before. Thus, she was not surprised at all. However, at this moment, Freya and Livingston were quite curious.</p>

  <p>Livingston was wide-eyed while looking at the token. As the most powerful weapon refiner in the previous grand era, his life wasn't simply just about refining weapons. He had wide experience and extensive knowledge of a lot of things. Nonetheless, he did not expect Zheng's token to change forms. It greatly shocked him.</p>

  <p>"What? What the hell is this?"</p>

  <p>Livingston couldn't tell what material the token was made of. In addition to the extremely special Space Law, there seemed to be many types of Law of Causality that he had never heard before.</p>

  <p>Although the Law of Causality in every round of heavens was different, they were largely identical with only minor differences. It would allow Livingston to see through even the supreme divine weapons under this round of the heavens.</p>

  <p>But then, this mini fairy palace was clearly beyond his understanding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently threw the fairy palace onto the ground, and then it began to rapidly expand.</p>

  <p>In the end, the palm-sized fairy palace grew into an area eighty feet long and eighty feet wide. Compared to Zheng's height, the fairy palace was still very small. For example, the walls of the fairy palace were just to Zheng's chest, making it look like an artificial miniature scenic spot.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was enough for Luo Zheng and the others to enter.</p>

  <p>"Let's go in." After Luo Zheng finished speaking, he walked through the small door of the fairy palace and instantly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Livingston, Freya, and Xun followed him.</p>

  <p>The instant they entered, the scenery around them underwent a tremendous change. The originally small fairy palace suddenly became incomparably tall and the towering walls rose up more than thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>Freya curiously looked around. The fairy palace was very new to her.</p>

  <p>She couldn't figure out where Luo Zheng came from. How could a Soul Sea Realm martial artist have such a fairy palace like this?</p>

  <p>"This... This fairy palace..." Livingston's face was filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Freya, on the other hand, couldn't contain her curiosity. She knew that the fairy palace was extraordinary but she couldn't see anything special about it.</p>

  <p>However, Livingston was different.</p>

  <p>When his gaze landed on the walls of the fairy palace, the two rays of light on his head began to flicker.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Livingston stepped forward rapidly. It was hard to imagine how an old puppet could move so fast.</p>

  <p>Then, he threw himself onto a wall, stretched out his claw and gently drew a line on the cyan brick.</p>

  <p>The brick was not very sturdy. As Livingston scratched it with his claw made of metal, a shallow groove was left. Surprisingly, a moment later, the groove started to wiggle and returned to normal.</p>

  <p>"This, this is... A cyan brick made of light peace sand!" Excitement was flooding Livingston's face. He took two steps back, looked at the wall which was thousands of feet tall, and exclaimed with even more excitement, "The whole wall is made of light peace sand!"</p>

  <p>Freya asked curiously, "What is light peace sand?" In her eyes, this was just an ordinary cyan brick.</p>

  <p>"It is the best material! That is impossible! I dare say no one is able to gather so much light peace sand throughout the universe. Ha! I'm going crazy!" Livingston seemed to be unable to control his emotions.</p>
