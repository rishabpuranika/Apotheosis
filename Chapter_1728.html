<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1728 A Godly Plate </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Xuanyuan Clan placed this Heavenly Fragment in Nathan's body for his own, personal purpose.</p>

  <p>If Nathan used it now, then he would ruin everything!</p>

  <p>The young man slowly came to. His anger gradually dissipated as he slowly calmed himself down.</p>

  <p>Losing this battle wasn't the end of his life. As the saying went, "Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans."</p>

  <p>His future remained bright.</p>

  <p>Nathan held the Heavenly Fragment in his hand. By the time he stretched it out, the fragment had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I admit defeat," he said through clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>This was the very first time these words had ever been uttered by Nathan's lips.</p>

  <p>He was someone who never admitted defeat. In fact, you could say that he was born as a winner.</p>

  <p>Nathan was born with the destiny of being this grand era's main character. If everything went according to the fate, then he would've been the one who won first place in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had become the biggest variable in changing his fate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled, obviously pleased with his victory. In a flash, he flew in the air and threw the broken sword towards Lone. A white light flashed and his body disappeared from the stone.</p>

  <p>Nine people remained in the picture scroll.</p>

  <p>These nine would still have to fight to decide their rankings.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Nathan still had to fight for second place. Shania and Kurt were also set to battle, along with Lucille and Lawson.</p>

  <p>However, their battles had nothing to do with Luo Zheng, who was now the ultimate victor of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" Mu Ning shouted in fury the moment Luo Zheng vanished. Why did he disappear so quickly?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no time to face her anger. Right now, he traversed through a patch of white clouds so thick, it almost blocked his sight completely.</p>

  <p>Ever since entering the Illusion Battlefield, he had always wondered what kind of place it exactly was.</p>

  <p>It covered fifty supreme worlds created by the heavens. Could it be a battlefield within the heavens? Or was it just an illusion?</p>

  <p>A huge shadow streaked across the clouds, then the second, and then the third...</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>The shadow streaks appeared here and there before finally appearing in Zheng's line of sight.</p>

  <p>The shadows turned out to be many massive mountains identical in size, shape, and appearance.</p>

  <p>On top of each mountain were many round, stone pillars very similar to the Hall of Causality Luo Zheng had seen before.</p>

  <p>"You can take one of the Godly Plates first," the mysterious girl said in Zheng's ear.</p>

  <p>This girl's voice was usually very cold, as if she was a mere disembodied statue.</p>

  <p>However, she was extremely pleasant and casual when she talked to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A Godly Plate?" he asked. Upon approaching a mountain, he discovered a milky white disc floating along the enormous stone pillars.</p>

  <p>Was this what he had fought for?</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flickered. If one could hold a Godly Tile on a Godly Plate, then why couldn't those Supreme Lords obtain one?</p>

  <p>He arrived just in front of the disc. He looked at it carefully and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Eh?"</p>

  <p>The Godly Plate didn't really look so godly. In fact, it looked like an ordinary plate made of some unknown material. However, Luo Zheng could feel that it held an extremely stable power.</p>

  <p>What was the most peculiar though was that the thing formed by Zheng's chaotic energy in his chaotic sea during his fight with Tianming was almost exactly the same as this Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>It was very strange.</p>

  <p>Could it be that his chaotic energy temporarily became a Godly Plate?</p>

  <p>Or perhaps that cross-shaped crystal in his inner world was actually a Godly Tile?</p>

  <p>Just as he thought about this, the mysterious girl's voice spoke in his ear.</p>

  <p>"What are you standing there for? You can take it!"</p>

  <p>Her words of affirmation were enough for Luo Zheng. He reached out and gently touched the disc. As he did, it began to rotate slowly, getting smaller and smaller. Once it reached the size of a thumb, it stopped and zoomed into Zheng's belly.</p>

  <p>Using his inner vision, Luo Zheng watched as the Godly Plate floated within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Now a World Tree and a Godly Plate were inside his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations Luo Zheng! You won first place! Do you have any more questions to ask me? I'll make an exception and let you ask three questions," the mysterious girl said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng already knew what he wanted to ask. "Is there any news about Yan?"</p>

  <p>The girl was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>He had already asked this question a hundred times, perhaps more, over the years.</p>

  <p>"Can you ask another question?" she replied, obviously tired of hearing this same old question from him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. It was the thing that concerned him the most and yet she refused to answer.</p>

  <p>"What is your name? Who exactly are you?"</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl was once again silent. It was obvious that she was hesitating whether or not she should answer.</p>

  <p>"My name is Irene Jiang. What's your next question?"</p>

  <p>"Irene, do you have any news about Yan?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>'What the hell?!' Irene Jiang cursed in her head.</p>

  <p>'Why must he always ask that question? He's a great storyteller but he is actually so boring.' She was extremely conflicted at that moment and could do nothing but remain silent.</p>

  <p>However, her silence ignited a sliver of hope in Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>"You must know where she is. According to the agreement, I am entitled to know," Luo Zheng insisted.</p>

  <p>Irene Jiang sighed, "I don't think it's a good idea to tell you the truth."</p>

  <p>She didn't think that finding Yan was going to be a difficult task at first.</p>

  <p>However, that was before she found out just what exactly that young woman managed to get herself into. To make it short, Yan was in the hands of a bunch of madmen. Getting Luo Zheng involved with them was certainly not going to be a good thing.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng remained stubborn. "I must know."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you that she is indeed in the divine land, but that's it. No more," Irene Jiang said firmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled at her words. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>He had never met this woman before. The only communication he had with her was through the Roaring Token whenever he told her stories.</p>

  <p>The information she provided him was far from enough.</p>

  <p>How was Yan doing? Which part of the divine land was she in?</p>

  <p>These were the things he needed to know. However, just knowing she was in the divine land was enough for now.</p>

  <p>That place was still unreachable for Luo Zheng. He would need to step over the heavens if he wanted to go there.</p>

  <p>Despite getting the first place in the Illusion Battlefield, he knew that this oncoming task was still going to be a bit challenging for him.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he was set to receive another reward. Luo Zheng, along with the second and third place winners, would receive an extremely useful gift— the modification of their fates.</p>

  <p>In other words, Zheng's luck was about to be changed.</p>

  <p>Enhancing his luck was going to be extremely useful to Luo Zheng especially during times when he would need to rely on probabilities.</p>

  <p>He had always been quite lucky especially when he had devoured those Luck-devouring Snakes. However, the peak of his luck only lasted for a short period of time. He hadn't seized the opportunity at that time.</p>

  <p>Practicing the Stellar Body when his luck reached its limit would be an easier task.</p>

  <p>His current luck wasn't as good as when he consumed those Luck-devouring Snakes.</p>

  <p>Changing one's luck was no easy task. It must be an ability that only the heavens possessed, right?</p>

  <p>This Irene Jiang seemed to be the one in charge of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng didn't really know who she was or what role she played exactly. She wasn't someone who could casually interfere with how the heavens did things.</p>

  <p>With his questions done, Luo Zheng waited on top of the mountain for the arrival of the next warrior.</p>

  <p>It was quite a while before another person emerged from the white mist.</p>

  <p>The man was tall and had a heroic expression on his face. It was none other than Tianming!</p>

  <p>The first to win would be the first to enter the clouds and take a Godly Plate. Since Tianming was the second, then that could only mean that he managed to defeat Nathan.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, Nathan came walking after Tianming. His expression was extremely foul since he only got third place.</p>

  <p>Shania ranked fourth while Kurt ranked fifth.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, she managed to get tenth place.</p>

  <p>If the ranking had been based purely on strength, she would've ranked higher.</p>

  <p>However, after entering the top ten, she decided to just concede all the way, hence her low ranking.</p>

  <p>She gazed up at the mountains and wanted to fly towards Luo Zheng. However, she couldn't get close. All Mu Ning could do was give up and cry in bitter regret. 'I should've told him to meet in the Purple Power World, ' she thought to herself.</p>
