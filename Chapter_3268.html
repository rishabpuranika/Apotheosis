<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3268 Ruling Forces </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Compared to the other great races, the Ear Mice had an unparalleled advantage in this aspect.</p>

  <p>After all, they were involved in most of the deals on the Other Shore. They knew the whereabouts of the Other Shore Keys as well as the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>For the past ten years, the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was rarely encountered. Only three were ever sold. However, when the anomaly appeared behind the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice immediately located a creature that possessed the key and bought the key for a steep price.</p>

  <p>As they reached the end of the Grand Sky Temple, they found a wall blocking their way. Seeing this, they felt disheartened.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light were not able to cross the wall.</p>

  <p>Later on, the Ear Mice quickly came up with another plan. They began to spread the news. Soon enough, all the major forces in the Source World found out about the anomaly of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Their goal was to earn more soul pills. Because there was no Soul of Light that could break the wall down, they wouldn't be able to enter the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>But a few days ago, they heard news from Stage Four and Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>This allowed the Ear Mice to change their strategy once more.</p>

  <p>The man in front of them gave them hope that the wall could be torn down.</p>

  <p>The Grand Sky Temple was enormous. It was a hundred times larger than the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Dorothy followed the Ear Mice into the hall. There they saw a huge statue in front of them.</p>

  <p>The statue was sixty feet tall. It had an eagle head and a bear body. It emanated an extraordinary aura.</p>

  <p>"Is this the race that built the Grand Sky Temple?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice nodded and said, "The Grand Sky race was a powerful race. They could be considered as a ruling force."</p>

  <p>"A ruling force?" Luo Zheng blinked in wonderment.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Any powerful race that has ruled the entire chaos can be called a ruling force," the Ear Mouse laughed. "The current super powers in the Source World are simply too weak compared to them."</p>

  <p>Although the Source World was relatively peaceful now, there were various forces that struggled for supremacy. There had never been a ruling force.</p>

  <p>There were many super powers that existed.</p>

  <p>These included the Separate Abyss race, the Li Shan mountain, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>There was a great gap between these super powers. However, none of them was able to control the entire Source World, let alone the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse's statement reminded Luo Zheng of the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>"How about the Dreaded Eye Demons of the Sacred Mallow Temple?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They can also be considered as a ruling force," answered the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, they still can't compare to the Grand Sky race. The races that were able to build their temples on the Other Shore used to be ruling forces."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Luo Zheng questioned No. 9527 in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Perhaps you can say that but only because it's how the Ear Mice define the forces. The Chaos Ancient Gods are above all those forces," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>The creature that could control the truth was the true master of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought of what he had just said outside the temple. Somehow, he felt confused. He asked the Ear Mouse, "Did the Grand Sky race follow the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." The Ear Mouse nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks like they also failed." A look of regret registered upon Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Both the Dreaded Eye Demons and the Grand Sky race had been able to control the entire chaos. They could summon more resources and they might be even more powerful. But in the end, they couldn't escape that needle.</p>

  <p>"You are living in too much pain. In addition, you have only repeated the path of the predecessors. Before the Finale Way is realized, you have to rely on us for everything," the Ear Mouse said.</p>

  <p>"What? We have to rely on you?" Luo Zheng was stunned by this.</p>

  <p>Dorothy also blinked in shock.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were the most mediocre super force in the Source World.</p>

  <p>They didn't seem to have any other needs except earning divine crystals and soul pills.</p>

  <p>They could just exchange powerful Other Shore Tokens, rare Other Shore Keys, and a large sum of soul pills for divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Other than being used as a currency, the divine crystals could only be used to replenish the energy of the Other Shore Tokens. The Ear Mice's obsession with the divine crystals had always been incomprehensible to the other races.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak!"</p>

  <p>Several Ear Mice squeaked to change the topic.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse talking with Luo Zheng gave a wicked smile and promptly changed the subject.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Luo Zheng and Dorothy understood. Regardless, a super power would definitely not be as simple as they thought. The Ear Mice should not be underestimated either.</p>

  <p>They bypassed the statue and continued towards the end of the hall where there were nineteen arched doors.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng and Dorothy's first time to visit here. Naturally, they didn't know what the doors meant.</p>

  <p>"All of the nineteen arched doors lead to the same destination, but they differ in their difficulty. The thirteenth and seventeenth ones are death roads. The seventh one is the simplest while the nineteenth one is the most difficult. The Souls of Light that went inside had a slim chance of surviving; however, many of them had discovered some powerful Other Shore Tokens there." The information provided by the Ear Mouse was worth more than 100, 000 soul pills. The more they knew about the temple, the more hope they would have for survival after all.</p>

  <p>With that, it asked Luo Zheng, "Which arched door will you choose?"</p>

  <p>It left the decision up to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to choose the nineteenth one," answered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There weren't many things that could threaten Luo Zheng on the Other Shore. In the first place, he had already planned on finding Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he wouldn't let go of this great opportunity.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice glanced at each other. They didn't know much about what was behind the nineteenth door. They only knew that this path was very dangerous. But this time, Luo Zheng was leading the way. Thus, they would have the chance to find some high-grade Other Shore Tokens as well.</p>

  <p>"Well then, let's go." The Ear Mice believed in Luo Zheng's strength. They agreed without much hesitation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked in the front followed by Dorothy and the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>There was a long and narrow semi-circular passageway behind the arch.</p>

  <p>The ceiling of the passageway was bumpy and uneven. It was covered with lines that resembled the blood vessels of a human body. The faint red light emitted by the lines was flickering. Sometimes it was bright and sometimes dim. It was just like the rhythm of breathing.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng entered the passageway, he didn't feel anything uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Dorothy who was behind him, however, suddenly felt very unwell.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy couldn't help but wrap her arms around herself. She leaned against Luo Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng turned his head and asked in concern.</p>

  <p>He didn't worry about his own safety but he had to protect Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"I feel like my soul force is fading away," Dorothy answered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the Ear Mice and one of them said, "After we enter the Grand Sky Temple, our soul force will constantly drain. This is the rule of this temple. Before we enter the passageway, it drains very slowly. But now, it is depleted faster. You can take soul pills to replenish it."</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded and took out some soul pills. She took them to replenish her soul force.</p>

  <p>She brought a lot of soul pills with her so the lost soul force was not a problem for her at all.</p>
