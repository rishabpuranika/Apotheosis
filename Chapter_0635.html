<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 635 Puzzled Tia (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Felix nodded. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng with an amazed expression on his face as if he had found a priceless thing.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Felix really admired Tia for her sharp insight. Tia was right. Luo Luo Zheng was really outstanding and it was worth cultivating him at any cost.</p>

  <p>As the top runic expert in the Cloud Hall, he and the others had heard a lot about Luo Luo Zheng. They clearly knew that it was Tia who made Luo Luo Zheng challenge the Elite House disciples.</p>

  <p>Since Tia was quite young, a lot of elders secretly blamed her. They all said that she had made a big mistake. What Tia actually meant to do was to make all the Elite House disciples serve as practice targets for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng had such amazing talents, was he worth being cultivated like this?</p>

  <p>Because Tia was short-tempered, most elders didn't tell her off to her face and secretly complained about her instead. Although Tia was still at the Illuminating Soul Realm due to her cultivation method, the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, there was still someone very powerful backing her in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Before, Felix also secretly agreed with the elders. He was even reluctant to accept this task that Tia asked him to do. Why would he bother to destroy Luo Zheng's confidence in learning how to draw runes. It was selfish of Tia to do so. She had used so many resources for Luo Zheng's cultivation, as if the Cloud Hall belonged to Luo Luo Zheng himself!</p>

  <p>But now, Felix was sincerely convinced by Tia.</p>

  <p>It was really worth to cultivate Luo Luo Zheng with all of the Cloud Hall's resources. But Tia had only used the Elite House and just one person, Morphens to do so, which he now thought was not enough.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng happily put the runic pen into his space ring. He came to the market today and gained a lot. He had not only sold out all the divine textures he had made yesterday for good prices, but also obtained an excellent runic bush pen. How could he not be happy about it?</p>

  <p>"Many thanks to you guys," Luo Luo Zheng said to them with a smile, and left.</p>

  <p>Felix and Lasseter glanced at each other. Both of them realized how precious Luo Luo Zheng was. Lasseter paid more attention to Luo Zheng's commercial value, while Felix thought about how Luo Luo Zheng could be useful to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't have much conflict, but they had different interests. The World Commercial Alliance was called the uncrowned king in this world. Although Luo Luo Zheng was a disciple of the Cloud Hall, they could not stop Luo Luo Zheng from having a good relationship with the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Felix left the shop hurriedly and flew toward the ice palace as quickly as light.</p>

  <p>The ice palace was located at the top of the Cloud Hall. It was covered with freezing fog now. The little ice phoenix stood guard at the gate of the ice palace. It was time for Tia to cultivate herself.</p>

  <p>The Sutra of Empyrean Goddess was difficult to practice. One had to give up his cultivation all nine times in a row. In each time, one must start cultivation from the nature level. Then, the cultivation level would be improved bit by bit until it reached the Internal Elixir Realm. After that, it must be given up again. This must be repeated nine times.</p>

  <p>This meant Tia needed to cultivate herself nine times unlike others who only needed to do this once.</p>

  <p>Some cultivators without such an excellent talent could not break through the Internal Elixir Realm, even if they had practiced hard for hundreds of years or their whole lives. Moreover, even if they succeeded, most of them would stay in that realm and it was hard for them to improve and reach higher.</p>

  <p>However, finishing all these levels wasn't hard for Tia since she was so talented. Besides, all of her energy meridians had gotten through after she broke through the Internal Elixir Realm by the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess for the first time. So each time Tia gave up her cultivation, she only needed half a year to recover.</p>

  <p>This was the last time Tia had to give up her cultivation. It seemed like she would recover soon. When Tia was in the Cloud Road, she was only at the grade one of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Now only one month had passed, and she was at grade seven of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>She would soon enter the Internal Elixir Realm and even a higher level.</p>

  <p>Tia's head was down as she sat in the ice palace. Wisps of life vitality turned into a frozen Mu Ning, and whirled around her like glittering diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Szzz!"</p>

  <p>A message rune was suddenly sent into the ice palace. It burned itself near Tia's ear.</p>

  <p>Tia frowned slightly. Everyone in the Cloud Hall knew that it was her cultivation time. No one dared to interrupt her unless something significant happened that needed her attention.</p>

  <p>However, after the message rune finished burning itself, Tia's eyes shot open. The ice in her eyes melted and disappeared in her pupils.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand slightly. Soon the freezing fog of the whole ice palace was dispersed and scattered around. Then, it gradually turned into shards of ice on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Please come in," Tia said coldly. However, she also looked confused.</p>

  <p>'What on earth does Felix want to say? He surely knows that I am cultivating myself now and he still used message rune to interrupt me and ask to see me.</p>

  <p>I just asked him to destroy Luo Zheng's confidence in learning making runes.</p>

  <p>Did anything unusual happen?' Tia thought before Felix came in.</p>

  <p>After she started to practice her skills, Tia naturally did not have time to watch the Picture Slab. Thus, she did not know what had happened in Lasseter's shop.</p>
