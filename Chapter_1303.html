  <p>Coincidentally, over a hundred warriors also returned to the gathering place, just as the newcomers were about to leave. These warriors took out all of the life vitality crystals they had obtained and began handing them over.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng saw those life vitality crystals they handed in, he frowned. Although there was a massive amount of them in the pile, their quality wasn't too high; there were just some top-grade life vitality crystals and a few supreme life vitality crystals among the lot. There was even a massive amount of mid-grade life vitality crystals. But he saw no life vitality jade in the piles.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked up and asked, "Friend, may I ask why you only excavated top-grade and mid-grade life vitality crystals? Isn't it too arduous to get these lower grade life vitality crystals? I mean, it would be easier if you got the life vitality jades instead..."</p>

  <p>Everyone's goal was to get one hundred life vitality jades, which was equivalent to a million supreme life vitality crystals. In fact, if they exchanged them for top-grade life vitality crystals, the number would be too enormous. After all, a supreme life vitality crystal could be exchanged for about 100 top-grade life vitality crystals. That was to say, they had to gather one hundred million top-grade life vitality crystals to be free. So whatever the warriors had just brought in was worth ashes and sand.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had arrived in the Upper World with Luo Luo Zheng were also concerned about this issue and they all cast their gazes over to them, full of curiosity and expectations.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the warrior shook his head with a wry smile on his face. "If I don't excavate these things, what else will I mine?" As he spoke, he took a look at Luo Luo Zheng and the others and asked, "Are you guys new here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the other warriors behind him nodded in unison, like a programmed machine.</p>

  <p>The warrior sighed, and then ventured a guess. "If I am right, you all want to dig out the life vitality jades, right?" He then laughed.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with that? It would be easier, right? Is it impossible?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can try to get them." the martial artist chuckled. "When I had just arrived, I also wanted to dig up the life vitality jades so I could leave as soon as possible. But if you want to dig up the life vitality jades, you will have to be ready to lose your lives."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked immediately.</p>

  <p>The martial artist turned around and pointed to the distant mountain range in response, "Look. Here's the deal. If you want to dig up the life vitality jades, you will have to go into the depths of the mineral vein that runs in there. The only problem is, there are eleventh and twelfth grade vicious beasts scattered all over the place. Ordinary warriors simply don't dare go down there to dig up the life vitality jades. It's too risky. These powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm who are trained by the Spiritual Force Sacred Place don't want to take this risk while trying to dig up the life vitality jades themselves. And they also couldn't count on weak warriors to do the task. So they came up with this system for warriors who have just ascended to the Upper World to do the task. Now we have to take the risk if we are in a hurry. But, no life comes cheap. I would rather dig out ordinary life vitality crystals and waste time here than risk my life to get those life vitality jades!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the martial artist's words, the newly arrived warriors finally came to understand the situation.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, life vitality jades were not that easy to obtain and they would have to toil in here only.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Soul Sea Realm who had ascended to this place might be insignificant in this supreme world, but they had still acquired some strength.</p>

  <p>Mining was originally something that was done by the weaker warriors.</p>

  <p>In the Lower World too, it was the same case. Most often, nature creatures, or those at the Illuminating Soul Realm did the mining work.</p>

  <p>The problem was that it was impossible for weak worriers to get in deep enough to dig the life vitality jades and the local warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were unwilling to do it. So they took it for granted that this task should be done by the newcomers who had ascended to this world.</p>

  <p>However, the vast majority of newcomers cherished their lives more than fast freedom. How could they be willing to risk losing them?</p>

  <p>After all, anyone who had reached the Soul Sea Realm was bound to have a long lifespan. At worst, it would only take them thirty to fifty years. Even worse case scenario would be a hundred years to gather all the life vitality crystals they needed.</p>

  <p>The group of warriors who had come here with Luo Luo Zheng had also planned to excavate life vitality jades initially. But when they heard how difficult it was to get them, they immediately gave up on the idea and decided to dig for life vitality crystals instead. At least, they would be safe that way.</p>

  <p>They then left one after the other to start their work. The earlier they started, the faster they could leave this godforsaken place. No one wanted to stay here forever?</p>

  <p>As for the plain-clothed woman, she was holding onto a pickaxe in her hand with a sullen face. The poor girl had expected her uncle to come and pick her up. However, no one had come. She had no choice but to follow the others and take a shot at mining. She looked very depressed indeed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng examined the mountain range from a distance. Once he had put the token and pickaxe in place, he flew towards the mountain range.</p>

  <p>Even though the martial artist he had talked to had said that life vitality jades were very difficult to dig out and that the places where they could be found were very dangerous, Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of giving up. He had a supreme divine weapon that was specifically used for mining and he was going to use that to earn his freedom.</p>
