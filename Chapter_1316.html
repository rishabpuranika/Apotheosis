<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1316 Confusion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With regard to Zheng's cultivation level being only at the Life and Death Realm, Riyad was also a bit curious.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the few followers of the bald warrior described to Riyad earlier about how Luo Zheng had fought yesterday. Luo Zheng seemed to have great strength. He had actually sent the bald man into the mine with a mere slap.</p>

  <p>This strength was enough to make Riyad wary. Therefore, he sent three men to follow Luo Zheng into the mine.</p>

  <p>All three of them were Riyad's best fighters. Although they were also from the Lower World, they were outstanding among the warriors, and their strength was far greater than the ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>Riyad had instructed them to kill Luo Zheng in secret.</p>

  <p>Although the Spiritual Force Sacred Place did not have much control over fighting and killing in the mine, Riyad was always very careful. If he killed too many warriors, the number of life vitality crystals he would have to hand in would decrease. If someone superior was angered, then the armored men who managed the mine would blame Riyad for this.</p>

  <p>Thus, under normal circumstances, Riyad didn't kill people. As long as the warriors obediently handed over their life vitality crystals, he didn't make things difficult for them.</p>

  <p>However, when it was time to act, Riyad did not hesitate in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dared to kill his man, so he must pay with his life. Otherwise, how would Riyad become the leader of the strongest force? How could he get a foothold before so many of his subordinates?</p>

  <p>Freya was still immersed in her doubts and speculations. She carefully thought about it and realized that Luo Zheng had purposely avoided her the day before. In any case, she was completely unaware of his whereabouts during that period of time. He indeed had plenty of time to do other things.</p>

  <p>Just as Freya was making wild guesses, she heard someone talk to her in her mind.</p>

  <p>"Some people are following us," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Even though the three people behind them had intentionally concealed their auras, how could they escape Zheng's senses? As soon as he had left the gathering place, Luo Zheng locked onto the movements of the three people.</p>

  <p>However, he had not been sure of their intentions earlier. After all, it was possible that the three of them were just going to mine. However, after Luo Zheng changed directions several times, he realized that they were still following him.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>At Zheng's words, Freya also noticed the three people following them.</p>

  <p>In fact, the three warriors didn't try to hide themselves. Riyad had asked them to make Luo Zheng "disappear" in the mine. In their eyes, a Life and Death Realm warrior and a Soul Sea Realm warrior were no match for them. They didn't need to hide themselves at all.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Freya was quite anxious. At the moment, she could only ask for Zheng's opinion.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk after we enter the mine," Luo Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>The two of them sped up as they headed toward the mine. The three people behind them also moved faster.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng randomly picked a cave and entered it along with Freya.</p>

  <p>The three people behind them snickered. One of them said, "No doubt this brat sensed our intentions. He still dares to enter the mine! It seems he is very confident of himself."</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing he is confident. But overconfidence often leads to one's death," another responded.</p>

  <p>"Leave the woman to me. There are few women here. It isn't easy to find one so beautiful. Don't kill her," the last person said with an evil grin.</p>

  <p>After this, the three of them shot into the cave at full speed.</p>

  <p>Just as the three of them entered, they found Luo Zheng standing alone, not so far from them. He held a long sword in his hand and said with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Hello."</p>

  <p>The look on the faces of the three didn't change. The leader looked at Luo Zheng and said coldly, "You know we want to kill you, but you're not running or hiding. You are bold enough."</p>

  <p>"You might be bold, but you don't have enough strength. In the end, you would die here without anyone knowing," another person added.</p>

  <p>"Did you come to kill me because of the bald warrior from yesterday?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. Riyad told us to kill you, so naturally you have to die," one of them replied.</p>

  <p>"Riyad?" Zheng's eyebrows rose slightly. "I've never provoked someone called Riyad."</p>

  <p>"You might have never provoked Riyad, but that's not important. What's important is that you have to die!" The three of them were very decisive in their actions and didn't waste any more time talking to Luo Zheng. As they finished speaking, they attacked him from all directions.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a gust of cold air swept over them. It was Freya's Snowfall Domain which spread out and enveloped the three of them.</p>

  <p>A proud smile materialized on Zheng's face. As he waved the sword in his hand elegantly, a strange arc flashed in the air. He sighed to himself.</p>

  <p>There was no real difference between the Upper World and the Lower World. This was also a world where the strong preyed on the weak.</p>

  <p>There was no reason or rhyme to it. Suddenly, a feeling of dullness arose in his heart. If the Upper World was the same as the Lower World, why did he try so hard to ascend to it initially?</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's mind was muddled, the sword radiance in his hand was sharp as ever.</p>

  <p>At the side of the gathering place, some warriors had used stones to build simple houses.</p>

  <p>A mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm had the power to move mountains and overturn seas. It was easy for them to cut some stones and construct houses.</p>

  <p>This was where Riyad lived.</p>

  <p>In truth, he had originally planned to build a palace. Back in the Lower World, he had been a peerless and formidable ruler. His divine kingdom had almost completely ruled over the great world that he resided in.</p>

  <p>He was used to a life of resources and women. After he had arrived in the Upper World, he found that they were few and far between.</p>

  <p>However, the palace was not completed yet. The armored men of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place did not approve of it, saying that if someone from the upper echelons were to see it, it would bring about huge problems.</p>

  <p>After all, this was a place for the warriors to mine. They were not here to enjoy life!</p>

  <p>Thus, Riyad had given up.</p>

  <p>He also knew that his own strength was nothing to speak of in the Upper World, but it didn't matter. He had accumulated tens of thousands of life vitality jades and that was already a massive amount of wealth. He used a portion of them to bribe the armored guards and kept the rest of them.</p>

  <p>These life vitality jades were enough to let him cultivate.</p>

  <p>Riyad looked forward to a better life in the Upper World. Unfortunately, he still needed to endure this current state. He knew he would have a good future, so he was patient right now. He would be able to leave this damned place if he endured for just a while longer.</p>

  <p>Even though he lived in a simple house, he still had access to pleasure.</p>

  <p>The three women in front of him tried to roll their hips enticingly in an attempt to seduce him.</p>

  <p>Females were rare to find here. Only a few warriors were able to enjoy these women. Riyad, of course, was one of them.</p>

  <p>The three women had been top warriors in the Lower World. Perhaps they were holy maidens, or perhaps they had been empresses of divine kingdoms. It was a pity that after ascending, they had to cling to and depend on these men to make their living.</p>

  <p>While the three women were performing an alluring dance, Riyad's complexion whitened. He crushed the metal wine cup in his hand into a ball.</p>

  <p>"The slave seals disappeared?" His expression turned grim.</p>

  <p>The slave seals he had planted on his own subordinates had completely vanished in an instant.</p>

  <p>It pointed to only one possibility� all three of them had been killed.</p>

  <p>They were Riyad's most capable men, and he was well aware of their strength. Moreover, the slave seals disappeared at almost the same time, which meant that someone had used a technique to kill the three of them in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Did the young Life and Death Realm warrior and the woman at the Soul Sea Realm do this?</p>

  <p>This was impossible!</p>

  <p>Almost subconsciously, Riyad dismissed the idea in his mind.</p>

  <p>It was most probable that the three of them were lured to the bottom of the mine by Luo Zheng, where they encountered powerful vicious beasts.</p>

  <p>However, his men were very careful. They would not allow Luo Zheng to enter the depths of the mine.</p>

  <p>"Riyad! What's the matter with you? You don't look too good!" A woman shook her slender waist and sat on his lap.</p>

  <p>Riyad snorted coldly. "Nothing. Something interesting happened."</p>
