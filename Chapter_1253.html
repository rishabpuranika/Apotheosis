<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Margaret busied herself in the kitchen in the Cloud Hall. The way she held the kitchen knife was kind of stiff, but her swift motions of chopping made the knife glow with the sharpness of cold silver light.</p>

  <p>Today was Yudie and Zheng's wedding day, and it seemed like she was absent-minded while doing the chore. The knife she was using was made out of heptyl gold and was extremely sharp. Since Margaret was spacing out, she failed to notice the deep cutting marks she created against the ironwood chopping board.</p>

  <p>The clamor of voices outside kept ringing in her ears and made her distracted.</p>

  <p>Margaret helplessly pursed her lips as she continued chopping swiftly, turning the vegetables on the chopping board into tiny pieces.</p>

  <p>"Caw, caw…"</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon let out a moan. Its tiny body curled up.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Ancestral Dragon had secretly eaten the dishes cooked by Margaret some time ago, it had almost forgotten about Zheng. This glutton had been staying with Margaret almost every day.</p>

  <p>Margaret was in a trance. Perhaps, she unknowingly focused her attention on the commotion outside, so she slowed down in her work.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon made the noise to remind her to hurry up.</p>

  <p>"Be patient. Wait for a while, and your meal will be ready," Margaret said with a smile. She was completely oblivious that she had already shredded the vegetables into a puree.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>Above the Cloud Hall, a speck of sparkling and translucent radiance rose into the air, turning into multicolored clouds that spread beautifully across the sky. Margaret could see the scene clearly. But she didn't stop what she was doing. The ironwood chopping board had already been broken into several parts by her!</p>

  <p>"Caw, caw…" the Ancestral Dragon whimpered again.</p>

  <p>"Wait for a minute..." There was still a faint smile on Margaret's face as she appeased the Ancestral Dragon. But that smile never changed. It was like a mask, looking extremely stiff.</p>

  <p>"Caw, caw…"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The kitchen knife in Margaret's hand was shoved firmly on the stove.</p>

  <p>Her soft body slightly trembled, and a powerful aura burst forth from her body. "Didn't I tell you to wait?"</p>

  <p>"Caw."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Margaret was about to go berserk, the Ancestral Dragon felt chills through its veins. It coiled up its small body immediately and buried its head in it.</p>

  <p>In the Martial Arts Hall, the grand wedding ceremony was carried out in an orderly manner. And as expected of martial artists' wedding ceremony, it was usually very solemn. The cost of money for any part of this rite would entail a considerable amount that would be more than enough for an ordinary family to live for several hundred years.</p>

  <p>However, there was not so much red tape involved in Yudie and Zheng's wedding ceremony.</p>

  <p>Amidst the blessings and congratulations, Zheng stood in the middle of the Martial Arts Hall, waiting for the arrival of the bride.</p>

  <p>Soon, his bride's whole entourage slowly approached him on a cloud.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze focused on Yudie who was wearing a red robe. She was surrounded by many servants who were dressed beautifully for such an occasion.</p>

  <p>Even if Yudie hadn't worn any makeup at all, she would still be incomparably elegant and beautiful. She was breathtakingly dolled up for her grand wedding. Every detail of her looks exuded perfectness. Even a single glance of her would make one's heart beat wildly!</p>

  <p>When Yudie descended from the cloud, the sound of gongs and drums reverberated through the hall. At this moment, everyone could watch the nine-colored auspicious clouds begin to dance in the air, together with a dragon and a phoenix projected on the enchanted barrier of Light of Water.</p>

  <p>In Cloudy City, many ordinary citizens looked up at the colorful Cloud Hall in the sky. Their faces filled with envy.</p>

  <p>"I heard that it's a grand wedding ceremony held by the immortals! What a grand scene!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, immortals? They are only a group of extremely powerful warriors with high-level cultivation."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a warrior too? When can you hold a grand wedding ceremony like that?"</p>

  <p>The news about the grand wedding ceremony quickly spread among the ordinary citizens, creating numerous rumors about it. The stories such as there were some peaches of immortality that had grown over ten thousand years, and nectar which could keep people from all diseases, and other sorts of strange legends went wild among the crowd of ordinary beings.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was making his way towards Yudie, people in the Central Region heard a laugh. The laughter seemed to come from the sky. But it suddenly spread out to the whole place, making everyone feel taken aback.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. He was clueless who had come. But today was his wedding day. If anything unpleasant happened, that would spoil his big day.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A figure shot down from the sky. It was an old man dressed in white clothes!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the old man directly went through the Light of Water. The extremely tough enchanted barrier did not cause any problem to him.</p>

  <p>If it was Zheng who tried to walk through the Light of Water, he would need to enter through the weak area at the bottom to pass through with no difficulty. However, this old man was able to penetrate the Light of Water with ease. Such theurgy he possessed amazed Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone raised their heads and looked over. Their eyes revealed shocked expressions as they carefully examined this old man.</p>

  <p>There was no way that they could tell the old man's strength!</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors present were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and a few independent warriors were at the Life and Death Realm. However, even the most powerful of them couldn't see through this old man's strength. So they assumed that his strength was beyond the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was clear that this person's strength was way beyond the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng was with the seven masters of the Celestial Position, he had gotten acquainted of what Spirit Supreme Realm masters were like from the aura around them. If someone's cultivation was a level higher than the Spirit Supreme Realm, he might be able to distinguish it. And it would be hard for him to estimate the person's strength if it was two levels above it. Nonetheless, his knowledge about the strength of warriors at or above the Spirit Supreme Realm was still in a grey area.</p>

  <p>Judging from his intuition, Zheng believed that this old man was indeed a warrior whose strength was beyond the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Most people in the crowd were nervous, especially the people from the World Commercial Alliance and the Ethereal Spirit Sect, fearing that some bad thing might happen. Although the bride of this grand wedding ceremony wasn't Margaret, in the end, Zheng was the man that she had to rely on for the rest of her life. Brent didn't look good at this time. He pursed his lips and seemed to be gloomy. He fully knew that his sister was not happy right now. So he selfishly hoped that this old man, who appeared out of nowhere, would disrupt the wedding ceremony so that Yudie would be upset.</p>

  <p>As for some others, such as those from Black Mountain Sect and the like who had once clashed with Zheng, they had no choice but to submit to the Cloud Hall. With the unknown tension in the air, they were eager to watch a good show. On the surface, they looked like they were paying tribute to Zheng, but deep inside, they all hoped that he would have some trouble.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng look uneasy, the old man roared into laughter. "Don't be nervous. Today is your wedding day. I come to attend your wedding ceremony. What? Am I not welcome?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng heaved a sigh of relief. The old man didn't seem to have borne an ill-intention. No matter who he was, Zheng could only greet him with a smile. He said in a clear voice, "Anyone who comes would be our guest. Since you are here to attend my wedding ceremony, I'm more than pleased to extend my warm welcome!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. Kid, you are a nice man. I like your straightforward manner," the old man said and laughed. "However, I have come here in a hurry and haven't brought any gift. That's not good," the old man added with a frown.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "Don't be bothered about the gift. It's only a way to express your blessings for us. We warriors don't care about those unimportant things. As long as all of you come here to celebrate our wedding day, I'm already very contented. Please be seated here and have fun!"</p>

  <p>The other guests also nodded their heads. The two maids beside them added a table to make him sit above the salt. Although these maids did not know how strong this old man was, from the reactions of the top masters in the Central Region, they knew the old man was not someone to be trifled with. Even though this old man looked quite messy, they all knew that he was akin to a powerful being, who was far beyond their wildest imagination. So he must have the seat of an honored guest.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the old man suddenly shook his head and said, "No!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed, confused. "Excuse me?"</p>

  <p>"A wedding ceremony is a great event in one's life, how can I not prepare a wedding gift?" The old man then shook his head fervently.</p>

  <p>A look of helplessness appeared on Zheng's face. He wanted to roll his eyes in his heart, but he still managed to look nice. Why did some old men become so difficult to deal with as they were getting on in years?</p>

  <p>Perhaps in the future, when he grew old, he would also behave like this, he wondered.</p>

  <p>However, before Zheng could say anything, a few of the more brave guests started to clamor.</p>

  <p>"Since you want to give them a wedding gift, then show it to us!"</p>

  <p>"You intentionally said so to keep all of us in suspense. You've already prepared the wedding gift, right?"</p>

  <p>"Then let everyone see what it is!"</p>

  <p>These guests who were speaking did not have a high level of cultivation and were only at the primary stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>However, it was Zheng's wedding day, so they assumed that no matter how strong this old man was, he wouldn't make things look ugly in such an occasion.</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled and nodded. "Ha-ha, how do you know that I've already had a gift for them?" With that, the old man's body instantly flashed, and he appeared right in front of Zheng, who didn't even have time to react.</p>

  <p>After that, he faced Zheng with his eyes wide open. Then everyone saw Zheng close his eyes and quickly fall to the ground!</p>
