<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Herbert was the most gentle among the six Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>However, he had chosen the Purge Way because, on behalf of the Element Spirit race, the Yellow Thearch had promised him that the chaos would exist forever.</p>

  <p>Herbert didn't care much for his own life, but the Yellow Thearch's words piqued his interest.</p>

  <p>In the previous round of chaos, most of his clansmen had perished when the Finale Way was being executed. Even his one true love didn't make it out alive. This was one of the main reasons why he wasn't swayed by Fuxi.</p>

  <p>In Herbert's eyes, Fuxi indeed had a great talent, but there was almost no possibility of him completing the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>"When the end comes, we won't stand a chance," said Othniel gravely.</p>

  <p>Once the chaos reached a certain extent, the needle would emerge.</p>

  <p>The people who advocated the Purge Way now needed to eliminate anyone who was obsessed with the Finale Way, and then lastly, they needed to exterminate all the other creatures in the Source World.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they had already started the process of extermination.</p>

  <p>Previously, Othniel played a big role in killing creatures in three hundred provinces.</p>

  <p>"Well, what're we waiting for?" Herbert was already fully aware of the situation at hand, and had resigned himself to his fate. Thus, he saw no need to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Othniel nodded. Just then, a human flew towards them from the ground.</p>

  <p>He was a native of the Taoism Province. He had once been to the Pear Hill for further study, and now his cultivation base was at the ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Facing the huge figures before him, he surprisingly felt calm. Mustering up all his strength, he shouted at the two Chaos Ancient Gods, "Great Chaos Ancient Gods! The chaos created you for the completion of the Finale Way, not the other way around!"</p>

  <p>Most of the people who had acknowledged the Finale Way believed that the Chaos Ancient Gods should unite together.</p>

  <p>But in the end, things went awry. There was a great divide among the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Othniel looked at the tiny human expressionlessly. A ray of light suddenly flashed in his huge eye, and the human found that he couldn't move, frozen in the air.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the miniscule human shattered into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>Every fragment floated aimlessly in the space.</p>

  <p>Herbert frowned at his fellow Chaos Ancient God. As he pointed at the fragments, an invisible cage enveloped what once was the tiny human from the Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>When the cage shrank, it skillfully pieced all the fragments together, restoring the human's original shape.</p>

  <p>His body was flawless and brought back to normal, but he had lost all his vitality in the process.</p>

  <p>"I don't like too much chaos," Herbert commented under his breath.</p>

  <p>Othniel sneered disdainfully, "Restoring him consumes more energy, which leads to more chaos."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a wave of incredibly powerful energy surged out of Othniel's body.</p>

  <p>The wave rippled all over the Taoism Province, shaking the very core of the earth beneath it.</p>

  <p>Every building, mountain, river, and creature disintegrated into mounds of dust under the force of the vibration.</p>

  <p>Very few warriors at the Other Shore Realm survived, but they were seriously injured.</p>

  <p>Othniel knew these creatures would be killed sooner or later. He had just sped up the process. He felt absolutely no pity for them.</p>

  <p>Herbert shook his head when he saw what Othniel had done. Stretching out his slender fingers, he gently waved his hands in the air.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>Blue pillars rose from the cracked earth, one after another, forming a circle around the Pear Hill. These blue pillars continued to rise until they pierced the very skies.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill was a prison now. Everything within it was doomed.</p>

  <p>From the other end of the province, the people of the Black Ship could see the pillars rising.</p>

  <p>"Herbert has made his move," the captain of the Black Ship said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes were also fixed on the rising blue pillars.</p>

  <p>"Now that the Pear Hill is being besieged, let's see how they will deal with it."</p>

  <p>He was always very calm.</p>

  <p>Although the Chaos Ancient Gods were difficult to deal with, he knew what he needed to do.</p>

  <p>The six truth-level theurgies had been thoroughly studied. For people like the Grandmaster of Heaven, he was more afraid of the unknown than this.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng, despite looking like the weakest one of the lot, made him anxious.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had been able to control his Fishing Drum. Even now, the Grandmaster of Heaven was still confused as to how he did it.</p>

  <p>He clenched his fists as he thought resolutely, 'I need to capture him.'</p>

  <p>The moment the first blue pillar emerged from the earth, a huge vibration was transmitted into the Pear Hill, and the hill sounded the alarm.</p>

  <p>All the mountain leaders and sect leaders ordered their people to return to their positions.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had already briefed them on what was to come when she summoned them.</p>

  <p>This was a life and death battle among top masters. Those at the Holy Soul Realm were not qualified to join.</p>

  <p>But together, they could form one, massive being using the Cloud Cover Array.</p>

  <p>It was only through this that the Pear Hill would stand a chance against the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>At the top of the Pear Hill, a golden magic array floated in the air. Yan stood at the very center of it.</p>

  <p>From afar, the complex golden magic array resembled a long, flowing dress that shone brightly, covering her snake tail.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The golden array suddenly began to glow.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Yan activated the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>"Let's begin," she said, her voice trembling slightly. There was a trace of nervousness in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She hadn't spoken very loudly, but as the words left her lips, they traveled with ease towards the bottom of the hill.</p>

  <p>"Begin..."</p>

  <p>"Begin..."</p>

  <p>"Begin..."</p>

  <p>Her voice echoed in the ears of every disciple of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill took up almost the whole province.</p>

  <p>The people were arranged according to rank in strength. The ones closer to the top were the strongest, and conversely, those at the foot of the hill were slightly lower in rank.</p>

  <p>Of course, the grand leaders of mountains and sects were positioned near the top of the Pear Hill, whereas ordinary sect leaders and disciples were located on the mountainside.</p>

  <p>The cities built by province citizens and mortals were mostly at the foot of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yan's voice, the disciples sat cross-legged and channeled their strength into the golden arrays before them.</p>

  <p>Each small golden magic array was a branch. The branches converged into the nine arteries, and the power of the nine arteries finally converged into Yan's "golden dress".</p>

  <p>As the energy surged along the golden magic arrays, the white clouds that shrouded the Pear Hill rumbled with activity.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The power contained in the "golden dress" became terrifyingly strong. After a few moments, it had collected all the complex energy of the disciples of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to harness this much energy without the help of the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>Seeing how everyone was doing their part and sending energy her way, Yan gently touched the magic array with her fingers. The second her fingers connected with the magic array, the energy burst upwards and shot towards the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>With the guidance of the Calculation Civilization, her Energy Shaft had been greatly improved in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>However, the Calculation Civilization had also told her that this was still not the complete version of the Energy Shaft. If the expected Energy Shaft was actualized, wars would be completely eradicated. Such an Energy Shaft would bring infinite power and infinite strength.</p>

  <p>Raising her right hand resolutely, Yan pointed towards the blue pillars in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Go!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Obediently, the Energy Shaft above her head shot out a pale golden light, which rushed towards the blue pillars.</p>
