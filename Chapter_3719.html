<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To reach the Colorless Soul was still a hard task for a Soul of Light who had reached the twenty-eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>However, if given enough time, they still might be able to do it.</p>

  <p>Still, it usually took a huge deal of effort to obtain the Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>After all, every second inside the light column was no better than swimming in hot magma.</p>

  <p>It had already been a matter of life and death for Dailey to just hold on until the first imprint appeared. However, it seemed so easy for Luo Zheng to obtain those imprints! Of course, he found it hard to accept this.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only Dailey who felt depressed, everyone present couldn't keep calm as well.</p>

  <p>For instance, Zhu Ge Feng had previously encouraged Luo Zheng in hopes of teaching him a lesson, but he never thought that Luo Zheng could cross the soul cloud and enter the light column above.</p>

  <p>"Blazing Fire Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Myriad Lives Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Lifeless Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Myriad Ghosts Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Myriad Ways Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"No Three Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Earth Moving Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Returning Sky Imprint!"</p>

  <p>The first eight Holy Soul Imprints hit the surface of Luo Zheng's soul one by one.</p>

  <p>There was one on his chest, one on his elixir field, two on his shoulders, one on his forehead, and two on his waist.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had obtained eight Holy Soul Imprints, the rising soul pillar under his feet suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Still confused, Luo Zheng asked, "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know either," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had a deep understanding of the Other Shore, and perhaps there were few people who knew some things he didn't.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's problem now was truly beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>He repeatedly tried to figure out what was wrong during the whole process.</p>

  <p>He also knew Luo Zheng's origins quite well. After all, he had also created the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree, and the only variable in Luo Zheng's growth was probably his special physical body and the Primal Chaos Technique. But even so, those two shouldn't have much to do with the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't figure out what the problem was, Luo Zheng didn't bother to think about it.</p>

  <p>In any case, the soul pillar didn't rise or fall, so he looked around to observe the surrounding environment instead.</p>

  <p>From his point of view, he could see the whole Soul City.</p>

  <p>There was a circular area within the city, and the soul pillars were equally distributed inside it. A group of greyish-brown buildings that were only made of souls were located far away from the soul pillars.</p>

  <p>The buildings and houses in the Soul City were all inaccessible. Some Souls of Light had managed to enter, but they never came out of them. It was said that they had turned into a part of the Soul City, and since then, no one ever dared to explore those houses anymore.</p>

  <p>Now, the Souls of Light just came to the city and reached the Holy Soul Realm, then left in a hurry.</p>

  <p>However, that cabin on top of the Soul City still caught the attention of many Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>This cabin had a spire and a small window on one side. Every time the gates of the Soul City opened, a faint yellow candle light shone through the window.</p>

  <p>Because the candlelight always lit up once the city's gates opened, many Souls of Light believed that there must be creatures that lived inside that cabin.</p>

  <p>However, no one had ever set foot in that cabin.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit race, which dominated the Other Shore for the longest time, had never been inside it!</p>

  <p>In fact, the cabin was so mysterious that the Element Spirit race had tried to go in during the second and third chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>To see what was inside, the Element Spirit race had once invited the "Ghost Head" from Stage Thirty-three to come down. That was the strongest Other Shore creature the Element Spirit race had invited.</p>

  <p>After the Ghost Head had entered the cabin, it completely disappeared ever since.</p>

  <p>At that time, the soul cloud had also devoured all the Souls of Light in the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Since then, the Element Spirit race never tried to go inside that cabin again.</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed since Luo Zheng's soul pillar stayed. Then, the light became brighter, and all the golden lights seemed to gather and form an entity.</p>

  <p>When viewed from afar, the light pillar continued to condense and almost turned into a solid golden column that tightly enclosed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Soul City and faces in the soul cloud originally made various kinds of sounds.</p>

  <p>But after the golden column appeared, the whole Soul City immediately became quiet.</p>

  <p>The song that rang continuously also stopped.</p>

  <p>Everything was silent but it felt uneasy, so all the Souls of Light that were present became vigilant.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Souls of Light who were still in the soul cloud chose to give up and jumped down from the soul pillars. Then, they looked at the scene above in shock.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The soul pillar under Luo Zheng's feet trembled and began to rise slowly again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who remained nonchalant the whole time, finally began to feel a lot of pain.</p>

  <p>When the golden column was fully formed, it thoroughly wrapped Luo Zheng within.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng couldn't move or see anything. It seemed that he had become a part of the golden column.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw that Luo Zheng was about to ask something, he immediately uttered, "Stop asking. Let's wait and see!"</p>

  <p>Although the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what that was, he was actually quite excited. He realized that Luo Zheng had a chance to ascend to the top. Even though everything came so suddenly and was even hard to understand, things seemed to go in a way he had expected.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before a number of 1, 720 feet appeared on Luo Zheng's soul pillar.</p>

  <p>At that point, the solid golden column that wrapped Luo Zheng suddenly collapsed, and the material of the column repeatedly shattered, peeled off, and fell into the soul cloud from above.</p>

  <p>When those "faces" saw the broken pieces fall, they swarmed towards them like a school of fish in the pond and desperately scrambled for those fragments.</p>

  <p>While the golden column continued to peel off, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light slowly appeared, then the ninth Holy Soul Imprint fell on his head.</p>

  <p>"Power Guide Imprint!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood on the surface of the soul pillar, straightened his waist, and breathed slightly.</p>

  <p>The nine Holy Soul Imprints in his soul outlined golden meridians that were distributed the same way as his body's meridians.</p>

  <p>As he exhaled, the golden meridians turned from light to dark, then from dark to light.</p>

  <p>Even though his soul had reached the Holy Soul Realm and had almost the same strength as his physical body, it was still a soul.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, his soul underwent a qualitative change.</p>

  <p>The nine Holy Soul Imprints formed a large circulation, and made his soul a different life!</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Luo Zheng asked when he saw a small copper ring float in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at the copper ring with interest.</p>

  <p>He had seen it before when he obtained the seventh imprint.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his hand and gently pulled the copper ring, which caused the entire Soul City to shake.</p>

  <p>A huge gear wheel on the right side of the Soul City rolled slowly and continuously released the chain made of souls.</p>

  <p>A chain bridge, which was originally hidden inside the wall, descended slowly and extended towards Luo Zheng. The bridge led to that cabin with a spire!</p>
