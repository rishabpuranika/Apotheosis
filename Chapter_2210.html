<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2210 Mae Han </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even Master Evil hadn't said anything, Luo Luo Zheng was already very well aware that Yazid wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>The problem was that he didn't have the ability to fight against Yazid. All he could do now was pin his last hopes on the Han Clan sub-branches!</p>

  <p>He bet that the people from the Han Clan sub-branches would help him.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he truly hoped they wouldn't just watch him die at Yazid's mercy.</p>

  <p>Throughout his time there, Luo Luo Zheng had rarely faced such danger in the Evolutionary Universe. Back then, never would he place his hopes on anyone else but himself, because he knew very well that if he ever placed his hopes on the wrong person, the only result would be his death!</p>

  <p>Here and now though, he was in the divine land. And Luo Luo Zheng, who was a secondary creature and a total stranger in this place, had no choice but to take a few risks.</p>

  <p>As the power of the five elements surged upward, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly heard a loud collision, followed by a muffled groan...</p>

  <p>The illusion around him completely disappeared at once.</p>

  <p>A smile of relief simultaneously spread on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Bentley was clenching his fists and he looked to be boiling with anger. As Yazid placed his hands on his chest and fell into the corner of a wall, he continued coughing loudly, and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>And yet, no one had even seen how Bentley had done it. He was way too fast.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack me, Bentley?" Yazid spat resentfully.</p>

  <p>Bentley sneered back coldly. "There's nothing I wouldn't dare do! We might be just about the same age, but I am the leader of the Han Clan sub-branches, after all. Let that be heard! Speaking of which, you're only a liaison from the Floating Island. Do you really think I can't hurt you?</p>

  <p>Even if I killed you, the main Han Clan wouldn't punish me in the least!"</p>

  <p>"You!" Yazid felt both scared and angry at the same time.</p>

  <p>Yazid might be a member of the main Han Clan, and equally a top-rank True God, but he wasn't valued by the main Han Clan whatsoever. His mediocre talent and average strength didn't impress them at all.</p>

  <p>The liaison he served as was actually a position with little responsibilities, but because of his seniority and his cultivation level, everyone respected him. In fact, his status was even far inferior to that of Bentley.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Bentley had an eccentric character and often found himself laughing and joking with the disciples of younger generation. As the leader of the Han Clan sub-branches, he was actually highly valued by the main Han Clan. Over the years, the main Han Clan even wanted to transfer Bentley to the Floating Island in order for him to serve through a meaningful position, but Bentley refused them time and time again.</p>

  <p>If he did kill Yazid, the main Han Clan would certainly hold him responsible, but the punishment wouldn't be too severe and not to mention that Bentley was reasonable on this matter. After all, it just didn't make any sense that it was just because a talent recommended by the Heavenly Han House understood Yazid's Five Elements Destructing technique that Yazid wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood in the center of the main hall without saying a word. The old man had almost killed him, and thus, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have a very good impression of him.</p>

  <p>As for the other leaders of the Han Clan sub-branches, generally speaking, they would scheme against each other, trying to fight for the benefits of their own sub-branch. This time though, they were pleased to see that Bentley had taught Yazid a lesson!</p>

  <p>"That man... I refuse to bring him into the Floating Island! There's just no way!" Yazid said hatefully. "Next year, when the Han Clan sends people here, I'll go with them. As long as I'm still here, there's just no way that he's going to the Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Bentley only shrugged his shoulders and said,</p>

  <p>"Whatever!" With that, he turned his head to look at Tianxing and said, "For such a talent, many places will want to welcome him. Aside from the Han Clan, there's the Jiang Clan, Mu Clan, Li Clan... Just to name a few.</p>

  <p>Actually, take a second and think here... Which one of them wouldn't want him to join? If you insist on causing delay in fulfilling the Han Clan's mission, then do whatever you want! But when Tianxing becomes famous in the near future, I'll go straight to the main Han Clan in order to humiliate you directly!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only smile back at Bentley's words.</p>

  <p>The other people in the main hall agreed with him, too. In their opinion, Luo Zheng's performance was no just enough to be described as amazing. He could see through and even comprehend an original Divine Dao token in less than five minutes. His talent was outrageous.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter anymore whether or not people knew his background, all the wealthy clans would want to have him on their side and benefit from his talent.</p>

  <p>Bentley also had the intention of drawing Luo Luo Zheng over to his side with what he had said. He knew that Luo Luo Zheng was much more than just an ordinary talent. When it came to such a character, he would either kill him straight away, or form a good relationship with him. It was a make or break type of situation. As the leader of the Han Clan sub-branches, Bentley was a wise man and he knew what he had to do.</p>

  <p>After a long, silent pause, Yazid stared at Bentley and snorted. "Just wait and see!" he exclaimed finally.</p>

  <p>And with that, he floated into the air with the intention of leaving the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>But before he could get anywhere, a purple shadow suddenly floated down from the sky. It was enormous and somewhat resembled a huge flower.</p>

  <p>The glowing rays emitting from the flower were absolutely dazzling.</p>

  <p>The purple flower came to halt when it reached the top-center of the Heavenly Han House. One of the flower's petals gently drooped open and a woman floated down from it.</p>

  <p>She was in a magenta gauzy robe, and the corners of her elegant clothes flustered in the windy sky. Her descent made her look dynamic and charming.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for the woman to land and for a short while, the woman stood steadily in the main hall. She looked up at Yazid who hovered in the air with a gentle smile on her face. Then, she fixed her eyes on Bentley and said, "We are all from the same clan. Why did you fight one another?"</p>

  <p>"Mae! Ah, you're here!" Bentley didn't answer her question, but calmly cupped his hands toward her.</p>

  <p>"What?" Mae Han asked, as she smiled faintly. "Am I not welcome here?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! To the contrary, we feel honored to have you here, Miss,"</p>

  <p>Bentley said, a smile pursed on his lips.</p>

  <p>To be brutally honest, deep inside himself, he didn't want Mae Han to be here at all. The reason for the latter was because she was a disciple of the Demi-Holy Being, Joy.</p>

  <p>In the test in the Heavenly Han House, Luo Luo Zheng had displayed his amazing talent. During the test, he had been acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao. The warriors from the Han Clan's sixth sub-branch had quietly sent someone to the Floating Island in order to inform Joy of such news.</p>

  <p>Bentley wanted to be the first one to recommend Luo Luo Zheng to the Floating Island, and thus, he invited Yazid to come here.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected to fight with Yazid, and Joy had actually acted so quickly. Before Yazid could even leave, Mae Han had arrived.</p>

  <p>In the past, he hadn't had any desire for Luo Luo Zheng to be taken away by Joy. In that case, the Han Clan sub-branches wouldn't get the credit for recommending an eligible candidate.</p>

  <p>Now though, with such a big conflict between him and Yazid, it was nearly impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to be sent to the Floating Island through traditional means. There was no wondering why he thought he should take advantage of the situation and do Joy a favor.</p>

  <p>After pondering it over for a little while, his lips spread into a tight, wide smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm here for a little fellow known as Tianxing. My master, Joy, has heard about him and wants to take him to the Floating Island," Mae Han requested directly, without wasting anytime. She had already cast her beautiful eyes on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The people in the main hall were all the leaders of Han Clan sub-branches. They were almost all mid-rank True Gods, and only Luo Luo Zheng was a proving godly warrior. Since Yazid was also here, it was easy for her to come to the conclusion that the young man standing before her was rightly Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Yazid had clearly stated just seconds before that Luo Luo Zheng would have no chance of ever entering the Floating Island, but now, Joy had sent someone here to take Luo Luo Zheng directly to the Floating Island instead. The whole thing was rather ironic.</p>

  <p>In order to impress Mae Han, Bentley smiled and spoke up, "Joy has an eye for talent. This person is indeed a rare talent. One couldn't have found such a talent among the children of the Han Clan on the Floating Island if they had wanted to!"</p>

  <p>To Mae Han though, Bentley's words didn't make any sense.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House was always cautious when around Joy. But why was Bentley being so cooperative today? What was wrong with him?</p>

  <p>Malloy equally bowed his head in agreement and sighed softly. He knew his only choice now was to hand Tianxing over to her.</p>

  <p>Yazid, who had planned to leave, was unable to accept such a result. He suddenly said, "Joy only recruits warriors that cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao. And yet this guy doesn't have a Purple Power Body. How did he attract Joy's attention, then? This is just ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>Yazid knew that Luo Luo Zheng had been recognized by hundreds of Divine Dao Tablets, but he didn't know that among them was a Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao Tablet. Never in the past had he heard something so strange. A warrior without a Purple Power Body simply couldn't cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>Bentley laughed. "Tianxing, show a few of your abilities to some of these people who seem to come from a hole in the ground."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng responded very quickly. As soon as Bentley finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng gently waved his hand, and a wisp of purple mist shot up into the sky!</p>

  <p>The purple mist turned into a phoenix and circled above the sky over the Heavenly Han House, before obediently landing directly on Luo Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>'He can turn purple mist into substance! And he is doing so with such skill. But he hasn't condensed a Godly Tile yet. What a strange guy!'</p>

  <p>Mae thought as she sized Luo Luo Zheng up with a strange look in her eye. Luo Luo Zheng didn't have the Purple Power Body, but he could certainly cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao. This was simply incredible.</p>

  <p>And with what she had just witnessed, it was even harder for her to believe that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't condensed a Godly Tile despite having mastered the technique of turning purple mist into substance.</p>
