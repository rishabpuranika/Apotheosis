<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Warriors of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, I can't wait to see your performances!" Scott cheered exuberantly.</p>

  <p>As the emperor of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, he led the warriors behind him to stand on the highest platform.</p>

  <p>Among those following him were warriors at both the Life and Death and Virtual Tribulation Realms. In all likelihood, they were the princes and princesses of the Star Field Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>After Scott had arrived, a bright blue stream of light appeared from not too far away. It went down like a comet, dragging a long trail as it emerged.</p>

  <p>When the light approached closer, Luo Zheng discovered that it was a grand sword that had been magnified countless times.</p>

  <p>"The emperor of the York Divine Kingdom has arrived!"</p>

  <p>Some people were able to identify the great sword's origin.</p>

  <p>As expected, when the huge sword stopped at the riverbank, some powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm showed up, followed by hundreds more.</p>

  <p>The same sharp voice announced again, "War Emperor York of the York Divine Kingdom has arrived!"</p>

  <p>Compared to Scott of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, War Emperor York's personality was a bit more dismal. He flew through the square without a word and brought his men directly to the platform.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng took a closer look, he saw a woman with a veil covering her face right behind War Emperor York. His eyebrows twitched slightly, and he shrunk back into the crowd.</p>

  <p>That woman was none other than the Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng had no idea about the current standing of the Holy Maiden in their divine kingdom. If she happened to recognize him, was it possible that the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm of the York Divine Kingdom could come after him?</p>

  <p>Both Scott and War Emperor York were at the Soul Sea Realm. There was a gap in terms of strength among warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, it was impossible for him to escape those two emperors.</p>

  <p>If the Holy Maiden saw him, was War Emperor York to attack him too?</p>

  <p>All the thoughts that were running in his head began to make him feel anxious. Quickly, he took a deep breath and tried his best to calm down.</p>

  <p>He believed in his luck. He had been through so much, so he knew he was also going to survive more obstacles that came his way.</p>

  <p>The emperors of the Wind and Harlen Divine Kingdoms all arrived.</p>

  <p>They were War King Wind and Turner Zhou respectively.</p>

  <p>The titles of the four emperors were indeed confusing. It wasn't strange for other warriors, but Luo Zheng thought it was quite strange.</p>

  <p>When warriors reached the Soul Sea Realm, they had the chance to be kings and emperors. Some of them kept their names while the others chose to name themselves War King or War Emperor.</p>

  <p>The crown prince followed on a wheelchair. Lord Randy was also among the warriors standing behind Turner Zhou.</p>

  <p>On the platform were many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm as well as the imperial members of the four divine kingdoms. On the square below were the elites of the younger generation of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>When almost everyone was already in the area, that same voice rang out once again.</p>

  <p>"Everyone from the four divine kingdoms is already here. According to the customs, a competition will be held first, and then we will offer sacrifices to the great ancestors."</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the entrance of the Feather Holy Sea at that time, Luo Zheng also understood how the four divine kingdoms explored that place every year.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms looked at the Feather Holy Sea like it was a giant cake. Every year, each divine kingdom divided the cake. Whoever got the first slice or the bigger one could be decided through certain methods.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of years ago, the four emperors relied on arguments to the point of physical duels in order to come up with a decision.</p>

  <p>The fights that went down among those war kings and war emperors were groundbreaking. Because the four divine kingdoms had the same origins, they wanted to have a harmonious relationship with each other as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Thus, before offering sacrifices to the ancestors, the top warriors of the younger generation of the four divine kingdoms had to fight against each other first. That way, they could examine the strength of the young warriors and finally decide.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the four divine kingdoms considered those battles of the utmost importance. There were warriors who even discussed predictions of the outcome as well as the strength of the participants.</p>

  <p>The four emperors were standing on the highest platform. Scott laughed at the situation that unfolded before him. Everyone around him was so pumped. Then, he announced, "Warriors of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, please come forth!"</p>

  <p>As there were three sixth-grade martial houses in the Star Field Divine Kingdom, six warriors could be ranked in the first tier. When Scott had finished speaking, a warrior rushed out of the square in a flash towards the bottom of the platform to take a bow. "Your Majesty, I, Titus Zhao, am representing the Wisteria Martial House."</p>

  <p>Being the emperor of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, Scott naturally had a good knowledge of the young warriors of theirs. He seemed to be quite confident of Titus Zhao. Smiling proudly, he said, "Good! Today, you shall fight.</p>

  <p>Now, who wants to challenge this young man?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Scott finished speaking, a beam of light flashed. It was another warrior who charged his way to the foot of the platform. He was from the York Divine Kingdom and looked rather well-built and was quite tall.</p>

  <p>"I, Logan Yun from Shadow Martial House of York Divine Kingdom, would like to challenge you."</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on War Emperor York's face. Finally, one of theirs appeared. "Logan, you are said to be invincible among the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. I believe you won't let me down this time," he encouraged.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid my invincibility is only just a rumor, Your Majesty," Logan Yun humbly replied. Despite such a statement, it was evident that his confidence was strong, almost as if he didn't care that much about the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm that were present on the square.</p>
