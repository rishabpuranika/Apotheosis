<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2241 Hug </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The three siblings of the Han Clan were now famous in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Pascal, Han Liusu, and Aleyna, the youngest children of the Holy Emperor were all outstanding in the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Among them, Aleyna was ranked second among the proving godly warriors while Han Liusu was ranked third among the low-rank True Gods. As for Pascal, he was ranked first among the mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>There were thirty-six Floating Islands on the Time Sea, meaning the existence of thirty-six wealthy clans. The talents of each clan were not to be underestimated? among them, some were lineal descendants, some were geniuses from the sub-branches of the main clans, and some were outstanding disciples of other clans...</p>

  <p>But the three siblings of the Han Clan occupied the top positions respectively, creating quite the miracle. Someone even announced that the Han Clan was about to rise again, likely to break into the top three among the big clans in the future.</p>

  <p>Soon after Han Liusu came back from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she had condensed her own Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>But it was a very special Godly Tile?</p>

  <p>Her inner world was completely different from that of others.</p>

  <p>Before condensing her own Godly Tile, all Han Liusu knew was that when her body emitted deadly blue preternatural flames, it was completely out of her control. The flame had even hurt her family, distressing her greatly.</p>

  <p>Not even the Holy Emperor knew what the flame was, nor could he help his daughter get rid of it.</p>

  <p>When Han Liusu condensed her Godly Tile, her inner world underwent a dramatic change.</p>

  <p>At that time, countless blue preternatural flames spurted from her inner world she had created and preserved. They burned her entire inner world to ash, destroying all its living beings along with it.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely painful process? as a girl, it pained Han Liusu to witness the numerous creatures that she had created burn down to nothing.</p>

  <p>When the flames descended upon her inner world, huge clouds of blue flames appeared in the sky. It was these clouds that condensed her Godly Tile, allowing her to become a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Countless creatures came into existence in her inner world at the same time.</p>

  <p>These creatures were not human beings, nor were they created according to Liusu's own will? they were all monsters born in the sea of flames and they had no problem living in these blue flames. They began reproducing and becoming the 'aboriginals' of her inner world.</p>

  <p>The Godly Tile condensed by a proving godly warrior was usually for one of three thousand Divine Dao. For instance, if one cultivated the Five Elements Divine Dao, the internal momentum of the Five Elements Divine Dao would condense into the Five Elements Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>But Liusu's Godly Tile was an abnormal one.</p>

  <p>The divine land was vast and boundless, home to countless divine citizens. And indeed, there was a small portion of proving godly warriors that condensed some strange and unique Godly Tiles? they did not belong to any of the three thousand Divine Dao, but the vast majority of them were useless. Such were called useless Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>It happened so that although most of the abnormal Godly Tiles were useless, some of them had incomparable power.</p>

  <p>And Liusu's Godly Tile belonged to the latter.</p>

  <p>By taking advantage of the blue preternatural flames, she quickly accumulated points in the Arena of Legends, quickly climbing up to the third rank.</p>

  <p>She was the only female warrior among the top ten low-rank True Gods and she had amazed all the people on the thirty-six Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Leng Clan was willing to unite with the Han Clan by marriage because of Liusu's special abilities.</p>

  <p>The blue flames on her body were much purer and stronger than they were when she was in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Even though Han Liusu was no match for Langston, he was still afraid of her preternatural flames.</p>

  <p>In spite of that, it was still easy for Langston to defeat Han Liusu with his strength. But Han Liusu was the woman he liked, and the news that they would get married had spread far and wide across the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Now, this woman was going to go against him, all for another man.</p>

  <p>How could the arrogant Langston endure such a thing?</p>

  <p>The corners of his eyes twitched. His eyes glinted with a strong intent to murder as he stared at Han Liusu and asked, "How could you do this to me for an outsider? a nobody from grassroots? You're my fiancee!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Langston's exclamation, the warriors in the hall exchanged looks of surprise. Why did he suddenly lose his temper, they wondered.</p>

  <p>Flames flickered on the tips of Liusu's hair as mockery filled her beautiful eyes. "You're Langston, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say?" Langston asked.</p>

  <p>"We've met only a few times. Although my father has arranged the engagement for me, he's never asked for my consent. We're not even friends. How dare you say that I'm your fiancee? If I'm forced to marry you someday, I will end my life before the marriage. Do you understand?" Han Liusu was calm as she said it, and it seemed that she felt what she did was justified.</p>

  <p>That made Langston's eyes twitch more violently.</p>

  <p>No man could bear such an insult, and he was known to be an excellent one.</p>

  <p>Liusu's words enraged him. His handsome face radiated a murderous Mu Ning, like a storm formed by countless demons raging in the hall.</p>

  <p>Whoever felt the killing intent began to panic, and the few top-rank True Gods were no exception.</p>

  <p>Taking slow steps, Grant calmly said, "Everyone, although we are guarding our own clans, there are some things I must make clear. If this guy intends to hurt our princess, I will definitely kill him! If you try to stop me, be ready to face the anger of the Han Clan."</p>

  <p>The young warriors were running amok. Grant knew he should abide by the rules and avoid getting involved? he couldn't stop them either.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't sit idly by if the lives of the Han Clan's core disciples were threatened as well.</p>

  <p>The few top-rank True Gods also realized the seriousness of the matter.</p>

  <p>If the young master of the Leng Clan really killed the Han Clan princess, they would be held responsible. They also wanted to take control of the situation.</p>

  <p>But Langston didn't take any action? he was also trying his best to restrain himself. To these guards of the wealthy clans, they would try their best to keep themselves out of the fights between the wealthy clan descendants.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>After the killing intent lingered for a long while, Langston suddenly began laughing wildly.</p>

  <p>After he stopped laughing, he looked down at Han Liusu and said indifferently, "Don't forget who I am. I will never be stuck with one woman. Let me tell you, it is an established fact that the Leng Clan and the Han Clan will unite by marriage. You can die if you don't want to marry me. But after you die, I will marry your sister! If your sister dies too, I will marry your cousin?"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Aleyna and Kelsey looked at each other in worry.</p>

  <p>Liusu's eyes flashed? Langston wasn't someone who would easily give in. If she meant what she said, Langston was also sure to act on his words.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to talk about this with you today," Langston continued.</p>

  <p>"But the man behind you must die!"</p>

  <p>"You can have a try." Han Liusu was ready to go all out. Luo Luo Zheng was standing up for Aleyna and she wouldn't let him die for this.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't move as his blood continued gushing out. He leaned against the door to the hall and stared at Liusu's back, the flickering flames on her hair sending him into deep thought.</p>

  <p>Did she already know who he was?</p>

  <p>Even if it was Tianxing who got into trouble because of helping Aleyna, Han Liusu wouldn't have been so determined to protect him.</p>

  <p>As he was gathering his thoughts, Luo Luo Zheng felt a figure flicker nearby. As a gust of wind blew, his heart sank. If Langston really acted to kill him, Han Liusu wouldn't be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>Seeing Langston pounce on Luo Luo Zheng from the sky, Han Liusu dashed towards Luo Luo Zheng and hugged him tightly at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>Blazing blue preternatural flames swept out and covered the area.</p>

  <p>Even Langston was afraid of Liusu's preternatural flames, his body twisted and landed several feet away. He could only stare coldly into the flames. It seemed that Liusu's preternatural flames could burn everything. And if so, wouldn't that brat also be burned to death at that rate?</p>
