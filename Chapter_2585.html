  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a satisfied smirk on Lisa's face as she leisurely waved the black sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Wild Gods used crude and violent killing methods because they judged the distance and space in a complicated way.</p>

  <p>In addition, it was much more difficult for a giant to slip the thread through the eye of the needle than an ordinary man.</p>

  <p>Lisa, however, could control those things with absolute accuracy--and it was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Her moves were always careful, precise, and perfect.</p>

  <p>She could have killed Romeo several times, but her thin, black sword only scratched him slightly and left a minor wound.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the wounds on Romeo's body increased until blood had soaked most of his white clothes.</p>

  <p>"You've already been defeated. Don't struggle anymore," said Lisa with pursed lips.</p>

  <p>Yet, Romeo didn't listen to her and launched an even fiercer attack.</p>

  <p>In turn, Lisa gently drew her black sword. The tips of her toes barely touched the ground as she drew a huge pit that was over a hundred feet large. Then, she jumped up while Romeo slashed out with his sword.</p>

  <p>The black sword flew down like a giant flying snake.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The sword's blade pierced through Romeo's arm.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the bamboo sword flew and was nailed to the ground. Without the support of the Wild God Power, the thousand-foot-long bamboo sword quickly shrunk back into three feet.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Lisa swung her sword towards Romeo's head. If she exerted more strength, he would be beheaded!</p>

  <p>All the spectators from the Nine Li race held their breaths.</p>

  <p>They had already lost Monty, and they wouldn't be able to accept it if Romeo died too.</p>

  <p>Now, Romeo refused to give up. He didn't want to admit defeat even though he knew he was no match for Lisa.</p>

  <p>"Surrender," Lisa insisted. She tilted her head to the side and after a while of thought, she continued, "If you're really mad at Roy, I apologize to you on behalf of him. He shouldn't have killed Monty by mistake."</p>

  <p>The muscles on Romeo's face shuddered at her words.</p>

  <p>It took him a short while to calm down. In the end, he sighed and said, "I admit that I have lost. I am too weak to avenge him. You don't have to apologize to me."</p>

  <p>"Okay." Lisa nodded. She carefully backed a few steps, and then slowly walked away.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Romeo's eyes were unreadable as he watched her receding figure.</p>

  <p>Lisa was neither arrogant nor rash. Even if she had the greater advantage, she was always on her guard and remained calm all the time. He was ashamed of his inferiority and was sincerely convinced by his defeat.</p>

  <p>In this round, Romeo lost.</p>

  <p>After result was declared, the people of the Yellow Emperor race felt relaxed.</p>

  <p>For them, the next battle would just be a one-horse race.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race only had Elsa.</p>

  <p>They guessed that Elsa's strength was about the same as Lisa's.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even if Lisa were to be defeated, they still had Jerome.</p>

  <p>As for David, they just let him be since he was willing to make such a show of himself on the ground anyway.</p>

  <p>He was currently sprawling on the ground with a frown across his face.</p>

  <p>He thought after the Nine Li race had defeated Lisa and Jerome, his clansmen would come and beg him to fight. Then, he would fight reluctantly to save the desperate situation. Wasn't it a worthy try?</p>

  <p>But to his disappointment, It seemed Lisa alone could defeat all the opponents.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the people on the edge of the wilderness discussed the situation among themselves.</p>

  <p>"The die is cast."</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Emperor race should control the Sky South Bone Tower!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, finally, we have driven out those bastards of the Nine Li race!</p>

  <p>We will have a strong lead in the Flying Sickle City afterwards!"</p>

  <p>The competition between the top powers often affected the fate of many people.</p>

  <p>The results made some of them happy, and the others were sad. Those who rooted for the Nine Li race did not look too good. If the Yellow Emperor race had won this battle, they would probably not have a place to settle in the Flying Sickle City anymore.</p>

  <p>After Romeo lost the game, it was Elsa's turn to fight.</p>

  <p>This was a very crucial round, as most people viewed Elsa as the center of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If she was defeated, then the Nine Li race would've lost completely.</p>

  <p>She and Lisa barely communicated. After a brief greeting, they immediately engaged in a fierce fight.</p>

  <p>The purity of the blood naturally decreased as it was passed on from generation to generation, but there would be an occasional miracle.</p>

  <p>For example, the blood in Elsa's body had mutated.</p>

  <p>Her Nine Li Wild Body was covered with a special layer of blood lines.</p>

  <p>Even the exiles couldn't explain why the change took place in her blood.</p>

  <p>Due to the existence of these unique blood lines, Elsa had a considerable advantage in speed, which was the most important skill of the Wild Gods when they turned into giants.</p>

  <p>Thus, Elsa quickly gained the upper hand when the two girls fought.</p>

  <p>Even so, Lisa became much braver after her fight with Romeo. She wielded her black sword in all directions and formed an invincible wall, which firmly blocked Elsa outside.</p>

  <p>In return, Elsa turned into a streak of blood light that constantly rushed towards Lisa's defense. Unfortunately, she failed and was forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>As Lisa resisted Elsa's attacks even more, she advanced step by step until she had forced her opponent to a corner.</p>

  <p>She had already set a net since the very beginning. It wasn't until Elsa had stepped into the net that she finally closed it.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Elsa realized that she couldn't bring her superiority into play.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she eventually stuck her tongue out and helplessly said, "I lost."</p>

  <p>Lisa nodded. Without saying anything, she cautiously took a few steps backward before she quickly walked away.</p>

  <p>Although Lisa had defeated the top talent of the younger generation of the Nine Li race, she remained as level-headed as ever.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Yellow Emperor race had mixed feelings when they found that it was so easy for them to win.</p>

  <p>"If we'd known that the younger generation of the Nine Li race were so weak, we wouldn't have played those tricks at the beginning."</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that the Nine Li race would get worse and worse as time went by."</p>

  <p>They had planned so carefully for a very long time to go all out for the sake of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the Nine Li race was not strong enough to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Adele, our race has won this battle. According to the agreement, your race should withdraw from the area of the Sky South Bone Tower,"</p>

  <p>Lancelot said with a blazing smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He was so happy not only because he would control the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The highlight of the battle was that the younger generation of his race had defeated that of the Nine Li race. He had never imagined that the younger generation of the Nine Li race would be that weak.</p>

  <p>Races needed to constantly produce their best, and the young people represented the future of their race. If such a thing continued, then the Nine Li race would eventually decline.</p>

  <p>Adele just beamed at Lancelot's words, and then she said, "Grand Elder Lancelot, you have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"About what?" His face dimmed. Why hadn't Adele admitted her defeat?</p>

  <p>There would be a huge trouble if the Nine Li race went back on their word and did not surrender the control of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>After all, the Yellow Emperor race did not want to wage a full war just because of it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even if the Yellow Emperor race did win the war, it would mean that they simply took advantage of the Nine Li race's struggles-- and they didn't want to see the losses from the war.</p>

  <p>Adele's beautiful eyes blinked and she looked coldly at Lancelot. "Have you forgotten that there's one person from our race who hasn't fought in battle?"</p>
