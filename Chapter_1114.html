<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little monster had just said that he would not use his life vitality to fight Luo Zheng. He intended to only use his physical strength. However, without his life vitality, he would not be able to fly. Since Luo Zheng was already at the top of the enchanted barrier, how would he be able to attack him?</p>

  <p id="top_3">Since he had already boasted about how he would not need to use his life vitality to fight Luo Zheng, he couldn't break his own words. With that, he started to dart towards the edge of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>With his long hands and legs, the little monster looked bizarre. Once he started moving, though, every part of his body seemed to be playing huge part in what he was trying to achieve, giving him incredible advantage. He started looking streamlined -- a warrior with a goal.</p>

  <p>After running the whole distance of the fighting area within only a few seconds, he came upon the enchanted barrier. Without any hesitation, he started scaling it. When he was halfway to the top, he suddenly did an athletic somersault. With a powerful push against the enchanted barrier, he was finally heading towards the direction where Luo Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw that the little monster had managed to charge at him without using his life vitality, his lips broke out in a sardonic grin.</p>

  <p>A very convenient skill a martial artist had was flying by using his life vitality, so that he could change positions at will. The fact that the little monster had managed to approach Luo Zheng just by merely sprinting and taking a giant leap in the air amazed and disgusted Luo Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's figure vanished into thin air and reappeared behind the little monster, his arms outstretched as if he was trying to reach behind his opponent.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe you are this naive!" he shouted, as he directed a punch towards the little monster's back. He just couldn't help but sneer at him.</p>

  <p>This punch contained the power of three hundred dragon scales. When this power erupted, the little monster flew away like a ball that had been hit by a bat. The little monster crashed towards the other side of the arena and landed face first on the bottom of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Although Luo Zheng was successful in staging his attack, he felt that something was wrong. When his fist came into contact with the little monster's body, he felt that it was very soft. It was as if the little monster didn't have any bones! Even if Luo Zheng had utilized the power of three hundred dragon scales in his strike, the little monster didn't seem to be injured at all.</p>

  <p>Silence befell the arena as the little monster lay on the bottom of the enchanted barrier motionlessly. After a few moments, however, he started stirring and slowly got up. When he was finally standing up, he stared at Luo Zheng with his black eyes, which were much like that of a wild beast in the forest, a vicious smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"You really won't use your life vitality, huh?" Luo Zheng asked flatly, clasping his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>"As I told you -- I don't need to!" the little monster replied, a mocking sneer plastered on his lips. "You are not the kind of opponent that would push me to go all out!"</p>

  <p>Despite the aggressive provocation from the little monster, Luo Zheng made sure that he remained calm and collected. Taking a deep breath, he said to his opponent who was standing on the ground, "If you really enjoy being beat up, then let's continue!"</p>

  <p>The little monster was indeed incredibly vile and condescending, but he knew that his physical strength wouldn't be enough to stage a fight against Luo Zheng. He also knew full well that Luo Zheng was proficient in Space Law. Now, if he didn't use his life vitality to fly, he wouldn't be able to touch even the hem of Zheng's clothing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Once again, the little monster broke out into a run. This time, however, he did not climb the edge of the enchanted barrier. Instead, he directly leapt up straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was undeniable that this little monster's physical power was extremely strong. It was impossible, even for a Life and Death Realm master to be able to possess such a powerful body that would let him or her do such stunts. A warrior at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm just wouldn't compare.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't matter how good he was at jumping or how fast his speed was -- he still wouldn't be able to catch Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment the little monster came face-to-face with Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng took a step forward, traversed through space, and once again showed up behind the little monster. Then he threw another punch.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng activated the power of five hundred dragon scales on top of his own strength. The power that this strike created was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>The little monster leaped higher into the air, but since he couldn't find a place where he could push himself to gain momentum, it became impossible for him to dodge Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A powerful punch once again landed on the little monster's back, again sending him crashing down like a shooting star.</p>

  <p>And just like the first time around, Luo Zheng still failed to hurt him. Seeing this, Luo Zheng clenched his fists, narrowed his eyes, and gritted his teeth. His opponent's ability to withstand powerful blows was on par with that of his own body.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng and the little monster were fundamentally different in their natures. Luo Zheng had transformed his body into a magic weapon, and his body itself was now virtually invincible. After being refined by the Nirvana Flames, he now had the physique that could be considered as a sacred weapon, rendering him insusceptible to injuries and attacks.</p>

  <p>The body of the little monster, however, was on the opposite extreme side of the scale. His body seemed very soft as if he had no bones. That made any attack towards him seem like an attack on a sponge. Realizing this, Luo Zheng understood that it would be hard for him to hurt his opponent.</p>
