<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 642 The Golden Opportunity (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the presence of the three masters of Internal Elixir Realm, no one dared to move. It was as if everyone's body had been frozen.</p>

  <p>Anyone who dared to offend the masters would suffer the same fate as the Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner. That man was punched so hard that his whole body appeared to have been crushed.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng who was always ready to risk his life had not moved. From his assessment, he had a slim chance of successfully escaping from the power of the three masters. It was a chance he wasn't willing to take yet.</p>

  <p>He remained quiet but unsettled. He could sense that something terrible was about to happen!</p>

  <p>"You! If you move, you'll die!" one of the masters of Internal Elixir Realm said nonchalantly. His creepy eyes looked around.</p>

  <p>There was no option but to heed the order of these masters. Everyone remained quiet and still. After quite some time, more than a thousand practitioners appeared on the town road. Most of them were on the nature level. It appeared that they were all tied with ropes with no chance of escaping.</p>

  <p>They had caught so many people this time! It wasn't just a small number, but an alarming number of captives. At this rate, they could wind up all the nature level practitioners in no time. Did they intend to go to the Moon Mountain to get the purple thunder bamboo?</p>

  <p>The troop of captives was being guarded by some practitioners who was walking along the two sides of the road. These practitioners suddenly tossed dark yellow ropes at Luo Luo Zheng and all his fellows.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and his fellows could not dare to defy the three masters of Internal Elixir. So, against their will, they heeded the orders from the guards.</p>

  <p>They were also tied by the ropes and then joined the rest of the captives.</p>

  <p>As he made his way to join the captives, Luo Zheng's mind got clouded with thoughts. He was confused as to why they caught many practitioners.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that acquiring the purple thunder bamboo was quite a challenging task. And the purpose of capturing practitioners was to use them as guinea pigs. Their captors would force them to acquire the purple thunder bamboo on their behalf. But it would entail the risk of losing their lives. However, for their captors, it would give them the hints on how to successfully acquire the bamboos. But the number of captured practitioners here was too high. As Luo Luo Zheng estimated, it was beyond what was needed. So, what on earth were they planning to do?</p>

  <p>In the middle of his deep thoughts, Luo Luo Zheng was interrupted by a sudden noise. A young man in purple, about 29 years old, approached their flock. He appeared to be also a master of Internal Elixir, but on a higher level than the other three.</p>

  <p>As the newly arrived master of the Internal Elixir joined them, the three other masters of the Internal Elixir saluted and greeted,"Young Master!"</p>

  <p>The young man in purple acknowledged their salutations, and directly asked,"Are they enough?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, we have captured a total of 1, 036 people!" One of the masters confidently answered.</p>

  <p>"Great! You've done a great job in finding so many people in such a short time. I will sure to reward your good work and loyalty once we get back to the sect." The young man praised the three masters. He was smiling as he looked at the flock of captives.</p>

  <p>"It's our honor!" One of the masters of Internal Elixir Realm replied with great joy.</p>

  <p>The other two of the masters of Internal Elixir moved to command the captives. The captured practitioners were treated like pigs. They had been pushed around and bullied by the masters. They were even asked to walk forward in a straight line.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng took it as an opportunity to concentrate. Though he was held captive, he tried to recalculate his chances of successfully escaping.</p>

  <p>'There are now four masters of Internal Elixir. Two of them are on the primary level, and one is on the intermediate level, but their leader is on the senior level! Damn it! I should have done it earlier when there was only three masters of Internal Elixir. And what's with so many captives?</p>

  <p>It doesn't matter now! No matter what they will do, I have a feeling that it's not going to be pleasant!</p>

  <p>So, I must escape. But how?' Luo Luo Zheng had thought harder. The dark yellow rope tied to him was not the problem. In fact, he could easily get away from it. However, after he got away from the rope, he would have to face the wrath of the Internal Elixir masters. One wrong move could be the end of him. Luo Zheng's power was nowhere near the masters of Internal Elixir.</p>

  <p>One snap, his body could be crashed. He had to rethink his options.</p>

  <p>There was no use in escaping if he was already dead. Or could death be his only escape?</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's estimate, the troop could be made up of more than one thousand people tied together, which restricted their moves and made them advance slowly. After walking for nearly half a day in the almost endless road, a dark mountain finally came into view. The mountain that resembled a huge elephant was called the Moon Mountain.</p>

  <p>The breathtaking view almost made Luo Luo Zheng forget that he was held captive.</p>

  <p>Upon arriving at the foot of Moon Mountain, the young man in purple took out a jade pendant that looked like a small dragon. He held it up and shook it. The jade pendant seemed to tell which way they should go.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the dragon jade pendant. It looked familiar but he couldn't tell where he had seen it. Suddenly, he felt a quiver in his head.</p>

  <p>"Hey! What's the matter?" Luo Luo Zheng was taken by surprise by the quiver in his head and thought that it came from the cyan dragon. He concentrated his mind on the cyan dragon and asked him,"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>A moment later, Luo Luo Zheng could hear the cyan dragon laughing in his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng got a little annoyed by the insensitive gesture of the cyan dragon at this time. He scolded,"What's wrong with you? Can't you see that I'm in great trouble right now? Does that make you happy?" He was a little irritated now because he couldn't think of a way to escape. He felt hopeless with his situation and the cyan dragon's insensitive remark was not helping him at all.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean you're in great trouble? I don't think so. From how I see it, this can be your golden opportunity!" The cyan dragon said calmly.</p>

  <p>Golden opportunity? Luo Luo Zheng was more confused than he was earlier. He couldn't see the golden opportunity that the cyan dragon was referring to.</p>

  <p>And even if there was, he couldn't comprehend how he could make use of that opportunity in the presence of four masters of Internal Elixir Realm. Luo Luo Zheng was still annoyed at the blabbering cyan dragon. He said,"I don't have time for mind games. Can you be more specific?"</p>
