<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom...</p>

  <p>With the space being folded and compressed, the sound of the explosions was very clear.</p>

  <p>Everyone could see that many fine cracks had appeared around the small skulls. These were the cracks of space.</p>

  <p>This space did not crush the small skulls. Instead, cracks appeared on its own ?</p>

  <p>"No..."</p>

  <p>Perhaps having foreseen this scene before, Preston didn't change his expression at all. With a flip of his hand, he sent a dozen of small skulls flying. His gaze once again focused straight ahead, and more sorcerer race members came forth!</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Preston sent another two space fluctuations toward the skulls!</p>

  <p>The Sky Demon Eliminating Array was a kind of collective. The warriors of the Soul Sea Realm only needed to distribute their life vitality according to the directions given by Preston.</p>

  <p>The biggest flaw of the Sky Demon Eliminating Array, was in fact, Preston himself. As long as he didn't fall, the entire array would be locked down by space and the three hundred warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would be safe!</p>

  <p>Crash, boom, bang...</p>

  <p>A shattering sound was let out once again!</p>

  <p>Creatures from the sorcerer race who had dared to attack were all compressed into a thin piece of black paper and piled up on the ground in all sorts of strange shapes!</p>

  <p>However, all the dead life forms turned into small skulls that raced towards them!</p>

  <p>The small skulls got dispersed by Preston's slap, but no matter how far away they were thrown, they would still turn back unhesitatingly and attack them.</p>

  <p>The more creatures died, the more skulls there would be!</p>

  <p>There was one wave of skulls, followed by a second wave... Forty-five small skulls had already gathered around them?</p>

  <p>As Preston's number of kills increased, the number of small skulls also increased subsequently by leaps and bounds!</p>

  <p>Not long after, over a hundred small skulls were randomly flying in the air!</p>

  <p>Preston was still able to manage such a large number of skulls.</p>

  <p>But an hour later, thousands of small skulls had infiltrated the air!</p>

  <p>These skulls were like garbage in an ocean. As they collided together, crunching sounds echoed through the air. Just a glance at them was enough to send shivers down one's spine!</p>

  <p>Most of the small skulls were racing towards Preston to bite him. Some were dashing to bite the ablaze white lines that were condensed by the Space Law, outside of the Sky Demon Eliminating Array?</p>

  <p>Although the three hundred warriors of the Soul Sea knew that they were doomed to die, their faces turned pale, when they saw a myriad of small skulls.</p>

  <p>Some people were standing on the periphery of the array, and the small skulls were only inches away from them. Preston had said that these skulls would be unable to break the array as long as he didn't collapse but warriors still couldn't help but panic!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they didn't need to do much in this array. As long as they could spend life vitality in accordance to the established rhythm, it would be enough. If it were some other array where they needed to coordinate with each other, it would have probably collapsed long ago.</p>

  <p>But as the small skulls continued biting, the life vitality of the array kept getting consumed. Everyone felt that Preston was frantically using up their life vitality! At this rate, it wouldn't be long before their life vitality sea would dry up!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Warriors constantly crushed the life vitality jades in their hands, and began to replenish the life vitality before it all ran out.</p>

  <p>The more small skulls there were, the more they would bite and the faster their life vitality would be consumed. It was actually possible that the Sky Demon Eliminating Array would eventually be destroyed by the small skulls!</p>

  <p>An hour later, over ten thousand small skulls had accumulated in front of them. These skulls danced in the air, covering the skies. They were sent flying by Preston and scattered everywhere. However, they were like maggots, regrouping and diving down once more to continue devouring the Sky Demon Eliminating Array?</p>

  <p>"I... I can't resist anymore!"</p>

  <p>A core disciple had an extremely weak complexion. He sat down on the ground, but the Soul Sea within his body was still dried up.</p>

  <p>"My life vitality jade is used up!" Another warrior fell down.</p>

  <p>With every warrior that fell, the burden on the remaining warriors increased. The speed at which life vitality was extracted would also become faster, and the complexion of Preston grew more and more unsightly.</p>

  <p>When the Sky Demon Eliminating Array collapsed, people would be nibbled away into a pile of meat by these small skulls in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"Is this resistance futile in the end?"</p>

  <p>As Preston saw the waves of skulls, his heart sank. It wouldn't even take five minutes before all of their life vitality was sucked dry by these wretched things!</p>

  <p>Just then, a group of core disciples, which had been hiding in the depths of the palace, appeared behind the Sky Demon Eliminating Array.</p>

  <p>"Preston, we have come to help you," Yudie's voice sounded suddenly.</p>

  <p>The helplessness and sadness on her incomparably beautiful face had faded away, and it was replaced by a resolute expression.</p>

  <p>The core disciples following Ning Yudie all wore the same expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>    </p>
