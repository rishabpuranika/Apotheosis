<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A warrior paved his cultivation path towards a unique goal.</p>

  <p>Some saw it as a road towards unlimited power and resources. Some saw it as a stepping stone to achieve recognition. Some saw it as an easy way to get beautiful women.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was obsessed with the practice of cultivation itself. His main motivation was not gold, power, or glory but the sheer interest he had for it.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Luo Zheng had created his very own sword move? the No Move.</p>

  <p>This time, he practiced a cultivation method that had been practiced by no one before. It was like walking a new, undiscovered path. He knew it was bound to be difficult, but he had faith that it would lead to a beautiful face.</p>

  <p>The large fireball greatly alarmed the warriors of Cloud Hall, but they quickly calmed down when they heard that it was only Luo Luo Zheng cultivating.</p>

  <p>No one would dare argue nor admonish him. Luo Luo Zheng, first and foremost, was a disciple of Cloud Hall's Elite House. Moreover, he was now also the number one warrior in Central Region and the husband of Cloud Hall's leader? nobody could really consider him as a mere disciple anymore.</p>

  <p>Now that he had finished his goal of returning to the Eastern Region and taking Mu Ning back, Luo Luo Zheng could now rest and cultivate in peace here in Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, he was also blessed to be graced with the company of three beauties. It wasn't really as peaceful as he would've hoped since there was still a bit of conflict among them. None really entertained the notion of having to share a husband. Still, their dynamic worked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was relatively carefree and spent most of her time teasing the Ancestral Dragon or idling by Luo Zheng's side. She should've, in theory, already made a breakthrough given the time and ample resources the Cloud Hall provided. Her Purple Power Body also gave her an innate advantage but the young woman just didn't take cultivation that seriously.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning remained stuck at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm and did not seem to have any intention of improving herself? at least that was what Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He actually had some doubts regarding this carefree lady of his. He hadn't forgotten that old man from the Celestial Position race. Luo Luo Zheng had tried to use the memories of the world's will to find out what that old man and Mu Ning talked about back then, but he came up with nothing.</p>

  <p>He figured that it might be because the old man was technically an outsider from this great world so he might not necessarily be able to find out any information about him. Mu Ning, though, was born in the Central Region which made Luo Luo Zheng suspicious. The old man might have done something to shield their conversation, hiding them from the memories of the world's will.</p>

  <p>The only thing Luo Luo Zheng was able to discover was Xi Youqin's mysterious departure from the Cloud Hall that night. She most probably entered the Purple Power World but whatever transpired in there was unknown to him.</p>

  <p>He truly did not intend to pry. He was just worried since Mu Ning had the tendency to be stupid sometimes. It was difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to ask her about it directly and he didn't have any idea how to make her open up to him since she had long been on guard around him. It was an issue he was still trying to work around with.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and Ning Yudie, on the other hand, remained diligent with their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was a somewhat busy woman, spending her days in cultivation while also dealing with the Cloud Hall's affairs. Xi Youqin's constant presence around Luo Luo Zheng irked her, but she really couldn't do anything about it since the young woman was not a disciple of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The one that surprised Luo Luo Zheng the most was Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>She had been very hardworking all this time. The moment she arrived at the Cloud Hall, Mu Ning quickly immersed herself in cultivating the method she had chosen within the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>During the half year Luo Luo Zheng spent being ravaged by chaotic energy, Mu Ning was making leaps and bounds in her cultivation. Her cultivation was now at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, on par with Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had also considerably improved as time went on. He had recently experienced his second life and death tribulation, but it had not been difficult since he was able to redirect the attacks to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, he still remained on guard against the black eye that was hell-bent on destroying him.</p>

  <p>Dealing with such a formidable enemy was incredibly serious.</p>

  <p>Last time, Luo Luo Zheng was lucky and had managed to redirect the black eye's strike to the great world's mountains causing the destruction of around five million mountains. Such a devastating outcome came about from a mere, casual attack from a mighty being. Luo Luo Zheng was certain that if the black eye got serious, he was sure to die. Even though he had fused with the will of the great world and even if he would never die so long as the great world existed, Luo Luo Zheng knew it would be a piece of cake for the black eye to destroy everything.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the black eye did not appear during his life and death tribulation so he was able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The pill that the old man from the Celestial Position race gave him also helped since he noticed his cultivation rise at a faster rate ever since he took it.</p>

  <p>It was after another half year that his third life and death tribulation descended upon him once again.</p>

  <p>A lot of interesting things took place during this time. More and more talents appeared while those from Luo Zheng's generation had finally settled and found their calling.</p>

  <p>Tianming, only in his early twenties, had become the youngest elder in the Cloud Hall. His talent had reached terrifying new heights with his continued comprehension of the Heavenly Sword. Ning Yudie had remarked to Luo Luo Zheng that Tianming was in the running as the next leader of the Cloud Hall, a position she would be vacating once Luo Luo Zheng and she ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>There were, of course, many more talents in the Cloud Hall, and Tianming was sure to have a lot of competition in store for him if he ever wished to vie for the position. Still, Ning Yudie believed that he was a strong, worthy contender.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's rise to power also signaled the advent of the prosperity of Central Region's warriors. The four divine kingdoms remained superior, of course, but it could not be denied that Central Region had come a long way from their initial state.</p>

  <p>The Bloodwood Cliff, Mysterious Luna Hall, Black Mountain Sect... The Ethereal Spirit Sect had just recently been rebuilt and was now focusing on nurturing their pool of warriors. It was highly likely that Central Region's divine-level talents would go on to become Soul Sea Realm masters in the future.</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Luo Zheng took out the token of mountain and held it in his hand. He had never used it, nor did he know the principle behind it.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he activated the token, the information flooded through his mind and he suddenly was able to understand how it worked.</p>

  <p>With this sudden influx of information, the image of the Immortal Mansion appeared right in front of him. It was exactly the same as the one in Cloudy Mountain but relatively smaller in size.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly stepped into this mini Immortal Mansion and was suddenly transported inside. Despite appearing to him as a smaller version, the place he had stepped into was incomparably grand and huge. Of course, it was all an illusion shown to him by the token.</p>

  <p>"So this is how it is supposed to be used," he remarked to himself. If he ever found himself in a pinch, he could take out the token and hide himself in this palace.</p>

  <p>Since he was already here, Luo Luo Zheng made it a point to head towards the library.</p>

  <p>The library was an immense fountain of knowledge from which he could reap endless benefits.</p>

  <p>Instead of searching for cultivation methods, Luo Luo Zheng looked for and gathered information regarding weapon refining and divine texture writing.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book whispered recommendations to his ear all throughout but Luo Luo Zheng still managed to browse a few books he chose himself. In one of these books, he had unexpectedly managed to obtain some information regarding the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>According to the source, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain could actually be collected.</p>

  <p>It contained the power of five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. It was also extremely sturdy and unbreakable.</p>

  <p>It was also the reason why nobody in the four divine kingdoms showed any intention of targeting it.</p>
