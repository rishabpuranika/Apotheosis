<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2115 The Slab's Punishment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng entered the passageway, Wynn had provided a piece of crucial information. "In theory, the Godly Genius is allowed to enter the divine land. However, if they were to sneak into the divine land, they would be punished by the latter. Hence, ever since the ancient times and up until today, only a very limited few secondary creatures have chosen to sneak their way in."</p>

  <p>"The smuggling will be punished?" Wynn's words had stunned Luo Zheng. "But I don't understand! When I'm in the fairy palace..."</p>

  <p>"That's because you haven't left the Swirl Forest yet. If you enter the divine land through Holy Bromley's fairy palace, even if you manage to leave the Swirl Forest safely, you'll still be punished. This rule was amended by the Jiang Clan."</p>

  <p>After the Jiang Clan had taken charge of the ascension, they helped the Holy Beings in the Hall of Holy Beings in guiding the secondary creatures who ascended. Every single creature who ascended to the divine land would be recorded from then on.</p>

  <p>The warriors who successfully ascended to the divine land were considered valuable resources to the Holy Beings. After all, martial artists that ascended from their own universe were all True Gods and they relied solely on themselves when it came to condensing their own Godly Tiles. True Gods like these were also viewed as extremely popular talents across the divine land.</p>

  <p>Following countless years of development though, the Hall of Holy Beings had formulated a set of detailed rules in order to balance out the interests of the various great clans as well as the Holy Beings. Those who ascended to the divine land were actually distributed according to the Floating Islands' ranks. The powerful warriors that a few Holy Beings cultivated in their inner worlds were taken away by others, which caused them to become displeased and angry.</p>

  <p>And thus during a good period of time, a great number of warriors were stolen into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Certain Holy Beings even brought their inner worlds' Godly Geniuses directly into the divine land for training.</p>

  <p>In a fit of rage, the Jiang Clan immediately changed the rules on the stone slab in order to restrict the Holy Beings from doing such a thing.</p>

  <p>The few martial artists that still dared to steal their way into the divine land would certainly receive the stone slab's punishment. From then on, only very few secondary creatures dared to secretly immigrate the land; after all, the stone slab's rules were not to be violated by anyone.</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of such a serious matter in the past... Why have you never mentioned this before?" Luo Zheng asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled slightly. "Master has already taken this question into consideration."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly remembered something. "My blood?"</p>

  <p>Wynn nodded briskly. "Yes. The blood that has been inherited by the Celestial Position race was prepared for the Godly Geniuses. This kind of blood can avoid tracking and punishment, but those who utilize it will ultimately face unpredictable consequences."</p>

  <p>If they hadn't swapped Zheng's blood though, then Murphy would discover him the very moment he set foot in the divine land. At this point, the serious consequence could only be imagined.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea at the time of his blood transfer that the golden blood even had such a function. He then asked, "What are the unpredictable consequences?"</p>

  <p>This time, Wynn shook his head in dismay. "There is no way to tell. This matter can only be left up to fate. After all, avoiding the stone slab's punishment is far from being an easy matter. Even Murphy wouldn't succeed!"</p>

  <p>"Are you saying even a Holy Being can't escape the punishment?" Luo Zheng was slightly surprised, but he felt gutted.</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled calmly. "It doesn't matter anymore. This is the only chance you have. You have no idea how much effort your father has put in to achieve this."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, his eyes glimmering. "I see..."</p>

  <p>After bidding farewell to Wynn and Master Feng, Luo Zheng stepped into the passageway.</p>

  <p>The passageway didn't actually pierce through the Sighing Wall, but was instead only a very special space passageway placed on the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>The law within was completely different from the Space Law that Luo Zheng knew. He couldn't even feel the fluctuation of any Law Power. He felt so lost and disoriented.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng stepped inside, he felt an irresistible force wrap around him. At the same time, he felt himself being pulled towards the depths of the passageway. Suddenly, his entire body began to twirl at high speeds, like a spinning top.</p>

  <p>While this process occurred, Luo Zheng tried to control the shape of his body and stop the spinning. It certainly didn't take long before he discovered that he was unable to use the Space Law, nor was he able to fly here in this passageway.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng now understood that after stepping into this passageway, he had already entered the divine land. After all, his feeling in this situation very much resembled his feeling in the fairy palace's divine land space!</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng let himself go, his only option being to spin along the passageway.</p>

  <p>The sense of space and time gradually blurred within Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>He felt as though what he had just experienced was spread over a short period of time, and yet simultaneously, he felt as though it had taken him an extremely long time to cross what seemed to be an endless path...</p>

  <p>An unknown amount of time had passed, Luo Zheng literally had no idea, before his body suddenly felt lighter. The force that had wrapped around him earlier disappeared, and with a loud bang, he suddenly fell down.</p>

  <p>'Am I in the air?</p>

  <p>The vegetable patch!'</p>

  <p>Zheng's reaction time was extremely fast. Despite spinning so rapidly, he could still see the scenery around him. Below him was a square of vegetable patch!</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>Not even a few seconds later, Luo Zheng crashed flat into the vegetable patch.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's body were to smash into a vegetable patch, it had the possibility of creating a huge hole with a radius of at least ten thousand feet!</p>

  <p>That though, was only a possibility within the universe!</p>

  <p>The universe was constructed from life vitality while the divine land, on the other hand, was formed by the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The difference of the two was like the difference between a secondary creature and an ordinary creature. The materials sourced within the divine land were naturally different, too.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng smashed into the vegetable patch, he looked around himself, only to notice that he had created nothing more than a small crater and a few crushed seedlings.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Zheng's strong physical body, he had avoided injured. What he did have now was a deep impression of this hard vegetable patch.</p>

  <p>Prior to this experience, he thought only the Swirl Forest could be so sturdy. Now, he finally understood that everything in the entire divine land was probably of such strength.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng fell from the sky, in the depths of the divine land, a line of small characters suddenly flashed with a faint light on a stone slab behind the Hall of Holy Beings. Quickly after this light flashed, it turned into a palm print that shot out from the stone slab!</p>

  <p>Once the lightning bolt had shot out, sudden sounds rang out surprisingly from the depths of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on here? Why did the stone slab let the punishment descend again?"</p>

  <p>"The 833rd rule has been activated. Someone is sneaking in from somewhere in the universe..."</p>

  <p>"But it's so strange!</p>

  <p>This is the second time someone has stolen into the divine land recently!"</p>

  <p>After the palm print shot out, it disappeared from the Time Sea and quietly fled through the vast space of the divine land. Soon, it appeared once again, but in a different, particular region...</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng came back to his senses, he saw a giant palm print appear with a burst in the sky!</p>

  <p>The very second he noticed the lightning, fear completely washed over him and broke out in a cold sweat. He knew what that black palm print meant. The power it contained was enough to kill him a thousand times over!</p>

  <p>Therefore, upon seeing the lightning bolt, he also mourned himself silently in his heart. This time, he was probably done for. He also thought that he didn't deserve such treatment to be beaten to death by this palm when all he had done so far was to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>After the palm print was in full view, it didn't hesitate a second longer before striking down toward Luo Zheng. By the time it was halfway toward Luo Zheng, he felt his body suddenly warming up as the golden blood in his body began to burn!</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the palm print seemed confused, having lost its target, and it looked like a headless fly circling over and over again ten miles above Zheng's head. It just wasn't capable of locking down on Luo Zheng anymore.</p>

  <p>'So that's how it is!' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the sky, a faint smile now slowly spreading on his lips.</p>

  <p>He instantly understood that Wynn had been right. The golden blood could indeed help him escape punishment...</p>

  <p>This black palm print continued circling around for quite a while but never found Luo Zheng. After some time, it turned into a black ball and came crashing down from the sky!</p>

  <p>'This is bad!' Zheng's thoughts were whirling now.</p>

  <p>Immediately upon seeing the scene, he knew something was wrong. He turned his head and ran toward the other side of the vegetable patch.</p>

  <p>The moment the black ball hit the ground, it exploded, sending out several clumps of black threads. The threads interweaved themselves in order to form a huge web that spread out in all directions. This web spread at an extremely high speed. Even though Luo Zheng was running as fast as his legs could carry him, the web wasn't escapable.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>Strands of black, hair-like threads shot toward and into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>These black threads didn't cause any substantial physical damage to Zheng's body, but they tightly wrapped around his cinnabar field. And after his cinnabar field was completely bounded, he immediately felt as though he had lost contact with his inner world!</p>

  <p>'This... This can't be happening...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, suddenly felt overwhelmingly shocked and confused.</p>

  <p>Wynn had reminded him on several occasions that there might be unpredictable consequences, and Luo Zheng was well-prepared.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he never expected that the consequence he would face would be one like this. His own cinnabar field was sealed and he was unable to extract the chaotic energy and strength source within. Thus, he lost the two greatest things that he relied on...</p>
