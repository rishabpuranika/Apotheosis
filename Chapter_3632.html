<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3632 Corpse Spirit Jin Wu </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the demon woman of the Divine Lair floated backwards for several thousand feet, she removed the Invisibility Curtain from her.</p>

  <p>"Drip, drip, drip..."</p>

  <p>A big hole in her chest flowed with blood as a result from Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>But though she seemed seriously injured, it was not fatal to her at all.</p>

  <p>As she flapped her wings profusely, her voice echoed majestically into the nine positions. "I thought I could capture the Mountain Sea Pass in one go, but I had no idea that you people had skill," she snickered.</p>

  <p>If the Self-exploding Jin Wu kept bursting and if Luo Zheng hadn't forced her to show up, the array of the Mountain Sea Pass would have collapsed. The divine crystals stored in the pass wouldn't be able to hold on for too long.</p>

  <p>"Bitch, stop talking nonsense!" a Oneness General scolded. "Don't run away!"</p>

  <p>As the woman heard this, her pale face still perked up to a smirk. "I've been here the whole damn time," she said sweetly. "I don't intend to run away."</p>

  <p>"Oh yeah? Then let's see if you really have what it takes!" the other Oneness General in the same position shouted.</p>

  <p>Just as he stopped speaking, both of them darted towards the woman at the same pace.</p>

  <p>As they moved, the position that shielded them followed.</p>

  <p>This was a defensive tactic, because as long as they were in the position, they were safe. To them, it would be no problem to chase the woman because of her injury. Luckily for them, Sinclair had no intention of stopping them. They were going to return anyway.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gradually retracted the more than one hundred swords and activated his hearing sense. The soft, sweet voice of the woman rang in his ears, and his heart began to beat quickly. However, once he saw the two Oneness Generals going after the woman, his face suddenly changed. "General Sinclair!" Luo Zheng called out. "Please ask them to come back quickly.</p>

  <p>Something is wrong! They're being enchanted by the woman!"</p>

  <p>Originally, the seventeen Oneness Generals, including Luo Zheng, had already been nervous.</p>

  <p>But because Luo Zheng repelled the demon woman from the Divine Lair, they had more hope.</p>

  <p>The woman should have escaped, but after she distanced herself from them, she showed up and used her voice to enchant the two Oneness Generals.</p>

  <p>"Kemp!</p>

  <p>Hargrove! Come back this instant!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair also had a feeling something bad was going to happen.</p>

  <p>At this point, the two Oneness Generals were deaf to Sinclair. They kept rushing towards the woman, the position of the array protecting them, and never looked back.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Their position is connected to the main array," someone pointed out. "If they move too far away from the main array, it'll make the entire Mountain Sea Pass suffer!"</p>

  <p>The nine positions of the array were all somewhat connected to the main array, which meant that all attacks on the positions would implicate the entire Mountain Sea Pass. Because of the two Oneness Generals, a position had been compromised. This gave the Jin Wu an opportunity to attack it, and disintegrate the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>After Sinclair had attempted to call them back, his expression grew cold.</p>

  <p>"Cut off the Earth Dragon Position! Now!"</p>

  <p>This was the position that Kemp and Hargrove used as protection. Once it was disconnected, the two would be left exposed and easily devoured by the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Sinclair had no choice, and he had to make a decision that was for the benefit of more than just the two Oneness Generals.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Once he gave the final order, a wave of energy spread out. It disconnected Kemp and Hargrove from the main array.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly, a group of Jin Wu spiraled down and headed straight towards the two Oneness Generals.</p>

  <p>The demon woman appeared behind the two, grabbed their heads by the hair, and said disappointingly, "Alas, you were resolute in action, or I would have captured the Mountain Sea Pass already."</p>

  <p>"Queenie, you arrived earlier than us," a voice hissed. "If you want to capture the pass all alone, then the full credit will go to you. We will have nothing to do with this."</p>

  <p>Behind her, more than ten demon women from the Divine Lair were approaching. They all had powerful, demonic auras that made it obvious they had obtained extraordinary Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!" Queenie shouted at them. "Hurry and heal my damn wounds!"</p>

  <p>The woman floating behind her moved closer and stretched out her hand.</p>

  <p>With one wave, a circular corona appeared.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>The woman fiddled with the corona, moving the shadow of time to an hour earlier. Just like that, Queenie's chest was healed.</p>

  <p>"Queenie, you are too ambitious," the demon woman said after tucking the corona away. "Even if you manage to capture the Mountain Sea Pass, you won't make it through the Sky Net."</p>

  <p>"The Sky Net has its own flaws we can work around. After we capture the Mountain Sea Pass, our next move is to figure out how to break the net,"</p>

  <p>Queenie responded confidently.</p>

  <p>"It's not that simple," the woman shot back. "The seven arrays and twelve passes are two lines of defense. After we capture the Mountain Sea Pass, the Vastness Array will be waiting for us," the woman trailed away, trying to seem less worried. "I'm afraid we cannot go up against the warriors of the Vastness Array."</p>

  <p>Queenie frowned hearing this. "So, what do you propose we do?"</p>

  <p>"I bet we can capture the Mountain Sea Pass and break the Sky Net," the woman said as she pointed at the distance. "We need to seek help from the inside. As long as someone can help us from there, breaking the Sky Net will be a piece of cake."</p>

  <p>"Someone to help us inside? Who?" Queenie raised her eyebrows. "Why didn't Master Phoenix tell me about this?"</p>

  <p>The woman smiled. "Because Master Phoenix will come in person."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Behind the group of demon women, the black Jin Wu parted to both sides, which sent over a hundred huge Jin Wu to gradually descend.</p>

  <p>Because the huge Jin Wu brought out a heavy aura, it made the other crows become restless and uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Corpse Spirit Jin Wu!"</p>

  <p>Queenie was surprised to see the Jin Wu descending, especially because they were so strong.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were personally nurtured by Emperor Ji, which made them the strongest of the Jin Wu. They had been hidden underground, only to appear when the Divine Lair was attacked.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu could only be used if the Jin Wu was ever in danger.</p>

  <p>Phoenix appeared, standing steadily on the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that appeared. She looked down at the Sky Net in the distance with a dignified expression.</p>

  <p>"Master Phoenix..."</p>

  <p>Before Queenie could finish her sentence, Phoenix raised her hand and stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Our Jin Wu has no choice but to go all out," Phoenix said. "We might suffer our biggest loss in battle with the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Worst-case scenario, we will disappear from the world for good." Phoenix let out a huge sigh, saddened by the thought of their defeat.</p>

  <p>She knew for a fact that the entire Source World, as well as the chaos, would undergo a great reformation eventually.</p>

  <p>The battle between the Jin Wu and the Taiyi Heaven Palace marked the beginning of that change.</p>

  <p>But as the leader of the Divine Lair, Phoenix couldn't help but feel sorry for her people. "I only hope that you find a way to escape this calamity and be among the lucky ones who survive," she said solemnly. "Only then can you live forever."</p>
