  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Source World, on a black ship, a golden ring suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>From below this golden ring, a figure then emerged; it was the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"G... Grandmaster of Heaven, what business do you have here?" asked Shera as she strode towards him, astonished by his arrival.</p>

  <p>People from the Other Shore would usually inform the Black Ship first before they showed up. Only after the crew had made the arrangements would they land at the world.</p>

  <p>Since the Grandmaster of Heaven had shown up unannounced, Shera suspected something major must have happened on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"The Three Purities Stage has collapsed to ruins," revealed the Grandmaster of Heaven with pure shock written all across his face. He was having trouble believing what took place himself.</p>

  <p>He had been to the Jade Pure Realm before and knew what the Treacherous Beings were capable of. But even so, destroying the Three Purities Stage was not easy work.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Shera covered her mouth, overtaken by surprise.</p>

  <p>'The Three Purities Stage represents the top force on the Other Shore, how could it come to such an end?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>"Who's responsible for the destruction? Is it the Snake Spirit King?"</p>

  <p>A voice came from beside the Grandmaster of Heaven. A dark green grass then began growing rapidly on the deck and blooming, before a bean pod formed.</p>

  <p>The pod opened and a green creature came out. The blurry figure cleared into the Evil God. It was he who threw these questions at the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked on at him in admiration on seeing his ability to create his appearance in that way. 'This guy is really quite proficient in the laws of the Source World.</p>

  <p>I heard he can possess other creatures and live within them. It now seems he is able to materialize a living being of his own and appear like this, ' thought the Grandmaster of Heaven to himself.</p>

  <p>"It was not the Snake Spirit King. It's someone with a strange appearance; he is humanoid," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? Where is he from?" asked the Evil God with his head tilted in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I have no clue," answered the Grandmaster of Heaven with a deep frown.</p>

  <p>"What? Even you do not know who he is?" questioned the Evil God with raised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>He was even more arrogant than before. In his eyes, the Grandmaster of Heaven was someone to provide him with any useful information he might need. If he couldn't even do that, he was useless to him.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't in the Jade Pure Realm when the fight broke out and so I have no knowledge of what took place there," the Grandmaster of Heaven responded with his eyebrows furrowed, disappointed by his ignorance. He could tell by his voice and expression that the Evil God did not take him seriously and that no doubt got under his skin.</p>

  <p>"What about the Bird Spirit Sect? What became of the bird spirits?" inquired the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"The Bird Spirit King could not even defend himself and is now under that creature's control," answered the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect had fallen apart, leaving the Nihility race without protection. The Grandmaster of Heaven replied only to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Considering his current situation, he had no choice but to endure his ill treatment.</p>

  <p>"What? You mean to say that even the Bird Spirit King was controlled?" repeated the Evil God as a seriousness began filling his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew what the Monkey Spirit King was capable of and assumed the Bird Spirit King was around the same level in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>However, since the Grandmaster of Heaven knew little about the humanoid creature, the Evil God could not be sure of his strength.</p>

  <p>Just then, another golden ring emerged above the center of the ship.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Shera all looked up at the same time. 'Who else is coming?</p>

  <p>Are there any survivors in the Jade Pure Realm?' wondered the three of them, surprised by what was unfolding.</p>

  <p>The outline of a huge bird then became visible beneath the golden ring.</p>

  <p>"It is a Bird Master?" guessed the Evil God with a new light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Before long, one of the Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect came into view. It was none other than Duran.</p>

  <p>"Master Duran, you..." Duran's presence caught the Grandmaster of Heaven by great surprise.</p>

  <p>"The Jade Pure Realm has been destroyed. I was lucky to have made it out alive," Duran announced indifferently, a visible sadness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What about the other Bird Masters?" inquired the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Lawler and Orval didn't make it. In fact, all those who tried attacking the Snake Spirit Sect died at the hands of the downgrader," answered Duran flatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had proposed holding onto the Bird Masters' coordinates before they set foot in the Jade Pure Realm. The Bird Spirit Sect stood on the opposite side of the human race after all.</p>

  <p>Duran had handed his coordinates over to Luo Zheng and they were destroyed when the energy balls hit the Monkey Spirit King. But just as Sewell did, Duran had two sets of coordinates and he could travel back and forth between them.</p>

  <p>After he was killed and his coordinates were removed, Duran was resurrected using his second set of coordinates. They were placed on the edge of the Jade Pure Realm and although the energy balls shone on the Jade Pure Realm, they did not reach its corner.</p>

  <p>Duran chose to come to the Source World using the Descending Ring after his rebirth.</p>

  <p>"The downgrader? Is he that powerful?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>Last time Duran had arrived at the Source World, he tried to lure him to their side. But now those hopes had disappeared and the plans no longer existed. "The downgrader is far stronger than you could imagine. His strength is beyond everyone in the main world. We are done for. We just have to accept it," said Duran in despair.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's and Shera's hearts both stopped in fear when they heard these words. 'Is the downgrader really so powerful?' they both wondered.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, however, smiled seeming unfazed by all this. "Is that so? Is he really all that difficult to deal with that we ought to just give in?"</p>

  <p>"You're just a creature of the third-grade world. You can't even comprehend all that goes on in the main world. Do you honestly think you'll be any kind of match for a being from the Deep Space?" Duran blurted, impatient with his challenging words.</p>

  <p>He had never cared for the Evil God's arrogance. Now that he felt they would all die, he felt no need to keep up the act and spoke his true feelings.</p>

  <p>His retorts did not bother the Evil God. The Evil God snapped his fingers and a wisp of cyan flames appeared. "Is this one of the bloodline powers in the main world?" asked the Evil God tauntingly.</p>

  <p>With a glance at the fire, Duran responded, "The sixth ability of the destruction quadrant. That's no big deal. Don't waste my time showing that off in front of me!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God snapped his fingers and another flame arose, this time purple. "This is also a bloodline power of the main world, right?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"The third ability of the destruction quadrant," Duran snorted defiantly.</p>

  <p>These two types of fire were among the most common abilities obtained from the ancestry-level bloodline, so Duran recognized them at a glance.</p>

  <p>But he had missed a significant detail; where had the Evil God acquired these bloodline powers?</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had not ignored it though. "Evil God, you have never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting. How did you get your hands on those?" he asked, staring at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's words brought something to Duran's mind.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the bloodline powers? Did you reach the Eternal Realm in the Source World?" he asked, narrowing his eyes at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, although there were Eternal Realm warriors in the Source World, the root-level bloodlines they had inherited were garbage.</p>

  <p>Even if the Evil God reached the Eternal Realm, acquiring the two flames that he had displayed was impossible. He too now began wondering how he had come to possess these two bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't answer. Instead he smiled and suggested, "How about some magic? The third flame..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white fire burst from the Evil God's mouth. It was the twelfth ability of the destruction quadrant.</p>

  <p>The three flames quickly intertwined.</p>

  <p>"Did you blend some bloodlines?" Duran mused calmly.</p>

  <p>That he had acquired the bloodline powers was surprising, but blending some bloodlines was not difficult. In the Four Spirits Sect, many beings at Duran's level knew how to blend bloodlines.</p>
