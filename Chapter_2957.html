  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guards returned to the Floating Island with a profound change in attitude.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had learned in the Sea of Truth about the defeat of the Nine Li race and Chiyou's death. However, the Nine Li Guards had still had faith in their Grand Chieftain's ability to save them and restore their honor.</p>

  <p>Now that Chiyou's own message had corroborated the news, the case was closed.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Ramzi and other Nine Li Guards had been eager to go back to the Source World to find the rest of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>This goal in mind, they had all been dedicating their time to studying the Trumpet Flying Ship. Now, however, they saw no point in continuing their endeavor. If Chiyou and most of his people were dead, what was the point of traveling to the Source World?</p>

  <p>Lorena knew she had been lucky to have had a chance to see her father one last time before he died. She had no regrets, but she grieved nonetheless, for her father and for the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Mike tried to offer his support to Lorena, but it did not seem genuine to her and thus offered little solace. Mike was not, after all, related to the Nine Li race in any way. All he could do was tell Lorena to talk to Rosie.</p>

  <p>After Samuel's death, Rosie had been released and went to live on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Even though Rosie's and Lorena's physical strength was far from mediocre, their cultivation couldn't improve much further due to their loss of the support of their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>There was a way out of this conundrum, however, and it was simple: all they had to do was reincarnate through their Memory Flames. The new physical body would create a new inner world, and allow them to cultivate and then cross the Sea of Truth to the Other Shore again.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Rosie had spent the past few days busy, preparing to reincarnate.</p>

  <p>She had never expected that her sister would come bearing news of their father's death. Unexpected and devastating as this news was, the most they could do was stay together and offer each other comfort.</p>

  <p>Yet, not everyone had been touched by grief. Emily, one of the powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm, was hopeful and optimistic.</p>

  <p>That was not to say she was indifferent to Chiyou's passing: she felt the burden of sadness as much as anyone, but her delight at learning that Chiyou's dying wish had been to send Yan to the Li Shan mountain overwhelmed any sense of grief she had.</p>

  <p>Emily had been very interested in Yan when she was outside the divine land, but due to Yan's inability to enter into chaos, she had had no chance to meet her.</p>

  <p>After entering the divine land, however, Emily had found Yan immediately and tested her bloodline.</p>

  <p>The blood which was sealed up with the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed was definitely extraordinary.</p>

  <p>So her only wish was to take Yan back to the Li Shan mountain. Yan, however, wanted to stay in the divine land alongside her parents and Luo Zheng. She would hardly leave her families and go with Emily voluntarily.</p>

  <p>However, this was an order from Chiyou. Yan would want to respect and heed his request.</p>

  <p>However, it was not just a matter of Yan's willingness. Whether or not she would go depended on Luo Zheng's plans as well as Lorena's and Mike's decision.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the chaos, when the prison was opened, nearly all the powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm left.</p>

  <p>Only a few among the Wild Gods wished to remain, and continued to expand the influence of their races.</p>

  <p>At a corner of a bone tower, a man in black looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>Sand-colored masses floated above him, like clouds of condensed mist.</p>

  <p>From his perspective, the speed of the chaos clouds was very slow, but he knew this was only an illusion due to their size. In fact, they were moving much faster.</p>

  <p>The same applied to the pale red gem that floated in the sky. It appeared the gem was moving slowly, but it was not. It was the divine land that was moving away, accelerating as it left further and further away from the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Finally, it left. Is it going to return to the Source World?" the man in black whispered.</p>

  <p>He pulled back the hood of his long black cloak, revealing long hair of ebony as deep as the velvet that had just covered it. The hair framed his face, wrinkled, with heavy, drooping features, like those of an old man that had seen a thousand wars.</p>

  <p>After having made sure that the divine land was indeed moving away from them, the man in black ascended the stairs to the top of the bone tower, and swiftly dashed downwards along the surface of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>Normally, it would have taken a few months to fall from the top of the bone tower and reach the ground. However, the man in black was no ordinary being; with a sweep of his cloak, he transformed into an inky black wind and gushed along the surface of the tower at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>He was so fast that it only took him under a minute to reach the bottom of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>If even a grain of dust were to move at such speed, it would carry a massively destructive amount of energy. A person traveling at that speed was more than a lethal weapon. It was enough to leave a giant, scorched crater at the base of the bone tower if protective measures were not used.</p>

  <p id="top_8">The man in the black cloak, however, was no fool. The moment he was a few meters above the ground, he suddenly came to a pause. He had created an invisible cushion in mid-air to absorb the force of his descent, and landed on the ground lightly on tiptoe, graceful as a dancer.</p>

  <p>Then, he flew on the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>He had met many Wights on the way, and they fled in fear at the sight of him as he passed them by.</p>

  <p>Before long, the man had arrived at an area of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>He lifted his foot and stomped on the ground. The entire area of the wilderness began trembling violently, emitting a deep rumbling noise.</p>

  <p>"That's it, I'm going to get out of here! Did you hear me?!" roared the man in black.</p>

  <p>A deep silence descended onto the Immemorial Wilderness. It was a wide expanse of flat land, like a barren steppe. His voice echoed in the emptiness.</p>

  <p>The man in black did not give up and stomped on the ground again, harder this time.</p>

  <p>The stomp shattered an innumerable amount of wild bones, forming an enormous, thousand-foot deep crater. "Now can you hear?" yelled the man again. "Gerald! Answer me!"</p>

  <p>He yelled, desperation coloring his voice. Silence answered him once again.</p>

  <p>"You think you are right, but please, think again! I may help him before he gets the needed potential. But once he has it, I will find a chance to replace him!" the man in black howled again, his voice growing louder and louder.</p>

  <p>It was so loud that it created a hurricane that swept through the steppe, sending wild bones flying in all directions.</p>

  <p>By then, the man had realized that Gerald would not respond. In a rage, he stretched out his fist, his eyes filled with hatred. "You'll be lying here all your life!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he had finished speaking, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his fist. Without hesitation, he punched downwards.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>This time, the ground beneath the whole "prison" began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Beneath the man's feet, the area of Immemorial Wilderness which was over ten million miles wide, began to expand and it had risen by several hundred thousand feet within seconds. It continued to expand crazily until it could stretch no more. Finally, it exploded in a burst of dazzling light, like a supernova, leaving behind nothing but ash.</p>

  <p>His punch had not only destroyed this area of Immemorial Wilderness, but it had also created a huge crater over a hundred million feet deep!</p>

  <p>The huge head that had been buried at the bottom of this area of the Immemorial Wilderness had finally revealed its true face!</p>

  <p>The giant skull had been stripped of all its skin and flesh, but it still exuded a vast aura, and its empty eyes seemed to tell a thousand tales without uttering a single word.</p>

  <p>The man in black glared at the huge skull. Angry as he was, he would not dare step on it. He turned to leave.</p>

  <p>A long time elapsed since the man in back had left. Suddenly, the skull he had left behind began to emit a faint light from its eyes. Then, it started to move side to side, and finally it dived down, burrowing into the depths of the earth.</p>
