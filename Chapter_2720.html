  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the two altars beside him, then he looked at the Stone Mouse and asked, "Why is there nothing on those two altars?"</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse squeaked and replied, "The Jade Scale Butterfly and the Flame Blood Vulture are supposed to be on the two altars. They have the same mission as me, but they have never been reincarnated in all these years."</p>

  <p>"Flame Blood Vulture..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had come across this name when he had read through the ancient books on the Floating Island of the Han clan.</p>

  <p>But the record in the ancient books about the Flame Blood Vulture was not very clear. It only mentioned that the Flaming Blood Vulture was something that had appeared in the extremely ancient remote ages.</p>

  <p>As for the Jade Scale Butterfly, he had never heard of it!</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse had to have its corpse thrown back on the altar if it wanted to be reincarnated. It was very likely that these two unique true spirits had died in some corner of the divine land and no one had ever discovered them.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the door again. "Does one have to enter that door to gain control over this Reincarnation Land?"</p>

  <p>"That's right! Anyone who wants to rule this Reincarnation Land can only do so by entering that door first!" answered the Stone Mouse obediently.</p>

  <p>Back then, the owner of the Stone Mouse had entered the door, but he had not been acknowledged. It was not because he was not strong enough, but because of the problem of the bloodline.</p>

  <p>But in Zheng's case, the Stone Mouse actually wanted him to enter. If he could be killed inside, it would be perfect!</p>

  <p>"In that case, please get some rest first," Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>"Rest?" The Stone Mouse was stunned by his suggestion.</p>

  <p>Just as it was recovering from the shock, Zheng lightly patted its head wickedly.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's cultivation was equal to that of a proving godly warrior. How could it resist Zheng at all?</p>

  <p>A stream of power poured into the Stone Mouse's head and it exploded immediately. It was dead again.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't throw its corpse back to the altar this time, but put it in his space ring.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse was still very loyal to Gregorio, so Zheng would be uneasy if he just left it outside. No one knew what kind of trouble it would make if it was left unsupervised.</p>

  <p>After trapping the Stone Mouse in his ring, Zheng walked past the three altars and headed straight for the huge door.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the top of the stairs, Zheng flicked his finger.</p>

  <p>A fire ball was produced, which shot into the air and exploded again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The enormous door was illuminated as bright as the sun under the light of the explosion.</p>

  <p>"What a mammoth door!" exclaimed Zheng as he looked up at it.</p>

  <p>He had noticed from afar that the door was huge, but it was only after he got close did he discover just how high it really was. It was unlike anything he had ever imagined.</p>

  <p>It was over a hundred thousand feet high from the ground� tall enough for a mighty mountain to be stuffed within it!</p>

  <p>Zheng placed his hands on the huge door and took a momentary pause to prepare himself. Then he began to slowly activate his strength!</p>

  <p>"Break open!"</p>

  <p>His physical strength was unleashed and it circulated and gushed forth into Zheng's hands, transferring over to the huge door.</p>

  <p>When he pushed the door with all his might, the sculpture with three heads and six arms on the gate began to glow.</p>

  <p>Chiyou's lifelike eyes shone with a deep red luster, as if two gems were embedded in his sockets.</p>

  <p>However, the door remained motionless!</p>

  <p>"The door is so heavy!" Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical strength was more powerful than that of an ordinary consummate True God, or about the same as that of a Demi-Holy Being.</p>

  <p>But even so he was still unable to push the door open.</p>

  <p>"Strength source!"</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed, and the power in his inner world surged and coursed through his veins.</p>

  <p>"Open!"</p>

  <p>With a dull roar, a ginormous force was released from his arms.</p>

  <p>On the door, the red light that was emitting from Chioyou's eyes became brighter, but the obstinate door still did not budge!</p>

  <p>"That's so weird!" Zheng was staring at the door with his eyes wide open in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The strength source in his inner world, coupled with his physical strength, would make his overall strength on par with that of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Gregorio had been able to push this door open back then, so there was no reason for Zheng to fail. Naturally, he couldn't figure out why it was so difficult for him.</p>

  <p>"If my guess is correct, Chiyou's eyes on this door should be the Limit Stone. So it doesn't need too much power to push it away," No. 9527 suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"Limit Stone? What do you mean?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 smiled and said, "The Limit Stone is just a small trick to detect your maximum strength. It needs you to exert your strength to its maximum limit. Even if your strength is not too great, you can still push open the door. The purpose of the giant door is not to block you outside, but merely to observe your maximum power."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng had a skeptic expression.</p>

  <p>He did feel the pair of eyes watching him closely when he pushed the door. Could it be true? Did the Limit Stone really have such an ability?</p>

  <p>Clearly, some things in the Source World were truly beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't waste any more time pondering over it.</p>

  <p>He softly whispered, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>Swish swash!</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure began to increase!</p>

  <p>Back when the Nine Li race left the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, they had distributed the wild bones in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Leaving a part of the wild bones for the Nine Li people in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower to use, the remaining, which was a sizable chunk, was distributed to those who left.</p>

  <p>Zheng had also obtained a considerable number of wild bones during the distribution.</p>

  <p>After he returned to the divine land, Zheng would absorb the wild bones whenever he had time, and his cultivation at the level of Wild God was also slowly increasing.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng's figure had soared up to sixty thousand feet high!</p>

  <p>Although this gate was over a hundred thousand feet high, it looked almost the same with Zheng in terms of size...</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Zheng pounded on the door with his two huge hands, one left and one right.</p>

  <p>The turbulent force thrust forward as he unleashed all his strength!</p>

  <p>In addition to the Wild God Power, the force in his inner world was also activated at the same time.</p>

  <p>Zheng had gone all out for it; he had pushed all his strength to the limit!</p>

  <p>"Open!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted exhaling heavily.</p>

  <p>However, his roar was like a clap of thunder which spread quickly across the world.</p>

  <p>This roar had even stirred up the Memory Flames in the distance. The originally calm Memory Flames began to float in the sea.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the red light in Chiyou's eyes vanished.</p>

  <p>And then it flashed again. This time it started emitting a dark green luster.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>The gears shifted and a jarring sound rang out, followed by a rumble!</p>

  <p>The two gates began to open inwards with a groan.</p>

  <p>When the door opened just a crack, Zheng stopped pushing.</p>

  <p>He shoved the door a smidge just enough to get in, so there was no need to open the door fully.</p>

  <p>The slit in the entryway was now over one hundred feet wide. His Wild God Body was too large to enter but after returning to his normal size, it would be wide enough for him to get in.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>After Zheng withdrew the Wild God Power, he slipped in through the crack.</p>

  <p>When he walked in the door, a billowing cloud of dust rose up instantly, obstructing his vision.</p>

  <p>As the door had been closed for too long, a thick layer of dust had settled everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual wind! Blow!"</p>

  <p>Zheng spat gently, looking at the blanket of dust.</p>

  <p>His breath turned into a hurricane that flew past the world inside the door. All the dust inside was quickly swept away.</p>

  <p>As the dust dissipated, nine colossal statues slowly appeared in front of Zheng.</p>
