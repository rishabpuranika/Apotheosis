<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This is weird. Since members of the top seven noble clans have come here, it is impossible that the Valley would be guarded by only two people from the Yu Clan. Where are the other people? Does the Dragon Valley have another passage?" Luo Luo Zheng frowned and looked around. At the same time, he walked around the valley.</p>

  <p>At last, Luo Luo Zheng discovered many footprints on the ground of the valley. He raised his head and looked ahead. There was no passage in front. All Luo Luo Zheng saw was three bamboos growing along the valley wall.</p>

  <p>It was strange that these footprints led to the three bamboos.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned and studied the three bamboos. The main root of each was as wide as the mouth of a bowl. Considering their size, these bamboos had been growing for many years. However, the bamboo in the middle was cut, and only half was left. When Luo Luo Zheng observed the middle bamboo, he realized that it had been cut recently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought for a while and then reached out to touch the broken bamboo.</p>

  <p>A frown appeared on Luo Zheng's face. After touching the bamboo, he discovered that the broken bamboo was a virtual shadow.</p>

  <p>"Magic array!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng realized that a magic array had been placed here. On further thought, Luo Luo Zheng figured that he could enter the array by cutting the bamboo.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bamboo Leaf Sect had settled in the forest many years ago, and yet they had not discovered the array. Perhaps the entrance remained a secret as nobody had tried to cut the bamboo in the middle.</p>

  <p>It became obvious to Luo Luo Zheng that perhaps members of the top seven noble clans had cut the bamboo, started the magic array, and opened the entrance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng prepared to enter the array. However, a thought stopped him. After a little hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng pulled out a mask from the ring. He didn't fear members of the top seven noble clans, but he used the mask to avoid unnecessary trouble. After he left C County, Luo Luo Zheng realized the importance of family background.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long ago that Luo Luo Zheng had offended Chad. Ever since that incident, many members of the Zhuge Clan had made it their mission to target Luo Luo Zheng. It could be imagined that Zhuge Clan would continue to bring him trouble from time to time.</p>

  <p>Using a mask would hence, avoid such incidents.</p>

  <p>After wearing the mask, Luo Luo Zheng followed the footprints into the array.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not unfamiliar with magic arrays. When entering Cloud Sect, he had experienced the magic array on the Bloody Mountain.</p>

  <p>When he crossed the three bamboos, Luo Luo Zheng felt that the sky and earth were spinning. When everything settled, the scene before his eyes was different. There seemed to be a weird space behind the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had been prepared, he still felt stunned.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng's eyes stood a boundless forest. When seeing from a distance, he couldn't notice the difference. However, when he moved closer, every tree in the forest was over a hundred times bigger than that he had seen.</p>

  <p>Even the grass in the forest grew to abnormal heights. The grass towered over Luo Luo Zheng as though it were trees. Luo Luo Zheng stood under their stumps and felt as tiny as an ant. Standing on the stump, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that it extended dozens of feet in both directions. He couldn't see the whole tree!</p>

  <p>"Is this really a magic array?" Luo Luo Zheng had doubts. If this were not a magic array, where was he? Where in the world would one find such huge plants?</p>

  <p>No matter where it was, Luo Luo Zheng was sure that he was no longer in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>What surprised Luo Luo Zheng more was that there was a huge pink enchanted barrier in the sky, which covered a range of a hundred miles. This enchanted barrier was probably thousands of feet high and hundreds of miles long. Luo Luo Zheng wondered what level of power a person must have to be able to make such a considerable sized enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The edge of the pink enchanted barrier closest to Luo Luo Zheng was behind the entrance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng approached the pink enchanted barrier slowly. As he neared, Luo Luo Zheng felt it emit terrifying energy.</p>

  <p>"The energy of the Emerald Crystal claims to be able to break any enchanted barrier. Will it be effective against this pink one?" Luo Luo Zheng was curious.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng felt that the energy spreading from the pink enchanted barrier was extremely dangerous., he stayed at a safe distance from the enchantment. Then he released the energy of the Emerald Crystal on his arm, which extended to the enchantment cautiously.</p>

  <p>When the energy of the Emerald Crystal touched the pink enchantment, a tiny bolt of lightning shot out from the enchantment.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The lightning swallowed the energy of the Emerald Crystal in an instant.</p>

  <p>The tiny lightning looked ordinary, but it still frightened Luo Luo Zheng as he could see that he would die if hit by the lightning. In fact, his whole body would be consumed by the lightning, and there would be nothing left to bury!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gulped at the thought. Till now, he hadn't come across a person who could overwhelm him to this extent.</p>

  <p>Besides, the pink enchantment wasn't alive. Despite the fact that it spread over a great distance, the enchantment still maintained a lot of power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered if a legendary celestial being had made the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to try his demonic life energy at the beginning, but now he decided against the thought. It appeared that the enchantment wouldn't attack people. And so he chose not to provoke it. After all, if the lightning did strike him, Luo Luo Zheng would suffer a painful death.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng prepared to leave the edge of the enchantment, a creature appeared from outside the enchantment.</p>

  <p>It was a tiger. A white tiger!</p>

  <p>Had it been an ordinary tiger, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be afraid. Not even if there had been thousands of them. But this white tiger was different.</p>

  <p>This tiger was hundreds of feet tall. Standing before it, Luo Luo Zheng felt as tiny as an ant.</p>
