  <p>
</p>

  <p>Aside from the Nihility Spirit being actually strong, the red ball that was wrapped around their body was also extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>However, that ray of light which possessed an immense penetrating power, had actually pierced through it without any problems!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Once the ray of light punctured the red ball, the red ball broke like a water tank and its shattered pieces flew in all directions.</p>

  <p>Bright red blood gushed out next, and inside the red ball floated a strangely shaped skeleton. The skeleton clearly was not in the human form.</p>

  <p>"Jazlene!" the human woman screamed.</p>

  <p>She was utterly shocked when she saw that her companion was killed so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Based from what the statue said, Luo Zheng understood that only humans were allowed to enter the temple. In addition, the statue was highly goal-oriented and clearly knew its targets. At first it killed No. 12, and then No. 13, and finally that Nihility Spirit.</p>

  <p>As for this human woman, she was probably related to the human race.</p>

  <p>Specifically, she was most likely a member of the Snake Goddess race, so the statue did not attack her.</p>

  <p>Despite that, she remained frozen at her spot and didn't dare to move at all.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng and Feng Ge were stunned when the statue's fingers released those rays of light. They thought that the statue that stood in the middle of the hall was a real one made of stone. How could it be a sentient being with such great power?</p>

  <p>The stone statue raised its head to look at Luo Zheng, Feng Ge, and the human woman. "I thought it was the inheritors of the thirty-nine heroes who came, but I didn't expect that none of you are any of them," the statue said in an aloof voice.</p>

  <p>At the words "thirty-nine heroes," the human woman's vision darkened slightly, while Feng Ge was confused, and Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had counted all the statues and there were exactly thirty-nine of them.</p>

  <p>"Master!" he exclaimed. Then, he quickly cupped his hands towards the statue.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me master," the statue shook its head. "I'm just a soul puppet who can only follow the orders of my former master," he added.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, such a puppet only had a small memory of its former master. In addition, it was considered inferior to a soul fragment like No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Its eyes stared at the human woman as it continued, "That is why even I know that she is a traitor, I can't do anything to her."</p>

  <p>The human woman had been very nervous. She originally came from the human race, but she betrayed them and joined the Nihility race. Naturally, she was afraid that the statue would eliminate her. When she heard the statue's words just now, she immediately sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>"She has a human body but a tail of a snake. Can she even be considered a human?" Feng Ge huffed. She was not convinced.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the Snake Goddess race in the Li Shan mountain were not humans, but they were closely related to the human race. Furthermore, there was a considerable number of humans who lived in the Li Shan mountain, including the Human Sovereign, Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were still considered a human force most of the time.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess has the same origin as humans, so of course she could be considered a human," the statue said calmly.</p>

  <p>After the statue was finished, Luo Zheng continued to ask, "Are the thirty-nine heroes you mentioned the masters of the thirty-nine statues in this hall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the statue nodded. "Are they still alive on the Other Shore?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>He had previously promised King Manard that he would help him search for the human race on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In theory, the Other Shore human race should exist on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After all, they were the one who had spread the seeds of the human race in the present chaotic era.</p>

  <p>"Of course they are," the statue answered confidently as it eyed the human woman, then added, "Your Nihility race have been looking for them for a long time. Unfortunately, you haven't found anything so far, right?"</p>

  <p>The human woman remained silent.</p>

  <p>Ever since she had joined the Nihility race, she had chosen a path that she was completely uncertain of.</p>

  <p>In any case, there was no right or wrong when it came to choosing among the Purge Way, the Finale Way, and the Nihility Way.</p>

  <p>It was just that different people chose different ways to follow in order to pursue the goal they wanted to achieve.</p>

  <p>She had her own pursuit, and that was why she stood on the opposite side of the human race in the end.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me where they are now?" Luo Zheng asked again. This time, the human woman said, "Of course, they remain hidden on Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>How can they have a foothold elsewhere? The metal spirits, wood spirits, water spirits, fire spirits and earth spirits would never let the human race have an easy life."</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race was known as the most powerful civilization on the Other Shore. They opposed the human race and even many other civilizations. Most civilizations hid on the Other Shore. What happened after they had climbed up and reached the Stage Thirty-three was either they chose to endure, or to submit.</p>

  <p>"Although the Element Spirit Civilization is powerful, how can it be that strong? There are still other powerful civilizations on the upper stages," Luo Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Even if the Element Spirit Civilization was the strongest civilization on the Other Shore, there were over a thousand other ruling civilizations, large or small, that existed in the same place as them. Besides, although some civilizations had disappeared or hidden like the Green Jade Civilization, they wouldn't possibly let the Element Spirit Civilization monopolize the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>According to the information the Green Jade Spirit had given, all of the ten great civilizations were exceptional.</p>

  <p>A small smile graced the human woman's face, as if she meant to mock Luo Zheng's ignorance. "What you just said was the situation a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Indeed, that was the case hundreds of chaotic eras ago--but now, there are only a few forces that can contend against them. And we, the Nihility race, are one of them. You can consider joining us," she suggested.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had killed a Moon Fire Slave, she was very impressed and that aroused her interest in him.</p>

  <p>"There are only a few that can contend against them..." Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his gaze froze.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the other civilizations are either forced to join the Blood Assembly, or have completely disappeared from the Other Shore," the human woman said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Civilization had hidden on Stage Thirteen for a long time, and the situation on the upper stages of the Other Shore had undergone drastic changes within the span of these hundreds of chaotic eras. Thus, the real situation now was plainly different from what Luo Zheng had known.</p>

  <p>The current Element Spirit race was even stronger than what Luo Zheng and the Green Jade Spirit had imagined.</p>

  <p>In the same way, the power of the Nihility race was no longer what it used to be. It had become one of the few big races that could fight against the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The statue just listened nonchalantly to the conversation between the human woman and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once the human woman was finished speaking, it said, "Of course I know of the heroes' whereabouts, but if you want to know, I will tell you when you pass through there."</p>

  <p>Then, it pointed towards the ground not far away.</p>

  <p>A starry pattern appeared on the ground. There was a faint space fluctuation in the pattern, as if it was another world. "Is this a test?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the statue said with a smile. "The human race had built the Creation Myth Temple with all their might and resources. Those who have betrayed our race may not be able to pass the test so easily," it explained.</p>

  <p>Up until now, Luo Zheng didn't know why the human race had hidden the Other Shore Key in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, but they might have their own plans.</p>

  <p>It would be too simple and laid-back if the temple recognized any human who appeared in this place.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he wasn't surprised that there would be a test.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>He obviously wasn't afraid of the test the Creation Myth Temple had given.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Feng Ge followed him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the woman from the Nihility race only looked at the starry pattern not far away, her eyes filled with doubt.</p>

  <p>She wasn't sure if the statue said that to threaten her or just to frighten her. It was easy for her to enter recklessly, but if she wanted to leave safely, perhaps it wouldn't be that easy.</p>
