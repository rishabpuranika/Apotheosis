<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Chaim laughed lightheartedly as he realized their delicate identities. Then he said, "They are all human beings. It really doesn't matter where they come from."</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people, including Hutton, who stopped in their tracks, felt thoroughly relieved.</p>

  <p>The entire basement had now been fully restored. There wasn't even a single indication of the previous mess. It seemed like nothing happened.</p>

  <p>"Squeak... Squeak! Squeak..."</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak..."</p>

  <p>They heard squeaking noises from the corner of the wall while they walked along the passageway.</p>

  <p>"What do you think that was?"</p>

  <p>"They're mouse-shaped souls?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed. They do appear like the souls of the Ear Mice! They look so weak and fragile!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace looked at the souls. A curious look registered upon their faces.</p>

  <p>Those who entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore were probably either Indigo Souls or Souls of Light that were about to become Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>However, the souls at the corner were almost invisible. They seemed like candles in the wind that would go out at any time!</p>

  <p>The souls were back in their fundamental form. It was probably difficult for them to leave their bodies, let alone cross the Sea of Truth to reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"I think they really are... the souls of the Ear Mice," Zheng murmured while staring at the faint souls.</p>

  <p>Hutton nodded in agreement. He said, "They have been reverted to their initial form because of the hourglass."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had found the basement behind the Grand Sky Temple even without any clue. It was highly likely that they had big plans for the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>And for this mission, they had been prepared and had carefully worked out a plan.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they did an excellent job. They invited Zheng to come with them and he had successfully broken the wall down by force.</p>

  <p>However, they were not fully aware that breaking the wall would come at a great price.</p>

  <p>When the two armors appeared, even Zheng wasn't able to stop them. But then, the Ear Mice made a seemingly smart decision. They hid in a corner of the wall using a soul weapon.</p>

  <p>The way in which they hid was extremely brilliant. The two armors, the Souls of Light of alien races, and even Zheng did not notice them in the chaos that ensued.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Ear Mice didn't expect that everything would be restored in the basement after the armors left!</p>

  <p>As the fog rose slowly, the Ear Mice immediately noticed that something was terribly wrong. However, it was now impossible for them to escape.</p>

  <p>The passageway leading to the entrance was gradually restored. The Ear Mice were restored by the fog as well. Eventually, they became what they were now.</p>

  <p>These Ear Mice's Souls of Light only had their most rudimentary consciousness now. When they saw Chaim coming over, they squeaked and crowded round him. Even in the basement, they could not withstand the aura of the Other Shore and trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>Sally blinked, took out a soul pill, and gently crushed it. The powder of the soul pill released a trace of brown soul force.</p>

  <p>The little Ear Mice had instinctively believed that the soul force was their food. But as soon as they came forward to get it, Hutton rushed over and dispersed the soul force.</p>

  <p>"Brother, what are you..." Sally was taken aback. She didn't understand what Hutton was trying to do.</p>

  <p>"The force of soul pill can make them feel better," Dorothy muttered in agreement with Sally.</p>

  <p>Nearby, Feng Ge smiled coldly and said, "The Souls of Light of the Ear Mice are almost like newborn babies. You can try feeding soul pills to a baby and see if it can take it."</p>

  <p>Chaim bowed his head in agreement, "Princess Feng Ge is right. Soul pills will only accelerate their death."</p>

  <p>"But look at them, they seem so pathetic!" Sally commented while she shook her head.</p>

  <p>Although the Ear Mice looked ugly and disgusting in their adult forms, these small Ear Mice's souls were fairly cute. They even rubbed themselves against their feet.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, kindly put them into the Sumeru Space," Zheng finally said.</p>

  <p>He believed that these souls could cultivate again. Given enough time, these Ear Mice might still be able to recover as long as their race had kept their Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>In any case, Zheng was brought here by the Ear Mice. If he had even the slightest chance of saving them, he definitely wouldn't just abandon them.</p>

  <p>"Understood." Dorothy bowed her head in reply. Almost instantly, a blue square appeared on the tip of her finger. She pointed towards the direction of the Ear Mice's souls. "Squeak! Squeak..."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had no idea what was going on. But all of a sudden, they were drawn into the space ring.</p>

  <p>The space ring on the Other Shore was also regarded as a space in which severe auras could be avoided. As for how they would move these weak souls out of the Other Shore, it now depended upon the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>After the Ear Mice settled down in the space ring, Hutton walked towards the huge and strangely shaped stones on the side of the basement.</p>

  <p>The row of stones were almost entirely smooth except for a few defective round holes on their surface.</p>

  <p>Zheng examined the stones closely. However, he was quite puzzled. He had no idea what purpose they served.</p>

  <p>Hutton walked slowly along the stones from left to right. Then, he stopped in front of the seventh one. He took out three pieces of jade of different colors from his pocket.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the three pieces of jade, Zheng's eyes shone with sudden comprehension.</p>

  <p>These pieces of jade fit perfectly into the round holes of the stone!</p>

  <p>After observing for a while, Hutton put the cyan jade into the round hole on the top.</p>

  <p>He gently pushed the jade into the hole and a crisp sound rang. There seemed to be a mechanical device in the basement causing a vibration.</p>

  <p>Everyone raised their heads and looked around. However, they didn't notice any changes.</p>

  <p>Without pausing, Hutton then put the red and purple jades into the two round holes on the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>After they heard two crisp sounds again, the entire basement trembled with a thundering sound.</p>

  <p>The patterns on the other side of the wall began to change. The connected patterns started to move to two sides and then separately connected with the two armors. They formed two distinct circles.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the wall slowly began to move. Meanwhile, the passageway that led towards the outside also opened.</p>

  <p>The movement of the wall didn't break the integrity of those patterns. The chains wrapping the two armors didn't break either. They were still standing motionlessly on the platforms.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! It worked!"</p>

  <p>"Finally, we can get out of here!"</p>

  <p>"The clues are completely right!"</p>

  <p>A smile crept across the Nine Li people's faces.</p>

  <p>Before they entered the Grand Sky Temple, they were very nervous. But now that they had moved the wall, they became quite excited.</p>

  <p>Zheng went out and walked around. His eyes fell upon the two armors. After he got another look at the patterns on the wall, he suddenly became enlightened. The mechanical device was designed to prevent someone from forcefully smashing down the wall!</p>

  <p>"Are these armors really that powerful?" the disciples asked a bit skeptically.</p>

  <p>"About a thousand Souls of Light of alien races were slaughtered. Tsk, tsk..."</p>

  <p>"If only I could take the armor as my Other Shore Token," someone remarked regrettably.</p>

  <p>A few disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace reached out their hands and tried to touch the armors. Chaim hurriedly warned them, "Don't just touch them randomly. If they come to life again, I doubt that any of you will survive!"</p>

  <p>Those disciples quickly withdrew their hands as if they had been burned.</p>

  <p>After these warriors passed by the two armors, they saw a wooden bridge ahead. The bridge was long and narrow. It seemed like it would only fit two people. It also extended all the way forward into the vast distance. They could vaguely see the three wooden huts in the darkness.</p>

  <p>It was a little strange that there was no change in the wooden huts they saw in front of the temple and at the back of it. They should have been near the huts now, yet the huts still hung gloomily in the distant Dark Region.</p>
