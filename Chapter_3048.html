  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng came out of the small door, the disciples who had been waiting outside the Dragon City quickly surrounded him.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," Luo Zheng said gently.</p>

  <p>At once, he led the disciples to the open space just outside of the Dragon City. The disciples felt confused but followed him anyway.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around until he found the perfect place. As he settled, he tried to insert the flagpole into the ground.</p>

  <p>As he did this, he felt a strong repulsive force coming from the ground. Luo Zheng was not able to resist it at all, causing the flagpole in his hand to bounce away. The impact was so huge that he was thrown into the air. Soon after, he landed heavily on the ground with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>"Now that's powerful!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, shocked.</p>

  <p>Despite the flat area, Luo Zheng was unable to insert the flagpole into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, what an ignorant bloke! How dare you try and insert the flagpole into the ground near the Dragon City! How could a mere Flag Master like you take a share in this land?" An arrogant voice suddenly echoed from the distance.</p>

  <p>When the disciples heard the laughter, they all glared at the owner of the voice.</p>

  <p>The voice belonged to a Flag Master who carried a flagpole on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Based on where he came from, it was probable that he had just come out of the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Flag Master, Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask, "Excuse me, but why can't I insert my flagpole in the ground near the Dragon City?"</p>

  <p>"Well, theoretically, you can. But up until now, there is not a single Flag Master who is able to do so. Look, there is no one around here, right?" the Flag Master said as he pointed at his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng also became curious. He thought, 'Then why are there no flagpoles in this area if they have to be inserted in the ground before nightfall?'</p>

  <p>"The closer we get to the Dragon City, the more difficult it would be for us to plant our flagpoles in the ground. In fact, people at the Other Shore Realm can't do this. Now, do you understand how naive you sound? After all, It's getting dark, and you don't have much time left," said the Flag Master. He carried his flagpole and resumed flying forward and out of Luo Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng was instantly enlightened. It was such a shame that the old man did not tell him about an important piece of information such as that.</p>

  <p>But the Flag Master was right. If one was strong enough, then they would be able to insert the flagpole in the ground around the Dragon City. The truth of the matter was that Luo Zheng was not strong enough which led him to fail in doing so.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the sun was already setting and the sky was starting to get darker by the minute. Twilight was spreading slowly and evenly as it was already nightfall.</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng commanded the disciples and flew in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>After flying for roughly fifty miles, Luo Zheng looked down and noticed that there were so many flagpoles that stood not far away, flags swaying in the breeze.</p>

  <p>Looking more closely, he noticed that there was a faint circle of light that surrounded each of the flagpoles, covering an area.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he observed that each Flag Master had their followers gathered within this light circle. Sitting cross-legged, they awaited darkness to fall.</p>

  <p>However, the light circles were not of the same size. Some were big enough to cover about several miles, while others were relatively smaller which were only able to cover a dozen feet. But as these light circles were gathered, the space around this area seemed to be completely occupied.</p>

  <p>"Hey, look! There is an unoccupied space over there!" Beldene's sharp eyes did not disappoint them as he pointed at an open space.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng excitedly flew over as soon as he spotted the vacant space. But when he hovered above the area, a space wave exploded out of nowhere, revealing a figure before him.</p>

  <p>This figure held a flagpole in his hands. Taking a long and murderous look at Luo Zheng, he coldly shouted, "Fuck off, you stupid bloke! I got here first!"</p>

  <p>The man's Other Shore Realm aura suddenly burst out and forced Luo Zheng back.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he stabbed the flagpole that he was carrying into the ground. In no time, a ring of light enveloped the flag, indicating that the area had already been occupied.</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>"This guy is obviously overestimating himself. How dare he want to become a Flag Master! He hasn't even reached the Other Shore Realm yet."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I know this guy. He even offended Galen. It's clear that he's asking for death."</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the surrounding Flag Masters burst into laughter as they belittled Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, there's another one there," said Elgin, pointing at another vacant area.</p>

  <p>Right after hearing Elgin's notice, Luo Zheng immediately employed the Grand Teleportation and moved towards the spot. But before he was able to move to the vacant area, another Flag Master had already planted his flagpole in the area.</p>

  <p>Chuckling, the Flag Master mocked him and said, "Take a look around you, brat. There's no place for you to stay."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's face darkened in anger as he came to realize that these Flag Masters did this to him on purpose. How could they now allow him to occupy an area?</p>

  <p>Just then, men clad in white robes arrived. Carrying a smug smile on his face, Harden pointed at the heavily dark sky and said, "There's no one else who should be blamed for your stupidity but you. You brought this upon yourself. It's such a pity that you decided to become a Flag Master. Don't get your hopes up. You won't survive tonight."</p>

  <p>In the daytime, somebody was able to stop Galen from killing Luo Zheng. But once darkness fell, he and his followers could do whatever they wanted, and killing Luo Zheng was not against the rules.</p>

  <p>Galen was only one of the Flag Masters. But due to his prestige and reputation, he had conspired with many Flag Masters to turn against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Raising the flagpole in his hand, Luo Zheng sneered, "Very good! In that case, I won't insert the flagpole in the ground today. If you want to kill me, I won't back down. See for yourselves if I can survive tonight!"</p>

  <p>Harden was stunned to see Luo Zheng's overflowing confidence. With an evil smile, he replied, "Sure, I'm up for a challenge. Let's wait and see."</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng didn't come from a humble and simple background, but the rules outside the Dragon City had lasted for so many years. It was impossible for them to change the rules because of Luo Zheng alone.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng heard a woman's voice. Calmly, this voice told him,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, come over here. I can share some place with you."</p>

  <p>This woman was the female Flag Master who had tried to recruit Luo Zheng in the daytime.</p>

  <p>She had occupied an area that was over ten miles with thousands of people in her command.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master Monica, do you have to set yourself against Flag Master Galen?" Harden asked harshly as his face darkened.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Monica Yin came from a background that was not weaker than Galen's. With that being said, it would not be difficult for her to protect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to fight against Galen, but I still want to remind him that he can't afford to offend some people," Monica Yin retorted with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master Monica, I also want to remind you that you must pay a price for offending Flag Master Galen," Harden also threatened.</p>

  <p>But Monica Yin seemed to turn a deaf ear to the threat. Instead, she said in a soft voice, "Luo Zheng, no one is stopping you. Come here if you want to."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I won't insert the flagpole in the ground. I'm not afraid of them."</p>

  <p>Everyone was surprised to hear Luo Zheng's answer. Upon hearing this, Monica Yin frowned and seemed helpless.</p>

  <p>Thinking of another way to convince Luo Zheng, she came up to him and said,</p>

  <p>"Find your footing for the time being. Once you become strong enough, you can kill these bastards one by one and no one would even dare to say anything. Right now, it seems that you are making things more difficult than they already are by getting in trouble like this one."</p>

  <p>Coldly staring at her, Luo Zheng asked her back, "Did someone tell you anything?"</p>

  <p>The woman froze and was taken aback by this question. She sighed and said, "Please don't put me in a dilemma."</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters in the area who heard their conversation were astonished. In fact, Monica Yin had a very threatening reputation? she was a vigorous and ruthless Flag Master who had killed countless Flag Masters.</p>

  <p>They didn't understand why she was so nice to Luo Zheng.</p>
