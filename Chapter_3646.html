  <p>
</p>

  <p>The array was engraved with six fire-shaped seals emanating ferocious energy.</p>

  <p>Pearce recognized the seal on sight.</p>

  <p>"This is the Six-flame Array!"</p>

  <p>"It's extremely deadly!</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful!"</p>

  <p>Terror washed over the mountain leaders as the warning reached them.</p>

  <p>The array must be a sure killer if no less than Pearce was spooked.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Figures started to become visible within the array.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred people within the Six-flame Array, and most of them were Emperor Charm's royal guards. Though the Divine Lair was the main force of the Sun Crow race, these guards matched Elizabeth in strength and status.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth flapped her wings, positioning herself in the center of the array.</p>

  <p>Springer hovered beside her, beating his black wings. He glared at the Oneness Array. "You've forced our hand, so here we are," he called out menacingly.</p>

  <p>He turned to the Sun Crow race, booming out in a voice that reverberated in everyone's ears. "Destroy the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>At these words, the energy in the six fire-shaped seals burst out in six flames of different colors!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Canopy Flame!</p>

  <p>The World Exterminating Flame!</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Karma Flame!</p>

  <p>The six kinds of flames shot out simultaneously. They had all been created by Emperor Charm with the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. Each flame was stored in the seal and nurtured for tens of millions of years.</p>

  <p>When the flames emerged, they looked less like fire and more like six sharp sabers. As the Six-flame Array began to rotate, the six sabers slashed at the Sky Net!</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The entire Sky Net Array began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>The sight horrified the Oneness Generals of the twelve passes.</p>

  <p>"What kind of array is that?"</p>

  <p>"It's powerful enough to destroy anything!"</p>

  <p>"The Sky Net Array can't withstand it at all!"</p>

  <p>The Sky Net had been able to survive the fiery power of over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. But now, after only a few cuts from the Six-flame Array, it was about ready to collapse!</p>

  <p>Pearce, however, remained steadfast in his faith. "The power of the Six-flame Array is extraordinary, but the Sky Net Array is powerful, as well!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Sky Net began to glow fiercely no sooner had Pearce uttered these words.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net, which earlier appeared to be on the verge of collapse, had recovered to its original state in an instant! Its bright light turned into huge swords that slashed back at the Six-flame Array.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The shining swords sliced through the Six-flame Array. The colorful flames burst out in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Six-flame Array was extremely powerful, but it was not built for defense. It also began to shake as soon as it was cut.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth looked around at the unstable array, the panic mounting on her face. "It seems the Six-flame Array can't withstand the attack."</p>

  <p>Springer just sneered. "Don't worry. The Six-flame Array doesn't break that easily. Let's see who will last longer."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A pattern appeared beneath Springer's feet, emitting great energy. With a flash, the Six-flame Array stopped shaking and stabilized.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it appeared the battle would thus be decided on which array could last longer!</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors positioned in the various arrays of the seven mountains started to become uneasy.</p>

  <p>Whichever side gave in first would be put at a great disadvantage. It could even determine the victory of this war.</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the two great arrays continued to attack each other, the power they produced reached over 100, 000 divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Ripples in space began to spread because of the immense energy fluctuations.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the Other Shore Realm warriors of the twelve passes could only gape in awe at the sight.</p>

  <p>"What a horrible force!"</p>

  <p>"The impact might be powerful enough to crush everything it hits instantly into powder!"</p>

  <p>"We can't participate in a battle of this level!"</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes.</p>

  <p>When the battle had raged on for about an hour, a huge crack started to appear on the surface of the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>CRACK!</p>

  <p>The net started to fracture like a beautiful glass mosaic.</p>

  <p>Springer, Elizabeth and the others in the Six-flame Array felt a rush of triumph at the sight, but it didn't last long. Cracks also started to spread like fish scales on the surface of the six seals on the Six-flame Array.</p>

  <p>CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!</p>

  <p>The Six-flame Array began to collapse.</p>

  <p>"It can't stand the attacks anymore!"</p>

  <p>"I hope the Sky Net Array still manages to trap them!"</p>

  <p>Amid the hubbub, there were those who remained silent.</p>

  <p>These were the people at the bottom ranks. They detested the war. They knew they had very little chance of surviving. Even if their side won, the rewards that would trickle down to them likely wouldn't be worth all this risk!</p>

  <p>Pearce turned serious as he kept his eyes trained on what was happening to the great arrays. "Get ready, all of you. The victory or defeat of the Oneness Sky Palace depends on the next move!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The arrays of the seven mountains began to light up. Everyone was now on full alert.</p>

  <p>Zheng, too, concentrated his mind.</p>

  <p>The mouths of more than a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows began to glow with the blue light, ready to shoot flames.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>The Sky Net collapsed first.</p>

  <p>What began as a crack was now a full-on gap. The entire array began to dissipate, starting from the ruptured area.</p>

  <p>But as this happened, the six seals of the Six-flame Array also collapsed into a crystal clear powder.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was the first to react.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows emitted light beams from their mouths, straight at the center of the collapsing Six-flame Array.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors positioned in the Oneness Array started rising from the ground, pulling out the huge Lofty Swords they had been occupying.</p>

  <p>It came quite naturally to Pearce, Athemar and some of the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Libby, however, struggled a little with her Lofty Sword, her fair face betraying a hint of fatigue. She gritted her teeth and eventually managed to keep pace with the other masters.</p>

  <p>The Bright Array, the Golden Array, the Ivory Array, and all the other arrays also began to move. Everyone was ready to give their all in this battle.</p>

  <p>Just then, a purple light shot into the sky. It came from the Vastness Array.</p>

  <p>But instead of targeting the Six-flame Array, the purple light separated into six rays, turning into six huge purple swords. Each one hurtled straight for the other six arrays!</p>

  <p>A cold smirk played on Gethin's lips. He had chosen this critical moment to bring the rebellion out in the open.</p>

  <p>Gethin knew Pearce and the others had been on guard against him for a long time. It was too bad that they were too busy to be on the lookout now.</p>

  <p>It was a fatal mistake.</p>
