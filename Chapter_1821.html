<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1821 Determined (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As she grew up with her special token, there were many people who had died under her flame.</p>

  <p>The people in her clan viewed her token as an extremely powerful talent. However, to her, it was the fiend that she looked down upon as a curse. It saddened her when she found ordinary people trembling when they stood before her. Nobody dared to approach her, fearing that they would be burned to death if they weren't careful.</p>

  <p>A shudder went through the servants every time they had to serve her.</p>

  <p>The funny part was these servants had received special training. Yet somehow their fear of perishing became full-fledged when they faced her. Nobody could teach them to restrain their fear when facing the Princess Royal. After all, the fear of death was the most intense fear.</p>

  <p>Every unexpected movement from the Princess Royal prompted them to overreact. Some people might think of this as power, but that wasn't how the Princess Royal looked at it. Every time she sensed them jittering in front of her, she realized they treated her as a monster. She loathed nothing more than their stiff bodies. 'How I wish they would act with ease. I am facing a bunch of robots!' she would think with frustration.</p>

  <p>At the age of thirteen, she had burnt a playmate to death.</p>

  <p>Her own actions caused her endless grief. She felt akin to a hedgehog that could not hide its poisonous spikes. Her mere presence meant danger to others.</p>

  <p>This incident had cast a shadow on her heart, and it still weighed in her mind now.</p>

  <p>But the more powerful her blue flame was, the happier her brother would be. Even her own father looked at her power as a bliss.</p>

  <p>They had done quite a bit of research about this flame, but they had never uttered a word about it before her. They were well aware of her aversion towards her own power.</p>

  <p>However, after coming to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she was feeling better!</p>

  <p>Almost all the warriors in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had been accustomed to bloodshed. When she was with them, she wasn't looked at as an outcast. Their lives were full of killing and blood. There might be great danger to be around them, but such danger was nothing in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Of course, this also had something to do with the levels of the opponents she encountered after her cultivation and strength became stronger. After reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm, all of the martial artists she faced reacted very quickly, and if she wasn't able to control herself well enough when the blue flame erupted, others were able to avoid it easily.</p>

  <p>But the shadow in her heart had never completely dissipated. Every now and then she still thought about it. In theory, she didn't want to use the blue flame unless it was a life-and-death situation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Princess Royal had no intention of killing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Out of panic, the Princess Royal retreated continuously like a dragonfly that skimmed on the water's surface. But she still wasn't able to avoid Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't!"</p>

  <p>She screamed the moment Luo Luo Zheng threw himself at her.</p>

  <p>Seeing the look of panic on her face, Luo Luo Zheng found it a bit strange. However, her anxiety didn't stop him from moving towards her. With his strong hands, he grabbed the princess and pulled her into his arm. Without wasting any time, he rushed forward!</p>

  <p>The warriors behind were all stunned by his move.</p>

  <p>They had seen people risking their life to fight, but they had never seen someone seek death like Luo Luo Zheng had done. 'Is he a fool?' they all wondered.</p>

  <p>None of the warriors could figure out what was going on in this fellow's mind.</p>

  <p>Their confusion was only temporary because they quickly discovered that this youth's token seemed to be beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>The flame from the Princess Royal' body quickly spread across Luo Zheng's body, and in an instant, the two of them turned into a huge fireball, burning fiercely in the air!</p>

  <p>Countless golden vortexes appeared on the surface of Luo Zheng's body, rapidly absorbing the princess' flame.</p>

  <p>Years ago, her childhood friend was burned to death in this same manner.</p>

  <p>This dreadful memory once again flashed across her eyes. Her mind replayed the scene where she watched in despair as her playmate was being burned. She held onto her friend tightly, only to find nothing but ashes in her hands.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the princess dreaded that the same thing would repeat all over again.</p>

  <p>However, when she raised her head to look at Luo Luo Zheng, she saw that his sturdy body was absorbing her flame continuously. This man, it turned out, was not afraid of her flame!</p>

  <p>"That prophecy... is true?" The Princess Royal' head throbbed incessantly.</p>

  <p>Every time when night fell, she still chose to leave the Timeless Town.</p>

  <p>Her goal was to find the warrior that was teleported into this world and had landed on the Glitter Gold Gobi!</p>

  <p>A few days ago, a member from the Celestial Soul race came to the Timeless Town, but he was selling Falling Crystal Flowers in the town.</p>

  <p>The origin of the Celestial Soul was a mystery. They were ubiquitous in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but they were not the aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Moreover, they did not seem to come from the various universes, and there was no such race in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Some people took them for the Soul Race, but they were fundamentally different from each other!</p>

  <p>Now it turned out that the information provided to her by the Celestial Soul person was right. A creature had indeed appeared on the Glitter Gold Gobi, and this creature was capable of taking her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff!</p>

  <p>However, except for the princess, no one else believed this.</p>

  <p>At this moment, she felt elated for having had faith in this information.</p>

  <p>She had chosen to take a risk and now it had come to fruition. 'I have finally found him! He is right in front of me!' she thought delightfully.</p>

  <p>In spite of her happiness, there was a part that was still unsure if this person could truly take her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff. However, upon discovering that this young man could actually resist her blue flame, she was eighty percent sure that this man was the person she was looking for!</p>
