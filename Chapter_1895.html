<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After entering Luo Zheng's inner world, the cold flame poison started to fall gently like snowflakes.</p>

  <p>As these snowflakes fell onto the brown chaotic sea, they released chilly air, and it looked like the chaotic sea was going to freeze over...</p>

  <p>But nothing of the sort happened. Instead, the chilly air was instantly devoured by the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had endowed chaotic energy with the ability to devour other things, it could transform almost anything. He clearly knew that the chaotic energy was a formidable force.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Luo Zheng was primarily focused on refining his body. He could make use of the chaotic energy to display the Gods-intimidating Strike, but he usually unleashed the power of this strike by comprehending the Divine Dao. He did not exert the chaotic energy to its extreme. That was to say that Luo Luo Zheng was lacking a cultivation method, which could help him fully utilize the power of the chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>The cold flame poison was still falling down in soft waves in his inner world. The majority of the poison had disappeared into the chaotic sea, while a small portion had already fallen onto the main continent of his inner world. A few unlucky creatures might have come in contact with the poison and got instantly frozen into ice cubes. But the overall impact on his inner world was negligible.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could deal with the cold flame poison effortlessly, but it wasn't so easy for the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Although the Skyland race had distributed the Gold Sun Fruits, most of the martial artists present chose not to devour the fruit...</p>

  <p>According to the leader of the Skyland race, they were capable of comprehending the profound mystery of the Ice Law in the cold flame field.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the martial artists from the divine land were even more clear than Kaydan that the so-called profound mystery of the Ice Law was the famed skill of the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Ice Soul Flame was renowned in the divine land 30, 000 years ago!</p>

  <p>This flame was a unique profound mystery created by the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. And he was the first to unravel this mystery!</p>

  <p>When the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land became a Holy Being, he constructed a Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. He then made an announcement that everyone could cultivate in that land.</p>

  <p>Warriors could also absorb his strength source. This was a very exciting development for everyone in the divine land.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, his knowledge of the Ice Soul Flame was sealed within the cold flame field of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, thereby effectively shielding it from the outside world.</p>

  <p>In so many years, several warriors had entered this cold flame field, but none of them were able to comprehend the mystery of the Ice Soul Flame...</p>

  <p>For many martial artists from other races as well as those from the divine land, this was indeed a golden opportunity to finally comprehend the profound mystery.</p>

  <p>The Gold Sun Fruit could resist the cold flame poison, but they would only use it when they could not hold on any longer.</p>

  <p>Most warriors, including Luo Luo Zheng, were facing the same predicament. The cold flame poison lingered around their bodies and followed the meridians in their bodies to invade their inner worlds. Soon it began to snow within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>However, their inner worlds could not be compared with Luo Zheng's. The cold flame poison might be overbearing, but in the end it was only formed from life vitality, and the chaotic energy overpowered it.</p>

  <p>The temperature in the inner worlds of these martial artists began to plummet slowly.</p>

  <p>The inner worlds of the Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, especially those at the top level of the Spirit Transformation Realm, were already perfect. Some martial artists' inner worlds already had fourth-grade and fifth-grade sects, which were guarded by the Internal Elixir Realm martial artists and even Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>As the temperature plummeted, the creatures were in great danger. The snow formed by the cold flame poison resulted in an extremely low temperature, causing the warriors' inner worlds to be trapped in a frozen land. Layers of solid ice formed on the life vitality sea of some martial artists, bringing about devastating damage to the living beings within the inner worlds.</p>

  <p>The secondary creatures, which survived in the warriors' inner worlds, were unable to control their own destinies. It was possible that when they came into this world as infants, they would freeze to death in the harsh winter, or when they just became nature creatures, they might get infected by cold flames and freeze to death in an instant!</p>

  <p>This was not only happening among the secondary creatures but also in the universes created by the Holy Beings. If the Holy Beings were to fight, even the solid universes would be affected and suffer an earth-shattering extinction.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, the duration of a grand era was 3.6 billion years, and the end of each grand era was accompanied by a calamity that brought about extinction of the species. This kind of extinction was not caused by the battle between Mike and the others, but by something else.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords in the universe had come up with a rule, which was contrary to the reality of the situation, and they had even tried to enforce this rule to avoid the extinction of the universe...</p>

  <p>This was the plight of the secondary creatures. They could not completely grasp their fates and even their vision was limited. Even the Supreme Lords would not be able to control their own future, as they were also secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>The living beings in the inner world who were destroyed by the cold flame poison, probably thought that this calamity was brought about by the wrath of the Gods. Thus they all knelt down to pray, hoping to appease the angry Gods. They did not know that this catastrophe had occurred only because the inner world's owner wanted to undergo training.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>The glacial wind of the cold flame field blew fiercely.</p>

  <p>When this happened, everyone's bodies immediately shone with light.</p>

  <p>This was because the cold flames enveloping their bodies were blue and bright. They looked as if they were covered in sparkling jewelry, which gave them a beautiful appearance. At the same time, the amount of cold flame poison in their bodies greatly increased...</p>

  <p>This process was quite painful. The cold moved from the outside to the warrior's inner world, and after ravaging the inner world, it moved back outside. It was bone-chilling cold.</p>

  <p>Due to this process, the cold flame poison in the inner world had left the mark of rule there.</p>

  <p>In these past few years, no one had comprehended the profound mystery of the Ice Soul Flame completely, but this cold flame poison had indeed brought many benefits to the warriors, the least of which was a rapid improvement in the speed at which the Ice Law in everyone's inner world was perfected. After one cultivated to the higher level, they needed to use the laws they had comprehended to construct new laws within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Of course, this did not mean that people could endlessly keep absorbing the cold flame poison, as it could ultimately be fatal.</p>

  <p>Some of the weaker martial artists looked pale. When an icy wind blew, they couldn't help but curl up.</p>

  <p>"If you can't withstand the pressure, don't be stubborn about holding on!</p>

  <p>You will be able to resist it after eating the Gold Sun Fruit!" someone from the Skyland race reminded everyone.</p>

  <p>The warriors couldn't stand it any longer and finally gorged the Gold Sun Fruit! After entering the warriors' bodies, the Gold Sun Fruit quickly made its way into every inner world and turned into a golden sun, releasing a thermal current that warmed everything. Those who were battling life and death were naturally saved at the last moment. The inner world survived the crisis and became a vibrant place again.</p>

  <p>This warm current spread from the inside to the outside, melting away the cold from their meridians. Thanks to this life-infusing warm current, a healthy rosy color returned on the warriors' faces.</p>

  <p>But there were still many martial artists who were trying their level best to resist the discomfort and hold on!</p>

  <p>Among them, Aleyna was the most relaxed, as she could deal with the cold flame poison effortlessly.</p>

  <p>She was wearing a fire gown, so the cold flame poison could not enter her body. She was curious about the reaction of the crowd, and couldn't help but laugh when she saw the cold flames that flickered on the faces, hair and beards of Luo Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>Everyone continued to fly at a low altitude and they were not slow either.</p>

  <p>After travelling for four hours, they had crossed a distance of over a hundred thousand miles.</p>

  <p>The difference in the level of strength of the warriors could be ascertained during the journey of one hundred thousand miles.</p>

  <p>When they traveled ten thousand miles, only a few of the weaker martial artists had consumed the Gold Sun Fruit. When they reached thirty thousand miles, twenty percent of the group had swallowed the Gold Sun Fruit. When they reached seventy thousand miles, more than ninety percent of the martial artists had consumed the Gold Sun Fruit!</p>

  <p>Of all the martial artists present, only the Collapsing Mountain race's Divinity Hunt Squad members, the seven elders of the Skyland race, and a few elites of the Harmony race were able to reach one hundred thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng and Aleyna were among this group of achievers who made it as well.</p>

  <p>As for Han Liusu, if she were to use her abnormal flame, she would be able to resist the cold flame poison. However, those who specialized in using fire were even more afraid of the cold. So she had gobbled up the Gold Sun Fruit when she reached thirty thousand miles.</p>

  <p>"Chapman is right. Not only is Luo Luo Zheng capable of resisting the abnormal flame, he also seems to be able to withstand the extreme cold," Tilton, the leader of the Harmony race, remarked as he gazed at Luo Luo Zheng with a mix of admiration and surprise.</p>

  <p>He had come here with the members of the Harmony race, so he had naturally learned from Kaydan and Chapman that Luo Luo Zheng was a flame-proof warrior with special token. He also had never thought that the flame-proof warrior that the Collapsing Mountain warriors had mentioned a few months ago would increase his strength to this extent in such a short period of time...</p>

  <p>Initially, he had his doubts when he heard Kaydan and Chapman talk about Luo Zheng's impressive ability before, but now he was convinced that Luo Luo Zheng was indeed extremely powerful. At this moment, he saw that Luo Luo Zheng could also move freely in this world of ice and snow without needing to devour the Gold Sun Fruit. He indeed had remarkable abilities.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. You and I are able to withstand the cold flame poison when we reach a hundred thousand miles. Do you think that brat can withstand the cold flame poison after he travels one hundred and fifty thousand miles?"</p>

  <p>Kaydan asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>One hundred and fifty thousand miles...</p>

  <p>That was easily the deepest region of the cold flame field. Even the three leaders needed to devour the Gold Sun Fruit at that point.</p>
