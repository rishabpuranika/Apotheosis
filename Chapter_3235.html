<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Efrain was the first to rush over to where the huge Champion Fish were tangled together, knitted into a huge fish column. Zheng followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Milo was trapped in the middle of the column.</p>

  <p>"Burn!" Efrain shouted.</p>

  <p>A sizzling noise rent the air.</p>

  <p>Purple soul flame had begun to burn intensely.</p>

  <p>Efrain's soul flame was powerful. The huge Champion Fish had thick, rough skin, but under the soul flame's intensity, their twisting bodies were scorched black.</p>

  <p>Efrain removed the charred corpses of the fish from the outer layer. But there were still a lot of fish inside. No one knew how many layers of fish had wrapped themselves around Milo.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also working hard and trying his best to save Milo, but to no avail so far.</p>

  <p>Killing these fish was much more difficult than they had imagined. These were several times stronger than the smaller ones they had dealt with before.</p>

  <p>Even with his sharp Mind Sword, Zheng had managed to kill only six of them.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other, their hearts sinking. It looked like Milo was going to die this time.</p>

  <p>They needed to be careful of the Champion Fish sneaking up on them while they tried to save Milo. What was more, they had to be cautious of the creepy vines that sprang suddenly out of the ground.</p>

  <p>Seamus had, in fact, intended to finish off Zheng and the other four warriors who had come to attack him. He had sent only half the number of Champion Fish to attack the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. The other half kept gathering together, forming a huge circle.</p>

  <p>To Seamus, the guys who were rushing towards him were already dead.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly felt a chill emanating from the column that the Champion Fish had formed.</p>

  <p>Efrain was burning the Champion Fish with his soul flame. But it was extinguished the moment the chill began to spread outwards.</p>

  <p>"It's so cold!"</p>

  <p>This chill was a hundred times more horrifying than that of the Sea of Truth. Even Zheng and Efrain who had Indigo Souls had to beat a retreat.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish that formed the column wriggled madly, and only stopped moving when the chillness spread over them. It wasn't long before the entire column froze and became a solid, unmoving column.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Cracks began to appear on the surface of the column, and those huge Champion Fish broke as well.</p>

  <p>Seamus looked at the column, confused. He could not figure out the kind of method that was used to freeze the Champion Fish so instantly.</p>

  <p>Seamus's puzzlement lasted just a moment before the fish column broke and shattered. The Champion Fish and the vines that had trapped Milo turned into pieces. A blue sharp sword radiance shot towards Seamus.</p>

  <p>'This is the Mind Sword. But where did the chill come from?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>The Mind Sword was originally colorless and invisible. But the chillness it contained was so strong that its energy manifested itself so that it outlined the originally invisible Mind Sword in a tinge of light blue.</p>

  <p>Seamus hadn't expected this to happen!</p>

  <p>He was stunned at the sudden surge of sword radiance coming his way.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath before ducking out of the way in a bid to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance brushed past Seamus's arm. His arm went numb, losing all sense of touch. The chill managed to injure his soul.</p>

  <p>"Milo!"</p>

  <p>The moment he had launched the strike, Milo fell from the sky onto the frozen corpses of the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>Milo's soul was left incomplete from being trapped by the vines and bitten by the Champion Fish. His arms were gone, his torso ripped, and his soul had become badly damaged.</p>

  <p>But he was able to unleash a terrifyingly powerful strike even in this state.</p>

  <p>Efrain and the others who had witnessed it were impressed by the braveness of the act.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have time to check on Milo.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Milo must have paid a huge price to be able to perform that strike and freeze the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>But he missed his target and failed to kill Seamus.</p>

  <p>Zheng caught sight of Seamus fleeing. He wasn't about to let go of this opportunity. He followed Seamus.</p>

  <p>Seamus calmed down after a short period of panicking.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish obeyed his orders and this was his greatest advantage.</p>

  <p>As he spotted Zheng following him, he waved a hand and the Champion Fish rushed to create a barrier between him and Zheng. At the same time, a seed began to sprout from the ground under Zheng.</p>

  <p>Milo's situation had become desperate after having been wrapped up in the vines that grew from the seed. Zheng had learned his lesson from Milo and was on constant guard.</p>

  <p>The seed began to grow into vines and spread to Zheng. But his Mind Sword turned downwards and chopped at the vines, cutting them in half.</p>

  <p>Zheng was fast in his reactions but Seamus had already put quite some distance between himself and Zheng.</p>

  <p>The number of Champion Fish coming Zheng's way from all directions was increasing. They would surround him if he hesitated for even a moment.</p>

  <p>"I'll escape from the right!" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>He killed several Champion Fish before he found it was pointless to continue chasing Seamus. He escaped the encirclement from the right.</p>

  <p>But the moment Zheng found some breathing space, more Champion Fish emerged out of nowhere and began to chase him.</p>

  <p>"You want to kill me? Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Seamus yelled, turning his attention to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng fought the fish off as he withdrew. But he only managed to dodge the fish a few times before he was cornered.</p>

  <p>Behind him was the wall formed by smoke. There was no way out of here.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at the rapidly flapping wings of the Champion Fish, his jaw clenching. There were few tricks on the Other Shore that Zheng could use to retaliate and he had fallen into a dead end this time.</p>

  <p>He had never thought he would find himself in such a sticky situation when all he wanted was to watch a fight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>As the Champion Fish closed in on him, Zheng continued to control his Mind Sword and brought it down in continuous strikes. But the number of Champion Fish that were killed was too small when compared to the ones still making their way towards him.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was just about to give up when a sudden chill went through him.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>A sword mark could be seen on the smoke wall. It was the mark left by Milo's strike. Cold blue air rose around the mark.</p>

  <p>The strike that Milo had launched with all his strength hadn't hit Seamus.</p>

  <p>Instead, it brushed past his arm and had traveled several thousand feet to hit the wall.</p>

  <p>"The wall is frozen!" Zheng exclaimed, his eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how things worked on the Other Shore, but in reality, anything that was frozen would become crisp.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng was in a desperate situation, and as the idea crossed his mind, he rushed along the smoke wall and headed towards the sword mark on the wall.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Thousands of Champion Fish were still chasing Zheng, leaving hardly any space for Zheng to move.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A Champion Fish caught up with him and bit him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul force burst out at the immense pain.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>In a flash of white, three Mind Swords shot out simultaneously and circled around Zheng, killing a lot of Champion Fish and clearing some space for him.</p>

  <p>He continued along the space and finally closed in on the sword mark. His body ached from all the wounds that the Champion Fish had inflicted on him.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was finally relieved. Uncaring about everything else, he activated his Mind Sword to hit the wall.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The wall that had been tough before became so crisp that it cracked under Zheng's blow. A large round hole appeared on the wall.</p>
