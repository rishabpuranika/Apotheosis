<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From all the people that were inside the red circle, only three people would remain at the very end. None of them were willing to be pushed out, and many of them shared the same tactic -- eliminate the strongest one first!</p>

  <p>Every martial artist had already evaluated each of their opponents the moment they saw them. 'You look weaker than me? Alright, since you don't pose much of a threat to me, I won't bother to wipe you out myself.</p>

  <p>You will either be knocked out by others, or when there are only a few people left in the circle, I will deal with you then! In any case, you are weaker than me, and it is only a matter of time before I defeat you. Why should I bother to waste my energy and time on you?' That was a typical thought of many of the contestants in the red circle.</p>

  <p>Thus, everyone's goal from the very start wasn't to squeeze out the weakest, but the strongest!</p>

  <p>With such logic, who would be the first to be wiped out?</p>

  <p>Of course, it would be the fellow who looked the strongest! And it was exactly that arrogant guy who dared to occupy the most advantageous position inside the red circle!</p>

  <p>The moment he decided to take that center position, he already doomed himself to lose. The attack on him was instantaneous, and it was all his fault.</p>

  <p>It was out of instinct of survival that these martial artists chose to join hands against him.</p>

  <p>This test's main goal was not to pick the strongest among the fighting warriors. It aimed to see who was the best at making decisions, and maximizing his or her strength according to that. Being strong was a plus, but only if you played the game right, otherwise you would be under attack on all sides right from the start.</p>

  <p>Upon watching what was happening, Luo Zheng was able to realize why Jade Martial House organized such a test.</p>

  <p>A martial artist's overall strength didn't only include one's cultivation level and power. His or her real strength also had something to do with luck and wisdom. In many occasions, even if someone was the strongest warrior in the field, that person would be easily killed by the tricks played by the enemies. Unfortunately, the guy who was kicked out first had only strength, but no brain.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was not appropriate to say that he was completely brainless.</p>

  <p>After all, there weren't many martial artists who would be able to see the logic behind the fight's rules. If that were the case, wouldn't everyone be brainless?</p>

  <p>So in the end, the lesson that everyone should learn was -- arrogance, having too much of it, would only end up as a disadvantage to someone.</p>

  <p>One must keep a low profile if one wished to accomplish high profile jobs.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>After the first guy was out, the fighters left inside the red circle began to fight each other. The battle was chaotic.</p>

  <p>The mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm who had announced the rules had clarified that killing was forbidden in the red circle, so everyone restrained themselves as they attacked their fellow warriors. Fortunately, no casualties were caused, thanks to the fact that no one had used a weapon in the fight and everyone's main goal was to force each other out of the red circle, not to kill.</p>

  <p>Despite those clear rules, in a fight among martial artists, it was virtually impossible to avoid sustaining injuries. Some martial artists were knocked unconscious under the combined attacks of several people, and then they were kicked out of the red circle like rice sacks.</p>

  <p>This scuffle lasted for about five minutes. A huge lump of the warriors had been thrown out at the beginning of the competition-- some were directly thrown out, some were knocked out unconscious, and some timid ones had no choice but to leave the red circle due to the intensity of the fight.</p>

  <p>When only ten fighters remained inside the red circle, they started being more careful. Slowly, they moved around carefully planning out their attacks. They were looking for opportunities to push the others out of the red circle, and also to prevent themselves from being thrown out.</p>

  <p>The speed at which a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist moved was extremely fast. The ten figures were zooming back and forth, and their figures started to look more like shadows. However, from time to time, someone would be thrown out of the red circle.</p>

  <p>When there were only six martial artists left, the rate at which people were thrown out of the red circle slowed down. At this time, everyone was even more cautious! Among the six martial artists, three of them would be able to stay and win the round. So every one of them had half a chance of passing the test!</p>

  <p>A few of them were fighting, but some were not and were just looking for the most advantageous moment to attack.</p>

  <p>However, if these Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists did not fight, the Jade Martial House would have a way to make them fight! Suddenly, the red circle began to shrink!</p>

  <p>First, it trembled slightly and started to close up towards the center. The way it was narrowing was slow, so the warriors inside had the time to plan their next move.</p>

  <p>Despite the time that was being given to them, they couldn't help but panic. The fighting area was getting smaller and smaller, and they would have to make a move in the next moments!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The first martial artist who had lost his patience was the first to be thrown out of the red circle.</p>

  <p>Following that, two other warriors were also instantly driven out.....</p>

  <p>The battle had come to an end, and the remaining three martial artists became the victors of the first round.</p>
