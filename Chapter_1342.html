<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing how his brother had worked so hard and still only managed to obtain a third-rank divine weapon, Rhydian was a little disheartened.</p>

  <p>As Matteo got up from the ground, a look of unwillingness crept on his face.</p>

  <p>With their status, they held third-rank divine weapons in contempt.</p>

  <p>Matteo, now standing on the side, said furiously, "I underestimated the pressure of the dome! Rhydian, I want to try again!"</p>

  <p>The cost of trying again was three hundred life vitality jades, which equaled three million supreme life vitality crystals. To most warriors, this was a stupendous sum.</p>

  <p>Of course, to the warriors of the Mist Palace, it was not a small amount of savings either. Although it cost a lot of life vitality jades, since Matteo desired it, Rhydian reached into his pocket and took out three hundred life vitality jades, throwing them onto the white-eyebrowed elder's table.</p>

  <p>The elder smiled faintly. As the elder received the three hundred life vitality jades, Matteo once again leaped forward, flying toward the dome.</p>

  <p>In fact, with Matteo's strength, he could have easily grabbed a secondary second-rank divine weapon. But what he got his hands on was a third-rank one instead. He was unwilling to accept this fact and decided to have a try once again. Since he had lost a chance already, this time he wanted to do his best to obtain a divine weapon of a higher rank.</p>

  <p>His target was a secondary first-rank divine weapon...</p>

  <p>Now that he had such a wild ambition, he had to pay the corresponding price. His goal was to possess a secondary first-rank divine weapon, but in the end, he was hit by the giant pressure before being smashed onto the ground. He had managed to receive nothing once again.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing what happened, Rhydian frowned as well.</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors in the Weapon House, they sighed. Matteo had wasted three hundred life vitality jades just like that— for absolutely nothing in return. It was really a pity.</p>

  <p>This time, Matteo was too embarrassed to try again, so he stepped aside silently.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Rhydian took out four hundred life vitality jades and handed them over to the white-eyebrowed elder. He said, "Here are four hundred life vitality jades. Let me have a try this time!"</p>

  <p>'Four hundred life vitality jades?' Zheng thought, his eyes flashing with surprise. Just now they said the task only needed three hundred life vitality jades. Why was Rhydian paying one hundred more life vitality jades this time?</p>

  <p>However, the talk of the warriors around Zheng made him realize what was up.</p>

  <p>"Oh no. Rhydian is truly ambitious. He has his eyes on those first-rank divine weapons!"</p>

  <p>"Rhydian is very powerful. Now that he is a Soul Sea Realm warrior, he might be able to get his hands on one of them!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he wants to earn back what his brother has lost. But the pressure of the dome is adjusted as per the cultivation of the warriors. These first-rank divine weapons have been here for countless years, and only a few of them have been taken so far. I heard from an elder from Ice Cloud House that the most recent time the first-rank divine weapon was taken was a hundred years ago."</p>

  <p>A first-rank divine weapon?</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, all weapons Zheng had used could be considered top-grade weapons in the Central Region or the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, his weapons were not regarded as the best in the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The most important reason for it was that Zheng relied too much on his own body instead of the weapon in his hand, as his own body itself was a weapon. Now in the Upper World, Zheng had begun to understand the importance of a high-grade weapon.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Black Star was a supreme divine weapon, but it wasn't appropriate to show it to others in most occasions or make use of it to fight an enemy.</p>

  <p>'I should just observe for a while, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As the white-eyebrowed elder received the four hundred life vitality jades, the faint smile still lingered on his face. He stretched out his hand and a picture scroll appeared, with several kinds of magic weapons drawn on it.</p>

  <p>"One of the first-rank divine weapons in the Weapon House, the Blood Dripping Spear, was borrowed by a steward. Now there are sixteen first-rank divine weapons left. You can choose four of them and I will place them on the dome," the elder said.</p>

  <p>"I know the rules." Rhydian nodded as his gaze swept over the picture.</p>

  <p>He casually pointed at some weapons and picked out four from the sixteen first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Rhydian was a sword cultivator. The four weapons he chose were all first-rank divine swords— the Crimson Fire Sword, the Book Sword, the Heavenly Shadow Sword, and the Ten Directions Howling Sword respectively.</p>

  <p>After he had selected the weapons, the elder reached out and gently flicked his finger. Four red light dots entered the dome. They were extremely eye-catching amongst the white light dots. However, after floating for a while, the red light dots floated over to the highest point of the dome.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that these first-rank divine weapons were priceless items.</p>

  <p>It would not be easy to obtain them.</p>

  <p>Even the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, or those with higher cultivation levels, could not easily receive them, let alone a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>Many of the elders as well as the stewards of Mist Palace borrowed these weapons from the Weapon House when they needed to step out to fight.</p>

  <p>Once they returned, they had to hand back the weapons.</p>

  <p>However, placing the first-rank divine weapons here was only a form of encouragement. Very few warriors of Ice Cloud House and Swallow Cloud House were able to get them. Those who could do so were all very outstanding talents.</p>

  <p>Rhydian intended to accept the challenge. His brother had had a free opportunity just now and spent three hundred life vitality jades in addition, which was not a small expense for him. If Rhydian were able to obtain a first-rank divine weapon, he would gain profit.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, not only would he be able to obtain a treasure, he would also become quite popular at the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Under the gazes of the other warriors present, Rhydian walked to the center of the dome. He was not in a hurry to rush to the dome, but he had to make some preparations. First, he needed to swallow a pill which would make the life vitality sea within his inner world surge vigorously and increase his strength by at least twenty percent. This pill was worth thirty to forty life vitality jades, but he had already spent four hundred life vitality jades now, so he made use of this expensive pill without hesitation.</p>

  <p>After swallowing the pill, Rhydian took a deep breath and left the ground.</p>

  <p>He knew that there was a short period of delay as the downward pressure traveled down from the gravity dome. Although it was a brief period and only lasted for the blink of an eye, it would be a precious opportunity for him.</p>

  <p>The gravity of the dome could sense the strength of the warrior. As the warrior increased his strength, the gravity increased correspondingly.</p>

  <p>Hence, Rhydian slowly flew up. Even so, the surge of energy was still very powerful. As he rose higher and higher, the gravity that he felt grew stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Right now, many white light dots floated around Rhydian. Within the dots were various secondary third-rank divine weapons. Weapons of this level naturally did not attract his attention. He continued to move higher without once glancing at them.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, he reached the light dots that covered the second-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>The warriors inside Weapon House once again started to whisper to each other.</p>

  <p>"He has already reached the place where the second-rank divine weapons are placed. It would be great if he were to just grab a second-rank divine weapon at random!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. A second-rank divine weapon is not bad either. But since he has already handed over one hundred more life vitality jades, his target must be a first-rank divine weapon..."</p>

  <p>"It is tough to obtain a first-rank divine weapon. If he is unable to grab hold of it, I'm afraid he would leave empty-handed."</p>

  <p>At the moment, Rhydian's face was completely red. Under the great gravitational pressure, it was much harder to ascend even by an inch. But he still gritted his teeth and slowly moved upward. Facing the white lights floating around him, he could not be bothered to even glance at them.</p>

  <p>He only paid attention to the red light dots that contained the first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>As he slowly moved upward inch by inch, he passed the second-rank divine weapons and got to the area of the secondary first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>He was now less than ten feet away from the red lights. As he looked at the four red light dots floating in the air, his eyes flashed with a savage gleam.</p>
