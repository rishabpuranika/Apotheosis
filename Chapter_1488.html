<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1488 The Gathering Of Many Supreme Lords </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a giant hand grabbed at Maddox and Tanya. Even with their abilities, they couldn't escape it.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they were caught in the grip of the giant hand.</p>

  <p>Tanya's face darkened. Her machete and her body were tightly grasped in the huge hand. Slash unexpectedly released a circular light screen that continuously spread in an attempt to forcefully push the huge hand apart.</p>

  <p>Maddox also released his own power to try and break free from the giant hand.</p>

  <p>"May I ask who you are? We are from the Demon Night, and we are here to act on behalf of our queen!" As Maddox struggled, Tanya revealed their identity.</p>

  <p>At this, a sneer came from the sky. "So you're from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>You can scram now!"</p>

  <p>After that, the giant hand gently pinched the light screen that Tanya had created, causing it to shatter with a loud bang. Then, it suddenly swung forward and threw the two of them into the air.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord's strength was unimaginably great. With just a gentle toss, Maddox and Tanya began to roll in the air. In the blink of an eye, they flew tens of thousands of miles before slowly coming to a stop.</p>

  <p>The two of them exchanged glances, frowning. Although their strength was extraordinary among the world lords, it was still too insignificant in the face of a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The difference between a warrior that carried the Heavenly Destiny and a warrior that didn't was just too great. A warrior could only become a Supreme Lord if he or she possessed a Crown of Destiny and carried the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" Maddox asked.</p>

  <p>"Our queen and Supreme Lord Gunter must be rushing here at top speed right now! Even if this Supreme Lord snatched the Crown of Destiny, he wouldn't be able to take it away," Tanya said with a cold snort.</p>

  <p>It took a warrior a certain period of time to carry the Heavenly Destiny after he or she obtained a Crown of Destiny. Even if this Supreme Lord took away the Crown of Destiny and passed it on to a world lord beside him, that world lord wouldn't be able to carry the Heavenly Destiny in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, during the process of carrying the Heavenly Destiny, a warrior had to communicate with the heavens without moving even a single step.</p>

  <p>If this Supreme Lord obtained the Crown of Destiny and immediately fled, he might be able to run away. However, other Supreme Lords would chase after him.</p>

  <p>Every time a Crown of Destiny appeared, many great races would fight for it. Maddox and Tanya felt rather frustrated right now. If Yao had sent them to kill Luo Luo Zheng from the beginning instead of sending Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca, and Elspeth, they might have already taken the Crown of Destiny and returned to their place.</p>

  <p>But now, the small Immortal Mansion had flown quite far away and was heading straight for the nearest light yellow star.</p>

  <p>As the billowing black smoke dispersed, a tall and sturdy figure came into view. This guy was clad in black armor. His eyes were like bells, and his body was wide and broad. It was an impressive ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>As the ogre Supreme Lord looked at the small Immortal Mansion that was fleeing far away, his face revealed a faintly discernible sneer. The billowing black smoke once again enveloped his entire body, and he chased after the Immortal Mansion at an even faster speed.</p>

  <p>Standing inside the Immortal Mansion, Luo Luo Zheng watched the events in the outside world as the pale yellow star grew bigger and bigger in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Mountains, rivers, deserts...</p>

  <p>Every single detail on this star was clearly visible to Luo Luo Zheng. Ninety percent of the surface of this star was covered by sand, and there were no living beings on it.</p>

  <p>Some of the stars were home to living beings; even a few large stars were occupied by the races in the universe. There were also some extremely special minerals and resources on these stars that were impossible to find within the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The small Immortal Mansion charged straight toward the surface of this star. At Luo Zheng's request, it drilled into a desert.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had watched as the two Demon Night warriors had battled the giant black hand before being flung away. Although he didn't have to worry about the two Demon Night warriors anymore, he now had a bigger worry. Since the giant hand had been able to easily grab two world lords and casually fling them afar, it must mean that the owner of the giant hand was a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"I don't know which race you are from, brat, but all I want is the Crown of Destiny. If you hand it over, then you won't have to die!"</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was deep in thought, he heard the voice of the Supreme Lord resound through the Immortal Mansion. In the sky, a burly figure emerged from the black smoke, looking down at him like a giant god.</p>

  <p>With just a single glance from this Supreme Lord, Luo Zheng's heart began to beat wildly. It was as if there was a type of powerful energy contained within that gaze, and that was the supreme law under the heavens.</p>

  <p>'So he is a Supreme Lord. And not just any Supreme Lord, but an ogre Supreme Lord, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Although he had heard of Supreme Lords before, this was the first time that he had seen a Supreme Lord in person. The number of Supreme Lords in this universe was far too low.</p>

  <p>Moreover, nearly all the Supreme Lords cultivated in seclusion and seldom showed themselves. 'He wants the Crown of Destiny? How does he know I have it?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered with a frown.</p>

  <p>He knew that some of the stronger warriors in the universe had calculation abilities. Even Immortal Mist from the Lower World was proficient in Purple Star Astrology and was able to calculate a person's fate.</p>

  <p>But it was hard for Luo Luo Zheng to imagine that someone could be able to pinpoint the position of a tiny Crown of Destiny among 100, 000 supreme worlds in the vast universe. This was a bit inconceivable, as Supreme Lords weren't gods, nor were they an omniscient existence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng naturally did not know that the Crown of Destiny was originally connected to the heavens. His unintentional contact with the Crown of Destiny had alerted all the Supreme Lords in the universe.</p>

  <p>When the ogre Supreme Lord saw that the warrior in the mini Immortal Mansion did not respond, a sinister smile appeared on his face. The black smoke once again turned into a giant hand that enveloped the area below.</p>

  <p>However, just then, strange blue threads suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>These threads interweaved and formed a huge and dense net, blocking the view of the ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>When the ogre Supreme Lord saw the blue net, his eyes flashed with a cold light. He waved his giant hand in an attempt to break through the net.</p>

  <p>Under his control, the power of the massive hand suddenly increased by more than ten times. That blue net seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure; its threads broke off one after another, and the entire net was about to collapse. However, at this time, another blue net formed from threads appeared above the head of the ogre Supreme Lord, enveloping him.</p>

  <p>The ogre Supreme Lord noticed this net at the last minute and quickly withdrew his hand. His body flashed and turned into black smoke to avoid the net. "Luo Zhengia! You are simply courting death!" he said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>As the ogre Supreme Lord finished speaking, the blue threads intertwined and gradually formed a beautiful and exquisite figure in the air. In an instant, the threads turned into a young and beautiful human girl. With a slight smile on her face, she stared at the ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Addison. I'm just looking for the Crown of Destiny. There's no need to get so worked up." Supreme Lord Luo Zhengia had a frivolous smile on her face as she stared at the ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The ogre Supreme Lord was the famous Supreme Lord Addison. He was considered one of the oldest and most famous Supreme Lords in the universe, and his lifespan could also be considered one of the longest.</p>

  <p>'Another Supreme Lord...'</p>

  <p>Inside the Immortal Mansion, Luo Zheng's expression once again sank. The sudden appearance of two Supreme Lords was indeed beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>Even though he was extremely confident in this Immortal Mansion, facing two Supreme Lords was still hard to imagine.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, a ball of purple flames suddenly burst out. The flames seemed to contain the might to burn the heavens. At once, a flash of scorching heat spread, causing the entire desert to turn into a blazing hell. Then, a figure walked out of the flames. "I always thought I was fast, but I never thought that you two would be even faster! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"Another Supreme Lord!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed. His heart skipped a beat as a wry smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The allure of the Crown of Destiny was actually this great. In the blink of an eye, it had attracted three Supreme Lords. He didn't know if there would be more Supreme Lords to come.</p>

  <p>Just as this thought appeared in Luo Zheng's mind, a fourth Supreme Lord slowly appeared in the sky.</p>
