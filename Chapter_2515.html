  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of the Holy Beings, in the blink of an eye, Nicholas disappeared right before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Those present exchanged glances, none of them knowing what had just happened.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas was the one who gathered the Holy Beings to discuss some important matters.</p>

  <p>Why did he leave so suddenly?</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand miles to the east of the Time Sea was the Silverwing Divine City.</p>

  <p>Originally, it belonged to a second-tier clan in the divine land, but the Dongfang Clan forcibly expropriated it some divine eras ago.</p>

  <p>How could a second-tier clan dare to go against a powerful clan above the Time Sea like the Dongfang Clan? They were forced to keep their resentments to themselves to avoid damaging trouble.</p>

  <p>But the Dongfang Clan never attached much importance to the divine city. Although the Silverwing Divine City technically belonged to the Dongfang Clan, the city revenues still went straight to the second-tier clan.</p>

  <p>Soon, Nicholas' figure appeared within the borders of the city.</p>

  <p>But no one in the entire city knew of his existence? not even the city's no-fly ban had been triggered.</p>

  <p>In a flash, his figure entered a building in the Silverwing Divine City.</p>

  <p>A thin old man was in the building.</p>

  <p>He was bent over at the waist, sorting out some materials.</p>

  <p>"You old man? hurry up!" a mid-rank True God beside him berated.</p>

  <p>They were in a well-known pill-refining workshop in the Silverwing Divine City, where the old man had dedicated many divine eras working hard.</p>

  <p>Being too humble and honest of a worker, he was often bossed around by those around him.</p>

  <p>But he was always diligent and efficient, in addition to being knowledgeable and requiring minimal salary? the pill-refining workshop was naturally glad to have him as an employee.</p>

  <p>While many people treated him as someone insignificant, he had, in fact, long become indispensable.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Nicholas entered the workshop.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of the stranger was quite a surprise to the many True Gods there.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you break in here! This is an important venue of our Qian Clan, welcome only to important people."</p>

  <p>This Qian Clan was the second-tier clan in the Silverwing Divine City.</p>

  <p>Although the city was primarily under the Dongfang Clan, in actuality, it was mostly controlled by the Qian Clan.</p>

  <p>Because Nicholas hid his cultivation, the True Gods naturally didn't know who he was. And they certainly wouldn't be polite to a stranger who walked in unannounced.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas merely ignored them all and walked towards the old man who was sorting out the medicinal materials. There was much respect in his demeanor toward the old man as he asked, "Master Hamish, why did you summon me?"</p>

  <p>Anyone who knew Nicholas would've been shocked to see him speak to someone with this kind of reverence.</p>

  <p>He was the leader of many Holy Beings and was considered to be the strongest in the divine land, after all. No one had ever seen him be so respectful towards others.</p>

  <p>The old man didn't look up and continued letting his bony fingers move nimbly through a pile of herbs, picking out those of poor quality. In a low voice, he said, "I felt Lorena's existence. I know where she is now."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' voice trembled involuntarily as his eyes grew eager with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me? I'm talking to you! Who the hell are you? How dare you... " One of the mid-rank True Gods felt offended at Nicholas' dismissiveness? the stranger actually passed right by him just to talk to the old man.</p>

  <p>"So annoying!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' face darkened before he stretched out his hand and gave it a gentle wave.</p>

  <p>An invisible force engulfed the mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Before he could even finish his words, numerous cracks started appearing on the surface of his body like he was turning into a weathered statue. The cracks didn't stop until he turned completely to dust and dissipated in the air.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods in the pill refining workshop were dumbfounded at the scene? no one dared to move.</p>

  <p>While the power Nicholas released was extremely strong, there wasn't any particular aura. Even the people outside the pill-refining workshop failed to notice anything. Just how powerful was this man that he could control his strength to such extent? they all wondered.</p>

  <p>The True Gods present immediately drew a conclusion. No matter what level he was at, for him, taking their lives was as easy as crushing an ant.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Hamish Hu looked up and pointed to the sky.</p>

  <p>Specks of dust began to appear again? they continued gathering until they gradually formed legs, clothes, and hair.</p>

  <p>And soon, the True God Nicholas had just turned to dust was whole once again? he looked at himself, completely unaware of what was going on.</p>

  <p>"You're still as hot-tempered as you were before," the old man said indifferently.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas cared nothing for the display. He only asked eagerly,</p>

  <p>"Where is Lorena?"</p>

  <p>"She has been hiding underground? she used the nether power to create a separate space, so I failed to detect her existence before. The space she is in is not connected to the divine land whatsoever," said the old man calmly. "But I sensed it, somehow. She has probably exposed her location."</p>

  <p>"Where is the place?" Nicholas pressed further.</p>

  <p>He had no interest in how Lorena hid herself. He just wanted to find her.</p>

  <p>"It's under the ancestral land of the Han Clan, about one hundred thousand miles off to the north of Six-Burden Divine City," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Master Hamish!" With his hands clasped in gratitude, Nicholas was ready to leave.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the old man turned to him and said, "Remember your promise and do not break it."</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes flashed with a glint as he smiled. "Of course I won't forget it!" Then, he turned and left without another word.</p>

  <p>Behind him, Hamish Hu held a herb in his hand as a smile flashed across his face. "I hope you mean it!" he called out.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had chosen to side with the Yellow Emperor Guards because of Lorena. But if he could get what he wanted, he probably wouldn't hesitate to betray the Yellow Emperor Guards? Hamish Hu knew Nicholas' personality well.</p>

  <p>Only then did Hamish Hu notice that all the True Gods in the pill-refining room were staring at him in fear.</p>

  <p>Never did they expect to see this obedient old man would be respected by such a strong cultivator!</p>

  <p>And this man had a remarkable token? the True God had already turned to ash, but he could easily bring him back with a simple wave of a finger. Just what method did he use?</p>

  <p>"Don't you have better things to do than to stare at me? Mind your own business," said the old man lightly.</p>

  <p>His voice seemed to be somehow laced with a powerful wave of soul power. In an instant, this power invaded all the minds of the True Gods, actively erasing a portion of their memories.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were trembling as their eyes grew full of confusion.</p>

  <p>But this trance lasted only momentarily before they came back to their senses? the scene they had just witnessed was completely erased from their minds.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God who had been previously pulverized once again shouted at Hamish Hu, "You old bastard, how dare you slack off!"</p>
