<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2673 The Real Godly Way Tablet </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The divine land was huge, so even with that clue, it was impossible to guess who the person that was sent to the divine land would be.</p>

  <p>Nicholas then asked, "Did you make a record of the thirteen regions?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course! I even noted down the areas that the thirteen space channels are linked to in the thirteen regions," Murphy replied.</p>

  <p>"Well done." Nicholas nodded approvingly before turning to a guard beside him and asked, "Did Lowell come back?"</p>

  <p>The guard put his hands together in respect and replied, "Lowell has returned, and Troy has also returned from the forbidden area!"</p>

  <p>"Ask them to come to the Goldenrain Hall and tell them I need them," said Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>After receiving the instruction from Nicholas, the guard transformed into a ray of light and flew away.</p>

  <p>"The areas in the thirteen regions are too large. I need to send my people to investigate too! If they did send someone in, then this person's cultivation level could not be that of a Demi-holy Being or a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>We still have the chance to find the person and find out the truth. And I need to tell this to Clark and the others immediately! " Once he had finished speaking, he flew into the void and returned to his Floating Island.</p>

  <p>If it was a Holy Being or a Demi-holy Being that wanted to return to the divine land, there was no need for them to create a space channel and send him or her into a large region.</p>

  <p>Based on this logic, Nicholas and Murphy speculated that this person's cultivation should be at the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it still didn't make sense. How could a True God born in the divine land run into the chaos without being corroded to death?</p>

  <p>And now the person was being sent back again. This matter was very strange, so they had to investigate.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Goldenrain Hall, Troy stood straight. He lowered his head and observed his iron hand which gleamed with silver light.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he heard the sound of footsteps coming from outside the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>A handsome young man walked in slowly.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the young man, Troy's face darkened. "What? You are still alive?!"</p>

  <p>The young man was Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming had now achieved a high position in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Now, Nicholas was slack in exploring the Abyss Demon Region. The alliance of the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands could only choose the Abyss Demon Region among the four great forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the exploration of the Abyss Demon Region could only be handed over to these warriors of the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Tianming had done many meritorious deeds in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>After he reached the consummation of True God Realm, he had even discovered a special secret land on the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Tianming was now held in high esteem by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I won't die before you do." Tianming raised his eyebrows and smiled confidently at Troy.</p>

  <p>In the Dongfang Clan, Troy was the best warrior, second only to Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The gap of strength between him and the other consummate True Gods of the Dongfang Clan was too huge that all of them were no match for him. When the Mountain of Holy Beings descended next time, Troy would definitely compete to become a Holy Being, and the Dongfang Clan would definitely give him their full support.</p>

  <p>However, the appearance of Lowell, whose true identity was Tianming, made him feel slightly threatened.</p>

  <p>In recent years, Nicholas had summoned Lowell many times. The first time he summoned Lowell, he had given him the Cyan Yellow Double Swords. Later, when Lowell married Iris, Nicholas even granted him the Ray Token, which symbolized that Lowell had been formally recognized as the core figure of the Dongfang Clan!</p>

  <p>Besides that, the resources of the Dongfang Clan also were in Lowell's favor, and his cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds!</p>

  <p>When he was still a top-rank True God, he had already been unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Now that he had entered the consummation of True God Realm, it made Troy feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>Feeling that his position was threatened, Troy began to go against Lowell in every aspect.</p>

  <p>He had secretly investigated Lowell and found little about his origin.</p>

  <p>Every time this guy returned from the forbidden area, he would quietly leave the Time Sea and disappear for a period of time. During this period of time, there was usually one or a few divine cites that had gotten destroyed, and the slates that protected those divine cities had disappeared mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Troy had once reported his observations to Nicholas and the other elders of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>But because Lowell's performance was too perfect, Troy's suspicions were not taken seriously.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, some of them even warned him, "The Dongfang Clan is in need of talents now. Don't be jealous of other talents. Lowell may be an outsider, but he has married Iris now. So we should treat him as a clansman."</p>

  <p>They thought that he was just being jealous of Lowell and wanted to bring him down! This made him very upset.</p>

  <p>He had lost the trust of the elders because of this man. How could he be nice to him when they met?</p>

  <p>Just as the two men were staring at each other, Nicholas' figure appeared in the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Holy Nicholas!" Tianming saluted.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Uncle Nicolas!" Troy cupped his hands towards Nicholas, but his eyes were still fixed on Lowell, with an unfriendly expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"The two of you need to get ready as soon as possible, and take your people to investigate someone," said Nicholas lightly, ignoring the tense atmosphere in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Troy and Tianming were puzzled.</p>

  <p>There were beings in the divine land that the Holy Beings were unable to track down?</p>

  <p>"There is an uninvited guest from outside that does not belong here. This person may appear in one of the thirteen big regions." Nicholas continued, "Your task is to find that person."</p>

  <p>Both Tianming and Troy were stunned to hear this.</p>

  <p>"From the outside? Does that mean..." Troy's mind began to race, totally forgetting about his annoyance with Lowell.</p>

  <p>Those who were able to enter the divine land and get through the chaos had to be at least beings with the cultivation of Holy Beings. He and Tianming were only consummate True Gods. If they were to search for someone like that, they were not searching for a person, but courting death.</p>

  <p>Nicholas saw the look on Troy's face and told them, "The person is only a True God, a consummate True God at most."</p>

  <p>But these words only made Tianming and Troy even more confused.</p>

  <p>Could a True God return from the chaos unscathed? What the hell was going on?</p>

  <p>However, they controlled their faces carefully and did not reveal their inner thoughts. Since Nicholas had given the order, there was nothing they could do except follow his wishes.</p>

  <p>After receiving the order, they looked at each other briefly before leaving the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>Zheng had originally planned to activate the mountain token as soon as he landed and leave immediately.</p>

  <p>After all, the space channel went through the Murphy's Murphy Universe, and it was very likely to cause trouble...</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was attracted by a strong stream of internal momentum from afar.</p>

  <p>"This stream of internal momentum doesn't seem to come from a True God." Zheng found it very odd.</p>

  <p>Curious, Zheng rose to the air and flew forward.</p>

  <p>After crossing two mountains, Zheng saw a tall stone tablet at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"That is... a Godly Way Tablet!"</p>

  <p>A gleam flashed in Zheng's eyes as he floated in the air.</p>

  <p>He knew that there were three thousand Godly Way Tablets in the divine land, which recorded each individual Godly Way, namely, the three thousand unique skills that Chiyou had mastered.</p>

  <p>He had seen the imitations of these Godly Way Tablets in the ancestral land of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>By taking advantage of the Infinity Ruler in his mind, he was able to swiftly comprehend the internal momentum in a Godly Way Tablet and copy it to the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum, obtained either from the True Gods or from the imitations, might be incomplete...</p>

  <p>While the most complete internal momentum of Godly Ways must come from the real Godly Way Tablets.</p>
