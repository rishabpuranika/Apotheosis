<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 211 A Narrow Escape From Death (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not only did that brat, Luo Zheng, take away his demon's holy fire, but he now also conjured a titanic Five-clawed Black Dragon to take his life.</p>

  <p>"I am not giving up!"</p>

  <p>While Aldrich screamed in his heart, Luo Zheng had sent the Five-Clawed Black Dragon to penetrate through the light curtain and rush towards him.</p>

  <p>As Yolande was willing to cooperate as well, she depleted most of her life vitality from her body while the dragon attacked the demon king.</p>

  <p>She was determined to kill Aldrich in one shot.</p>

  <p>"Grr!"</p>

  <p>The Five-Clawed Black Dragon tilted its head and growled while pouncing on Aldrich. It looked so powerful and intimidating that the earth trembled upon its roar. It opened its mouth and unwaveringly came at Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Aldrich found himself cornered and caught in a dilemma. 'Should I dodge?' he thought.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande would not let him escape. Without a doubt, the girl from the human clan would fiercely fight back until he was defeated. In that case, could he face the blow of the Five-Clawed Black Dragon without doing anything?</p>

  <p>Was that even possible?</p>

  <p>Even the powerful Aldrich was not sure he could withstand the attack.</p>

  <p>Even if he could block the attack of the Five-Clawed Black Dragon and still come out alive by luck, the human girl who was right in front of him would still be around to take him down.</p>

  <p>"Grrr� You human brat! I'll make you pay with your life!"</p>

  <p>In his desperation, Aldrich finally realized that there was only one way left for him to survive, and that was to go all out!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the demon king reclaimed all the evil spirits. In the contest of life vitality, retrieving all of it was undoubtedly equivalent to suicide.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Aldrich did not have any other choices.</p>

  <p>At this moment, when he succeeded in reclaiming the evil spirits, Yolande's life vitality trailed closely behind him and overwhelmed Aldrich with devastating force.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Filled with too much life vitality, Aldrich spat out a mouthful of evil blood. The evil spirits that emitted from his body had weakened, as he was extremely hurt.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yolande had consumed enough life vitality during the process when she competed with Aldrich. Otherwise, she would have directly killed the demon king by infusing all her life vitality into his body to make him burst out and self-destruct.</p>

  <p>The injured Aldrich flapped his fleshy wings, his body moving to sidestep every attack of Zheng's huge Five-Clawed Black Dragon. At the same time, he waved his flesh-wings and dashed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was apparent that Aldrich hated Luo Zheng to the core. The demon king looked extremely zealous to kill him as quick as possible for revenge.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng detected Aldrich's sudden attack, his face paled whilst becoming more alert. There was no time for him to reflect on anything else. Immediately, he made a run for it on the light curtain.</p>

  <p>After all, it was not a demon general, but a demon king that was chasing after him!</p>

  <p>If it had been a demon general that he had to face, he could have been capable of fighting back. However, as his opponent was the supreme demon king, he had no other choice but to run desperately. Judging from the current situation, even if he tried escaping, his chances of getting away unscathed were very slim.</p>

  <p>"Shit!" he cursed as he ran.</p>

  <p>Why did he have to endure such distress? Of all people, it just had to be him who was beyond unfortunate today!</p>

  <p>Just then, a whistling sound caught his ear.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he rolled onto the ground as though it were an instinctive response. The next instant, he could not help but be glad, as a steel gray bone spur had brushed past his ear.</p>

  <p>Aldrich's bone spurs were ten times more powerful and rapid than a demon general's bone spurs. Although the bone spur did not cut Luo Zheng, the strong wind that came with the bone spur made his cheeks tingle.</p>

  <p>Standing up from the ground, Luo Zheng quickly shot his broken flying knife without even lifting his head.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap between the demon king and him when it came to speed. Presently, it was very much impossible for him to fight through his vision alone; he had to rely on his instinct and other senses.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, his instinct in fighting had matured through the many battles he endured in the past. Thanks to that, his aim was perfect as he shot the flying knife at the demon king.</p>

  <p>Had his opponent been an ordinary demon general, the broken flying knife would have pierced through without any trouble. Nevertheless, that was not the case, as his opponent was Aldrich. Even though he was badly injured, and his remaining strength was only one-tenth of its normal amount, he was still the unconquerable demon king in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>In an effortless manner, Aldrich reached out his hand and slapped the flying knife away. The broken flying knife, which had never failed Luo Zheng, regrettably did not have any effect on Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Although his attempt was futile, it had bought some time for Luo Zheng to escape. At the very least, he managed to run several meters away from the demon king during the distraction.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his insane speed was beyond Zheng's imagination. With a flap of his wings, Aldrich's huge body cut through the air and pounced on Luo Zheng like a savage beast.</p>

  <p>"Human brat, go to hell!</p>

  <p>I am going to devour your flesh and suck your blood dry!" Then, four bone spurs came out from Aldrich's body while they were all aimed at Luo Zheng from different directions.</p>

  <p>If any of the bone spurs struck him, it would render his cruel destiny set in stone. As the enraged demon king intended to suck his corpse dry, Luo Zheng could already imagine himself perishing and turning into a mummy.</p>
