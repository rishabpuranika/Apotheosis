<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3997 Running </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the Treacherous Being drilled into him, Luo Zheng completely lost control of his body.</p>

  <p>Like flowing water, the Treacherous Being drilled into every bone in Luo Zheng's body, assimilating itself into him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Treacherous Being did not invade his soul.</p>

  <p>Helplessly, Luo Zheng watched as the Treacherous Being made him run haphazardly.</p>

  <p>At some point, he ended up in the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>In its low-lying land, the Blood Swamp lived up to its name. Blood spurted and splashed everywhere.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng ran uncontrollably, he tried communicating with his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, where are we? Why is there blood everywhere?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"This is the Blood Swamp," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered. "It is very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will die here."</p>

  <p>For Eternal Realm Hunters who were familiar with the Blood Swamp, this place might not have been so terrifying.</p>

  <p>But to those who stumbled into it for the first time, the Blood Swamp was hell.</p>

  <p>Underneath the surface of the blood-red puddles, there lived bright red leeches. They camouflaged perfectly with the scarlet blood, and it was difficult even for the spiritual sense to detect them.</p>

  <p>Once they quietly latched themselves onto someone, they would release toxins that paralyzed their victims. Then, slowly, those bloodthirsty leeches would devour their victims' souls.</p>

  <p>The most terrifying part was that, once they devoured the souls, they would occupy their victims' bodies for a while.</p>

  <p>The Soul Leeches didn't have a mind of their own, but they instinctively moved their victims to the Worm Lizards.</p>

  <p>The Blood Swamp also had a unique ecosystem.</p>

  <p>The Worm Lizard was massive. It was on top of the food chain in the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>Any creature that had the misfortune of stumbling across the nests of the Worm Lizards would be dragged into the darkness, never to see the light of day again.</p>

  <p>However, the Worm Lizards couldn't leave their nests, so their range of movement was limited. Except for those who didn't know much about the Blood Swamp, all the creatures knew to avoid the Worm Lizards' nests.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they depended on the Soul Leeches to hunt for them.</p>

  <p>However, it was a mutual relationship. The Soul Leeches hunted willingly because they needed the Worm Lizards' blood in order to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng ran haphazardly through the swamp, viscous blood splashed all over him.</p>

  <p>The Soul Leeches took this opportunity and quietly latched onto his body.</p>

  <p>Slowly, they crawled towards his head.</p>

  <p>Although these Soul Leeches were very small, Luo Zheng noticed them immediately.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, there are leeches crawling all over me!" Luo Zheng cried.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was silent for a moment as he studied the situation. "These are the Soul Leeches. They can devour your soul."</p>

  <p>"What? These little things can devour my soul?" Luo Zheng echoed, his brows furrowing in concern.</p>

  <p>"Yes, their abilities are very magical, and they often..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven began to warn Luo Zheng, but he had already sprung into action.</p>

  <p>"Guess I'll have to get rid of them!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng willed his soul to attack the Soul Leeches.</p>

  <p>Since he'd already reached the Holy Soul Realm, his soul was much stronger than that of an ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. It wasn't hard for him to slay the leeches that crawled all over his body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul glowed dangerously and countless tiny rays of light shot out.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The rays of light turned into small swords which slashed at the Soul Leeches. They didn't stand a chance. In the blink of an eye, the Soul Leeches that latched onto Luo Zheng's body were shredded to pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>However, since he was still running uncontrollably, more blood splashed onto him, and with it, more leeches latched onto his skin. Some leeches even managed to take a bite out of Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Even with the help of nine Holy Soul Imprints, his soul was still unable to withstand the attacks from the Soul Leeches.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng winced in pain. He knew he couldn't hold out any longer. So, he willed his soul to retreat back into the depths of his mind.</p>

  <p>"These leeches are so powerful!" he whined.</p>

  <p>The Soul Leeches had only managed to take a few bites, but he already felt half his soul was paralyzed.</p>

  <p>"You didn't let me finish speaking," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reprimanded. "Let Zhurong deal with them."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhurong appeared above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zhurong's energy soul was shrouded in flames, which burned over Luo Zheng's head. Soon, the flames enveloped Luo Zheng's entire body. From afar, he looked like a burning man running desperately.</p>

  <p>The Soul Leeches on Luo Zheng's body were scorched into nothingness by the flames, and the blood from the swamp evaporated quickly.</p>

  <p>That was one problem dealt with. However, he was still being controlled by the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>By now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Luo Zheng had already figured out that the Treacherous Being didn't have its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>What the Treacherous Being had said when it possessed Luo Zheng's body had been deciphered by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It was instinctively expressing its regret and anger, trying to break free from the shackles of the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>Now it ran like mad, driven solely by instinct.</p>

  <p>As for where it was running towards, Luo Zheng didn't have the slightest clue.</p>

  <p>Neither did he have the time to figure it out, since his top priority now was to stay alive.</p>

  <p>Zhurong was just a wisp of energy soul, and before long, his energy was exhausted.</p>

  <p>So he was sent back to Luo Zheng's inner world. Now, it was Emperor Di Jun's turn to make a move. After him, another would take his place.</p>

  <p>The human heroes had become Luo Zheng's bodyguards, protecting his soul from being devoured by the Soul Leeches.</p>

  <p>While the many human heroes took turns to attack, Luo Zheng's body suddenly stepped into a large pond.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he didn't sink. At the pace he was running, it was a piece of cake for him to walk on the water.</p>

  <p>However, he had only taken a few strides forward when a massive head suddenly emerged from the water. It was a Worm Lizard's head. The pond was its nest!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The huge Worm Lizard opened its big mouth and swallowed Luo Zheng in one gulp.</p>

  <p>It was a creature in the Supreme Pure Realm, so it was far stronger than the creatures in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Worm Lizard had sensed Luo Zheng's presence long ago through those Soul Leeches, but it was very disappointed that Luo Zheng killed them off so easily.</p>

  <p>However, to its delight, Luo Zheng came straight to its nest. Such good luck!</p>

  <p>The Worm Lizard excitedly snapped its mouth shut and was sinking back into the pond when suddenly, cracks as thick as an arm appeared on the surface of its skull.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The cracks rapidly spread, causing the Worm Lizard to feel a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>'What's going on here...' it thought confusedly.</p>

  <p>When it finally realized that it was the human in its mouth that was causing the cracks, it was too late. Before it could even react, its head exploded into tiny pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng emerged, unscathed, and continued sprinting across the pond as though nothing happened.</p>
