<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 474 Yan's Homicidal Intent (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After a while, Elder Xu's huge leaf reached the mountaintop and landed steadily on the platform. Luo Zheng stepped out from behind Elder Xu and stared at his sister in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Brother and sister stood frozen as they locked eyes.</p>

  <p>They had dreamed about their reunion thousands of times, but when it really happened, they were so surprised that they found it difficult to believe.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu stood aside silently. Although he had witnessed many departures and reunions during his past life, he still felt touched by the scene. The world of martial arts was cruel, yet it didn't lack such warm moments between families.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" Yan stood from the ground, rushed toward Luo Zheng, and threw herself into his arms without a second thought.</p>

  <p>She hugged her brother tightly. She was so excited that she forgot that she was a sixteen-year-old girl instead of a little kid.</p>

  <p>They had been separated for many years, and they had never thought that they would meet again in such a place and under these circumstances.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stroked his sister's hair affectionately as complex emotions coursed through him. They enjoyed the joy of the reunion and hugged for a long time before pulling away and observing each other.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Yan had grown as tall as Luo Zheng, and the little girl in his memories had changed into the beautiful young girl who now stood in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, how did you come here? It should have been prohibited. But Elder Xu has escorted you here." Yan asked. She knew that Luo Zheng had become an inner disciple as she noticed his black clothing, but she didn't understand why he enjoyed such special treatment from Elder Xu.</p>

  <p>"I attended the All Peaks Competition," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Really?" asked Yan, her eyes widening in surprise. There was a hint of doubt in her expression. After all, Luo Zheng had only been a half-step into the nature level six months before, and it would be difficult for him to reach the threshold of the All Peaks Competition no matter how much he had progressed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"What is the result?" asked Yan. She had taken part in the event previously and had got a good grade. Thanks to her outstanding performance, Lady Peak had ranked second among the thirty-three peaks. In the past, Yan had been defeated by a personal disciple. Despite that battle, she was ranked eighth in the Cloud Sect Chart, although her name was removed from the Chart after she was sent to Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>"There's still one fight left before the final result is announced," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"One fight left? What do you mean?" Yan asked perplexedly.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu chuckled from the side and piped in, "He's right. There's still one more fight. It will be held in three days, and it will decide who takes the first place and who ranks second in this All Peaks Competition."</p>

  <p>"What?" Yan covered her mouth with her hand, and her brown eyes were filled with astonishment. "The first place and... the second? But brother, you... You are only at the second grade of the nature level now, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng said, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"But, but..." Yan found it difficult to believe their words. However, she knew of Elder Xu's status at Cloud Sect. She believed that there was no need for him to deceive her. Aside from that, it was Elder Xu who had brought Luo Zheng to Hell Mountain, and the special treatment further proved that Luo Zheng had achieved excellent results in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Yan stammered several times. When no words came out, she smiled with embarrassment. The childish innocence on her face added to her beauty.</p>

  <p>After a while, she recovered from her astonishment and said with a smile, "That is great! I always knew that my brother is the best!"</p>

  <p>Despite her astonishment, Yan accepted the incredible fact in a short time because she believed in her brother.</p>

  <p>In her mind, Luo Zheng had always been invincible. Perhaps, for this reason, it didn't take her long to overcome the doubt she had initially felt.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, how is our father?" Yan suddenly changed the topic.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression hardened when he heard her question. His sister still didn't know that their father had passed away.</p>

  <p>He wondered, 'How should I tell her?</p>

  <p>I can't conceal the truth from her.</p>

  <p>Even if I don't tell her now, she will find out, sooner or later.'</p>

  <p>After hesitating for a while, Luo Zheng eventually said honestly, "Our uncles murdered him."</p>

  <p>"W-w-what?" Yan stammered, shocked by the grievous news.</p>

  <p>"Bryson and Ken were two ruthless beasts. They murdered our dad to steal the position of clan head," Luo Zheng explained in an icy cold voice.</p>

  <p>"Zoom!"</p>

  <p>The life vitality around Yan's body transformed into numerous sharp spines all of a sudden. Her Purple Power Body contained more life vitality than others at the same level. What was more, she absorbed energy from the air at a much higher speed. Owing to these two reasons, Yan didn't always keep all her life vitality inside her body as most people did. Sometimes, she even needed to spend some excessive vitality purposely.</p>

  <p>And now, she used the life vitality around her body to form spines, which displayed the monstrous homicidal intent inside her and allowed her to vent her fierce emotions.</p>
