  <p>
</p>

  <p>Neither Ray nor Conn expected it, and they were astonished!</p>

  <p>Then the two of them laughed loudly as if they'd just heard a hilarious joke.</p>

  <p>Echoing their laughter, the entourage standing behind the princes laughed heartily as well.</p>

  <p>Behind Ray, the guests guffawed, laughing so hard that some were doubled over, clutching their bellies.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's threat was the funniest joke they'd ever heard.</p>

  <p>"Did I hear him right? Did he say that he would destroy our country? My word, this boy isn't in his right mind."</p>

  <p>"The empire has survived many threats, and is still standing. It's strong, and will stand forever. How dare he threaten us? Has he lost his mind completely!?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I had confidence! This man takes the cake! Ha-ha! He has so much bluster that his wind could cause a tornado!"</p>

  <p>Even the usually serious, taciturn chief eunuch smiled, as did Hendy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed a genius from the Cloud Sect, the type of genius that came once a millennium.</p>

  <p>But, as with any title, genius, denoted potential, and not necessarily what he had already achieved.</p>

  <p>Many geniuses were born into the world every year, but, few endured long enough to mature into seasoned warriors because it was the age of survival of the fittest!</p>

  <p>A few worked to make their way up towards the top, whereas the rest blended into the crowd, or worse yet, became nothing more than a heap of bones on the ground. The world might be full of opportunities, but it also demanded precise moves. One wrong step could mean doom, on any given day. A genius would be wise to maintain a low profile if he wanted to survive. As a fledgling, which Luo Luo Zheng was, he'd made a grave mistake.</p>

  <p>Because the Burning Sky Empire was like a huge monster. It was the largest, and strongest empire in the Eastern Region, making this a superpower to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>On the grander scale, there were more prominent countries than the Burning Sky, and, no country could remain the most powerful in this big, evil world.</p>

  <p>And one day, doom was bound to befall the empire, but not at Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>In order to destroy the Burning Sky Empire, Luo Luo Zheng would need to be as formidable, if not stronger, as Kenneth, and as far as Ray and Conn could see, that was a slim to none possibility. Luo Luo Zheng had the same odds of being as powerful as Kenneth, as being struck by lightning walking down the street, on a bright, sunny day.</p>

  <p>Ray sighed loudly and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, I was about to draw you over to my side. But, I see now that you are brainless, so, I give up!"</p>

  <p>Conn shook his head and echoing the sentiment, added, "Normally, anyone bold enough to offend either of us would be dead by now. You aren't like them though. Since you are about to submit yourself to the Test of the Cloud Road, you won't be killed. However, you do need to be taught a lesson!"</p>

  <p>At that, the chief eunuch stepped from behind Conn with an explosion of power bursting from within him, building around him, and billowing like endless sea waves.</p>

  <p>As the pressure continued to increase, it rose above the level an Illuminating Soul warrior possessed, and everyone there became overwhelmed with the crushing force, particularly, Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Luo Zheng realized that the eunuch was stronger than he'd initially thought. Instead of being at the consummation stage of Illuminating Soul Realm, this guy was an expert warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>The Internal Elixir Realm was a level Luo Luo Zheng hadn't learned much about, yet.</p>

  <p>And the only warrior Luo Luo Zheng knew who was at the Internal Elixir Realm was Kenneth.</p>

  <p>It had been just the other day that Luo Luo Zheng had witnessed Kenneth's strength in battle. Kenneth's destructive power shocked the entire Cloud Sect population when he threw a single strike, which eliminated Saint Viana as he attempted to escape, and turned him into a pile of charred, bloody entrails and flesh.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng presumed the eunuch's strength was the same as Kenneth's, the eunuch didn't strike at Luo Luo Zheng. Alternatively, the eunuch used his energy, building it to crush Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>The intense pressure exerted weighted Luo Luo Zheng down and it felt as though he was sinking in a large lake with thousands of pounds of cold water, where the force made it impossible for him to breathe.</p>

  <p>Concurrently, Hendy moved, releasing his hidden strengths, and forcing a tremendous amount of pressure onto Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng felt the intensity, he determined Hendy was a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm too.</p>

  <p>Albeit, there were subtle differences in the strength wielded by each assailant. If the eunuch's force was like the rippling, icy-cold lake, then, Hendy's was a high mountain, falling on Luo Zheng's soul with brutal intensity.</p>

  <p>Together, the two were a savage pair, and most opponents crumbled quickly. If Luo Luo Zheng had been an ordinary warrior, he'd be dead by now!</p>

  <p>The impact of the pressure each attacker forced onto Luo Luo Zheng challenged his soul, while it tortured his physical form.</p>

  <p>Having a body forged and enhanced like an indestructible fortress meant it was easier for Luo Luo Zheng to deal with bodily harm. And while he could virtually ignore the corporeality pressure exerted on him, the real difficulty was the weight pushing against him mentally.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!" Mu Ning called out in an anxiety-ridden voice. Even if the two masters promised not to hurt Luo Luo Zheng physically, they could decimate him mentally, which would cause more damage than any physical attack, and yet, wouldn't be violating the rules.</p>

  <p>She was worried, but, she couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>What could she do though? When Luo Luo Zheng was faced with Vale, she used her title as a deterrence.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was attacked by the saints, she helped him out again, by utilizing her position and power to resolve the dilemma.</p>

  <p>Now though, there wasn't any way for her to help him!</p>

  <p>Her current situation was complicated. She wasn't able to fend for herself because her brothers looked down on her while her title and position were nothing special to them. How could she deter her brothers and their escorts to help Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew large, brimming with anxiety, but she was helpless.</p>
