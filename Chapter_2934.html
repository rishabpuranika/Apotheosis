<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The brocade box traveled two hundred billion miles and appeared in Zheng's hand in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The brocade box cracked open, revealing a bit of the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Zheng had obtained the Reincarnation Soul Weapon in the Reincarnation Land, but he wasn't able to read Samuel's memory at the time. He knew that Samuel must have done something to hide his Memory Flame, but he had no idea where the latter hid it.</p>

  <p>But now Zheng knew all about the divine land. He would immediately learn about the entire truth once a question popped out in his heart.</p>

  <p>"I am not like Nicholas, who gave you the opportunity to return. Your memory will be gone along with you..." Zheng said in a menacingly low voice.</p>

  <p>The moment Samuel saw the brocade box, a terrified expression spread across his face.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of the destruction of the whole universe or even of his physical body. After all, as long as his Memory Flame still existed, he could return.</p>

  <p>Back then, he knew that he would be invincible as long as he kept the Memory Flame intact.</p>

  <p>He had extraordinary talent, and he had the experience being a Holy Being in two lifetimes. Even if he was killed, he could be reborn again and again.</p>

  <p>Samuel had never expected Zheng to find his Memory Flame so easily.</p>

  <p>"How... How did you know that?" Samuel asked in a trembling voice, as the arrogance in his eyes slowly faded away.</p>

  <p>"The divine land has no secrets from me," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Let me go! Please! Give me a chance. I can ask both my daughters to stay with you and serve you if you want!" Samuel begged shakily.</p>

  <p>He thought he was offering Zheng a good deal but in truth, it would have been better if he didn't mention Liusu and Aleyna. When he spoke of his daughters, Zheng flew into a rage. With a flick of his finger, he immediately extinguished the green Memory Flame!</p>

  <p>Even after the universe collapsed, and the body and soul were both destroyed, Samuel would not really die until his Memory Flame was put out.</p>

  <p>Since he had these multiple layers of protection, normal people, or even the Yellow Emperor Guards, wouldn't succeed in trying to kill him.</p>

  <p>Samuel's miserable end sent a chill down the spines of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In fact, Samuel's death was exactly what the Holy Beings were looking forward to witnessing. Even Clark and Murphy, who held a grudge against Zheng, hoped for Samuel to be killed.</p>

  <p>However, the fact that Zheng was able to crash an entire universe with such ease was a big reason for worry for the Holy Beings. This meant that their fate was in Zheng's hands. He could kill anyone he wanted!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Leyton, who was not far away, was still struggling to deflect the thunder punishment.</p>

  <p>Leyton had surprised Zheng with his strength. He seemed to have used up all the blood in the Sea Cracking Skull and his body was dripping with blood at this point. The blood was able to pollute the thunder punishment.</p>

  <p>Every time the thunder punishment hit him, the power of thunder and lightning weakened. A short while later, Leyton managed to completely destroy the thunder punishment.</p>

  <p>But he had paid a price for his victory. He looked rather disheveled and was charred all over. He was gasping and his face had turned pale.</p>

  <p>The Sea Cracking Skull was tossed on the ground and its surface was dry and filled with cracks. It was in a bad shape.</p>

  <p>"You have withstood the thunder punishment. That's indeed very commendable, but it's a pity that your trump card seems to be broken," Zheng observed.</p>

  <p>Without the Sea Cracking Skull, Leyton wouldn't be able to overcome Estelle's Scepter of Gods' Silence, but Zheng could use the power of the Soul Wilderness freely. In addition to that, considering Leyton's present state, he would be no match for Zheng at all!</p>

  <p>Leyton's face darkened as he glared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>In less than two hours, the four Yellow Emperor Guards who had been following him for so many years had all died. His heart was filled with misgivings.</p>

  <p>"It's such a pity. If Master Clement had come to the divine land ahead of time, then he would have prevented you from entering the Mountain of Holy Beings," Leyton murmured.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng was taken aback. "Master Clement? Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's reaction, Leyton felt a tinge of hope. "He is a strong member of our Bear race, who has joined the Sky Guard Pavilion. It's likely that he might have already slaughtered all your friends outside the divine land. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed suddenly.</p>

  <p>He was aware of everything that went on in the divine land, but had no idea of what had happened outside.</p>

  <p>Both his parents were outside the divine land, and Zheng had taken it for granted that they were absolutely safe under the protection of Timotheus and Emily. But according to what Leyton said, there was actually another Yellow Emperor Guard, who had descended to the divine land. This was a major cause for concern for him.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was lost in thought, Leyton's eyes glittered with a hint of madness.</p>

  <p>He suddenly came next to Zheng in a flash.</p>

  <p>Click, click, click!</p>

  <p>Leyton was leaning against Zheng's back and had tightly grabbed him by the waist.</p>

  <p>"You can go ahead and kill me, but you have to pay the price with your life.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, several blood-red silk threads gushed out of Leyton's body, and bound him together with Zheng. An indescribable aura erupted from his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng was too young after all. As he was distracted by what Leyton said, he actually got trapped by his opponent.</p>

  <p>He activated the power of the Soul Wilderness with his mind, trying to block the power emanating from Leyton's body.</p>

  <p>To his disappointment, the power of the Soul Wilderness had no effect. It failed to suppress Leyton's powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, he is burning the Other Shore Token," No. 9527 reminded him.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is the Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>Zheng, of course, had no idea what this was.</p>

  <p>"It is the most important thing for the warriors at the Other Shore Realm; it's their source of strength. If they burn the Other Shore Token, they will be punished by the truth, so this guy will have a very miserable ending..." No. 9527 elaborated.</p>

  <p>Leyton's eyes turned red. By this time his whole body seemed to have been soaked in blood. The force erupted by him had surpassed his own strength.</p>

  <p>The power within his body began to surge wildly. Leyton was a thin man, but right now he had turned into a large person.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, who were watching from not far away, sensed his power, and were petrified. They quickly fled the scene using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Unlike the others, Holy Jay and Estelle tried to fly towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Go away! Run!"</p>

  <p>Zheng warned them.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for him to estimate how much power Leyton would unleash by burning the Other Shore Token. After all, he only learned about the Other Shore Token seconds ago.</p>

  <p>With all this uncertainty, there was only one option left for Zheng. He used the Grand Teleportation technique, and took Leyton, who was still expanding crazily, to the space channel and then moved deeper into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay watched Zheng disappear with Leyton, and the next moment, a dull roar broke forth from the Time Sea. The entire ground around the Time Sea began to shake violently and in the middle of the Time Sea, there appeared a mass of bright red blood.</p>

  <p>Even the fragments of time could not devour all the blood, and a strong smell of blood permeated the skies.</p>
