  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess frowned. She had always placed her hopes on the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree.</p>

  <p>She was under the impression that the humans on the Other Shore would hide the information about them in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds. So she was hoping to find information from the seeds.</p>

  <p>But it just turned out to be a disappointment.</p>

  <p>Fuxi continued, "Perhaps we have to resign ourselves to fate. Zheng found King Manard. Since he asked for it, we can give him the last seed."</p>

  <p>After a moment's silence, the Snake Goddess nodded and waved her hand.</p>

  <p>The two of them returned to the jadeite platform again.</p>

  <p>Shooting a glance at Zheng, she gestured towards him. "Follow me."</p>

  <p>It seemed that she had agreed.</p>

  <p>With a wave, No. 9527 returned to Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess waved her hand once more, and she and Zheng had disappeared from the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>The next thing he knew, Zheng was in a cave.</p>

  <p>It was practically pitch black. He could, however, hear the sounds of dripping water off the walls.</p>

  <p>"This is the internal space of the Pear Hill?" Zheng guessed.</p>

  <p>"It's the innermost part of the Pear Hill," the Snake Goddess answered. She started walking.</p>

  <p>As she walked forward, dim lights would appear around the cave. It was some complex magic arrays that emitted the glow.</p>

  <p>Although these magic arrays had not been activated, they embodied terrifying abilities. Obviously, this was the most important place of the Pear Hill, since it was so heavily guarded.</p>

  <p>After walking more than two hundred feet, they reached the end of the cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced around. He noticed the soil here was white, and towards the end of the cave stood a tree as tall as a person.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the tree in surprise.</p>

  <p>The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree was invaluable to the Pear Hill. It was not necessarily as tall and intimidating as the divine trees in the divine land, but it should be full of vitality.</p>

  <p>However, to Zheng's surprise, it had signs of decaying from its roots, and its naked branches were almost completely devoid of leaves. The few leaves it did have had already turned yellow. If it weren't for a single light green fruit on it, Zheng would've thought it was already dead.</p>

  <p>"Its life is coming to an end," said the Snake Goddess, staring at the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree sadly.</p>

  <p>This tree was a channel that she had used to communicate with the humans on the Other Shore. With the withering of this tree, it wouldn't be able to do so anymore. Now, there was only one fruit left.</p>

  <p>She walked forward and gingerly plucked the single fruit. Gently, she peeled off the outer shell, revealing a seed that glowed a bright blue. She took a moment to look at it longingly, but then ultimately turned to Zheng and said, "Pour your blood power into it and it can work."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she handed the seed to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the seed gratefully and inspected it. After he tucked it into his space ring, the Snake Goddess waved her hand, and they both appeared on the jadeite platform again.</p>

  <p>Since he had received the seed, Zheng fulfilled his end of the deal and wrote down the Truth of Three-Energy Construction word by word.</p>

  <p>As he handed over the complete Truth of Three-Energy Construction to the Snake Goddess, Zheng suddenly recalled something important. "Snake Goddess, after you master the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, please pay attention to one thing."</p>

  <p>"What's it?" asked the Snake Goddess curiously.</p>

  <p>"King Manard extremely hates any race that isn't human. If a human enters that space, it'd be fine. But if any other race enters, they'd probably be attacked," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was born together with the Human Sovereign. She must have a lot of connections with the humans on the Other Shore, but King Manard might not know about this.</p>

  <p>Although the little monsters probably wouldn't be able to lay a finger on the Snake Goddess, King Manard's strength was immeasurable. If the two fought in that space, who knew what might happen?</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had spent about three months in that space before he was able to master the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were highly talented, it would probably take them some time, too.</p>

  <p>If Zheng returned to that space to inform King Manard before the Snake Goddess and Fuxi entered, there would be less room for misunderstandings.</p>

  <p>Just then, a thought crossed Fuxi's mind. As he stretched out his palm, a golden red crystal appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>This golden red crystal had come from the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits. Zheng had given thirty of them to Yan when he left the Chaotic Source World. Yan didn't know what they were used for, so she had given one to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>It was also the first time for Fuxi to see such a crystal. According to his judgment, the crystal was very similar to the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits. He was certain people could absorb it.</p>

  <p>But he still hadn't figured out how to refine it.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, it would be best if you stay in the Pear Hill," the Snake Goddess said authoritatively. "Once Fuxi figures it out, you can immediately cultivate."</p>

  <p>Yan glanced at her brother eagerly, her eyes twinkling. Of course, she hoped to spend time with him.</p>

  <p>But to her disappointment, Zheng politely shook his head.</p>

  <p>Xun, Yudie and the others had already settled down in the Oneness Sky Palace. Even Zheng felt like he had already taken root there as well.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Oneness Sky Palace was a decent sect of swordsmanship, which was a more suitable place for Zheng to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, outside the Source World, a massive chaos cloud was constantly rolling.</p>

  <p>In the midst of flashing lightning, a huge figure flew in the sky. It was none other than the Thunder Dimorphodon!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Its gigantic body moved blithely, quickly drawing closer to the chaos cloud in the distance.</p>

  <p>After it entered the chaos cloud, it saw a small light spot. The light had a strong penetrating power, and even the chaotic energy was unable to stop it.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the Thunder Dimorphodon finally reached the light spot.</p>

  <p>Above the light spot stood a man in an embroidered robe, with an ordinary bamboo basket on his back. With the sleeves rolled up, he looked like a farmer who had been hidden in the mountains.</p>

  <p>This man was Divine Farmer, the leader of the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>"You got them?" Divine Farmer asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Thunder Dimorphodon. "But there is a slight problem."</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's smile froze. He knew clearly that the Thunder Dimorphodon seldom encountered problems in its life. "What's the problem?"</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship stopped me on the way and took away half of the rings," said the Thunder Dimorphodon. With its huge paw gently lifted, small rings of light floated in front of Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's expression fell. "The Black Ship? Why would they target you? As far as I know, they should not be interested in the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>The Black Ship was also known as a super force, despite having only thirteen members. It seldom cultivated disciples and rarely went to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why they went to the Chaotic Source World either. They had been there since the beginning. I didn't expect to be intercepted by them after I got rid of Fuxi," said the Thunder Dimorphodon through gritted teeth. It was angry at the mention of the Black Ship.</p>
