  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the north of the Jade Pure Realm, an enormous brown cubic rock stood on the ground.</p>

  <p>This cubic rock was 99, 000 feet long, 99, 000 feet wide, and 99, 000 feet high.</p>

  <p>On its surface, an exit opened for every thirty feet in the span of its entire height.</p>

  <p>Its inside was hollow, giving way to many intricate caves and passages.</p>

  <p>This place was called the Heavenly Square City, and it was one of the headquarters of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>In a room on the upper left part of the Heavenly Square City was a wounded man dressed in cotton clothes.</p>

  <p>His hands and feet were tightly tied by four iron chains, pulling his limbs straight.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A white whip thrashed violently in the air and lashed hard at the man, landing on his already frail body.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>As the white whip hit him, it emitted a beaming ray of silver-white light, which was the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The man in cotton clothes was a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for ordinary punishment methods to damage a Treacherous Being. However, if they were hit by the Light of Annihilation, they would feel pain as when ordinary mortals were stabbed by thorns.</p>

  <p>This was the case for only the resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Once the hostility-level Treacherous Beings came into contact with the Light of Annihilation, they would instantly turn into fine gray ashes.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The man's clothes were torn and stained with blood as he had suffered many beatings for several days.</p>

  <p>The one who smacked the whip was a human woman. With each hit, she reprimanded the man solemnly, "Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?"</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>"Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?"</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>"Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?!"</p>

  <p>The man's name was Alphonse Shen. He was the chief of the Joy House, which was affiliated to the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The woman, on the other hand, was a subordinate of the Joy House.</p>

  <p>Despite the stern expression on her face, she enjoyed no pleasure from the abuse. Her eyes revealed the pity she felt.</p>

  <p>The Joy House was responsible for guarding the Treasure Bottle Platform to protect the Divine Dao energy.</p>

  <p>Things had been fine in the past chaotic eras. Unfortunately, the Divine Dao energy was stolen by the Nihility race some days ago.</p>

  <p>As the chief of the Joy House, Alphonse had to take responsibility for an unforgivable mistake.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>The woman had whipped him day and night.</p>

  <p>She feared that if she continued to hit him with the Light of Annihilation, he might get beaten to death.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, Alphonse silently endured the torment.</p>

  <p>A voice suddenly spoke from outside the room.</p>

  <p>"General Alphonse, how have you been doing these days?" the voice asked with a hint of mockery.</p>

  <p>When the woman heard the voice, she frowned and whipped more forcefully.</p>

  <p>If she was seen with favoritism to the chief, he would only receive greater blame and suffering.</p>

  <p>A person came into the room and motioned her to stop beating. She then paused, carefully retracted the whip, and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>She dared not touch the whip as it contained the tremendous Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The visitor was a middle-aged man from the Ten Directions House. It was General Gianni.</p>

  <p>Alphonse was the chief of the Joy House while Gianni was the chief of the Broad House. They were at the same level; however, whether before or after becoming a Treacherous Being, Alphonse had always remained stronger than Gianni. They regarded each other as rivals.</p>

  <p>After becoming Treacherous Beings, Gianni had been promoted to an important position, while Alphonse had been sent to the Treasure Bottle Platform, which was considered deportation.</p>

  <p>Now Gianni visited him with an obvious intent to laugh at him.</p>

  <p>Alphonse glanced at Gianni indifferently. "Are you going to eliminate my coordinates?" he asked.</p>

  <p>For Treacherous Beings, they could come back to life repeatedly as long as their coordinates remained.</p>

  <p>In fact, all the other attacking methods made no difference to the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The woman's continuous whipping would only bring physical pain to Alphonse but would not kill him.</p>

  <p>Many members of the Joy House had been killed on the Treasure Bottle Platform, but they had all been revived in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, removing their coordinates was equivalent to sentencing their end. It meant eternal death for Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Gianni laughed and said, "General Alphonse, you are known to always set your safety aside. Are you also afraid of death now?"</p>

  <p>"When I got awakened by those snakes, I've been ready for this," replied Alphonse.</p>

  <p>"They are badly in need of talents. They won't kill you for the time being.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Joy House's guardianship at the Treasure Bottle Platform is just the first insurance, and the Divine Dao energy itself is the second insurance!" Gianni declared as he stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"What did you do to it?" Alphonse squinted his eyes.</p>

  <p>Gianni turned around. "Come and release him!" he yelled to the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman's face lit up. She joyously hurried forward and proceeded to untie the chains that bound her chief.</p>

  <p>Gianni then pulled something from his sleeve, taking out a mirror.</p>

  <p>The mirror showed a blurry image. It was vaguely a lake where several black ships floated above the water.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Alphonse asked. He had been guarding the remote Treasure Bottle Platform for many years, so he had poor information.</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship, a force supported by the birds in the Source World,"</p>

  <p>Gianni explained.</p>

  <p>"Is the Divine Dao energy in their hands?" Alphonse asked.</p>

  <p>Gianni nodded and said, "There is a person among them who can fuse the Divine Dao. They must be anxious in creating the perfect Ways-blending Energy."</p>

  <p>"Perfect Ways-blending Energy..." Alphonse rolled his eyes and said, "How can that be perfect?"</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect could scale the number of energy in the secondary worlds either up or down at their will.</p>

  <p>If a world builder set the number of energy in a secondary world to be one thousand in total, then the Ways-blending Energy formed by one thousand kinds of energy would be the limit in this world.</p>

  <p>If the number was three thousand in total, then the Ways-blending Energy formed by three thousand Divine Dao would be the limit.</p>

  <p>"To the chaos, this is already perfection. Have you forgotten that we are also members of the chaos now? Don't use your past eyes to define things,"</p>

  <p>Gianni said.</p>

  <p>They both knew it was difficult for them to return to their original vast world.</p>

  <p>Alphonse glanced at Gianni. "If he masters the complete Ways-blending Energy, he might have the ability to change the structure of the chaos. But you don't seem to be worried at all, do you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, once he merges the last Divine Dao, the second insurance will be triggered. We only need to wait and see," Gianni said with complacency.</p>

  <p>Gianni, Alphonse, and the woman looked closely at the mirror, quietly observing the scene.</p>

  <p>Because the picture was too blurry, they could only recognize the distorted figures of black ships and the lake. The other details remained unknown to them.</p>

  <p>A few hours later...</p>

  <p>The black ship at the center shook violently on the water.</p>

  <p>It was as if an earthquake had started from beneath the lake, creating huge waves.</p>

  <p>After that, a sheet of white light had suddenly swallowed the black ship...</p>

  <p>"That power is extraordinary,"</p>

  <p>Gianni commented as he patted on Alphonse's shoulder. He handed him the mirror and left the room.</p>

  <p>Holding the mirror in his hand, Alphonse watched until the white light dimmed gradually and disappeared.</p>

  <p>The black ship had been wrecked with its pieces scattered on the surface of the lake. Dark blood started gushing out from its ruins.</p>

  <p>The ship was a part of the captain's body. Once it had been damaged too seriously, it wouldn't recover quickly. It reflected that a large amount of blood had been shed from the captain.</p>

  <p>"They suspect that I deliberately allowed the Grandmaster of Heaven to steal the Divine Dao energy from us," concluded Alphonse.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded and asked, "Did he send this mirror to you as a warning?"</p>

  <p>"It's not a warning," said Alphonse. "It's just a token of his contempt. He wants to tell me that whatever I want to do would just turn out pointless!"</p>

  <p>He crushed the mirror into pieces in his hand.</p>
