<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily's face slightly darkened.</p>

  <p>She had used her full strength with that attack. Unexpectedly, Clement effortlessly resisted it.</p>

  <p>He was probably stronger than her, but she couldn't stop now. She had already started this.</p>

  <p>She had no choice but to fight, more so since this was a life-or-death battle.</p>

  <p>There was no turning back.</p>

  <p>As soon as Clement finished speaking, she moved swiftly and disappeared from the spot. At the same time, she sent a message through her life vitality,</p>

  <p>"Timotheus, let's kill him together!"</p>

  <p>A few moments later, she re-appeared beside Clement.</p>

  <p>Clement was startled when he was engulfed by a colorful halo. It never occurred to him that Emily could use the colorful halo to trap him.</p>

  <p>The space within the colorful halo had grown thick, and it became difficult to move. He struggled to escape with the Grand Teleportation but failed.</p>

  <p>Timotheus took this time to move as well. A strong aura surged through his body. He jumped up, a golden hammer and a long golden awl in each hand.</p>

  <p>As he flew over Clement's head, a huge golden shadow appeared behind him. The shadow was like the legendary evil god. It released terrifying power and reeked of murderous aura.</p>

  <p>Timotheus pointed the long golden awl to Clement, his face shadowed. He knocked it hard with the golden hammer in his right hand.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>The shadow emitted a vast amount of power, and this power gathered on the awl. It shot toward Clement, who was still struggling inside the halo.</p>

  <p>This attack from Timotheus was so oppressive that even Emily, who had trapped Clement in the colorful halo, had to retreat. However, she didn't remove the colorful light halo. If she did that, Clement would easily use the Grand Teleportation to escape.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The long golden awl turned into a dazzling golden light and shot towards Clement.</p>

  <p>Although Timotheus and his group had successfully trapped him and killed three Yellow Emperor Guards, Clement still didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>He had such a high opinion of himself. Since he joined the Sky Guard Pavilion, he had never taken the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm seriously. He was truly confident this time, and he thought that he was well-prepared.</p>

  <p>But he didn't expect his opponents to be this hungry for victory. They fought desperately, even from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>He became angry and red-faced, ashamed that he was caught off-guard.</p>

  <p id="top_6">"Since you have a death wish, I'll give you what you want!"</p>

  <p>After he said that, surprisingly, Clement stood still. His posture was relaxed, and he let the long golden awl hit him.</p>

  <p>As the awl stabbed into his forehead, a drop of blood ejected from between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>When the awl met the blood, a metallic sound was heard. To everyone's surprise, the blood blocked Timotheus' deadly strike!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a blood-red ball hidden on top of Clement's head broke open.</p>

  <p>As the ball broke, Timotheus and Emily became ashen-faced. Their plan had failed, and it looked like Clement had something more powerful up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"The Latent Theurgy!"</p>

  <p>The Latent Theurgy was commonly seen in the Source World. However, there was a huge gap between the powers it released. Its power depended heavily on the people that used it.</p>

  <p>Just now, Clement displayed the Latent Theurgy and blocked Timotheus' all-out attack with a single drop of blood. It was incredible.</p>

  <p>"Impressive.</p>

  <p>You forced me to use the Latent Theurgy with only one blow!</p>

  <p>This drop of Ethereal Spirit Blood is so precious to me. I wasn't planning on using it today."</p>

  <p>The drop of blood released by the Latent Theurgy floated around Clement.</p>

  <p>It stopped right on his fingertip. It was difficult to imagine the terrible power it contained.</p>

  <p>"Ethereal Spirit Blood?"</p>

  <p>"He has a drop of Ethereal Spirit Blood?!"</p>

  <p>Shock registered on Emily's and Timotheus' faces.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Blood was extremely rare in the Source World. Even the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm like Emily and Timotheus would find it extremely difficult to obtain even just a drop of it.</p>

  <p>Someone was willing to give Clement the Latent Theurgy that was made from the Ethereal Spirit Blood. This meant that Clement's status was beyond their imagination. Either he was a very important person among the Yellow Emperor Guards, or he came from a very prominent family.</p>

  <p>"Now that this drop of blood has been forced out, I will use it on you."</p>

  <p>As Clement spoke, his voice was eerily calm. The drop of blood quietly extended in his hand and quickly grew. A mass of blood emerged and turned into a palm-sized ball, in which there was a row of sharp tusks.</p>

  <p>"Kill him."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he gracefully pointed at Timotheus, and the blood ball rushed toward him. Then, Clement leisurely turned around, and a blood rune appeared. This blood rune turned into a blood sword in the blink of an eye, and with a flash, it appeared beside Emily and slashed at her head.</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>Emily stretched out her fingers, and a colorful halo spread to block the chop of the blood sword.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the blood sword could weaken anything. The moment it touched the colorful halo, the light of the halo dimmed.</p>

  <p>Clement launched the second strike with no mercy, and Emily could only spread another colorful halo.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>After a few strikes, Clement still looked relaxed, but Emily was gasping for breath.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why the Snake Goddess race works with the Nine Li race,"</p>

  <p>Clement said while he was suppressing Emily.</p>

  <p>He enjoyed the feeling of control that he had over the situation.</p>

  <p>According to his plan, he would meet the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm outside the divine land. There, he would find out where they came from and which side they were on before he fought them. However, they did not give him the chance, which made him feel upset.</p>

  <p>"What does it have to do with you?" Emily answered coldly.</p>

  <p>She turned her hands slightly, and two colorful halos appeared at the same time. One of them blocked Clement's blood sword, and the other headed straight for Clement.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Clement turned the blood sword around with his hand, and the blade of the sword passed the two colorful halos at the same time.</p>

  <p>Right after he broke the halos, he smiled menacingly and stabbed toward Emily's chest. His actions were as smooth as water. "If you promise not to work with the Nine Li race, I'll spare the lives of your race. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race and the Bear race weren't enemies to each other in the Source World. Without a doubt, Clement had made a good offer.</p>

  <p>But Emily knew clearly whom she should give her love and loyalty, and it wasn't to him. Since Zheng had helped her once, she wouldn't fail him now.</p>

  <p>She shook her head and said, "Bad idea!" As she spoke, she swiftly tilted her body and avoided Clement's blood sword, a charming smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Her body grew in an instant, and her white and petite fist turned into a huge fist. It was about a hundred feet high, and it easily smashed Clement.</p>

  <p>The sudden burst of the Wild God Power was far beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>Clement was sent flying like a broken sack.</p>
