<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1541 Pay The Illusion Points </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"He's not the city lord?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Our city lord does not need to kill warriors to accumulate Illusion Points," the warrior explained. "This particular warrior is the city lord's subordinate. He helps the city lord obtain the Illusion Points, and then hands them over to the city lord."</p>

  <p>Naturally, the "handing them over" could only be achieved by the city lord killing the subordinate.</p>

  <p>This meant that the city lord had no need to personally kill the numerous warriors in the city to harvest Illusion Points. Instead, the city lord had this subordinate kill them, and then killed the subordinate to obtain the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng realized this, he smiled ruefully. He actually felt a trace of admiration for the city lord.</p>

  <p>The city lord was only a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. However, in such a short time, he or she had established a set of rules in the Illusion Space and was able to implement them layer by layer. Whoever this person was, he or she was obviously a talented person.</p>

  <p>"Next batch!"</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior brandished his black sword. His sharp, hawk-like gaze swept across the area as he calculated his next move.</p>

  <p>"Move!" urged the warrior who had brought Luo Zheng here. "Once you pay half of your Illusion Points, they won't make things difficult for you again."</p>

  <p>About seven or eight warriors flanked both sides of the city gates, all clearly very self-conscious. They walked toward the blue-robed warrior and let him kill them one by one, giving away half of their Illusion Points to him in the process.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit depressed as he followed the warriors.</p>

  <p>His target was the city lord, not the blue-robed warrior in front of him.</p>

  <p>By doing this, the city lord must have accumulated a large number of Illusion Points. If Luo Zheng were to kill the city lord, he could obtain half of those Illusion Points as well, which was the most economical way to do it.</p>

  <p>However, he had not expected the city lord to avoid coming here personally. Instead, the city lord had sent over this particular subordinate.</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior glanced knowingly at the warriors. His eyes then fell on Luo Zheng. He could faintly feel the hidden Mu Ning in Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he did not take it seriously. No one in this city dared disobey the city lord, unless they planned to stay in the city forever.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, such warriors really existed. Some people could not bear to have such a method used against them, but they could not fight the system. Thus, they stayed in the city and cursed at the city lord and his or her subordinates at every opportunity.</p>

  <p>But what was the use of it?</p>

  <p>Fighters relied on strength, not their tongues.</p>

  <p>"Stand well," the blue-robed warrior said coldly. He waved the black sword in his hand in a circle and once again felt an uncomfortable feeling rise in his heart. His eyes met Luo Zheng once again, and he asked,</p>

  <p>"What is your name? Which force are you from?"</p>

  <p>"I've already been registered," Luo Zheng replied listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Answer my questions!" The blue-robed warrior stared at Luo Zheng with a deep frown.</p>

  <p>"I'm from the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, Spirit Reading World, Humanity Alliance," Luo Zheng answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Very good," the blue-robed warrior said. "After the revival, you will come back and I will kill you once again. A total of three times will allow you to leave the city."</p>

  <p>'Three times?</p>

  <p>Humph! Even one time is impossible for me, ' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>At the warrior's words, the smile on Zheng's face grew wider.</p>

  <p>But although he was smiling, his mood had indeed turned sour.</p>

  <p>This was the Illusion Battlefield. It enabled the warriors of the universe to enter and compete with the others. However, this group of people, relying on their power and influence, had created their own rules and were trying to control the fate of the weak. It was unacceptable.</p>

  <p>Zheng's wide smile made the blue-robed warrior uneasy. "What are you laughing at?" he spat.</p>

  <p>"I'm laughing at you," Luo Zheng said abruptly. "You want my Illusion Points?</p>

  <p>In your dreams!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words lingered for a moment, stunning the blue-robed warrior into silence. His face darkened. "You're courting death!" he spluttered.</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, he flipped the black sword in his hand and slashed it at Luo Zheng without a word.</p>

  <p>As they saw this scene in front of them, the many warriors within the city, including the one who had led Luo Zheng after the registration, widened their eyes in horror.</p>

  <p>When the Illusion Battlefield had opened, many warriors could hardly stand the rules set by the city lord. Some of them had tried to resist them.</p>

  <p>However, the outcome of it had been most cruel.</p>

  <p>The city lord, which was the most talented warrior from the Ji Clan, could easily defeat a city's warriors.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the city lord had Ji Clan's treasure, a supreme divine weapon that allowed him or her to appear and disappear anywhere without a trace.</p>

  <p>It was also because of this supreme divine weapon that almost no warrior could escape the pursuit of the city lord.</p>

  <p>In the end, they accepted their fate and obediently went to register themselves. They then paid half of their Illusion Points by getting themselves killed.</p>

  <p>"Another one who cannot accept his fate has arrived!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, he will soon know better. He will accept his fate eventually.</p>

  <p>Whether inside or outside of the Illusion Battlefield, ordinary warriors are fated to bear the torment of the Ji Clan. How could we possibly fight them?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose this boy's Illusion Points will all be taken away."</p>

  <p>The onlookers stared at Luo Zheng, traces of pity on their faces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the other warriors were lined up in a row. The blue-robed warrior's single sword attack had meant to hack Luo Zheng after killing the several warriors beside him.</p>

  <p>His black sword looked abnormal. As its black blade swung out, it rapidly spun as well. Because of its speedy rotation, the sword did not look like a sword, but rather like a black long stick.</p>

  <p>It was the swift rotation that caused the powerful suction force. It pulled what was in its surroundings onto the sword blade before shattering it.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been killed by the blue-robed subordinate did not only have narrow sword marks on their bodies, but also terrible wounds.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not dodge this strange sword technique.</p>

  <p>Instead, he stretched his hand toward the black sword and made an attempt to grab the blade.</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior grinned fiendishly. The black sword spun a little faster. 'Hah! The boy dares to grab my sword with his bare hand! He will know soon enough that it will only tear him to pieces, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>'How did such a foolish boy exude that strange Mu Ning before?'</p>

  <p>At the moment, the blue-robed warrior was a bit confused about Luo Zheng, but he did not take what he had sensed before seriously. A warrior's intuition was usually accurate, but not always. He wondered if he was just overreacting.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng's hand caught hold of the frantically spinning blade, the blue-robed warrior gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Zheng's hand would rip open when he touched the blade. His flesh and blood should have been splattered by the blade of the sword. The bones of his arm should have been fractured inch by inch before crumbling into dust.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Luo Zheng held onto the sword, the blue-robed warrior heard the explicit sounds of collision.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The scene he had imagined in his head did not happen.</p>

  <p>The rapidly spinning blade still spun in Zheng's hand. The boy was actually holding onto the rotating blade!</p>

  <p>The sharp sounds came from the sword as it was crushed into an unidentifiable shape. It was Zheng's hand that was the source of this crushing power.</p>

  <p>Finally, the sword was fully in Zheng's hand. It stopped spinning as he tightened his grip. As for the blade, it had already curled up.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior's sharp, eagle-like eyes were wide like saucers, a hint of fear in them.</p>

  <p>He had followed his young master for years and encountered many capable warriors. He had also heard of the various talents from the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was able to catch his black sword with just one hand while remaining unscathed. He had surpassed the scope of other talents.</p>

  <p>He was, quite simply, a freak of nature!</p>

  <p>On the city wall, the other warriors witnessed this scene in silence.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, they were happy to see what happened. Some of them had no choice but to serve the city lord. They had paid up their Illusion Points to him or her, however unwilling they might be. Their dignity did not allow them to accept these rules, but they were powerless against the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng's display of power had helped them vent their anger, and from the looks of it, it was going to be a good show.</p>

  <p>"I said you could only take my Illusion Points in your dreams." Luo Zheng smiled as he held the black sword between his fingers and squeezed it forcefully.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound rang out as Luo Zheng broke the black sword into two pieces.</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior took a deep breath. The black sword had been a secondary first-rank divine weapon and had been given to him by the city lord.</p>

  <p>The loss of a weapon in the Illusion Battlefield did not mean that his weapon had disintegrated in the real world as well. However, the warrior still felt a faint sense of foreboding when Luo Zheng broke the secondary first-rank divine weapon so effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The blue-robed warrior already had a plan in mind. He decided to steer clear of Luo Zheng for some time and rushed to the city gates.</p>

  <p>"Wait up! You think you can get away with this after wanting to kill me?</p>

  <p>You can leave, but you still have to give me the Illusion Points!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a smile. How could he let this fat sheep escape?</p>

  <p>The warrior's Illusion Points could not be compared to the city lord's, but they were certainly not little in number.</p>
