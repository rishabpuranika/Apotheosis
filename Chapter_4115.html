<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To him, the prosperity of the Four Spirits Sect had nothing to do with the Deep Space's favor. It was all simply blind luck!</p>

  <p>This was why the Snake Spirit King decided to take matters into his own hands. He thought that if the Four Spirits Sect disappeared from the main world, more powerful races would rise and take their places.</p>

  <p>His plan was clear, thorough, and well-thought-out. He did what he could to achieve his vision, and all was going according to his plan.</p>

  <p>However, if there was anything he failed to take into consideration, it would be Sheehan's personality.</p>

  <p>The way the Snake Spirit King saw it, Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King was the most restrained one among the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect him to be so stubborn.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King put an end to the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan decided to put an end to the Snake Spirit King's plan.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this bothered him deeply, having to remember how someone planned to destroy something he had spent so much time and effort on.</p>

  <p>He simply could not understand why Sheehan was so stubborn, why he could not simply let things go according to the plan. He even resisted against him after he died.</p>

  <p>"Whatever happens, we cannot let those weaklings from the main world get in our way. We have to make our move," the Snake Spirit King said, his drive for succeeding in his plans becoming fiercer.</p>

  <p>"But it is not yet time to take action," Sewell worriedly reminded the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King disagreed. "There is no better time than now.</p>

  <p>Although Sheehan is not awake, those birds are incredibly intelligent. It will only be a matter of time before they recognize the direction of our plan. For now, what we need to focus on is the Monkey Spirit King, who has already awakened from his sleep. We need to carry out our plan ahead of schedule. Tell the others," the Snake Spirit King said.</p>

  <p>If they followed their original plan, they would have to stay in the chaos for a longer period.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King and his men initially didn't pay attention to the rounds of chaos.</p>

  <p>They did not take the ruling civilizations into account simply because they thought the civilizations wouldn't even be a bother. They thought they wouldn't even make a scratch in their plans.</p>

  <p>However, unexpectedly, the Bird Spirit Sect became involved. Thus, the Snake Spirit King was forced to act quickly, changing his strategy.</p>

  <p>This led him into choosing the Purge Way, which would lead to zero rounds of Chaos, and all went according to his expectations again.</p>

  <p>But to the agony of the Snake Spirit King, another disruption was about to happen.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian rested his back against the side of the stair. He did his best to catch his breath, while his heart attempted to steady itself. His arms and legs had become so exhausted to the point of being numb, but he had to pick himself up again. He could not allow himself to faint.</p>

  <p>When the spiral awl floated in front of the Snake Spirit King's face, he had a hunch that what was to come next could not be good, and he was right.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King's eyes began to blaze with a golden light, he knew he had to look away from his direction to protect himself.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was unable to protect himself from making eye contact with the Snake Spirit King. Moments ago, he just took a step back in a panic, losing his balance.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the ray of dark light slip through his fingers, too, which saved his life.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a life and death situation!</p>

  <p>'That was too close.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King. I just saw the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>I almost died just about now!'</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's thoughts came flooding into his head in heavy torrents. He needed more than a while to calm down.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure if I can continue with this. I am too weak, too unready. If Father or Master Ziya were here instead of me, they would do so much better in facing the Snake Spirit King!' Luo Nian thought to himself, resisting the frustration he had felt.</p>

  <p>"How dare you try to take my life!" Luo Nian screamed. "I'll destroy your precious Other Shore Tokens!" he continued.</p>

  <p>With no hesitation, he stretched his hand out. He curled his fingers around the black stone, grabbing it.</p>

  <p>In the past, he easily removed the black stones with a single pull; however, with this stone, no matter how hard he pulled, he couldn't remove it!</p>

  <p>"Damn it..." he said. It was becoming more difficult with the sweat dripping down his forehead blurring his vision.</p>

  <p>He tried other methods to grab the stone, but none of them worked.</p>

  <p>As his mind and body grew more tired, it became more and more difficult to accomplish his mission. The black stair and the black stone were too difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>After a few more tries, Luo Nian, in pure exhaustion, finally gave up.</p>

  <p>He rested his body after a long time of struggling, not daring to touch another ray of dark light.</p>

  <p>'If the Snake Spirit King is around the Other Shore Tokens, I would be in serious trouble, especially if I make eye-contact with him. I can only imagine how harsh the punishment would be, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He decided to completely leave the dark rays of light alone and headed towards the top of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>As he was climbing his way to the top, he couldn't help but think of the Four Spirits Sect, how they built these gigantic pillars.</p>

  <p>His feet finally landed on the top of the holy pillar. When he was there, he discovered he was standing on a round platform, which measured about ten thousand feet wide! In the middle of the platform was a relief sculpture of a giant snake, which seemed almost life-like.</p>

  <p>He took a quick look at it, only to realize that he was face-to-face with the relief sculpture of the Snake Spirit King.</p>
