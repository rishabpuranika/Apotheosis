<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3847 Cut The Ship </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Atop the enormous flying ships stood all the mighty Holy Soul Realm warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>They all felt desperate and miserable when they realized that Xuanyuan had personally come.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden, and the others, in particular, were immensely shocked and upset.</p>

  <p>This time, three flying ships came over. The words "Bearing race" were engraved on the ship in the middle, the words "Divine Farmer race" were engraved on the ship at the left, and the words "New Moon race" were engraved on the ship at the right. It was likely that both Divine Farmer and Mahoney had come.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Xuanyuan looked down at the flying ships below. He shook his long sleeve and said, "Go ahead. I know you can't wait."</p>

  <p>A thin figure popped out from behind him. He was the black-haired teenager, Usman.</p>

  <p>A hint of madness flashed in his eyes. As soon as he jumped off, he rushed towards a gigantic flying ship like an arrow.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tear this ship apart!"</p>

  <p>For some reason, he looked oddly excited, and his heart hammered in his chest.</p>

  <p>Although he could previously kill people at will, those he had fought before were people the Ji Clan had selected. Once they fought to a certain extent, they were forced to fall asleep, and Usman felt that it wasn't exciting at all.</p>

  <p>Now, he finally had the chance to kill on his own accord.</p>

  <p>He flew directly towards the giant flying ship and sensed a large number of people's breaths in it. To tear the flying ship apart was naturally the most efficient way to kill them.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Pearce screamed.</p>

  <p>His face darkened, and he froze as if the frost had enveloped him.</p>

  <p>Then, his right hand shook violently, and a handful of blood mist gushed out of his right arm. The blood mist condensed quickly and turned into a long sword.</p>

  <p>"God-detaining Sword! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The sword moved so swiftly in zigzag motions, and then it slashed at Usman's front.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>There seemed to be only the giant flying ship in Usman's eyes. As Pearce went all-out with his sword attack, he did not dodge. Instead, he withstood the strike with his physical body.</p>

  <p>The powerful sword radiance left a mark on Usman's body, but the mark only lasted for a few seconds before it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"This young man isn't at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>But he can withstand my full blow!</p>

  <p>How is that possible?" said Pearce.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his eyes!</p>

  <p>If Usman was at the Chaotic Source Realm, then it was understandable that he could block his sword strike, but he was not! The sword radiance clearly left a trace just now, but it disappeared quickly.</p>

  <p>How could someone who wasn't at the Chaotic Source Realm withstand his blow?</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt that the world had gotten even more mysterious. Some young men who appeared out of nowhere looked quite exceptional, and their strengths were simply beyond his imagination. Luo Zheng and Usman who was in front of him, were included.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!"</p>

  <p>Just then, three evil eyes floated out of Auden's body and released countless sharp swords.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The sharp swords stabbed Usman's body, but their effect was just the same as Pearce's attack. They left multiple scars on Usman, but they were small, shallow, and healed immediately.</p>

  <p>"You can never pass through!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>At that point, Winchell, Athemar, Goran, and the others also joined the fight. All of them had attacked Usman with all their might, but the results were the same. They couldn't stop him at all.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Usman crashed hard against the side of the giant flying ship.</p>

  <p>The whole giant flying ship shook violently, and the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace inside also tumbled due to the sudden movement.</p>

  <p>The golden light around the flying ship exploded, and the arrays on its surface were damaged. At the same time, a large crack began to spread on the ship. Then, the ship tore with a loud cracking sound.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Light shone inside the ship through the cracks. The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace inside the cabin blanched with fear. They all thought that they would be safe inside the flying ship, but they never expected for such a disaster to happen.</p>

  <p>Beads of sweat rolled down their temples. They saw through the crack that there was a boy in his teens outside the ship.</p>

  <p>Even though the boy was just a teen, no one dared to come forward!</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was about to retreat, a quick figure already dashed towards the crack.</p>

  <p>It was Li Bianxue whose long legs tapped lightly on the ground, and she left a shadow every time she touched the floor.</p>

  <p>When she was near Usman, she lifted the long sword and shook her right hand at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Chill Rope!"</p>

  <p>In a split second, a rope wrapped around Usman.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>After the rope had bound his body, it turned into a mark and appeared on his neck.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" Li Bianxue shouted and swung her sword at him.</p>

  <p>Her sword strike had the power of eighteen thousand divine megatons!</p>

  <p>Usman's excitement only increased as he stared at Li Bianxue's angry face. Then, he stretched out his hand and casually tried to grab Li Bianxue's sword.</p>

  <p>Eighteen thousand divine megatons of power was indeed not enough to defeat him.</p>

  <p>After Pearce and the other mighty warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had attacked him, he was still unharmed.</p>

  <p>However, he was slightly shocked when he touched Li Bianxue's sword.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the sword's power had suddenly increased by three times and reached a total of fifty-four thousand divine megatons!</p>

  <p>His abilities allowed him to resist the power that was ten times stronger than fifty-four thousand divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>Yet, he knew nothing about the Chill Rope. While the rope secured him tightly, the power of all Li Bianxue's attacks was multiplied by three times. Of course, the sudden increase caught him off-guard.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The sword radiance hit Usman directly and pushed him out of the crack!</p>

  <p>"Li Bianxue is so remarkable!"</p>

  <p>"She threw out that young man with a single sword strike! No wonder she's a Holy Soul Realm warrior!"</p>

  <p>"In the Land of Sword Grief, Li Bianxue has always been..."</p>

  <p>Naturally, many disciples were ecstatic as they watched and showered Li Bianxue with various praises.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Li Bianxue only frowned as she gripped her sword. She wasn't complacent at all. She attacked Usman with almost all her might, but why was he unharmed?</p>

  <p>Of course, she didn't see that Pearce and the others had already attacked Usman together before.</p>

  <p>While everyone continued to praise her, two more loud sounds came from the ship.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>The first sound came from the outer shell, and the second sound came from the deck under everyone's feet. The next moment, Usman appeared in the cabin.</p>

  <p>He stroked his chin and gazed at Li Bianxue with a playful smile. Then he mused, "I won't kill you yet. I'll tear down this ship first and then play with you..."</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Even in the face of an invincible opponent, Li Bianxue wasn't afraid at all. She had always focused on cultivating the sword skill as a diligent disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. She had done her best to improve, and little by little became so powerful.</p>

  <p>After that, a long sword followed behind Usman like a shadow.</p>

  <p>"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's sword radiance continuously struck Usman like flowing water.</p>

  <p>In turn, Usman withstood all her attacks with his physical body and kept retreating at the same time.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, however, he repeatedly flipped his hands and made all sorts of strange patterns. Every time he launched a palm strike, it left a weird print in the air.</p>

  <p>He retreated from the left side of the cabin to the right side, and Li Bianxue slashed him about forty times.</p>

  <p>She still used her full strength for each sword strike, but she couldn't hurt Usman.</p>

  <p>"Have you finished attacking me? If you're done doing that, get out of the way. This route is very dangerous!" Usman warned.</p>

  <p>He made a gesture and pointed towards the route where he had retreated.</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, he twisted his hands and formed a pattern. Then, the prints he left along the way lit up, and a large blade appeared.</p>

  <p>The blade the space had formed immediately spread out.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Everything happened so quickly. It was as if an invisible blade moved past and cut the flying ship in two with a crisp sound.</p>
