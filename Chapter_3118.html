<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3118 The Third Illusory Projection </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Shade Stone has been absorbed?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>He knew his body was capable of absorbing flames. It had happened many times before.</p>

  <p>But it had never swallowed any real objects!</p>

  <p>Potentially, the Shade Stone could be used to forge the Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>Alas, Luo Zheng was at a loss. However, before he could think about the consequences, he heard a loud crack from behind him. Crack!</p>

  <p>The atmosphere seemed to be ripping, and from the cracks Phoenix emerged. She was now not more than thirty feet away from him.</p>

  <p>"How... How long can you resist?" She was genuinely curious.</p>

  <p>The grade of the divine flames she had released was much higher than that of Bella's and Mary's. But even so, Luo Zheng seemed to remain unharmed, continuing to flee as he was on fire.</p>

  <p>"Let go of me, and I'll tell you," Luo Zheng replied slyly.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think I'd do that?" Phoenix smiled without a trace of malice. "If you are willing to follow me back to the Divine Lair, I promise I won't kill you."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think I'd do that?" Luo Zheng threw the question back at her.</p>

  <p>While he knew that Phoenix was actually speaking truthfully, if Phoenix brought him back to the Divine Lair, then everything he had been trying to hide for so long would be exposed.</p>

  <p>If he leaked the secrets of the divine land, the consequences would be worse than being killed.</p>

  <p>"But it's not up to you," Phoenix answered indifferently.</p>

  <p>She gently stretched her hands towards him, and a golden ball materialized above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression darkened. He sensed something different about this golden orb. It felt more powerful than the others.</p>

  <p>It was the same one used to destroy the four Arrays of Innumerable Swords.</p>

  <p>The force within the golden ball wasn't something he could take lightly.</p>

  <p>Would his journey to the Source World end now?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's resolve remained the same. He would rather die than be taken away by this demon!</p>

  <p>With a slight nod, Luo Zheng knew what he had to do.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He immediately extracted the power of the Other Shore Token. If he was going to die, he might as well put up a fight!</p>

  <p>With the power of the Other Shore Token, his aura strengthened tenfold.</p>

  <p>"You're overestimating yourself," Phoenix remarked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Little did she know that Luo Zheng was using not only the power of the Other Shore Token, but also the power of his body, the power of the Nine Divine Stars, and the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>He was gathering all the power available to him.</p>

  <p>Not sparing a moment, he didn't even bother to summon his sword. In the blink of an eye, he leapt upwards to strike Phoenix's Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng unleashed all that pent up power, the small, golden orb that was hovering above his head exploded into glittering shards.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a searing sensation on his forehead; the mark of the Exhausting Power was above his head.</p>

  <p>"The Exhausting Power!"</p>

  <p>This Latent token could only be activated if he simultaneously released all the power contained in his body.</p>

  <p>Then it would make him even stronger.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was extremely taxing, so he had never risked it before, not even during his battle with Nicholas in the divine land.</p>

  <p>All of his powers combined added up to over one hundred Jun.</p>

  <p>Once the mark of the Exhausting Power appeared, he felt incredible energy surge from within him, increasing his force fivefold.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred Jun!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, it seemed time stood still.</p>

  <p>Phoenix looked at the powerful figure before her in horror.</p>

  <p>For the first time, she actually felt threatened! 'How can this be? He's only just reached the Other Shore Realm!' she wondered internally.</p>

  <p>"It's really interesting," she spoke aloud. "Is it a Latent token created by using the Divine Pulse Deadwood? This doesn't look like the style of the Taiyi Heaven Palace..." Phoenix felt mixed emotions. While she did feel a sense of threat, her curiosity overcame her.</p>

  <p>The Divine Pulse Deadwood was a special Other Shore Token. The user had to continuously exert themselves until they were exhausted. Then, the Divine Pulse Deadwood would give them a stronger force, which was usually two or three times more than all the power of the user. The exact amount was dependent on the grade of the Divine Pulse Deadwood used.</p>

  <p>Using a Latent token only, Luo Zheng had created a force which was five times stronger. Phoenix was amazed.</p>

  <p>If what Phoenix postulated was true, then it was possible he was as strong as her!</p>

  <p>However, even though Luo Zheng had managed to muster this much power, he was still unable to escape from Phoenix.</p>

  <p>She was still on a higher cultivation level than him. If Luo Zheng was on her level, he could've collected enough power to destroy her Illusory Projection altogether.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he had just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>But still, Phoenix took a cautious step back, her lips trembling slightly, as the power from the golden ball rained down upon Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, even before the power had barely touched him, another brown ball suddenly appeared above his head. The next thing Phoenix knew was the ball shattered too.</p>

  <p>It was another Latent token, the Wind Cloud Escape.</p>

  <p>"How does he have two Latent Theurgies?" Phoenix couldn't believe her eyes.</p>

  <p>Was this man a biological son of Eastern Emperor Taiyi?</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>A strong wind violently pushed her, bringing her back to reality. The fierce fight was still going on!</p>

  <p>White fog started to rise from the surface of Luo Zheng's body as though he were steaming.</p>

  <p>Even though he wasn't using the Grand Teleportation, his speed was incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, covered from head to toe in the white fog, couldn't feel how fast he was flying.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Realizing that Luo Zheng was escaping, Phoenix cursed under her breath.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had many tricks up his sleeve. Phoenix knew that if he had the opportunity to cultivate more, he would someday grow to be invincible.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had the Shade Stone. There was no way Phoenix could let him go.</p>

  <p>"Disappear!"</p>

  <p>Taking one last glance at the direction of the Wind Cloud Escape, she withdrew her Illusory Projection and then vanished.</p>

  <p>The Divine Lair was like an endless day, with the sun shining radiantly.</p>

  <p>Countless Jin Wu flew in a formation that resembled rivers and valleys, circling the lair nonstop.</p>

  <p>Positioned at the very center of the Divine Lair, on a raised platform, was a massive golden throne. Sitting on the throne was a gloomy figure with large, golden wings.</p>

  <p>The winged figure's eyes fluttered open and she frowned. Phoenix had just withdrawn from the Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>"Anna," she said in a serious tone to the woman who sat at the foot of the throne, "I'm going to perform the third Illusory Projection." Phoenix couldn't hide the frustration in her voice.</p>

  <p>Anna looked at Phoenix in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Master Phoenix," she said cautiously, "if you use the Illusory Projection for the third time so soon, your strength will decrease by half again!"</p>

  <p>The Illusory Projection was not limited by the distance or the space. It was usually a forbidden skill of the Truth of Void Destruction because it expended too much power to use.</p>

  <p>Anna was confused. If Phoenix was facing a powerful enemy, it was useless to use the Illusory Projection for the third time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if she was dealing with a weak enemy, she should have just killed the enemy when she used the second Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>"Do as I say," Phoenix commanded coldly.</p>

  <p>There was no way she'd admit to Anna that some human boy who had just reached the Other Shore Realm had managed to escape from her.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the moment the Wind Cloud Escape was activated, she had planted a mark on Luo Zheng's body. With it, he shouldn't be able to escape, not this time.</p>
