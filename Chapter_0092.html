<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"But that guy is half-step into the nature level. You will be in an unfavorable position!" said Tank Yang anxiously.</p>

  <p>Sun Zhao nodded in agreement and said, "Yes, Tank is right. Luo Luo Zheng, this fight will be unfair for you."</p>

  <p>Martin wanted to stop Luo Luo Zheng as soon as he heard what they had said. He knew of Wu's strength. Wu was one of the best among the soldiers who were half-step into the nature level. Luo Luo Zheng would be at a disadvantage if he fought with him.</p>

  <p>But before Martin could stand up, Roger put a hand on his shoulder, shook his head in disapproval, and said, "Let Luo Luo Zheng make the choice. We have to believe in his abilities. After all, he joined the Imperial Army to fight the blade locusts with the soldiers. He needs to prove his worth to them."</p>

  <p>"But..." Martin thought over what Roger had said. However, he remained unconvinced. He wanted to say more, but before he could, Roger interrupted him again. Roger murmured, "I think Luo Luo Zheng is extraordinary even though he is at the marrow refining level."</p>

  <p>After all, Roger Meng was one of top disciples in the nature level, and so his foresight naturally differed from others.</p>

  <p>Once Roger showed confidence in Luo Zheng's abilities, Martin had no reason to try and dissuade Luo Luo Zheng. Although he decided to keep quiet, his hesitance was reflected in his expression. Wu didn't care as much about Luo Zheng's reputation.</p>

  <p>"Haha. In spite of his inferior strength, this guy is brave enough to accept my challenge. Buddies, come here. Let's move these tables and chairs so that some space can be made for the fight!" Wu yelled.</p>

  <p>The sounds of shuffling feet and scraping chairs filled the tavern as the other soldiers positioned themselves so that they could watch the fight.</p>

  <p>Tavern brawls were common between soldiers at Dragon Fort. The waiters who had been watching the argument hurriedly moved the tables and chairs away. At last, a large space was cleared.</p>

  <p>Wu stood in the center of the space. A grin spread on his lips as he gestured at Luo Luo Zheng before saying, "Brat, come here!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. The gentle look in his eyes transformed into a keenness, as though he was able to see everyone's true nature despite their pretenses.</p>

  <p>With each step Luo Luo Zheng took, his demeanor changed.</p>

  <p>His soul was far more powerful than an ordinary person's. Hence, Luo Luo Zheng naturally looked mighty.</p>

  <p>He became mightier every step he moved forward. After taking seven steps forward, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have turned into another person. He looked like a domineering devil with terrifying strength who had just finished his refinement in the purgatory.</p>

  <p>By now, Luo Zheng's soul still didn't have intent. If he had, it would have been possible for Luo Luo Zheng to hurt the bystanders by the strength from his soul alone.</p>

  <p>As soon as the bystanders felt Luo Zheng's power, surprise and shock were reflected on their faces.</p>

  <p>Even Roger was astounded.</p>

  <p>When Roger saw how skillfully and proficiently Luo Luo Zheng had fought with the strong man Gordon at the Bluesky Parking Ground, he concluded that Luo Luo Zheng was more powerful than he appeared.</p>

  <p>But now Roger, who was very skilled at the nature level, was also scared by Luo Zheng's mighty strength.</p>

  <p>'This guy is only at the marrow refining level, but he is more than what he seems. How many skills is he concealing?' thought Roger.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Wu felt foolish. The domineering strength sensed by others was only a portion of the strength exuded from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>When this force radiated by Luo Luo Zheng attacked him, Wu felt as if he had gotten stuck in mire. Even the air around him seemed to have stagnated.</p>

  <p>Wu moaned and groaned as he felt the pressure of Luo Zheng's domineering strength. He already knew that Cloud Sect disciples were not weak. But Luo Luo Zheng had just reached the marrow refining level.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that a person at the marrow refining level could be so powerful.</p>

  <p>'Has he cultivated some skills to enhance his strength? Or perhaps his actual strength is very mediocre and not so domineering as it appears?'</p>

  <p>As this thought came to his mind, Wu gritted his teeth and decided to use his greatest advantage, power, against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A person's power was associated with his level regardless of the skills he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>The higher a person's level, the fewer the impurities inside his body, and thus, the greater the person's power.</p>

  <p>It was beyond doubt that Wu's power was greater than Luo Zheng's since Wu was a half-step into the nature level while Luo Luo Zheng was still at the marrow refining level.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Giant Ape Iron Fist that Wu had been cultivating could double his power. At the same level, very few people were more powerful than Wu.</p>

  <p>Thinking of all this, Wu felt more confident. He mobilized all his power and fiercely swung his fist at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Puff!" A muffled noise was heard.</p>

  <p>Despite the strength used by Wu, Luo Luo Zheng used only his palm to defend himself. He caught Wu's fist mid-air and held it tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>At first, Wu was astonished by the block. When he regained his composure, Wu tried to direct his strength to his arm. He wanted to see if he could shake Luo Zheng's hold on his fist.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng remained undaunted. He stood calmly with Wu's fist secured firmly in his.</p>

  <p>Wu tried hard to push his fist forward, but he couldn't budge Luo Zheng's hold.</p>

  <p>Then, he attempted to pull his fist out of Luo Zheng's hand but failed at that as well.</p>

  <p>Drops of sweat collected on Wu's forehead. He had exerted himself so much that his face and neck had turned dark red. In the current situation, Wu found himself in a dilemma. He could neither advance nor retreat.</p>

  <p>A weaker cultivator had just defeated him.</p>

  <p>All the bystanders inside the tavern were taken aback when they saw this incredible scene.</p>

  <p>Since they were his battle companions, they knew of Wu's strength.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected that Luo Luo Zheng, who was only at the marrow refining level, would be able to grab Wu's fist with a single hand.</p>

  <p>This was not an ordinary feat. Even Martin, who had reached the nature level, couldn't do that. This indicated that Luo Luo Zheng was more powerful than Wu.</p>

  <p>What others didn't know was that Luo Luo Zheng had woken up four dragon scales, and was hence almost as powerful as a strong man at the nature level.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Wu couldn't shake off his grip, Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath. Soon afterward, he swung his arm and pushed Wu back.</p>

  <p>Wu's eyes widened with surprise and fear when he felt Luo Zheng's power flowing through his arms. Before he could process what had happened, Wu found himself flying backward. He crashed through several rows of tables and chairs before colliding with a wooden cabinet. All the furniture Wu had been hurled through now lay on the floor in a pile of shattered wood. At last, Wu collided with the wall before falling to the floor in a motionless heap.</p>
