<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2702 Unexpected Discovery (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Gusts of air whistled past the nine top-rank True Gods who stood in the air in the center of the forest.</p>

  <p>Various streams of internal momentum that were deep or shallow gathered from all directions and closely connected with the nine top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Their clan thrived for many generations and had long inhabited the Wind Wood Region.</p>

  <p>During the remote ages, it was considered a big clan and it even had two Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But when the time came to compete for the qualification to become a Holy Being, the two Demi-holy Beings of their clan perished in the Mountain of Holy Beings along with many others.</p>

  <p>Ever since those deaths, everyone couldn't help but notice that their clan began to decline...</p>

  <p>It got even worse when the only consummate True God the clan had died in the last divine era. Their clan declined faster.</p>

  <p>It was bad enough that they lost the protection of their consummate True God, and now, they were about to lose even the two Godly Way Tablets they relied on for a living.</p>

  <p>Many clans coveted the Godly Way Tablets but none wanted it more than the Mo Clan, a second tier from the Wind Wood Region. They attacked the clan time and time again and came back stronger each time.</p>

  <p>Even though their clan no longer had the same power they wielded before, the Demi-holy Beings left them with the Cyan Tree Array. If thousands of people from their large clan cooperated at once, they could even put up a decent fight against a consummate True God!</p>

  <p>Even though they used to be so confident about their ability to defend the Godly Way Tablets, their anxiety shot up when they heard that the Mo Clan went to the Soft Light Region and brought back a powerful master to help them. They all banded together and lurked in advance to wait for the arrival of their new formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>It was just coincidence that Zheng broke in when they were terrified and ready to snap at the slightest tension. All of them mistook him for the powerful master sent by the Mo Clan.</p>

  <p>The nine top-rank True Gods rushed to form the array and they hurried even more when they felt a space fluctuation coming towards them.</p>

  <p>All their faces were scrunched up in concentration when the expression of the True God at the helm changed. "Damn it!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the words left the old man's lips, Zheng's figure appeared in front of them faster than their eyes could follow.</p>

  <p>"Move the wood!"</p>

  <p>"Magic wood!"</p>

  <p>"Condense..."</p>

  <p>Although the nine top-rank True Gods moved quickly and did their best to move faster, Zheng was even quicker than their best.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Tree Array was far from finished when Zheng rushed like a ghost in front of the old man.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng only lightly smacked the old man's shoulder and yet the old man felt like there was a burning fire in his throat. The world spun into a blur around him before he shakily dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Tree Array wavered and flickered with the loss of the old man who headed the others. How would the array be formed without him?</p>

  <p>The other top-rank True Gods gave everything they had as they scampered to save the collapsing array.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't give them the chance to regroup.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>It was only because that Zheng knew they mistook him for someone else that he wouldn't kill them. He wasn't that merciless but neither was he charitable enough to not strike back when attacked.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved swiftly in quick flashes and smashed the top-rank True Gods into the ground one after another.</p>

  <p>When the last top-rank True God dropped to his knees, the entire array finally collapsed.</p>

  <p>Blood dripped past the lips of the nine True Gods as they shook while lying on the ground, all of them desperately glaring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man turned deathly pale as he roamed his eyes through all the fallen True Gods and knew that it was all over. "Mo Clan... How could a second tier clan manage to ask help from such a powerful master? This is the heavens' will that our Cyan Tree Clan will die today!"</p>

  <p>Even though they called themselves the Cyan Tree Clan, they were actually formed by various big clans. Their combined clan prospered because of the two Godly Way Tablets, and even the two Demi-holy Beings specialized in cultivating Cyan Wood Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods stayed silent as they stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was meaningless even if they screamed their throats hoarse and fought to the death in front of such a powerful master.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about the Mo Clan." Zheng kept his eyes on the old man as he spoke and tried to put as much sincerity as he could in his words.</p>

  <p>The old man's face crumpled as shock filled him.</p>

  <p>When no one moved despite of his explanation, Zheng added, "I'm just a passer-by. I just wanted to comprehend the Godly Ways on these tablets.</p>

  <p>You started the fight so I had to fight back."</p>

  <p>As the words finally sunk in, the nine top-rank True Gods' jaws dropped as they stared at Zheng in a mix of astonishment, shock, and confusion.</p>

  <p>There were very few consummate True Gods in the divine land and since the Mo Clan spread the word that they had a powerful master to help them in their attack, it was natural that they assumed that Zheng was the master when he happened to appear here.</p>

  <p>"You... you... Are you really not sent by the Mo Clan?" The old man's eyes wavered and he looked as if he wanted to cry.</p>

  <p>"I'm not."</p>

  <p>The nonchalant reply had the True Gods of the Cyan Tree Clan let out a sigh of relief despite their sad faces.</p>

  <p>Even if they tried their best, they still wouldn't be able to deal with the Mo Clan. Now that all of them had spent their energy in fighting Zheng, how would they handle the powerful master when he or she came?</p>
