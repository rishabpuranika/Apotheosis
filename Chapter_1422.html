<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1422 Jevan Shen (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden burst of power in the sword attack which Luo Zheng unleashed indeed alarmed Jevan Shen.</p>

  <p>Jevan didn't think the sword strike was that powerful at first. In fact, because there was a considerable distance between them, he had yet to witness the full power of Zheng's sword strike with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>But, he did detect a very unique intention from the Mu Ning emitted by the sword.</p>

  <p>That was also why he had come looking for them. He even searched and went all the way to the Bright Sky City for the source of the sword strike.</p>

  <p>By the time he arrived at the Bright Sky City, he saw a mist of blood shaping in the form of a human rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>Jevan glanced over indifferently with his brows knitted, "Julian? What's wrong? What made you like this?"</p>

  <p>Jevan was in charge of over a thousand cities, and only thirty of them were under the control of the warriors who had ascended from the Lower World. Julian was one of the city lords whom Jevan happened to know well.</p>

  <p>"S...sir... My body was destroyed by a brat. He has turned me into this, a blood shadow of my own self!" The lord of the Bright Sky City informed Jevan in a dejected tone. Suddenly, a gleam of hope flickered in his eyes,</p>

  <p>"But sir, that punk had a piece of treasure in his possession. I guess he hasn't left the Bright Sky City yet."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" A strange look took over Jevan's face. 'How could someone in possession of a treasure dare to seek trouble in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place?' The recklessness confused Jevan.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I will take you there right away!" offered Julian hastily. Without further ado, Julian led the way with Jevan followed him closely. Since Julian's physical body was destroyed, it was impossible for him to covet Zheng's Heavenly Phoenix Horse or the first-rank divine weapon anymore.</p>

  <p>However, if he were to help Jevan attain these treasures, he might benefit more from him later.</p>

  <p>At the same time across the city, Freya was on the Heavenly Phoenix Horse with Luo Zheng. She was gazing at Luo Zheng with admiration. During this short period of time, he had slain the lord of the Bright Sky City, before proceeding to destroy no-fly ban of the city. She didn't even know how to comment on the whole thing. She stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>'What on earth had Luo Zheng come across in the past year?</p>

  <p>Could the resources in the Upper World be so good? Is that the real reason why he has become so strong after he has cultivated at the Spiritual Force Sacred Place for a year?</p>

  <p>It is absolutely impossible!' Freya dismissed the thought the moment it entered her mind. She was just trying to understand how Luo Zheng had acquired enough power to kill a Spirit Supreme Realm master.</p>

  <p>Because she had been in the Bright Sky City for so long, she hadn't really had the chance to understand the Upper World in detail. Her uncle, who had been in the Upper World for many years, was slain by a single strike from Luo Zheng. Being the lord of a city, her uncle's talent was higher than average. So, it was quite an impressive feat on Zheng's part. This simple kill had convinced Freya that this kind of power couldn't be simply measured by one's length of stay in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>She just couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng could have boosted his strength so quickly.</p>

  <p>If she knew that he had traveled across more than a thousand supreme worlds before returning to this city, she wouldn't be asking such a question. It was far beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>Riding the Heavenly Phoenix Horse together, Luo Zheng was completely unaware of the fact that Freya's thoughts were running wild about him.</p>

  <p>He didn't feel a thing. In fact, he was not entirely satisfied with the sword attack he had just executed. There was even a hint of a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew that even if the Gods-intimidating Strike didn't require the accumulation of strength, he still needed to adjust his state of mind and shut down all his emotions completely when executing the strike. Only by doing this would he ensure that the Gods-intimidating Strike's power reached its climax.</p>

  <p>However, it was easier said than done. No matter how hard he tried, the moment he performed the Gods-intimidating Strike and slashed his sword, his focus shattered.</p>

  <p>'If a stone were to execute the Gods-intimidating Strike, it would be able to achieve 100 percent perfect result, ' he thought to himself sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was neither a stone, nor a True God. He was just a living human. A human being could never shut down all of his emotions.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Luo Zheng sighed to himself. Then, a smile went on his face as he spoke softly at Freya.</p>

  <p>She nodded slightly in response, her eyes shining with respect as she looked at him.</p>

  <p>When Freya had just ascended, she always gave off an air of superiority to people because unlike other warriors, who ascended without any help or backing from any authority, she had the support of the lord of this city.</p>

  <p>Now that she thought about it, she shouldn't have been in such a rush to go to her uncle. It turned out that Luo Zheng was much more trustworthy than her own uncle.</p>

  <p>Now she almost revered Luo Zheng, and it seemed to her that she couldn't behave casually around him anymore.</p>

  <p>While both of them were busy with their own thoughts and concerns, two streaks of light suddenly shot out from the horizon in their direction.</p>

  <p>Looking carefully at the people rushing towards them, Freya tensed up!</p>

  <p>She recognized the blood mist in the form of a human in front of her as her uncle. She tried to see through the cultivation base of the martial artist following him, but she couldn't.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what should we do now?" Luo Zheng was a trustworthy partner to her now. So she lightly tilted his body and tried to hide behind him without giving it much thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scanned the two men standing in front of them. To everyone's surprise, a faint smile appeared on his face. He seemed to have sensed Freya's nervousness, so he moved toward Freya and tried to comfort her with a soothing voice, "It's all right; he seems to be one of my acquaintances."</p>

  <p>Following the 'blood mist lord' of the Bright Sky City, Jevan rushed to the west side of the city. Before he arrived there, he was quite confused about Julian's description of the intruder. But, when he reached and finally saw Luo Zheng with his own eyes, the questions in his mind vanished.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of Luo Zheng, Jevan raised his eyebrows and looked him up and down.</p>

  <p>There was no big change in Zheng's appearance, apparently. After breaking through to the Soul Sea Realm, Zheng's cultivation base had advanced by leaps and bounds. It seemed to Jevan that his temperament had become even more powerful. This made him somewhat suspicious for a moment.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng should have been taken away by the palace leader of the Mist Palace. He shouldn't be here! Even if he did escape the Mist Palace, why on earth is he here at the Spiritual Force Sacred Place all by himself?'</p>

  <p>Jevan thought to himself. In fact, for a moment, he wasn't sure whether the young man next to him was Luo Zheng or not!</p>
