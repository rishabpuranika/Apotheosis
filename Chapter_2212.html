  <p>
</p>

  <p>An hour had passed as Luo Luo Zheng waited by the sea.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a small black dot appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>As it got closer, the dot became bigger. Luo Luo Zheng soon realized that the dot was in fact a boat sailing on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng refrained from asking Mae any more questions. So he decided to ask Master Evil through his mind. "Mae has said anyone who fell into the Time Sea would face instant death. Then how is there a boat sailing on the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>Until now, Master Evil had been silent all along in Luo Zheng's mind. He had visited the Time Sea long back and as he revisited the place again, endless thoughts were running through his mind. When he heard Luo Zheng's question, he laughed out loud. "Oh, there is a way to cross it. The materials used to make the boat are so special, that they can isolate the Time Law within the Time Sea. I personally haven't been to any of the Floating Islands before, but as far as I know, these boats belong to a very mysterious race called the Sun Blind race. All the divine citizens of this race have never opened their eyes to see the world, as they are all blind.</p>

  <p>They have been sailing on the sea for generations."</p>

  <p>There were many legends about the Sun Blind race in the divine land, and some of them were quite staggering.</p>

  <p>It was a low-key and mysterious ancient race. Not everyone was privy to their lifestyle. As Master Evil had said, everyone in the Blind Race was blind, but this was not important. The key point was that this race had traveled on the Time Sea before all the powerful clans occupied the Time Sea, during the ancient times.</p>

  <p>Up until now, the True Gods in the divine land had little understanding about this race. Many of their customs and strange rules were often unfathomable to outsiders, because of which, many of the warriors from the wealthy clans considered them like a fly on the ointment. These powerful clans were the top forces of the divine land, and were usually domineering at an extreme level. However, they tried to avoid and even tolerated them to some extent. Because of insufficient knowledge, there were many speculations about this race from the people of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The boat was constantly floating on the Time Sea. It seemed to be sailing at a very slow pace, but in reality its speed was extremely fast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's vision could reach a thousand miles away at most. Within five minutes, the boat arrived from a thousand miles away to where Luo Luo Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>As the boat approached, Luo Luo Zheng saw that the ferryman was a strong man with crimson skin. He seemed to be blind, as his eyes were closed firmly, and his thick and powerful arms were pushing and pulling a pair of strange paddles, which seemed to be made of the backbone of some kind of gigantic fish.</p>

  <p>After the boat pulled on to the shore, the strong man stood still, while cocking his head to one side. He then asked, "Is it Mae who wants to cross the sea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is," Mae replied in a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>The man nodded and steering the boat said, "Please get on to the boat."</p>

  <p>As she turned towards Luo Luo Zheng, Mae stretched out her hands and grabbed him by the arm. They both leaped and landed on the boat.</p>

  <p>Again the ferryman stood still for a while and then asked, "Is there another person with you, Miss?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are two of us," replied Mae indifferently.</p>

  <p>The ferryman still had his eyes closed, but he was facing Luo Luo Zheng. His eyes couldn't see anything, but he seemed to have used his spiritual sense or other methods to size up Luo Luo Zheng. He didn't move for a long time.</p>

  <p>Mae frowned.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Time Sea were very particular. No one could fly in the entire area of the Time Sea, nor could anyone use spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was top-rank True Gods or consummate True Gods, everyone had to rely on these ferrymen to cross the Time Sea and usually it was a smooth process. She could not understand the ferryman's peculiar behavior today. She thought for a while and asked, "Why hasn't the boat started moving yet?"</p>

  <p>The ferryman did not speak, and continued to stay motionless in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although these ferrymen didn't have high levels of cultivation, they were indispensable in the Time Sea. The powerful clans wouldn't dare to provoke them unnecessarily. After all, the Time Sea was too dangerous.</p>

  <p>Once they got onto a boat, their lives were in the hands of ferrymen.</p>

  <p>There was no way to escape if the ferrymen capsized the boat. Just imagining about falling into the Time Sea could send shivers among the people.</p>

  <p>So Mae waited patiently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked to see the ferryman suddenly open his eyes.</p>

  <p>His eyes were pure white and devoid of pupils. It was frightening to see such a sight. Moreover, the ferryman was getting very close to Luo Luo Zheng with his face only a few inches away from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was completely baffled. He didn't understand the ferryman's close scrutiny. He was feeling uncomfortable with this ferryman standing so close to him.</p>

  <p>The ferryman suddenly said, "I won't ferry you across the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Please leave the boat now."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Why should he leave the boat?" Mae's face darkened.</p>

  <p>These ferrymen had always been mild and obedient. In the Time Sea, they were like diligent and honest servants. For countless years, they had been silently serving the major clans. Except during occasions, they never went on strike or caused any kind of delay. They were always available to render their services.</p>

  <p>What was wrong with this ferryman today?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned, but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"The reason doesn't matter. Come what may, there is no chance that I am going to ferry him." The ferryman shook his head defiantly as he retreated back to the stern of the boat. He kept the two paddles aside, indicating that if Luo Luo Zheng didn't get off the boat, he would not sail.</p>

  <p>"Our Han Clan has paid enough divine might coins to your race. I have some very serious work to accomplish on the Floating Island and yet you refuse to ferry us across?" Mae said in an agitated tone. She was getting impatient.</p>

  <p>The ferryman of the Sun Blind race still shook his head. "This Time Sea is very dangerous, so there are many taboos in our Sun Blind race. You should be aware about them."</p>

  <p>The Time Sea looked beautiful, at the same time it also looked mysterious and endless. In reality, under the gorgeous cover, it was a sea of death.</p>

  <p>Any creature that fell into the sea would be torn apart and their bodies would fall into a certain period of time.</p>

  <p>For the True Gods, the Time Sea was even more terrifying than many large forbidden lands. Those forbidden places that people talked about might be frightening, but there were still many ways that people could survive. However, if they accidentally fell into the Time Sea, there was only one end, and that was death and there was no exception.</p>

  <p>Except for the Holy Beings, any True Gods that wanted to enter the Floating Islands had to be ferried by the Sun Blind race. Only the Sun Blind race could use the boats to "conquer" the Time Sea which was full of restrictions.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, there were many strange rules prevalent in the Sun Blind race, which were passed down from generation to generation that could not be violated. These rules were known as "Four Nos".</p>

  <p>First, the Sun Blind race would not ferry at midnight or noon.</p>

  <p>Second, they would not ferry during turbulent weather. What they feared was not ordinary storms. Once a storm broke out in the Time Sea, it would be devastating to all the creatures on the sea.</p>

  <p>Third, no ferry on the Astronomical Transit Day. The Astronomical Transit Day was a grand holiday of the Sun Blind race. In this day, there was no boat on the Time Sea, and no one could pass through it.</p>

  <p>Fourth, no ferrying anyone out of fear. If there was someone on the boat that made the ferrymen afraid, they would not ferry the person.</p>

  <p>Of course Mae was aware of the rules. But still she thought for a moment and wondered, "It is neither midnight nor noon. There is no violent storm brewing in the sea. Today is not even the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>Then why won't you let him inside the boat?"</p>

  <p>"Because I'm afraid of him," the ferryman of the Sun Blind race said.</p>

  <p>"Afraid? Tianxing is just a proving godly warrior. What is the need for you to be afraid of him?" Mae asked curiously. She knew that once these guys of the Sun Blind race made up their minds, it was very difficult to convince them otherwise.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was completely confused with the ongoing situation. For the life of him, he could not understand the ferryman's despair, and he also became vigilant.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race were known to have extraordinary senses. Once his origins, or some of the flaws in himself which he even didn't know were revealed, it would be troublesome.</p>

  <p>The ferryman shook his head and said, "I'm afraid of him. His Mu Ning is not right."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Mae felt helpless.</p>

  <p>There was no way she could deal with the Sun Blind race with force. No Floating Island resident would dare to offend this mysterious race. If the ferryman refused to ferry him across, then that was the end of discussion! There was no way he would be able to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"So is there any other way for him to enter the Floating Island?" Mae asked again looking at the ferryman hopefully.</p>

  <p>In her mind, if this Sun Blind man was not willing to ferry Tianxing, the only other way would be to ask her master to personally come. The master had the ability to send Tianxing to the Floating Island, but it was too trivial a matter to ask for her presence. Moreover, Tianxing was not qualified to enjoy such a privilege.</p>

  <p>"I think my father can do the job. My father and my brother may not be afraid of him," the ferryman said.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sun Blind race were divided into various ranks.</p>

  <p>Because of their mysterious lifestyle and their seldom communication to outsiders, they all looked the same. It was very difficult to make out their difference physically. Although Mae had traveled on the Time Sea many times, she didn't really know them. Even she felt that all the Sun Blind members looked exactly the same.</p>
