  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Emperor Charm, he had already heard some news from Zheng and guessed the reason for Feng Ge's disgust towards them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he asked her who she would like to see.</p>

  <p>Among the thirty-nine statues, the only person that Feng Ge was willing to see was the statue of his father— Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>In turn, Emperor Charm transferred her to the Starry Sword Region, where she had met her "father." After that, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had even taught her a theurgy of swordsmanship before she left.</p>

  <p>But after she had departed from the starry illusion, she was still in a trance.</p>

  <p>This "Eastern Emperor Taiyi" had a better understanding of swordsmanship than her father. She didn't know if he knew about it, so she was determined to tell him about it when she could leave the Other Shore this time.</p>

  <p>Thud, thud, thud…</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the temple continued to rumble, and everything inside it began to peel off and crack!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A stone pillar in the corner of the hall exploded, but a space floated within it. Inside the space were towns and mountains, as if it had formed a world of its own. In addition, there were also people from the 77th civilization.</p>

  <p>It turned out that after the humans had decreased most of their forces, the majority of the humans on the Other Shore entered hidden spaces.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, the space flew to the book.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Another stone pillar shattered, and the space hidden inside it rushed into the book too.</p>

  <p>After eighteen stone pillars were destroyed in a row, eighteen spaces showed up. It seemed the world of the human civilization was bigger than that of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>When the eighteen spaces rushed into the book, the statues also broke, and all the energy souls quickly rushed into the book as well!</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact of the humans was similar to that of the Regal Jade Civilization, but there were some key differences between them.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and all the other powerful masters had their real bodies in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Their presence now was just in the form of their energy souls, which was a bit like the form of No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Besides that group of thirty-nine people, the book had also absorbed most of the 77th civilization's possessions!</p>

  <p>On the contrary, such was not the case with the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade City was still located in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. Nevertheless, Zheng could still borrow many divine megatons of force from it through the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The big difference between the two Civilization Artifacts was because after Zheng had visited the thirty-nine heroes, he had gotten their full trust!</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish… The book was like a bottomless black hole.</p>

  <p>The huge temple continued to collapse due to the constant absorption. The whole scene looked like a process of a building being weathered by time, as its fragments quickly flowed into the book.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Zheng, Feng Ge, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were the only ones who stood there. The temple had already disappeared, and only the remnants of its foundation were left.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Feng Ge had seen the temple's foundation when they had first found the temple. Now, if it wasn't for the statue of the the Primeval Lord of Heaven nearby, Zheng would've thought that it was only a dream.</p>

  <p>"Bear it!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that point, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's statue began to weather as well.</p>

  <p>His energy soul rushed into the book, and the book floated towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the book in his hand and looked at it for a while, before he handed it to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Why?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice came from within the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Since the book was now a Civilization Artifact and was given to Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven naturally didn't want it to be in another person's hands.</p>

  <p>"My corporeal body can't bear the Other Shore Token. Only when my soul returns to the Other Shore can I bear it," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>He clearly couldn't change the rules on the Other Shore, so he could only ask Feng Ge to help him pass this Other Shore Token to his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge put the book into the Sumeru Space, they turned to leave the area.</p>

  <p>Compared to entering the Creation Myth Temple, leaving it was much easier.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng and Feng Ge were gone, the three circular areas turned into a gobi, a grassland, and a desert.</p>

  <p>In any case, Zheng had no intention of staying in Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. When everything was done, he and Feng Ge went north along the junction of the desert and the grassland.</p>

  <p>However, not long after they went a certain distance, Zheng saw a few fist-sized caves not far away. Those caves glowed with bean-sized lights. They were none other than the Extremity Mice, which were ordered about by the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng dashed forward and headed straight for those caves.</p>

  <p>When the Extremity Mice that hid in the caves saw who had come for them, they burrowed even deeper inside.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race would most likely not give up on the temple. Thus, there might be huge trouble if he let these Extremity Mice monitor their whole journey.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands and grasped on the ground. Many divine megatons of force suddenly blew up, and then slammed down heavily against the caves.</p>

  <p>Smash!</p>

  <p>All the caves below the area collapsed under the immense pressure, so these Extremity Mice naturally had a hard time escaping.</p>

  <p>The caves these Extremity Mice had dug were very complicated. If Zheng relied on his strength alone, it would be nearly impossible for him to clear all of them up.</p>

  <p>But once the caves in this area were sealed, he spread out his thunder wings, took Feng Ge in his arms, and leapt up high in the air. Finally, they flew west in the direction of the grassland, then moved towards the north.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the human woman dragged her snake tail and traveled towards the northeast. Under the guidance of the Extremity Mice, she entered a cave which was more than a shoulder wide.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the underground caves was the headquarters of the Extremity Mice.</p>

  <p>Although the Extremity Mice were intelligent creatures, it was hard to find anything pleasant in their living environment.</p>

  <p>Their place reeked of some strange and pungent smells that made her want to vomit.</p>

  <p>After they passed through the underground caves for several thousand feet, the path in front of them eventually widened.</p>

  <p>Something appeared in front of her. It was a shiny golden snake!</p>

  <p>The Nihility race had originally placed the golden snake there. After the Extremity Mice had seen Zheng and the Moon Fire Slaves earlier, they had relied on this golden snake to pass on the news for them.</p>

  <p>Just then, the woman reached out her hand and gently stroked the golden snake's head.</p>

  <p>The golden snake, which appeared to be carved out of gold, suddenly opened its eyes and stick out its tongue.</p>

  <p>Hiss, hiss…</p>

  <p>After the golden snake confirmed the woman's identity, it circled around her body.</p>

  <p>Aside from being used to convey information, the golden snake could also tell if the person who had sent the information was lying.</p>

  <p>When the snake was done circling around the woman, its head approached her and said in a strange voice, "Has the temple opened?" "It's opened..." the woman replied.</p>

  <p>"Did you see them?" the strange voice from the snake's mouth asked rather excitedly. "Yes, I did, but I was driven out," the woman answered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>A heavy silence filled the air.</p>

  <p>This time, not only did she lose a Nihility Spirit, but she also absolutely failed her mission.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>The golden snake that was wrapping around the woman suddenly shrunk and let out an ear-piercing sound.</p>

  <p>Even though this woman came from a high stage, it was hard for her to resist such a tight force, especially when her strength was subdued by this stage. At that moment, her body emitted several cracking sounds.</p>

  <p>Of course, the sound came from her bones that broke inside her body.</p>
