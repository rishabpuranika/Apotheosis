<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once the Land of Bone Tribulation was opened, the warriors had a training time of eight hundred hours. That was nearly a month.</p>

  <p>But now that only fifty hours remained, Zheng was no longer in a rush or held the same interest as before in refining the tribulation skeleton. In fact, he had been staying at the first layer on the very edge of the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Previously Zheng had successfully refined his Chaotic Source Spirits by the method of "being beaten." The rate at which they grew was astoundingly fast. It didn't take long before Zheng made his way to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>When he attempted to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits with the assistance of the blue-golden water drops in the Myriad Tribulation Storm, he was also "being beaten." But this method proved to be more effective.</p>

  <p>The tiny light dots that signified the Chaotic Source Spirits were going through the constant process of being rinsed and refined. They were as minuscule as a needle tip in size. Over and over, they extinguished and lit up, then extinguished and lit up in an endless loop. While this method kept on repeating itself, the tiny particles of light simultaneously grew.</p>

  <p>This sensation felt quite subtle. It resembled the feeling of countless seeds spreading and breaking through their roots inside his body, and slowly branching their way out. It was as if the Truth of Godly Way acted as an enzyme and sped up the process by infusing itself with them.</p>

  <p>In just half a day, the size of the light spots had more than doubled.</p>

  <p>Not only did they grow in size each passing minute, but their endurance to the power rose to a higher degree as well. With his newly acquired strength and resistance, Zheng effortlessly took a step forward and made his way onto the second layer.</p>

  <p>With this action of his, he attracted various curious eyes towards him that belonged to the creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's month-long stay on the sixteenth layer, it could be said that the first and second layers didn't prove fruitful enough for him, which was most of the reason why the Other Shore creatures failed to conclude his motives.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng didn't explain to them either. Instead, he chose to prioritize his refinement and kept all his focus on it alone. Slowly and gradually, as he moved forward, the light dots kept on growing in unison with his steps.</p>

  <p>When the light dots grew to a certain degree, Zheng began to count them carefully. They appeared to have tripled in numbers as the once two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits had now increased to six hundred.</p>

  <p>"To conclude everything I know, the two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits can absorb about ten thousand divine megatons of force. When I cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm once more, I can resist the attack of more than thirty thousand divine megatons of force only by the help of Chaotic Source Spirits."</p>

  <p>Watching the Chaotic Source Spirits' rapid growth, Zheng couldn't help but feel his heart flutter with joy.</p>

  <p>He had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation intending to cultivate a Myriad Tribulations Body. The sudden surprise of the growth of Chaotic Source Spirits came as an unexpected gain for him, so he couldn't help but feel giddy over his recent discovery.</p>

  <p>With only fifty hours remaining, Zheng moved to the third layer. Meanwhile, the tiny light dots-like Chaotic Source Spirits slowly grew till each of them manifested itself into the size of an ant from its previous form of a needle tip.</p>

  <p>When the time limit expired, the Myriad Tribulations Storm slowly subsided.</p>

  <p>Just as the storm began to soothe up, the blue Soul Interdicting Water and the golden liquid retreated, respectively. As these events unfolded, a swarm of monsters swam their way out of the surrounding walls formed by the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Ghost-claw Worms, there were also various other unknown creatures. They had varying appearances, and their figures differed from one another. Their unknown origins made them a bigger threat as they glanced the Other Shore creatures in the inner space with eyes brimming with malice.</p>

  <p>"The Myriad Tribulations Storm has stopped. Move quickly and get out of here!"</p>

  <p>"The seawater will gather up soon enough. If we fall into the sea, we will be doomed..."</p>

  <p>"Let's head up..."</p>

  <p>Since the surrounding seawater slowly squeezed itself to pave its way towards the center, the space would soon be filled, leaving them nowhere to go.</p>

  <p>Similar to the rules at Soul City, outsiders were not allowed to stay after the Land of Bone Tribulation was closed.</p>

  <p>Taking caution to the situation, Zheng lightly tapped on the bone plate with his tiptoe and flew up towards the bone stairs.</p>

  <p>As for the tribulation skeletons, they remained on the bone plates and were eventually flooded by the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng and the Other Shore creatures pushed their way out of the huge head, the jaws made clicking sound again. As if triggering something, the mouth closed up, and the head began to descend. The only thing it left to vouch for its existence was the skull that was left outside.</p>

  <p>After a good round of rinsing and refining, the Other Shore creatures felt their enmity towards Zheng dissolve. Some of them even revealed hints of high respect and goodwill towards him on their faces.</p>

  <p>However, they were increasingly curious about the kind of body refining technique Zheng had used.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng didn't let them in on any of the details. Besides, it would have been useless even if he decided to tell them.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits on the Other Shore existed in a different form from those in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits from the Other Shore were ordinary creatures who harbored average strength. Even if they were carried by someone from the Source World as an Other Shore Token of the auxiliary type, their abilities would display minimal improvements.</p>

  <p>However, in the Source World, the reproduced Chaotic Source Spirits took the form of life between the Other Shore and the Source World. They did not stray from the truth, and they could stay in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The crystals found inside the bodies of the Chaotic Source Spirits held the ability to absorb energy and resist against damage. These Other Shore creatures were unable to see the crystals lying dormant in the bodies of the Chaotic Source Spirits, and they didn't carry anything.</p>

  <p>The creatures from the Other Shore couldn't leave the Other Shore. For the next eight hundred hours, they were left with no choice but to wait it out and stay on the bone island.</p>

  <p>The member of the Sturdy Bull race wasted no time and proceeded to draw himself a peculiar array on the ground. Once it was complete, he stepped inside and sat down to concentrate on cultivating his body refining method.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the centipede found himself a hollow bone and curled up inside it to rest his eyes and sleep. His protection theurgy seemed to have drained a considerable amount of his energy. He lay there and rested to recuperate after his month-long stay in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Zheng bid his time and waited for the effect of the Soul Interdicting Water to wear off. Then, he left the Other Shore to learn about the current situation in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The past month, the Source World had undergone a few mishaps that threatened its peace, but nothing too serious. However, it seemed Libby was encountering a few issues which prevented her from going to Stage Thirty-Two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>According to her, the bones in the Sanskrit Light Stage that led to the top seemed to have been destroyed, and this kind of damage probably had something to do with the changes in the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>Having no other choice, she had to reluctantly retreat to the largest bone cavity. After this, she chose to leave the Other Shore for a short period.</p>

  <p>Libby had no one she could trust in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Helpless as she was, all she could do was wait. Maybe if Zheng were to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, she could turn the tables in her favor?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth had gained a firm foothold and strengthened her position in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had plans to summon her powerful clansmen of the Holy Soul Realm, from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. She had debriefed the news to the Oneness Sky Palace. Pearce and the others felt themselves well up with joy upon hearing this from her. Stage Thirty of the Other Shore held significance in terms of its location. If humans were to gain control of this stage, the benefits would be incalculable.</p>

  <p>However, when the strong warriors of the Holy Soul Realm attempted to rush down from Stage Thirty-two to claim the area, they encountered the same issue as Libby. There was something strangely wrong with the bones in the Sanskrit Light Stage, which prevented them from passing through it.</p>

  <p>The Holy Souls residing in Stage Thirty-two were refused access to go down. Even so, the Holy Souls currently in Stage Twenty-nine and Twenty-eight of the Other Shore were able to move up to get there. Although the Holy Souls combined from both stages weren't dominant in numbers, they were enough to lend Elizabeth a hand.</p>

  <p>During this period, the Element Spirit race had also dispatched Five-Element Slaves from the higher stage. Unfortunately for them, they were quickly obliterated by Pompeo, the bald giant.</p>

  <p>After successfully taking over the ice city, Elizabeth commanded all the Other Shore creatures in Stage Thirty to obediently submit under her rule.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had been leading the Divine Lair in the Sun Crow race, so she was experienced on how to bring others under her control through either brute force or bribery. The Other Shore creatures residing in Stage Thirty had no other choice but to pick the easier option and surrender, or they would have been asked to leave.</p>

  <p>Within a short span of a month, the once rough Stage Thirty of the Other Shore was brought to strict order and became organized under the watchful rule of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had someone else send the message to Zheng, while she herself had been staying on the Other Shore during this period of time. She was too preoccupied to leave the Other Shore.</p>
