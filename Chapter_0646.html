<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The crows were like black stains in the azure sky, flying too fast that they seemed like dark blurs. In a span of a few moments, they were already hovering above the mountain stream.</p>

  <p>Mocking laughter resounded through the valley, "Hahaha! Lady Poison-blood, it seems that someone has got ahead of you." Above the group of crows was a man donning a black ghost mask. It was hard to tell how ancient the man was. As Lady Poison-blood called him an old man, he must have been around for ages.</p>

  <p>"So what, huh? I got here way before you did, so the Dragon Soar Arena belongs to me, alone!" Lady Poison-blood remarked coldly.</p>

  <p>Raven grinned upon hearing this. "Lady Poison-blood, you are still one of the top martial arts practitioners in the Central Region. Don't be so unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"Oh? What if I am that unreasonable? Do you really think I'll be scared of you?" Lady Poison-blood stated matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>Hearing the feuding between these two powerful masters, the three Internal Elixir Realm cultivators from the Xue Clan sighed deeply. They feared that the Xue Clan might not get their fair share of the Dragon Soar Arena this time around. They only hoped that their young master would have good fortune in exploring the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>As Lady Poison-blood and Raven were in a heated exchange of insults and taunts, a roar resounded loud and clear from nearby.</p>

  <p>The intense roar rattled everyone present.</p>

  <p>A tremendous flood dragon appeared in the sky and swam towards them.</p>

  <p>"A flood dragon!" Lady Poison-blood's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't feel its life essence. This is merely a puppet!" Raven said.</p>

  <p>No one could see his exact expression with the mask concealing his face.</p>

  <p>Having heard the roar of the flood dragon, the winged dragon guarding the Dragon Soar Arena roared back, the sound like the rumble of thunder. The winged dragon seemed to utilize the roar to further manifest its immense power. There were too many masters coming here today.</p>

  <p>Even a powerful creature such as the winged dragon also got nervous and felt threatened.</p>

  <p>When the flood dragon approached closer, they saw it open its mouth.</p>

  <p>Three people were standing in the middle, with the incumbent leader of the Cloud Hall, Tia, front and center.</p>

  <p>Tia had been practicing in a secluded place for a whole month, and now the Mu Ning around her had changed substantially. It was apparent that she had already leaped to the Internal Elixir Realm from the Illuminating Soul Realm. Tia had dispersed her cultivation base nine times, and every time she had to restart from scratch. She never encountered a single bottleneck in regaining her cultivation base. The rate she improved her cultivation level was extremely fast. Within a month, she had already entered the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>"The Cloud Hall! Ning Yudie Ning! Where... did she get this flood dragon puppet?" Raven asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood, who was standing beside him, also looked at Ning Yudie Ning with admiration. As the leaders of the fourth-grade sects, they knew clear as day the significance of a flood dragon puppet to a sect. In times of conflict between sects, the summoning of a flood dragon puppet was usually the key factor in turning the tides. It was a powerful and strategic weapon to employ.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie merely chuckled and said, "Oh! So you wanna know huh? I'll tell you unless you agree that Dragon Soar Arena belongs to me."</p>

  <p>They just couldn't let Ning Yudie take the Dragon Soar Arena. All the important people present were fourth-grade sect leaders. The Dragon Soar Arena was a much coveted prize. Yudie's request definitely put the pressure on Raven and Lady Poison-blood.</p>

  <p>They dared not underestimate Ning Yudie as a simple Internal Elixir Realm cultivator. Ning Yudie had mastered the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, and they were all familiar on how incredibly powerful this technique was. As soon as she regained her original cultivation base, she would surpass them completely. Furthermore, there was an extremely powerful figure in the Cloud Hall who had her back.</p>

  <p>However, it was unlikely that Ning Yudie could take the Dragon Soar Arena that easily. The tension was thick in the air as no one wanted to give ground.</p>

  <p>Several minutes passed since Ning Yudie and her colleagues arrived, now a massive ship appeared in the sky and started barreling towards them. The way the ship moved was strange. It sailed in the sky as if in a way of teleportation, constantly shifting and leaping from one space to another.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pouted and complained out loud like a little kid, "I knew the people from Ethereal Spirit Sect would get involved!"</p>

  <p>After the ship drew to a stop, seven men flew out of the ship and descended elegantly. They were all clad in soot black robes, and their appearances and expressions were exactly the same. These were the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit.</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Ethereal Spirit Sect didn't come, but he did send the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit." Raven sighed.</p>

  <p>The seven warriors were septuplets, their souls eternally bound to each other. Although Raven could deal with any one of them in a one-on-one fight, he could never match the power of the seven combined.</p>

  <p>After the seven warriors descended from the gargantuan ship, they all bowed to Ning Yudie, Raven and Lady Poison-blood all in sync with each other. They apparently were polite and possessed good manners. As the only fifth grade sect in the Central Region, the Ethereal Spirit Sect was humble and always kept a low profile.</p>

  <p>The seven warriors stood in a neat line beside them. No one dared utter a word. But everybody knew that they also came for the Dragon Soar Arena. In any case, the most powerful sect usually didn't have to say anything. Their raw Mu Ning and strength spoke for themselves.</p>

  <p>"It's just a God-forsaken Dragon Soar Arena. Why does everyone get all nosy.." Raven said while scratching his nose under his mask.</p>

  <p>"What? Just a Dragon Soar Arena? Then what do you think you're doing here? You might as well just give up now." Lady Poison-blood felt oddly irritated.</p>

  <p>"Now, why should I give up? You want to take me on, huh?" Raven muttered with an icy tone.</p>

  <p>Landing a firm gaze at Raven, Lady Poison-blood said, "Raven, are you saying you want to start a war?"</p>

  <p>There were a lot of sects present in the Central Region, and also a lot of countries. But most of the sects overtook the countries, possessing a lot of power. If a war broke out amongst sects, it would be fiercer than the strife among countries. The war would plunge the common folk into misery and suffering as the Central Region would flow with blood.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was once in turmoil during the past war. But with the emergence of several fourth grade sects, and the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the situation soon stabilized.</p>

  <p>Raven was flustered upon hearing Lady Poison-blood's words. As a matter of fact, several fourth grade sects were desperately trying to catch up with the Ethereal Spirit Sect. With Ning Yudie accomplishing the last level of the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, she might as well lead the Cloud Hall to the fifth grade level.</p>

  <p>The fragile peace the Central Region currently enjoyed stemmed from the delicate balance among the powers within the Central Region. In fact, once the balance tipped over to one side even a fraction, a war among the sects was inevitable.</p>

  <p>After a short wait, the people from the Mysterious Luna Hall had just begun to arrive.</p>

  <p>Finally, Ning Yudie just smiled gracefully and said, "It seems that it is indeed time for us to sit down and enjoy a nice, long talk."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea what was transpiring outside. At this moment, he was just wild with joy. In the Dragon Soar Arena, Luo Zheng forged ahead, killing enemies left and right, and taking in the Lucky Light and malicious Mu Ning into his body.</p>

  <p>As the Dragon Soar Arena just came into the world, the Lucky Light it had accumulated over thousands of years constantly flew into Zheng's belly and filled the space. Luo Zheng could feel that his spirit became fuller and stronger. And his cultivation base surged along the way. When he ascended the fourth floor of the Dragon Soar Arena, he already entered the ninth grade of the nature level, only one step from the consummation of nature level.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had always had a solid foundation in martial arts. This was due to the fact that he had spent a lot of time and energy consolidating his martial arts foundation. Though he was better grounded than many common warriors, he fell behind in rising his level. But once his power erupted, his level in martial arts would rise in leaps and bounds, at the speed that no other warriors could ever hope to match.</p>

  <p>Ever since he set his mind on mastering martial arts, Luo Zheng had never been so pleased as everything had gone smoothly so far.</p>

  <p>As he ascended the Dragon Soar Arena higher and higher, the difficulty rose accordingly.</p>

  <p>When he reached the fourth floor, Luo Zheng was able to decimate his opponents with the Blood Drinking Sword. However, when he got to the fifth floor, he was astonished to see his challenge ahead - a full-on heavily armored cavalry contingent. The whole floor was packed with heavy cavalry. There might've been thousands.</p>

  <p>Facing the cavalry head-on, Luo Zheng felt restrained to get through with only his Blood-Drinking Sword. So he summoned Lily as well. With the huge sword in her hand, Lily was a born killer. Every time she swung her behemoth of a sword, it would cut a swathe through the large group of soldiers and chopped them to bits.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the malicious Mu Ning and spots of Lucky Light poured into Zheng's body and were rapidly focused on his lower body.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he breezed past the fifth floor.</p>

  <p>With no regard for anything else, Luo Zheng rushed upwards the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>After he reached the sixth floor, he found it strange that it was empty.</p>

  <p>The divine texture array of the sixth floor apparently hadn't been activated yet.</p>

  <p>'Is this the top floor, then?' Luo Zheng wondered to himself. He didn't expect this would end soon, as he hadn't gotten enough Lucky Light to improve his level. He was now at the peak of his nature level, and only with a bit more Lucky Light, he would be able to enter the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Finally we arrive at the top!" The Cyan Dragon who remained mum finally spoke.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced around to check his surroundings. He soon found a circular divine texture hanging by the sloped ceiling. He turned to the cyan dragon and said, "You still haven't told me why we're doing all this and what will happen when we conquer the top floor."</p>

  <p>At this time, the young master who was at the premium stage of the Internal Elixir Realm was rapidly catching up. If he failed to climb to the top, he'd be in great danger.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you. Now, get closer to the circular divine texture," the cyan dragon ordered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in assent, and then walked towards the sloping wall. He stopped and stood still upon reaching the oval divine texture.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stopped, a tiny flicker of soul was infused onto the divine texture. It then began to revolve slowly. Suddenly a flash of light poured forth and went directly towards Luo Zheng.</p>
