</p>

  <p>The girl could be described as perfect in every sense.</p>

  <p>But Zheng, ever so keen, noted there were still slight differences between the girl and ordinary human beings. Her ears, for one, were unusual.</p>

  <p>These were long and slender, and unlike most ears, their top had an acute angular shape. Instead of human ears, hers resembled those of a cat's.</p>

  <p>Still, the girl appeared quite charming. Another distinction was her legs or the length of them. Hers were longer than most women's, but went perfectly with the rest of her body.</p>

  <p>"Who set the rules anyway that only a human being can look this way?</p>

  <p>Demon Night has always been like this. In their eyes, it is the human beings who have the similar appearance to theirs," the cyan dragon said slowly.</p>

  <p>"This girl is actually alive, isn't she?" Zheng wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>His mind was full of questions, but this was the first he voiced out.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon nodded and replied, "Each sword in the Killing Sword Mountain has an owner, and all the owners are alive. In case anyone dies, their swords will be buried deep in the mountain. Since the woman's sword is here, she is probably somewhere out in the world."</p>

  <p>At the cyan dragon's words, Zheng stared at the girl with a weird expression on his face.</p>

  <p>That meant his sword spirit had transformed into a girl of Demon Night for some unknown reason. How would it be if he met the real person in the future?</p>

  <p>Of course, the likelihood of that ever happening was very small.</p>

  <p>According to the cyan dragon, Demon Night did not exist in the same world inhabited by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I would like to name my sword spirit Lily," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>There was a slightly whimsical tone in his voice.</p>

  <p>Cultivating his sword spirit in such a short time was a big help in boosting Zheng's strength. At least the sword spirit could serve as a support, helping Zheng go further up on the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was a spiritual connection that Zheng had with his sword spirit, so he had complete control of her, including her thoughts.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng came up with a thought, she would do it as he expected.</p>

  <p>In a sense, the sword spirit was part of the disciple's being. If Zheng gave a sword to her, an enemy would be practically fighting against two people.</p>

  <p>And the sword spirit could do so much more than fight.</p>

  <p>Some skills of the double-sword system required the sword spirit to engage in combat. But Zheng usually did not choose to do this in most circumstances. He preferred to integrate the sword spirit with his Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>When the sword spirit integrated with the Streamer Sword, a red light would appear on the surface of the weapon and release a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>Breathing deeply, Zheng thought, 'The mountain is called Killing Sword Mountain. So it is intended to cultivate martial artists with killing skills!</p>

  <p>I didn't choose the way of cultivating my sword skills before. But I'm now walking the killing way without realizing it.' He stared intently at the Streamer Sword with a powerful killing aura in his hand.</p>

  <p>He kept thinking. 'Killing is not a bad thing. It is an important method to show and uphold justice. It is said to prevent violence through violence.</p>

  <p>That should be the real meaning of the killing way of practicing sword skills.'</p>

  <p>After a while, Zheng got ready to continue and left behind the sword of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Covered by the sword spirit, his Streamer Sword gained at least forty percent more power! Thousands of fairy weapons were stuck on the mountainside. Even when facing mature sword spirits, Zheng easily defeated them. He climbed even faster than before.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng came to the edge of the mountainside and didn't even feel slightly tired. A road appeared before him on the mountain ridge.</p>

  <p>Then he saw a blue sword blocking his way.</p>

  <p>Luxurious best described the sword. Black silk was used to cover its handle, adorned by a five-colored tassel. The entire metal blade looked so intricate, yet it was very striking.</p>

  <p>The sword's body, meanwhile, was shining and gave off blue light. There were even icy crystals on the blade's surface that waved gracefully. It truly looked magnificent.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng's first time to see a sacred weapon such as this. It was at the lower grade of a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>The disciple understood that it was not a real sacred weapon. The sword was merely a shadow while the actual sword was still in its owner's hand.</p>

  <p>As Zheng drew closer to the sword, the weapon suddenly quivered. Soon the sword was being pulled out of the ground, and a light blue figure stood in its place. The figure now held a sword and pointed it at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mumbling to himself, Zheng said, "The same thing is happening like that in the fairy weapon area. It is only a more mature sword spirit. The only difference is that the low-grade sacred weapon is much stronger than a fairy weapon." Staring intently at the blue shadow, he raised his Streamer Sword and pointed it at the image, ready to kill any time.</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could even move, a hint of hesitation made him suddenly stop. There was something quite strange here.</p>

  <p>This sword spirit seemed to be different from the others he previously encountered.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a mystical thing like other spirits but seemed to have a life of its own. And then the sword spirit opened its mouth and began to talk!</p>

  <p>"What? A young man at the second grade of the nature level can break into the mountain ridge?" The blue figure spoke with a tone of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Taken aback, Zheng raised his eyebrows in question while keeping the sword in his hand. This time, he spoke, "You're just a sword spirit. Why can you talk?</p>

  <p>You look like there's some part of your soul there!"</p>

  <p>This figure amazed Zheng. He had killed so many mature sword spirits, some of whom could shape themselves. But all of them only had dull appearances. While they were extremely competent in the practice of sword skills, Zheng still managed to defeat them because they couldn't think for themselves.</p>

  <p>But this blue figure standing before him could not only talk but even feel surprised. Apparently, it had a soul, however little, and a mind of its own.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it. How a person at grade two of the nature level can successfully pass the mountainside and end up here," the blue figure looked confused, and his brows furrowed with concern. Inhaling, he said,</p>

  <p>"But this is the end of your climb. You can stick your sword here. There is no place for your weapon if you go farther."</p>
