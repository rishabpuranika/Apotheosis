<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light ball slowly floated towards Luo Zheng and merged with his body once more.</p>

  <p>Clarence's voice rang from the depths of Luo Zheng's soul again. "The reality I gave you is not enough. You have to create your own reality as well."</p>

  <p>"Is there any difference?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Of course there is. This could be what I pursue, and also the reason you were born," answered Clarence.</p>

  <p>For humans, drinking the first mouthful of milk to fill their empty stomachs after birth was the beginning of their journey to life. From there, they grew step by step in pursuing strength, wealth, love, power, and the desire for immortality.</p>

  <p>However, Clarence was born in a perfect land and had everything he needed within his reach. There was nothing worth pursuing to him in neither the higher-grade worlds nor the lower-grade worlds, which drove him to seek the truth instead.</p>

  <p>Why did the world exist?</p>

  <p>What was behind the world and all the things in it?</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find the answers to these seemingly simple questions himself, let alone anyone else.</p>

  <p>Although Mastema was on par with him, Mastema had no interest in discussions such as these other than desperately downgrading the world.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, Clarence felt quite envious of Mastema. He only focused on the downgrading, giving it his full attention and refusing to think about anything else.</p>

  <p>While the world became downgraded little by little, Luo Zheng and the Evil God were born as special existences. How could Clarence let go of these two easily?</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Clarence's words, he couldn't help feeling hopeless. He wanted to bring his family to a stable environment and stay in the Immortal Mansion, but Clarence insisted on forcing him out.</p>

  <p>"Can I really create my own reality?" Luo Zheng asked hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I will help you," replied Clarence.</p>

  <p>"Fine." Luo Zheng heaved out a sigh as he began to pull himself together.</p>

  <p>The reality that Clarence mentioned became the greatest motivation for him. He looked forward to meeting his family again. He did not intend to give up even though he only had a glimmer of hope to cling to.</p>

  <p>Two dots suddenly appeared in the Wall World. Luo Zheng's eyeballs were slowly formed, followed by his whole head, body, and limbs.</p>

  <p>Because of the flat form, there was no need to follow the rules of humans in creation. A human body had no advantage in the Wall World, but was, in fact, a burden. Clarence had initially advised Luo Zheng to create himself in the form of a beetle or a worm.</p>

  <p>With many sets of feet, wings, and eyes, he would certainly gain a great advantage in the Wall World. He could observe better and even move faster.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng just couldn't accept it. In the end, he still created a human figure but with a rough shape.</p>

  <p>After his body had been completed, his eyes began to perceive the light.</p>

  <p>What he saw were thin lines in varying colors.</p>

  <p>"These thin lines are the only things I can see?" Luo Zheng asked as he felt a slight discontent.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You can only see the length and brightness of the thin lines; however, you can release your spiritual sense into these thin lines. In this way, you can infer their appearance," Clarence suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to do what Clarence had just said.</p>

  <p>The spiritual sense could only spread along the surface of the Wall World, but as it had been infused into the thin lines, Luo Zheng was able to see what was beyond them.</p>

  <p>However, everything in the Deep Space had been downgraded into a mess of various fragments. Even with his spiritual sense, it would still be difficult for him to make out the real shapes of these fragments.</p>

  <p>After he walked a short distance on the plane, he noticed a thin gray line.</p>

  <p>As usual, Luo Zheng released his spiritual sense, but the moment his spiritual sense was infused into the thin gray line, it vanished into thin air. It had actually been absorbed!</p>

  <p>"This thin gray line!"</p>

  <p>He was a little stunned but he immediately came to a conclusion. "This is the unbreakable gray soil. Has it also been downgraded?"</p>

  <p>"The gray soil has not and will not be downgraded. What you see is only a section line of it," said Clarence.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the lower-grade worlds would never be able to see the complete appearance of the creatures in the higher-grade worlds. If Luo Zheng had been born in the second-grade Wall World, he would always see only a thin gray line appearing to block the way. It would be impossible for him to even imagine what the gray soil was.</p>

  <p>"Which world does the gray soil belong to anyway?" Luo Zheng suddenly asked with his eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Clarence replied.</p>

  <p>The gray soil had already gathered at the edge of the perfect land, and no matter how much the world downgraded, it would only stay the same and wouldn't be affected.</p>

  <p>As the two of them discussed the second-grade world, two black lines suddenly appeared from the far ends, one from the left and the other from the right. They dashed very fast, closing in together and heading straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That's a strong aura of energy!" Luo Zheng exclaimed as he was shocked.</p>

  <p>Although he was not ready to fight in the Wall World, he instinctively retreated as he felt the danger approaching and instantly pushed his spiritual sense forward.</p>

  <p>Through his spiritual sense, Luo Zheng quickly recognized the shape of the black lines. They formed a huge pair of black scissors, and as their blades chomped, they intended to cut down Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was retreating at high speed, had escaped death. However, he saw black lines on his left, right, and back. He had already been trapped by the black scissors.</p>

  <p>"Evil God? Is that you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng used his spiritual sense to communicate in all directions.</p>

  <p>Since he wasn't dead, neither was the Evil God. It must be the Evil God who had launched such a powerful attack.</p>

  <p>The winner of the previous battle between the two of them could not be decided, so they had stopped fighting since then. Luo Zheng didn't have any idea why the Evil God was coming after him again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't get a response. The aura of the black lines was getting stronger and stronger. The scissors were also approaching at a higher speed.</p>

  <p>A thought flashed through Luo Zheng's mind, and a golden thread began to appear on the surface of his body. It was a golden ring that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>After the ring appeared, it quietly expanded outward, forming a much larger ring.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God spied in the dark, he would have seen the golden thread instantly smash the scissors.</p>

  <p>Although the black scissors were undeniably sharp, they immediately crashed as they touched the golden ring, dispersing their big and small fragments in the air.</p>

  <p>Red lines appeared as soon as the scissors were destroyed.</p>

  <p>These red lines then moved towards Luo Zheng in spiraling motions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng released another golden thread. Wherever the golden thread passed, all the red lines were devoured without a trace.</p>

  <p>"Evil God, your attacks are now useless.</p>

  <p>The energy in the second-grade Wall World is more fragmented and therefore easier to crack.</p>

  <p>Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng released his spiritual sense again to communicate widely. This time, he finally saw the Evil God's figure.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had four pairs of eyes on the Wall World, and he could observe up to four directions around him. His body took a circular shape, from which numerous spikes emerged. He resembled a bug with a strange shape.</p>

  <p>"So what? Since there's nothing to lose here, why don't we have a good fight?" the Evil God challenged him with his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"It's true that we really do have nothing to lose, but we can still obtain,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Obtain? Obtain what? The right to live in this shitty world?" the Evil God asked in an arrogant tone.</p>

  <p>He was also dissatisfied with the second-grade Wall World. Nothing could be more boring than a world where only lines could be seen!</p>
