<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2524 The Bloodline In The Wile Bones </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The two had never seen such a thing before, so they were confused, especially Zelda.</p>

  <p>After all, she knew very well how powerful she herself was.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, she had relied on the wild bones to grow at a steady pace, and her talent would today ensure that she could fully take advantage of the power in the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Only a very few Wild Gods that shared the same realm as her could actually surpass her.</p>

  <p>Despite her obvious strength and power, the young man before her blocked her blow. An attack that contained nearly all her might in one single fist!</p>

  <p>She was surprised by his reaction. Besides, he hadn't even become a Wild God yet. How terrifying would he be if he did become a Wild God?</p>

  <p>That was a scary thought.</p>

  <p>Zelda withdrew her fist at once.</p>

  <p>The faint yellow light on the surface of her body began flickering slightly before she began shrinking more and more.</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that she had returned to her original state.</p>

  <p>She picked up her clothes and slowly walked toward Luo Zheng. In her eyes, a trace of awe and doubt could be seen.</p>

  <p>'This guy just can't be a nobody! And yet, he's ignorant of both the Wild God and the world. What a strange man!' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"Where..." she mumbled a little. "Where did you come from?" Zelda curiously asked.</p>

  <p>"May I refuse to answer your question?" Luo Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>Zelda pursed her lips. She quickly came to the conclusion that Luo Zheng wouldn't tell her the truth easily, and thus, she asked him another question. "Tell me then, what's the purpose of your coming here?"</p>

  <p>"My purpose?" Luo Zheng asked pensively.</p>

  <p>His mother threw him down.</p>

  <p>Over time and especially now, Luo Zheng had gradually come to understand his history and what he would eventually have to face.</p>

  <p>If he had to have a purpose, then he indeed had one. "I want to become stronger!" he stated with confidence, his eyes shining eagerly.</p>

  <p>Luther suddenly interrupted them, "It seems that your enemy is very powerful, am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Why have you come to that conclusion?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're already so strong! And yet, you want to become stronger still. That's the only reason," said Luther with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't refute. After his mother had explained everything to him, he indeed realized that his opponents were truly formidable. Defeating Murphy and Nicholas was a near insurmountable problem. Moreover, they were not his only opponents throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>His only option was to become stronger. And what was more, doing so was quite urgent.</p>

  <p>"In that case, you can cultivate and try your best at becoming a Wild God. I can even teach you the techniques," Zelda said indifferently, changing back into her rough clothes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly as a look of disagreement came over him. It was true, a part of him did want to become a Wild God.</p>

  <p>When he looked down at the unimaginably enormous bones at the bottom of the chaos from above, Luo Zheng was deeply shocked.</p>

  <p>At the debate venue, Yan had summoned a huge shadow of Snake Goddess. Luo Zheng vaguely guessed at the possibility that all creatures here in the chaos as well as in the Source World could, and probably would, become giant.</p>

  <p>The techniques Zelda demonstrated only reinforced his belief that he had guessed correctly.</p>

  <p>If the world at the bottom of the chaos was really focused on becoming a Wild God, then Luo Zheng was confident he'd find the cultivation method there.</p>

  <p>That said, he wasn't necessarily familiar with this place, and the world was far more complicated than he'd ever imagined or faced before.</p>

  <p>Zelda was from a small tribe, but she had such powerful strength. If Luo Zheng accidentally exposed something or provoked someone in this place, there was a real danger and risk that he'd die.</p>

  <p>In the universe, he was generally protected by his father, and in the divine land, he had Harold as well as his mother. However, here, things were different. Here, he had nothing and no one.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Zheng said, as he looked into her eyes with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But there's still one important condition," Zelda mentioned, as a sly smile spread over her face.</p>

  <p>"And what might that be?" Luo Zheng asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"You have to teach Luther the life vitality cultivation technique," Zelda stated in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>"Zelda..." Luther was stunned by what he heard. His jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>He'd had his fair share of bad luck from an early age, and all his meridians were sealed. For this reason, he was unable to cultivate and become a Wild God.</p>

  <p>As a result, his talent could only be used on various, rather simple tricks.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time Luther had entered the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>He'd harvest every time he went inside it but because it was too dangerous, Zelda wouldn't allow him.</p>

  <p>"Okay, fine. But I'll only teach him the cultivation technique and I won't accept any disciples," Luo Zheng agreed lightly.</p>

  <p>As an exchange of services, Luo Zheng thought it was quite fair.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, body refining had never been very popular in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, the three thousand Divine Dao were theurgies left behind for the Sacred race by Chiyou. Other than the Might Godly Way, other Divine Dao just didn't fit with body refiners.</p>

  <p>The mainstream cultivation techniques for body refining were the Eight Path Platforms and the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>However, the cultivation technique for becoming a Wild God created a whole other means. It was a completely new system.</p>

  <p>"The Wild God Power contained in the wild bones is actually a kind of inheritance," Zelda explained.</p>

  <p>"A kind of inheritance? What do you mean by that?" A puzzled expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he asked his question.</p>

  <p>"Yes, an inheritance!" Zelda went on to explain, "These wild bones are left behind by the ancient strong. Despite enduring eons of development, the power within the bones has never disappeared. To the contrary, in fact, it has firmly condensed itself into the bones, hence eventually transforming into these wild bones. In other words, all of our power is passed down from our ancient masters!" Zelda raised her tone of voice a notch in excitement.</p>

  <p>Only after hearing her explanation did Luo Zheng have a better understanding of it all.</p>

  <p>There were countless bones gathered at the bottom of the chaos, many of which belonged to powerful masters. This was the reason why people here were capable of displaying such a unique cultivation technique.</p>

  <p>"The wild bone you hold in your hand contains the Wild God Power, and you can absorb it," Zelda said. "Absorb it until the Wild God Power has completely infiltrated you as well as every part of your body!"</p>

  <p>To infiltrate every part of his body...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought back to the time when he had just started practicing martial arts.</p>

  <p>His ultimate goal then was to thoroughly remove all the impurities from his flesh body.</p>

  <p>However, the method for using the wild bone was the exact opposite. He needed to completely infiltrate his body with the wild bone's power.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry too much. It's the lowest grade wild bone, so you won't be resistant to it. Some powerful wild bones aren't so easy to absorb," Zelda added.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying there are even stronger wild bones?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Taking on an indifferent expression, Zelda smiled and said, "Of course, there are many kinds of wild bones throughout the Immemorial Wilderness. Some of their owners were extremely powerful in their day!</p>

  <p>Even trillions of years after their death, the marks of power contained in their bones haven't disappeared. And chances are, they never will. The power hidden in this kind of wild bones is extremely strong, but that kind of power is only be passed down to the descendants. That is to say, those who absorb their power must have their blood."</p>

  <p>"Must have their blood, you mean?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded, only once. "Several years ago, I dug out two pieces of wild bones that contained Chiyou's bloodline. But I couldn't absorb the power found within them. I could only sell or trade them for ordinary wild bones..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Zelda couldn't stop her expression from displaying a hint of disappointment. The power and impact were different from each other in the wild bones, but something like blood was predestined.</p>

  <p>That said, Zelda exchanged the two wild bones for dozens of ordinary ones. These bones had laid her foundation and eventually helped her in becoming a Wild God. Now though, as she thought back, she still felt the loss simply wasn't worth the gain.</p>
