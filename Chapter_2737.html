  <p>
</p>

  <p>After thinking about it for a while, Luo Zheng decided to ask the Magical Crow.</p>

  <p>Since the Magical Crow had stayed in the Reincarnation Land for a long time, it probably knew other ways to leave this place.</p>

  <p>This time when Luo Zheng pushed open the door, he wasn't met with any obstacles. Instead, the door opened just a crack with a gentle push.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he entered, he heard a ear-piercing rumbling sound.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the Five Elements Divine Dao had circulated and transformed into a five elements array with Leland inside it.</p>

  <p>To get a Latent token, Leland had to pass the test of the hall soul.</p>

  <p id="top_26">Luo Zheng stood still and observed him for a while, and then he took a detour on the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Luo Zheng had obtained the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, the hall soul didn't stop him.</p>

  <p>After entering through the small door behind the hall, Luo Zheng found himself face to face with the Magical Crow again.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come back?" the Magical Crow asked in a strange voice.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other way to leave the Reincarnation Land?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Zheng had come to the Reincarnation Land was to find out the truth about the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>Now, through Tianming's memories, he knew that the alliance of the powerful clans had reached the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he wanted to avoid them.</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow, however, didn't know why Luo Zheng had asked this question. "The Reincarnation Land is connected to the Abyss Demon Region. The way out of here is naturally through the Abyss Demon Region. What other way do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"We came here from a cave in the Evil Ghost Region. Can we leave through that cave?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>After some thought, the Magical Crow shook its head. "You came here through a one-way transmission array created by three Reincarnation Spirits. That road is irreversible..."</p>

  <p>"In other words, I can only leave through the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Then, the Magical Crow added, "Anyway, with your strength, it won't be difficult for you to leave the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>'It won't be difficult?' Luo Zheng repeated to himself in his mind, smiling helplessly at the crow's words.</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow must have been trapped here for too long.</p>

  <p>The forbidden area in the Abyss Demon Region had expanded numerous times in the past countless years, and the vicious beasts within it had also become stronger and stronger under the baptism of the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had seen the savage scene in Tianming's memories.</p>

  <p>Just a few fiends could wreak utter chaos. If it hadn't been for Nicholas, the entire group might have been annihilated completely.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there were many fiends in the abyss that were even stronger than Edmond.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked his eyes decisively at the Magical Crow. "Since it won't be difficult, can you send me out?"</p>

  <p>"Caw! Caw!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the crow suddenly withdrew its wings and crouched down on the golden branch, perched motionlessly as if it had become a sculpture.</p>

  <p>No matter what Luo Zheng said, the Magical Crow did not answer.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng shook his head in surrender and turned around to leave. It seemed that he could only discuss this with Leland.</p>

  <p>But just then, the Magical Crow suddenly spoke again, "The man outside can take one of the Latent Theurgies. The rest are yours!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng turned his head and shot a smile at the Magical Crow.</p>

  <p>Then, he walked out through the small door.</p>

  <p>Even if the Magical Crow hadn't mentioned it, Luo Zheng would have taken a Latent token anyway.</p>

  <p>If a warrior wanted to break into the Abyss Demon Region, the more treasures they had, the better. Moreover, the Latent Theurgies had been left by Chiyou, so they would definitely be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>In the Reincarnation Hall, Leland was tired and gasping for breath.</p>

  <p>The several rounds of test he had been put through were something that even he, a Demi-holy Being, found difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>He had exhausted almost all of his strength trying to pass them.</p>

  <p>"Can I choose a Latent token?" asked Leland.</p>

  <p>He sensed a mysterious power from the spheres. Each sphere seemed to hold a different power, so he wanted to choose the one he felt the most connection with.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the hall soul replied mechanically, "You are not qualified to choose one. I will make a Latent token for you."</p>

  <p>Then, the hall soul's arm lengthened until it reached the top of a statue and pointed at a sphere.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The sphere the hall soul was pointing at shook and flew around in the air before finally stopping above Leland's head.</p>

  <p>Leland sized up the sphere and asked, "What's the power of this Latent token?"</p>

  <p>"You can find that out with your own spiritual sense," the hall soul replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Leland released his spiritual sense and sent it into the sphere.</p>

  <p>Leland seemed to detect something, and then a dejected expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been observing the whole scene, curiously walked over to Leland and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Leland smiled bitterly. "This Latent token is revenge!"</p>

  <p>"Revenge?" Luo Zheng was slightly stunned. He had never heard of revenge being a power before.</p>

  <p>"Only if I die and my cultivation vanishes will this Latent token come into effect and release Fission Thunder Spirit to help me take revenge,"</p>

  <p>Leland explained.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng and Leland didn't know what Fission Thunder Spirit was, the power of the Latent token couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The problem, however, was that this token wouldn't work until Leland died. Even though it would help him to take revenge, it wouldn't mean much, especially to Leland.</p>

  <p>"That's how all the Latent Theurgies are. They're very powerful, but they'll only work when certain requirements are met," the hall soul added nonchalantly, not caring about Leland's feelings.</p>

  <p>"Got it," Leland said gloomily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and turned to the hall soul. "That crow said that all the other Latent Theurgies are mine now."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Leland stared blankly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had broken his back just to get one Latent token, and it had turned out to be an almost useless one as it would only work when he died. Now Luo Zheng was taking away all the other Latent Theurgies?</p>

  <p>How was that even possible? As far as he knew, Luo Zheng hadn't been put through even a single test.</p>

  <p>However, what happened next made him realize that Luo Zheng was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>The hall soul floated in the air silently for a while, and then nodded. "I know."</p>

  <p>Then its arm lengthened again and pointed at the spheres above the remaining seven statues.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!</p>

  <p>Seven pale yellow spheres floated slowly toward Luo Zheng and hovered over his head.</p>

  <p>Each of the nine statues in the Reincarnation Hall had a Latent token.</p>

  <p>Gregorio had taken one and Leland had taken another, so there were only seven Latent Theurgies left.</p>

  <p>Curious about these Latent Theurgies, Luo Zheng raised his head and injected his spiritual sense into one of the spheres.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng had already comprehended the function of this Latent token.</p>

  <p>'Killing Intent Counterattack! When someone shows their killing intention to me, this token will summon the Soul Suppressing Sword to launch a counterattack.'</p>

  <p>Through his spiritual sense, Luo Zheng faintly sensed a soul sword sealed within this sphere.</p>

  <p>Though the Soul Suppressing Sword was sealed in the sphere, Luo Zheng could feel its terrifying power.</p>

  <p> </p>
