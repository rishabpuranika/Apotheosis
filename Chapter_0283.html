<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>He had triggered the explosion of his life vitality directly. Bob never imagined that the energy of the explosion would be so horrible, it even eliminated all his chilly water drops!</p>

  <p>It was why Bob panicked. He wondered why Zheng's life vitality was so powerful. The energy of the little stars in Zheng's life vitality was so great that Bob's heart trembled.</p>

  <p>However, as a master at consummation of the nature level, Bob's mind had already tampered in various kinds of situations in the process of cultivating from a beginner to such a high level.</p>

  <p>He realized that besides keeping himself calm, he should counterattack his opponents immediately.</p>

  <p>After sensing Zheng's location, Bob waved his sword to him. He waved so hard that the sword, which was as thin as a cicada's wings, was almost bent to its breaking point. Then, tens of thousands of chilly water drops suddenly shot out.</p>

  <p>'Anyhow, these water droplets should be able to hold off Zheng's attack, '</p>

  <p>Bob thought to himself.</p>

  <p>However, he had gravely underestimated Zheng's speed.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng had not dodged those water droplets, not because he could not deflect any of them, but that he just did not try.</p>

  <p>Since the situation was quite different at this instant, he tried his best to suppress Bob.</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Crystal in his right arm suddenly gleamed. The energy coursed through his veins and then spread all over his body.</p>

  <p>"Whew!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng turned into a blur. Like a gust of wind, he dispersed those chilly water drops from the sky covered by them.</p>

  <p>Just then, the vision of Roger, Cao and Bob returned. When they saw Zheng had turned into a blur, they were so surprised that they almost thought it was an illusion.</p>

  <p>"How fast!" Roger could not help but cry out.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Bob realized he could not perceive Zheng either.</p>

  <p>'Where's he?' he wondered, looking around. He placed his sword in front of his chest horizontally and maintained maximum alert as he waited for Zheng to strike.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Bob felt a small hint of wind coming from above his head, and then he waved his sword upward instinctively.</p>

  <p>Reaching out from above the head of Bob, Zheng aimed at Bob's sword blade.</p>

  <p>'You want to grab my sword with bare hands?' thought Bob in surprise.</p>

  <p>Immediately, he laughed and shouted, "You're dicing with death!"</p>

  <p>The sword in Bob's hand was a middle-grade spiritual weapon. As it was made of the 'Polaris steel', it was extremely thin.</p>

  <p>This particular sword had been sent to the weapon-refining workshop of his family before. After being burnt to red by the weapon refiner, the sword blade had become nearly transparent.</p>

  <p>So one could imagine how thin it was! Being so thin, if the sword had been made of ordinary material, it would have broken soon after the slightest touch. Only when it was made with the Polaris steel, which was tough enough, could the sword be refined so thin.</p>

  <p>Being so narrowly thin, it was much sharper than ordinary swords.</p>

  <p>'How dare the young man grab my sword with his bare hands! Let me cut his hands off!'</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Bob shook his arm hard and the sword vibrated quickly before cutting towards Zheng's wrist.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Zheng pushed his right hand forward lightly and pinched the tip of Bob's sword in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>'So fast!' Bob shouted in his heart.</p>

  <p>He wondered why Zheng could control his speed to such a degree.</p>

  <p>Sometimes fast, other times slow. The man's moves were so unpredictable! Although Zheng pinched his sword blade, Bob did not worry about it. He suddenly withdrew his sword and tried to stab Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Shocked, Bob's face turned pale when he tried to withdraw his sword. In spite of the advantages he had, he still failed to grab his sword back.</p>

  <p>First, as he was holding the sword handle, whereas Zheng was only pinching the sword blade with two fingers, it would have been much easier for him to apply force on the sword.</p>

  <p>Second, Bob had reached the consummation of the nature level while Zheng had just reached the first-grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>In every way one looked, Bob should have had an absolute advantage in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>When Bob tried for the second time however, he failed again. The sword appeared as though it was embedded between Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>With an utmost disbelief expression on his face, Bob looked like he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that he had met many people who were born with great strength.</p>

  <p>He knew a man who seemed to possess endless strength. When this man had just reached the marrow refining level, he was able to compete with the masters at half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>However, even though they were born with great strength, they had their limit.</p>

  <p>How could the strength of a corporeal body like Zheng's have reached such an extent!</p>

  <p>There was a world of difference between the top-grade nature level practitioners and the first-grade nature level practitioners. Now, because of Zheng, Bob had changed his view.</p>

  <p>No one saw it coming. Not even he could have imagined that he would somehow admit that Zheng was much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>After recovering from a brief shock, Bob immediately activated the life vitality in his body.</p>

  <p>By any means, he was not someone who would throw in the towel so easily. Losing to a young man at first-grade of the nature level was very unacceptable for him.</p>

  <p>The life vitality came out from his arm and emanated upward along his sword before solidifying into white snowflakes on the sword's blade.</p>

  <p>Then, the snowflakes formed a long and thin line and quickly mounted on the tip of the sword blade.</p>
