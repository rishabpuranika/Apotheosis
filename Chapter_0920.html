<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 920 Cultivate Warrior Spirit (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The confusion increased. What was Yolande's part in entering the Gate of Samsara? Xun's words were baffling and didn't seem to make sense.</p>

  <p>But Yolande nodded cautiously and said, "You're right. I don't mind letting you in."</p>

  <p>"You don't?" Esther stared at Yolande in bewilderment. "You're the owner of the gate?"</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't reply, and Xun didn't seem to have any intention of explaining to them.</p>

  <p>However, according to Xun, this gate was magical and could not be taken away, which was why, despite their doubts, they would not let go of this opportunity to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Spirit could only be tempered by warriors' experiences, and it was related to warriors' growing environment and how they saw the world.</p>

  <p>For example, a talent who grew up without obstacles was spoken highly of and seldom encountered problems in his training. But his spirit was very fragile, and he was vulnerable to heavy blows. Once he became frustrated, it was very likely that he would never rise again and be a warrior.</p>

  <p>But if he could withstand the blows, he would become more mature, tenacious, and confident.</p>

  <p>The spirit could be sharpened by repeated attacks, which was inevitable for the growth of warriors.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to sharpen the spirit was a matter of chance rather than choice. Even a minor mistake would bring about great negative effects. So it was strange to hear that they could cultivate their spirit.</p>

  <p>"I'll go inside first," Fabian said, taking the lead and walking up to the gate.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to collect the gate, but there was no prohibition on doing so.</p>

  <p>Fabian pushed at it lightly and it swung open.</p>

  <p>There was a small whirlpool in the middle of the gate, moving slowly anticlockwise.</p>

  <p>"Is it dangerous?" The scene worried Fabian, but he knew that caution was important for safety. Yolande and Xun seemed to know the origin of the gate, but no one knew what danger was waiting for them.</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head. "Not at all. You can go in."</p>

  <p>Fabian nodded and continued to walk ahead. As soon as he stepped into the whirlpool, a golden light flashed, in which everyone felt the passage of time.</p>

  <p>"It's the Time Law," said Luo Zheng, staring at the light.</p>

  <p>It was not some low level Time Law that could be ignored, but a high layer one. No one could explain its mystery.</p>

  <p>After all, the warriors on the Sea God Continent could only comprehend the first or the second layer of the Time Law. In the Central Region, no one could comprehend the Time Law. Compared with the Space Law, the Time Law was rarer and more mysterious.</p>

  <p>The light on the Gate of Samsara flickered slowly. They thought they would have to wait for a long time, maybe a day or even a few days. After all, cultivation speed was known to be slow. Some cultivation methods needed many years. Only after decades or hundreds of years could warriors reach the peak.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they were not pressed for time in the Dark Nether Cave. The Dark Nether Death Light wouldn't be weakened until about a month later.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't expect to see Fabian come out of the gate after just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"How did he come out so quickly?"</p>

  <p>"What could he have cultivated in such a short time?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it has something to do with the Time Law. It's a mysterious law, so it may be able to shorten the time to the extreme. Maybe a long time has passed behind the gate."</p>

  <p>"Fabian, say something! Don't keep us guessing!"</p>

  <p>Only then did they notice that Fabian was standing in front of the gate, staring straight ahead, stunned.</p>

  <p>"What is he doing over there? Is he scared silly?" Jarrod walked quickly to Fabian and waved his hand in front of him. Fabian swatted Jarrod's hand away and said, "Don't touch me. I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"Thinking? Right here?" Jarrod was confused. "What the hell is behind the Gate of Samsara? Looks like it makes people foolish!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool!" Fabian said hotly but eventually rolled his eyes and pulled Jarrod aside. "You can go in too. I have learned a lot inside!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell!" Jarrod muttered. Fabian looked normal after coming out of the gate, but Jarrod had found some subtle changes on him. His eyes, for example, had become more intense.</p>

  <p>Jarrod and Fabian were like brothers, so Jarrod knew that Fabian wouldn't harm him. With this confidence and without hesitation, he stepped into the gate.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, Jarrod came out of the gate. Like Fabian, his eyes had dulled. He murmured, "What a surprise."</p>

  <p>Neither Yolande nor Xun spoke. They seemed to know what had happened.</p>

  <p>Esther and the other two top-level war lords of the Demon Night were puzzled. This behavior from Fabian and Jarrod was only piquing their curiosity about the Gate of Samsara.</p>

  <p>Esther took a step forward and entered the gate.</p>

  <p>When she came out, her eyes were calm as water but like black pearls that glowed faintly. Then, without a word, she walked up to stand beside Xun, silent.</p>

  <p>Next, the two top-level war lords of the Demon Night entered the Gate of Samsara one after the other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the last one to enter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also asked Xun what the gate was about. She had smiled faintly but hadn't answered his question. She just told him that he would understand everything after he went inside.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before it was Zheng's turn.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the gate and looked around before stepping into it.</p>

  <p>The raging Time Law wrapped him up. He now felt that time here seemed to stop. All the voices disappeared and he was left alone in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also very interested in learning about how to cultivate his spirit. As the name of the gate suggested, it must have something to do with the circle of life.</p>

  <p>Compared with learning about luck, it was even more difficult to know whether people would be reincarnated after they died. It was simply impossible to determine whether they would have a next life.</p>

  <p>It was said that after death, people would be put through the six great divisions in the wheel of karma and go to Avici Hell. But the question was, where were the six great divisions in the wheel of karma? And where was this hell?</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Zheng practiced the Stellar Body, he had traveled through the universe with his consciousness, saw the true face of the world, and greatly broadened his vision. However, he also understood that what he had seen was only the tip of the iceberg. The universe had endless mysteries and it would take him many years to explore every one of them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the process of exploration was the significance of life.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought through this, he spotted a huge golden spiral in front of him. He was then sucked into it and his surroundings changed gradually.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" Luo Zheng muttered, unable to believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>He found himself in gold armor, standing on the wall of the Burning Sky Imperial Capital, holding a golden machete and looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>"My hands and feet are out of control." He subconsciously wanted to move but failed.</p>

  <p>He then involuntarily waved his machete and roared at the front, "My dear generals and soldiers, the Burning Sky Imperial Capital has been destroyed.</p>

  <p>After I ascend the throne, I'll rule the city with you all!</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>Beneath the wall, many soldiers in gold armor charged towards the Burning Sky Imperial Capital.</p>

  <p>Fire beacons could be seen everywhere within the Imperial Capital and blood was flowing on the ground like water.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked around, puzzled, dozens of emerald green lights suddenly rose in the sky before him. The first person to come into view was Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists who were at the Internal Elixir Realm stood beside Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo, you traitor! The Burning Sky Palace will kill you no matter what price we may have to pay!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, along with the martial artists at the Internal Elixir Realm, surrounded Luo Zheng like a stream of inescapable light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng laughed wildly. He waved his golden machete and ran ahead to meet the attack. The two sides began to fight fiercely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in the body that charged, but he couldn't control what he said or what he did.</p>

  <p>He only knew that he had become a traitor to the Burning Sky Empire and was about to usurp the state power. If he defeated the people in front of him, he would be able to rule the empire and become a new emperor in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>"Is this what happened in the past? Or is it a dream?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng calmly watched the fierce battle in front of him. Like an outsider, he watched the drama unfold.</p>
