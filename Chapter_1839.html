<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Taking a great deal of responsibility, Kennan had brought the Princess Royal into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Due to the special nature of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, even those from the divine land would cultivate there.</p>

  <p>All of the famous sects in the divine land had branches built within it.</p>

  <p>Even some large cities were built by people from the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan was no exception.</p>

  <p>A city, which was located three hundred million miles away from the Collapsing Mountain race, occupied a teleporting area. It could be considered as one of the biggest cities in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Emperor was still worried. That was why he had sent Kennan and the others to ensure the safety of the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>The previous encounter with the Formless Sky Python scared the hell out of Kennan.</p>

  <p>In order to save Han Liusu, they had risked everything.</p>

  <p>Thinking about the price to pay for using the Wishing Spell, he felt quite terrified.</p>

  <p>Making a promise meant carrying it out in this life. Failure to do so would not only result in a big loophole in their warrior spirit, but a destruction on their cultivation at a critical moment.</p>

  <p>Given this high stake, they usually wouldn't use the Wishing Spell unless they felt irreconcilable hatred for their enemies.</p>

  <p>But due to unavoidable circumstances, Kennan had to make a promise to the Formless Sky Python. Now he had to keep that promise, or suffer the consequences if he failed. He really didn't have much choice. He was well aware of the risks in the task they were given. If the Princess Royal really died, they would also have their heads chopped off when they returned. Getting reminded of the fear he felt with the Formless Sky Python, Kennan shook his head again. Some day in the future, he would have a chance to fulfill his promise. Until that day, he should try not to worry about it too much.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Princess Royal was unharmed.</p>

  <p>But now, as they continued, Kennan had again seen some signs of trouble, and even some signs of danger.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal seemed to have a favorable impression of the secondary creature!</p>

  <p>"Danyaal, what do you think?" Kennan asked, waiting for a piece of advice.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Danyaal replied back in a puzzled tone, unable to interpret what Kennan was referring to.</p>

  <p>"You? Forget it."</p>

  <p>Kennan exclaimed with a sigh. He knew that his companions were planning on doing nothing about it.</p>

  <p>They knew very well that the Princess Royal was extremely important to the Holy Emperor, but the problem was the Princess Royal had been engaged.</p>

  <p>Thinking about it, Kennan decided to persuade the Princess Royal, but before he could, Danyaal stopped him. "Kennan, don't worry. What you think won't happen."</p>

  <p>"But?" Kennan hesitated.</p>

  <p>"There are some matters that the Princess Royal is unable to decide. That man is just a secondary creature, so I'm sure there is nothing to worry about. There will be people who will deal with him when we get back.</p>

  <p>You and I, as servants, can just pretend that we know nothing," Danyaal said flatly.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, people like Kennan and Danyaal were as unremarkable as small shrimps. There were things that they couldn't manage. They spent all day sitting back and protecting the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's most basic training continued.</p>

  <p>As foreseen, Luo Zheng's strength increased every day. At the beginning, it was difficult for him to walk in the Collapsing Mountain race, but as time passed by, he felt that the gravitational force was getting weaker, which meant that he was getting stronger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a living proof that as long as ordinary martial artists picked themselves up in the Collapsing Mountain race, they would make rapid progress.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng had received the best treatment. In order to help him grow quickly, the Collapsing Mountain race had given him much better treatment than all other martial artists.</p>

  <p>Every day at dawn, he would be baptized by all the war songs. At sunset, he would feast on all kinds of powerful fierce beasts. For Luo Luo Zheng, this was the most primitive and most effective method of training.</p>

  <p>In a span of three months, Luo Luo Zheng had improved a lot that he was finally able to resist the gravitational force and walk freely. If he gritted his teeth and tried harder, he could walk as if on wings. However, it was a pity that the gravitational force in the race was too strong. Although Luo Luo Zheng knew that his strength had increased a lot, there was no way to confirm how strong he really was.</p>

  <p>Other than Luo Luo Zheng, the rest of the Godly Geniuses in the universe were also cultivating diligently in different places of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>In a city 30 million miles away from the Collapsing Mountain race, Nathan had defeated his last opponent. Now he had one more red trial tally in his hand.</p>

  <p>In just a few months, he had already obtained thirty-six red trial tallies.</p>

  <p>The city was surrounded by three trial grounds, but unless warriors had red trial tallies to use as payment, they would lose the chance to enter.</p>

  <p>However, to Nathan, trial grounds at such a level were useless.</p>

  <p>"I still lack 64 red trial tallies. My progress should be the fastest, right? I wonder how Luo Luo Zheng is doing now."</p>

  <p>Nathan aimed to accumulate a hundred red trial tallies. That way he could exchange them for a purple trial tally. When that time came, he would be able to enter the Wind Exterminating Valley to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Known as one of the six sacred places for trial, he wanted to get into the Wind Exterminating Valley, which was the final destination of his trip to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>After putting away the red trial tallies he collected, Nathan once again stepped onto the battle ring, looking around to find his opponents beneath.</p>

  <p>"Who else wants to challenge me?" he shouted proudly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in an emerald forest 200 million miles away, The scenery was beautiful and enchanting. The trees and the weeds all looked like carved emeralds as the beams of the light reflected on them. The sound of birds chirping filled the air.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was not in the mood to appreciate such scenery.</p>

  <p>He traveled in the forest as fast as the speed of light, not letting anyone catch him with their bare eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Following a flash of a sword gleam, a cyan and grey colored spirit musk deer fell to the ground, badly hurt.</p>

  <p>Fluttering, Tianming had drawn the musk deer into his space ring.</p>

  <p>The musk deer was a very agile beast. Both its skin and body were valuable, worth at least fifteen green trial tallies, but its eyes were the most precious. It was said that their eyes would turn into a beautiful deep green color when it fled in panic-a strange reaction coming from fear.</p>

  <p>The greener the eyes of the musk deer were, the more valuable they became.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after Tianming discovered a spirit musk deer, he would not kill it initially. Instead, he would allow it to flee, letting it run for its life in a long time before chasing and killing it with a single slash.</p>

  <p>He knew that this was a cruel method, but he had come to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for the sake of upgrading himself. In order to obtain a purple trial tally and gain the qualifications to enter the Mind Refining Tower, he had no choice but to do so.</p>

  <p>"I need a bit more trial tallies, but I collect them faster than I expected."</p>

  <p>Sitting under an emerald tree, he decided to stop for a while and rest.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The loud roaring sound broke the silence all of a sudden, causing Tianming to tremble in fear as he quickly hid himself. The spirit musk deer was not the only inhabitant in this forest. There were many other powerful beasts that Tianming could not fight against.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, in another city, Mu Ning was strolling on the street, feeling extremely bored.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was not a good place to travel alone. The key thing was that Luo Luo Zheng was not with her, and she had no confidence to find him.</p>

  <p>According to the news, the suburbs of the city would become extremely dangerous at night. As the sun had already set, darkness started to fall.</p>

  <p>"Where could Luo Luo Zheng be?" Mu Ning murmured.</p>

  <p>"Hey, little girl!"</p>

  <p>The low voice of a man coming from the side startled her.</p>

  <p>Turning her head, Mu Ning saw a masked warrior dressed in black. She found him dressed a little strange, but from his appearance, he appeared like a human. Mu Ning blinked. She had seen a lot of strange-looking creatures recently.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I come here because I feel a unique Mu Ning from your body," the masked martial artist answered, letting out a dry laugh.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning glared at him, her face revealing a hint of vigilance. Other than the Illusion Battlefield, she had never cultivated alone, so she was clueless on dealing with such a situation. However, she was not stupid.</p>

  <p>She decided not to provoke anyone with unknown origins. Turning to look at another direction, she decided to just let it be.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to leave, the masked martial artist had flashed to her front, blocking her path.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Mu Ning reproached coldly. She bet this man would not dare to make a move in this city. Partly, that made her feel hopeful.</p>

  <p>"You're quite vigilant. Do you know what this is?" Four sword images slowly appeared on the masked warrior's back. Then, the four swords suddenly moved and formed an unique array.</p>

  <p>Seeing the way the four swords were arranged, Mu Ning was taken aback. Although this was merely the first movement of the sword array, her familiarity was aroused.</p>

  <p>"It's God Slaughtering Array. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>All the Godly Geniuses, including Xenia, Kurt and Lucille, were cultivating in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, striving to make a breakthrough the soonest time possible.</p>

  <p>All of them had their own fortuitous encounters and dangers.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had completely adapted to the gravitational force of the Collapsing Mountain race, as if it didn't exist at all.</p>

  <p>"When my brother entered the Collapsing Mountain race, he took a year and a half to be able to move freely."</p>

  <p>Impressed, Han Liusu thought it was incredible. Kennan and the rest were equally surprised. They found it hard to believe that a secondary creature like Luo Luo Zheng could completely adapt to the gravitational force in just half a year without relying on any external force.</p>
