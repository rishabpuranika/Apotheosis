<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2120 Zheng's Guidance (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng certainly knew that if he made up any kind of story, there would always be something he couldn't explain clearly. Little details and crucial parts would usually be a dead giveaway in a false story.</p>

  <p>However, if he provided less information instead, it was less likely that they would discover that he was a liar. Additionally, it didn't matter whether they believed all of his words or not.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these people were just some divine citizens. It was impossible for them to find out anything about his background. For those citizens, they would easily dismiss Zheng as a random passerby.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had expected, Woolley did not pursue the topic any longer.</p>

  <p>Instead, he told Zheng honestly that their little mountain village was quite remote in the Vast Sky Region. Even the nearest divine city was very far away. As such, a smile shone in Woolley's face as he invited Zheng to stay in the Misty Mountain Village first.</p>

  <p>The Misty Mountain Village faced a great enemy and Zheng was a proving godly warrior. Ever since he arrived at their village, their invitation was completely within Zheng's expectations. He gladly accepted the offer.</p>

  <p>After he witnessed that Zheng had agreed to stay, Woolley immediately beamed with pleasure. "My friend, I bet you must be wearied by your long journey. It must have been a long way before you arrived here.</p>

  <p>Brother, go and fetch two jugs of our best wines for our honored guest!"</p>

  <p>Afterward, Woolley opened the large pot in front of him. A rich aroma of meat suddenly filled the entire place.</p>

  <p id="top_14">Zheng hadn't eaten any food for a long time. As such, he immediately felt his appetite stir the moment he smelled the aroma of the meat. A loud growl was heard in his abdomen. Based on Woolley's introduction, the meat stewed in the pot had been peeled off from the Iron Tooth Beast.</p>

  <p>As a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, Woolley didn't need to eat food as well. However, he still ate the meat of the Iron Tooth Beast which had the function to increase his strength. For the True Gods, the beast was considered nothing. Nonetheless, it was a precious ingredient for the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Zheng politely ate a few cuts of meat and immediately felt a warm sensation in his stomach. The energy from the meat was even purer than that of the top-level beasts in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land! At once, the power from the meat surged throughout Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was not surprised by what happened. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was the inner world of Holy Jay. As such, the living creatures there were formed by the vitality between heaven and earth that Holy Jay had absorbed. They were still secondary creatures. Although the Iron Tooth Beast had a low level, it was still an ordinary creature. It was formed by chaotic energy, so it was essentially different from all secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>The meat stew was a very delicious meal. After they had their fill, the villagers of Misty Mountain Village arranged a comfortable loft for Zheng to stay in.</p>

  <p>Zheng naturally didn't need to sleep. However, he was still in a predicament because his elixir field was still sealed.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Zheng had tried his best to control the golden blood in his body to wash away the black lines on his elixir field. But these black lines were unusually stubborn, and he had managed to break only several of them. A lot of them still remained and clogged his elixir field. He was extremely anxious about the situation.</p>

  <p>The restoration of his strength as soon as possible was Zheng's greatest goal at the current stage. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to travel around the divine land. He would be easy prey for the beasts that wandered it. Worse, he could be targeted by strong warriors.</p>

  <p>Additionally, based on the information he gathered, the village had enemies. The village was still peaceful and safe when Zheng arrived.</p>

  <p>However, the danger of an enemy attack still lingered. Woolley even informed him that there were quite a few warriors in the Sun Moon Village. Also, among them were some formidable proving godly warriors, namely warriors of a world lord's level.</p>

  <p>Zheng had fought world lords from the divine land in the past. A few years ago in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, there were many divine land geniuses that had been defeated by him. Most of them were from the great clans in the divine land. However, they were still no match against Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, with his elixir field sealed, the methods that Zheng could use were very limited. His strength had been greatly reduced, thus, made him very weak. A rather weaker and easily defeated enemy would be enough to give Zheng a hard time.</p>

  <p>Darkness surrounded the village. Night came by with a cold breeze. As time went by, the sun had also begun to rise.</p>

  <p>Zheng was relentless as he willed his golden blood to wash over his elixir field. However, he only broke four more black lines. There were more than a hundred of them intertwined around his elixir field. It seemed that it would take him at least a month to break all of them. Desperation crept in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>He stopped his meditation and sighed helplessly. All he could do was shrug with disappointment.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he heard a series of high-pitched sounds from outside.</p>

  <p>Curiosity had enveloped Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hold your sword tight and widen your eyes. Gather your strength, and stride squarely!"</p>

  <p>The sun had not yet fully risen. However, multiple swords were heard as they clashed with each other from outside the house. Even though it was just the break of dawn, dozens of warriors already held swords and sparred with each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood up and pushed open the door. As he laid eyes on the field, he saw Woolley with a cyan steel sword. Systematic strikes and slashes were magnificently displayed by Woolley.</p>

  <p>The movements displayed by Woolley were unfamiliar to Zheng. However, Zheng's comprehension of swordsmanship had already reached the level of Ripping Consciousness. He had long since far surpassed the level of a grand master and had profound insight about swordsmanship. He could tell with a single glance that this set of sword skills was extremely simple and crude. A chuckle almost escaped Zheng's lips as he was amused by the sight in front of him.</p>

  <p>'It seems that these divine citizens aren't more advanced than secondary creatures in every aspect. Their swordsmanship could really use some improvements, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Let alone a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, even an ordinary Life and Death Realm or Soul Sea Realm warrior from his universe could be regarded as a grand master of swordsmanship. Most warriors from Zheng's universe practiced many sets of excellent sword skills.</p>
