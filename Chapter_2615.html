</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God was none other than Wayne, the Big Mouth whom Zheng had released from the dungeon of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He and Master Evil were known for their very bad reputation in the divine land. After Master Evil was released, he had been anxious to call back his original followers and relive his past glory. Thus, he naturally hurried back to the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Wayne had stayed in the Cyan Demon Region and gathered a group of outlaws in the region to form his own force.</p>

  <p>The Cyan Demon Region was barren, but he was very happy these days.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it wasn't a coincidence for him to meet the woman there.</p>

  <p>He had been imprisoned in the fairy palace for so long, and he knew that the only habitable place in the Swirl Forest was the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>So when he heard the woman in front of him say so, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I only know there is a fairy palace in the Swirl Forest," the woman replied, her lips pressed into a thin line.</p>

  <p>"Is there a fairy palace in the forbidden area?"</p>

  <p>"The Swirl Forest is full of fierce beasts. Who could possibly build a fairy palace there?"</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Once again, the malicious men around them burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>Although those men knew that the woman belonged to their leader, it was okay for them to mock her before their leader had his way with her.</p>

  <p>When Wayne heard those words, he was sure that she was Zheng's woman.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng had released them from the dungeon, both Wayne and Master Evil had taken an oath by their inner demons that they would be loyal to Zheng forever.</p>

  <p>Of course, it did not mean that Wayne couldn't eat this woman. After all, his oath was that he must be loyal to Zheng, not the people around him.</p>

  <p>Yet, he didn't dare to do so.</p>

  <p>He knew very well how truly powerful Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the son of Holy Mike and the disciple of Holy Bromley.</p>

  <p>If Wayne really ate this woman and Zheng found out, he would surely end up in misery.</p>

  <p>Besides, he was highly ferocious, but not ungrateful.</p>

  <p>It was because of Zheng that he had gotten to leave that damned dungeon which had imprisoned him for several divine eras.</p>

  <p>If he could send the woman to the fairy palace and return her to Zheng, then Zheng would be grateful to him. Perhaps, Zheng would even thank him by saying that the oath was no longer valid.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he grinned and asked, "Is the man in the fairy palace you mentioned called  Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>The woman, who had been very desperate, suddenly looked stunned and nodded. Her watery eyes stared at his ugly face in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Leader, is there really such a person?" asked the mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Wayne nodded and said, "That man…helped me before." "Really?"</p>

  <p>The woman, who had looked like she was going to end, was now filled with excitement.</p>

  <p>She had never thought that things would turn around this time.</p>

  <p>"I can take you to the Swirl Forest, but this forest is a forbidden area of the divine land. I can't guarantee if I can enter there.</p>

  <p>I can only take you to try our luck," said Wayne.</p>

  <p>What he said was true. There had been weird changes in the Swirl Forest recently, while an abnormal phenomenon had transpired in the entire Cyan Demon Region for several days.</p>

  <p>The Swirl Forest was a forbidden area and one could exit it from any area, but they could only enter from the entrance. Once the entrance was sealed, they could only enter it through the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>So he was unable to bring this woman inside.</p>

  <p>Then again, given that Holy Bromley was so powerful and the fairy palace was in the forest, they could always take a chance.</p>

  <p>The woman was overjoyed to hear his words.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Wayne's followers were utterly speechless. They had never thought that the woman who appeared out of nowhere had something to do with their leader.</p>

  <p>Deep in the Swirl Forest was a beautiful emerald green lake.</p>

  <p>It was like a gem that was embedded in the center of the forest.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the gem-like lake floated a golden "bobber," which exuded a strong, medicinal scent that attracted many fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>There was something in the lake that played with the bobber and caused it to rise and fall constantly.</p>

  <p>In addition, there was a transparent fish line connected to the bobber.</p>

  <p>The fish line extended all the way to the bank of the lake, to the jungle, and extended over 10, 000 miles all the way to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Today, Yudie and the others all stayed in the training tower and couldn't leave it.</p>

  <p>The entire fairy palace was filled with intense blood, and its strong and tangy odor permeated everywhere.</p>

  <p>The square in front of the fairy palace was littered with broken wings, birds' bones, apes' broken arms which were several thousand feet long, broken skulls, and even crushed brains that were scattered all over the place.</p>

  <p>Anyone with a weak mind would vomit at the disgusting scene.</p>

  <p>In the center of the square was Harold, who had taken off his shirt.</p>

  <p>He was handsome and had a well-defined body, but now all his muscles were swollen. The blood that flowed in his blood vessels was of various colors.</p>

  <p>An extremely powerful and tyrannical force circulated in his body like mad and emitted an incomparably strong aura.</p>

  <p>"I've got rid of this batch of beasts," he said in a voice that reached the fairy palace, as he clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>At the pavilion in the fairy palace was Hallet, who held a fish rod in his hand. He quietly gazed into the distance, but he couldn't hide his nervousness. "We can't disturb the thing in the lake, and don't disturb Augustus. Not even a single move. Master Joy, keep on sending those beasts to the fairy palace!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>The last time they tried to gain control of the Swirl Forest had failed.</p>

  <p>After Harold took Yan to the fairy palace, Hallet changed the plan, in which Harold played an extremely important role.</p>

  <p>A woman who was over 10, 000 miles away from the fairy palace stood on her tiptoes on the top of a tree. She was none other than Joy.</p>

  <p>From her point of view, she could see tens of thousands of beasts that all rushed towards the lake from all directions.</p>

  <p>Those fierce creatures were the most powerful creatures in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>There were blood and even golden apes, and a flock of Swirl Birds thousands of feet long that flew in the sky, which the consummate True Gods found difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>Of course, she had arranged everything beforehand.</p>

  <p>She had created the Purple Sky Land, which had completely isolated the entire lake from the outside.</p>

  <p>The exit of the Purple Sky Land was connected to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"All right!"</p>

  <p>Joy answered and nodded. At that point, waves of purple light spread out everywhere.</p>

  <p>The light waves immediately enveloped numerous vicious creatures in the Purple Sky Land.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, an overwhelming amount of beasts were moved to the huge square of the fairy palace in an instant.</p>

  <p>All the beasts that charged towards the lake were now taken into the fairy palace for Harold to kill.</p>

  <p>Harold would also rely on the fairy palace's own array. After all, he was the one who had been the most pressured. Moreover, he had already killed countless vicious beasts in the past few days.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p id="top_18">The power in his body suddenly erupted, and he killed all those beasts in the blink of an eye. It was as easy as crushing dry weeds!</p>
