<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 679 Ning Yudie‘s Little Secret (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although the old lady looked to be senile, there was breathtaking force in her cloudy eyes. Her halting steps seemed like they concealed profound skills.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng heard Ning Yudie call the old lady master, he did not understand who she was. In fact, the old woman was the one behind the success of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie had such a great talent that she had almost finished the final stage of the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, which was the top method skill, she was still too lightweight for the position of head of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The old lady didn't respond to Yudie's greeting but said to Luo Zheng, "You are only a disciple of the Elite House. How dare you question the head of Cloud Hall to her face? Enlighten me!" The old lady then turned to Ning Yudie. "Tia, you have made a mistake. How can you stand there and allow a disciple of the Elite House to speak like this? Don't you think you are losing face here, as the head of Cloud Hall? What about your authority? You, the head of Cloud Hall, actually apologized to him!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie opened her mouth, wanting to point out to her master that Luo Zheng was quite unusual. However, she was afraid that her master would then ask her why.</p>

  <p>Why was Luo Zheng so unusual? She could not answer such a question. She never insisted on her authority before Luo Zheng. That was the reason why Luo Zheng was different... But if she really said that, her master would have all the more reason to admonish her.</p>

  <p>"Eddie Cui plans to set the Lustful Demon Array to break through the limitations of death. He wants to find three warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm. Each of the warriors must have a Purple Power Body, which is rare," the old lady said to Luo Zheng in a hoarse voice. "The Purple Power Body is exceptional, but it is uncommon. What's more impossible is that Eddie wants three of them! But he has finally found two. One is your sister, Yan Luo, and the other Marilyn Si. If Eddie can find another one, he can use his Lustful Demon Array with success. Marilyn will take part in the Martial Arts Contest as Eddie's disciple. If you are powerful enough, you can kill her at the contest."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng's eyes sparked with excitement.</p>

  <p>Was it true that the other warrior with a Purple Power Body would attend the Martial Arts Contest?</p>

  <p>A Purple Power Body was rare and out of the ordinary. Eddie would not be looking for the last one even till now, after preparing for the Lustful Demon Array for so long, if that wasn't the case.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng managed to kill Marilyn, it would surely spoil Eddie's plan, or at least delay it.</p>

  <p>Facing Eddie, who was too powerful, he could not defeat him now. Luo Zheng felt helpless at the prospect of fighting him.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng's cultivation base was powerful enough to fight Eddie, the latter would have probably found the third warrior who had the Purple Power Body. He would have successfully completed his Lustful Demon Array.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned that I could kill Marilyn? What is her cultivation level?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"She's at the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm," the old lady replied to him, her face unreadable.</p>

  <p>At these words, Zheng's lips twisted. Although he had flown to the Upper World through the Dragon Soar Arena and his power and cultivation level had greatly improved, he was still not certain about killing a warrior who was at middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>"If you do not want to face her, get out of here. Don't hesitate like a coward.</p>

  <p>You don't have the right to blame others, including my Tia," the old lady said in an unfriendly tone. She was still not happy that Luo Zheng had forced Tia to apologize to him.</p>

  <p>"Is killing others at the Martial Arts Contest allowed?" Luo Zheng threw her another question.</p>

  <p>The old lady smiled coldly. "The upcoming Martial Arts Contest is not a game. You think it will be the same as the All Peaks Competition of Cloud Sect? How wrong you are! The contest is not for the faint-hearted!"</p>

  <p>The fights of the sect were merely hints to real battles outside. Although there were people who got hurt in the fight or even died, for most of the participants, the fights were like games. Usually, they did not kill their opponents.</p>

  <p>But the Martial Arts Contest was an entirely different ballgame.</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge that a number of warriors were killed every decade at the Martial Arts Contest of Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The warriors were from different sects. They were unaware of each other's identities. They showed no mercy at the Martial Arts Contest. It was all about fighting duals.</p>

  <p>The winner went onward and upwards. If one lost, however, he was under the mercy of the winner. If the latter was kind enough or in a good mood, he might spare the loser's life. Otherwise, the loser would be killed straightaway without being shown any sympathy.</p>

  <p>In short, the Martial Arts Contest was a field for gladiator battles. Due to the Dragon Soar Arena, each sect paid more attention to the Martial Arts Contest. They were more eager to win the top spot. It was but natural that the contest was very fierce.</p>

  <p>Someone once remarked that the Martial Arts Contest held by the World Commercial Alliance every decade or so was a small-scale sectarian war. It was an opportunity to test the strengths of each sect in peacetime.</p>

  <p>"Are there any conditions for a warrior to attend the Martial Arts Contest?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng voiced out another question.</p>

  <p>Before her master could get in a word, Ning Yudie demanded, her eyebrows furrowing, "Are you planning on attending it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am!" Luo Zheng looked at Ning Yudie, determination etched across his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had always been planning to take part in the Martial Arts Contest. He was already a member of the Dragon Lineage Human. That was to say he belonged to the Dragon Abyss Palace. He was dependent on the Dragon Soar Arena if he wanted to fly to the Genuine Dragon World. It was obvious that the arena was crucial to him.</p>
