<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1346 Control The Light Dots </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The other warriors of the Weapon House didn't know what was going on.</p>

  <p>They felt that it was very easy for Luo Zheng to keep ascending higher and higher.</p>

  <p>In addition to the white-eyebrowed elder, Rhydian also found the whole thing pretty mysterious.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Rhydian flew higher off the ground, he had also deliberately suppressed a portion of his strength. He did this because he wanted to conserve his strength in order to use it after reaching a certain height. So his purpose was different from Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Despite deliberately restraining his strength, he would still be suppressed by the gravitational force after reaching this desired height. But he couldn't be as calm and composed as Luo Zheng and maintain a uniform speed.</p>

  <p>Judging by this, Zheng's strength was far from reaching its limit!</p>

  <p>One hundred and fifty feet, one hundred and sixty feet...</p>

  <p>Small white light dots were jumping around Luo Zheng haphazardly. Within these dots lay second-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Some light dots even landed on Zheng's face. If he reached out to grab them, he could get them easily.</p>

  <p>However, he continued to raise his head, and the chaotic energy within his body spun more wildly...</p>

  <p>Second-rank divine weapons existed at one hundred and sixty feet above the ground, while the secondary first-rank divine weapons were located at a height of one hundred and eighty feet.</p>

  <p>There were only four red light dots at a height of one hundred and ninety feet. These red dots signified the first-rank divine weapons that Rhydian had paid for. They cost him four hundred life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>The only divine weapon that Luo Zheng had chosen, with a blue light dot, floated at a height of two hundred feet. The blue light dot was constantly dancing close to the ceiling of the dome...</p>

  <p>"Rise..."</p>

  <p>The gravitational force was also getting stronger and stronger now!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was finding it hard to move up now. However, he maintained a delicate balance and made his chaotic energy spin faster and faster. At the same time, he used the power of the dragon scales to resist the gravitational pull.</p>

  <p>The dragon scales within his body lit up one by one like a string of lights.</p>

  <p>Five hundred dragon scales...</p>

  <p>One thousand...</p>

  <p>Two thousand...</p>

  <p>When four thousand dragon scales were activated, he had already reached a height of one hundred and ninety feet!</p>

  <p>If he moved horizontally at this moment, he could have pursued the four first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>"This guy's real target is the Thunder Wind Divine Sword..."</p>

  <p>"Actually, if he grabs a first-rank divine weapon, he would make a fortune! But this guy seems to be unsatisfied with those divine weapons."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! He has the ability to chase the better weapon, so surely he would not pick the worse one."</p>

  <p>The warriors had already gauged that Luo Zheng possessed the strength to do so!</p>

  <p>Rhydian had also reached a height of about a hundred and ninety feet in the past, only a hair's breadth away from a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However, he managed to stay at that height for a very short duration of time, so he didn't have the power to chase the red light dots.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was able to stabilize himself at a height of one hundred and ninety feet. He was merely ten feet away from the dome!</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had forgotten about everything else, and his eyes were only fixed on the blue light dot, which was dancing in the air!</p>

  <p>However, just reaching this height was not enough. The light dots would not remain still. They were like tiny fireflies that danced constantly.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the speed at which the dots were dancing was not too fast. With their quick reflexes, warriors would be able to easily catch the dancing lights even if they moved ten times faster than their current speed.</p>

  <p>However, with this gravitational force, if one let his guard down and his strength dropped even a little bit, he would be directly pulled down by the gravity. So one could imagine the challenges of catching these light dots.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng caught sight of the light dot, he let out a big sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was truly difficult to obtain. When Luo Zheng was only thirty feet away from the dome, the gravitational force doubled, and it kept doubling every ten feet. He had to double the power of the dragon scales to deal with the gravitational force in the final stretch.</p>

  <p>If the gravitational force doubled once more when he reached a height of two hundred feet, he would probably be unable to withstand it.</p>

  <p>This was because Zheng's physical body could bear the power of about six thousand dragon scales at the most.</p>

  <p>He could of course activate the power of eight thousand dragon scales, but his own body would not be able to withstand this surge...</p>

  <p>He would be risking it all!</p>

  <p>It had not been easy to reach this height, and Luo Zheng certainly did not want to return empty-handed. If it was just about safety, he could choose any one of the four first-rank divine weapons. However, since he had set a goal for himself, there was no excuse for him to not achieve it, no matter how difficult the goal seemed to be.</p>

  <p>He never feared challenges. A warrior could only become more powerful by facing and overcoming challenges!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had suddenly activated more than six thousand dragon scales in his body!</p>

  <p>The power rapidly surged through his limbs and bones. At the same time, a crackling sound erupted from within his body once again.</p>

  <p>"It seems like he has activated some kind of a secret technique!"</p>

  <p>"This guy probably doesn't know that in this dome, the more powerful one's own strength is, the greater the force of gravity that the dome will subject him to!"</p>

  <p>"Just wait and watch. Whether he succeeds or not depends on his performance at this moment. However, I admire his courage whether he is successful or not. At least he has the courage to try to obtain the weapon left behind by the previous leader right after entering the Mist Palace..."</p>

  <p>It was just as the warriors had said, the gravity rapidly increased after Zheng's power erupted.</p>

  <p>However, the gravitational pull didn't increase as fast as Zheng's speed!</p>

  <p>That was because Luo Zheng had used the chaotic energy in his body to invoke the Wind Law, and at the same time, his forceful energy also began to erupt.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was no longer focusing on maintaining his slow rising speed. Under this eruption, the speed at which he rose had increased several times!</p>

  <p>"Such a strong gravitational force!"</p>

  <p>At this height, the surrounding space started to become extremely viscous under the influence of the powerful gravity. Luo Zheng felt like he was floating through a quagmire. Every breath of air was like wet mud pressing down onto his body.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was as nimble as a squirrel. Now he didn't rush upwards desperately, but instead he changed his direction, dashing forward at a slanted angle. Then he twisted his body, and once again increased his altitude!</p>

  <p>After a few similar twists and turns, he finally reached the ceiling!</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Weapon House had stopped talking. Some had even clenched their fists anxiously. The scene in front of them was truly inconceivable. After all, the weapons of the Weapon House were notoriously difficult to obtain.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they also felt lucky to have witnessed this scene. After all, some warriors had managed to take the first-rank divine weapons, but the former leaders' weapons hadn't been taken away by anyone in the past.</p>

  <p>Being witnesses to this scene gave them bragging rights in front of their friends for a year...</p>

  <p>Zheng's body stabilized at a height of two hundred feet. He knew that if he relaxed even slightly, his efforts would be for naught and he would fall straight to the ground like Rhydian.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after reaching this height, he concentrated all of his energy on resisting the force of gravity and did not rush to chase after the blue light dot.</p>

  <p>The blue light dot continued to flutter about without any care.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, it would move closer to Luo Zheng to tempt him but just as it came close to him, it suddenly leaped away.</p>

  <p>Three seconds...</p>

  <p>Six seconds...</p>

  <p>Zheng's breathing became heavier and more strained.</p>

  <p>His physical body had already reached the limit at which he could bear the power. If he were to increase the power by even the slightest bit, it would break his physical body and he would come smashing down to the ground.</p>

  <p>"He is lost in thought even at a height of two hundred feet. This guy is really strange..."</p>

  <p>"He is probably concentrating on that blue light dot. Hovering at the height of two hundred feet is just too scary. Right now it's like he's walking on a tightrope. He can slow down. After all he can still withstand it, but he can't make any mistakes. Otherwise he'll just fall down!"</p>

  <p>"But even if he moves slowly, there must be a limit. He's just standing still there!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the white-eyebrowed elder was already standing and looking at Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>A thought suddenly appeared in the white-eyebrowed elder's mind. He did not think that Luo Zheng would obtain this Thunder Wind Divine Sword so easily. He wanted to see the limit of Zheng's strength!</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder had personally set up these light dots. If he wanted, he could easily control them.</p>

  <p>He didn't mean to make things difficult for Luo Zheng. It was just that he was really curious and wanted to see whether Luo Zheng could hold on or not...</p>
