  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Long live King Orlando!"</p>

  <p>"Long live King Orlando!"</p>

  <p>"Long live King Orlando!"</p>

  <p>Witnessing their king achieve an undisputed victory, the Monkey Masters jumped and cheered as they were consumed with pride gushing from every fiber of their beings.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed with their sense of achievement, Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar beat on their chests as hard as they could in unison, making rhythmic sounds like drums.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess glanced in the direction of the overly excited Monkey Masters and shook her head in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Even though they were frighteningly powerful, the Monkey Masters were almost mindless. What was there to be so enthusiastic about?</p>

  <p>How could they celebrate like this? It could not be counted as a victory unless they were successful in removing the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>A while ago, before Eastern Emperor Taiyi decided to sacrifice his life, he asked, "Let's suppose our surprise attack worked, and we managed to kill the Snake Spirit King with the Monkey Spirit King's power. What's next for us? What would be our next step?"</p>

  <p>"We'll just have to keep fighting. I'm certain. He will revive again at his coordinates," the Snake Goddess replied with confidence.</p>

  <p>"If that's how it is, won't my sacrifice be in vain?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as he furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>At his innocent question, the Snake Goddess let out a light chuckle before glancing back at him. "If we're all destined to die anyway, your sacrifice would be inevitable. You're only embracing your death earlier than the rest of us so you could buy Luo Zheng some more time."</p>

  <p>Agreeing to her statement, the Primeval Lord of Heaven gave a slight nod and spoke, "Once the Snake Spirit King dies, the remaining Snake Masters and Treacherous Beings will be utterly panicked. Once that happens, we will try to kill as many of them as we can. Then, both them and the Snake Spirit King will take a while to gather together again after they are revived. In this way, we'll be able to buy enough time for Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi listened to their conclusions with his utmost attention. He remained quiet as he stared into the space ahead. His demeanor remained calm, and he showed no signs of backing down at that point. With unwavering resolve, he was prepared to sacrifice his existence to help them achieve their ultimate victory.</p>

  <p>After recalling how they had planned before Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Snake Goddess turned to address the others. "Everyone, it won't be long before the reanimation of the Snake Spirit King occurs. Before that happens, we must defeat the Snake Masters all!" Her tone was brimming with determination as she roused them all up for the challenge that awaited them.</p>

  <p>In response to her words, Alphonse, Hamilton, and other human spirits nodded and raised their fists in the air before they screamed, "Yeah! We can't just let a rare opportunity like this slip by! Let's kill them all!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After having their spirits lifted, the human spirits charged forward towards their enemies from the altar.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters who were too busy beating their chests and celebrating suddenly stopped in their tracks as they paused to watch the human spirits rush towards their enemies. Witnessing their tenacity, they felt their fighting spirit reignite and take control of their bodies as they followed after them to offer their assistance in their conquest.</p>

  <p>At this scene, Lawler, Duran, Orval and other Bird Masters hovering in the air let out shrieks of delight as they aimed themselves towards the Snake Masters and shot down like sharp arrows piercing away at their enemy's flesh.</p>

  <p>The sudden death of the Snake Spirit King left Sewell stunned for a significant amount of time.</p>

  <p>When he regained his senses, he realized they were fighting a war that would result in a terrible loss for them since they were rendered vulnerable without their king.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>Thinking quick, he began to let out a series of sounds that were unique to the snake spirits to discretely instruct them on what they should do.</p>

  <p>"All of you, retreat!"</p>

  <p>The sturdy body of the Snake Spirit King had been obliterated, and it wouldn't be wise of them to keep fighting a battle they would eventually lose.</p>

  <p>Even though at this moment, all odds were stacked up against them, it didn't matter.</p>

  <p>All they had to do was hold them off and buy enough time for their king to be revived to snatch their lost advantage in the war.</p>

  <p id="top_23">"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>Each of them began to wriggle away from their enemies in an attempt to escape and split in all directions, all the while maintaining their incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Although their movements were significantly agile, the human spirits and the monkey spirits were by no means slow, and the Bird Masters were especially quicker than all of them.</p>

  <p>Lawler, Duran, and all the others had harbored strong feelings of hatred towards the Snake Spirit Sect. Now, when finally met with an opportunity to channel their resentment in the worst way possible, they were not going to hold back.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the battle raged on, bolts of lightning and pillars of light contributed to the hues of the space around them as they clashed against each other along with a vivid contrast of the bloody mist erupting from the bodies of the dead and the wounded.</p>

  <p>The mountains that surrounded the altar collapsed helplessly, unable to withstand the overwhelming energy colliding and tampering with the atmosphere, the earth cracked wide open after having endured several jolts of exploding pressure. The energy waves that were produced from both sides created wild surges of energy like those of seawater.</p>

  <p>Rays of Light of Annihilation swept across the ground, disposing of the Treacherous Beings in their path like insignificant obstructions.</p>

  <p>Although Sewell ordered the snake spirits to retreat ahead of time, they failed to follow through with his instructions unscathed.</p>

  <p>Under the relentless efforts of their enemies to chase them down to their deaths, about seventy percent of the snake spirits were wiped out.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful or experienced Sewell was, he was unable to escape from the clutches of the Monkey Spirit King. Just as he attempted to flee into the earth, the mighty Monkey Spirit King raised his feet and stomped hard on the ground, cracking it wide open from the sheer force, leaving Sewell nowhere to go. Ambushed and surrounded from all sides, Sewell was pulled out mercilessly.</p>
