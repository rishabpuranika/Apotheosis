<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2043 An Earthworm </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Some of the Sacred Supreme Lords were absolutely loyal to Maha. Some of them remained neutral, and some held great hostility toward Maha.</p>

  <p>After all, the internal forces of the Sacred race were extremely complicated? they weren't as united as it seemed.</p>

  <p>But everyone still had absolute confidence in Maha.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe, Maha's reputation was simply too great. From the moment this fellow was born, he constantly created miracles.</p>

  <p>But as the Sacred Supreme Lords saw his fight against Luo Luo Zheng, their confidence in Maha suddenly began to waver.</p>

  <p>None of Luo Zheng's strikes contained any special laws or Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike contained only Luo Zheng's comprehension of the Divine Dao? it had displayed the peak-level of sword intent. In terms of pure power of the Gods-intimidating Strike, it was already comparable to that of Yao's Profound Holy Thunder, equal to a Supreme Lord's full attack.</p>

  <p>But even a Supreme Lord couldn't recklessly unleash such a terrifying attack such as Luo Zheng's. He employed the Gods-intimidating strike with ease and it wasn't a problem for him to strike relentlessly. If he intended to do so, the several hundred strikes would be enough to shatter the very supreme world to pieces.</p>

  <p>"This Godly Genius? he's exceeded our expectations," a Supreme Lord said, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had long been prepared to invade the Evolutionary Universe. In their first year there, they made no move. Instead, they were busy collecting information from the Evolutionary Universe, analyzing the function of every single Supreme Lord's Heavenly Destiny, their true strength, the conflicts between the races, and so on? anything they could get their hands on.</p>

  <p>Even Murphy had warned the Sacred race to pay special attention to these Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe? they managed to collect tons of detailed information regarding the ten Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>This included their races, ages, strengths, personalities, experiences, Divine Dao, cultivation methods, and so on.</p>

  <p>But back then, none of the ten had entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Sacred race had not compared the strength of the Godly Geniuses to that of Maha, and Godly Geniuses such as Luo Luo Zheng and Nathan were only at the Soul Sea Realm at that time.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Luo Zheng and the other Godly Geniuses returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, their strengths had advanced by leaps and bounds. The Sacred race had to have a new evaluation of these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Forcefully raising one's cultivation could cause one's level to destabilize.</p>

  <p>And these Godly Geniuses had just become world lords? compared to Maha, they were still as young and tender as baby birds. In the hearts of these Sacred Supreme Lords, they still weren't quite powerful enough to pose any real threat.</p>

  <p>But now, the strength Luo Luo Zheng had displayed completely overturned their logic.</p>

  <p>"His strength? It goes far beyond our imagination!" Supreme Lord Barrie's eyes were filled with shock. A feeling overcame him, telling him that it would be difficult for him to take the kid down.</p>

  <p>"I've been to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land before. It didn't seem all that magical?" A Sacred Supreme Lord shook his head in thought.</p>

  <p>"Everyone's experiences are different. We have no way of knowing what happened to them. Right now, I'm worried that Maha might be defeated?"</p>

  <p>In the end, the Supreme Lords were merely secondary creatures. The way they saw things and their knowledge were limited to the universes.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they didn't know the true secrets of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and couldn't figure out the treatment Luo Luo Zheng and the others had received there. For instance, Luo Luo Zheng himself had personally received guidance from the two Holy beings, Holy Jay and Holy Drew. Tianming, Nathan, and the other Godly Geniuses also received special treatments that wouldn't have come easy to ordinary cultivators.</p>

  <p>In the Dead Water World, the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were giddy with excitement.</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord of Original Sin, who wore a gloomy face most of the time, had a look of admiration in his eyes. In the Dead Water World, he had seen Luo Luo Zheng collect the corpse fragments of the Silver Moon Wolves? he was aware that Luo Luo Zheng was doing so for Nathan's sake. He had even asked Supreme Lord Lester whether or not he could revive Nathan in such a case.</p>

  <p>But Supreme Lord Lester didn't have much confidence. In theory, so long as he could gather all the pieces of Nathan's flesh body, he could revive him completely. The Heavenly Destiny of Revival was extremely powerful. Unless one's death was caused by the Five Aging Processes, any other form of death could be dealt with so that the person could be revived.</p>

  <p>But the Silver Moon Wolves had already swallowed Nathan's corpse. If they had completely digested the corpse fragments, that would have made any chance of revival even slimmer.</p>

  <p>Still, Supreme Lord Lester's response gave Supreme Lord of Original Sin a glimmer of hope, lifting his spirits.</p>

  <p>But his hatred towards Maha didn't give in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Only because he feared the Sacred Supreme Lords behind Maha did he forcefully suppress the urge to kill him.</p>

  <p>Now that he saw Luo Luo Zheng display such powerful strength and completely suppress Maha, he was truly overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Master Feng, it seems like the information you've given us isn't wholly accurate. Is this boy truly weaker than a low-rank Supreme Lord?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum inquired with a smile.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng gained the upper hand, the initially solemn atmosphere seemed to lighten and relax as the Supreme Lords grew more optimistic.</p>

  <p>"Weaker than a low-rank Supreme Lord? Luo Zheng's current strength is probably enough to enable him to contend against a mid-rank Supreme Lord. At the very least, I have no confidence to defeat him!" a Supreme Lord from the Blessed Buddha Land chimed in.</p>

  <p>"That's not the case. In terms of overall strength, Luo Luo Zheng is indeed formidable, but in the end, he does not have a Heavenly Destiny. Some of these destinies are unreasonable and extremely powerful," another Supreme Lord remarked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, the power of us Supreme Lords is not only reflected in our cultivation and knowledge. We rely most on the Heavenly Destinies, after all."</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords began arguing over Luo Zheng's strength. But the topic of this debate had changed from whether or not Luo Luo Zheng could defeat Maha, to whether or not Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to contend against Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>But as they debated the matter, a blazing white light suddenly flashed from close by. Then, a space crack appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>From the space crack stepped out Xun, Supreme Lord Leroy, Supreme Lord Leia, and other Demon Night Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>While Xun led the Demon Night Supreme Lords to the Dead Water World, Luo Luo Zheng had used the Teleportation Token to enter straight into the Sunflower Water World. Supreme Lord Mathias and the rest of the ogre race, along with everyone else, arrived ahead.</p>

  <p>The moment Xun appeared, she gave Master Feng a light nod before greeting the many Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Celestial Position had also come to know of what happened in the Demon Night. They informed the rest of the Supreme Lords who then decided to forget about the Demon Night race's attitude towards them before. The fact that they came to assist them gained their welcome and gratitude. Now, the different races of the Evolutionary Universe were united as they had mobilized all the forces available.</p>

  <p>After the Supreme Lords exchanged greetings with the Demon Night Supreme Lords, they continued discussing their troublesome matters.</p>

  <p>When Xun overheard the conversation, her pointed ears twitched, and a smile found its way to her face.</p>

  <p>Could Luo Luo Zheng kill a Supreme Lord? Perhaps it was time to discuss how many of them Luo Luo Zheng could kill.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had used the Death Chain to brutally beat Supreme Lord Shadow. If it weren't for Ying who had used the Link of Life on him, Supreme Lord Shadow would have been killed by Luo Luo Zheng ten times over.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Luo Zheng still had difficulty completely taking the life of a Supreme Lord. But later on, when Mike appeared and took Luo Luo Zheng away, the latter managed to master the Enemy Repelling Arts. Now, he possessed the ability to break causality, and his abilities had become even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>For instance, since a Law of Causality such as the Five Aging Processes could be broken by Luo Luo Zheng in a single slash, the Crowns of Destiny that these Supreme Lords had carried were nothing impressive next to such a feat.</p>

  <p>But of course, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't yet fought a Supreme Lord since then and Xun couldn't jump to any conclusions. The Supreme Lords were debating this matter on their own and she meant not to join them. So long as the Supreme Lords didn't perish, they'd eventually see Luo Luo Zheng taking on a Supreme Lord...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the battle, he slashed over twenty times.</p>

  <p>While the Gods-intimidating Strike was famous for its great power, it wasn't particularly fast. Because Maha could travel fast underground, he managed to escape the attacks.</p>

  <p>But the World Tree in Luo Zheng's inner world had already taken root in other areas outside the inner world, relentlessly absorbing chaotic energy. It was inexhaustible and never could it be drained.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng launched such consecutive attacks to deter his opponent.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Maha could only groan and run around underground.</p>

  <p>After dashing several dozens of miles underground, Maha could no longer hold on. Suddenly, he stopped and the layer of earth in front of him began to crack open. Sword intent shot down before his eyes, piercing through the ground and creating a bottomless crack in front of him.</p>

  <p>Light shone through and when Maha raised his head, he saw Luo Luo Zheng, high up in the sky.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the two looked at each other. Luo Luo Zheng, wielding the Great Weighty Sword in his hand, smiled faintly. "Are you an earthworm?"</p>

  <p>Faced with such provocation, Maha's expression turned determined. The blade in his hand suddenly twisted until a deep purple light spread from it.</p>
