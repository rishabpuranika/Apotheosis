<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tentacles quickly transformed after being cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>Each piece morphed into the shape of a five-pointed star. A crack then appeared in the center and an eye popped out of it.</p>

  <p>The pieces now looked like starfish.</p>

  <p>The starfish searched around for a second before locking onto the Primeval Lord of Heaven as their target. Their mission when they had entered the Deleting Space had been to retrieve the Heart of Limit that Luo Nian had taken.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All the starfish swept towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Seeing them surging towards him didn't scare him in the slightest. He flew upside down, dodging and weaving, leaving mere shadows behind him.</p>

  <p>Ziya's face darkened further on seeing the starfish giving chase. Once more, he extended his arm out and cut through the air.</p>

  <p>Space cutters appeared one after the other behind the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The starfish passed through thousands of space cutters and were again cut into even smaller pieces.</p>

  <p>The starfish that were once the size of a fist were now no more than powder.</p>

  <p>But they remained tenacious and energetic, continuing to charge after the Primeval Lord of Heaven even after being turned into powder. They looked like dark brown poisonous smog as they stuck close behind him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps on realizing that individually they were too small to inflict any real damage, they had evolved toxins within the tiny organisms to make up for their size.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven circled the Deleting Pillars and then passed by Zhurong and said flatly, "Burn them."</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>A scorching flame suddenly ignited, immediately burning the entire poisonous smog following behind the Primeval Lord of Heaven, leaving behind only the pungent smell of charred meat.</p>

  <p>Dealing with such a dilemma as this was a simple task for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others as they had experienced numerous battles.</p>

  <p>But the appearance of these monsters in the Abstruse Energy World put them slightly on edge.</p>

  <p>"Are there other creatures in the Abstruse Energy World?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Ziya nodded.</p>

  <p>He had been here for a long time, and in that time other creatures had attacked this place.</p>

  <p>The first was a sort of "light" creature. It didn't have a form, but was simply a special kind of light. It did not attack Ziya and the others but reproduced endlessly as soon as they entered the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Soon the "light" creatures could be found all across the Deleting Space, and they proved difficult to get rid of by normal methods. Ziya had tried many means before finally succeeding in driving the "light" creatures away.</p>

  <p>The second attack involved these tentacles.</p>

  <p>This was not Ziya's first encounter with them. When he had seen the "mountain" for the first time, he sensed something special inside it. At that time, he knew little of the Abstruse Energy World, so he was unable to determine what it was.</p>

  <p>And as soon as he returned to the cave, he was strangled in a tangle of these tentacles.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had reacted quickly and gotten rid of them. If they had pulled him into the Abstruse Energy World, he might not have been able to fight them off despite his great strength.</p>

  <p>After that incident, he didn't dare to enter the Abstruse Energy World for a long time.</p>

  <p>He never saw the tentacles again when he finally decided to enter the "mountain" again.</p>

  <p>It now seemed that those tentacles had moved to the grassland mentioned by Luo Nian, and the Heart of Limit that Luo Nian had unintentionally taken, very likely belonged to them.</p>

  <p>For them, to enter the chaos rashly was a very risky move, but they took the risk to get the Heart of Limit back.</p>

  <p>"The Abstruse Energy World is not lifeless. It may be difficult to comprehend, but it is very lively," Ziya deduced.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded with gratification. Among his twelve disciples, Ziya's personality was the most similar to his. He was good at deduction and planning. It seemed destined that Ziya had been deleted to this space.</p>

  <p>"It seems that our hope lies in the Abstruse Energy World," declared the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"But Ziya, you explored too slowly. It has been many years and you still cannot even perform as well as a child," the Snake Goddess retorted mercilessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian and Luo Zheng were approaching gingerly when they heard the Snake Goddess' words. "I'm not a child, Snake Goddess!" Luo Nian corrected.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled faintly. She saw little difference between Luo Zheng's and Luo Nian's ages. They were both children to her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am simply not talented enough," Ziya sighed. He looked at Luo Nian again and his eyes flashed with hope.</p>

  <p>He had been here for so many years and still was not able to even cross a river yet. In contrast, Luo Nian had done it with ease. It seemed that if Luo Nian was given time, he would be able to travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, you're talented enough to travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World. Would you care to stay here and help us?" Ziya asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's eyes flickered.</p>

  <p>Even if Ziya hadn't asked this of him, he would still ask his father for permission to stay.</p>

  <p>He had been longing to leave his father's inner world and the first time he stepped into the Abstruse Energy World, he had felt abnormally satisfied, as if he belonged in the world.</p>

  <p>It was a feeling he would never forget for as long as he lived.</p>

  <p>Although he already wanted to stay here, he still could not miss this opportunity to take advantage of the situation. "Yes I would, but I have conditions."</p>

  <p>"Oh? What conditions, Luo Nian?" Ziya asked smiling.</p>

  <p>If Luo Nian was willing to stay, he would agree with whatever conditions he had.</p>

  <p>After thinking a moment, Luo Nian said, "I want a palace of the same size, and..."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's request was not excessive or difficult to fulfill by using the resources in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>"I can grant you all you wish," Ziya said without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Worry appeared on Luo Zheng's face, who had been silent the entire time until he asked, "Although he can travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World, is it not dangerous for him?"</p>

  <p>The monsters in the Abstruse Energy World might even break into the Deleting Space. If Luo Nian encountered them in the Abstruse Energy World, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>"Dad!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's eyebrows shot up like sharp swords.</p>

  <p>Leaving Luo Zheng's inner world was not easy for him, how could he be willing to return there?</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Nian's determination reminded Luo Zheng of himself. He realized it might not be that easy to get his son to compromise. Luo Zheng sighed and said,</p>

  <p>"Your decision is fine with me, but as for your mother..."</p>

  <p>"Just don't tell her. Isn't the Deleting Space very safe?" Luo Nian asked in a hurry, trying to convince his father.</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best to keep him safe. He's truly very important," Ziya said enthusiastically, standing by their side.</p>

  <p>Ziya still had many questions and theories about the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He even had a theory that there could be another cave just like theirs and another world too.</p>

  <p>Or, was there another civilization in the Abstruse Energy World, made up of another kind of light dots?</p>

  <p>Ziya was unable to solve and perfect these questions and theories, but now he could rely on Luo Nian for help.</p>
