  <p>
</p>

  <p>The war that had taken place that year had been brutal.</p>

  <p>But what hurt Lorena the most was watching the members of her race turn into blood before her very eyes.</p>

  <p>And all this was because they shared the same bloodline!</p>

  <p>At the time, she had shouted at the Yellow Emperor Guard who had unleashed the Blood Splitting Technique with all her strength and screamed questions at him, asking him why so many innocent Nine Li people had been involved.</p>

  <p>The Guard had given her a very realistic answer.</p>

  <p>"You're guilty if you have Chiyou's bloodline."</p>

  <p>She had been ignorant at the time, but she later realized that one was guilty if they were weak. Not if they had Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>In that war, almost all Nine Li people were killed.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guard, who had guarded this ship, had also paid a heavy price.</p>

  <p>Only thanks to Harper's protection had Lorena been saved.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards, who had chased after the Nine Li race, had had an absolute advantage in strength.</p>

  <p>But the remaining Nine Li people relied on the divine land and blocked the pursuit of the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>She then came to know Mike, who had been very young at the time.</p>

  <p>Mike was not from the Source World, but a divine citizen born in the divine land.</p>

  <p>She had never seen such a confident man, nor had she seen such talent.</p>

  <p>Maybe because she had seen countless people of her race turned into blood, she had a natural adoration of the strong. It was also at that time that she fell in love with Mike.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's father, Mike, knew that she was from the Sacred race and legends of the Nine Li people, he became very interested in her.</p>

  <p>Lorena continued to narrate, Zheng listening attentively.</p>

  <p>"Since you have already blocked the chase of the Yellow Emperor Guards, why are you still hiding?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race in the divine land had suffered a heavy blow.</p>

  <p>Even so, the strong masters of the Nine Li race survivors had an absolute ruling power in the divine land.</p>

  <p>There was no need for these Holy Beings to rule the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Those Yellow Emperor Guards are still alive. Harper activated the Mixed Element Seal in the divine land," Lorena said, laughing a cold laugh that sent chills down Zheng's spine. "But this battle has never stopped. It lasted until today. Your father wanted to help me and the Nine Li race. He was a man of great self-confidence. At the time, he was always in the limelight and held favor in the Hall of Holy Beings. Even Nicholas always took his side."</p>

  <p>"What? Even Nicholas?" Zheng said, a strange look crossing his face.</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, Nicholas and Murphy were his father's sworn enemies, which meant that they were also his sworn enemies.</p>

  <p>The knowledge that Nicholas and his father had been on the same side came as a bit of unexpected news to Zheng. It was almost unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lorena replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>But if he thought about it, it wasn't strange at all.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Li race had been exterminated, the only hope they could have relied on was the help of the creatures born in the divine land.</p>

  <p>These creatures had experienced countless divine eras. With the help of the resources in the divine land, they had slowly become stronger, almost replacing the Sacred race, namely the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>They obtained the Godly Tile, successfully became True Gods, and reached consummation. Through the Mountain of Holy Beings, they became Holy Beings and then entered the Time Sea, becoming a powerful force that could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"Then why did-" Zheng began, but stopped, unable to figure it out.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled wryly. "The Mixed Element Seals have sealed the Yellow Emperor Guards for many divine eras. But to them, breaking these seals only takes a little time, and we know time isn't that precious. As long as they are alive, they will eventually remove the seals. One day."</p>

  <p>"This is a hidden danger that must be eliminated," Zheng said, nodding emphatically. "So my father wanted to kill the Yellow Emperor Guards!"</p>

  <p>It made sense.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards that his mother had mentioned were here to hunt down the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>If the Guards, who were sealed at the moment, woke up, the entire divine land would suffer!</p>

  <p>As the actual leader of the Hall of Holy Beings, Nicholas had had no choice but to consider the divine land. And since Mike had made this request, he would obviously receive the support of all the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>After all, the Holy Beings regarded themselves as rulers of the divine land. How could they tolerate such a hidden danger to their beloved divine land?</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lorena. "But a lot of things happened towards the end.</p>

  <p>Nicholas betrayed us at the last minute."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Zheng asked, his curiosity rising to a new level.</p>

  <p>He knew that Nicholas had ended up killing his father and that his father was kept alive depending on the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas had had no reason to do that.</p>

  <p>Lorena looked uneasy. Zheng frowned and continued to try and get an answer from his mother.</p>

  <p>Finally, Lorena said in a low whisper, "It's because of... me..."</p>

  <p>At her words, Zheng looked at his mother's youthful appearance and was silent for a long time, the truth dawning upon him.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was a conceited man.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan was the largest group in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Before Nicholas appeared, when the Dongfang Clan had occupied the Ray Tree, there had been one Holy Being and several Demi-Holy Beings in the clan.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the Dongfang Clan hadn't managed to take the lead in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was not until Nicholas had appeared that the Dongfang Clan began to take control of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Later, after Nicholas established the Hall of Holy Beings all on his own, it joined hands with other great clans, and became even more powerful.</p>

  <p>Even when Mike had appeared out of nowhere and led the unknown Luo Clan into the Time Sea, it still didn't cause Nicholas to feel discontented or threatened.</p>

  <p>There had been arguments and conflicts of interests among these powerful clans, such as the distribution of divine might coins and disputes about each clan's territories. But there had never been any hatred between the clans.</p>

  <p>At the time, the Hall of Holy Beings had remained in harmony. After all, the Holy Beings had reached the peak of the world, and their lifespan was infinitely long.</p>

  <p>They had plenty of time to study Sanskrit words, explore the unknown chaos and various forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>As for women, the Holy Beings who were infinitely immortal could have as many as they wanted. Stunning, elegant, charming, or pure women were no matter.</p>

  <p>If he wanted, a Holy Being could have thirty thousand or three hundred thousand women, akin to an emperor's imperial harem.</p>

  <p>So it was hard to imagine two Holy Beings fighting over a woman.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had been attracted to Lorena the moment she had appeared.</p>

  <p>Especially because Lorena was unique in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never thought that his mother had been the cause of the dispute between his father and Nicholas.</p>

  <p>At the time, Nicholas hadn't spoken his mind. He had just watched coldly as Lorena and Mike became a couple.</p>

  <p>They had been about to join hands to destroy the sealed Yellow Emperor Guards when Nicholas turned on Mike and attacked him. Not only had he hurt Mike, he even opened one of the seals and released a Yellow Emperor Guard.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Lorena had gotten hurt and lost her physical body.</p>

  <p>And now, she could only use the Spiritual Darkness to replace her body.</p>

  <p>"So basically, Nicholas betrayed you and then sided with the Yellow Emperor Guards, right?" Zheng confirmed, his eyebrows knitting. "But Mother, you said that the goal of the Yellow Emperor Guards was to kill all the Nine Li people and destroy the divine land. Was this a disadvantage to Nicholas as well?"</p>

  <p>"What if the Yellow Emperor Guards gave him great benefits? He could have climbed to higher levels after sacrificing the divine land. Gone to the Source World even? He has been mad," Lorena said lightly.</p>

  <p>But there was one more important thing that she was not telling her son.</p>

  <p>Once the divine land crashed, she would not be able to hide underground.</p>

  <p>And then, Nicholas could find her without difficulty.</p>
