<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Clark's face immediately darkened upon hearing the woman's words. He turned his head and glared fiercely at her.</p>

  <p>She was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>The world of ice and snow was created by the True Demon Body. Clark might not be the strongest among the Holy Beings, but no one could parallel him in terms of controlling flames.</p>

  <p>Before she came to the ice palace, she had gathered the extra Faith Energy of all the fierce beasts in the Abyss Demon Region. The Faith Energy was then used to forge the clones. If she used it to kill Clark, it would be enough to kill him more than ten times.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Clark flew upwards several dozens of feet from the ground.</p>

  <p>With a light pat, flames of three colors were seen spreading over his head.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>The tri-colored flames instantly turned into a huge tri-colored fire cloud.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>A breath of air escaped Clark's mouth.</p>

  <p>The tri-colored fire cloud spiraled at a very high speed and rushed towards the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>Just like the woman had said, the faster the energy flowed, the more powerful it would be. He was actually applying the same theory.</p>

  <p>His tri-colored fire cloud sped swiftly and clashed against the blue light ball. As soon as his attack touched its edge, the flame within the red light ball began to roll, while the tri-colored fire cloud quickly froze and vanished.</p>

  <p>He had already gone all out with his attack. However, the result was just like that. He rolled his eyes and then came down from the sky.</p>

  <p>"This ice ball is not afraid of fire at all. It's useless!" Clark honestly stated.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, the woman remarked, "Judging from the reaction of the red light ball, we can learn that the energy it has just obtained is much more than the energy it has got from the strike of Zeke. Thus, it is useful."</p>

  <p>The woman's statement made him breathe a sigh of relief. At least, he did better than Zeke.</p>

  <p>"Now do you know why I gathered so many Holy Beings? If no one else wants to have a try, we can work together to break the light ball," the woman continued.</p>

  <p>There were still over ten clones of Holy Beings that remained on her side.</p>

  <p>Added together with the real Holy Beings, the number of the combined group was all in all about thirty.</p>

  <p>If they attacked the blue light ball at the same time, all the energy would rush to the red light ball. If the mustered energy was enough, their attack could definitely make it burst.</p>

  <p>The woman was originally considered their enemy just now, but the next moment she suggested a cooperation. Her attitude had changed completely.</p>

  <p>Some of them still held doubts upon hearing about the matter of cooperation. What if the woman played some tricks again and put everyone into disadvantageous situation?</p>

  <p>The final say should still be decided by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we can do that!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas agreed without thinking too much.</p>

  <p>The True Demon Body's ability of transforming energy had indeed aroused his interest.</p>

  <p>He heard from the woman that the True Demon Body could stop and also activate any energy. If he could have a hand on this treasure, he would almost be invincible in the divine land!</p>

  <p>"We'll do it over there. Then, you just follow my instructions and attack the blue light ball with our most powerful means," the woman instructed right after, feeling satisfied.</p>

  <p>According to her original plan, the clones of the Holy Beings were the key.</p>

  <p>At first, she did not intend to let the real Holy Beings enter the place.</p>

  <p>However, she was not sure whether the over a dozen clones she created could make that red light ball burst.</p>

  <p>In the end, she chose to cooperate. In addition, the strength and methods of the Holy Beings were indeed beyond her expectation.</p>

  <p>Naturally, she still believed that the situation was under her control!</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get ready!"</p>

  <p>As everyone prepared themselves, the woman's eyes flashed with a brown light.</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear gushed out from her body. The brown energy continuously flowed out, quickly gathering into a long spear that extended to a length of a thousand feet!</p>

  <p>Zheng at this time was feeling uncomfortable. The force of primitive fear was not directly aimed at him but the power of fear had still affected him in a way.</p>

  <p>In such case, he wasn't alone. The power had also affected the Holy Beings in the distance.</p>

  <p>They tried their best to suppress the fear in their hearts, but the expressions on their faces were more or less unnatural.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The clones of the Holy Beings took out their magic weapons and started to gather momentum at the same time. Powerful streams of internal momentum had then spread out from their bodies.</p>

  <p>When the real Holy Beings saw the magic weapons the clones had used, their faces displayed astonishment. They were completely shocked and confused at the same time.</p>

  <p>When they obtained some very powerful supreme treasures of belief, most of them would usually hide them and rarely show their power in public.</p>

  <p>Even in the alliance of powerful clans, they would not share such information. Only the closest subordinates of their own clans were made aware of it. Some supreme treasures of belief were discovered accidentally by the disciples of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands and were afterwards offered to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>As they looked at the scene in front of them, they could only stand helplessly on the side and watch these 'fake' guys take out the supreme treasures of belief which were actually the same as theirs!</p>

  <p>This woman's duplicating power was beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>Nicholas only glanced at the clones and had also started to release the dark and white Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, consummate True Gods of the alliance of powerful clans continuously activated the internal momentum in their bodies.</p>

  <p>Lights of different colors spread out in this space, and streams of momentum surged crazily.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Sword Chen were also prepared to release their own power.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>As the woman gave the order, her slender fingers flicked lightly.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The thousand-foot long spear she had suddenly flew towards the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The long spear stabbed into the blue light ball as it made the surface of the light ball surge rapidly, and the flames in the red light ball on the other side spiraled crazily. There was a faint sign showing that it had expanded and swelled.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes showed no emotion. The Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand brandished a crescent shaped sword radiance.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The sword radiance stirred and whooshed away.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Sword Chen followed with a move as he struck out streams of brown sword light.</p>

  <p>They both had cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Sword Chen had relied on the force of primitive fear while Zheng had relied on Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>The others also gathered their momentum and aimed their power at the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>Palm strikes, sword radiance, blade light, long arrows...</p>

  <p>All sorts of colors and attacks in various forms rushed to the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>The only important factor they had to pay attention to was to cut off their connection with the energy after releasing it.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the blue light ball's cold energy would be delivered back to them and worse would freeze their bodies!</p>
