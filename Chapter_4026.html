<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Treasure Bottle Platform was also a Pure Sky Platform. At the center of this Pure Sky Platform, there was a treasure bottle as tall as a person, and this was how the platform had earned its name.</p>

  <p>One of the Divine Dao extracted from the Ways-blending Energy had been sealed up in the treasure bottle. Its purpose was to make sure no complete Ways-blending Energy was ever loosed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Although the chance of completing the Ways-blending Energy was not significant, the feat was not impossible.</p>

  <p>Should someone master the complete Ways-blending Energy, it would release terrible consequences, hence, the Treasure Bottle Platform was heavily guarded, and it was virtually impossible for anyone to break in.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the secret key in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was well-protected. It was in the possession of a few Treacherous Beings who had awakened, and it hadn't been discovered for more than one thousand chaotic eras. How had it then come to the knowledge of someone now?</p>

  <p>Gianni sensed something unusual was afoot.</p>

  <p>By comparison, the world builder opposite him was insignificant...</p>

  <p>"You are lucky, but you will not be allowed to leave!" Gianni coldly said as he looked at Luo Zheng. Then he turned around and walked to the center of the Pure Sky Platform where he disappeared in the sudden flash of an orange light.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng and the others witnessed Gianni's departure.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Gianni won't let this go," said Campbell worriedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and said, "Let's leave here for now."</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone's attention was once again locked on that door.</p>

  <p>According to Campbell, the door had been replaced without anyone noticing. This door prevented anyone who entered the Pure Sky Platform from escaping it. There would be no easy escape as it was unbreakable.</p>

  <p>"Let's work together and try again. No matter what, this door is merely an object, a dead thing. I won't believe that we can't open it with our combined efforts!" Fuxi suggested.</p>

  <p>Previously, the situation had been dire, and everyone had tried to use brute force to open the door, but they had failed. Now that they had taken some time to consider it, everyone present was somewhat more optimistic.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's use this." Thurston suddenly took out a small paper bag.</p>

  <p>After opening the paper bag, a small block of hardened oil appeared, which wafted with a strange fragrance.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others didn't recognize it, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes lit up. "Is this Dragon Beast Oil? It's such a large block!"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Beast was known to be a creature that lived in the Divine River. Once it was killed, one could strip off its skin, open its stomach, and source this kind of oil there. Applying this rare oil to one's hands would greatly increase their strength.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Beast Oil was considered a rarity in the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>After all, it wouldn't trigger any attack from the Flaming Maple Forest, and it could greatly increase one's own power.</p>

  <p>This Dragon Beast Oil was therefore a treasure Thurston had cherished.</p>

  <p>However, now in order to escape, he had no choice but make use of it.</p>

  <p>Everyone stretched out their hands, and Thurston applied the oily substance to them.</p>

  <p>Even Campbell, who was in the form of a Treacherous Being, applied some of it.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng applied the oil to his hands, he felt warm. Then he felt strength flow through his hands. The oil had a magical effect.</p>

  <p>Once everyone had applied the oil, the leader of the men in black robes summoned a small golden statue with a human face and the body of a beast.</p>

  <p>There were four round balls on its back, but three of them had been crushed. The leader said, "This treasure can double everyone's strength, but it has already been used three times. There is only one more opportunity remaining."</p>

  <p>So saying, he reached out and crushed the last ball. With a crackling noise, two rays of golden light shot forth from the eyes of the golden statue.</p>

  <p>As everyone stood in the halo of the golden light, they immediately felt the strength in their bodies rapidly increase!</p>

  <p>Being able to increase the power of all the warriors within the golden light by double, the golden statue was naturally no ordinary object. However, it was a pity that it would now be useless since it was used up.</p>

  <p>In addition to these two treasures, the others also revealed their own treasures.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens in the Three Purities Stage were naturally not ordinary. For a moment, auras of all kinds of energy circulated about in front of the door.</p>

  <p>When they were in a state of readiness, everyone began to pull at the door!</p>

  <p>Facing the dragging of a terrifying force, the seemingly ordinary door began to tremble slightly.</p>

  <p>"Come on, everyone. The door can't withstand much longer." Fuxi's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>As everyone's strength rapidly multiplied, the door shook more and more violently, as if it was about to collapse.</p>

  <p>However, in the moment everyone anticipated the door's fall, a Sanskrit word suddenly appeared on the surface of it, and around the Sanskrit word there were intricate patterns that extended all the way to the edge of the door.</p>

  <p>"Does this word mean 'seal'?" the Snake Goddess mused aloud as she looked in wonder at it.</p>

  <p>The Wing King nodded. "Yes, it does."</p>

  <p>Everyone present more or less knew some Sanskrit words, and they could even decipher some of the more complicated Sanskrit words. With this Sanskrit word being very simple, they easily got the meaning at a glance.</p>

  <p>However, they only understood this word, but they were clueless as to the patterns on the door.</p>

  <p>Campbell said to Luo Zheng, "It can't be opened. This is a sealed door, and it can't be broken by brute force alone."</p>

  <p>"No matter the strength of power that is exerted on it, it can't be opened?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Campbell nodded. "Yes, no physical power can open it."</p>

  <p>Once Campbell spoke, no one relaxed at all. They had forced out almost every drop of their strength, but the door simply stabilized after the word "seal" appeared.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng conveyed Campbell's message to everyone, the Eternal Realm Hunters and the men in black robes immediately became discouraged. The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors also gave up on trying to force the door open.</p>

  <p>"It's such a pity that my Dragon Beast Oil has been wasted," Thurston said regretfully.</p>

  <p>The leader of the black robed men merely shrugged his shoulders. It was obvious his golden statue was even more precious.</p>

  <p>"What can we do now? If we can't open the door, we will be trapped here, won't we?" King Ieuan asked.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell, is there no other way to leave here?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Studying the door for a long time, Campbell suddenly said, "Our last option is to destroy this Pure Sky Platform..."</p>

  <p>"Destroy the Pure Sky Platform?" Luo Zheng repeated, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget what I can do," said Campbell confidently.</p>

  <p>Campbell's strength might be limited when it came to physical combat, but he was a world builder. All of the chaos had been constructed by him, so he understood the mysteries and principles within the chaos.</p>

  <p>Previously, the only reason why Campbell hadn't destroyed the Pure Sky Platform was because he cared for the other world builders.</p>

  <p>The other one hundred and ninety-nine builders in the Whining Road suffered the same malady as Campbell. Only once they returned here could they wake up.</p>

  <p>But now, in order to leave, he had to sacrifice those considerations.</p>

  <p>Facing the door, he swung about. Then he walked ten steps backwards, pointed at his feet and instructed, "Break open here."</p>

  <p>Following Campbell's instruction, Luo Zheng wielded the long spear and stabbed where Campbell had pointed.</p>

  <p>The ground of the Pure Sky Platform should have been impenetrable as the earlier fighting had done no damage to it.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, as Luo Zheng smashed the ground with the sharpened end of his spear, the ground cracked, revealing a rune buried within the soil.</p>

  <p>Without so much as a glance at it, Campbell took another ten steps to the side and ordered, "Smash here."</p>
