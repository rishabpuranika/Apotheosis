<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The civilization that the Dragon Lineage Human had built within the Feather Holy Sea was marvelous and had caught the eye of every single person. Everyone who was walking along the road would admire the buildings whose style was completely different from that of the human race, and in awe of their magnificent style and beauty. Several exclaims were heard every now and then.</p>

  <p>"If only I could stay here forever!" Camilla let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Stay here forever?" Renzo laughed and taunted. "So that the power of the blood sacrifice can squash you to death? What a choice!"</p>

  <p>There was a strong influence of the blood sacrifice on this place and only the Dragon Lineage Humans were able to survive inside. Rumor had it that some of the Dragon Lineage Humans were still living inside the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Unlike the procession, Zheng completely ignored these sights as he followed closely behind Randy. During this trip, he had to find life stones as many as possible. This was his main goal as he entered the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of Randy, everyone progressed and suddenly, they saw a pyramid appear in front of them.</p>

  <p>The pyramid was very unique in terms of structure. From its base to its very top, every single one of its layers had numerous narrow doors about the width and height of a person. It was densely packed with these kinds of doors and these doors were such that each door would only allow one person to pass through it. The person who had built the pyramid most probably wanted only one person to pass through each door.</p>

  <p>"Which door is the entrance?" Zheng asked curiously as he looked at the doors. He roughly estimated that there were at least ten thousand doors around the pyramid, and most probably several times more than that.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Randy shrugged his shoulders and laughed. "They are all doors, and they are all entrances!"</p>

  <p>"But they are so many. How can they all be entrances?" Camilla looked at Randy with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled and replied, "There are, in totality, 100, 000 entrances to the mine of the Dragon Lineage Human."</p>

  <p>Just as Randy was explaining the ways of the mine, they suddenly saw some blue-colored rings of light appear on the side of the pyramid following which, several warriors fell down from them.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng recognized that these warriors were the divine-level talents who had passed through the Slow Arrow Area with him. Only about half of them had chosen to stay in the Spirit Beast Area for a while, and the others had decided to walk through it as fast as they could. As a result, they were the first ones to enter the mine.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at them and saw that they were all carrying golden pickaxes.</p>

  <p>Something about the tools in their hands caught his eye. "Am I seeing things? Even their mining pickaxes are low-grade fairy weapons?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Randy let out a laugh. "Bro, you seem somewhat ignorant. The mine of the Dragon Lineage Human is completely different from the mines you know of already. Ordinary iron pickaxes cannot be used to dig out the ores in there. Only fairy weapons are strong enough to do so."</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, a normal mine was a place where soil and stones were mixed. He believed however hard those stones were, they would be soft as soil to warriors powerful enough. Why would they need fairy weapons to dig out ores?</p>

  <p>After the warriors fell, they stood up to their feet and rushed towards the gates of the pyramid once again.</p>

  <p>Seeing the puzzled expression on Zheng's face, Randy shook his head and announced, "Just bear with me everyone. You will understand everything in a while. Camilla, here! Come and take this pickax!"</p>

  <p>"What? You want me, a weak girl, to dig out ores too?" Camilla asked unwillingly.</p>

  <p>Randy naturally didn't care about her nonsense at all. He took out a pickax from his space ring and tossed it towards her.</p>

  <p>Just now, the warriors Zheng had seen were holding low-grade fairy weapons, but the pickax in the hand of Randy was even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>It was actually a top-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>When he thought about how the weapon refiners of the Harlen Divine Kingdom had actually refined such a powerful thing, Zheng could only sigh to himself, 'The gap between the warriors of the divine kingdoms and those in the Central Region is really huge.'</p>

  <p>Callan and Fiona were also distributing pickaxes to the people they had brought with them.</p>

  <p>On Zheng's side, Randy had already distributed pickaxes to Camilla, Barry and Renzo one by one. After that, only he and Zheng were left without a pickax in their hands.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng heard Randy chuckle as he took out two blue pickaxes from his space ring this time.</p>

  <p>When Zheng caught sight of these pickaxes, his eyes flashed once more.</p>

  <p>These two pickaxes could easily be ranked as low-grade sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>"Take it, Tianxing. It's easy to obtain low-grade sacred weapons in the form of saber or sword. But I've spent an enormous amount of effort obtaining these pickaxes which are low-grade sacred weapons." Randy tossed one of the pickaxes towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng caught the pickax in his hand and the strange expression on his face became even more intense as he brandished it. He was thinking about how warriors in the Central Region would often fight over a sacred weapon, but warriors in the divine kingdoms had actually made sacred weapons which were commonplace enough to be used as mining tools.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, you don't have to be too weird about this. Our four divine kingdoms originally wouldn't have wasted materials on pickaxes. But, the Feather Emperor Secret Land's mine is very special and rewarding. If we are willing to invest enough amount of money and resources on the pickaxes, we will certainly profit from it." Randy walked towards the pyramid filled with gates. Walking closer to the pyramid, he told everyone, "Let me demonstrate the process to you all. Once you enter any one of the gates, you will fall into the mine..."</p>

  <p>When he spoke, Randy had already entered through a door at the bottom of the pyramid. He then quickly vanished inside.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Randy! You haven't finished speaking!" Camilla pouted her lips as she shouted helplessly behind him.</p>

  <p>Everyone was also baffled. However, in less than thirty seconds, Randy had descended from a ring of light on the side of the pyramid, just like the other warriors from before. He then appeared in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>As he came nearer, they saw that he was carrying a fist-sized ore in his hands. He shook it and then laughed. "Hmmm. A Fire Energy Crystal.</p>

  <p>This thing isn't worth too much!" After he finished speaking, he casually threw the ore to one side.</p>

  <p>When he saw this scene, Zheng became even more curious. Previously, he hadn't used the memory of the world's will to search for the secrets of the mine. However, upon seeing a Fire Energy Crystal, he couldn't resist this impulse. However, when he searched through his mind, he discovered that there was no memory of this mine within the memory of the world's will.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows creased at the disappointing result. The world's will was a record of everything that had ever happened in this world. There were very few omissions, but this mine seemed to be one of them. He had no idea where this place had come from.</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to find any relevant information, Zheng decided to investigate on his own. Carrying the pickax in his hand, he walked towards one of the doors at the bottom of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng entered the door in front of him, he immediately found that he was falling crazily through a tunnel.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>While he was falling, Zheng turned around and saw that there seemed to be a huge plant underneath.</p>

  <p>He was not sure what plant or even what species it was, but it looked huge even from a distance. From the trunk of this plant, several slender branches extended out, and at the end of these branches were several leaves.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether he looked at the main stem or at the leaves of the plant, he saw that they were all flickering with a magnificent color. The main hue of this plant was light blue, like a layer of crystal wrapped in the outer layer, but the inner layer was a myriad of particles shining with hundreds of different shades.</p>

  <p>'Wow! What exactly is this thing?'</p>

  <p>Just as this thought appeared in Zheng's mind, he directly fell on one of the leaves.</p>

  <p>'These leaves seem to correspond with the doors of the pyramid outside.'</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head to take a look. He had entered through one of the doors in the bottom layer and had fallen on the leaf at the bottom of the plant, missing several ones above him.</p>

  <p>'The bottom of this leaf seems to contain ores! Could these ores have grown from the body of this plant?' Zheng's heart skipped a beat. He finally understood what those colorful granules were. They seemed to be ores of all kinds.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up at the giant tree and awe appeared on his face as he pondered over the plant. 'There are really so many wonders in this world.</p>

  <p>I think it isn't the plant itself that produces these ores. Instead, the plant takes the ores out from the bottom of the ground through its roots which then appear here.'</p>

  <p>The leaf under Zheng's feet contained several ores, each of a different color.</p>

  <p>He swept his gaze over them, but did not find any life stone that he wanted. However, since he had come in, he naturally had to take some of the ores with him. Therefore, he swiped the pickax in his hand at the leaf.</p>

  <p>Crack! With a crisp sound, sparks flew in all directions.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's pickax hit the blue-colored leaf, a small crack immediately appeared on it. Even a sacred weapon hadn't completely cracked the leaf!</p>

  <p>"Wow! This is so tough," Zheng exclaimed. Randy was right. Even digging the ores with a low-grade sacred weapon seemed to be a bit strenuous. It was highly probable that no pickax below the fairy-weapon grade could dig the ores out.</p>
