<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2036 Rules (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was known to be a highly intelligent individual.</p>

  <p>From the start, he knew the risks of stepping into the Sunflower Water World: he would trigger a powerful counterattack from the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Even though he was a top-rank Supreme Lord, the chances of him dying in the Sunflower Water World were quite strong, unlimited even.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't simply stand by and watch his own son's corpse being devoured by the blood-hungry wolves!</p>

  <p>With other Supreme Lords' persuasion, Supreme Lord of Original Sin hesitated.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously though, other things were happening in the Sunflower Water World, too.</p>

  <p>In the air above, several blood-red space cracks had begun to appear. The thin cracks streaked across the sky, intertwining with each other and spreading at rapid speed.</p>

  <p>Faint shadows swayed among the rays of dark red light emanating from the cracks. A great power gushed from the cracks. The Sacred Supreme Lords were hiding within them!</p>

  <p>Inevitably, this scene caused Supreme Lord of Original Sin to waken from his sullen stupor.</p>

  <p>He knew that, many times, anger wasn't the solution to the problem. If he rushed into the Sunflower Water World now, the best outcome would probably be his death at the hands of the Sacred Supreme Lords. If he died in that world, then the four great clans wouldn't be capable of operating Star Destroying Array together. This would cause a great reduction in the strength of the human race!</p>

  <p>Even worse, it could cause the whole Sacred race to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>This was definitely something he wanted to avoid.</p>

  <p>In such a situation, the possibility of humankind actually winning was so low that it could lead to the destruction of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin weighed the pros and cons and chose to be prudent.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The space crack that Supreme Lord of Original Sin had created with his Grand Teleportation technique had closed unexpectedly. The Mu Ning that had been pulsating outward had completely vanished as well, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>And that wasn't all. Once Supreme Lord of Original Sin's space crack had disappeared, the blood-red cracks that had streaked the sky above quickly followed suit and vanished too.</p>

  <p>Now that the Sacred warriors had gained the upper hand, they weren't anxious about their next move. As long as the Supreme Lords of the human race didn't take action, the Sacred Supreme Lords had no reason to act rashly either. They thus had the time to make precise, calculated decisions. And if Maha remained inside the Sunflower Water World, he would be capable of suppressing the universe's momentum with ease.</p>

  <p>This strategy could do more than just erase the malice of the entire Evolutionary Universe toward the Sacred race. It could also restrain the Heavens-suppressing Object in Master Feng's hands. From this point of view, clearly, it was the humans that had to worry.</p>

  <p>Once Maha slipped into his silver robe, he slowly walked toward Iron Moon City. Although he didn't stay in his original location or even turn around to give it a second glance, Maha was more than aware of what was going on behind him.</p>

  <p>"That Supreme Lord really has a high tolerance level!" Maha said, as he smiled faintly at Connie.</p>

  <p>Connie curled her lips which made her eyes brighten. "What a pity," she said.</p>

  <p>If Supreme Lord of Original Sin were to rush over in rage, then he would be giving Maha exactly what he wanted, exactly what he came for.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter anymore. Let's see just how much they can really endure, and whether or not they will be willing to send the Godly Geniuses over one by one." As Maha spoke, he confidently wrapped his arm around Connie's small waist and walked into Iron Moon City with her.</p>

  <p>The Silver Moon Wolves charged forward and gnawed on Nathan's corpse. This top talent of the Evolutionary Universe was devoured by the Silver Moon Wolves in the blink of an eye. The wolves had a rough sense of the Godly Way Mu Ning in the corpse, and they all let out a long howl at the sky, revealing satisfied grins of sharp teeth as they obediently returned to the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>As the human martial artists in Iron Moon City saw the bloody show, their faces warped with grief and indignation. To humans, this was destined to be great humiliation. The problem was that they couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was simply too powerful. The strongest Godly Genius of the Sacred race was actually invincible!</p>

  <p>In the face of such emotion and terror, humans could always bring out their most powerful potential and produce strong resistance. Right now, in Iron Moon City, the Demon Night warriors, the human warriors, the ogres, and the warriors of the smaller races, all remained silent. On their gloomy faces was etched a form of resilience, as if they were volcanoes just waiting to erupt at any given moment.</p>

  <p>Not too long afterward, Supreme Lord of Oracle's voice resounded throughout the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Nathan's death also had another use: to arouse the common hatred of all the living beings in the universe. Just like Maha had guessed, he didn't need to announce Nathan's death publicly. He could rest assured, for he knew that the human Supreme Lords would definitely take care of the matter for him.</p>

  <p>Prior to this, many living creatures in the universe already knew that Nathan was entering the Sunflower Water World in order to challenge Maha, and Maha seemed to be at a disadvantage. Ever since then though, the universe had maintained its silence. No one had informed them of the event's updates. The living creatures were thus all ears, just waiting to be given even the slightest news.</p>

  <p>Countless warriors had been paying attention to the matter for a long time, and yet, no one had heard anything from anyone.</p>

  <p>Until...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle's voice was suddenly heard booming throughout the entire universe.</p>
