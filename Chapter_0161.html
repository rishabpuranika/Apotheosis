  <p>Confronted with the demon, he walked steadily towards it with a three-foot cyan-blade sword in his hand. The disciples watched with bated breath as he confidently stepped into the seventh circle. To everyone's delight, he didn't slow down until he got into the eighth circle.</p>

  <p>After the demon roared at him, Henry turned back. His complexion had turned grey.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples could see that Henry hadn't succeeded in overcoming the effects of the demon's evil spirit, they took some consolation in the fact that the only indication of fear Henry showed was his grey pallor.</p>

  <p>All in all, Henry proved to be the bravest among them.</p>

  <p>As Henry left the circles drawn by Mu Ning, he put up his arms and inhaled and exhaled to calm himself. It was only after the deep breaths did his relaxed smile return.</p>

  <p>Soon, Henry scanned the faces on the disciples. He stopped when he noticed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The outer disciples noticed that Luo Luo Zheng had caught Henry's attention.</p>

  <p>During the competition against Vulture Peak, Henry should have been one of the contestants. However, at that time, Henry had been cultivating in isolation. He thus missed the chance to compete with the disciples from Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>Once Henry finished his practice, he heard of the outcome of the competition. The other disciples couldn't stop praising a particular disciple who had won the competition on behalf of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had heard of Henry's skills before.</p>

  <p>Henry, however, hadn't paid much attention to Luo Luo Zheng before. He had first heard about this prodigious disciple when Luo Luo Zheng had competed with Leo during his first few days at Drizzle Peak. Luo Luo Zheng as a newcomer then had beaten Leo who was ranked among the top 30 at Drizzle Peak. His feat had impressed many.</p>

  <p>Henry didn't think too much about Luo Luo Zheng at that time. Although Henry was aware that each peak had many geniuses, he felt secure in his ability to maintain his position as the highest ranked disciple at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Henry also remembered that when he was at Luo Zheng's age, he had been powerful enough to challenge many people in a row. Finally, through hard work, luck, and talent, Henry had risen to become an outer disciple.</p>

  <p>However, during the inter-peak competition, Luo Luo Zheng defeated several people easily, including Jesse who was ranked first at Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>This Henry had not expected.</p>

  <p>After practicing in isolation for a while, Henry had finally overcome the difficulties and stepped into the nature level.</p>

  <p>Attributable to his progress, Drizzle Peak would accept him as an inner disciple in the upcoming year. This achievement had thrilled Henry.</p>

  <p>However, after Henry stepped out of isolation, he heard rumors about Luo Luo Zheng. Some of the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak had thought that Luo Luo Zheng was powerful enough to defeat Henry even though the latter had now reached the nature level.</p>

  <p>Henry became annoyed when he heard such rumors.</p>

  <p>This was why Henry was eager to seize the opportunity to show Luo Luo Zheng who was more powerful.</p>

  <p>Many other outer disciples had noticed the hostility reflecting in Henry's eyes. And Luo Luo Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew what Henry was thinking about, but he had no interest in competing for the title of the highest ranked disciple at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>And so, he ignored Henry.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he must join the mission to kill demons.</p>

  <p>As a martial artist, there was more pressure on Luo Luo Zheng then on the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Compared with other people who desired to improve their power in the shortest time, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be more anxious.</p>

  <p>He had promised Yan to take her away from Hell Mountain, but many people would try to stop Luo Luo Zheng from doing that. So only when Luo Luo Zheng made himself powerful enough could he successfully free Yan. Otherwise, his promise would just be empty words!</p>

  <p>"Anyone else?" Aura's beautiful voice resonated through the square.</p>

  <p>The outer disciples who had tried were considered to be the bravest from among all the disciples present. However, there were still many disciples who hadn't dared to volunteer as they were either scared or lacking confidence in themselves.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was a little disappointed, and finally, she looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning knew that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't give up such a good opportunity to improve himself. Her assumption was based on the enthusiasm Luo Luo Zheng had previously shown when volunteering for tasks from Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng hadn't stepped forward yet, she was confused. Why wasn't Luo Luo Zheng trying? In fact, by asking her question, Mu Ning was reminding Luo Luo Zheng that he should have a try now.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Luo Luo Zheng walked toward the center of the square.</p>

  <p>All the disciples present at Drizzle Peak looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had won the last competition against the disciples from Vulture Peak, he had become a legend in the heart of all the outer disciples.</p>

  <p>So everyone present was eager to witness Luo Zheng's performance.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, come on!" Nory cried suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" Sean shouted as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at them, then looked at the demon in the distance, and walked toward it slowly.</p>

  <p>Although evil spirit from the demon was a kind of intent, this intent was different from other types of intent.</p>

  <p>Most times, intent could be regarded as a method to attack people.</p>

  <p>However, the purpose of the demon's intent was to raise the fear people felt.</p>

  <p>It was not advisable to assume that a demon and a beast are equally powerful and equally terrible, just because the evil spirit of the demon invoked such a response from people that made it seem as though the demon was far scarier than a beast. This was a natural ability for a demon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had tremendous power and a strong soul. Normally, the common intent could not bother him as it did to others.</p>

  <p>The demon didn't intend to hurt Luo Luo Zheng, but its evil spirit conveyed to Luo Luo Zheng that it was extremely horrible.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng walked into the first circle, he felt the evil spirit, and involuntarily, a feeling of fear appeared in Luo Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the fear wasn't overwhelming. Luo Luo Zheng smiled and relaxed. Then he walked into the second circle without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Luo Zheng had been the only person who could wear a smile in front of the demon.</p>
