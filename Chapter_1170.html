<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Normally a martial artist would be able to liquefy his life vitality at the Life and Death Realm, and the elixir field would be able to store even more of it. Once the martial artist reached the Soul Sea Realm, he would be able to open up a world, and his elixir field would be transformed into a vast ocean.</p>

  <p>When warriors reached a higher level, they could even nurture life in the vast ocean, creatures that could reproduce, become civilized, or even cultivate.</p>

  <p>In this period, the liquefied life vitality would slowly solidify, forming continents on the Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, at Zheng's current cultivation, he should still be far from solidifying his life vitality. But his life vitality began to solidify without explanation and cause.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was shocked.</p>

  <p>As knowledgeable as he was, he could not understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>As the life vitality within Zheng's body gradually solidified, its rotation speed became slower and slower. Suddenly, in this moment, a dark cloud appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>"How did this dark cloud appear out of nowhere in such a clear sky?"</p>

  <p>"It's indeed very strange. Why did the sky change so quickly?"</p>

  <p>"The dark cloud is expanding! Really fast!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was looking up at the strange scene in the sky.</p>

  <p>The black cloud that had splattered suddenly across the originally clear blue sky looked like a drop of ink dripping into a pool of clear water. The terrifying thing about it was that it was expanding at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>It had covered the entire Feather Emperor Island in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>One moment, it was daytime, and the next, dark cloud had covered the sky.</p>

  <p>It had taken half a minute for the dark cloud to cover the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>And five minutes later, it had covered the entire Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The vast lands of the four divine kingdoms were now all enveloped by darkness. Oil lamps were lit in the large towns of all the divine kingdoms. A few people belonging to the older generation even began to mutter to themselves, looking at the sky as they prayed that the gods wouldn't be angry with them.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng gazed at the dark sky, he suddenly felt an intense malicious intent. It was the evil intentions of heaven.</p>

  <p>"Is this my first small Heavenly Tribulation?" Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>He had once witnessed a small Heavenly Tribulation. A colossal phenomenon had occurred when Ning Yudie had gone through one. Back then, the scope of the phenomenon only just covered an area up to just being above the Cloud Hall. The black cloud in the sky, however, was endless. One could only imagine how powerful the upcoming Heavenly Tribulation would be.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful Mu Ning! This is the life and death tribulation Tianxing will have to face." Turner sighed and said, "This life and death tribulation is more powerful than the ones we've faced."</p>

  <p>War King Wind saw this and sighed, worried, "How can Tianxing endure this?"</p>

  <p>When warriors broke through to the Life and Death Realm, heaven would become wary of and repulse them. The warriors would have to experience Heavenly Tribulations, irrespective of whether they belonged to the Life and Death Realm, Soul Sea Realm, or a realm that was even higher.</p>

  <p>The more powerful the warrior was, the more powerful the Heavenly Tribulation would be.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Zheng's strength was far beyond that of his peers. If he was to advance to the Life and Death Realm, then the Heavenly Tribulation that he would trigger would be even more powerful!</p>

  <p>However, no one could have imagined that Zheng's Heavenly Tribulation would be this terrifying. It had already surpassed the power of the Life and Death Realm Heavenly Tribulation, and was even more terrifying than the Heavenly Tribulation many Soul Sea Realm warriors had experienced.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A ray of light suddenly flashed across the pitch-black cloud. A giant dragon formed out of lightning spiraled through the dark cloud. The moment the giant lightning dragon lit up, the Divine Kingdom Continent that had been pitch-dark, became bright as day. Everything in the world - mountains, rivers, towns, the faces of old people, the fur of little dogs - everything was bright and clear in this moment.</p>

  <p>But this beam of light only lasted for three seconds, after which the lightning dragon was once again hidden within the thick black cloud.</p>

  <p>Everything was immersed in darkness again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Another loud sound rang out. The lightning dragon streaked across the sky once again, and the light once again flickered, blindingly bright.</p>

  <p>Some mortals in the towns knelt down and prayed to the sky, hoping that the heavens would forgive them for their sins and purify their souls.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gulped, a trace of fear tinging his heart and his face as he beheld this frightening sight. He was now regretting swallowing the nectar from the pistil of the Tribulation Flower.</p>

  <p>He would be lying if he said he wasn't afraid. Even the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were secretly scared as they faced this powerful force.</p>

  <p>They were frightened even though this Heavenly Tribulation wasn't aimed at them. But since Luo Zheng was the target of this Heavenly Tribulation, it was natural for him to feel fear.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's fear only lasted for a short while before he clenched his fists, resolution taking over his features.</p>

  <p>This was a calamity that had come from the heavens.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no way of retreat. This Heavenly Tribulation was a test for him, a step that he must take in the path of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Only by taking this step could Luo Zheng qualify to be promoted to the Life and Death Realm. He would then advance towards the Soul Sea Realm, and later, step by step, towards the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"Heavens..." Luo Zheng already knew thanks to Xun's message that this was the heavens' intention. He looked up at the sky and softly said,</p>

  <p>"Come!"</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The thunder that resounded throughout the entirety of the Divine Kingdom Continent became denser and denser, like the footsteps of a massive dragon. It slowly moved above the dark cloud, taking one step at a time towards Luo Zheng, who was on the Feather Emperor Island.</p>

  <p>"Fiona! Callan! Behind me!" War King Wind called to Fiona and Callan.</p>

  <p>Turner had also told Randy and Bram to get close to him.</p>

  <p>The power of this Heavenly Tribulation was simply too terrifying. Just a sliver of it would be enough to kill all of these divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>The other divine-level talents didn't have the protection of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, so they could only retreat as far as possible.</p>

  <p>"Father, will Tianxing be okay?" Fiona asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>This wasn't an easy question to answer for the War King Wind. If it had been an ordinary divine-level talent undergoing tribulation, they would have been able to come up with some conclusion based on their own experience. Luo Zheng, however, was anything but ordinary. Even War King Wind would not have had the confidence to go through this calamity before him, which was why he was finding it difficult to give Fiona an optimistic answer.</p>

  <p>Fiona didn't prod her father further, once she had seen him choose to remain silent. Everyone knew the answer, but kept it to themselves. She understood how difficult this life and death tribulation was.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York had a cold smile on his face as he thought, 'You are indeed a peerless talent! It is a pity that you are too special. If the heavens want you to die, you will have no choice but to die. You will not be able to resist!'</p>

  <p>The other warriors at the Soul Sea Realm felt a chill steal through their hearts. Luo Zheng was probably finished now.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Another bolt of lightning pierced the dark cloud, revealing the fact that the lightning dragon had already moved above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'Is it here?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought, eyes glinting, and began to extract traces of forceful energy from his elixir field. Because his life vitality had solidified, the difficulty of extracting life vitality had increased. The solidified life vitality hardly moved, but he could do nothing but get used to it. Over time, Zheng's meridians became much thicker than those of ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>"Body-protecting life vitality."</p>

  <p>A light purple-colored barrier of life vitality enveloped Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He then began to spread out his consciousness and communicate with the stars.</p>

  <p>"Stellar Body."</p>

  <p>Two streaks of starlight suddenly pierced through the thick cloud and met each other on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"This starlight! It's the power of the stars! What kind of refinement technique is Luo Zheng cultivating?" a Soul Sea Realm warrior exclaimed, amazed. He was the one who had visualized the stars. But no matter how hard he had tried, he hadn't been able to attract the starlight no matter how real it was. He couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng had done it, how he had been able to mobilize the stars from so far away. This was simply too amazing!</p>

  <p>Looking at the starlight on Zheng's body, many of the experts at the Soul Sea Realm fell silent. They had thought that Luo Zheng had displayed his full strength at the West Dragon River. But it looked like he was still hiding a huge trump card within himself.</p>

  <p>Just how many trump cards did this kid have on him?</p>
