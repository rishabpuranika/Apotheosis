<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse was surprised that Luo Zheng didn't know of the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, who stood beside them, explained, "The Other Shore Key can be used on the Other Shore. It's necessary if you want to obtain special Other Shore Tokens. However, it's extremely rare and expensive in the Source World. Depending on its rarity, its value is usually over ten million divine crystals."</p>

  <p>"And as for the divine crystals, you can name a place and we will send them there," the Ear Mouse added.</p>

  <p>Receiving such a sizeable amount of divine crystals required powerful abilities. Those who were too weak would be killed for it. If Luo Zheng didn't have the Taiyi Heaven Palace's support, he wouldn't dare to make a deal with the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Dorothy and said, "Please send fifteen million divine crystals to the Origin Mountain."</p>

  <p>"The Origin Mountain? Are you from the Taiyi Heaven Palace?" It was not until then that the Ear Mouse found out about Luo Zheng's origin.</p>

  <p>"You can say that," replied Luo Zheng, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>"Well then, can you save me now?" the Ear Mouse asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy giggled at its request and said, "We could, but we don't trust you right now. We can't confirm your identity in the Sea of Truth. Who knows whether you're merely deceiving us? First, send the divine crystals and the Other Shore Key to the Origin Mountain safely. Then we will save you."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had notoriety across the Source World as extreme dishonesty.</p>

  <p>They were often known to give secrets away and deliberately cause rifts among other races. No matter how much trouble came in their way because of this, they still couldn't be annihilated. After all, they had their own way of survival. Because of such underhanded tactics, they grew more and more prosperous every day.</p>

  <p>Give you the divine crystals and the Other Shore Key first? I don't trust you either. Who knows if you can really break the whirlpool?" The Ear Mouse paused to think about the situation. After a while, it continued, "Well, since you can break it, you should enter the whirlpool now. The Mice League will then send the divine crystals and the Other Shore Key to the Origin Mountain shortly after. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Haha!" Luo Zheng laughed. "If I go into the whirlpool now, I'd have to break it so I could leave. You'd have all the time in the world to break the deal by then.</p>

  <p>Now I know why people call you cunning. As we just offered, send the divine crystals and the Other Shore Key to the Origin Mountain, and then I'll save you. You have no other option. If you don't want to, I'll take my leave."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng steered his Truth Boat away, looking ahead determinedly. He had only gone a few feet away when he heard the Ear Mouse crying out, "Three days! I will send the divine crystals and the Other Shore Key to the Origin Mountain in three days! I promise!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng halted his Truth Boat. Smiling faintly, he turned to Dorothy. "It seems that I have to trouble you again. The Origin Mountain..."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Fifteen million divine crystals may be astronomical for others, but we don't take it seriously. If the Ear Mouse keeps its word, I will deliver all fifteen million of them as soon as I can," Dorothy said, returning back a smile.</p>

  <p>As the deal was finalized, Luo Zheng no longer had reason to move forward in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>After leaving the sea, he saw the stars above the Dragon City, turning into long silver swords and falling. Eventually, their number got smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>The first ray of light peeked through the horizon, and suddenly, it was the next day.</p>

  <p>Every person on sight sat still and quiet, legs crossed, either meditating and comprehending the Truth of Divine Dao, or wandering in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The silver dots in the Dragon City gradually vanished within five minutes.</p>

  <p>People who were still practicing slowly woke up.</p>

  <p>"You crossed the fourth line within a night. It's no wonder you can win a flag." Monica examined Luo Zheng closely, an appreciative smile forming on her face.</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Zheng was by no means ordinary. After all, he had been paid the utmost attention. Since she had been warned, however, she was still careful not to reveal anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly at Monica. She had helped him despite taking orders from someone unknown.</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene woke up too. The silver sword light wasn't much help to Luo Zheng, but to them it was plenty. At the very least, it dispelled the Sea of Truth's chill by thirty percent. They would be able to cross the first line soon, as they had already approached it.</p>

  <p>Many Flag Masters put away their flags once everyone woke up. Some of them glanced coldly at Luo Zheng as they flew towards the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Monica prepared to follow their lead and put away her flag. She looked at Luo Zheng. "You haven't been to the Dragon City, have you? Let me show you around."</p>

  <p>"How about my men?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found it senseless that only the Flag Masters were allowed passage through the Dragon City, while others could only wander outside.</p>

  <p>She glanced at Luo Zheng's men and said, "Let them join my people."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't worried about the safety of the disciples who followed him.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the target.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng helped the disciples settle down before drawing his flag out of the ground.</p>

  <p>He then flew, following Monica towards the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The guards saw the flag in Luo Zheng's hand as they arrived at the gate. They then let them enter without any problem.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City was carved out from a giant rock and seemed massive as Luo Zheng looked at it from outside. Upon entering, however, what he saw was far from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>The city was booming and lively, with layers of voices and footsteps filling the air. Many busy Flag Masters bustled around, buying things for those who followed them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the scene in wonderment. "The Flag Masters are neither tutors nor families of people under their command. Still, why are they equally responsible for their subordinates?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unfamiliar with the rules in Dragon City despite owning a flag.</p>

  <p>"They do this for their own benefit," Monica replied, smiling at Luo Zheng's reaction. "Save for exceptions, the Taiyi Heaven Palace has determined that the only way to take part in the test of Taiyi Guards would be to become an Alliance Chief. To do so, you would need to have ten thousand followers. The Taiyi Heaven Palace also gives us monthly allowances, which help in recruiting more members."</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that with every new information, he gradually understood the Taiyi Heaven Palace's motivation.</p>

  <p>The cruelty of the Source World was far beyond his imagination. If the human race wanted to stay there forever and avoid being eliminated, they had to behave coldly towards both the inside and outside.</p>

  <p>Not far from the Dragon City gate was a huge red stone standing in the open square. Luo Zheng was in front of it, observing its features. As he did so, a Flag Master inserted his flag on one side and took out his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The aura emanating from it flowed everywhere like water. As the Flag Master faced the red stone, he activated his full strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked bewildered at the sight. As he was about to open his mouth to ask what was happening, Monica explained, "He wants to know how many Jun his force is."</p>
