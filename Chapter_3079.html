<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3079 Return From The Other Shore </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Dorothy was slightly upset.</p>

  <p>People who held a high status such as Dorothy never took the Sacred Mallow Temple seriously from the start. This was why Stage One and Stage Two of the Other Shore meant nothing to her.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens that were usually discovered in these two stages were inferior. Here at the Other Shore's beginning stage, most people would just randomly choose Other Shore Tokens and immediately challenge the higher stages.</p>

  <p>However, there were always exceptions. Some of these included the Heavenly Spider and the Heavenly Cobweb which were rarely found in Stage One or Stage Two, but could be found in Stage Three.</p>

  <p>The situation they were currently in was quite bizarre. They were surprised to discover two glazed eyeballs within the dilapidated temple. Even Dorothy failed to confirm which Stage of the Other Shore that pair belonged to.</p>

  <p>She was saddened upon knowing that she couldn't fuse with any of the glazed eyeballs.</p>

  <p>"You know, you can still take the demonic eye even if you can't fuse with it," Luo Zheng assured her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head and replied, "Giving it to me would be useless. You could sell it in exchange for soul pills. I'll fuse with the Heavenly Cobweb instead."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Cobweb was a perfect fit for the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Dorothy practiced the Origin Swordsmanship. This was divided into three key areas and one of those displayed how to master the art of stalling opponents. Fusing with the Heavenly Cobweb would enhance this key area of her practice? making it the perfect match.</p>

  <p>"I disagree," Luo Zheng interjected. "We explored the Sacred Mallow Temple together so it's only fair that we split what we've discovered equally. Even if you can't fuse with it, I insist you take it."</p>

  <p>But Dorothy wouldn't budge. Instead, she smiled and replied, "It's a pity that you've only practiced the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent other than the Truth of Cultivation Nature. If you'd cultivated another Truth of Divine Dao, you could've fused with both the eyes."</p>

  <p>"A person can own two Other Shore Tokens at the same time?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Not just two. Some of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's warriors can even possess three or four Other Shore Tokens. One more Truth of Divine Dao, one more Other Shore Token," Dorothy explained.</p>

  <p>Most of the Source World's top-level masters would often cultivate the Truths of Divine Dao according to their own needs, and they often possessed more than one Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Everyone was endowed with a Truth of Divine Dao that was most suitable for them, and the Other Shore Token that fitted the Truth of Divine Dao the most would serve as the main basis of their power and status. The remaining Other Shore Tokens served as its supplements.</p>

  <p>"I see. So that means I can fuse with another Other Shore Token as well,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded with a smile and replied, "Of course you can."</p>

  <p>"So if possessing an extra Other Shore Token enables one to have another token and force of more Jun, why is everyone in Dragon City limiting themselves to just cultivate a single Truth of Divine Dao?" a puzzled Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not everyone possesses your ability to comprehend another Truth of Divine Dao in such a short period of time." Dorothy added with a blink of her eyes, "They will be able to choose a second and third Truth of Divine Dao once they attain a higher cultivation level."</p>

  <p>These words further encouraged Luo Zheng to cultivate the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>Back in the debate venue, Luo Zheng was given the heritage of Harper along with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. But ever since then, he hadn't placed much focus into further understanding and practicing with the latter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's compatibility degree with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was not as good as that with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but it was better than that with the Truth of Cultivation Nature. It shouldn't be too difficult for him to master the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng and Dorothy were about to go down so she could fuse with the Heavenly Cobweb, he noticed a small crack on the wall.</p>

  <p>The wall was directly aligned with the two glazed eyeballs and the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed the little black eyeballs had just moved towards this direction.</p>

  <p>Could it be that their target wasn't the two glazed eyeballs but whatever was hiding behind the crack on the wall?</p>

  <p>Whatever the case, Luo Zheng knew he wouldn't be able to destroy the temple with his Soul of Light. He decided that he'd return to the temple after his body reached the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He felt that the whole thing was not as simple as what No. 9527 had told him.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Mallow Temple had been destroyed and the Dreaded Eye Demons had disappeared for so many years. Strangely enough, a few of them had suddenly revived.</p>

  <p>Once they finished putting the Heavenly Spider's body away, they returned to the first floor. Dorothy had successfully managed to activate her Truth of Divine Dao to fuse with the Heavenly Cobweb. Their first trip to the Other Shore came to an end.</p>

  <p>Upon leaving the Sacred Mallow Temple, they parted from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The sky had already lightened up and most of the people had stopped cultivating once Luo Zheng woke up.</p>

  <p>"Tam! Tam!" someone shouted. "Wake up!"</p>

  <p>One of Monica's followers remained seated in an upright position. Someone beside him called his name, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Tam Hong fell to the ground, unconscious.</p>

  <p>Monica frowned and immediately rushed to his side to check on him. After her inspection, her expression darkened. "Tam is...dead," she confirmed.</p>

  <p>"He had wandered in the ninth line of the Sea of Truth. I suspect he failed to reach the Other Shore last night."</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Tam Hong's corpse on the ground, Luo Zheng drew closer to it and shook his head. "The stormy waves of the Sea of Truth were quite unruly and many people died."</p>

  <p>Once one's Soul of Light was devoured by the Sea of Truth, a soulless body would be left behind.</p>

  <p>Those who tried to reach the Other Shore were passing through the gates of hell. Many people like Tam Hong never woke up. It wasn't a rare occurrence to see such a thing in the Dragon City or at other cultivating areas.</p>

  <p>Once Monica asked her men to take Tam Hong away, she fixed her eyes on Luo Zheng and asked, "Did you make it to the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been in the Dragon City for less than a year. He surprised many people with his cultivation progress. Now, he had successfully gone to and returned from the Other Shore? a truly amazing feat!</p>

  <p>As Monica recalled the time when she was stuck at the ninth line of the Sea of Truth, she couldn't help but sigh and wonder why she had been dealt with such an unfair fate.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I reached the Other Shore last night," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Our Flag Master has reached the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"Our Flag Master has finally become an Other Shore Realm warrior!"</p>

  <p>Faegan, Beldene, and the others also noticed the progress Luo Zheng had achieved.</p>

  <p>Although Other Shore Realm warriors weren't rare, seeing Luo Zheng become one made them all excited and proud. In their eyes, he was truly special.</p>

  <p>"Not only did you make it to the Other Shore, but your Soul of Light seems to have undergone great changes as well," Monica pointed out to Luo Zheng as she stared at him.</p>

  <p>His soul force had steadily grown over the past few months at a normal rate.</p>

  <p>Anyone who stayed on the Sea of Truth every day would have been able to grow their Souls of Light unwaveringly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Soul of Light, however, grew at an astonishing rate this time that made even Monica question her own power and think that he had surpassed her.</p>

  <p>'He has just entered the Other Shore. How did he make it?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"Good luck was on my side," Luo Zheng replied in an indifferent tone as if talking about the weather. "I found something useful in Stage One."</p>

  <p>"Something useful?" Monica let his words hang on her tongue. What useful thing had provided Luo Zheng the chance to grow his Soul of Light at such a rate?</p>

  <p>That could only mean one thing? he had discovered the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>But why would such a precious crystal appear in Stage One of the Other Shore? And even if it did appear, the soul crystal wouldn't have had much energy. Monica continued to ponder over this.</p>
