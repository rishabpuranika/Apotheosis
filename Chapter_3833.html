<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3833 Migration </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fox girl was on the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Her figure was still proportioned perfectly, even when outlined by the black ink.</p>

  <p>She was surrounded by black savage beasts, but they weren't hostile, they scurried around her like her pets.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A gust of cold wind blew from afar, dissipating some of the ink on the scroll painting rather quickly.</p>

  <p>"Master brush-wielder, is he there?" asked the fox girl somewhat desperately as she looked up.</p>

  <p>From where she stood, she couldn't see Zheng's exact route.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder appeared above. He was able to see everything from page one to three.</p>

  <p>"He's in," answered the crying face.</p>

  <p>The fox girl breathed a huge sigh of relief but there was still a hint of worry visible on her face, "I do hope he succeeds..."</p>

  <p>Being so patient in waiting for this one chance was no mean feat. Zheng could not fail. Fear overcame her as she waited hopefully. If he did manage to succeed, her race's curse would probably be broken.</p>

  <p>But one chance was all there was. She had no choice but to pray vehemently in silence.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in Stage Thirty-three, in a huge metal mountain, a white ball slowly rose up.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in it, not even any of the five elements.</p>

  <p>The white ball floated above the metal and began rattling chaotically on the inside. A thin crack surfaced in the center, when it suddenly opened, a black eye appeared out of it.</p>

  <p>This was the strongest warrior of the Element Spirit race, Eye Spirit, who had been the number one warrior on the Eternal Scroll Painting for countless years.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The big black eye opened and a red light glowed in front of it, a slender woman appearing from within it. "Chief, why have you summoned me?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"Claire, I've told you hundreds of times not to come before me in this human figure," reprimanded the Eye Spirit sternly.</p>

  <p>She didn't seem to take it seriously and said, "I feel free in this form. I like it."</p>

  <p>She didn't seem afraid of the Eye Spirit despite being a subordinate. She did, after all, hold the right to make many decisions.</p>

  <p>"I have prepared a body for you as well. Would you like to try it?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the side and the flames flickering on her fingertips created a human with a well-proportioned and in-shape body. In fact, it looked very much like Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't make such horrible jokes." The eye flashed a white light which shattered the human body.</p>

  <p>Claire wasn't offended or at all bothered. She simply recreated it and put her arm around the man's neck, smiling playfully. "I know what you're thinking.</p>

  <p>Zheng has indeed already surpassed you in the Eternal Scroll Painting!"</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit's annoyance was clear in the eye. "I'm sure it was designed by him."</p>

  <p>"Exactly right," Claire replied with disdain all over face. "Chief, you are suspicious and cunning, but your character has held you back. I've known it since the beginning."</p>

  <p>"Is this why you let him in?" His dissatisfaction could be felt clearly.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had faced several big and dangerous challenges on the Other Shore. This threat came from a mere human but the Eye Spirit still regarded it as the greatest of them all.</p>

  <p>Claire stretched a finger out and drew circles on the look-alike Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"Since we can't stop him, all we can do is make the best of the situation. We still have a great chance of winning him over."</p>

  <p>"How do you plan to accomplish that?" asked the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>She moved her palm up from fake Zheng's face and opened his eyes. "Getting the origin-level bloodline is not easy, it cannot be obtained quickly. If he stays in that place for a while, his physical body may not be difficult to get.</p>

  <p>If I get his body, he will submit to me, yes?" Claire turned her head to look at 'Zheng'. It was her little puppet that she could make do exactly as she wanted. She made it nod stiffly and reply, "Yes."</p>

  <p>Her strategy satisfied the Eye Spirit. "If that's the case, you have to make a move as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Chief. I'm fully prepared. There will be an attack on the Oneness Sky Palace again and this time we will kill them all," she promised with a sweet smile, while the look-alike Zheng beside her grinned as well.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit's big eye blinked, and before he closed it he added, "By the way, you should show me more respect next time."</p>

  <p>He finished speaking and completely disappeared into a white ball, slowly descending from the top of the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>"I will be the one to be respected," Claire muttered menacingly.</p>

  <p>She looked at 'Zheng', very satisfied with this body. She kissed it gently and their two bodies turned into flames and disappeared within the sphere.</p>

  <p>Pearce saw the Eternal Scroll Painting close and fell into a daze for moment. 'Something is wrong, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Pearce?" asked Auden.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of the Other Shore first!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Pearce finished speaking, he left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all the Souls of Light around him, including Auden, Athemar and Libby, hastily chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune and returned to the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A golden light rose from the Phoenix Palace and exploded above, forming a snow-white circle of light. This was Pearce's summoning order.</p>

  <p>The masters of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace saw the circle of light and began whispering words of worry in their hearts. The Oneness Sky Palace had just stabilized a few days ago and now something major was already happening? The color drained from all their faces as they made their way to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Soon all the masters were gathered in the hall, including the representatives of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>"All the members of the Oneness Sky Palace are expected to migrate to the Pear Hill," announced Pearce.</p>

  <p>The hall erupted into an uproar.</p>

  <p>Pearce had wanted to move the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill when they had been invaded by the Sun Crow race. In this way, they could save their lives and energy before Eastern Emperor Taiyi awoke. However, Ziya and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had later given the Oneness Sky Palace the strength to put up a fight.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng was trapped in the Eternal Scroll Painting, whether he was safe or not, he could not protect the Oneness Sky Palace. This was why Pearce had announced the migration.</p>

  <p>"You must give me reason!" A master from the Bright Mountain demanded.</p>

  <p>He had been in charge of the Bright Mountain since the death of their leader.</p>

  <p>"I will not give you a reason. It's simple. If you want to die, stay. You have one day to mobilize your people," Pearce replied briefly.</p>

  <p>The implication was clear. The Oneness Sky Palace was about to suffer a catastrophe. If they didn't move, they would die.</p>

  <p>The masters of the mountains understood. Pearce's attitude indicated that they indeed had no choice.</p>
