<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 437 Flood Dragon Bone Spear (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>More than a hundred dragon scales were activated simultaneously, generating even more power for Luo Zheng's body like flood peaking between canyons. The energy that flowed through his body was so intense that his shoulders became swollen, and his blood vessels were distended as if dragons were flying on the surface of his skin.</p>

  <p>As they were about to collide, Jacques laughed and then roared, "I will smash you to pieces!"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng managed to avoid the sharp horns of Jacques' white bone armor and directly hit him on the shoulder!</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>With the strength of the two opposing forces, their collision created a loud thudding sound that echoed.</p>

  <p>To the surprise of everyone who witnessed the violent impact, Jacques, in his white bone armor, was knocked down and then thrown from one edge of the fighting ground to another. And finally, he slammed into the light curtain of enchanted barrier!</p>

  <p>In the past, some disciples also crashed into the same barrier with the force of a single punch.</p>

  <p>Designed to protect disciples from collisions that usually took place during such contests, the light curtain of enchanted barrier was very soft.</p>

  <p>Its primary function was to separate disciples from viewers during competitions, so it was not built to withstand powerful collisions. But Luo Luo Zheng summoned all the explosive forces from the dragon scales as he slammed into Jacques.</p>

  <p>If Jacques, in his white bone armor, was referred to as a war chariot, Luo Luo Zheng was then regarded as a ferocious beast.</p>

  <p>Such powerful and pure force was unleashed on Jacques, causing him to hurtle backward. This collision force exceeded the limit the enchanted barrier could bear. Spectators could only see from outside the barrier when the light curtain shook a few times and were aghast when they noticed cracks in the structure like those in a broken mirror before it finally burst into pieces.</p>

  <p>While it helped absorb some of the collision force on Jacques, it could not prevent him from flying out into the field. Without any sign of slowing down, he was thrown into the crowd, crashing into any object along his path.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Jacques, he was headed towards the area where Skytop Peak disciples were. They saw what happened to him, so, Tianming, Sheeny, and even Wing, who was still in recovery, immediately stretched out their hands to catch the flying disciple. It was the only way to halt the oncoming Jacques and help him to get up.</p>

  <p>Once Jacques was finally upright, the disciples from other peaks felt relieved and relaxed a bit. But they were still somewhat fearful that it could happen again.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate there were several powerful disciples from Skytop Peak.</p>

  <p>There might not have been fighters strong enough to hold him back if Jacques hurtled towards the direction of either Drizzle Peak or Vulture Peak. And that would have resulted in many being injured or worse, killed.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng had displayed innate superhuman strength since the very beginning, he had never discharged all his ultimate power before that collision.</p>

  <p>So, at this point, everybody was still shocked by the energy he had thrown at Jacques, nor could they understand what took place.</p>

  <p>Not everyone was fortunate to have innate superhuman strength, which made them extraordinarily powerful. For martial artists, being born with superhuman strength might give them an edge, especially during fights, but people usually did not take this advantage seriously.</p>

  <p>Strength was a fundamental component in battle. A fighter with innate superhuman strength would have a distinct advantage during competitions. However, the body's physical strength was limited, unlike one's life vitality, which had the potential to grow. The strength derived from life vitality was usually dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times greater than the normal body's strength.</p>

  <p>In that case, no matter how great the power derived from human body was, it was still not enough to knock down Saint Viana with a single punch from a long distance, much like what Kenneth did.</p>

  <p>And this was the reason why martial artists were all focused on refining the life vitality and paid little attention to pure body refinement. They did not think that body refinement did much to enhance their refining life.</p>

  <p>With little opportunity for progress in pure body refinement, why even give it importance or attention?</p>

  <p>So how was Luo Luo Zheng able to do what he just did? Everyone who witnessed this was astonished.</p>

  <p>How could he overthrow Jacques who wore white bone armor? He didn't even have any protective gear and only used his body to make the collision. So, how did he manage that? Did their minds play tricks on them just now? Was it an illusion that they saw?</p>

  <p>They all looked at one another, only to find similar confused expressions in everyone's face. If only one person witnessed it, the scene might have passed as an illusion. But many saw it at the same time, so it had to be real.</p>

  <p>If that was what precisely happened, then what came to mind was the enormous power Luo Luo Zheng had showed just now, and everyone was suddenly terrified. The talented disciple had done exceptionally well to the astonishment of the entire Cloud Sect in this All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>While most of those present were confused and scared, Jacques, who was one of the heroes in the scene, had even more mixed feelings. He finally stood up with the help of his companions. Before colliding with Luo Luo Zheng, he had been very excited, expecting to see this arrogant young fighter get smashed to pieces before his eyes. But as they crashed into one another, the excitement was replaced by confusion. No one knew better the power Luo Luo Zheng used to fight than Jacques. Being hurled out of the battlefield, he was no longer confused but fearful. Now, there was only a look of helplessness on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew in his mind that Luo Luo Zheng was a tough fighter. Prior to their meeting, Jacques also considered himself fierce with sufficient strength to defeat his opponents. To his surprise, Luo Luo Zheng was more ruthless and tougher than himself. Confident in the capacity of his white bone armor, Jacques threatened to crush Luo Luo Zheng to pieces. But Luo Luo Zheng, without a hint of fear, didn't even dodge his attack but instead met him head-on with hard crushing power to overwhelm him and then finally had the upper hand.</p>
