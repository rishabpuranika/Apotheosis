<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It took Zheng an entire day to get a general feel of the Sand Core City.</p>

  <p>The Sand Core City was the only large city within a two-hundred-thousand-mile radius of where Zheng had been. The force that controlled the city was the Mysterious Soul Sect, which was located in the Night Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Soul Sect was one of the largest sects for the ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>The auction house in the Sand Core City was personally hosted by the steward of the Mysterious Soul Sect. The major business groups gave the treasures they had acquired to the auction house for selling.</p>

  <p>But the auction was held only once a month, and there were three days left until the next one.</p>

  <p>So Zheng had to stay in Sand Core City and wait for the auction.</p>

  <p>Only after having arrived at the Sand Core City did Zheng realize that the value of the wild bones was not as high as he had previously thought.</p>

  <p>Everyone here cultivated the Wild God system, and they used a great deal of the wild bones as they were the currency they used to trade.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that Riley of the Falcon Caravan was so restless in the Iron Tribe. As an ordinary steward of the Falcon Caravan, he got several pieces of wild bones per month as his salary. According to the order of the Falcon Caravan, he collected the wild bones. If he had only managed to collect a small number of wild bones, it was not worth him to come here.</p>

  <p>The part of the Immemorial Wilderness where the Iron Tribe lived had been excavated so many times that it had become an exhausted mine.</p>

  <p>The members of the tribe could only make a living by picking up any leftovers they were lucky to find.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had managed to collect what he had initially thought was a sizeable amount, all he had done was gather the leftovers. In this world, that was worth nothing. The situation was not completely bleak, however. He had been lucky enough to obtain the wild bone with the blood of the Spirit Wolf God.</p>

  <p>"Now I understand how some people can grow their bodies to be thousands of miles tall. With enough wild bones, the Wild Gods can grow infinitely."</p>

  <p>However, it was not easy to collect so many wild bones.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people living in the Sand Core City got just one or two pieces of wild bone per month as their salaries. In a year, they could collect a total of twenty four wild bones at most.</p>

  <p>Only by joining those great powers could they obtain more wild bones.</p>

  <p>At this thought, a plan formed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Three days passed, and Zheng took the bone card of the Falcon Caravan to the auction house.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng made sure to take precautions this time. He would not let carelessness thwart his plan. Before leaving, he changed his appearance using the disguise technique. He could not let the members of the Falcon Caravan recognize who he was.</p>

  <p>Many people had been gathered in the auction house, and they all had the bone cards of major caravans which acted as qualifications for the auction.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been waiting in the auction house for a while when someone finally came out to meet him. It was a woman.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any bone card of a caravan?" The woman's expression was cold and unwelcoming. Her complexion was pale, almost ashen, and her lips bloodless.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and took out the bone card of the Falcon Caravan to show her.</p>

  <p>The woman did not seem impressed by it in the slightest. "The bone card of the Falcon Caravan?" she scoffed, one side of her lip curling into a disgusted sneer. "Where did you find that? Someone probably just gave it to you for free... The auction house is not interested in rubbish. Don't waste my time."</p>

  <p>She was obviously not the type to make exceptions. She stood at the entrance, refusing to let Zheng in, observing him with the disgust one might regard a piece of dirt on their shoes.</p>

  <p>Her reaction was not unprecedented. As a caravan at the bottom of the society in the Sand Core City, the Falcon Caravan had a bad reputation.</p>

  <p>However, it was established very early in history and had occupied almost all the low markets around the city, so the auction house had no choice but to cooperate with it.</p>

  <p>Zheng was, thus, not irritated by her words. His expression remained calm.</p>

  <p>"How can you know the thing I am offering is rubbish? You don't even know what it is," he said softly.</p>

  <p>The woman's expression shifted slightly. She seemed impressed, in spite of herself, by Zheng's confidence and nerve. She smiled faintly. "Follow me then," she said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed her as she led the way.</p>

  <p>Having passed the hall of the auction house, they walked about 100 feet along the wide corridor and entered a cubicle.</p>

  <p>There were three middle-aged people sitting in the cubicle. As the treasure identification masters of the auction house, they were responsible for identifying all kinds of treasures to determine whether they were qualified to be sold in the auction house. They were also the ones to set the prices.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," the woman said as she led Zheng in, waving her hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng strode into the cubicle, the eyes of the masters following him closely.</p>

  <p>The three of them had identified and priced countless treasures, but they also knew how to judge people. When they noticed Zheng's cultivation level, they were all surprised.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's interesting. You seem to have just begun to cultivate the Wild God system, but you have been a True God for a while now. Is that right?" one of the middle-aged men said curiously.</p>

  <p>"It's really rare to see," said another master.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and said, "In the end, there are many paths one can take to reach the same goal. As long as I keep getting stronger, what difference does it make which system I use, the Wild God one or the True God one?</p>

  <p>I can cultivate either."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the three middle-aged men seemed rather taken aback.</p>

  <p>Zheng's perspective was very new to them.</p>

  <p>Warriors who chose to cultivate the True God system were commonly regarded as divergent, rebellious even.</p>

  <p>The reason was the quest to become a True God was a completely solitary one. They had to depend completely on themselves. The process to become a Wild God, however, could be made significantly easier and shorter if one managed to amass a large number of wild bones.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, it was much more difficult to become True Gods in this world. There were no such shortcuts.</p>

  <p>One of the three auction masters laughed. "Impressive," he said, narrowing his eyes as he observed Zheng. "I have heard that consummate True Gods are extremely powerful. So far, however, no one has succeeded, in spite of all that power... If you succeed, you will become the very first one in all history to do so, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng understood that this was a backhanded compliment. The master intended to make a fool of him.</p>

  <p>Zheng maintained his composure, however, and said nothing, smiling politely.</p>

  <p>"Please show us what you want to auction," the woman urged, waving her hand impatiently.</p>

  <p>The auction house of the Sand Core City held one single auction every month, so the house was always crowded. This woman had to take every one of the sellers into the auction house, so she was eager to move things along, not wanting to waste precious time on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want to sell?" one of the masters asked.</p>

  <p>"I want to sell a blood wild bone," said Zheng with a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"A blood wild bone?" The master who had answered looked incredulous.</p>

  <p>"The hierarchy of the blood wild bones is very complicated. The value is different for every rank. As you might already know, the blood of some wild bones is poor and ordinary people can't extract the Wild God Power from them. Such wild bones are less valuable than the ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>And even if the blood of the wild bones is good, we still have to judge their size, quantity and so on."</p>

  <p>All this time, the fair-skinned woman continued to stare at Zheng with relative indifference. She had been impressed by Zheng's determination, but she knew that Zheng's cultivation level was too low and that he held the bone card of the lowly Falcon Caravan. It was most likely that the wild bone he had was of poor blood, just as the master had said. Yet, he still wanted to sell it as a treasure at the auction house. He would make a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and raised his hand gently. A ray of blood red light shot out from his space ring.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a violent aura spread through the cubicle.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p id="top_13">A blood colored wild bone, tall as a man, smashed on the ground, and the cubicle shook.</p>

  <p>The three masters and the fair-skinned woman all stared at the wild bone, their mouths open in surprise.</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of blood colored blood wild bones. They couldn't yet tell what blood Zheng's wild bone belonged to, but the violent aura radiating from within it was undoubtedly a sign of extraordinary power.</p>
