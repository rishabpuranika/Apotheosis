</p>

  <p>"We must get out of here!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Let's dig a tunnel to the ground!"</p>

  <p>These warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm all scrambled to run. While they might not be able to fight against the grand sorcerers, they could still escape.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, such a path might even be more dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Let me lead the way!" Preston said.</p>

  <p>His primary mission was to protect Ning Yudie, but as an elder of the sacred place, he believed it was his obligation to take the lead at the moment.</p>

  <p>He summoned some life vitality and turned it into a spiral which spun quickly, and then dashed toward a corner of the underground palace. His Space Law power shattered the palace walls with a loud crash, and a hole about the size of a man appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," ordered Preston as he led the group and dashed into the hole.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie glanced at Preston's bleeding shoulders with gritted teeth, and then followed suit.</p>

  <p>She had been rained with bad luck ever since she had ascended into the Upper World. Thus, she had no choice but to follow Preston at the moment and see what would be out there for her.</p>

  <p>Preston himself tried hard to endure the biting of the skulls on his back as he dug his way forward, with Ning Yudie and the other core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place close behind him.</p>

  <p>After a long time of digging forward, Preston dug upward and finally reached the ground. His eyes first scanned the surroundings, and then he dashed toward a specific direction.</p>

  <p>"Let's head for the supreme world channel!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But where should we go through the supreme world channel?" someone asked. When Preston heard the question, he abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>To be honest, he hadn't thought about that. It seemed that there was no safe escape. The sorcerer race might have invaded the nearby Cyan Lotus Sacred Place as well. Where else could they run to?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, black lightning bolts continued to flash in the sky. 'Is the sorcerer race going to occupy the entire Pure Jade Sacred Place?' he wondered. However, that was almost impossible. The ancient sorcerer race wasn't strong enough to occupy the place forever. They weren't powerful enough to fight the Supreme Lords, and the Humanity Alliance had more than ten thousand world lords. If they joined forces, the sorcerer race wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Once the Supreme Lords came, the sorcerer race would have no choice but to escape. They wouldn't have a chance against the combined forces of all the other races in the universe.</p>

  <p>The only reason why the humans were in an unfortunate situation was because the sorcerer race's sudden attack caught them off guard.</p>

  <p>Still, now wasn't the time to think about such things. They still had to keep going before the reinforcements would arrive.</p>

  <p>"There's still one place that we can escape to," Ning Yudie suddenly said as she followed closely behind Preston.</p>

  <p>But Preston only glanced at her briefly. He didn't expect her to give him any good suggestions anyway. He thought that Ning Yudie only happened to be Zheng's wife, but she had just ascended to the Upper World so she knew little about the things in this place. How could she even give him any good options?</p>

  <p>Then again, Ning Yudie didn't mind his indifference and continued, "The Lower World. We can go to the Lower World."</p>

  <p>"That's right! Now that the universe is in chaos, the Lower World is probably the only safe place to go!"</p>

  <p>"We can go there through the ascending passageway!"</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a good suggestion!"</p>

  <p>Except for Ning Yudie, the other warriors were all from the Upper World who subconsciously looked down on the Lower World. Thus, they never really thought about escaping there even when they were already in such a big crisis.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ning Yudie had come from the Lower World, which was why she thought of such a plan.</p>

  <p>"But... If we return to the Lower World, I'm afraid that the great world will reject us," added Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. This isn't a problem for us," Preston nodded and said,</p>

  <p>"This is a feasible plan. Follow me!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult for warriors of the Upper World to avoid the repelling power of a great world. After all, there were some items they could use to descend to the Lower World.</p>

  <p>After they'd made their decision, Preston quickly led the group to the supreme world channel and rushed towards the Ascending Wells in the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>In the territory of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle was the first one who left. Most of the Roaring Tokens that called for help were from the world lords of the Humanity Alliance, which meant that they were the ones who encountered the most enemies. As the leader of the Humanity Alliance, she had to hurry back in the soonest possible time.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords also followed suit, and left one by one.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, only the nine Godly Geniuses and Master Feng remained in the cave. Karl's body had already been taken away, and no one knew if he could be revived.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that the sorcerer race would be so rampant. They started the days of chaos," Nathan said with a frown. He had heard the cries for help from the regions of the Thoughtless Minds, and some of the supreme worlds under attack were governed by his clan.</p>

  <p>Lawson snorted coldly and said, "Our patriarchs will soon deal with them. The sorcerer race is no match for the Supreme Lords. Even their grand sorcerers are only at the world lord's level."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Luo Zheng?" Mu Ning asked out of the blue. She was concerned when she saw the expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were filled with worry and he couldn't mask his true feelings.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he was worried about Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>With the help of the memories of the great world, he knew that Ning Yudie wasn't in the Lower World anymore. Thus, it could only mean that she had also ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But where was she now?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that Yudie's cultivation base made it hard for her to obtain a Roaring Token. He was worried for her safety, especially now that the war broke out.</p>

  <p>"Alright, now is the time to decide your arrangements," Master Feng said.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses had to grow quickly. They had outstanding talents and powerful strengths, but they could still risk getting killed by the sorcerer race and the "intruders." Fortunately, after their blood had been exchanged, they could at least avoid the attacks of the "intruders" now.</p>

  <p>"Where will we go?" Lone asked curiously. He originally thought that they would remain in the Celestial Position race's territory.</p>

  <p>But before Master Feng could announce his arrangements, Luo Zheng had already brought out his Roaring Token, and his voice reverberated throughout the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"Ning Yudie! Where are you?"</p>

  <p>He felt his heart sink with regret. He should have looked for her earlier.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had ascended to the Upper World, the entire universe had been quite peaceful. No one could've imagined that the world would be suddenly plunged into chaos when the Illusion Battlefield had closed.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng knew that it was almost impossible to receive a response from Ning Yudie, but he didn't know how else to contact her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie had actually heard Zheng's call.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Preston led Ning Yudie through the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>He and the other warriors from the Pure Jade Sacred Place also heard Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng!" Ning Yudie exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>Even amidst the danger, she was naturally excited to hear her husband's voice.</p>

  <p>"But we can't respond to him. Let's continue on our way," Preston said.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but sigh deeply. They had no way to communicate with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If they had known earlier that such a thing would happen, the Saint Lord would have given Ning Yudie a Roaring Token. While Roaring Tokens were rare and precious, they could help them bring reinforcements faster.</p>

  <p>The Humanity Alliance had only sent Supreme Lord of Oracle to the Celestial Position race, while the other Supreme Lords such as Supreme Lord Healum and Supreme Lord Illusion had remained in the Alliance.</p>

  <p>However, the sorcerer race had an advantage when they simultaneously attacked many places. Thus, the reinforcements for the Pure Jade Sacred Place might be delayed.</p>

  <p>The situation left them no other choice but to follow their plan and try to descend to the Lower World.</p>
