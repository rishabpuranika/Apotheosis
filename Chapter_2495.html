  <p>
</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Zheng appeared in the great hall with Yan, deflating all the hope that Troy, Rachelle and the others had had.</p>

  <p>They glared at Zheng as if they wanted to swallow him up.</p>

  <p>A faint smile hung on Zheng's face as he responded to Rachelle's gaze.</p>

  <p>"You're disappointed, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>A murderous look appeared on Rachelle's face. Unfortunately, the debate venue had returned to normal, so her murderous intent was once again suppressed by the Truth of Goodwill.</p>

  <p>"You've gotten the inheritance of the debate venue?" Troy asked while staring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary for me to answer your question?" Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>Although he was just a low-rank True God, everything from the way he spoke to the way he behaved made it seem like he was on the same level as the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Troy couldn't help but take offense, but he took a deep breath, relaxing his expression before calmly replying with a question of his own. "Do you think that you've already won?"</p>

  <p>"At least we've won the first step." Yan, who was standing beside her brother, raised her little face high, her eyes flashing with a sharp luster.</p>

  <p>Troy smiled coldly and turned to look at Harold. "Let's hope that you're still this lucky next time." Then, turning to his allies, he said, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Under his lead, Rachelle, Walton, all the consummate True Gods, and the top-rank True Gods from the alliance walked out of the hall.</p>

  <p>When Troy reached the gate, Marsh suddenly called after him. "Say hello to Nicholas for me! Please forgive us for our poor reception!"</p>

  <p>Troy turned to Marsh and nodded. "No problem, I will report it to him.</p>

  <p>Thanks for your 'meticulous' treatment." Then he left the hall in a huff.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Time Sea from the Heavenly Sword Divine City was very convenient. One only needed to pass through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>After the group of people in the alliance of the wealthy clans left, Marsh looked at the main entrance of the hall and said with a faint smile,</p>

  <p>"Nicholas is going to explode with anger this time."</p>

  <p>Harold nodded. "Nicholas is not one to back down. I'm afraid that the Dongfang Clan will try to take revenge on the Sword Clan."</p>

  <p>As the second ranked powerful clan in the divine land, the Sword Clan had been on good terms with the Dongfang Clan for many years and had never interfered with each other's business.</p>

  <p>But this time, by supporting and protecting the Luo Clan, the Sword Clan had clearly taken a stand against the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"Humph, if it weren't for Nicholas's crazy plan, our Sword Clan would never have provoked him. He wants to destroy the divine land? Humph!</p>

  <p>He should ask all the people in the divine land what they think," Gibson said coldly.</p>

  <p>These Holy Beings of the divine land knew more or less about the dispute between the Luo Clan and the alliance of the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Before, most of the wealthy clans had been indifferent to it.</p>

  <p>After all, no one had been willing to offend the Dongfang Clan for the sake of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>However, they had never expected that the dispute between the two could actually affect the fate of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had only recently found out from Harold how mad and unreasonable Nicholas had become.</p>

  <p>He was actually ready to destroy the entire divine land just for his own ambitions.</p>

  <p>Since it was a matter of life and death for the entire divine land, the Sword Clan, as the second ranked powerful clan in the divine land, had no choice but to take a stand and solve the problem.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, we should be careful. Nicholas is an unpredictable man." A worried expression appeared on Marsh's face.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had messed with the Dongfang Clan, which meant that they had messed with all the clans in the alliance.</p>

  <p>And according to what Harold had said, there was a powerful man who was at the Other Shore Realm behind Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Master Marsh. No matter what, I don't think the Dongfang Clan will have the advantage," said Harold lightly. "The Moon Clan has already said they won't stand on the side of the Dongfang Clan. And if they learn about Nicholas's ambitions, they will probably make the same decision that you did."</p>

  <p>The path that Nicholas had chosen was equivalent to standing against the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan had the same resources as the Sword Clan and it was the third ranked wealthy clan. The Moon Sect, the War God Hall, and the Mysterious Soul Building each had a Holy Being in charge, so the Moon Clan was also a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>At present, Harold's goal was very clear.</p>

  <p>He was trying his best to rope in more powerful forces in the divine land to stand on his side so that he wouldn't find himself in a one-on-one fight.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see." Marsh nodded.</p>

  <p>People at the same level as them could see through the nature of things in a short time.</p>

  <p>Since they couldn't predict Nicholas's next move now, they would just have to wait quietly and be prepared for anything that came their way.</p>

  <p>"Our next step will be up to Zheng," said Harold, staring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Entering the sun?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Right." Harold nodded.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the Sun-resisting Umbrella, Zheng had become the new captain of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"When?" With a gleam in his eyes, Harold replied, "At dusk tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"So soon?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>A trace of a helpless smile appeared on Harold's face as he shook his head. "Actually, it is already very late. The speed at which the divine land is falling keeps increasing. At this rate, we'll reach a point where it will be too difficult to save the divine land even if we manage to change the direction."</p>

  <p>If a huge object fell down, it would take a lot of time and effort to lift it back up.</p>

  <p>And the divine land was like a ship that was unimaginably large. They were indeed running out of time.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He had learned a lot of things from his mother, so he had no doubts about Harold's arrangement.</p>

  <p>Troy and the others returned to the Sword Clan's Floating Island through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>All of them had sour expressions on their faces and kept silent.</p>

  <p>They had suffered a crushing defeat this time.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Sword Clan's Floating Island, Troy traveled through thick clouds and returned to the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, which was the first-ranked Floating Island on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"Look! It's Master Troy!"</p>

  <p>"Master Troy!"</p>

  <p>"Troy, you're back!"</p>

  <p>When Troy entered the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, all the members of the Dongfang Clan bowed respectfully to him.</p>

  <p>But Troy just walked past them without saying a word. He was heading toward the East Hall on the Floating Island with a gloomy expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"Why hasn't Duke come back with him? They went to the Non-combat Zone together, right?"</p>

  <p>"Did they fail?"</p>

  <p>"So what if they failed? When have they ever succeeded in recent years?</p>

  <p>Why is he so upset?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Dongfang Clan didn't know any details, but they knew that something was wrong from the look on Troy's face.</p>

  <p>When Troy reached the entrance of the East Hall, he stopped and closed his eyes, revealing a trace of exhaustion on his face. It wasn't until minutes later that he entered.</p>
