  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stepped onto the accelerating rune as she spoke.</p>

  <p>The huge stone she was on, which had been floating calmly, turned to a beam of light and quickly shot at Zheng. It sped up so suddenly that two people were thrown off Feng Ge's stone.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The people of the Origin Mountain and the Ivory Mountain were in a heated battle, but even they could not resist the spectacle unfolding here.</p>

  <p>"What a fast speed!" Jermain murmured unconsciously.</p>

  <p>"The stone flies so fast. Is it weightless?" Dorothy's jaw dropped as she watched.</p>

  <p>Whitlock's face was filled with fear as he watched the giant stone streak across the sky.</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge found Zheng was a strong and worthy opponent, nothing else mattered to her, not the first place, not the fight between the Origin Mountain and the Ivory Mountain, nothing. Only her battle with Zheng meant something.</p>

  <p>Seeing Feng Ge rushing towards him, Zheng exercised an unusual amount of caution for him.</p>

  <p>Someone in the Oneness Sky Palace must have deciphered the two Sanskrit words on the yellow paper, but it was not yet clear just how much had been deciphered.</p>

  <p>Zheng recited to himself, and the white cyclone in his mind began to swirl again.</p>

  <p>He could recite one hundred words at most now, and the white cyclone was formed by around 10 words. He kept reciting and the cyclone in his mind grew larger and larger.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The light of the giant stone under his feet shone brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>Seeing Feng Ge coming at him at an unstoppable speed, Zheng put his feet on the control rune and the accelerating rune once more.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>His stone erupted with an equally incredible speed, allowing him to avoid the attack without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Though she missed, this did not deter Feng Ge. She turned decisively and dashed off towards Zheng again.</p>

  <p>The speed these two were now moving at was beyond comprehension. It was not about two giant stones chasing each other; it was like two warriors at the Other Shore Realm flying.</p>

  <p>"Konnor, are those stones weightless?" a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect asked as he raised his head, disbelieving his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Maybe..." Konnor replied. He couldn't believe what he saw either.</p>

  <p>At first, Konnor had just thought of Zheng as Milo's replacement, but now he rejoiced in secret because he had made the right choice. If Milo had come this time, the Flow Sword Sect would have been eliminated.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for any disciple in the Oneness Sky Palace to compete with Feng Ge. Konnor had invited Zheng to attend the Seven Mountains Meeting on an impulse and looked at what he was doing. Perhaps this was fate working its ways.</p>

  <p>Athemar, Goran and the others stood up and frowned at the scene below.</p>

  <p>They had been in power for a long time and so their eyes were sharpened more than most. The methods Zheng and Feng Ge used suggested that they had broken out of the limit of Instant Enlightenment. The secrets of their achievements deserved close attention to try and figure out.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has been to the Truth Library and borrowed the yellow paper,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, both Winchell and Goran raised their eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>Many people in the Oneness Sky Palace knew the origin of the yellow paper. Goran and Winchell had borrowed it before as well, but with their status, they didn't need to pay that many divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Many had borrowed the yellow paper, but none of them had found anything useful within its content.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was already perfect. It wouldn't work with one more word or one missing word. There was a heated debate about the last two Sanskrit words. Many thought them to be meaningless.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that those two Sanskrit words are the follow-up of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and Zheng has translated them?" Goran inquired incredulously.</p>

  <p>If this was true, it would certainly shock the entire Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"It's possible," Athemar said with a subdued nod.</p>

  <p>"But how about Feng Ge?" Goran asked again.</p>

  <p>Athemar stared at Feng Ge on the huge stone and said, "It could be that Eastern Emperor Taiyi has made some breakthroughs of his own."</p>

  <p>Historically, neither Eastern Emperor Taiyi nor the excellent decipherers of the Oneness Sky Palace were able to decipher the Sanskrit words, but that didn't mean they would never be able to figure them out.</p>

  <p>The structure of the Sanskrit words was complicated, and there were hundreds of millions of interpretations. If one were to study them for millions or even tens of millions of years, they could possibly find the correct one from the countless possibilities.</p>

  <p>"The Imperial Sword Seal only reacts to the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, this has never happened before, but today it happens to Feng Ge and Zheng at the same time. As far as I know, they haven't met each other before this," revealed Athemar, making light of the significance of what took place before them.</p>

  <p>"Let's see who will be the last standing," the old man said.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another collision rattled the cave with a deafening slam.</p>

  <p>Two more people behind Zheng were thrown off. Feng Ge had suffered more losses as well. She now had only six left standing on her giant rock.</p>

  <p>Even so, the fight in her eyes still burned strong. She backed off a little and stared at Zheng in a strangely calm manner. "Have you ever met my father?" she asked, confident that she knew the answer.</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback by Feng Ge attempting to speak to him while they were engaged in battle. He shook his head and replied, "No."</p>

  <p>"Liar! Who else could teach you the Truth Enlightenment?" Feng Ge sneered, filled with anger and derision.</p>

  <p>"The Truth Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>Zheng realized that the Truth Enlightenment she mentioned must have been deciphered from the two Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>'It seems that my guess is right. Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself has deciphered part of the two Sanskrit words, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why my father taught you this. But if you want to win, you will have to give it everything you have. No holding back." Feng Ge's face turned red and vicious.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The giant stone under her feet began to tremble.</p>

  <p>As soon as he felt Feng Ge's aura had changed, Zheng shouted to those behind him, "Get off the giant stone."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Why should we leave?"</p>

  <p>"We will fight with you!"</p>

  <p>Mekhi and the others could not understand why Zheng would ask them to abandon him. They couldn't bring themselves to do it, right when their help mattered the most.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me! I have a plan!" Zheng urged in a tone that allowed no retorts.</p>

  <p>Frowning in consideration, Mekhi clenched his jaw and waved his hand, leaving the giant stone together with the rest of his companions.</p>

  <p>Zheng was left alone on the giant stone. It sank a little as he now had to bear all two hundred divine megatons on his own.</p>

  <p>He began to recite the Truth Enlightenment. The white cyclone in his mind began to expand again.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stepped on her huge stone which immediately shot upwards, almost to the roof of the cave. After a beat, she began plummeting towards Zheng like a comet poised to destroy him.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't flinch. He rushed up with his giant stone to meet her. This battle would finally end now.</p>
