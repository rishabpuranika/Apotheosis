  <p>
</p>

  <p>The power in that sword strike was beyond anything Norvin had ever imagined and it caught him off guard!</p>

  <p>Nathan was a Godly Genius and his Mahayana Lotus Flower was in perfect state. Thus it was expected that he could send out an extremely formidable palm print which contained the force of great way.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman, on the other hand, was an ace talent whose Mahayana Lotus Flower had not yet reached the perfect state.</p>

  <p>Hence he could not have stepped into the Godly Way just yet.</p>

  <p>Norvin underestimated the Otherworldly Swordsman and that was his biggest mistake. The moment he attacked, Norvin wasn't prepared. He didn't expect that this seemingly ordinary Otherworldly Swordsman could release such immense power!</p>

  <p>His body started trembling and he was having trouble catching his breath. For the first time, he felt scared for his life.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman was just an ace talent, but the power that he released was far greater than Nathan's.</p>

  <p>Norvin could compare Nathan's comprehension of the Godly Way to a newly sprouting seed, while the power of Godly Way that this Otherworldly Swordsman had put into his sword strike was like a full-grown tree.</p>

  <p>This analogy, however, was based solely on the comprehension level of the Godly Way and had nothing to do with physical power and strength.</p>

  <p>But no matter how much Norvin thought about it, he still couldn't figure out how such an ace talent could harness this incredible power.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he wouldn't get a chance to find out.</p>

  <p>As the ordinary sword strike drew closer, Norvin was pushed to the edge and had no room to dodge. It pierced through his body and his blood slowly poured out from where the sword struck.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman had cast a contemptuous glance at Norvin.</p>

  <p>And when he was certain that the latter was done for, he had withdrawn his sword and returned into his stone.</p>

  <p>"Norvin from the ogre race has been defeated!"</p>

  <p>Many ogre warriors from different sacred places including the Supreme Lords and world lords were the rowdiest in the crowd during the fight between Norvin and the Otherworldly Swordsman. They were not in a good mood when he had lost in his last battle, so this time, they cheered on him from the top of their lungs.</p>

  <p>But as the news of his second defeat was announced, they became silent trying to comprehend what just happened.</p>

  <p>No one could believe that Norvin was defeated for the second time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the humans especially those in sacred places of the Thoughtless Minds were cheering with excitement and overflowing joy.</p>

  <p>"One move! It just took one move for the Otherworldly Swordsman to defeat Norvin! That's incredible!"</p>

  <p>"I knew it! The Otherworldly Swordsman is a supernormal talent.</p>

  <p>Although he is an ace talent, he can be at par with the Godly Genius when he uses his mysterious iron sword!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. I'm not sure how Norvin would move on from this! This time, he is a disgrace to the ogre race!"</p>

  <p>The warriors from the tens of thousands of sacred places in the Thoughtless Minds couldn't help but feel proud.</p>

  <p>Aside from them, the Humanity Alliance and the Blessed Buddha Land also felt overjoyed. This was a glorious moment for the human race.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that this ogre would be defeated by a human ace talent?</p>

  <p>These moments had bridged the gap between humans from different worlds and statuses. For a moment, their seemingly divided worlds were united. Chaos was set aside, and harmony was restored even for a short period.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, back in the Pure Jade Sacred Place, Preston was impressed by the turn of events. He said, "Quite impressive! The representatives from the Thoughtless Minds are quite remarkable talents! They did well this time! I'm afraid that those talents from the Thoughtless Minds will surpass those from the Humanity Alliance this time. I'm speechless!"</p>

  <p>The supreme worlds controlled by both the Humanity Alliance and the Thoughtless Minds were on the same level in terms of power. But the Thoughtless Minds' supreme worlds had far more resources, treasures, and talents than that of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Humanity Alliance was just formed by combining the forces of various human sacred places, while the Thoughtless Minds was a major force led by the four great clans with a strength that the Humanity Alliance could not measure up to.</p>

  <p>"These warriors are truly remarkable! They are powerful beyond measure!" Ning Yudie remarked. Although she did not understand the Otherworldly Swordsman's sword strike, she knew that the power within it was incredibly formidable.</p>

  <p>Preston thought he sensed the concern on Yudie's voice. He assumed that Ning Yudie got worried for Luo Luo Zheng after witnessing the previous fight. To calm her down a bit, Preston uttered, "It's already quite an accomplishment for Luo Luo Zheng to make it to the top three hundred, you see.</p>

  <p>Even if he fails to go further, he already made name for himself by lasting this long in the Illusion Battlefield. He will surely be given high status and great rewards once he returns to the Humanity Alliance..."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was stunned after hearing Preston's words. But she understood what he meant and appreciated why he did that. She just smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"I am not worried about Luo Luo Zheng. I know what he can do, and I have faith in him."</p>

  <p>"I see..." Preston replied. He looked at Ning Yudie and saw the confidence radiating through her face. A strange expression appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew about Luo Zheng's majestic strength and skills. But there were also even stronger ace talents and Godly Geniuses from various races in the Illusion Battlefield that he had yet to fight.</p>

  <p>Compared to those ace talents and Godly Geniuses, Luo Luo Zheng could be considered as mediocre in power and skill.</p>

  <p>But Preston didn't want to burst Yudie's bubble. So, politely, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Which rank do you think Luo Luo Zheng will get? In the top fifty? Top ten perhaps?"</p>

  <p>The top three hundred warriors could be regarded as ace talents. The warriors who could advance to the top fifty would only be the most powerful ace talents. But to make it to the top ten, they must either be Godly Geniuses or those at par with Godly Geniuses like the Otherworldly Swordsman.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie tilted her head, thought for a while, and then said, "I think he can make it to the top three. At least..."</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Preston didn't expect that response from Ning Yudie. With an awkward smile on his face, he replied, "I know how confident you are in your husband's strength, but I'm not sure if he can be among the top three warriors...</p>

  <p>I mean, no offense. I'm just trying to be realistic here."</p>

  <p>Preston couldn't help but smirk. Ning Yudie just slightly raised her eyebrows at Preston's remarks but just shrugged him off. She just couldn't stand Preston's annoying laugh.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie knew Luo Luo Zheng far better than anyone else, and she would always have faith in Luo Luo Zheng no matter what others would say.</p>

  <p>Back when she just had ascended to the Upper World, she had no clue of Luo Zheng's current situation and position. He was just a Life and Death Realm warrior before he rose into the Upper World, but just after spending six years in the Upper World, he had already greatly improved his strength beyond Yudie's expectation. The past six years that Luo Luo Zheng had spent in the Upper World was just a fraction of a second to his lifespan which she thought would be over ten thousand years.</p>

  <p>In Yudie's assessment, if Luo Luo Zheng had spent more time cultivating himself, he could become the greatest warrior in the universe!</p>

  <p>However, six years of training in the Upper World wasn't enough time for cultivation.</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, Luo Luo Zheng was bound to meet ace talents and Godly Geniuses from various forces. Some might think that he wasn't prepared enough to face them in a battle.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had always triumphed in his past competitions and he had never disappointed others with his performance. With this, Ning Yudie believed that he could make it into the top three!</p>

  <p>She chose not to refute Preston's remarks. It was enough for her to know how great Luo Luo Zheng was. Soon, she knew that Preston would regret making those remarks and would marvel at Luo Zheng's outstanding performance.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was probably no warrior who felt more dejected and morose than Norvin, the defeated ogre warrior.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he felt ultimately lucky to get chance to fight consecutively while other warriors didn't even have a chance to fight.</p>

  <p>But now, he was just too scared.</p>

  <p>He had lost the desire to compete against other warriors and would just want to leave this place.</p>

  <p>Norvin wasn't afraid to die inside. Besides, there was no dying inside the Illusion Battlefield after all.</p>

  <p>He was the kind of ogre that had high value for glory and triumph. But when he was put in the Heaven Earth Board and attacked by other powerful warriors, it felt like an endless torment for him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the battle on the Heaven Earth Board was something out of his control.</p>

  <p>In the Heaven Earth Board, no one could control who they fought with.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the first two stages where warriors could cherry-pick their targets, in this stage, they had no idea who they would be dealing with.</p>

  <p>The giant beautiful hand would select the warriors who would be facing each other and decide the rules and mysteries that would await them in the battlefield.</p>

  <p>And Norvin wasn't fond of surprises especially when it came to battles.</p>

  <p>He didn't like the uncertainty there was in this stage.</p>

  <p>He was just defeated by the Otherworldly Swordsman in a battle when suddenly, the stone under his feet was once again gripped by the giant hand!</p>

  <p>Norvin was dumbfounded! He wanted to oppose the decision, but he knew it would only be pointless.</p>

  <p>Unable to resist, he could only hope that his next opponent would be somehow inferior to him. He would be at the disadvantage if he faced the Godly Genius. However, he also didn't want to fight the weakest opponents as it wouldn't be any much of a thrill.</p>

  <p>With a long face, Norvin could not help but just watch the giant beautiful hand in front of him pick his opponent.</p>

  <p>The giant hand landed on another black stone.</p>

  <p>'Another human warrior?' Norvin's eyes widened as he glared at the human warrior. His body froze and his hands began to tremble. He was afraid of facing a human warrior again.</p>

  <p>Finally, the mysterious girl's voice announced the players.</p>

  <p>"Norvin of the ogre race versus the human warrior? Luo Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>' Luo Luo Zheng Luo?'</p>

  <p>Norvin was shocked. He felt like the stars were conspiring against him!</p>

  <p>The universe was so vast that not all remarkable ace talents were known to all the races. Most often than not, these remarkable ace talents were only known by their own races. That was why Norvin didn't recognize the Otherworldly Swordsman at the beginning.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was different from them.</p>

  <p>His name was known in almost the entire universe. There was no living creature that had not heard of his name? the humans, the ogres, the Demon Night members, the members of those insignificant small races, and countless ordinary mortals were all familiar with his name.</p>

  <p>Even the fierce beasts and animals with high intelligence knew his name.</p>

  <p>They could also hear and understand his words.</p>

  <p>After all, he had the Roaring Token. Whenever he would speak through this, his voice could spread throughout the whole universe and all intelligent living creatures in the universe would hear and understand him.</p>

  <p>But despite his fame, only a few warriors had seen his true strength.</p>

  <p>Those warriors were either the ones he had faced before or his dear friends.</p>
