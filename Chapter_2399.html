<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2399 The Girl On The Back Of A Bull </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the four corners of the divine land stood the four divine trees, all in different positions.</p>

  <p>The Ray Tree helped strengthen the Dongfang Clan, which ranked first and enjoyed long lasting prosperity courtesy of the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree was located in the west of the divine land, where the Sword Clan lived. Their Floating Island was ranked second in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Three forces occupied the Hidden Tree, namely the Moon Sect, the War God Hall, and the Mysterious Soul Building. They worked together to form the Moon Clan, whose Floating Island ranked third.</p>

  <p>Those top three clans were known as the most powerful above the Time Sea, and it was virtually impossible for an ordinary clan to overthrow them. Those three clans relied on the three divine trees in the divine land, which was why their resources were far richer and more abundant than those of the ordinary clans.</p>

  <p>As for the Lofty Tree in the north of the divine land, it was a divine tree that changed constantly.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Tree changed every once in a while? sometimes it was a place of ice and snow, and sometimes it was a hell of flames. It was certainly not a suitable place for races to live in.</p>

  <p>As of the current divine era, the Lofty Tree gave off a strong sense of death, so its surrounding area was devoid of life as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned upon hearing Hallet's words. "Non-combat Zone? What do you mean by that?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>He knew that there were four divine trees in the divine land, but they all stood near the edges. He had never been to those places yet.</p>

  <p>"There is a miraculous thing in the area of the Sunrest Tree. When this thing is activated, no one is allowed to fight within the area," Hallet answered.</p>

  <p>"No one is allowed to fight within the area?" Luo Zheng was confused. "Will I be punished if I fight someone else?"</p>

  <p>Battles were not allowed in many areas in the divine land. The stone slabs would punish anyone who offended the rule. Such a thing was rather common.</p>

  <p>"It's not like what you think. It's impossible to fight in the Non-combat Zone. If you enter the Non-combat Zone, you will be infected by a strange atmosphere and you will not be able to fight with others," Hallet said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Not even Holy Beings are exempted?" "Right, even Holy Beings are not exempted," Hallet nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm aware that you don't understand that feeling right now, but you will know when you are in the zone."</p>

  <p>"The Non-combat Zone is quite unique." True to Hallet's analysis, the time when Luo Zheng had entered the divine land was very important.</p>

  <p>His father would definitely have things planned. If he based his speculations on the timeline, then he would absolutely participate in the debate over the Divine Dao next.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether Harold and Yan would go to the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>The Everest Spirit Mountain was a vast land.</p>

  <p>The mountain range was ten thousand miles high, spreading around one circle after another. A tall, impossibly huge mountain stood in the middle of the mountain range.</p>

  <p>That humongous mountain was the famous Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, low-rank True Gods could only explore the surrounding mountains around the Everest Spirit Mountain most of the time.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a patch of a green ancient forest in the middle of the mountain range shook violently.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>But that was not all.</p>

  <p>Three figures suddenly shot out of the ancient forest and dashed down the mountain.</p>

  <p>"You guys run! I'll guard the rear!" said a mid-rank True God with a large saber in his hand.</p>

  <p>He was heavily wounded, and blood had stained the pristine white of his robe. He was more than exhausted that he now relied on his extremely strong willpower.</p>

  <p>"No! Let's run together!" another mid-rank True God yelled back.</p>

  <p>A small avalanche of dirt rolled along the slopes as the three mid-rank True Gods ran down the mountain ridge.</p>

  <p>Just then, the ground seemed to quake with thunderous footsteps.</p>

  <p>About eight fierce bulls came out of the woods and headed straight for them!</p>

  <p>The red-eyed bulls were thickly muscled, and their sharp horns emitted wisps of black flames.</p>

  <p>Despite their huge bodies, the bulls were quite agile on the rocky mountain slope. They even rushed towards the mid-rank True Gods in a swift and nimble manner.</p>

  <p>Those bulls were classified as third-grade beasts in the Everest Spirit Mountain? the Brutal Bulls. They were found all over the Everest Spirit Mountain. They were hot tempered, rough and thick-skinned, and had a strong hatred for others. Very few True Gods were willing to go near these Brutal Bulls.</p>

  <p>Those three men were the True Gods of the Bai Clan, one of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>They had lost contact with their clan members while they explored the Everest Spirit Mountain, and their encounter with the bulls was not the first time they had been in danger.</p>

  <p>They never expected to come across the Brutal Bulls, and they had no choice but to run away as they were no match for those beasts.</p>

  <p>After the three of them had run dozens of miles on the uneven mountain ridge, their leader suddenly halted.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" one of the True Gods questioned. "There is no way ahead of us," he answered.</p>

  <p>There in front of them, was a deep and huge canyon. "Good heavens?"</p>

  <p>If the canyon was in some ordinary mountain range, then it would be nothing to the three mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>It was true that the mid-rank True Gods couldn't fly, but those True Gods from powerful clans had their own means.</p>

  <p>They weren't afraid of heights that were even hundreds of thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>The canyon in the forbidden area of the Everest Spirit Mountain, however, had water flowing from the unknown. Anyone who fell into the water would never return. If the three of them jumped, then they would surely die!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the Brutal Bulls finally caught up to them.</p>

  <p>The bulls' footprints left traces of black flames as they continued to press forward towards the three mid-rank True Gods of the Bai Clan.</p>

  <p>"Brother, what should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Shall we jump into the water?"</p>

  <p>"No! If we jump, we'll be dead for sure. We should fight against these Brutal Bulls. Maybe one of us can escape!"</p>

  <p>With those words, the three of them all brought out their best weapons to fight for their lives. Red filled their eyes as they prepared to really fight for their lives.</p>

  <p>After a while, things slightly changed. The group of Brutal Bulls now walked towards them slowly instead. The beasts occasionally glared at them with their fiery red eyes, but they didn't attack.</p>

  <p>The three mid-rank True Gods finally cooled down. They looked at each other in confusion. They had no idea what was happening.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they attack us?"</p>

  <p>"The Brutal Bulls are not intelligent creatures, and they also don't have wisdom. Something is wrong..."</p>

  <p>At that point, a clear, commanding voice cut through the air.</p>

  <p>"Hi, which clan are you from?"</p>

  <p>A light pink cloth shoe gently tapped on a hard surface. Lush fabric of a dress fluttered gently in the air. In front of them stood a girl who seemed to be at the age of seventeen or eighteen. She stood on the back of a bull with her tiptoes, and looked down at the True Gods with piqued interest.</p>

  <p>"Who...who are you?"</p>

  <p>The three mid-rank True Gods from the Bai Clan stared at the girl on the back of the bull, their faces full of vigilance.</p>

  <p>Although the girl was truly beautiful and her innocent face shone brightly with a kind smile that was definitely far from being harmful, her sudden appearance at a dangerous circumstance seemed strange.</p>

  <p>It looked like those Brutal Bulls were under her control. "Answer me, which clan are you from?" the girl asked indifferently and stared at the three men.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice because of their precarious situation, the three True Gods had to answer. The mid-rank True God who took the lead mustered his courage and answered, "We are from the Bai Clan. The Bai Clan is a powerful clan above the Time Sea. My name is Lange Bai. This is my junior brother, Jarred Bai. That is my another junior brother? "</p>

  <p>"Wait! I didn't ask your names..."</p>

  <p>The young girl didn't expect that the mid-rank True God would actually introduce themselves. Her eyebrows were furrowed and she looked a little helpless, but nonetheless charming. She was incomparably beautiful.</p>

  <p>"I just want to know something from you. If you can answer me honestly, I will protect you from being in danger until you leave the Everest Spirit Mountain safely," the girl added.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what she said, the three mid-rank True Gods lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know who she was, she could protect them until they left because they saw how she calmed down the Brutal Bulls.</p>

  <p>"What is it then? If I know it, I will tell you everything!" said Lange Bai as he bowed to her respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened in the Floating Islands after their rankings have been determined?" As she spoke, her eyes flashed with a strange light.</p>
