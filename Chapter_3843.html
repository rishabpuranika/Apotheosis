<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's words put into the light the current situation of this world to Ziya.</p>

  <p>When a round of chaos ended, a destructive power would eliminate everything in the entire world.</p>

  <p>After that, if no new intelligent lives managed to be birthed, then the world would exist as nothing more than a shell.</p>

  <p>Ziya nodded. "You're right. Maybe the Purge Way and the Nihility Way also existed in this world and the ones who believed in the latter dominated everyone and destroyed everything. Or maybe the Purge Way won. They limited the number of creatures in a very small range and hid themselves somewhere in these caves."</p>

  <p>This world was infinitely vast and trying to locate that small number of creatures was even more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>Either way, they knew the Finale Way in this world had failed.</p>

  <p>"Is there also an Other Shore in this world?" Luo Nian asked. Ziya couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at Luo Nian's question.</p>

  <p>"It's possible. Why not come with me to see if there is one!"</p>

  <p>Since the three thousand Divine Dao worked in this world then the Truths of Divine Dao must be the same since they were derived from the Instant Civilization, a far more superior civilization from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>They should be more universal than the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had completely mastered the Truth of Cultivation Nature under the Green Jade Spirit's guidance, however, Luo Zheng never allowed him to leave his inner world. He still hadn't even gotten the chance to enter the Sea of Truth, yet here was Ziya inviting him to explore the Other Shore of this strange world.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Ziya sat cross-legged in the air and clapped four consecutive times in all directions. Four palm shadows appeared around him that held faint sword shadows. These sword shadows slowly rotated around him and Luo Nian protectively.</p>

  <p>This world seemed devoid of all lives but it was never unwise to carry a bit of protection.</p>

  <p>The two of them then began to recite the Truths of Divine Dao and tried to enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the yellow, poisonous mist around the area headed towards them.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the two of them were surrounded by it.</p>

  <p>A trace of curiosity appeared on Ziya's face. "Can the Truths of Divine Dao attract the poisonous mist?"</p>

  <p>Back when they cultivated the Truths of Divine Dao in the chaos, they never attracted chaotic energy like this. Then again, this world was vastly different from the chaos.</p>

  <p>As the two of them continued to recite, the whole world began to spin around them.</p>

  <p>Newcomers to the Other Shore of the chaos would first arrive in the Sea of Truth but subsequent visits would lead them to the exact spot of their last exit.</p>

  <p>Since this was the first time Ziya and Luo Nian entered the Other Shore of this world, they couldn't help but wonder if there was also a Sea of Truth here.</p>

  <p>As the sky and earth spun, they felt as if their minds were bombarded by relentless thunder. Just as it was about to become unbearable, they found themselves in a yellow world with nothing but clouds and mist.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian swept his gaze around their surroundings. "Have we entered the Other Shore of this world?"</p>

  <p>As he looked around, he found a small armada of creatures about to approach.</p>

  <p>Scorpions with six pairs of compound eyes, snakes whose bodies were covered with thorns, jumbo-sized mosquitoes of varied colors ? all sorts of poisonous creatures were now crawling their way towards them.</p>

  <p>Ziya frowned at the sudden appearance of these curious life-forms. "Are they Other Shore creatures?" he muttered to himself. Their arrival had been smooth and even if there were a lot of critters headed for them, they didn't seem to be that intelligent nor threatening.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the poisonous creatures were quick to make their aggression known.</p>

  <p>Having discovered these two newcomers, they hissed angrily and came upon them in a mad rush.</p>

  <p>Ziya didn't even lift a finger but he somehow managed to eliminate all the oncoming creatures within a hundred feet radius through a series of lightning bolts that struck the ground.</p>

  <p>Since there were too many creatures, their corpses soon piled up around them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ziya quickly grabbed Luo Nian's hand and flew onto the poisonous mist and left the pile of corpses behind.</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be a Sea of Truth here," Luo Nian muttered in observation.</p>

  <p>"The layout of the Other Shore is arranged through the will of the Instant Civilization. Even if there is no Sea of Truth, there is still this endless poisonous fog," Ziya told him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this poisonous fog was a piece of cake for Ziya and he could also protect Luo Nian from it. However, the natives of this world would've no doubt suffered from this deadly fog as they entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>This yellowish fog of death seemed boundless and filled every inch of the air.</p>

  <p>The two of them continued to travel through the mist for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>Ziya, with his abilities, could afford to travel like that for months, even years, yet experience no sort of fatigue. Luo Nian, however, soon grew stiff and tired from the long and boring trip.</p>

  <p>It was only twenty hours later that they finally reached the end.</p>

  <p>What awaited them was a vast void of brownish-yellow energy currents.</p>

  <p>When they looked down, they noticed that the edge of the earth was sharp and indented, like broken porcelain.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian couldn't help but gasp in astonishment. "The earth is shattered, Master Ziya!"</p>

  <p>Ziya nodded solemnly. "I'm afraid the whole Other Shore of this world has been destroyed. Shattered into pieces with nothing left but this void."</p>

  <p>It was worse than what he had first expected. The Other Shore of this world should've survived the end of the world since it was supposed to be a permanent shelter for the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't seem to be that way. The Other Shore of this world wasn't able to escape its doom.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya," Luo Nian called out to him as he pointed towards something in the distance. "Look over there."</p>

  <p>Among the scattered energy currents was a floating remnant of the destroyed earth. It wasn't big but they could see a silhouette of low buildings on it.</p>

  <p>Ziya immediately grabbed Luo Nian's hand.</p>

  <p>"Come with me!" he exclaimed as they flew towards the remnant.</p>

  <p>A look of hesitation crossed Luo Nian's features. "Aren't you afraid of the energy currents, Master Ziya?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian felt an instinctive fear for the formidable power contained within the currents that filled the void. So long as he brushed against the tiniest amount of energy, he would completely corrode into nothingness.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I can withstand them!" he assured the young man.</p>

  <p>Ziya, after all, was an Eternal Realm master with the root-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>He also stayed in the Deleting Space for a long time which led to the exponential growth of his power. He ranked at the very top when it came to strength. These currents would not harm him one bit.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As they flew into the void, they got closer and closer towards the floating remnant the size of a small island.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the two of them arrived.</p>

  <p>The sight that awaited them caught Luo Nian by surprise. "There are so many houses here!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The buildings were small and low, only around the height of Luo Nian's waist. These tiny buildings densely covered the island to the point that the two newcomers couldn't figure out where to set their feet on.</p>

  <p>"Show yourselves!" Ziya suddenly shouted.</p>

  <p>He was no fool.</p>

  <p>The moment they landed, he was able to sense the existence of numerous Other Shore creatures that hid underneath these buildings.</p>

  <p>Their arrival had scared these creatures which led them to hide in the caves that were underneath each structure.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian couldn't help but sigh helplessly. "Master Ziya, you shouldn't scare them..."</p>

  <p>They were strangers and Ziya's attitude wasn't helping them gain these creatures' trust.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, we don't mean you any harm. We just want to investigate something and hope to communicate with you," Luo Nian explained in a calm, sincere tone.</p>

  <p>Perhaps his friendliness worked as a rustling sound came from one of the buildings. Soon enough, a short, furry creature emerged. He looked quite strange especially with that transparent poison sac filled with bright yellow venom on top of his head.</p>

  <p>It seemed that all the creatures in this world, whether intelligent or not, were related to poison in some way.</p>
