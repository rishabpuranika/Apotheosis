<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng could also condense flames in sea water.</p>

  <p>However, the sea water in the Sea of Truth was deemed to be something out of the ordinary. The candle emitted a silver light, which was unusual.</p>

  <p>The end of the water tornado was just right above the silver flame. This meant the candle was responsible for the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the candle's sudden appearance was also considered to be a bizarre thing in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"The candle suddenly appeared here. And after it was lit up, a huge whirlpool appeared. I'm guessing someone must have arranged this," Zheng said as he stared at the peculiar candle.</p>

  <p>"Well, they must have spent a lot of money on it. After all, it is a good treasure," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Curious, Zheng asked, "They? Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, just a bunch of arrogant guys. It's not important for you to know the details now," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, Zheng moved a few steps forward and approached the mysterious candle. As soon as he had a glimpse of it, he gave off a wary vibe.</p>

  <p>Whoever placed the candle in the Sea of Truth would most likely arrange a defense mechanism for it in case of any accidents. Moreover, based on No. 9527's words, those responsible for the candle's presence must be very powerful and influential creatures.</p>

  <p>If Zheng waned to destroy the candle, then he must take utmost precaution and be very careful in doing so.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I don't think they ever expected that someone can enter the Sea of Truth with a physical body," No. 9527 assumed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess you are right!"</p>

  <p>It was not a secret that the Soul of Light would definitely die after falling into the Sea of Truth. So if it were Zheng who placed the candle there, he would not be too worried about its safety.</p>

  <p>After thinking about this, Zheng quickly stretched his hand out and grabbed the candle.</p>

  <p>But as soon as Zheng touched the candle, there was a force of resistance that pushed his hand away from it.</p>

  <p>In an instant, rays of dark green light emerged and surrounded the candle like a force field. Swirling around the candle, the green light split into four balls. The balls' surfaces were bulged continuously, and they turned into four bats that were as tall as a normal person!</p>

  <p>Moreover, these bats emitted the strong soul power and a kind of unknown, special Truth of Godly Way!</p>

  <p>Zheng began to quickly back away after seeing the bats come to life. "These bats are also Souls of Light... No, they are much stronger than a Soul of Light!"</p>

  <p>What he saw in front of him was really out of the ordinary. After a while, he still could not put things together as his judgment brought him more confusion.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he thought, 'This is the depths of the Sea of Truth. Any Soul of Light would be instantly melted away if it falls in here. But why aren't these bats being melted? Something's not right.'</p>

  <p>Surely, that was not the perfect time to be thinking of such questions. At that moment, the bats spread and flapped their broad wings in the sea water and quickly dashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…"</p>

  <p>The green bats flew very fast that Zheng did not have a chance to dodge them at all.</p>

  <p>In a flash, one of the bats reached Zheng. Its face was the same size as a fist and bore two sharp fangs. Angrily, it kept on flapping its wings in front of Zheng until it bit him ferociously.</p>

  <p>Avoiding any more bites from the fierce bat, Zheng tilted his head slightly.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately, this only gave the bat another chance to bite him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Zheng might have overestimated the bat's fangs. Fortunately, the fangs of the bat were not as strong as Zheng thought as they failed to pierce through his skin!</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned to see that there was nothing to be afraid of, and a smile appeared on his face. Feeling unharmed, he turned his hand around and grabbed the huge bat with his hand.</p>

  <p>Once a person's soul had grown to a certain level, it would be able to split a rock or even a big mountain. When the soul turned into the Soul of Light, the sense of touch it caused was similar to that of an ordinary object. In the bats' case, although they surpassed the Soul of Light, their strength could not hold a candle to that of a real body, especially Zheng's body which had been tempered and strengthened numerous times.</p>

  <p>As soon as he put his strength on his tight grip, the huge bat was torn into two pieces.</p>

  <p>Being torn apart, the bat immediately transformed into two green light balls which slowly flew away from Zheng. Afterwards, they merged into one, changing back into the huge green bat again.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, Zheng was not in the mood to deal with such thing. The three other bats sensed that he had killed one of them, so they surrounded him in turn.</p>

  <p>But these green bats did not have any intelligence. Although they knew that their attacks were quite useless, they did not have the concept of retreat. As a result, they rushed forward one after the other, trying to tear Zheng with their sharp fangs.</p>

  <p>With their fangs being useless, Zheng immediately tore them in half.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, they turned into the green balls they once were, making it a cycle of birth and death.</p>

  <p>"If this whole cycle thing persists, then it's impossible for me to kill these bats! I've been going in circles already..."</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was not threatened by the bats' bites, he still found it very annoying that no matter what he did, the bats did not die.</p>

  <p>"How is it possible that you can't kill them? You must take a closer look at these bats' sizes," No. 9527 reminded him.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, Zheng started to observe them and noticed that three of them had apparently become smaller than their initial size.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Zheng understood that the bats' soul power would be sharply consumed after their rebirth!</p>

  <p>Now that he learned more about the bats, it would now be easier for Zheng to deal with them.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng rushed forward and allowed the bats to attack him in return. Each time a bat came close to him, Zheng would instantly use his bare hands to tear it apart.</p>

  <p>After an hour of fighting, the bats had now been reduced to the size of a fist. Compared to their initial size of being as tall as a human, they had certainly shrunk with Zheng's method of attack.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because they didn't have enough soul power, their transformation speed became slower and slower until eventually, the green light they materialized could no longer condense and completely dissipated in the sea water!</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that the candle wasn't protected?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, No. 9527 responded, "If they had really tried to prevent you from attacking the candle, then I'm afraid that you would have been shattered by now. These Souls of Light can only defeat those weak creatures in the Sea of Truth..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng slightly nodded his head.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong these bats were, it could not be denied that they were just souls. If Zheng's Soul of Light encountered these green bats, then he probably wouldn't have a chance at victory. The souls of these bats were comparable to the souls of the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how strong the souls were, they were still unable to defeat Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>This meant that those who arranged the candle in the Sea of Truth were definitely not targeted at Zheng.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the bats, Zheng approached the candle again. He held the candle in his hand and the flames began to sway. Moreover, the water tornado that was as thick as a thumb also moved!</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the huge whirlpool also started to move.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dorothy and the others were leaning on the edge of the large whirlpool. As it moved, Dorothy could not help but show a slight trace of shock on her face. Then, she said, "Eh? Is the whirlpool... moving?"</p>

  <p>It was not just her who noticed the movement, but the others who were with her.</p>

  <p>"It is moving! The whirlpool has even moved a few feet!"</p>

  <p>"How could this be? It is impossible! Once the huge whirlpool appears, it will be permanently fixed..."</p>

  <p>"I've never heard that the big whirlpool can move!"</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene with their own eyes, several warriors from different races on the Truth Boats also let out strange voices as they exchanged their ideas on what was happening.</p>

  <p>'Did Zheng make it move?' Dorothy thought in her head as she blinked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>This was just her hypothesis. Although she had high hopes about this, she also knew very well that it could not be that simple to move such a great whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng carried the candle underwater. As he swam, the straight water tornado seemed to follow him closely.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a while about what he should do next. Afterwards, he stretched out his fingers and pinched the silver flame to extinguish it directly.</p>

  <p>As soon as he put out the candle's flame, the water tornado seemed to have followed suit as it vanished without a trace.</p>
