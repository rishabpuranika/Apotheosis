<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>The exile wasn't expecting anyone to arrive first. It happened so fast that he couldn't even tell who Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>But the moment he finished speaking, the flying knife had already pierced his forehead.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before the exile fell to the ground, Luo Zheng had pulled out his long sword and held it forward.</p>

  <p>The other three exiles reacted fast.</p>

  <p>But with Luo Zheng using the bloodline token, they had no chance of defeating him even during a head-on battle. And Luo Zheng was attacking them in a rather unique manner? they had no means to resist the attacks.</p>

  <p>Every single one of them could hardly manage to resist. In the end, they were all killed under Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the other side, Emily had ordered the group to kill the Wights.</p>

  <p>Because everyone grew more and more proficient in dealing with the Wights, the latter no longer posed as a great threat.</p>

  <p>About five minutes later, the last Wight was slain by Timotheus' saber.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Emily, and the others observed the elevated platforms from a distance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure appeared at the very back of the platforms. He gestured to the others with his thumb and smiled easily before disappearing into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"This guy..." The scene left Timotheus dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Originally, he didn't think that bringing Luo Zheng into this world would make such a difference.</p>

  <p>The rest of the exiles were stunned speechless? it was such a strange thing. So many of them had died under Luo Zheng, a mere True God.</p>

  <p>But Emily chuckled and called out, "Everyone, move on!"</p>

  <p>After another ten miles, the Wights stood in their way once again.</p>

  <p>From the shadows, Luo Zheng emerged and merely killed the lurking men again using thunderous methods. Everyone moved forward smoothly after that.</p>

  <p>On the way, the exiles from the great races and the Wild Gods seemed to grow in their admiration.</p>

  <p>None of them could figure out what particular method Luo Zheng had used to easily wipe out their opponents.</p>

  <p>In spite of the mystery, they also found themselves fortunate to have Luo Zheng on their team. Otherwise, they didn't know how many of them would perish.</p>

  <p>And so the group continued moving forward.</p>

  <p>Three days later, they finally stepped out of the densely packed high platforms. Before them was a wall that stood over ten feet high.</p>

  <p>"We're finally here," Zelda said, taking a step ahead and looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>Luther's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>It was the Warden race's gathering place, Zelda and Luther's hometown.</p>

  <p>Growing up, Luther had spent much of his time there. After going through disputes, slaughter, and exploration, he had finally returned. His heart was filled with mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>"There are people on the wall!" one of the Wild Gods shouted.</p>

  <p>Everyone then looked towards the wall and found several figures emerging one after another.</p>

  <p>"It's Spark," Emily announced as murderous intent flashed in her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>In the past, powerful exiles like Timotheus and Spark submitted only to her.</p>

  <p>But this time, as she planned to leave the world, Spark had decided to stir up trouble for the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>This time, she was also injured because of this person.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that she was in a hurry to leave the world, she might have already led the Snake Goddess warriors to destroy the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Atop the wall, Spark stood tall and examined the people in the distance indifferently.</p>

  <p>Now, he was full of doubts.</p>

  <p>None of Spark's exiles had returned.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Tyler had been defeated... But what about the others? Did they all fail?</p>

  <p>The conditions the Warden race had created gave them a great advantage. Just what method did Emily have up her sleeves to kill the warriors so quietly?</p>

  <p>All of Spark's former confidence was now destroyed.</p>

  <p>Emily led the group to the bottom of the city wall.</p>

  <p>The two sides were several thousand feet apart as they stared at each other in heavy silence.</p>

  <p>"Spark, we meet again!" Timotheus announced with a grin.</p>

  <p>Spark merely threw him an indifferent glance and snorted. "Timotheus?</p>

  <p>You have no right to open your mouth here!"</p>

  <p>The words greatly displeased Ramzi, Leopold, and the members of the Nine Li race. One could see their brows furrow in anger.</p>

  <p>Just when Ramzi was ready to retort, Timotheus stopped him with a shrug and mocking smile. "You're merely a trapped beast that has lost control over its limbs. You've got nothing but your mouth to use!"</p>

  <p>Paying no mind to Timotheus, Spark turned to Emily and said, "They want to make a deal with you."</p>

  <p>And by 'they', Spark meant the Warden race.</p>

  <p>Because the group of warriors had arrived smoothly, people figured that it was because of Emily's ability.</p>

  <p>This struck fear within Spark and the Warden race.</p>

  <p>With her hands behind her back, Emily smiled faintly and asked, "What kind of deal?"</p>

  <p>"You can lead the members of the Snake Goddess race and leave this place," Spark said.</p>

  <p>To that, the large races' exiles and Wild Gods widened their eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>Though everyone had finally arrived at the core area of this world, they hadn't really directly fought the Warden race just yet. At this point, no one could yet determine the winner.</p>

  <p>Spark's offer was rather tempting.</p>

  <p>In the silence, everyone's eyes were fixed on Emily. If she actually agreed to it, what were they going to do?</p>

  <p>"It's too late. If you said that before I found this world, there might have been a chance. I'm not stupid enough to say 'yes' now." Emily smiled smugly. "They want the Snake Goddess race to leave? they're already afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid? Why?" Spark sneered.</p>

  <p>"Judging from Zelda's and Luther's strength, the Warden race isn't all that strong."</p>

  <p>They already had their inklings about the Warden race's strength, but Zelda's and Luther's appearance had confirmed them.</p>

  <p>Before Spark answered, a figure clad in black popped up from the city wall. A woman's voice resounded, "You are right. The cultivation base of the members of our Warden race is indeed inferior to yours. But don't forget, you're not the Other Shore Realm warrior? you're just as ordinary as the mortal under the influence of the Strength Equalizing token.</p>

  <p>Our Warden race has received the master's privilege. We can break through the limit of the Strength Equalizing token."</p>

  <p>The woman in the black robe stepped out of the shadows and revealed herself as a member of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts skipped a beat while they were hearing these words.</p>

  <p>If the Warden race was truly capable of breaking through the limits, all the rest would be in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>Before the Strength Equalizing token was activated, they were strong, but after being equalized, their strength faded away. No matter how weak the Warden race was, they were still True Gods. And a single True God was enough to defeat them all.</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to this bullshit. It's impossible for them to completely break from the restrictions of the Strength Equalizing token," Zelda announced, walking out from the crowd.</p>
