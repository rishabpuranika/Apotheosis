<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey didn't find any difficulty in reading the Sanskrit words. It seemed that he had an inherent talent in deciphering them and seeing the hidden information within them.</p>

  <p>When he first saw these rings, he wasn't able to clearly read the contents.</p>

  <p>However, right after Elder Xue read a few words according to the ring patterns, the ring patterns suddenly became comprehensible before his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was as if he had already used these words for many years, so he could easily read them like it was his native tongue.</p>

  <p>"You can really read them?" Elder Xue asked as he was surprised.</p>

  <p>Just to make sure, Geoffrey shifted his gaze to the other ring patterns, scanned them a few more times and then nodded. "Yes, I can understand them..."</p>

  <p>"That's fascinating. How did that happen?" Elder Xue was speechless in surprise for a moment. "It's a little difficult for me to decipher these ring patterns, and sometimes the translation is not accurate. Please help me decipher them!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had always wanted to be of help if it was within his ability.</p>

  <p>Thus, with Elder Xue's strong request, he immediately agreed and began reading the ring patterns.</p>

  <p>"The Levitation Tower is five hundred feet high. If one is able to climb the uppermost area of the tower, then they could become its master and would be qualified to obtain the Heavenly Ring Staff, the sacred object of the Fostering race.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff is the foundation of the Fostering race. It can freely control all forms of energy.</p>

  <p>This item is very important, and couldn't just fall into the hands of anyone.</p>

  <p>Only the one who is the most powerful and worthy can attain it. If one desires to get it, then they need to pass the tests of the Levitation Tower first."</p>

  <p>While Geoffrey was reading these words, Elder Xue's eyes lit up. He always knew that the Fostering race had some treasure or weapon that matched the heavy sword, but he had no idea what exactly was it.</p>

  <p>However, through Geoffrey, he had learned what it was and even heard its true name? the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue refrained from interrupting Geoffrey as he read the ring patterns, and he listened intently to every word that was said. The three members of the Elemental race just stayed quietly at the side since they weren't in a hurry.</p>

  <p>The Elemental race and the other Deep Space races found the ring patterns of no use. Since the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race had long been gone and had been destroyed for so many years, the six large Deep Space races that appeared afterward were still in a savage stage.</p>

  <p>Even though they had the strength, they didn't bother creating their own civilization, and their attainment in the ring patterns was close to none.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the members of the five large Deep Space races outside the Levitation Tower were even more baffled.</p>

  <p>Normally, after they entered the Levitation Tower, all of the creatures' instinct was to rush to the top at their fastest speed. No one would dawdle and stay on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Outside the tower, most of the creatures saw the five rays of green light coming from the Elemental race staying on the first floor. They were confused about what they were trying to do there.</p>

  <p>"The Fostering race has obtained the inheritance of the World of No Limits, and we are the rightful ruler of the Stellar World. Since the very beginning, we have treated the Cinnabar race as our enemy. On the 10, 000th Rippling Water Day, our race managed to slaughter three thousand masters of the Cinnabar race; on the 90, 000th Scorching Fire Day, we broke through thirteen of their lands; and..."</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the ring patterns, the Foster race briefly introduced the Levitation Tower. However, the latter parts seemed to only contain a detailed record of the past battles between the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey agreed to read the ring patterns in hopes that he could find some clues on the first floor in order to pass through the Levitation Tower, but those clues were nowhere to be found on them. Instead, for the most part, they were comprised of the history of the Fostering race's development.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Geoffrey got bored while reading them. He suddenly stopped in the middle of a text and asked, "Elder Xue, do I still need to continue reading this part?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course! This is important!" Elder Xue was so engrossed in the history of the Fostering race.</p>

  <p>As an elder of the Bold Conjecture House, he felt like it was his obligation to explore the world. Thus, if this kind of information was right before his eyes, how could he miss such a very rare opportunity?</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Elder Xue's response, Geoffrey couldn't help rolling his eyes and continued reading.</p>

  <p>From the ten thousandth to the three trillionth Rippling Water Day, the Fostering race had gone through prosperity, rise, conquest, and decline.</p>

  <p>With their fierce war against the Cinnabar race, both of them perished together in the end.</p>

  <p>After deciphering and reading the last ring pattern, Elder Xue patted Geoffrey on his shoulder with a look of extreme satisfaction. "Now, let's go up!"</p>

  <p>The inner part of the Levitation Tower was spiral in structure. As they climbed up ten feet along the spiral staircase, a red line suddenly appeared under their feet and blocked their way. Upon seeing this, they immediately stopped and put their guards up.</p>

  <p>Even without Elder Xue warning them, Geoffrey knew that once they crossed that red line, they might die on the spot.</p>

  <p>Just as they steadily approached the red line, they felt that a strand of consciousness attempted to simultaneously enter their minds.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, it's a test for the soul..." Elder Xue said as if he had already expected this.</p>

  <p>During his long years of staying in the Deep Space, he had experienced countless failures. Thus he already had a rough deduction of what to expect within the first two hundred feet of the Levitation Tower.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, can I pass this test?" Geoffrey asked nervously.</p>

  <p>Although he currently had a cultivation base of a True God, his soul was still not very strong. In fact, he was far inferior to an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>It meant that even the soul of an ordinary creature in the Deep Space was stronger than Geoffrey's. The moment the creature released a little soul pressure, Geoffrey's soul would be in great danger of being extinguished.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry. The tests in the Levitation Tower have nothing to do with one's strength. Otherwise, most of the creatures that would dare to enter the tower might pass. Don't resist the consciousness," Elder Xue tried to console him.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that there weren't powerful warriors among the six large races of the Deep Space. However, the tests of the Levitation Tower were far from ordinary. For the past years, more and more powerful warriors failed to pass the tests in the tower. Therefore, the six large races decided to stop sending their powerful warriors because they had already lost so many powerful members in it.</p>

  <p>After all, every powerful member was necessary for their races to thrive.</p>

  <p>Once there was an imbalance in terms of the number and strength of one race, the other races would surely take advantage of this and annihilate this weaker race.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey followed Elder Xue's advice and the consciousness freely entered Geoffrey's mind. The moment it touched his soul, a simple question surfaced in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>As he heard the question, a strange expression quickly appeared on his face. He wasn't expecting this kind of simple question.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Elder Xue and the other three members of the Elemental race showed the same strange reactions on their faces. Soon after, Elder Xue calmed himself and reminded them, "Just relax and answer the question honestly."</p>

  <p>'Answer honestly?</p>

  <p>So am I to introduce myself?' Geoffrey thought with slight hesitation.</p>

  <p>Right now, he just had to trust what Elder Xue said, so he answered, "My name is Geoffrey Luo... I'm from the chaos."</p>

  <p>No one exactly knew what the correct answer was. At that moment, Geoffrey just simply conveyed what he thought when asked with that question.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey told his self-introduction, a gap appeared from the red line beneath his feet. From the gap, two green lines extended, forming a path to advance.</p>

  <p>"Whew, that's pretty easy."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shrugged as he let out a sigh.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Elder Xue and the members of the Elemental race also finished answering the question asked by the consciousness. A passageway outlined by green lines also appeared beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>With this, they continued to go up along the green lines.</p>

  <p>After they managed to climb up some distance, the wisp of consciousness raised a new question.</p>

  <p>"What is your dream?"</p>

  <p>'Dream? That is so vague.'</p>

  <p>Geoffrey slightly tilted his head and was reluctant to answer the question right away.</p>

  <p>He thought that if the answer was based on the logic of the test from the Fostering race, then it should probably be something connected with saving the world or the people.</p>

  <p>But Geoffrey didn't know if that was how he should answer in this test.</p>

  <p>When Elder Xue saw that Geoffrey was hesitating, he reminded him again, "Just answer it honestly!"</p>

  <p>Through Elder Xue's abundant experiences, he already learned that no one could deceive the Levitation Tower. With the omnipotent method of the Fostering race, it would be very easy to tell whether one was lying or not.</p>

  <p>He knew that his companions might also have the same hesitations, so he repeatedly reminded them to answer the questions with all honesty.</p>
