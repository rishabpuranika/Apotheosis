  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even after spending so much time and energy, the two warriors got nothing. It was such a big blow!</p>

  <p>Their expressions were deranged, and they were unable to control themselves.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a shallow layer of white mist appeared on the huge rock, floating in the air.</p>

  <p>At first, the layer of white mist was very light, almost invisible to the naked eye. The two of them were sitting on the ground, venting their feelings, and they didn't notice it.</p>

  <p>The white mist became thicker and was more conspicuous.</p>

  <p>Landry was lying on the ground, looking at the sky as his miserable laughter resounded in the air. Damian, however, was staring at the rock.</p>

  <p>His crazy smile froze on his face, and a stunned expression filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>Landry sensed that something was amiss when he looked at Damian, so he asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Damian surveyed the rock and pointed at the white mist. "What...what the heck is that?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, Landry quivered and suddenly turned around.</p>

  <p>He stared intently at the rock, and suddenly a bright light emitted from his eyes. He was ecstatic now.</p>

  <p>"This...this is... the sword cloud left behind by Supreme Lord Sword!</p>

  <p>This... This is..." Now Landry was so excited that he couldn't even speak clearly anymore.</p>

  <p>Damian was just as thrilled. He was gaping at the sight before him.</p>

  <p>Wisps of the white mist in front of his eyes were slowly floating out from the huge rock. The mist contained water, as the huge rock was damp.</p>

  <p>The mist was condensing very slowly, and it took a while for a thin layer to appear. Landry had deduced that it was a sword cloud, but he could not see its shape right now. He could only wait for the mist to condense.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, naturally wasn't aware of what was happening at the huge rock.</p>

  <p>Except for him and Layla, all the candidates had completed their tests.</p>

  <p>As the old man in cotton clothes had made the arrangements, Zheng and Layla did not have much of a say in it. He called out the last two names, and the two young warriors stepped into the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>A moment later, Zheng stepped into the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Space seemed to be engulfed in a thick fog, as if it was a paradise on earth. The ambiance had an ethereal feel to it.</p>

  <p>In the fog stood many circular stone platforms. There were a total of two hundred stone platforms to accommodate the two hundred warriors who underwent the trial at the same time.</p>

  <p>Zheng was standing on one of the stone platforms. His gaze swept around and then he saw a stone platform not far from him. Despite the thick layer of fog, he was able to see a blurry silhouette on the stone platform.</p>

  <p>The mist continued to swirl around them and gradually dissipated, revealing the figure on the stone platform slowly.</p>

  <p>As there were only two warriors in the Illusion Space, the silhouette had to be none other than Layla.</p>

  <p>When the fog dissipated completely, Zheng found that Layla was smiling at him and a cyan sword was already in her hand.</p>

  <p>The sword exuded a simple and austere aura; it was obvious that it was not an ordinary object!</p>

  <p>Layla liked to collect different hair ornaments, so she often had all kinds of beautiful jewels on her head.</p>

  <p>However, she had removed all her hair ornaments now, and her straight, black hair, which was almost ten feet long, floated in the wind.</p>

  <p>She slowly raised the cyan sword in her hand and yelled, "This time, I will be more focused!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't that she wasn't focused in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, but she hadn't used all of her power. She thought that 28, 000 miles was enough and that no one else could overtake her.</p>

  <p>However, she was proven wrong and she had failed spectacularly. Not only did Zheng easily beat her record, he had even gone on to set an unbreakable record.</p>

  <p>This time, she wouldn't give him the chance.</p>

  <p>The old man had purposely arranged for Zheng and Layla to be in the same round. Perhaps it was because he saw that Layla did not go all out in the previous battle, or maybe he took Sunset World lord's suggestion.</p>

  <p>There were only the two of them in the Illusion Space. Furthermore, they were in very close proximity to each other. She could keep an eye on Zheng's progress at all times. This time, she was determined not to underestimate him or give him any leeway.</p>

  <p>"You two may begin!" The old man's voice came from outside the Illusion Space. "You will be able to start the trial after stepping on the disc below your feet."</p>

  <p>Outside the Illusion Space, the Sunset World lord, the palace leaders, the vice palace leaders, and the warriors who had finished their trials were staring at the two people on the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down at the platform. There were many discs in the middle of the platform. Each of the discs had a number written on it. Right now, the disk before Zheng's feet had the word "One" written on it. Evidently, stepping on this disk would signal the start of the first round of the trial.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng took a step forward and stepped onto the disk.</p>

  <p>When Layla saw this, the corners of her mouth lifted. She turned her head, and her shockingly long black hair flowed behind her like a satin ribbon painted by an artist. She, too, gently tapped the first disk with her foot.</p>

  <p>The first round of trial in the Illusion Space had commenced.</p>

  <p>A circle of soldiers, wearing heavy armors and robust helmets, appeared on the stone platform.</p>

  <p>Zheng was indifferent to the presence of this small army. He took out the Thunder Wind Divine Sword and did not use its special capability.</p>

  <p>Instead, when the soldiers approached him, he swung his sword horizontally, slashing his enemies one after another. As the light from the sword flashed, the soldiers were instantly sliced to pieces.</p>

  <p>After Zheng killed the group of soldiers, another group appeared around him. The moment his figure moved, the soldiers turned into fragments once again.</p>

  <p>After three consecutive waves of attacks, the first round of the trial was over.</p>

  <p>It played out rather quickly. From start to end, it only took about thirty seconds. But when Zheng passed the first round and looked to the right, he saw Layla's long hair laid on the platform. She tilted her head and looked at him. It seemed that she had passed the first round before him.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled slightly and stepped on to the disc with the word "Two" as he initiated the second round.</p>

  <p>The first few rounds of the trial were relatively simple. Even the weakest warriors of the thirteen palaces were able to pass the sixth round, and only a few warriors were eliminated in the seventh round.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng did not hesitate. In the second round, his speed increased a little. The long sword in his hand swiftly destroyed the white-robed warriors who were advancing on him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Compared to the first round of soldiers, these warriors were slightly stronger. But Zheng was able to take care of them without much trouble.</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds later, Zheng passed the second round.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng found that Layla was still standing where she was, with her long hair spread out on the platform. She was staring at him with a proud smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng was astonished. He had thought that passing the second round in thirty seconds was fast enough. He hadn't expected that Layla to be faster than him in this round too.</p>

  <p>She mocked him, "You're really slow."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged and turned around to step on the third disk.</p>

  <p>This time, a group of bronze-armored warriors appeared on the platform.</p>

  <p>But Zheng wasn't in a hurry to fight the bronze-armored warriors. Instead, he locked his gaze onto Layla. He wanted to see how she was able to achieve that mind-blowing speed.</p>

  <p>Layla had activated the third round. The moment the bronze-armored warriors appeared, she gently raised her sword. When she noticed Zheng's gaze, she smiled sweetly, and her cyan sword vibrated. All the warriors shook violently, and almost instantly their armors exploded. All the warriors vanished.</p>

  <p>"Wow! That is truly amazing!" Zheng exclaimed. He was stunned and was not sure how she did it. No wonder she was able to pass the trials so quickly!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the warriors on his platform had already surrounded him. He was jolted back to the situation on hand and began to deal with them.</p>
