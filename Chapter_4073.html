</p>

  <p>"It seems this giant elephant's obsession was triggered by humans,"</p>

  <p>Bacchus remarked as he stared at the giant elephant in the cell.</p>

  <p>The erstwhile gentle giant had transformed completely into a killing machine, raging at the prison bars wildly.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the prison was made of a special material. The thick bars remained steadfast even after relentlessly being struck by the massive creature.</p>

  <p>"By us? What do you mean?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"It's possible that humans killed the giant elephant, but it had forgotten this, so it wasn't beset with hatred just a while ago. It appears it has been awakened upon seeing you, turning it into a killing type instantly," said Bacchus.</p>

  <p>"Humans killed it?" The Snake Goddess thought for a moment and then shook her head. "The Ghost Mountain must have come into being much earlier than the human race, unless..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tilted her head to look at Campbell.</p>

  <p>There were almost no differences between a human being and a human spirit. It was likely that the giant elephant's obsession was triggered by human spirits.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm wondering if all the resentment-level Treacherous Beings are like this," Fuxi said worriedly.</p>

  <p>He had come to the Ghost Mountain because he had wanted to fuse with a powerful Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>But if all the Treacherous Beings wanted to kill humans, then that would be impossible.</p>

  <p>This obviously also weighed heavily on everyone's mind. "We can test it.</p>

  <p>I'm not a human. Let me try touching them," Pearson offered.</p>

  <p>"Good idea," Luo Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Goddess suddenly whipped around. "It's not the right time, though."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed her gaze and saw about six small eyeballs floating up to the entrance of the second floor. As soon as they spotted Luo Zheng and the others, they started speeding toward them.</p>

  <p>"Right. Hold that thought," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Run!" Thurston shouted.</p>

  <p>No one needed to be told twice. The group began to run.</p>

  <p>The second floor of the Ghost Mountain was quite spacious.</p>

  <p>The first floor was at the bottom of the Ghost Mountain, and it was larger than the second floor. More than a hundred thousand kinds of Treacherous Beings were imprisoned on the first floor, and there were over a hundred of each kind.</p>

  <p>On the second floor, there were only a few thousand resentment-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>A few thousand huge prison cells were distributed equidistantly on the second floor, and the passageways separated by the prisons extended in all directions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone knew the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization, so no one dared face the eyeballs head on.</p>

  <p>As they ran, they constantly changed directions, trying to lose the flying eyeballs.</p>

  <p>However, the small eyeballs were not only very flexible but also extremely fast.</p>

  <p>They moved as fast as Luo Zheng and the others, and there seemed to be no way they could outrun them.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers, swallow those eyeballs!" Bacchus ordered the Glede Demon race.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had already drawn the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race over to their side. The Glede Demon race was thus on the same boat with these humans, so they, too, needed to escape this.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons stopped sprinting. They flapped their wings in the opposite direction. Their speed quickly dropped before they sped straight toward the eyeballs.</p>

  <p>They pecked the eyeballs fiercely with their beaks before swallowing them whole.</p>

  <p>"Did they do it? Squeak!" King Ieuan was too apprehensive to look back.</p>

  <p>"Those eyeballs used for detecting shouldn't be that difficult to deal with..."</p>

  <p>But before Bacchus could finish, the necks of the Glede Demons who had swallowed the eyeballs suddenly twisted, their bodies contorting out of shape.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Blood spurted from the broken necks of the Glede Demons. The eyeballs sped back out.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Bacchus was so outraged that he couldn't speak. He had personally chosen those soldiers because they were the elites of his race, but they were killed so easily!</p>

  <p>When Fuxi and the others saw what the eyeballs were capable of, their faces darkened.</p>

  <p>It was never a good thing to be targeted by the Eye Spirit, and it seemed these small eyeballs were just as ruthless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched as the eyeballs sped toward them again, trailing after the last person in the team. An idea flashed in his mind then. "Everyone, stop!"</p>

  <p>"Stop? Why?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Just do as I say!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng barked out.</p>

  <p>Although everyone was bewildered by it, they still did as Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The six small eyeballs were floating not too far away from them. They stared at the group menacingly.</p>

  <p>"These eyeballs are acting according to the orders of the Eye Spirit. If you were the Eye Spirit, what would you do after releasing these eyeballs?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Order them to find the target, follow it, and deliver back what they see," the Snake Goddess replied.</p>

  <p>"Right." Luo Zheng nodded. "But the eyeballs wouldn't be able to directly relay what they see to the Eye Spirit. He can only see the necklace with ten wolf teeth."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, everyone immediately got into thinking.</p>

  <p>Spiritual sense couldn't be used on the Night View Island, so it wasn't possible that these eyeballs were being controlled remotely. They were then likely only mechanically executing prior orders of the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>"So these eyeballs could be lured away?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>"We can give it a try."</p>

  <p>Pearson walked straight to the end of the team.</p>

  <p>As expected, the small eyeballs diverted their full attention on him.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Pearson quickly took out a huge Grass Bull from his spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>The Grass Bull was asleep. Pearson reached out his hand and slapped it on the buttocks. Startled awake, the creature let out a moo and scampered away.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The small eyeballs followed it, quickly leaving the group alone.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan breathed a sigh of relief. "Squeak! It's a good thing the spiritual sense can't be used here, then."</p>

  <p>Danger averted, the group continued walking through the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the first floor, the Eye Spirit was left suffering because of the ring-shaped pattern of the ten wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>This endeavor was causing him intense pain.</p>

  <p>The problem was that he had released over a hundred eyeballs.</p>

  <p>But when he tried to communicate with them, he found that all of them were out of contact.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred patterns of wolf teeth surfaced continuously, and the Eye Spirit endured over a hundred times of pain.</p>

  <p>This was causing their side much delay.</p>

  <p>"Can't you communicate with the eyeballs?" Claire asked.</p>

  <p>Pain flashed in the Eye Spirit's eyes. "No, I can't. And the Ten Teeth Necklace is really punishing me."</p>

  <p>Claire didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>She knew that the Ten Teeth Necklace was the Monkey Spirit King's obsession, and the Eye Spirit was unable to put up any resistance.</p>

  <p>"There is only one path through the Ghost Mountain. Let's just go straight to the Ghost Altar at the deepest part on the second floor. We will definitely be able to find them there," Tate suggested.</p>

  <p>He knew that Bacchus would be with Luo Zheng and the others. With the Element Spirit Civilization now on his side, however, he might be able to kill them all this time.</p>

  <p>"Right. They're probably heading to the Ghost Altar," Murdock echoed.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. Lead the way," the Eye Spirit hissed amid the pain.</p>
