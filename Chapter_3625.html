<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples the man was talking to were all from the Land of Sword Grief, meaning they had all reached the Chaotic Source Realm. Even those from the first floor could be considered powerful masters in the Source World.</p>

  <p>There was no way they were going to tolerate this man's insult.</p>

  <p>Raising his eyebrows, a disciple on the second floor called out, "Sir, you might be a Oneness General, but it is very rude of you to say we are 'useless'."</p>

  <p>"Like every one of us, you yourself must've come from the Land of Sword Grief. Are you useless too?" a disciple on the first floor retorted haughtily.</p>

  <p>Oneness Generals were put in charge of the Oneness Guards, so they were considered the commanders of the Oneness Sky Palace's army.</p>

  <p>The status of these Oneness Generals was one level lower than that of the Oneness Governors. In fact, a few disciples on the second floor of the Land of Sword Grief were training in the army. Once they'd gained enough experience, they'd be considered for the title of Oneness General.</p>

  <p>Although Oneness Generals were known to be extraordinarily strong, there was no way the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were going to back down from his insult.</p>

  <p>Chaos erupted among the disciples as they indignantly tried to defend their honors. However, the man remained calm. "You," he suddenly said, a crafty smile creeping onto his face. "You, you, you... And you."</p>

  <p>Lastly, he pointed at Zheng. Each time he pointed at someone, their golden swords would suddenly glow. The same went for Zheng.</p>

  <p>The situation in the North Unicorn Province was extremely critical, so they sorely needed skilled fighters.</p>

  <p>Upon catching word that the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had come, many of the Oneness Generals had returned to the North Mysterious City. According to the rules made by the leaders, each of them could choose five assistants.</p>

  <p>The man with a crew cut was Sinclair Su, and he was the first Oneness General to arrive at the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>Sinclair was no stranger to the battlefield. He knew it was bloody and cruel.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he knew he wanted to choose disciples with a calm mind.</p>

  <p>This would explain why, the moment he showed up, he riled the disciples.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see which ones responded calmly.</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng and the other four disciples Sinclair had chosen had remained stoic in the face of being insulted. In Sinclair's eyes, these were the ones most fit to be his assistants.</p>

  <p>Initially, he had chosen the Evil God. Sinclair could immediately sense the unbelievable power emanating from him. However, once they locked eyes, Sinclair had felt his heartbeat quicken. Trusting his gut, he instinctively decided against recruiting the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You five, come with me. As for the others, I'm so sorry for having offended you!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair bowed with his hands clasped, apologizing sincerely.</p>

  <p>The disciples weren't stupid. In an instant, they caught on to what Sinclair was up to. Some of them rolled their eyes, while others smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>These Oneness Generals of the Oneness Guards were too cunning!</p>

  <p>As Zheng stood up to follow Sinclair, he shot a glance at the Evil God. Using his consciousness, he spoke to him secretly, "If someone chooses you, try your best to assist them. In the face of danger, however, prioritize getting out of there alive."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Creator." The Evil God nodded meekly.</p>

  <p>Not long after Zheng and the other four left with Sinclair, two more Oneness Generals arrived at the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Similar to Sinclair's approach, they tried to infuriate the disciples.</p>

  <p>The disciples looked at the Oneness Generals exasperatedly. As if they were going to fall for the same trick again!</p>

  <p>However, the Oneness Generals were unfazed. With a shrug, they continued picking their assistants. More and more Oneness Generals arrived, each selecting assistants among the disciples.</p>

  <p>Most of the Oneness Generals were ferocious and resolute, but for some reason, no one dared choose the Evil God. After a while, the Evil God found himself sitting in the pavilion, alone.</p>

  <p>The North Unicorn Province was shrouded in smoke all year round.</p>

  <p>After leaving the North Mysterious City, Zheng and the other four disciples followed Sinclair all the way north.</p>

  <p>"The Sun Crow race has taken over the Grand River Fortress, and a million people have died." Sinclair narrowed his eyes as he brought them up to speed. "The Oneness Guards have also suffered thirty thousand casualties, and more than thirty Oneness Generals have died."</p>

  <p>The total number of the Oneness Guards was only eighty thousand. At this point, they had lost more than a third of that. Moreover, there were only two hundred Oneness Generals in total, and more than thirty of them had died.</p>

  <p>Suffering such a loss was indeed too heavy a burden for the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"It was easy to defend the Grand River Fortress, but difficult to attack," a fair-skinned scholar-like disciple suddenly chirped from behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, there were transmission arrays inside. Even if the enemy had managed to break in, the people inside should have been able to retreat without suffering any losses."</p>

  <p>The fair-skinned scholar-like disciple was Guzman, and he ranked thirty-third on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Before Sinclair could answer, Zheng asked, "Was the Cage of Heaven and Earth used?"</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province, he had witnessed the Cage of Heaven and Earth in action. The cage could cover an entire province, and no one could use Grand Teleportation to get in or out.</p>

  <p>Sinclair nodded. "Yes, the Cage of Heaven and Earth was used."</p>

  <p>"Even Oneness Generals couldn't break free from the cage?" Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, Elizabeth had the power to break free from the Cage of Heaven and Earth and was able to use Grand Teleportation. The Oneness Generals shouldn't be much weaker than her.</p>

  <p>Sinclair sighed, "If the Cage of Heaven and Earth were to envelop the entire province, it wouldn't be able to trap us, but under the surprise attack of the Sun Crows led by Emperor Charm, we humans were forced to retreat to the Grand River Fortress. The power of the cage was only aimed at the fortress, so we couldn't get rid of it."</p>

  <p>At that time, Sinclair had also been in the Grand River Fortress. Under the leadership of the other elders, he had fought and then retreated. It was lucky enough that he managed to escape.</p>

  <p>However, his younger brother, who was also a Oneness General, wasn't so fortunate. He had died in the Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>As Sinclair recounted this, Zheng noticed a hint of sadness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>After occupying several big provinces, the Sun Crows had finally stopped in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>Now the task of the Oneness Guards was to stop the Sun Crows at all costs in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>"From the North Mysterious City to the northwest, seven arrays and twelve passes have been set up. I'm responsible for guarding the Mountain Sea Pass, which is the most dangerous one." That sly smile crept on his face once more. "You must be careful when we get there."</p>

  <p>The disciples exchanged wary glances upon hearing Sinclair's last few words.</p>

  <p>The situation was already very dangerous, yet they had to guard the most dangerous area of all. Such bad luck!</p>

  <p>Sinclair seemed to sense what was going on in their heads. "Don't worry," he said in an attempt to comfort them. "The Mountain Sea Pass might be the most dangerous, but it's also the most heavily guarded. Even if the Sun Crows manage to invade the Mountain Sea Pass, the others will come to our aid."</p>

  <p>Guzman nodded. "The North Unicorn Province is the last pass of the Oneness Sky Palace. The Oneness Sky Palace will definitely block the Sun Crows here. Many elders from the seven mountains have also come. We shouldn't be pessimistic."</p>

  <p>"Right. The elders of the seven mountains are in charge of the seven arrays.</p>

  <p>Not far behind the Mountain Sea Pass is the Vastness Array, which is defended by the strongest warriors of the Vastness Mountain," added Sinclair confidently.</p>

  <p>"The Vastness Mountain?"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows at the mention of this name.</p>
