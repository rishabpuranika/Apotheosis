<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite Luo Zheng's extensive comprehension of space, his attempts to enter the void still proved futile.</p>

  <p>Logan was quick to attack and also quick to disappear. Although Luo Luo Zheng could vaguely feel Logan's presence, he could only clearly pinpoint his location just before he attacked. Luo Luo Zheng was more or less a sitting duck.</p>

  <p>But not for long. Luo Luo Zheng had already mapped out a strategy in his head.</p>

  <p>Since he could only locate Logan in that split second before he attacked, Luo Luo Zheng steeled himself and waited for his strike.</p>

  <p>Three, four, maybe five seconds later, Luo Luo Zheng felt a prickling sensation on his neck and he quickly determined Logan's exact position. Not wasting this opportunity, Luo Luo Zheng deflected his opponent's strike and pushed him back into the void. However, he didn't allow Logan to go in alone. Luo Luo Zheng also slipped through the space crack and followed his opponent inside.</p>

  <p>This was when Logan realized that he had been too careless. He thought that his sudden, unpredictable attacks would've been enough to weaken Luo Luo Zheng but the young man was actually smart and saw through his strategy.</p>

  <p>He had opened the space crack a bit too big and had let Luo Luo Zheng in.</p>

  <p>The two vanished into thin air, greatly confusing the spectators back on the square. Where did the two fighters go? They stared at the sky blankly, not knowing where to find them.</p>

  <p>It was only the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters and a few of the Life and Death Realm warriors that kept gazing at the sky as if the fight hadn't taken a strange turn at all.</p>

  <p>To see through the void, a warrior would need to develop his or her own special skill. Turner, for example, had eyes that shone with golden light that enabled him to see through everything.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York had eyes of the darkest night that let him do the same thing.</p>

  <p>Others turned to their magical items. One of the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters, for example, placed a transparent crystal in front of his eyes in order to watch the battle now happening in the void.</p>

  <p>The two warriors were currently engaged in a heated fight in the void.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's entry into the void made Logan lose his composure, but only for a moment. The fact remained that this was still his territory, so with a loud battle cry, he lifted his Space Chopping Sword and brought it down upon his opponent.</p>

  <p>An ordinary sacred weapon would stand no chance against the Space Chopping Sword. It was a good thing that Luo Zheng's sword was a top-grade sacred weapon that could go head-to-head with Logan's Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>As the two fought, Logan's handicap soon became apparent.</p>

  <p>The martial skill he cultivated was simple, but by no means inferior. It focused on agility, strength, and precision. Logan preferred this method due to the fact that he wanted to achieve the best results using the most powerful swordsmanship technique in the shortest amount of time.</p>

  <p>It was similar to the minimalist approach Luo Luo Zheng also pursued with his own methods.</p>

  <p>However, the 'No Move' that Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended actually worked best against Logan's simple swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's 'No Move' could only be beaten in two ways. First was to completely ignore Luo Zheng's move and directly suppress him with brute, physical strength.</p>

  <p>The second was to simply grasp an even more ingenious move. Of course, there might be some mighty powerful martial artist who could achieve that. Such person couldn't be found in the Lower World and it surely wasn't Logan.</p>

  <p>'My swordsmanship is completely at a disadvantage, '</p>

  <p>Logan thought, his strikes now becoming sloppy because of his desperation.</p>

  <p>Logan was a proud man. He was someone who came from nothing but, through relying on his diligence and talent, was able to rise and become an outstanding warrior. He was now at the first tier among the warriors in the younger generation of the York Divine Kingdom so his helplessness right now really got to him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, his swordsmanship method was the secret sect's secret inheritance that had been passed down from the Upper World. To have Luo Luo Zheng easily break through it really dealt a heavy blow to his confidence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strike was akin to the Incantation of the Golden Hoop: a pressure tightly bound his limbs and prevented him from fully executing his best moves.</p>

  <p>What was more frustrating was how simple Luo Zheng's technique was. Every time Logan came at him with the Space Chopping Sword, Luo Luo Zheng simply lifted his sword and casually deflected the blow. His movement was gentle and his face was calm while Logan became even more irate at what was happening.</p>

  <p>Not able to hold it back any longer, Logan eventually snapped, "Break it!</p>

  <p>Space Chopping Sword, Chaotic Space Slash!"</p>

  <p>He clenched his teeth as hundreds of sword shadows burst forth from his Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>Logan's now dark red eyes and ominous sword still did not deter Luo Luo Zheng who casually flicked his sword to strike.</p>

  <p>"Chink!"</p>

  <p>After comprehending the No Move, Luo Luo Zheng could see through most of the swordsmanship. He knew Logan had already exhausted his Space Chopping Sword to its limit. It was over for him.</p>

  <p>The casual strike collided with the Space Chopping Sword. For a split second, Logan met Luo Zheng's eyes and was stunned with the smile he gave him. Then, an irresistible force began to pour out from Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>As the powerful force instantly surged out, Logan almost couldn't hold the sword in his hand. If it wasn't for the fact that the Space Chopping Sword was condensed by him through the Space Law and had already become a part of him, it would've already flown out of his grip from the sheer amount of power that surged out from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no trouble getting closer to Logan. He still managed to deflect Logan's sword and made it possible for him to reach Logan.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was at an arm's length, Luo Luo Zheng threw a punch at his opponent's chest.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch was not enough to break through the space armor, so Logan got unharmed. Nevertheless, Logan was still sent flying back a few feet by the force of the attack.</p>

  <p>'It's still not enough?' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>His eyes lit up as his body flashed and chased after Logan who was quickly retreating.</p>

  <p>In a burst of panic, Logan turned and immediately thrust at his pursuer but Luo Luo Zheng simply deflected his Space Chopping Sword just like he did multiple times earlier.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng once again got close enough to land another punch on the space armor. This time, his strike contained the power of three hundred dragon scales which effectively left a network of spider cracks on the space armor.</p>

  <p>'Not only is his swordsmanship incomparable, he even possesses such strong power. Is he a monster?' Logan couldn't help but think to himself.</p>

  <p>There was fear in his heart and it wasn't a feeling that he was used to. In the younger generation, besides the royal members of the four divine kingdoms, there was also one other person who he thought was a monster and that was a warrior from the Nine Furnace Martial House.</p>

  <p>However, that was before. Now that he had faced Luo Luo Zheng, Logan now knew what the true definition of a monster was.</p>

  <p>That Nine Furnace Martial House warrior was powerful but he had a weakness. Luo Luo Zheng on the other hand, seemed to have no weakness. There was just no point denying it. His soul was strong, his swordsmanship was exquisite, and his strength could flatten down a thousand mountains, perhaps more. If it wasn't for his space armor, Logan wouldn't have withstood even a single punch from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm not his match?' he finally admitted to himself despite his pride.</p>

  <p>A strong wind howled upon the banks of the West Dragon River. If one was not careful, the wind could effectively push them towards the river's depths, ultimately sending them to their deaths.</p>

  <p>The warriors present here were at least at Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>They all stood still and patiently waited for the outcome of Luo Luo Zheng and Logan's battle.</p>

  <p>The powerful Soul Sea Realm masters already knew the outcome but those in the square were still clueless with the events that had transpired within the void.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who's got the upper hand? Will Tianxing make it through?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he can win?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it too!"</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the Harlen Divine Kingdom could only place their hopes upon Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors of the York Divine Kingdom could only laugh at their wishes.</p>

  <p>"These warriors are too naive! Logan has comprehended the third layer of Space Law. He is invincible! How could Tianxing ever win this? What a joke!"</p>

  <p>"Logan possesses the strength to fight a Life and Death Realm master.</p>

  <p>Tianxing is only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm so there's no way he'd win.</p>

  <p>These people are delusional!"</p>

  <p>"Just let them be. Reality is cruel. Once Logan emerges as the victor, they'd wake up from their delusions."</p>

  <p>Those from the York Divine Kingdom were at ease given the terrifying display of strength Logan had already shown everyone earlier.</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone suddenly felt a wave of energy coming from the sky. It was so strong that almost everyone immediately felt it.</p>

  <p>"They are out!"</p>

  <p>Everyone witnessed how a strange crack appeared in the air as a figure staggered out, evidently injured from the fight.</p>

  <p>"The battle's over. Looks like Tianxing isn't a match for Lo?"</p>

  <p>Before the York Divine Kingdom warrior could finish his sentence he realized that the miserable figure that had come out was none other than Logan!</p>

  <p>"Logan? He looks horrible!"</p>

  <p>The sight shocked the warriors of the York Divine Kingdom to the core.</p>

  <p>"It's obvious he suffered a lot under Tianxing's hands," a warrior with sharp eyes said, shaking his head.</p>
