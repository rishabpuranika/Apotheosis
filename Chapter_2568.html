<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a stranger to this world.</p>

  <p>He had learned most of what he knew about the Wild Gods from Zelda, as well as the method of absorbing the wild bones and extracting the Wild God Power. Moreover, he also knew about the blood wild bones in the Sand Core City.</p>

  <p>However, he did not yet have a complete understanding of these things.</p>

  <p>He only knew that he could increase his strength by devouring the wild bones and absorbing the Wild God Power therein.</p>

  <p>If someone possessed the blood of a certain race, they could then exclusively absorb the blood wild bones of that race and obtain the talents contained within that blood.</p>

  <p>That was the sum of Luo Zheng's knowledge on the matter.</p>

  <p>"I just started to cultivate the Wild God system. As for the Body Tribulations that must be faced, I really don't know anything about them," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Giacomo gazed at Luo Zheng for a long while and then his surprise gave way to a smile. "The Wild God system is not merely about body refining. If you practice in the extreme, you would be able to cross the shore and reach the Other Shore Realm. Actually, the Wild God system is also known as the Ancient God Cultivation Method."</p>

  <p>"I can reach the Other Shore Realm through intense cultivation of the Wild God system?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed at the promise.</p>

  <p>Giacomo nodded. "Grand Elder instructed us in this."</p>

  <p>Those powerful exiles had been forced to this world by the Chaos Ancient God. At the very beginning, they couldn't live for a thousand years. Whenever the Light of Adjudication came, the prisoners kept in the prison would be purified and emptied.</p>

  <p>But after the bone towers appeared, the exiles found a way to survive, and they began to form their own races.</p>

  <p>Gradually, this empty world had become lively, and the races had proliferated in their diversity.</p>

  <p>At first, the exiles were inclined to encourage their clansmen to cultivate the True God system, but soon they discovered that this world wasn't suitable for cultivating this system.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the exiles to extract life vitality from the chaotic energy, but for the warriors who had just started to practice, it proved extremely difficult, despite the fact that they were born as extraordinary creatures and were able to survive at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The strong warriors who had been exiled to this world by the Chaos Ancient God had not been weaklings in the Source World. The discovery was quickly made that there was a massive amount of wild bones here.</p>

  <p>The origin of these wild bones could even have dated back to the early stage of chaos, and the sheer number of these wild bones was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>So these exiles thought of the body refining cultivation method that was passed down from ancient times, namely the Ancient God Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>"Why don't the warriors in the Source World practice this cultivation method?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Almost all the warriors that Luo Zheng had come into contact with were cultivating the True God system.</p>

  <p>It seemed that even Harper had successfully cultivated the True God system and had therefore reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's question stumped Giacomo, who was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>Giacomo was born in this world. He was not from the Source World.</p>

  <p>These things had come down through a very long history, so it was naturally difficult for him to explain this in laymen's terms.</p>

  <p>"There are no such cultivation resources in the Source World, so those warriors can only choose the Grand World Cultivation Method instead of the Ancient God Cultivation Method," an ancient voice suddenly said behind them.</p>

  <p>Hearing the wizened voice, Luo Zheng and Giacomo both turned their heads and saw that the oldest man had appeared behind them.</p>

  <p>Giacomo was about to bow respectfully when he saw the oldest man.</p>

  <p>The oldest man waved his hand and said, "Don't bother with the niceties.</p>

  <p>I'm here to see Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"The Grand World Cultivation Method you said is the method to cultivate the True God system?" Luo Zheng asked, still puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right," the oldest man replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered over this for a while, and a strange expression settled on his face. "Does that then mean that the ancient gods also needed to cultivate with the wild bones? In other words, the Source World used to also contain a huge amount of wild bones then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're quite correct," the oldest man said, pleased at Luo Zheng's agile mind.</p>

  <p>"After absorbing all of the wild bones in the Source World, those warriors then became the ancient gods. The newcomers didn't have the wild bones as cultivation sources. As a result, they ended up creating the Grand World Cultivation Method, namely the True God system. Am I right?" Luo Zheng asked, carefully expressing his train of thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're absolutely correct!" the oldest man exclaimed. "You're so smart to have understood that. You're indeed the grandson of the Grand Chieftain."</p>

  <p>The oldest man sighed slightly and then added, "There was once a land of wilderness in the Source World. Like this world, there were also huge amounts of wild bones there, but all of them had been dug up and claimed."</p>

  <p>Although the oldest man repeatedly confirmed what he had suspected, Luo Zheng's expression became more and more guarded. He then asked another question, "Where do the countless wild bones in the Source World and this world originally come from?"</p>

  <p>"I knew you would ask this question." The oldest man had already expected it, so he replied lightly, "That involves the Chaos Ancient Gods, and that is also the ultimate question of the whole chaos. There are some talents that never show up among the populations in the Source World, and they have been seeking the answers to this question for countless years."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly. He had not expected that his casual question would have led to the divulging of such complicated things.</p>

  <p>"The behavior of the Chaos Ancient Gods has always been unpredictable, especially that of Herbert. He was the one who built the prison and was said to be incomparably powerful, but every time he descended, he would bring about some unimaginable events. Sometimes he would surprise the warriors, and sometimes he would scare them."</p>

  <p>The oldest man sighed and continued, "The bones are said to be our backups. Our bones may be hidden somewhere in this world."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked his eyes as an incomprehensible look settled on his face.</p>

  <p>This was too much for a mere warrior to understand, and all that he could comprehend was that the Chaos Ancient God who had built the prison was called Herbert.</p>

  <p>Giacomo, who stood next to Luo Zheng, was also completely stunned by these revelations.</p>

  <p>"Our backups?" Luo Zheng asked in bewilderment as the implications of this information struggled through his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The oldest man nodded. "Yes, each Wight corresponds to a living creature within the chaos. Once a Wight dies, there will be one more skeleton added to the Immemorial Wilderness. However, these Wights are only our backups. It's impossible for you to know exactly which Wight is your backup."</p>

  <p>"Then why did Herbert do all of this?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go ask him?" the oldest man suggested with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but smile. These questions were truly not what he had expected from this conversation.</p>

  <p>The oldest man looked around the warehouses and said, "It's extremely painful to cultivate using the Ancient God Cultivation Method. If we accept what was said in the ancient times, we can use our body strength to pass through the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore Realm, but no one living has succeeded in this world. Even in the Source World, other than the ancient gods, no one has ever succeeded. If you are willing to explore this method, then we, the Nine Li race, will do everything in our power to help you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with insight when he heard the oldest man's words.</p>

  <p>Currently, he lacked the strength for this task.</p>

  <p>No matter how his father had planned his own growth in the past, Luo Zheng might not be able to take what would happen to him into consideration now. After all, he had met with too many accidents once he had stepped into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Now an accident had again caused him to be sent to this world by his mother. Still, he would follow this path laid before him without hesitation.</p>
