<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4066 The One Who Rang The Bell </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>There were six great caves lying five thousand feet below the ground of the Jade Pure Realm's northwest side.</p>

  <p>Each cave was about three thousand feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>Each cave's outer layer was covered with meat in the state of constant shrinking, which made the entire cave look like a beating heart.</p>

  <p>While the cave was merely three thousand feet high, the inner space was far larger than this.</p>

  <p>Each and every cave had its own world.</p>

  <p>In the lowest cave stood the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>At the very bottom of the tower was a man holding a bronze mirror in the shape of Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>He was clad in a cyan robe and looked rather wise and remarkable. His aura was impressive.</p>

  <p>"What a sharp insight!</p>

  <p>The channel has been broken!</p>

  <p>This person's control over the Source World has risen to a new level..."</p>

  <p>Grabbing the bronze mirror, he flew up to the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>Carved on the surface at the top were densely packed scriptures, all of which were written in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>"Cutting and sharpening..." the immortal-like old man muttered on top of the tower.</p>

  <p>Each time he chanted, a circle of golden light spread out from his body.</p>

  <p>The golden light swept right past the scriptures, making them rotate chaotically. An extremely solemn aura was emitted, making the old man's aura grow noble and grand.</p>

  <p>Anyone who faced the suppression of the golden light couldn't help but fall to their knees.</p>

  <p>But once the young man was swept by the light, he merely frowned and shouted, "Old man, the channel you've built so painstakingly has been destroyed! You deceived me again. Didn't you tell me that the channel wouldn't ever be discovered?"</p>

  <p>Then, he threw the bronze mirror right in front of the other man.</p>

  <p>The latter merely continued muttering.</p>

  <p>And the golden light continued circling the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Before such a solemn scene, the young man's behavior seemed rather inappropriate.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, the old man's eyes shot open.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The golden light completely dissipated, and the Sanskrit words stopped circling as well, returning to their original form.</p>

  <p>Hearing that the channel had been destroyed, the old man showed no sign of discontent on his face. Instead, he smiled and said, "As I expected, the young man wouldn't die under the Maximized Energy. You know, this Maximized Energy is..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the young man seemed to find it unbearable and interrupted,</p>

  <p>"The Maximized Energy is produced by using a Divine Dao to maximize the Ways-blending Energy. This kind of energy is absolutely uncontrollable.</p>

  <p>Save for those who don't know, no one would be foolish enough to use the Maximized Energy. But it is the most suitable to use for killing the Evil God!"</p>

  <p>The old man had repeated these words over a hundred times recently.</p>

  <p>Having heard it so many times, the young man could recite each word very clearly.</p>

  <p>The old man merely smiled helplessly? he didn't blame the younger man at all. "It's good that he's not dead. Everything goes according to plan, then.</p>

  <p>He might now find a way to break the barrier..."</p>

  <p>He was referring to the barrier between the Other Shore and the chaos.</p>

  <p>From the moment chaos was built up until this point, no one had ever managed to break that barrier.</p>

  <p>Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire chose to come to the Source World by descending.</p>

  <p>In terms of form and strength, they'd be highly restricted.</p>

  <p>"Can that guy really do it?" the young man questioned skeptically.</p>

  <p>After all, the Other Shore was by no means a small nor simple world. It had a particularly special means of connection with the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Yes," affirmed the old man.</p>

  <p>In return, the young man merely curled his lips. It wasn't the first time the old man had talked nonsense, after all. If he was questioned, he'd undoubtedly make up many arguments to reason with the young man. Even if something false slipped out of the old man's mouth, he'd still manage to come up with several remarks.</p>

  <p>But his master had forcefully comprehended a truth back then, resulting in a crack in the barrier. Perhaps, shattering it completely was a possible option.</p>

  <p>Just then, a melodious bell suddenly rang from the inside of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>As it rang, a blazing white sword light rushed up from below.</p>

  <p>"Again! Who is tolling the bell?" The young man in the cyan robe revealed a strange expression.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look. It should be a good thing, after all," said the old man with a smile.</p>

  <p>And so the younger man turned to head into the tower.</p>

  <p>From where he stood, he had a panoramic view of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>It had a total of thirty-three floors, all built according to the situation in the stages of Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In the very corner of the first floor was a handful of golden Equinox Sand, the most preliminary Other Shore Token. From there, the stairs spiraled upward, each floor corresponding to a stage of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Form the sixth floor onward, the Other Shore Tokens on each floor were all of the fourth grade and above.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of tokens? the strengthening type, the auxiliary type, the mysterious type, and the descending type.</p>

  <p>"Who is ringing the bell?"</p>

  <p>The young man stared at it, narrowing his eyes until he found a figure to the side of the bell.</p>

  <p>It was a young man in white, carrying a long sword on his back and exuding confidence and arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! It's him again?" The man was rather speechless. "You just knocked the bell last month, didn't you? Can your body really withstand such strain?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, his physical body can withstand it." The old man's voice resounded from above. "Don't underestimate my Grand Drip Technique. It's not inferior to the Land of Bone Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>"Grand Drip Technique..." The young man's face twitched for a while, thinking that the old man's naming skill was growing worse and worse by the day.</p>

  <p>Ringing the bell was no easy task.</p>

  <p>After cultivating the Truth of Divine Dao, one could enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower and take away one Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The weakest Other Shore Token possessed the power of one divine megaton.</p>

  <p>After the warrior made a breakthrough, they could obtain a physical body that carried the Other Shore Token from the higher floor. By then, they could ring the bell once again.</p>

  <p>The more they cultivated, the more difficult it was to strengthen their bodies, making it harder to ring the bell again.</p>

  <p>In the previous month, after the young man who carried a sword on his back rang the bell, he took away the Other Shore Token on the thirtieth floor.</p>

  <p>Again, reaching the thirty-first floor from the thirtieth floor was by no means an easy feat.</p>

  <p>For some, they could spend thousands of years trying to get there but to no avail.</p>

  <p>But only a month later, the man managed to ring the bell again? in just a single month, his physical strength had increased drastically. It was completely astonishing.</p>

  <p>In the Ruin Graveyard</p>

  <p>At the very core of the Divine Bell City lay a huge bronze bell.</p>

  <p>It was considered the Ruin Graveyard's most holy treasure? the object all the creatures there relied on.</p>

  <p>Each warrior who had reached the Other Shore Realm would visit to ring the bell and obtain their token.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>A long ringing resounded across the Divine Bell City.</p>

  <p>The entire place boiled with excitement.</p>

  <p>The sound of the bell belonged to the thirty-first floor. Very few people in the Ruin Graveyard could ever make it.</p>

  <p>Sitting cross-legged under the huge bell, Tianming had already entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, he had to choose the most suitable Other Shore Token before the bell chime stopped.</p>
