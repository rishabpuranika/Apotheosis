  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng disappeared from the stone platform, he felt the ancestry-level bloodline in his body surging once more.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he finally understood the composition of energy in the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>The first time Zheng was teleported in, he didn't feel the power of the space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't mean the power didn't exist. It just meant that, at the time, Zheng wasn't able to understand it.</p>

  <p>Now that the ancestry-level bloodline surged within him, Zheng instantly understood the power of space within the hexagram array. In fact, it was not one, but two kinds of power of space that were combined in such a way that they offset each other.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zheng was once again pressed into a picture. Then, a huge vortex appeared before him.</p>

  <p>"There are two more lines here,"</p>

  <p>Zheng observed as he took a few steps forward.</p>

  <p>He had arrived at the very center of the huge vortex of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Since ancient times till the present, Zheng was the sole being who had entered this place; who else could've left these two lines here?</p>

  <p>Zheng walked forward cautiously, wrought with confusion. The instant he stepped between the two thin lines, they shot upwards until the two lines were floating above the huge vortex. Unwittingly, Zheng had activated a path that stretched above the vortex, extending into the distance.</p>

  <p>Zheng broke free from the plane and climbed to the top of the Eternal Scroll Painting. From there, he saw that the path headed straight to the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. "That is where the fox girl was," he muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, someone who had obtained a bloodline from the Eternal Scroll Painting would return to the Grand Plain Stage through the vortex.</p>

  <p>Now that the Eternal Scroll Painting had been closed, it was impossible for Zheng to return to the Other Shore through that normal way. He had no choice but to come up with another solution.</p>

  <p>Previously, the fox girl had insisted that he take an origin-level bloodline. If he didn't, she would kill him.</p>

  <p>Now that he had managed to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline, he figured the fox girl wouldn't make any attempt to kill him.</p>

  <p>Bearing that in mind, Zheng relaxed a bit. He continued along the path towards the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting with ease.</p>

  <p>The second Zheng stepped foot onto the Eternal Scroll Painting, the brush-wielder sensed his presence and provided the path specifically for him.</p>

  <p>"He's back," the smiling face of the brush-wielder said.</p>

  <p>The fox girl frowned. "So soon? Did he fail?"</p>

  <p>It was definitely not easy to obtain an origin-level bloodline. As a matter of fact, the fox girl had settled into thinking that it'd take Zheng decades, or even a century, before he successfully obtained an origin-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>She had even gone so far as to entertain the thought that Zheng would die there and would never return.</p>

  <p>Only a short time had passed since Zheng left. Naturally, she was suspicious he had returned unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder continued, "Anyway, I've drawn a path to guide him here."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to speak to him face to face?" asked the fox girl, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder was the manager of the passages. He had never personally faced any creature on the Other Shore. Usually, the fox girl handled these sorts of things.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter anymore," the brush-wielder sighed emotionally. Then the crying face continued, "Many rules have been broken. If we continue to abide by the rules, we might as well draw a circle on the ground to serve as a prison for ourselves!"</p>

  <p>With that, the fox girl fell silent.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the brush-wielder seldom showed his face to anyone. It seemed he had placed his hopes on Zheng.</p>

  <p>With ease, Zheng continued along the path that was set for him. The moment he stepped onto the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the fox girl and the brush-wielder appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Since this was the second time he encountered the fox girl, he greeted her politely. As for her crying companion, Zheng didn't have a clue as to who he was. Naturally, he looked at him vigilantly; it seemed this character had something to do with the Eternal Scroll Painting, but Zheng was at a loss as to how exactly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?" the brush-wielder asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded cautiously, cupping his hands politely. "May I know who you are?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the brush-wielder's sullen face beamed happily. It was now a smiling face in front of him. "I am the brush-wielder."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he summoned a huge ink brush in the air.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's eyes landed on the ink brush, his eyes flashed with understanding. "Are the lines in the Eternal Scroll Painting drawn by you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," The brush-wielder replied. "It can also be said that everything here is created by me."</p>

  <p>The Eternal Scroll Painting served as a special passage, thus the brush-wielder served as the master of this special passage.</p>

  <p>"I see..."</p>

  <p>The light suddenly broke in upon not only Zheng but also the human heroes such as the Primeval Lord of Heaven. They were also interested in the constantly emerging lines within the Eternal Scroll Painting. They knew that there should be an invisible existence over the Eternal Scroll Painting, but none of them had ever seen the true appearance of such an existence.</p>

  <p>It could be said that they were slightly in awe to be in the presence of the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"Have you gotten an origin-level bloodline?" the fox girl suddenly cut in.</p>

  <p>She was not the type to waste time. Anxious to find out, she decidedly interrupted their conversation.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "I think I did."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'you think'?" the fox girl asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"I can't pretend to have obtained one if I haven't, right?" Zheng asked, raising a brow mischievously.</p>

  <p>"Then show me!" the fox girl demanded impatiently.</p>

  <p>The only way Zheng could do so was to demonstrate the power of the bloodline he had obtained, which was something he couldn't do in the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Spreading out his hands, Zheng said helplessly, "I'm afraid I can't use it in this form."</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was standing upright in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was still two-dimensional. This hampered his abilities.</p>

  <p>"Then turn into your normal form and let me see," the fox girl ordered.</p>

  <p>Impatient, she wanted to expose his lie as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Thus, the two of them entered a room of hexagram array and returned to their normal forms.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's flawless fair face exuded a cold aura. "You can prove it now."</p>

  <p>Zheng studied her expression. It seemed she was willing to kill him on the spot if he failed to prove her wrong.</p>

  <p>"First of all, there is something you need to know," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"I want to see your bloodline theurgy. Now!" the fox girl said through gritted teeth, obviously running out of patience with every second that passed. She was under the impression he was stalling for time.</p>

  <p>"Behind the four origin-level bloodlines, there is a stronger bloodline, which is called the ancestry-level bloodline," Zheng continued with a mischievous smile. "The ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard is the origin of all bloodlines, and the four origin-level bloodlines also originate from the ancestry-level bloodline."</p>

  <p>The fox girl remained expressionless. Instead, the killing intent in her eyes intensified tenfold. "One last chance, Zheng. Show me your bloodline theurgy right this instant!"</p>

  <p>Just as the fox girl was about to attack Zheng, the astonished voice of the brush-wielder suddenly came from above, "How do you know the ancestry-level bloodline? And the Eternal Divine Courtyard? Were you able to enter that square?"</p>

  <p>Even the fox girl didn't know about the ancestry-level bloodline, nor was she aware of the existence of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. She had been told that there were four origin-level bloodlines at the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words stirred up a storm in the heart of the brush-wielder as he stared at him intently from above.</p>
