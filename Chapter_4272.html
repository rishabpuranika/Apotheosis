  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't hear Geoffrey's shout.</p>

  <p>All his senses within the main world relied on the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. But this core hadn't absorbed this sound, which was why Zheng couldn't hear it.</p>

  <p>Two thin rays of light began to magnetize his shoulders and the other leg, the magnetized energy being quickly absorbed by them.</p>

  <p>It felt to him as if he had been bitten by an invisible monster that would soon gobble him up in a few bites.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's shout exposed he and Ziya's position.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish noticed the two people on the chain of Time Lock. Its huge eyes emitted a ray of blue light that formed a space wall in front of these two people.</p>

  <p>"Break it!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey roared.</p>

  <p>His physical strength had recovered a little, but he was largely in a state of exhaustion. However, he still managed to use all his strength to hit the space wall.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The power of this punch only caused the space wall to shake slightly. All power had left him.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Ziya, staying behind Geoffrey, pulled out the God Lashing Whip and attacked the wall with all his strength.</p>

  <p>The shadows of the golden whip were like raindrops that came crashing down, but the space wall did not budge one bit. The wall was tougher than they had anticipated.</p>

  <p>After a series of futile attacks, Ziya grabbed Geoffrey, intending to jump over the space wall. But the moment he dragged Geoffrey towards the edge, the light in the eyes of the Starry Roc-fish began to flicker, more and more space walls appearing. The space walls closed up, forming a closed space that blocked them.</p>

  <p>Helpless in the face of this blockade, Ziya had no choice but to bring Geoffrey back to the chain.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey continued to shout through the transparent space wall. His heart broke as he watched Zheng's body slowly turn into pure energy.</p>

  <p>Ziya's face darkened. Everything would be over if they were to be trapped here forever.</p>

  <p>The white light dot, which represented the will of the downgrader, suddenly drew a thin line and drilled into the body of the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>The situation had been under control when the downgrader had begun to take control of the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>And since there had been no room for resistance, the Starry Roc-fish had easily submitted itself to the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Once its soul had finally landed and the downgrader had gained complete control of the Starry Roc-fish, he said loudly, "You've done it! You've really done it! I'm surprised.</p>

  <p>I wondered if there was a slim chance.</p>

  <p>But you have really brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff from the Deep Space! Good job!</p>

  <p>However, I have to take back the Heavenly Ring Staff. You've only helped me get it back. I can now defeat you, which saves me a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he began to laugh.</p>

  <p>Ziya's eyes lit up at the mention of the Heavenly Ring Staff and were focused on it.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had run out of energy now, while Ziya's energy level was low.</p>

  <p>The only person who could use the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff was Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had the complete ancestry-level bloodline in his body, which was also why Geoffrey had gone looking for the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>At this, a bold idea came to Ziya's mind.</p>

  <p>He couldn't exert the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff, but could he send it to Zheng?</p>

  <p>Ziya knew it was a fleeting opportunity, given how Zheng's body had become magnetized and was being devoured little by little.</p>

  <p>He reached out and grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff from Geoffrey's hand. Ziya barked an order under Geoffrey's astonished gaze. "Send us there!"</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, the energy in his inner world began to be constantly extracted.</p>

  <p>His inner world had been operating for a long time and had long formed a complete small world.</p>

  <p>Even though the Heavenly Ring Staff had already extracted half his energy, the inner world had still not suffered too much loss. But Ziya was beyond caring now. In addition to the inner world's energy, he also had the energy of the three Other Shore Tokens in the inner world.</p>

  <p>Employing the spatial transference in the Abstruse Energy World consumed a great deal of energy. The remaining half of the energy in Ziya's inner world had been absorbed, and the Other Shore Tokens had also become dim. It was still not enough to feed the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>"Is this distance too long for you?"</p>

  <p>Ziya gritted his teeth and made a move, causing the three Other Shore Tokens in his inner world to start burning.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Although these Other Shore Tokens were not Holy Items, they were, nevertheless, top-level Other Shore Tokens. They were all connected to the top parts of the holy pillars.</p>

  <p>When these Other Shore Tokens began to burn, three chains suddenly shone brightly.</p>

  <p>Burning the Other Shore Tokens was a form of overuse. It could take more energy from the holy pillars in a short period of time, while at the same time, it could lead to a punishment that was worse than death.</p>

  <p>Ziya was saddened when he heard from Geoffrey about the suffering that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had faced. His master and the other human heroes had the same level of awareness. How could he be afraid of death?</p>

  <p>Energy gushed out of the three burning Other Shore Tokens like water at high tide.</p>

  <p>When ordinary people had burned the Other Shore Tokens, there had always been a great movement since the violent energy was difficult to control. But the Heavenly Ring Staff in Ziya's hand could completely absorb the violent energy. Thus, Ziya looked calm.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey finally sensed that something was wrong. "Master Ziya, what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Ziya remained silent. His life force was fading away after he had burned the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>His normally bright eyes dimmed, fatigue quickly overtaking him.</p>

  <p>It was at this time that the blue light began to flash on the surface of the Heavenly Ring Staff, wrapping Ziya and Geoffrey within it. They disappeared from their spots and in the next moment, appeared beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>With the last of his energy, Ziya stuffed the Heavenly Ring Staff into Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>"It all depends on you..."</p>

  <p>Ziya had barely finished speaking when the skin on his face cracked, and the dry muscles began to roll up. His bones withered and shattered, which was a counterattack from the holy pillars.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization transmitted this scene to Zheng, who panicked as he held the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand. He couldn't understand why Ziya would suddenly collapse like this.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Ring Staff had already fallen into Zheng's hands, Zheng couldn't use it at the moment. Neither his spiritual sense nor his voice could be transmitted within the main world.</p>

  <p>Seeing his father stunned as he was, Geoffrey, without caring about the consequences, rushed up and grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff before shouting, "No matter what method you use, please protect us! You can absorb as much energy as you want in my father's body!"</p>

  <p>He didn't know if it would work.</p>

  <p>After all, the Heavenly Ring Staff would only listen to the holder's orders.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey began to worry when the Heavenly Ring Staff began to frantically absorb Zheng's energy at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>With such a high speed of absorption, an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior wouldn't be able to hold on even for about two seconds.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline that Zheng possessed provided him with an endless energy. After the Heavenly Ring Staff had absorbed enough energy, a halo flashed on top of the staff, within which countless hexagons were released, enveloping Zheng and Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>As the hexagonal enchanted barriers spread out, they also cut off the thin light rays of the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>The downgrader, who had already controlled the Starry Roc-fish's body and was speaking slowly, hadn't expected Ziya to hand the Heavenly Ring Staff to Zheng in such a short time. He didn't know what had happened until the enchanted barriers had unfurled completely.</p>
