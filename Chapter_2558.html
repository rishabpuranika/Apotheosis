<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Giacomo and Luo Zheng flew to the top of the roof. Once they landed there, they climbed up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Halfway up, Luo Zheng saw another Chiyou statue with three heads and three pairs of arms.</p>

  <p>Giacomo took a step forward and respectfully bowed to the Chiyou statue. "This is the leader of our Nine Li race. Before you become a member of our race, you have to worship him with sincerity."</p>

  <p>Although Giacomo had managed to smoothly bring Luo Zheng to the bone tower, it was extremely difficult for one to become qualified enough to enter the bone tower.</p>

  <p>The Light of Adjudication, which appeared once every thousand years, could take away anybody's life. Those who knew about it were desperate to enter one of the bone towers because only the bone towers were able to resist the Light of Adjudication. There were even those who were willing to become guards of the Nine Li race's affiliated sects just so that they could enter the race's bone tower.</p>

  <p>After all, entering a bone tower was the only way that could guarantee them a longer life.</p>

  <p>As for going up this staircase and entering the Nine Li race's territory, that was the lifetime dream for many people.</p>

  <p>It meant getting Chiyou's blood, which would open the door to countless possibilities.</p>

  <p>Every member of the Nine Li race had the utmost respect for Chiyou. So before entering the Nine Li race's territory, they would worship the Chiyou statue first.</p>

  <p>Now, Giacomo treated Luo Zheng as a member of the Nine Li race too.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't understand how, Luo Zheng had managed to absorb the energy of the blood wild bone right in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Giacomo's words, he didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>His mother had told him that Chiyou was his maternal grandfather, so he worshipped the statue like Giacomo did.</p>

  <p>Then, the two of them continued on their way up. Soon, a large cave lit up by a raging firelight coming into view.</p>

  <p>The cave was filled with countless huge palaces. This was the real territory of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>About seven people suddenly flew over from the cave.</p>

  <p>The head of the group was tall and strong, and he had a bare torso and messy hair. Before he even landed in front of Luo Zheng and Giacomo, he said,</p>

  <p>"Giacomo, you want to give this boy the blood of our race?"</p>

  <p>At the sight of this man, a touch of displeasure appeared on Giacomo's face. He coldly replied, "Yes. So what? Are you dissatisfied with what I'm going to do, Erik?"</p>

  <p>No matter how united a race was, there were always internal disputes.</p>

  <p>According to the Nine Li race's rules, Chiyou's blood could only be given to ten people every thousand years. Each drop of blood was incomparably precious.</p>

  <p>Not all the members of the Nine Li race had pure Chiyou's blood. Even if one's parents were both members of the Nine Li race, it was possible that they didn't have Chiyou's blood. Therefore, there were always disputes among the Nine Li members over the precious blood.</p>

  <p>Naturally, it was even more difficult for people who were not from the Nine Li race to get Chiyou's blood.</p>

  <p>In the last 997 years, nine people had already gotten Chiyou's blood, which left just one more person who could have that chance. Therefore, all the people in the Nine Li race were trying to win the blood.</p>

  <p>The man with long, disheveled hair was called Erik. His close friend was the leader of Blue Moon Sect, a subsidiary of the Nine Li race. So, for the sake of his friend, he was making every effort to get Chiyou's blood.</p>

  <p>Until recently, he had thought that he could get Chiyou's blood for his friend for sure, but there had been a sudden change in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The deaths of Chandler and Farhann had caused a situation where no one among the young generation's geniuses was able to fight against the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Romeo, who had safely returned to the Nine Li race, had recommended Luo Zheng to the race.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing about Luo Zheng's outstanding performance, the senior leaders of the Nine Li race had decided to test Luo Zheng first. If Luo Zheng was really as strong as Romeo had told them, they would give Chiyou's blood to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Giacomo had been ordered to bring Luo Zheng back, but he hadn't expected that Luo Zheng would already be able to refine the blood wild bone on his own. He didn't know how to proceed, so he had decided to bring Luo Zheng back first.</p>

  <p>However, Erik didn't know about this sudden turn of events. Thinking that Luo Zheng had come to fight for Chiyou's blood, he felt annoyed from the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>"I didn't dare to protest against the decision made by the Grand Elder.</p>

  <p>But I still doubt that he can pass the test." Glancing up and down at Luo Zheng, Erik chuckled. "I can tell that he has cultivated the True God system.</p>

  <p>Those of the wilderness are always so weird."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had absorbed a wild bone with Chiyou's blood, it was too little power for Erik to notice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows slightly furrowed when he heard what Erik said. He didn't appreciate how dismissive and sarcastic Erik was being.</p>

  <p>But before he could reply with a cutting comment of his own, Giacomo smiled coldly and said, "Don't worry. He will pass the test without any problem. I believe Romeo. He is a good boy who never lies. But there is one thing that might disappoint you. Luo Zheng doesn't need to pass the test."</p>

  <p>Erik's face darkened when he heard this. He asked, "What do you mean?</p>

  <p>Grand Elder wants to give the blood to him directly?"</p>

  <p>"Haw haw." Looking at Erik's gloomy expression, Giacomo was secretly thrilled. Intentionally keeping the explanation to himself, he turned around and said to Luo Zheng, "Come with me! I will take you to meet the Grand Elder!"</p>

  <p>Swish! Erik appeared in front of Giacomo and blocked his way. "Tell me! Otherwise, I won't let you leave!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo stared at Erik coldly. "What? Do you want to fight with me?"</p>

  <p>Erik scowled, but he stood firmly in front of Giacomo without any intention of letting them pass.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help smiling. 'Giacomo is so naughty! Why didn't he just tell Erik the truth?'</p>

  <p>While these two people stood off against each there, a figure floated over. "Giacomo, no matter who wants to join our Nine Li race, they must be tested by me first. Even if this child is as special as Romeo said, a test is inevitable. Didn't we reach that agreement at the beginning?"</p>

  <p>The voice was as sweet and melodious as a beautiful song. Even without seeing her, anyone who heard her voice could tell that she must be extremely beautiful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his gaze to the direction where the sound came from and saw a bright figure not too far away, floating in the air.</p>

  <p>It was a woman with snow-white skin and bare feet. She wasn't wearing any clothes, but her private parts were covered by pink silk cloth. Her silver hair was tied back in a bun, and her face was even more stunning.</p>

  <p>She blinked gently and looked Luo Zheng up and down.</p>

  <p>The moment she appeared, the tense atmosphere suddenly eased.</p>

  <p>Erik gave her a salute and said, "You are right, Grand Elder. I believe Giacomo wants to directly give this brat the blood!"</p>

  <p>'This woman is the Grand Elder?' Luo Zheng wondered in shock.</p>

  <p>After shooting a triumphant glance at Erik, Giacomo strode toward the Grand Elder and said, "I didn't mean it. I wanted to meet you, but not for the blood, because Luo Zheng doesn't need the blood at all!"</p>

  <p>Not understanding the meaning of Giacomo's words, the Grand Elder replied, "If he really has the strength to fight against the young talents of Yellow Emperor race, then he must accept the blood of our race. After all, according to the gambling agreement, the one who fights for our race must be a member of our race. So what do you mean, Giacomo?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that Luo Zheng is already a member of our race! Grand Elder, I wanted to come to you just to test the purity of his blood," Giacomo explained in a proud voice.</p>
