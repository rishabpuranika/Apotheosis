  <p>
</p>

  <p>A crack had appeared on Luo Zheng's forehead, which quickly ran down to his neck and body.</p>

  <p>It looked much like what you'd find on a porcelain vase that fell onto the ground. It was a narrow crack, but a trickle of blood slowly flowed out from it. It was frightening to behold, as if Luo Luo Zheng had been cut in half down the middle.</p>

  <p>However, his clothes remained completely undamaged. It was such an absurd thing.</p>

  <p>Despite the horrible appearance, the injury wasn't so serious though.</p>

  <p>The problem was how Nathan's spear had managed to cause such damage in the first place. It was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>His spear had sent out a purple flash of light, which had defused both Luo Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike and the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Although the light hadn't looked powerful at all, it had caused Luo Zheng's impressively strong body to split when it flashed past his ear.</p>

  <p>This was beyond everyone's wildest imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered with doubt as he stared fixedly at Nathan.</p>

  <p>The might of his spear was simply too frightening.</p>

  <p>If he had been directly hit by Nathan's spear, would his body have been shattered into pieces?</p>

  <p>He couldn't imagine how Nathan's spear skill was actually that great.</p>

  <p>"I was right! His attack is just as powerful as I predicted earlier!"</p>

  <p>Kurt remarked and a brief look of admiration flashed on his face as he stared unblinkingly at Nathan.</p>

  <p>He could now understand why he had foreseen a despairing scene of himself before when he fought against Nathan.</p>

  <p>Kurt wouldn't have been able to dodge Nathan's spear thrusts, nor could he withstand them. If he hadn't admitted defeat earlier, he too would have been shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Why is Nathan's spear so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it's incredible. It seems to contain some special power."</p>

  <p>"I can hardly believe my own two eyes. His attack had only flashed past Luo Zheng's face, but it almost split his body apart. What the hell is this spear skill of his capable of?"</p>

  <p>Many warriors commented and murmured with astonishment, as they watched the fight. Nathan was well-known as the number one Godly Genius, but that was the only thing that most people knew about him.</p>

  <p>Few warriors had seen this legendary warrior up close by themselves, so his skills remained a secret to the world.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that he was a powerful warrior, but no one could tell why he was the best out of all of the warriors.</p>

  <p>However, this single attack from Nathan had revealed one thing to most of the watching crowd? his power was something far beyond their knowledge. They could not even begin to understand what his power was at all.</p>

  <p>Only a few of the Supreme Lords could understand it. Everyone else, including the world lords and the Saint Lords couldn't comprehend the magnitude of his power.</p>

  <p>"Did he use the Space Law?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't look like that. It's true that the Space Law would have had a similar effect of defusing Luo Zheng's sword intent. However, it would have caused a black crack, because the power would shatter the space and reveal the shadow on the back of space."</p>

  <p>"They are in the Illusion Battlefield! The back of space doesn't exist there."</p>

  <p>Many knowledgeable warriors began heatedly debating the fight and tried to analyze the theory of Nathan's power.</p>

  <p>In the territory of the Xuanyuan Clan, every clan member was robed, and they all quietly stood in the middle of a massive square as they watched the fight happening on the picture scroll.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan Clan was a dominant force and occupied a leading position among the top four clans of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>However, compared to the three other great clans, the Xuanyuan Clan had the fewest number of warriors. The other three clans all had over a thousand branches and millions of members scattered through the universe.</p>

  <p>As for the Xuanyuan Clan, they numbered less than a hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>However, that had never been a bad thing. The smaller number made it an even greater honor to become a clan member, and of all the clans, the Xuanyuan Clan was the most cohesive of the four great clans.</p>

  <p>"Nathan has finally revealed his true strength," someone suddenly said, disturbing the silence.</p>

  <p>"This is after all the final battle. It's time for him to do so," someone else replied.</p>

  <p>"Honestly speaking, Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming both have the strength to oppose Nathan. They both obtained great inheritances from strong masters, but they will still be no match for Nathan in the end. His fate was preordained, and it had been decided at the moment of his birth, and it can never be changed. I don't know why you have been worried about him!" another warrior said. The third voice was a rough sounding voice, and it indicated that its owner was an obstinate and unruly guy. In the confines of the strict Xuanyuan Clan, this kind of warrior was extremely rare.</p>

  <p>They were full of confidence in Nathan because they all knew his strength so well.</p>

  <p>Back on the board in the Illusion Battlefield, Nathan's lips slowly curled into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>He was fully satisfied with the result of his attack.</p>

  <p>He did not plan on defeating Luo Luo Zheng quickly and neatly.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, Nathan had never been a ruthless or cruel person. Despite his solitary personality, he was at least morally upright.</p>

  <p>And people like Luo Luo Zheng could never affect his mood in the slightest.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, maybe because of Xi Youqin's sake, he couldn't help feeling annoyed with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He derived a deep satisfaction in knowing that Luo Luo Zheng had been wounded by his first attack.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He brandished his spear and its tip again flashed with a purple light. He looked at Luo Luo Zheng and asked with a smile, "How do you feel?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't reply, but merely stared straight at Nathan.</p>

  <p>The strangely intense feeling that Luo Luo Zheng had felt about Nathan was getting stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>The way Nathan brandished his spear, the position he stood, and the direction he faced... Everything looked almost strangely normal.</p>

  <p>However, everything had its limits. Once something was beyond someone's acceptable level, they would begin to feel strange about it Suppose that there was a woman with a perfect face, and when someone looked at her closely for a while, he or she would begin to feel inexplicably strange, as if there was something out of place.</p>

  <p>This was how Luo Luo Zheng felt about Nathan at that moment.</p>

  <p>He simply couldn't be bothered to answer Nathan's taunt.</p>

  <p>He knew clearly that he had to figure out the reason why he had this strange feeling if he wanted to defeat his opponent.</p>

  <p>However, it was inappropriate to just stand still and think, so this time Luo Luo Zheng took the initiative to attack.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed, but he did not rush directly toward Nathan.</p>

  <p>After having both witnessed and felt Nathan's great spear skill, Luo Luo Zheng knew that rushing at him blindly was likely courting death.</p>

  <p>Just as Kurt had done during his fight with Nathan, Luo Luo Zheng also started to move around him at a great and nimble speed.</p>

  <p>A spear could only stab in a single direction at a time.</p>

  <p>Although the purple light released by Nathan's spear had changed its direction once, it did not seem to have the ability to follow its target.</p>

  <p>Remaining mobile was the best way to counter Nathan's spear skill.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng therefore reached the same conclusion as Kurt.</p>

  <p>After all, being mobile would increase his chances of dodging Nathan's spear.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Nathan wore a wry smile. He thought nonchalantly, 'Kurt inevitably admitted defeat to me after moving around me for ten or so circles just now. Luo Luo Zheng, are you also going to admit defeat?'</p>

  <p>He grabbed the spear lightly in his hand and kept spinning around on the spot to face Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept moving on the board and circling around Nathan.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel tired now?" Nathan asked with a slightly condescending smile, his eyes flashing with a hint of ridicule.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your breath by struggling in vain. It is already an unparalleled honor for you to have won the chance to be defeated by me.</p>

  <p>If you can find any flaws in me, then my name's not Nathan."</p>

  <p>Nathan snorted with laughter. Clearly, he was not worried at all.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's movements are nothing but a waste of time!"</p>

  <p>"He will be defeated by Nathan sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"I think he's probably exhausted by his tricks. But Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be willing to admit defeat so easily in this battle for first place, right?"</p>

  <p>Many of the audience were baffled by Luo Zheng's actions, but no one believed that he stood a chance against Nathan.</p>

  <p>After half a minute or so, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly stopped in his tracks and stared hard at Nathan with a dumbfounded expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"Have you finally thought it through?" Nathan continued to ridicule him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and slightly lifted his lips into a devious smile.</p>

  <p>"So, surrender or die?" Nathan asked, impatient now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head again and suddenly gave a broad grin. He pointed up into the sky and then down at the ground, with a crafty glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Nathan raised his head curiously and saw many profound law fragments spinning in the air, exuding the full might of the heavens. That was the sign of a Thunder Tribulation, which had just been formed after Luo Zheng's establishing of a connection between heaven and earth!</p>

  <p>"Thunder Tribulations! And so many! Oh, damn!"</p>

  <p>Nathan cursed loudly and tried to scramble from his position, but it was already too late.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>A dozen circles appeared under his feet and as they layered together they limited his movements.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The divine lightning surged down like countless silver snakes and enveloped Nathan in a bright light.</p>

  <p>The power of the Thunderbolt Annihilation was magnificent. However, it was very difficult to secretly prepare it. This cultivation method was actually more suitable for creating traps.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, Nathan had lowered his guard because he thought that Luo Luo Zheng was just moving around him like Kurt had done.</p>

  <p>However, what Nathan didn't know, was that Kurt could predict his attacks through his Constellation Eyes, and thus he knew he had no chance of defeating him. As a result, he chose instead to give up the fight and he then immediately admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>Unlike Kurt, Luo Luo Zheng had no Constellation Eyes to predict the future. It still remained unknown who would finally win this fight. As he circled around Nathan, Luo Luo Zheng had secretly drawn his chaotic energy from inside his body and prepared a trap on the board.</p>

  <p>Eleven bolts of Thunderbolt Annihilation were equivalent to eleven heavenly tribulations. They were a heavy blow even to Nathan.</p>
