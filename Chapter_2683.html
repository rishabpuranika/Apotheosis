<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A pair of wings, made entirely out of thunder, burst out of Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>His wings were as wide as 200, 000 feet and covered half the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not want to deal with these consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The longer he dallied, the worse it would be for him.</p>

  <p>He had visited the bottom of the chaos and greatly improved his strength with Fuxi's help.</p>

  <p>However, it would be hard for him to escape and return to the fairy palace if he was surrounded by Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was a sharp vibration as Zheng's wings flapped. He turned his body and seemed to be preparing to fly away.</p>

  <p>Intimidated by his aura, nobody dared to stop him.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, Walton stepped forward. "Don't let him go!</p>

  <p>Even if he becomes bigger, he is still no match for us!"</p>

  <p>Two consummate True Gods from the Tang Clan got killed. If they let Zheng go, Walton wouldn't have the nerve to face Clark.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng heard this and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand, poised to slap Walton on the face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been practicing the Wild God system for a long time now and could easily handle his gigantic body. Instead of being heavy and slow, he was incomparably flexible and fast.</p>

  <p>There was no way Walton could dodge Zheng's slap. All he could do was put the huge sword shield across his chest in hopes of protecting himself.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The sword shield was a supreme primordial weapon in the divine land but Zheng's slap reduced it to rubble.</p>

  <p>A powerful force broke through the shield and hit Walton who was sent flying directly into a mountain.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a series of explosions as his body crashed into the mountain's face.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the entire mountain itself collapsed, and it wasn't the only one.</p>

  <p>The border of the Square Sky Region was surrounded by mountains but they began to collapse one by one.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred mountains were flattened!</p>

  <p>Had it been another consummate True God that was hit by Zheng's slap, then he or she would've died upon impact.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Walton exercised the Earth Godly Way and transferred the force onto the mountains.</p>

  <p>He was able to survive but he was sapped entirely of his strength. He couldn't even move his limbs as he lay on the broken stones.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was tense and very quiet after that.</p>

  <p>Walton's strength was considered only inferior to that of Rachelle and Troy, even a little stronger than Shahn's.</p>

  <p>Someone like him was slapped half to death by Zheng. Anyone else who dared to step forward would end up getting killed by the terrifying giant in front of them.</p>

  <p>The sea wind blew and flowing sea water poured in with the mountains' collapse.</p>

  <p>Even Rachelle shut up.</p>

  <p>Troy, on the other hand, flew over with his face extremely pale.</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch had also sent him flying hundreds of miles away.</p>

  <p>His iron hand returned to its original size but it was littered with cracks, having been damaged by Zheng's forceful fist.</p>

  <p>He stared at Zheng's huge body with complex emotions.</p>

  <p>None of them was prepared for this round against this young man.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans sent out all their consummate True Gods, thinking that their target was a mere True God, a consummate True God at most.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was true that Zheng had just reached his breakthrough but it was also a fact that even the Demi-holy Beings would find it hard to compete with his current strength.</p>

  <p>Even if they attacked at the same time, they'd only waste their forces and suffer numerous casualties.</p>

  <p>Under their watchful eyes, Zheng turned into a beam of light and flew away.</p>

  <p>With their target having flown away, the consummate True Gods could only stand there and look at Troy helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Follow him!" Troy ordered in frustration.</p>

  <p>There was no other choice but to follow.</p>

  <p>However, the consummate True Gods were careful to keep a large distance between them and Zheng. If Zheng changed his mind and decided to turn around, they'd hopefully still have the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>They knew they couldn't defeat Zheng so they would do the next best thing and run away.</p>

  <p>Thus, a group of consummate True Gods hung behind Zheng and looked as if they were escorting him rather than pursuing him.</p>

  <p>Zheng shot Tianming a glance as he passed him by before sending a secret message. "Tianming."</p>

  <p>Tianming heard and immediately floated up front.</p>

  <p>There was a subtle fluctuation that the other consummate True Gods might sense once the message was transmitted.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid being detected, Tianming came up front so no one else would notice the fluctuations. It helped that he was bolder than anybody else.</p>

  <p>Seeing Tianming follow behind Zheng closely made the others think of him as fearless and willing to go against such a great power.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, your progress is shocking!" Tianming said through his life vitality as he lightly moved his lips.</p>

  <p>"Which clan are you hiding in?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan," Tianming said.</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly surprised with his answer.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, Wynn told him that Tianming had his own fate.</p>

  <p>He never expected Tianming to take a completely different path once he arrived in the divine land, even going as far as hiding in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat when he thought of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>On the day he met his mother underground, Zheng used the Spiritual Darkness to cultivate himself. After his cultivation, his mother immediately sent him out of the divine land.</p>

  <p>She told him that the Holy Beings had found her. Zheng had no idea where she might be. Perhaps she was taken away by Nicholas?</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of Lorena Li in the Dongfang Clan?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Lorena Li? I've never heard of her. Who is she?" Tianming answered.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart sank at his answer.</p>

  <p>What he feared most was the possibility that his mother might have died.</p>

  <p>He hoped that she was merely taken away by Nicholas. At least he would still have a chance to save her.</p>

  <p>"She's my mother," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>This surprised Tianming greatly. "Your mother?"</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago, my mother sent me away for my safety. I was unwilling but I had no choice," Zheng explained. "I'm afraid that she may have fallen into Nicholas' hands."</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes flashed. "I've been greatly valued by Nicholas in the past few years. I can go to any place in the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island, except for the back hall. I heard a Demi-holy Being of the clan complain about Nicholas being seduced by a woman and neglecting his duties these years."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at Tianming's message.</p>
