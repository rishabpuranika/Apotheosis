  <p>
</p>

  <p>A pair of wings, made entirely out of thunder, burst out of Luo Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>His wings were as wide as 200, 000 feet and covered half the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not want to deal with these consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The longer he dallied, the worse it would be for him.</p>

  <p>He had visited the bottom of the chaos and greatly improved his strength with Fuxi's help.</p>

  <p>However, it would be hard for him to escape and return to the Immortal Mansion if he was surrounded by Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was a sharp vibration as Luo Zheng's wings flapped. He turned his body and seemed to be preparing to fly away.</p>

  <p>Intimidated by his aura, nobody dared to stop him.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, Walton stepped forward. "Don't let him go!</p>

  <p>Even if he becomes bigger, he is still no match for us!"</p>

  <p>Two consummate True Gods from the Tang Clan got killed. If they let Luo Zheng go, Walton wouldn't have the nerve to face Clark.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng heard this and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand, poised to slap Walton on the face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been practicing the Wild God system for a long time now and could easily handle his gigantic body. Instead of being heavy and slow, he was incomparably flexible and fast.</p>

  <p>There was no way Walton could dodge Luo Zheng's slap. All he could do was put the huge sword shield across his chest in hopes of protecting himself.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The sword shield was a supreme primordial weapon in the divine land but Luo Zheng's slap reduced it to rubble.</p>

  <p>A powerful force broke through the shield and hit Walton who was sent flying directly into a mountain.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a series of explosions as his body crashed into the mountain's face.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the entire mountain itself collapsed, and it wasn't the only one.</p>

  <p>The border of the Square Sky Region was surrounded by mountains but they began to collapse one by one.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred mountains were flattened!</p>

  <p>Had it been another consummate True God that was hit by Luo Zheng's slap, then he or she would've died upon impact.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Walton exercised the Earth Divine Dao and transferred the force onto the mountains.</p>

  <p>He was able to survive but he was sapped entirely of his strength. He couldn't even move his limbs as he lay on the broken stones.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was tense and very quiet after that.</p>

  <p>Walton's strength was considered only inferior to that of Rachelle and Troy, even a little stronger than Shahn's.</p>

  <p>Someone like him was slapped half to death by Luo Zheng. Anyone else who dared to step forward would end up getting killed by the terrifying giant in front of them.</p>

  <p>The sea wind blew and flowing sea water poured in with the mountains' collapse.</p>

  <p>Even Rachelle shut up.</p>

  <p>Troy, on the other hand, flew over with his face extremely pale.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch had also sent him flying hundreds of miles away.</p>

  <p>His iron hand returned to its original size but it was littered with cracks, having been damaged by Luo Zheng's forceful fist.</p>

  <p>He stared at Luo Zheng's huge body with complex emotions.</p>

  <p>None of them was prepared for this round against this young man.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans sent out all their consummate True Gods, thinking that their target was a mere True God, a consummate True God at most.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was true that Luo Zheng had just reached his breakthrough but it was also a fact that even the Demi-holy Beings would find it hard to compete with his current strength.</p>

  <p>Even if they attacked at the same time, they'd only waste their forces and suffer numerous casualties.</p>

  <p>Under their watchful eyes, Luo Zheng turned into a beam of light and flew away.</p>

  <p>With their target having flown away, the consummate True Gods could only stand there and look at Troy helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Follow him!" Troy ordered in frustration.</p>

  <p>There was no other choice but to follow.</p>

  <p>However, the consummate True Gods were careful to keep a large distance between them and Luo Zheng. If Luo Zheng changed his mind and decided to turn around, they'd hopefully still have the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>They knew they couldn't defeat Luo Zheng so they would do the next best thing and run away.</p>

  <p>Thus, a group of consummate True Gods hung behind Luo Zheng and looked as if they were escorting him rather than pursuing him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot Tianming a glance as he passed him by before sending a secret message. "Tianming."</p>

  <p>Tianming heard and immediately floated up front.</p>

  <p>There was a subtle fluctuation that the other consummate True Gods might sense once the message was transmitted.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid being detected, Tianming came up front so no one else would notice the fluctuations. It helped that he was bolder than anybody else.</p>

  <p>Seeing Tianming follow behind Luo Zheng closely made the others think of him as fearless and willing to go against such a great power.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, your progress is shocking!" Tianming said through his life vitality as he lightly moved his lips.</p>

  <p>"Which clan are you hiding in?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan," Tianming said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly surprised with his answer.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, Wynn told him that Tianming had his own fate.</p>

  <p>He never expected Tianming to take a completely different path once he arrived in the divine land, even going as far as hiding in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat when he thought of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>On the day he met his mother underground, Luo Zheng used the Spiritual Darkness to cultivate himself. After his cultivation, his mother immediately sent him out of the divine land.</p>

  <p>She told him that the Holy Beings had found her. Luo Zheng had no idea where she might be. Perhaps she was taken away by Nicholas?</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of Li Luoshui Li in the Dongfang Clan?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Li Luoshui Li? I've never heard of her. Who is she?" Tianming answered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart sank at his answer.</p>

  <p>What he feared most was the possibility that his mother might have died.</p>

  <p>He hoped that she was merely taken away by Nicholas. At least he would still have a chance to save her.</p>

  <p>"She's my mother," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>This surprised Tianming greatly. "Your mother?"</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago, my mother sent me away for my safety. I was unwilling but I had no choice," Luo Zheng explained. "I'm afraid that she may have fallen into Nicholas' hands."</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes flashed. "I've been greatly valued by Nicholas in the past few years. I can go to any place in the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island, except for the back hall. I heard a Demi-holy Being of the clan complain about Nicholas being seduced by a woman and neglecting his duties these years."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at Tianming's message.</p>
