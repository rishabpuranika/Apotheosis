<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought about it for a few moments, and then decided not to linger anymore.</p>

  <p>He rose up ten feet above the ground in a flash, like a graceful eagle soaring high in the air.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior were gone, the group of warriors who had gathered in the city emerged from the gates like an army of crabs.</p>

  <p>Once they had left the city gates, all of them scattered everywhere as they tried their best to stay away from each other.</p>

  <p>This was the rule of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>It was known that once they left the cities, dangers lay ahead.</p>

  <p>They could be skilled hunters, but that didn't mean they couldn't become prey to others.</p>

  <p>An ordinary-looking ogre warrior rushed out of the city gates along with the other warriors. Once he got out, his lips curved up into a strange smile.</p>

  <p>"Purple Flame Explosion!"</p>

  <p>Purple-colored flames suddenly exploded from the ogre warrior's body.</p>

  <p>The profound Fire Law formed ripple-like flames. The flames then spread outwards, while the ogre stood still in the center.</p>

  <p>At that point, more than a hundred warriors had emerged from the city gates already.</p>

  <p>When the other ogre warriors sensed what was happening, they all displayed their life vitality or forceful energy and tried to protect themselves from the burning hot purple flames.</p>

  <p>However, the purple flames were too powerful, burning the ogres' protective life vitality or forceful energy like it was a thin piece of paper.</p>

  <p>Their fiery tendrils were like an animal that licked the warriors' bodies.</p>

  <p>"Aaaargh!"</p>

  <p>"These damned flames fucking hurt!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the purple flames had burned all of the warriors.</p>

  <p>Some of them used escape techniques and flew into the air. But the faster they moved, the more flames they ignited. They only got to fly about half their intended distance before they burned into ashes, scattering in the air.</p>

  <p>Some of them used crystal clear ice shields to block the flames from their bodies, but the power of these flames was beyond imagination. The ice shields they formed instantly melted, and they still got burned to a crisp.</p>

  <p>After those warriors died, a beam of red light shot up from everyone's body and flew back to the city.</p>

  <p>As for that ogre warrior, he absorbed half of the Illusion Points of the dead.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior stood casually at the city gates with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>Purple flames slowly pulsed in his palm as he eyed the warriors inside the city.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior's flames had spread to around 10, 000 feet in diameter, but those that spread towards the city vanished completely in a mere second.</p>

  <p>At the current stage, the space within this city was still safe. Any attacks would be neutralized at the city gates.</p>

  <p>In addition, all the cities in the entire Illusion Battlefield, which covered fifty supreme worlds, were in the same condition as well.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior had already absorbed about 6, 000 Illusion Points in just a short amount of time, and he was also quickly rising up the ranks.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" an icy voice asked. Soft footsteps were heard from within the city, which turned out to be from the leader of the group of warriors who had just got killed.</p>

  <p>So far, there were still many warriors who weren't aware of the current situation. After all, most of the warriors in the city were ogres, who were all against Luo Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior because they were humans.</p>

  <p>However, they never expected that one of their own kind would mercilessly attack them.</p>

  <p>The ogre snorted and asked, "Is it important?"</p>

  <p>"We are all ogres. Why did you attack us? Are you out of your mind?"</p>

  <p>Some of the ogres then began to shout and protest in anger.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior cut him off and said, "I don't want to hear nonsense. I only know that there is no race within the Illusion Battlefield, and the losers will all be eliminated. You're all just stepping stones for me so I can ascend to the top of the rankings!"</p>

  <p>Many ogre warriors were enraged by his words, but strangely enough, even more of them felt enlightened.</p>

  <p>Although many of the ogre warriors had made sufficient mental preparations to welcome the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, it was clear that they didn't have a deep understanding of it. The Illusion Battlefield was literally a survival of the fittest; only those who were strong and cruel enough would live.</p>

  <p>Clinging to the idea that creatures of the same race should help each other was no different from childish ridiculousness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the ogre warrior walked towards the city gates with the purple flames burning strongly in his hand. Then, he extended his hand inside the city gates. The moment his hand crossed the boundary, the flames were extinguished because of the rules of the Illusion Battlefield. "My name is Layne," he said.</p>

  <p>He quickly turned around after he spoke. He knew that the warriors in the city would not come out to die, so staying there would be a waste of time.</p>

  <p>"Layne!"</p>

  <p>"So it's him!"</p>

  <p>"The ninth generation successor of the lord of the Ogre Flame World."</p>

  <p>"Being in the same city as him can also be considered our bad luck!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, what's there to be unlucky about? All the Soul Sea Realm warriors from 100, 000 supreme worlds have entered the Illusion Battlefield. Every city has a few mighty warriors that we can't afford to offend. Now, I wonder if Layne could fight against those two human warriors. I wish they would have a battle."</p>

  <p>Once Layne's figure was out of view, the warriors inside the city rushed outside again.</p>

  <p>It was common for things such as blocking the city gates to happen in the beginning of the competition in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>At this moment, many warriors had already stood out in the ranking list.</p>

  <p>There were countless Illusion Spaces in the 100, 000 supreme worlds outside the Illusion Battlefield. And there was a pyramid on top of each Illusion Space. The pyramids displayed the rankings of all the participants in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Creatures of all races and forces closely watched the change of rankings.</p>

  <p>And because there were many unexpected accidents, the names of the warriors inside the Illusion Battlefield rose and dropped constantly in the ranking list.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A wind blade shot out from Luo Zheng's fingertip.</p>

  <p>Several deer with grey horns crawled on the ground not far ahead. The deer looked quite docile, but they were actually fierce tenth-level beasts.</p>

  <p>The wind blade zipped through the air and passed through several deer's chests. Cries of death followed; then the deer lost their vitality. Luo Zheng's wind blade had shattered their body organs.</p>

  <p>The dead deer soon disappeared from Luo Zheng's field of view. Then, pale yellow Illusion Points shot towards his body.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Killing beasts can also gain Illusion Points. But killing a deer only gains an Illusion Point," Luo Luo Zheng cried.</p>

  <p>A helpless sigh escaped his lips as he shook his head. It was true that one could gain Illusion Points by hunting beasts. However, the Illusion Battlefield was an extremely huge arena, and its real intention was to encourage warriors to fight each other and compete for the title of strongest victor. Therefore, the rewards for killing beasts were relatively small.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how many Illusion Points I can get if I hunt stronger beasts," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed once more as he leapt onto the hillside and rushed forward at a moderate pace.</p>

  <p>If ever he encountered any beasts along the way, then he would attack and kill them.</p>

  <p>A vicious beast of the same level as the deer with gray horns would only give Luo Luo Zheng one or two Illusion Points. The amount of Illusion Points was negligible, and he did not care about it.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, the initial accumulation of Illusion Points was not important. After some of the stronger warriors had accumulated enough Illusion Points, Luo Luo Zheng would kill them to snatch their points.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could even just lie here and cultivate, or even find a place to sleep.</p>

  <p>But he had finally gotten a chance to leave after being trapped in the fairy palace for so many years. Thus, he actually wanted to wander aimlessly around the vast Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng slowed down his speed, his eyes suddenly flashed and the corner of his lips slightly curved up.</p>

  <p>He paused in mid-air, then turned his head and looked down. "How long are you planning to follow me?"</p>

  <p>The wilderness was completely quiet except for his voice, as if there were no other life forms.</p>

  <p id="top_1">"After you accumulate a little more Illusion Points, come and find me again. I am not very interested in you right now," Luo Luo Zheng said indifferently, and continued to fly forward.</p>

  <p>Three people had been following Luo Luo Zheng, so they definitely didn't have the time to accumulate enough Illusion Points. Luo Luo Zheng would only earn 150 Illusion Points even if he killed all three of them, so he really wasn't interested.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of rough laughter; then three burly figures appeared out of thin air. Three impressive ogre warriors eyed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! But we are interested in you!"</p>
