<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>What kind of attitude did the Dongfang Clan hold toward the anonymous man? And how would the Han Clan react?</p>

  <p>Anyway, all that had nothing to do with Nelly. Her goal was to earn points from the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Normally, no one would covet the anonymous man's points too much.</p>

  <p>The rankings of the Floating Islands usually changed every few decades.</p>

  <p>Even if someone managed to take the points of the anonymous man, they would then become the target of other warriors.</p>

  <p>Although Nelly was temporarily ranked the first among the low-rank True Gods, there was no guarantee that she would always win.</p>

  <p>Usually, the high points that a warrior gathered would slowly be diluted during the many battles.</p>

  <p>But now, the situation was different. The final rankings of the Floating Islands were about to be released. Nelly had already finished her three compulsory battles this month. And if she defeated the anonymous man, she would get all his points. That way, her feat was equivalent to a consummate True God's in the Mu Clan. By then, her points would well exceed that of her sister Rachelle's.</p>

  <p>The key was to defeat the anonymous man in front of her, and Nelly was well-prepared for this battle.</p>

  <p>Within the energy that spread out from her body were two completely different forces.</p>

  <p>One of the forces was the Murdering Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In most powerful clans, warriors cultivated the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, the Mu Clan was different. The Godly Way that Murphy had mastered was the Murdering Godly Way, and ever since then, it was also this Godly Way that almost all of the warriors in the Mu Clan cultivated.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had cultivated it, and so had Nelly.</p>

  <p>However, there was a slight difference in the skillset of Nelly and that of her sister. When Nelly had been cultivating the Murdering Godly Way, she had grasped another kind of Godly Way at the same time— the Life Godly Way.</p>

  <p>When she had first encountered this new Godly Way, Nelly had been a little confused. It wasn't unheard of for warriors from rich and powerful clans to comprehend several kinds of Godly Ways at the same time, but they would all finally choose one Godly Way as their major Godly Way while the others would be their auxiliary Godly Ways. But when Nelly had condensed her Godly Tile, she had somehow condensed a unique dual Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Her Godly Tile was split right in the middle. The left side was blood red while the right side was cyan green, and these two sides exuded two completely different auras.</p>

  <p>As soon as her father Murphy had heard about this, he had gone to the Godly Way Tablet of the Life Godly Way to learn about it. Then, he had combined the Murdering Godly Way he had comprehended with the Life Godly Way to create the "theurgy beyond way" that was suitable for Nelly to cultivate.</p>

  <p>The Murdering Godly Way and the Life Godly Way were two extremes, like fire and water. However, Murphy, who had been immersed in the Murdering Godly Way for countless divine eras, had figured out how to successfully combine the two Godly Ways. He had insisted that if Nelly succeeded in mastering the theurgy, then she would definitely surpass her sister one day.</p>

  <p>To some extent, his words had come true. Nelly was ranked first among the low-rank True Gods. Ever since she had defeated Liusu several months ago, she had not lost even a single battle.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>As the red and green light spread around them, it seemed as if all living creatures had come to life on the blood-red plain. Zheng could feel strong vitality and vigor in the light. Black and red plants rapidly grew out of the ground one by one. These plants, which had been created by the Life Godly Way, were radiating a strong killing aura, as if they were plants growing in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"It's about time..."</p>

  <p>Nelly charged forward, running toward Zheng like a deer in the forest. As she ran, she tightened her grip on the black short sword in her hand, and her ponytail swayed majestically behind her in the wind.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It took only a split moment before the black short sword came slashing down toward Zheng, as if it had cut off the space between them altogether.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that they were fighting with each other and they didn't know each other's strength, so they were sort of testing each other at first. Zheng didn't take out his Buddha Emperor Sword. Instead, he dodged Nelly's attack slightly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Nelly struck about eight consecutive times, but Zheng dodged all her strikes with his skillful bodily movement. Each time she swung the sword, there was a tide of blood about dozens of feet high behind Zheng. It was the same theurgy that Rachelle had used when fighting against Harold.</p>

  <p>"All you can do is escape?" A hint of impatience appeared in Nelly's eyes.</p>

  <p>People who practiced the Murdering Godly Way would also be affected by it, and they would gradually become addicted to slaughtering people.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was like this, and Nelly was no exception. Since Zheng wasn't fighting with her head-on and all of her strikes had failed to hit him, she felt extremely irritated.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, Zheng stretched out his hand like lightning in an attempt to take away Nelly's black short sword.</p>

  <p>"You're too naive!"</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on Nelly's face. This was her chance.</p>

  <p>She suddenly lifted her black short sword and said, "Blood Breaking Bite!"</p>

  <p>Her voice had hardly faded away when a blood snake shot out of the sword and turned its head to bite Zheng on his arm.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng retreated almost immediately, he wasn't able to avoid the snake's fangs. Unexpectedly, Nelly didn't take the opportunity to continue her attack. She just stood there and looked at Zheng with pity. As Zheng retreated, blood continued to gush out of his arm.</p>

  <p>Zheng had retreated more than a hundred feet in one go while blood spurted out madly from his arm, leaving a golden trail of blood on the ground.</p>

  <p>When he stopped, he raised his arm and looked closely. There was no wound in the place that the blood snake had bitten him. Instead, there was a unique blood-red circular mark. Inside that mark was a triangular hole from which his blood flowed out continuously.</p>

  <p>This tiny hole must have been where the blood snake had bitten him, but when had the circular mark been engraved on his arm?</p>

  <p>Besides, given that the blood energy of Zheng's physical body was extremely powerful, the small wound should have been healed in the blink of an eye. However, while he had retreated, not only had the small wound not healed, but there seemed to be a strange force that was extracting the blood from his body.</p>

  <p>Even more strangely, his arm stopped bleeding when he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Why did you stop? Keep running,"</p>

  <p>Nelly said with a faint smile. She abruptly shot out a blood-red sword radiance from over a hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the sword radiance turned into a bloody tide that came at Zheng overwhelmingly.</p>

  <p>Caught in a critical situation, Zheng moved sideways by thirty feet, but just as he began to move, the blood in his arm spurted out madly again, leaving a 30-foot-long trail of blood behind him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand what's happening to you?" Nelly commented, her smile growing bigger. She continued, "I guess I overestimated your strength. You got hit by the Blood Breaking Bite in such a short time. As long as you move, blood will flow out from the wound until the last drop of blood in your body is sucked dry!"</p>

  <p>When the Blood Breaking theurgy in the Murdering Godly Way was employed, no matter what kind of defense the opponent was using, the opponent would suffer a horrible wound that was very difficult to heal.</p>

  <p>However, after Murphy had helped Nelly to combine the Murdering Godly Way and the Life Godly Way, he had created the "Blood Breaking Bite" with his new understanding of the Life Godly Way. Once an opponent was hit by the Blood Breaking Bite, the wound they suffered would be impossible to heal. Moreover, as long as the wound moved, it would cause the power in the mark to rapidly draw the opponent's blood.</p>

  <p>"A very interesting theurgy beyond way..." Zheng replied. Then, a smile appeared on his face too as he asked, "What if I don't move? Wouldn't this technique become useless then?"</p>

  <p>After saying that, he sat down cross-legged on the ground.</p>

  <p>"You are full of yourself!" Nelly sneered. "I want to know how long you can survive my attacks without moving..."</p>

  <p>But before she could finish her sentence, she saw some kind of energy reverberating around Zheng. The streams of strength source were so heavy, that they distorted the space around him. Before long, four invisible swords appeared.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword, the Heavenly Tooth Sword, and the Long Vine Sword floated horizontally in front of his chest, while the Grant Sun Sword circled above his head continuously to protect him.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng said, "I want to know if I can kill you without moving."</p>

  <p>"Gods Killing Sword Array! You've really mastered it..." Nelly's eyebrows twitched slightly, and a look of vigilance appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Once again, before Nelly could finish her words, Zheng waved his hands gently and began to use the Separate Controlling of the Purple Aura Godly Way. The Buddha Emperor Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword became like twin stars in the sky, spiraling into the air and shooting down toward Nelly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Long Vine Sword quietly disappeared into the ground.</p>

  <p>When it came out the next moment, there were countless invisible vines formed by strength condensed around it, and these vines were rushing toward Nelly!</p>

  <p>The four swords of the Gods Killing Sword Array were working together to fight the enemy. The Long Vine Sword was mainly used to bind the enemy before the Buddha Emperor Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword came to kill the enemy. As for the Grant Sun Sword, which continued to hover above Zheng's head, it was used to protect the owner.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng was defending himself against an enemy with a complete Gods Killing Sword Array. While simultaneously controlling the four swords with the Separate Controlling technique, he activated the Infinity Ruler with the internal momentum. Then, golden rings appeared in his eyes. He looked at the wound on his arm.</p>

  <p>What Nelly had cultivated was the Murdering Godly Way, and Zheng wanted to absorb it into the Infinity Ruler. Moreover, he wanted to know what the mysterious Blood Breaking Bite was.</p>
