</p>

  <p>The wounds on the Separate Abyss warrior's body had stopped bleeding.</p>

  <p>But there were still black snakes the length of a forefinger slithering on the wounds— these little creatures were supposedly transformed by energy.</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng's footsteps approaching, his eyes widened like that of a frightened bird.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's image grew clearer, a look of horror filled the warrior's eyes— his body unconsciously curled up in defense.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race was a powerful force— a near-perfect race indeed.</p>

  <p>They had the Abyss Spirit race to protect them on the Other Shore, after all.</p>

  <p>Their power assured them of the potential to eventually become a ruling civilization among the many superpowers.</p>

  <p>They looked down upon the other races with great pride and arrogance.</p>

  <p>But the moment the warrior spotted Zheng, fear wiped away any hint of arrogance on his face— he trembled in fear like prey that had spotted its hunter.</p>

  <p>"What happened here?" Zheng asked, examining the area.</p>

  <p>While the warrior was sure Zheng had come to take his life, the latter's question made him realize that Zheng held no animosity towards him. For a moment, he paused and looked at Zheng strangely before saying, "That guy…</p>

  <p>The one who calls himself the Evil God… when he entered this place, he began slaughtering everyone in his path!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, such was the work of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Zheng's guess was proven, then.</p>

  <p>It was known that many races killed each other off in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>But with everyone scattered, most warriors were vigilant in meeting strange opponents. So long as the two races didn't carry deep grudges, they were even willing to cooperate.</p>

  <p>The cave was far larger than the one Chaim and the others had first discovered. More creatures of different races were also there to explore.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for an ordinary warrior to slaughter so many people at a time.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God may be powerful, but he couldn't have killed so many people at once. Couldn't you have just run away?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Even with the hurricane blowing, the warriors there should have been able to flee.</p>

  <p>Getting blown away by the hurricane was preferable to getting slaughtered by the Evil God, anyway.</p>

  <p>But the fear grew on the warrior's face upon hearing Zheng's question. "His… his Other Shore Token is strange… It's an entire world! He controlled the world, and we had no chance of escaping. If it wasn't for my Other Shore Token— the Death Feigning Beast, I would've died along with the others for sure."</p>

  <p>The Death Feigning Beast was a creature from Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Taming the living beings on the Other Shore was no easy task, but the Abyss Spirit race had controlled the entire Stage Eleven, so they naturally had ways to make it.</p>

  <p>But the Death Feigning Beasts were not powerful on their own, and few people would fuse with such Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Separate Abyss race had entrusted the Ear Mice to auction off the Death Feigning Beasts. Even if the price was reasonable, rarely did anyone buy them.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore Realm warriors chose to merge with a Death Feigning Beast after cultivating the second kind of Truth of Godly Way. When such a token was activated, the aura of the cultivator's inner world along with the cinnabar field was blocked— they were then left in a state of suspended animation.</p>

  <p>If a spiritual sense or the like was used to detect it, no sign of life would be sensed— it would be as though the cultivator was truly dead.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God had killed so many creatures of various races at a time, so he didn't even bother checking each one individually. In truth, he cared little about a few of them escaping his slaughter— all that mattered was his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>And so this particular warrior of the Separate Abyss race managed to escape death.</p>

  <p>But the black four-legged snakes that attached to his wounds were still torturing him to death— removing them was no easy task.</p>

  <p>"A world…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as he asked, "Chaim, have you heard of a similar Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact was not a world. It merely represented a civilization that connected the entire Regal Jade City.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Regal Jade Spirit, Zheng could receive the help of the entire Regal Jade Civilization as well. Like during the hurricane, the Regal Jade Spirit pulled out a feather of the Wing King from the Civilization Artifact and helped him resist the calamity.</p>

  <p>"Bloody Descent," Chaim said after a pause.</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The leader of our Bright Mountain has an Other Shore Token of the descending type. But instead of an item, it is a special world that descends,"</p>

  <p>Chaim explained. "Such Other Shore Tokens could only be owned by the most powerful masters of the Source World. This so-called Evil God..."</p>

  <p>"He's that young man in black," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Chaim stared at Zheng wordlessly. The young man clad in black hadn't introduced himself yet.</p>

  <p>At the thought that Zheng's inner world had actually created such a terrifying existence, Chaim was utterly speechless. A freak created a freak, he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"This Evil God can only move around in the thirteen stages of the Lust World. I'm afraid it's unlikely that he'll manage to obtain such an Other Shore Token," Chaim said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the black four-legged snakes and asked the warrior, "Do you want me to help you get rid of them?"</p>

  <p>"No! Don't touch them! I will refine them myself!" The warrior's face darkened at Zheng's offer.</p>

  <p>The four-legged snakes were highly strange creatures. The moment any one of them was removed from his body, the pain would be enough to kill the warrior. Even the strongest of the Separate Abyss race couldn't endure such torture. This warrior had done the work step by step, yet he only managed to refine four of them. There were over ten snakes still left on his body.</p>

  <p>Refining each would take ages.</p>

  <p>If Zheng removed them all by force, the warrior would faint from the pain.</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned to examine the little snakes more closely, but since the warrior seemed to be on high alert around him, he backed off.</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Zheng left him be and followed Sally and Chaim out of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, this Evil God is highly talented. Haven't you noticed that when he was in your inner world?" Finally, Chaim took a chance and asked what had been plaguing his mind since they were at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Everyone had absolute control over their inner world and Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I was aware of it. He even plotted to kill me," Zheng said with a playful smile.</p>

  <p>The casual statement made Sally's and Chaim's eyes widen in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was bold indeed— they found themselves lucky to not have such a creature in their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>"But he did help me stabilize my inner world quite a bit. He actually helped me a lot," Zheng admitted. "I merely fulfilled my promise and released him."</p>

  <p>From the start, Zheng hadn't expected the Evil God's nature to remain the same. Worse, he became more reckless after leaving his inner world. It was all fate's doing, Zheng believed.</p>

  <p>Chaim asked no further.</p>

  <p>He found it strange how powerful the Evil God was— it probably had something to do with Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>But if he continued asking, he was afraid to accidentally touch upon some of Zheng's secrets that would make the latter uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Once they left the cave, the three continued travelling toward the core area.</p>

  <p>After they moved forward for a while, they dug a hole to use as a shelter and waited for the hurricane to pass.</p>

  <p>When it passed, they continued with their journey.</p>

  <p>But when they stepped out of the hole, Sally and Zheng felt something simultaneously and exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>The two happened to perceive that Elvinia and Hutton were five hundred miles south of them, running fast.</p>

  <p>Even when the hurricane stopped, they were moving at such a high speed.</p>

  <p>Either they were chasing someone or were being chased— Zheng and Sally were both inclined to believe it was the latter.</p>
