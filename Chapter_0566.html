<br/><br/>

  

  <p> 400 feet...</p>

  <p>300 feet...</p>

  <p>200 feet...</p>

  <p>Their eyes gazed at the stones that loomed before them as they drew nearer to a dead end. Could they still survive in such a desperate situation?</p>

  <p>The atmosphere grew more tense as their uncertainty increased. If it was a common dead end, they had no choice but to die.</p>

  <p>"Colors! They have different colors!" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly shouted. He was the first one who noticed the difference in color. He found that there were rows of runes on the stone pillars' surfaces at the dead end.</p>

  <p>"March!" Tianming said and rushed forward. His eyes glinted as he charged with gritted teeth. Although he didn't know what the runes meant, he saw a silver lining. Besides, they had no way back.</p>

  <p>The lava tide surged again. The stone pillars would be soon submerged in it, since only the tops of the pillars were visible now.</p>

  <p>There were ten stone pillars in the dead end, and every pillar was circled by runes. When Luo Luo Zheng stepped on them, the runes lit up.</p>

  <p>He swiftly moved past ten pillars, and each one of them lit up.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng came to the end. Suddenly, a vortex appeared.</p>

  <p>The dark bluish-grey vortex was similar to the vortex that they had encountered under the arched gateway of the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>"A road!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed. His eyes brightened and a smile found its way to his face. It turned out that he was right in the gamble.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Tianming had followed and caught up to him. When he reached the last pillar and stepped on it, a vortex appeared in front of him as well.</p>

  <p>Did that mean everyone had a vortex?</p>

  <p>At that moment, another person rushed to the scene. Lewis looked like he fell into the waters but was able to grasp at a life-saving straw. When he saw the vortex, he raced so fast that he was even quicker than Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming had been. He even jumped into the air with his unique bodily movement skills which he took much pride in, and landed steadily on the last pillar.</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>But he didn't see a third vortex appear in front of him.</p>

  <p>'What happened?' he wondered. Lewis blanched. The lava tide surged higher and had already reached the pillars' surface. Why wasn't there a vortex for him? "Damn it! I don't care. I'll just jump in any of the vortexes."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, he jumped into one of the vortexes.</p>

  <p>However, when he got in halfway, a huge repelling force pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"This is not the vortex you have triggered. You can't go in. Did you miss any pillar just now?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in a heavy tone. Meanwhile, the lava rose higher and higher.</p>

  <p>"Ummm...it seems like so..."</p>

  <p>Lewis' nerves were on edge. He got too excited when he saw the vortexes that he jumped over the fourth pillar and missed it.</p>

  <p>"Go back to step on it!" Luo Luo Zheng said. "But... but..."</p>

  <p>The fourth pillar was almost submerged by the lava tide already. The runes flickered in the view as the orange glow of the lahar rose continuously.</p>

  <p>"Okay. But we don't care if you die or not," Tianming said coldly and then he turned to Luo Luo Zheng, "It's time we went inside. Let's go, Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>After Tianming spoke, Lewis flew into the air with gritted teeth. He hovered above for a while, then landed effortlessly on the fourth pillar. It wasn't a surprise for him to make it as he was skilled at bodily movement himself. He was like a giant bird that soared in the air as he lit the runes on the pillar with his tiptoe, then he swiftly came back.</p>

  <p>All the pillars were now submerged by the lava. Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming already jumped into the vortexes. Unfortunately, Lewis had nowhere to stand on now.</p>

  <p>"I'll step!</p>

  <p>Step!</p>

  <p>Step!"</p>

  <p>Luckily, Lewis had mastered extraordinary bodily movement skill. If it were Luo Luo Zheng or Tianming who was in the same situation, they probably would not succeed. Lewis could gain momentum and fly into the air. He was able to maintain the height he reached in the air with the help of his cloak.</p>

  <p>He looked like a hen that struggled to flap its wings when he performed his special method. Unfortunately, he fell down despite his great efforts to maintain balance.</p>

  <p>In the end, Lewis fell into the vortex and left a downward parabola-like trace in the air.</p>

  <p>After he fell into the vortex, he fell heavily on the ground with a resounding thud.</p>

  <p>He clutched his right foot in his hands and groaned in pain. Apparently, his foot was hurt.</p>

  <p>The lava already covered the pillars when he fled the place, and the molten liquid was extremely hot. Even Lewis only touched the pillar with his tiptoe, some lava was splashed on his foot.</p>

  <p>Not everyone had an indestructible body like Luo Luo Zheng. It was extremely painful to be burned by the lava.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there was a clattering sound.</p>

  <p>Tianming threw Lewis a small bottle. "Take it. It is Ice Pill for treating wounds from empyrosis."</p>

  <p>Lewis looked at him gratefully. He took the pill and put it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>As Lewis swallowed the pill, Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming looked around to check the surroundings.</p>

  <p>The road they had chosen was the Death Road, but the test they had gone through just now wasn't as difficult as they had imagined. They could easily conquer it as long as they were firm enough. Since they picked the Death Road, then the real test lay ahead.</p>

  <p>They seemed to have entered a separate space after they went through the vortexes. The space was dim and the sky was grey, with only a few flashes of light in it. The surroundings had a depressing effect. It was like a cramped place where daylight would never come.</p>

  <p>There was a jungle in the distance. The darkness in the jungle was even more frightening, as no one knew what mysterious and powerful beings would lurk in there.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Luo Luo Zheng announced. Tianming followed him closely. Lewis hurriedly stood up and hobbled along behind. Although cultivators usually recovered rapidly and Lewis took an Ice Pill from Tianming, it still took some time for the wound to heal completely.</p>
