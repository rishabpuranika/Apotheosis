<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 96 A Rich Harvest Of Crystal Cores (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were many more of blade locusts than there had been in the previous waves, but thanks to the presence of Luo Zheng "the Windmill," they were destroyed more quickly than before. After the dozens of blade locust officers were slaughtered, the remaining blade locusts withdrew.</p>

  <p>Since there was a heap of blade locust corpses on the ground waiting for Luo Zheng to pick through, gathering the spoils, he didn't give chase to the retreating blade locusts.</p>

  <p>Martin was puzzled at the sight of the blade locusts retreating, a thought flashed, and his face darkened at the possibility that came to his mind.</p>

  <p>"No! Impossible! Retreat! Everyone, fall back!" shouted Martin in an urgent tone.</p>

  <p>Hearing Martin shouting, Luo Zheng stopped plucking crystal cores from within the blade locust officers' chests with his knife, and asked in bewilderment, "What? Why?"</p>

  <p>"When ordinary blade locusts retreat, it means... It means that there must be..." Martin's face was white, and his fear gripped him, making him unable to finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>"What? There must be what?" Seeing the fear on Martin's face made Luo Zheng realize how dangerous the situation must be.</p>

  <p>"Queen... blade locust!" stammered Martin with a guttural grunt.</p>

  <p>He had been at the Dragon Fort for many years and knew the habits of the blade locusts, and that both the officers and the average blade locusts were under the orders of a queen blade locust. The blade locust officers could think independently, but the real commander of the army was the queen.</p>

  <p>Without independent thought, each common blade locust was a daredevil. No matter how formidable the enemy was, they wouldn't hesitate to attack, so, in general, they didn't have the concept of fleeing or retreating.</p>

  <p>In this aspect, they were natural warriors.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, since they were retreating, there must be a queen blade locust near, calling them.</p>

  <p>The queen was the sovereign mother of blade locusts. Once met, even refiners at the nature level needed to flee in haste, and only stronger refiners were able to battle her.</p>

  <p>If a queen appeared here, everyone present would surely perish.</p>

  <p>This was why Martin was so scared. In addition, he was confused about something.</p>

  <p>The daily tasks assigned to the imperial army by the Dragon Fort should not be this risky.</p>

  <p>Although the queens were frightening, there were also numerous powerful cultivators at the Dragon Fort, such as the well-known Flying Dragon General who had personally killed several blade locust queens.</p>

  <p>The imperial army did an excellent job of surveillance, and usually wouldn't assign such a dangerous task to the Green Haze Group.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was not reasonable for the Green Haze Group to be sent to such a dangerous area. 'Unless someone is using this opportunity to destroy the Green Haze Group!' thought Martin, appalled.</p>

  <p>He did not share his concerns. At the moment he just wanted to get his Green Haze Group back to the fort as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>At Martin's command, everyone stopped digging out crystal cores and headed to the fort immediately.</p>

  <p>However, just as they turned in the direction of the fort and safety, they felt a tremor in the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A massive creature was clomping closer.</p>

  <p>The noise got louder, and the ground shook more violently, telling them that the immense creature was approaching them rapidly.</p>

  <p>Hearts sank, and many soldiers and refiners alike gulped as they breathed. As predicted by Martin, a queen blade locust was indeed nearby.</p>

  <p>Everyone wanted to survive and clambered to escape, fleeing like madmen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ran at a consistent speed behind Roger, while the four disciples from the Cloud Sect complained secretly.</p>

  <p>In such a large area outside the Dragon Fort, the probability of meeting a queen blade locust was very small. Even if a queen left her nest once in a while, she would likely be beheaded by the mighty cultivators at the Dragon Fort, but unfortunately, they encountered one now...</p>

  <p>Just as the group was running through the jungle, a large red blade appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>The trees that the blade passed through were leveled, and so were the dozen soldiers in front.</p>

  <p>"Aaahh..."</p>

  <p>The soldiers were cut in half and quickly devoured by ordinary blade locusts hiding as they shrieked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Green Haze Group rushed to a halt. In front of them stood a queen blade locust over twenty feet high blocking their way. She was a bright red color, with two large blades grinding against each other, and substantial compound eyes locked firmly in her enemies.</p>

  <p>Being stared by such an enormous beast, Luo Zheng felt a chill of horror run down his spine. At that moment, he had only one thought, 'Run!'</p>

  <p>Even in this crisis, Martin didn't raise the white flag. "To the sides, as many as possible!" he roared. "Everyone, run!" The superior qualities Martin possessed as a member of the imperial army were evident at this life and death moment.</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of Martin's mouth when the queen blade locust moved again. She was huge, but she moved incredibly fast. She deftly blocked the road to the side, her two giant blades cutting across the crowd again.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, Luo Zheng leaped into the air, narrowly avoiding the blade that was coming at him and rolled over it.</p>

  <p>Others were not as fortunate. Eight more men were cut down by the blades of the queen.</p>

  <p>Standing behind the soldiers, Tank saw the giant blades bearing down on him, and it was too late for him to dodge. With a desperate yet determined look on his face, he gathered his strength and at the last moment, his entire body shimmered with a golden light.</p>

  <p>As a cultivator half-step into the nature level, he let loose a burst of remarkable power while he hung on by a thread.</p>

  <p>"Ka-Blam!"</p>

  <p>Tank focused his golden Mu Ning from within his body to a single point, and shot it at the giant blades.</p>

  <p>In a tragic scene, Tank's fierce power stopped the queen blade locust momentarily before her blades sliced him in two, mercilessly.</p>
