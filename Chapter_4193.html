<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4193 Deception </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect had the ten Holy Items to thank for their success in dissolving the other three sects in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Each Holy Item, after all, accorded exceptional power.</p>

  <p>The Evil Bead was far stronger than any Other Shore Tokens. The Space Guiding Stone could control space at will.</p>

  <p>The Limited Omnipotent Stone was even more powerful than the two others.</p>

  <p>With it, the wearer could see and know everything within a closed area.</p>

  <p>The Limited Omnipotent Stone was useless in the main world, but it could be used in the chaos and on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Only a few things could avoid the detection of the Limited Omnipotent Stone. The bubble was one of them.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit Sect had already destroyed the bubble of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. It would never reappear in the Jade Pure Realm again.</p>

  <p>Even if the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord tried to reactivate the bubble, the Snake Spirit King would now be able to detect it. The Limited Omnipotent Stone would allow him to see all, including the process of reactivating the bubble. That was why Dale could not shake off the Snake Spirit King, who had been able to track his return to the bubble last time.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, the Snake Spirit King was chafing at the disappearance of Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>He was able to be an observer before, but he realized now that was no longer the case.</p>

  <p>He cursed under his breath.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King unleashed the Space Guiding Stone's power again.</p>

  <p>The ground sank where Zheng and the others disappeared. The effect began to spread as the space in the area was squeezed.</p>

  <p>Stones turned into fine powder, then condensed into balls. They shrank until their properties were altered completely.</p>

  <p>Creatures living underground were mangled and crushed, ground into fine powder before they even knew what was happening.</p>

  <p>Cracks began to appear on the ground like a spider web, extending in all directions.</p>

  <p>Ten miles, a hundred miles, a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, everything within a thousand miles had collapsed, replaced by only a huge pit.</p>

  <p>A wise lizard at the edge of the pit had witnessed the entire thing. He stared in disbelief at the sudden crater in front of him.</p>

  <p>He was from a mighty race in the Jade Pure Realm on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>His race had survived all this time by gaining a foothold in the Jade Pure Realm despite the Treacherous Beings that overran it.</p>

  <p>His blood ran cold as it dawned on him that their home had been violently decimated just now. Everything had been destroyed in a flash.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The lizard scrambled into the pit at an extremely fast speed. All that was left there was some kind of colorful powder. He could detect no auras anywhere.</p>

  <p>The terrifying pressure had wiped out everything. It seemed even the patriarch, the eight strong warriors who could fight off resentment-level Treacherous Beings, and the prophets had all been killed.</p>

  <p>No one else had survived.</p>

  <p>The lizard started screaming in despair.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, several people materialized in front of him, glowing from the silver powder coating their bodies.</p>

  <p>The lizard fell silent, numb with shock. 'Who are these people? Where did they come from?' the lizard thought to himself, utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p>The man at the lead of the group walked toward him. The man had a smile on his face, but the lizard couldn't help but take a few steps back in apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Can you see me now?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" the lizard, who knew the human language, sputtered out.</p>

  <p>"Mysteries are more interesting, so we think it best to disappear," Zheng simply continued.</p>

  <p>"What?" The lizard was absolutely confused.</p>

  <p>Zheng bent forward and waved right in front of the lizard's eyes. As he did, he and the others slowly disappeared from the flabbergasted lizard's sight.</p>

  <p>And so too, from the Snake Spirit King's spying. The Limited Omnipotent Stone had been allowing him to see everything just now through the lizard's eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had actually been speaking to the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit King was irritated before, now he was consumed with pure wrath.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Square City began to shake.</p>

  <p>Sewell rushed to the Snake Spirit King's side.</p>

  <p>"My king, what happened?" Sewell asked.</p>

  <p>"Those people have escaped," the Snake Spirit King snarled.</p>

  <p>Sewell looked confused. "I thought letting them escape was part of your plan?"</p>

  <p>"They escaped right under my nose and out of sight of the Limited Omnipotent Stone!" the Snake Spirit King snapped.</p>

  <p>Sewell drew a sharp intake of breath and stiffened. He understood immediately, being the Snake Spirit King's capable assistant. But how could they have evaded the Limited Omnipotent Stone? What kind of abilities did they have?</p>

  <p>"Find them! Now!" the Snake Spirit King roared.</p>

  <p>Sewell promptly slithered away and into action.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before over a hundred Snake Masters and thousands of snake-shaped Treacherous Beings were deployed from the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng and his group remained on the move toward the west.</p>

  <p>The Wing King had offered to simply fly them toward their destination, but Zheng had declined.</p>

  <p>"The Space Deception Method can counter the power of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, but it is very unstable. We have to avoid using other powers of space," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>A certain level of stability had to be maintained, or else they would be exposed to the Snake Spirit King again.</p>

  <p>"After I cultivated the Blood-controlling Method, I thought my understanding of space had risen to an unreachable level. But I see it's still nothing compared to yours," the Wing King sighed.</p>

  <p>The Limited Omnipotent Stone and the Space Deception Method were theurgies that the Wing King couldn't understand.</p>

  <p>"We are fighting against an almost invincible opponent. If we can't even get rid of his monitoring, then we won't stand a chance," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord pointed out.</p>

  <p>"But you've planned for such a long time and finally have Zheng. We're already ahead on that alone," said Fuxi with a smile, optimistic as ever.</p>

  <p>Right now, they could only walk to where they needed to go, so progress was slow.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Space Deception Method was impervious not only to the powers of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, but also to all sorts of creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The group soon came across a large race as they passed through a gray area covered in stones.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the race wore masks and carried huge bone weapons.</p>

  <p>They looked strong. Such creatures should not be underestimated in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others started walking across their territory unseen. Although the creatures could sense strange auras, they couldn't determine where they were coming from. They eventually just shrugged the feeling off.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had even accidentally bumped into one of the creatures and made him stagger. But seeing nothing there, the creature simply waved it off as nothing. Soon, Zheng and his group had passed through without incident.</p>
