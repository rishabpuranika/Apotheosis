<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Flames from the hell suddenly blazed up, lightening almost half of the night sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the other two ran to the Karma Fire, breaking down branches and twigs on the way as they moved along. Even the trunks of thousand-year trees were instantly chopped into pieces by the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>As Lewis saw Luo Zheng advancing like that, the corners of his mouth twitched, 'That two are just unbelievable! They both have the consummate sword intent. Are they really from a second-rate sect?'</p>

  <p>Although Lewis was a babbling kind of guy, he was quite confident about his strength. Although he was able to come all the way there, he still had a feeling of having no advantage over Luo Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Lewis had something he was always proud of. 'If I let my power out all at a time, I may have a chance against them, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and the other two got out of the woods, they were astonished at the scene that had unveiled in front of their eyes.</p>

  <p>There was a crater with a radius of 1000 feet and was stretching outside the woods. It looked like it was caused by a fierce battle. At the middle of the crater, a blazing bright Green Lotus Karma Fire enveloped Patrick.</p>

  <p>He was fighting against a beast!</p>

  <p>The beast had two wings on its back, a horn protruding from its forehead and a face of a bear. It was standing on its two hind legs, basking in a pool of silver light.</p>

  <p>Patrick's Karma Fire was well-known in the Cloud Sect. Last time, Luo Zheng successfully threw off Patrick's Karma Fire only because of his special spiritual weapon-like body. Plus, at that time, he didn't take the Green Lotus Karma Fire head on but was simply immune to its power.</p>

  <p>However, the beast had successfully resisted the scotching Karma Fire that Patrick cast and it was even battling Patrick in the same fire!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>That beast stumped forward, raised its beefy arms, and wrestled Patrick, who already was in the Diamond-like State.</p>

  <p>With merely three blows, Patrick was sent flying out of his Karma Fire and fell heavily onto the ground. The impact caused a deep dent on the earth.</p>

  <p>"That power is quite terrifying!" Seeing that, Zheng's pupils had narrowed.</p>

  <p>'That power is probably much more formidable than when I activate all of my dragon scales!' he thought.</p>

  <p>After repelling Patrick, the beast spread its wings and made another charge at him. Obviously, this time it intended to kill Patrick.</p>

  <p>Precisely at that moment, a white figure dashed from the verge of the huge crater— it was a disciple of the Cloud Hall! Clutching a thirteen-inch long spear, that disciple flickered his wrist. Instantly, the spear weaved its way towards the beast as if it were a poisonous snake.</p>

  <p>"Fogbow streaking across the sky!"</p>

  <p>A jet of sharp spear intent shot out from the white spear as if it could pierce through anything in the world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned at the sight of the spear and its power.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! That man is really powerful!"</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Luo Zheng saw someone that powerful from Cloud Hall since he started the test.</p>

  <p>When he was taking the hidden test in the valley, he did come across a powerful opponent. That disciple was Lennon, the disciple in charge of that large magic array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know Lennon before, but still, he sensed his intimidating power. But based on Zheng's observation, Lennon was on the same level as Lewis in terms of strength. Perhaps only a mite stronger.</p>

  <p>Thus, Lennon's power was not a threat to Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>But the man fighting in the crater was different. His attack using the spear already posed a huge threat on Luo Zheng. If it were Luo Zheng who was targeted by the spear, even with his body like a high-grade spiritual weapon, he would probably be torn apart like a sheet of paper. Judging by that one strike, Luo Zheng knew that the man's power was way stronger than any of the usual Cloud Hall disciples.</p>

  <p>"That spear intent must be a consummate one!" Tianming commented.</p>

  <p>Cutters had cutter intent, the swords had sword intent, while the spears had spear intent as well.</p>

  <p>The intent attached to such weapons would improve along with the development of the relationship between the practitioner and the weapon itself. As the practitioner familiarized himself with his weapon, the weapon would also get to know its owner. Gradually, the practitioner would have a perfect command of his weapon.</p>

  <p>"He is Frank Zhuo from the Cloud Hall. It's normal for him to display that strength," Lewis noted, curling his lips.</p>

  <p>"Frank Zhuo," Luo Zheng murmured. He had always believed that on the road of pursuing the martial arts, one just had to keep going.</p>

  <p>If there was a chance to outstrip an opponent, then, he ought to do it; if the opponent was out of his league, he should work harder to catch up with him and be on his team.</p>

  <p>In fact, Tianming did the same thing. When he found he could not surpass Luo Zheng, he chose to follow Zheng's paces and try to keep up with him. If Luo Zheng scored something, he would certainly gain some achievement as well.</p>

  <p>For Tianming, it was a helpless choice, but it was indeed the smart one.</p>

  <p>Given that some people were simply born with special talents or strong physic, no one could deny the fact that there was always someone more able, perfect, and powerful in the world.</p>

  <p>Thus, whether Luo Zheng would finally outpace or follow behind Frank, one thing was for sure–he just needed to challenge Frank.</p>

  <p>However, now wasn't the right time. With so many unknown creatures attacking them as they proceeded down the Death Road, Luo Zheng was left with no choice but to help those in the same boat as him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The beast that had warded off the Green Lotus Karma Fire was hit by the spear! That white spear penetrated through the beast's arm.</p>

  <p>A ferocious look surfaced from its face and suddenly let out a deafening howl, making everyone's ears tingle.</p>
