<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite the burning gazes that Luo Zheng felt on him the moment he came out, he walked towards the Taiyi Heaven Palace with a smile.</p>

  <p>Yet, before he could take a few steps forward, a leader of the Separate Abyss race suddenly stood up and shouted in a rough voice, "Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his head and looked at the leader.</p>

  <p>He had never made a move against the Separate Abyss race in the Chaotic Source World. What did their leader want from him?</p>

  <p>"Hand over that man called the Evil God! Since he killed many of our members, we'll execute him for revenge," the leader said.</p>

  <p>The leader had to give a reasonable explanation for the death of Hamzah, and the best way to do it was to bring the Evil God back.</p>

  <p>He clearly saw that Luo Zheng had absorbed the Evil God into his inner world and did not kill him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard the leader's request, he looked slightly amused as he spoke, "The Evil God killed many people, including those from the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race, the Divine Farmer race, the Jin Wu, the Moon Spirit race, the Celestial Wolf race? He killed more than four thousand people in total. If all these races want to take revenge, how many pieces will the Evil God be chopped into?"</p>

  <p>The leader of the Separate Abyss race snorted, "I don't care about the other races. Since the Evil God killed Hamzah, we want him dead!"</p>

  <p>He walked towards Luo Zheng, his huge body blocking the warrior's path like a giant pillar.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God also killed many of our members. It seems that we should also take him back for punishment," Phoenix said with a shallow smile.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God slaughtered the members of our race. He should be punished!" a leader of the Bearing race shouted. The Chaotic Source World was known for its cruelty. Ever since ancient times, there had been countless talents who died in its territory.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Evil God was bloodthirsty and liked to kill, but he didn't violate the rules. Therefore, he shouldn't be blamed.</p>

  <p>Of course, the super forces that suffered great losses in the Chaotic Source World naturally had plans in their minds.</p>

  <p>The truth was, they were all after the Civilization Artifact that the Evil God had merged with.</p>

  <p>Now that the Separate Abyss race had stood out first, the other super forces echoed the same request.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace hadn't thought that these super forces would be so shameless as to make trouble after Luo Zheng had returned from the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe stepped out, stood in front of Luo Zheng and announced, "Everyone, have you forgotten the rules of the Chaotic Source World? Anyone who wants to reach the Chaotic Source Realm must be prepared for death!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I know the rules, but this is not the Chaotic Source World. This is the Icy Snow Province!" the leader of the Separate Abyss race sneered.</p>

  <p>It was clear that these super forces had allied with each other in order to force Luo Zheng to hand over the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that you are the big boss of the Icy Snow Province?"</p>

  <p>Yan asked coldly. It was known that the Li Shan mountain had unwillingly made the Icy Snow Province a public place.</p>

  <p>Still, it wasn't far away from the Li Shan mountain, so it was still under the Li Shan mountain's domain.</p>

  <p>These races would have to think twice if they really wanted to fight within their grounds.</p>

  <p>Since the leaders noticed that Fuxi had been away to chase after the Thunder Dimorphodon, they took the opportunity to make the request. The Separate Abyss race started first, and then the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, the Divine Farmer race, and the other races followed suit.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Separate Abyss race chuckled, "I don't know who has the final say in the Icy Snow Province. I only know that I have to bring that man named the Evil God back. Otherwise..."</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed slightly and revealed a hint of dangerous intent. Then, the auras in the bodies of the other leaders of the Separate Abyss race began to intensify, and the mountain-like pressure directly rushed towards Luo Zheng and Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>The color of Qiu Yinhe's face was drained. There was a crisp sound when he pulled out his long cyan sword, and then he declared, "If you want to fight here, I will fight to the end!"</p>

  <p>In turn, Winchell and the other mountain leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace pulled out their swords one after another as well.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace suffered the least casualties, and everyone alive had gotten enough crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they would do their best to protect Luo Zheng and fight against the enemy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the current situation made Phoenix overjoyed. If the Separate Abyss race really made a move, it would be a great opportunity for her.</p>

  <p>Her lips moved as she said something to the leaders of the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race using her life vitality.</p>

  <p>After the leaders heard her words, their lips stretched into a smile.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Feng Ge, Chaim, and the other disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace shared dreadful looks. They didn't expect that the other races would cause such a ruckus after Luo Zheng left the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>As for Yan, she wore a deep frown.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain had sent Fuxi here to take charge of the Chaotic Source World, but he had chased after the Thunder Dimorphodon and left without a trace.</p>

  <p>She thought for a while, and then she lightly turned her hand and took out a small scroll from her space ring.</p>

  <p>Although it was not convenient for the Snake Goddess to come personally, she was not the only mighty warrior in Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Just as Yan was about to activate the scroll, a mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared on the body of the leader of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>When everyone present saw the mark, they immediately felt very distressed, and looked greatly troubled.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe held Luo Zheng's hand and flew backwards. At the same time, Phoenix and the other leaders also distanced themselves from the leader of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>Even the other leaders of the Separate Abyss race themselves retreated rapidly in utter shock!</p>

  <p>The leader of the Separate Abyss race feared for his life when he saw the mark of Eight Diagrams on his body. If Fuxi gave him a palm strike, he would probably die without a complete corpse!</p>

  <p>"Well... Master Fuxi, you must have misunderstood! I just didn't know how to explain to our emperor? Please forgive me..."</p>

  <p>The emperor that the leader referred to was the current head of the Separate Abyss race, who was also one of the top masters in the Source World. The leader wanted to scare Fuxi by mentioning the emperor.</p>

  <p>While he pitifully explained himself, an invisible force suddenly enveloped him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, a huge palm imprint appeared where the leader stood. His body had turned into minced meat and was embedded into the palm imprint in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Then, the space was torn, and Fuxi walked out from it with a dark face.</p>

  <p>He was in a bad mood after the Thunder Dimorphodon had run away. When he flew back along the space channel and saw what was happening, he couldn't restrain his anger anymore.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I will be afraid of your emperor?" he hissed with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Before you entered the Chaotic Source World, I have reminded you that I won't interfere in anything within it, but if you make a move outside, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p>

  <p>Silence hung like a thick curtain at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The dead leader of the Separate Abyss race was ranked in the top five among the many leaders. Even then, he could not even survive Fuxi's palm strike. He died miserably.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Phoenix trembled with fear.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only her, but the leaders of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were all afraid as well.</p>
