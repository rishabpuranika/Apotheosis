<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1098 Determined To Protect Luo Zheng (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But the mere fact that Zheng's soul was close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm made them incredibly jealous. They didn't want to believe what they were seeing and hearing!</p>

  <p>It was similar to a story about a group of young people, all in the same age, who were in the same starting line together. Every day, they would earn the same amount of money, but occasionally, one of them would earn twice as much. Every other person would get jealous, but since that was a normal occurrence, they would just carry on and try to earn as much as the guy who earned twice.</p>

  <p>However, one day, a person suddenly appeared. This fellow was around the same age as them, and his cultivation level was also around the same as theirs. However, in the end, he had earned a hundred, even a thousand times more money than them. How could everyone accept that lying down?</p>

  <p>Despite that, they still didn't have the courage to try harder and catch up to what the new fellow had already earned.</p>

  <p>The three powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm of the Jade Martial House were more surprised at War Emperor York's words. They had seen Zheng's strength before and they knew what he was capable of. Not only did he have an outstanding level of comprehension towards the laws, but his own strength had also reached a terrifyingly high level. But now, the three of them had discovered that Zheng's soul was that powerful. Luo Zheng was indeed a flawless warrior!</p>

  <p>They then started to wonder: in the future, after he broke through and reached the Soul Sea Realm, how terrifying would his strength be?</p>

  <p>The eyes of crown prince Bram were firmly fixed on Luo Zheng. 'A soul close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm… How could this be? And why? Alas, if I could win him over, he would definitely be great help to me in the future. Unfortunately, this person has already joined Randy's team. What am I going to do?' he thought, his eyes narrowing.</p>

  <p>Today, the kings of the four divine kingdoms were present together with the crown princes and other princes from every divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>The princes who were there were all the powerful ones. They were all martial artists that were at the first tier. Some of the princes who were present were even strong enough to be ranked at the top of the first tier!</p>

  <p>These princes would eventually be important players in the game of the four divine kingdoms in the future!</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents would eventually have the opportunity to become powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, if they didn't perish.</p>

  <p>However, for these princes, there was no doubt that they would reach the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>Despite all their potential, however, each of them had suddenly felt a pang in their chests.</p>

  <p>They had been the pride of the divine kingdoms. Being the strongest warriors of the younger generation, they had steadily grown under the protection of their royal fathers. With the privilege to enjoy massive resources and practice places, their achievements and strength were several times greater than that of other warriors of the same age!</p>

  <p>But now, they felt frustrated by Zheng's shocking potential.</p>

  <p>There was a saying that "comparisons are odious". In the past, no one had been able to compete with them because they were a group of martial artists that walked at the forefront. They were the best of the best.</p>

  <p>But now, they were starting to compare themselves to Luo Zheng, and they discovered that between him and them, there was a huge disparity.</p>

  <p>'Humph, he is only strong on his soul level. He must have obtained some great lucky chance that caused a change in his soul. His own strength might not be able to withstand a single blow from me!'</p>

  <p>'I actually want to fight with this guy. It's useless just having a strong soul. I have the soul-protecting secret weapon bestowed by my royal father. I'm sure this kid wouldn't be able to hurt me!'</p>

  <p>'I'll wait and see. If this kid can defeat Logan, maybe I'll be interested in playing with him!'</p>

  <p>Thoughts ran wild inside the princes' minds, effectively drowning their self-doubts and insecurities. They couldn't afford to wallow in those thoughts.</p>

  <p>As for Lord Randy, his eyes flashed with undeterred excitement when he opened his eyes. He had long noticed that Luo Zheng was extraordinary, but he didn't expect that Zheng's soul would be so ridiculously strong. Even Lucien couldn't do anything about it. It was such a big surprise!</p>

  <p>But at the same time, he suddenly became vigilant. He sent a message to Turner through his life vitality, "Father…"</p>

  <p>How could Turner not understand what Randy wanted to say?</p>

  <p>Just now, Lucien had suddenly made a move and used his soul to attack Luo Zheng. Unexpectedly, Zheng's soul wasn't weaker than his at all.</p>

  <p>With that revelation, his intent to kill Luo Zheng became stronger than ever. If he used life vitality to crush Luo Zheng, he surely wouldn't survive. 'Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to survive!' Turner thought to himself, doubts starting to creep up on him.</p>

  <p>It would be a different case if such an extraordinary talent hadn't appeared in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. But now that he had already arrived and everyone knew of his existence, Turner had to protect him at all risks.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Turner's figure flashed and soon he was standing between Luo Zheng and War Emperor York. After a few moments of silence, he calmly said to War Emperor York, "Lucien, it's enough. As a king, don't you think it's a bit too much to attack a kid like that? It doesn't matter if he's  Luo Zheng Luo or Tianxing Luo-- he's a member of our Harlen Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>Turner looked firm as he said this. The meaning behind his words was crystal clear. It didn't matter if Luo Zheng had killed the prince of York Divine Kingdom or not - Turner was determined to protect him at all cost!</p>
