<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every Eternal Realm warrior that could enter the Supreme Pure Realm had their own unique methods.</p>

  <p>So it wasn't surprising that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had grasped a secret that the Element Spirit Civilization had never mastered.</p>

  <p>Once again, Slade stretched out his hand and marked an area in the north of the Grand Pure Realm on the map, saying, "They will have to pass through here on their way to the Whining Road."</p>

  <p>Claire squinted at the map. "It's the territory of the Mystical Void race."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Les asked.</p>

  <p>"Send some people to frighten the creatures of the Mystical Void race, and this area will be completely sealed," said Slade unhurriedly. "Once the creatures of the Mystical Void race seal this space, they can only choose to pass the Purple Wind Gorge."</p>

  <p>Claire looked calculative at Slade's words before asking, "The Purple Wind Gorge is about to get windy?"</p>

  <p>Slade said in an emotionless voice, "Yes. Ninety-nine days form one period, and after this period of time passes, the wind will start again."</p>

  <p>"If there is a gust of wind, they will be stuck in the Purple Wind Gorge. Zheng is powerful, but he might not be able to survive in face of so many warriors from different races in the Grand Pure Realm laying siege around him!"</p>

  <p>Claire's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Slade burst out into emotionless laughter.</p>

  <p>"You may be proud but please don't laugh like a maniac!" Les muttered, irritated.</p>

  <p>Slade was not an individual. When the many members of the Element Spirit race expressed their feelings through him, it was like a torture to Les.</p>

  <p>There was a wide passage at the bottom of the Dual Topknot Mountain.</p>

  <p>This passage was in the north of the Grand Pure Realm and was called the Silent Path by the members of various races.</p>

  <p>The Silent Path was safe. As long as one followed the rules, they wouldn't be attacked or be in danger.</p>

  <p>But as the name of the passage suggested, people had to keep absolutely silent while passing through the Silent Path and not make any sound.</p>

  <p>Silence was the biggest rule here.</p>

  <p>A few fist-sized creatures floated in the air along the Silent Path. These creatures were shaped like jellyfish, looked cottony, and were light as air.</p>

  <p>They floated in every corner of the Silent Path at all times of the day.</p>

  <p>These white flocculent creatures belonged to the Mystical Void race.</p>

  <p>The Mystical Void creatures weren't all that intelligent. They fed on space and never contacted the outside world. It was difficult for people from the outside world to capture or interfere with them.</p>

  <p>Some even maintained that the members of the Mystical Void race were not living beings, but just another form of space.</p>

  <p>The biggest weakness of the Mystical Void race was their cowardice. Any loud noise would spook them and they'd immediately transform from the flocculent form into the space form.</p>

  <p>In their space form, they were compressed together and had once crushed many warriors of different races into dust. Only a small number of people could still walk out of the Silent Path after provoking the Mystical Void race.</p>

  <p>After Slade gave the order, six nonhuman warriors arrived at the Silent Path.</p>

  <p>They were silent as they flew along the Silent Path.</p>

  <p id="top_7">Every dozens of miles, they had placed a silver tube that looked like a whistle on the ground. This way, there were a large number of tubes along the way.</p>

  <p>They had walked through the entire Silent Path when one of the warriors reached out a hand and gently pressed the tube at the end.</p>

  <p>The silver tube suddenly began to whistle a harsh, keening sound.</p>

  <p>The Silent Path was eerily quiet, and the sudden whistling sound was particularly shrill and loud.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>A creature of the Mystical Void race above the silver tube shook violently, its cotton-like body beginning to expand and turning into a milky white space that expanded in all directions.</p>

  <p>The space grew larger by ten times, a thousand times, a million times!</p>

  <p>As the space expanded, it crashed into the bodies of the six warriors, sending them flying.</p>

  <p>The silver tubes in the Silent Path began to whistle in unison, the sound even louder than before.</p>

  <p>The usually quiet Silent Path became so noisy that almost all the members of the Mystical Void race were surprised. Their bodies began to swell and they began to turn into the space forms.</p>

  <p>These huge spaces squeezed and merged with each other.</p>

  <p>It looked like countless bubbles merging together, forming a peculiar golden color.</p>

  <p>When the six warriors stood up from the ground and saw this, their hearts still fluttered with fear.</p>

  <p>If they remained in the Silent Path, they would be squeezed into meat paste by these space bubbles.</p>

  <p>When the members of the Mystical Void race were frightened, they'd become like this for a full month, which meant that the Silent Path would be closed for a month and that the task that Slade had given to the six warriors could be considered completed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine emerged from the ground like a snake and dived back into the ground. This happened multiple times, completely destroying the soil along the way.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked back through the heavenly eye, frowning.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine was fast and moved in a rather extraordinary manner. But the warriors of various races weren't any slower. More and more warriors had gathered in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>These warriors followed it all the way but couldn't catch up soon enough.</p>

  <p>But they would besiege Zheng and his companions if they were to be intercepted.</p>

  <p>"How soon will we arrive at the Whining Road?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess took some time to calculate it all and replied, "It's not far from here. There should be around a hundred thousand miles before we reach it. Everything will be fine as long as we pass through the Silent Path."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better speed up," Zheng said to the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine whined and complained, "I'm moving at the highest speed!"</p>

  <p>Zheng merely stared at it, ice in his gaze, and the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled. It frantically activated its own strength and sped up.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine had just caught a steady faster speed when an invisible space wall hit it with an almighty bang.</p>

  <p>Under such great inertia, Zheng, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others slammed into the space wall.</p>

  <p>Logic dictated that it was impossible to not notice the space wall before them, given everyone's powerful perceptions. But they were now caught off guard, crashing unceremoniously into it.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, a big deal for the Eternal Realm warriors present.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood firm, frowning and slapping the space wall with his hands.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The space wall broke with a resounding crack.</p>

  <p>He smashed the space wall, causing a phantom-like figure to charge at him.</p>

  <p>This was an Eternal Realm warrior who had come from the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't hesitate and landed a blow on the man's head.</p>

  <p>No one in the Grand Pure Realm could withstand his punch. Not even the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't expected the opponent to not dodge his attack. Instead, the warrior launched a palm strike towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death," Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>He could feel that something was wrong, but he still chose to fight back.</p>

  <p>The moment his fist and the opponent's palm met, he felt the softness of his opponent's palm, and could not find any area of the palm to apply his force.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The man laughed, his entire body collapsing into spider threads and wrapping around Zheng's entire body.</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted to struggle against the spider threads, but although they were thin and soft, they couldn't be broken or pulled apart.</p>

  <p>It was then that two more people appeared on the ground. These were identical twins and were also at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>They held hands face to face, and a black hole appeared between them. The hole erupted with great magnetic force and sucked Zheng into it.</p>
