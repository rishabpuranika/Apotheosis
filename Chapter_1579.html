  <p>
</p>

  <p>Undeniably, Luo Luo Zheng had not been entirely successful.</p>

  <p>During his fight with Lucille, she had struck out with her palm, drawing out a magnetic power thousands of times stronger than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just now suppressed the laws of five elements and forcefully extracted the magnetic power...</p>

  <p>He was able to draw out a strand of the magnetic power after only three trials. Lucille would probably have been stupefied if she had witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>That had been too rapid by far...</p>

  <p>In her time, she had been sent to Magnetic Sacred Mountain by the patriarch of the Ji Clan to cultivate for three years!</p>

  <p>She had only managed to extract a sliver of the magnetic power at the end of the second year, but Luo Luo Zheng had merely spent an hour on the entire process.</p>

  <p>The woman in white was a core disciple of another large clan in the Thoughtless Minds and was only second to the ace talents. She had known how intimidating the ace talents were from a young age.</p>

  <p>Among other warriors of age, Lucille was like a proud phoenix, always superior to the others. She was cared for and doted by her elders at all times. The strength that Lucille displayed far surpassed that of her friends and peers.</p>

  <p>The woman in white was naturally unwilling to be inferior to Lucille.</p>

  <p>The difference in their talent levels troubled her. In secret, she had worked hard in her cultivation, trying to close the chasm between her and Lucille. She had made up her mind to surpass Lucille, come hell or high water. However, despite her ambitions, she still had a grasp on reality. There were warriors in this world who were far different from her. Even if she worked harder, the gap between her and Lucille might only become larger...</p>

  <p>This was the strength of the ace talent.</p>

  <p>As an ace talent, Lucille had spent six years only mastering this secret skill. However, it only took Luo Luo Zheng some minutes to start to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>Was he a monster?</p>

  <p>The woman was curious to see how much of the clan's secret skill Luo Luo Zheng could comprehend in the short time, but Luo Luo Zheng had put away the Magnetic Sacred Mountain for the moment...</p>

  <p>It was not that Luo Luo Zheng was unwilling to continue cultivating, but fighting was prohibited in this room. Drawing out even a stream of that magnetic power would come to waste.</p>

  <p>After putting away the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng did not stop cultivating. He continuously used chaotic energy to transform the five types of Law Power in his palm, seeking that sense of balance.</p>

  <p>Only after the five types of Law Power were fully balanced could he employ the magnetic power with ease.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a thin line became visible on one of the walls in the room. The line appeared on a corner and then spread. After spreading for about seven feet on the wall, it turned to a right angle, forming the outline of a door.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>The entire door began to glow. Not long after, it was pushed open.</p>

  <p>A warrior entered in the passageway.</p>

  <p>"The sixth warrior..."</p>

  <p>The crowd stared at the visitor, their eyes flashing with curiosity.</p>

  <p>He was also a human warrior.</p>

  <p>He wore a round hat and appeared to be arrogant. When he noticed the gazes of the people nearby, he snorted maliciously. "Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something drawn on my face?"</p>

  <p>The warriors who could collect iron tickets and receive five million Illusion Points were considered to be remarkable. They could be successors of world lords or top warriors of sacred places. The warrior such as the human who had just entered the room was usually labelled as being very ordinary.</p>

  <p>As the woman in white and the other two human warriors registered what the intruder in the round hat said, they remained calm. Silently, they judged him in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a small smile on his face. He still concentrated on controlling the balance of the five different powers in his palm and easily ignored the human warrior with the round hat.</p>

  <p>But the ogre warrior seemed displeased by the human warrior's words.</p>

  <p>He did not intend to cause the newcomer any trouble, but he wished the human did not speak so rudely.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Come closer! I want to look at you," the ogre warrior said.</p>

  <p>"You dare to look at me?" the warrior with the round hat said, glaring at the ogre warrior.</p>

  <p>"Of course I dare to look at you! So what?" the ogre said with some irritation.</p>

  <p>"If you continue to stare at me like that, I will..."</p>

  <p>Hearing this pointless conversation between the human and the ogre warrior, Luo Luo Zheng, the woman in white and the other two warriors could not help but roll their eyes.</p>

  <p>They knew the rule of this room? fighting was prohibited. As talents of the Soul Sea Realm, why were these two engaging in a futile quarrel? It was senseless.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior's voice was sonorous. As he argued with the warrior with the round hat, his voice echoed in the room. The room was not so big, so it indeed got noisy.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng did not mind it. He focused all his attention on the power of the five elements on his fingers, as if he could not hear the argument around him.</p>

  <p>The woman in white frowned, her face livid. The other two human warriors also looked annoyed.</p>

  <p>"If you two continue quarreling, I will kill you two after we leave this room!" the short human warrior finally shouted, unable to bear it any longer.</p>

  <p>As the short warrior said this, he extended his hand. A short sword floated in the air toward him.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the sword was ordinary, but there was a unique inscription on its blade. A faint golden light emitted from the blade and within the light were a few incomplete Sanskrit characters.</p>

  <p>As the new human warrior and the ogre warrior, previously engaged in a squabble, saw the short sword, they were a bit stunned. Their faces betrayed their surprise.</p>

  <p>"Is this the supreme divine weapon? the Buddha Curse Blade?" The warrior with the round hat stared at the short warrior. "You are a cultivator of the Blessed Buddha Land, correct?"</p>

  <p>More than three thousand supreme divine weapons existed in the entire universe and many warriors had them memorized. Although the warrior with the round hat had never seen this short sword before, he had already guessed at its origin from its Mu Ning and appearance.</p>

  <p>Buddha Curse Blade...</p>

  <p>People could get killed if Buddha cursed them with a few words.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Curse Blade contained a very strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>It was the most famous weapon in the entirety of the Blessed Buddha Land and was the ultimate treasure of the Black-faced Buddha House.</p>

  <p>The short warrior must be extraordinary, for he was able to bring the short sword to the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors in the Blessed Buddha Land were monks. Naturally, they all wore monastic robes and were without hair.</p>

  <p>However, not all were like this. The Blessed Buddha Land was considered to be the sacred place of Buddhism, but some people who went there to cultivate were not required to obey all the rules of the land.</p>

  <p>The woman in white glanced at the short warrior's sword, her face placid. Although a supreme divine weapon was rare, it was not enough to intimidate her...</p>

  <p>The Buddha Curse Blade?</p>

  <p>Hearing the others talk about the supreme divine weapon, Luo Luo Zheng could not help but quickly glance at the short sword. Once again, he turned all his attention to the power of the five elements in his palm.</p>

  <p>Revealing the sword seemed to have left quite an impression about the short warrior.</p>

  <p>The warrior with the round hat realized that the short warrior before him was indeed formidable. He hastily tried to cover his face with the brim of his hat and moved to a corner of the room.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior's eyes were still provoking, but he did not shout anymore...</p>

  <p>After the entry of the warrior with the round hat, another thin line appeared on another wall. Another door opened.</p>

  <p>The seventh warrior entered the room.</p>

  <p>She was a woman from the Demon Night. Without causing any disturbance, she glanced at everyone in the room and kept her back against the wall, maintaining an upright posture. She took out a long arrow from her bag and ceaselessly traced the bright arrowhead with her fingers.</p>

  <p>Quite a few warriors in this supreme world had obtained iron tickets, and they were all attentive of the others who had them too.</p>

  <p>Most of them hesitated before using the iron tickets. After all, it cost them five million Illusion Points to enter the Hall of Causality, which meant that they chose to part reluctantly with what they treasured.</p>

  <p>However, as more and more warriors entered the Hall of Causality, some of the warriors who had been hesitating outside grew more resolute.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors in the room increased rapidly.</p>

  <p>Less than three minutes after the Demon Night woman entered the room, another door was pushed open.</p>

  <p>The eighth warrior...</p>

  <p>It was an ogre warrior.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, another door opened.</p>

  <p>The ninth warrior...</p>

  <p>The tenth warrior!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had waited in the room for about half a day, and now ten people were finally gathered here.</p>

  <p>"All of us are here now." The woman in white smiled, stood up, and then said to Luo Luo Zheng, "All right, we can set out now."</p>

  <p>The woman did not give off an air of hostility. She was instead very polite to Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Luo Zheng smiled back. "But there's no door in this room. Which direction should we go in now?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to move at all. Just stand where you are," the woman in white replied.</p>

  <p>Right after this, the walls around the room collapsed with a loud bang, giving way to the outside...</p>
