  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back then, the Grandmaster of Heaven had made a contract with Othniel using the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.</p>

  <p>According to the contract, he would not attack Othniel before taking down Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the contract didn't mention anything about Herbert.</p>

  <p>Now that he had taken advantage of Herbert to capture the people of Li Shan mountain and possessed the same abilities as the latter, Herbert no longer had any value to him. "What do you mean by doing so, Grandmaster of Heaven?"</p>

  <p>Herbert's face darkened.</p>

  <p>He already felt that he had gotten quite weaker in the Lawless Cage.</p>

  <p>If he completely lost control of the Lawless Cage, then the Grandmaster of Heaven could do anything to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm eliminating my future enemies in advance. Is there anything wrong about that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven stated matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>As the head of the Nihility race, the Grandmaster of Heaven was one of the Element Spirit Civilization's mortal enemies. It was inevitable for him to confront Herbert.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Herbert's body began to glow brightly as he tried hard to activate his bloodline power.</p>

  <p>As the powerful energy surged in his body, the purple pillars also began to glow. It was clear that he was scrambling for control over the Lawless Cage.</p>

  <p>If he was still outside the Lawless Cage, he could've probably defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven with his excellent understanding of the truth power.</p>

  <p>But now, the Lawless Cage greatly limited his strength. His struggle only lasted for a few seconds before victory was declared.</p>

  <p>In the end, he had to admit defeat to the Grandmaster of Heaven. "As the leader of the Nihility race, you are shameful to be such a treacherous man!"</p>

  <p>Herbert snapped resentfully.</p>

  <p>"I never swore anything to you. What made me treacherous?" the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"You..." At that point, Herbert was too angry to speak anymore.</p>

  <p>Unlike the other Chaos Ancient Gods, he rarely traveled around the mortal world. Thus, he didn't know about such lies and deceit.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization are all the same. They only come to you when they need something from you, then they will kill you the moment you're of no use to them. I tried to convince you before, but you ignored my words like nothing!" Fuxi suddenly shouted from the side.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had lent his body to the real Fuxi, but he still got detained in the end.</p>

  <p>Still, he didn't blame it on the real Fuxi.</p>

  <p>After all, things might have ended up worse if he had personally fought in the battle.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Herbert also got incarcerated in the Lawless Cage, he couldn't help but grab control of his body again so he could sneer at Herbert.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had almost won Herbert over to their side. However, the latter finally believed other people's lies and chose to follow the Purge Way.</p>

  <p>As for Herbert, he was enraged at first, but expressed mockery upon hearing Fuxi's words. "Isn't Li Shan mountain the leader of the Finale Way? You thought you were right and justified, but all of you just ended up like me!" he retorted.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, and Judson, all felt downhearted.</p>

  <p>The end of chaos would bring about destruction sooner or later.</p>

  <p>The chaos had already experienced many ends now. When the ends of the previous rounds of chaos came, people still had a chance to fight back. In this round, however, they didn't even get to try. It was truly pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Even if we can't complete the Finale Way in this round of chaos, we will have another chance in the next round," Fuxi shot back.</p>

  <p>Herbert laughed and pointed towards the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Now that victory belongs to him and the Nihility race, do you think there will be another round of chaos?" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi glanced at the Grandmaster of Heaven, and he finally felt hopeless.</p>

  <p>He and the Snake Goddess knew their mission very well ever since the establishment of Li Shan mountain. The Finale Way remained engraved in their bones, and they were not afraid to sacrifice themselves for it.</p>

  <p>He believed that after many rounds of chaos, a noble hero would emerge and lead them to their victory.</p>

  <p>If they could not do it after trying one thousand times, then they would try ten thousand times. If they could not do it after trying ten thousand times, then one hundred thousand times.</p>

  <p>Besides, time was quite cheap compared to their eternal cause. As long as it was still possible to complete the Finale Way, they would eventually succeed after countless attempts. That was Fuxi's belief.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, he realized that he had underestimated the Nihility race. They were simply a group of insane monsters!</p>

  <p>The most incredible thing about it all was that the leader of the Nihility race was a real human! "You? Why did you choose the Nihility Way?" Fuxi raised his head and asked.</p>

  <p>The connection between the Grandmaster of Heaven and the 77th civilization was clear to the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess, but not to him.</p>

  <p>"You are just a replica. It's meaningless for you to know much," the Grandmaster of Heaven said indifferently. "You just need to know that if you want to live, you have to submit to me!" he declared.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he shook his long sleeve then a black ship came out of it.</p>

  <p>The captain of the Black Ship leaped out from the bow and simultaneously activated the Wild God Body. Then, he summoned the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.</p>

  <p>"Make your vow before the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake. If you submit to the Grandmaster of Heaven and join the Nihility race, you can live," said the captain.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, not even a Chaos Ancient God could escape the restrictions of such contracts. Once they took an oath, they had to follow it all their lives.</p>

  <p>"If you refuse, I'll send you to hell," the Grandmaster of Heaven stated in a deathly calm voice as if he didn't care about their choices at all.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Judson, Gerald and Herbert all fell silent.</p>

  <p>Warriors at their level could afford to accept death, but they still had to consider their companions' situations if they died.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, defeat in this war would probably cost Li Shan mountain everything.</p>

  <p>"My time is limited," the Grandmaster of Heaven chirped as he gently brandished the Cyan Misty Sword. Cyan sword radiance mixed with black fire swayed on the edge of the weapon.</p>

  <p>This battle only eliminated Li Shan mountain's forces, and the Grandmaster of Heaven knew he hadn't won the final victory yet. Next, he had to deal with the Element Spirit Civilization. The battle against them might take place in the chaos or the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Since no one had spoken yet, he shot the cyan sword radiance at them.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The strike punctured all of their chests, and black flames burned hotly in their wounds.</p>

  <p>Although such injuries weren't enough to kill them, the black fire still felt like torture. Everyone's faces twisted in pain.</p>

  <p>However, even though the black fire burned continuously, all of them in the Lawless Cage endured it silently without yielding.</p>

  <p>"I only want to recruit more men in the chaos who could be of use to me, but it looks like you are all strong-willed people. Since you refuse to join me, let me send you to hell."</p>

  <p>With a murderous glint, the Grandmaster of Heaven waved his hand, and the entire Lawless Cage began to shrink rapidly.</p>

  <p>The distance between the purple pillars continued to lessen, while the pressure inside the cage increased.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others still tried hard to resist the black fire, but they had quite a hard time now that the Lawless Cage was also shrinking.</p>

  <p>As they became increasingly powerless to resist, the black fire burned more and more wildly on their bodies and brought death closer to them.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, a golden sword radiance crossed a vast distance and slashed squarely on the Lawless Cage.</p>

  <p>The mighty golden sword radiance was powerful enough to go against the Grandmaster of Heaven's cyan sword radiance. Its attack rocked the entire Lawless Cage quite violently, which weakened the cage's restraints.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Snake Goddess and the others inside it had a chance to breathe.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven raised his head and looked at the figure in the far end of the horizon. He had thought that it would be Othniel who came out of the battleground victoriously, but that was not the case.</p>
