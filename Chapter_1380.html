  <p>
</p>

  <p>Layla tried to find out where Zheng was before she left the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>However, in the face of the boundless Law Storm, she naturally couldn't know where Zheng was or whether he had even been eliminated from the test already.</p>

  <p>"So Zheng reached the 18, 000th mile, right?"</p>

  <p>Layla smiled. Even though she had left the Enchanted Barrier Tower before him, she was confident with what she had achieved. She knew that there was no way Zheng would be able to beat her record.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, 28, 200 miles was the best she could do.</p>

  <p>After reaching the 28, 200th mile, Leila could feel the pressure.</p>

  <p>The Law Storm could only be described as terrifying. The power of both thunder and fire mixed together, the extremely compressed wind blades, and the frost that could freeze anything...</p>

  <p>If Layla had tried to push herself and realize her full potential, she might have been able to travel another thousand miles further.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't think it was worth it. She believed she did her best and people were already impressed enough with her.</p>

  <p>It was more than enough for her that she had beaten ordinary warriors and the talented ones too. She could proudly hold her head high in front of anyone including Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was so satisfying to see the astounded looks of all those warriors from the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but feel fulfilled as everyone looked at her with much respect and admiration.</p>

  <p>"Layla, please come upstairs," she heard Yolande's voice calling for her.</p>

  <p>Layla nodded lightly in response. Her embroidered shoes clattered on the floor as her small figure floated over so that she was in front of all the leaders.</p>

  <p>Before, these leaders never really paid that much attention to Layla.</p>

  <p>They were all powerful warriors that were qualified to be world lords and were regarded with prestige.</p>

  <p>Layla was just a junior compared to them. She was much inferior in terms of age and her cultivation base.</p>

  <p>But after what they had just witnessed, they regarded her now with respect and admiration.</p>

  <p>Even standing in front of these powerful figures, Layla wasn't nervous at all. Instead, she turned to the old man wearing a cotton robe and asked,</p>

  <p>"If there's a reward for crossing 10, 000 miles, shouldn't there be a reward too for crossing 20, 000 miles?"</p>

  <p>The old man was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>He'd never considered before that someone could reach 20, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>So he hadn't prepared a reward for such an achievement.</p>

  <p>One of the leaders said with a smile, "There should be a reward for her!</p>

  <p>28, 000 miles. That's amazing! She deserves the best reward!"</p>

  <p>"I agree! She should get a reward at least for the new record she has set!" another one chimed in.</p>

  <p>The old man hesitated for a moment. What reward would be proper? He had trouble figuring it out.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard a faint voice, "I will give this reward to you."</p>

  <p>The leaders of the palaces were stunned when they heard that voice.</p>

  <p>They then saw a person passing through the barrier that the old man had placed. He was descending slowly towards them.</p>

  <p>"The lord of the Sunset World!"</p>

  <p>"What an honor to see you here!"</p>

  <p>When they recognized who it was, they all stood up from their seats to greet him. They all looked at him with much respect.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the leaders of the thirteen palaces were all considered important figures in the supreme worlds near the alliance.</p>

  <p>For example, even though Yolande wasn't a world lord, the world lord of the Spirit Reading World treated her with respect when she went there for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, all world lords enjoyed the status and respect.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World had an extremely high status in the alliance. He was a core member even among all world lords, and he alone controlled the thirteen palaces' supreme worlds. His status was only second to that of the Supreme Lords, and only a few other world lords enjoyed the same status.</p>

  <p>While everyone regarded the lord of the Sunset World with respect, Layla didn't seem like she could be bothered to show any respect for him. After all, she only cared about her reward.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the world lord's words, Layla excitedly asked, "So you'll give me the reward, right?"</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World nodded and looked at her kindly. "Yes, little girl."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a little girl. My name is Layla!" Layla corrected him impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Okay, Layla," the lord of the Sunset World was amused. He cleared his throat, a bit embarrassed and then added, "I was in a hurry so I wasn't able to prepare anything. However, I have three treasures with me, each of which can be considered a good reward for you. You can choose one."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, the lord of the Sunset World waved his hand and three masses of light appeared out of nowhere in front of him.</p>

  <p>There was a precious treasure within each of them.</p>

  <p>Two of the treasures were first rank divine weapons: a snow-white sword and a light yellow saber.</p>

  <p>The last one was a feather robe which was only a secondary first-rank divine weapon. However, since there were very few defensive weapons, this made the feather robe as valuable as the other treasures.</p>

  <p>"The first two divine weapons are both ranked on the Universe Spirit Tablet. Although their rankings are very low, they are still far more powerful than any ordinary first-rank divine weapons. As for this feather robe, it is a defensive treasure that I unintentionally obtained," the world lord explained.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Layla didn't hesitate at all and immediately pointed at the feather robe.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you're choosing the robe?" The lord of the Sunset World asked in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Layla answered firmly, "It's the only one that looks nice!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the leaders scratched their heads in confusion. Every treasure on the Universe Spirit Tablet was extremely valuable but Layla wasn't interested in them simply because they didn't look nice. It was as if she didn't care about the treasures' real value.</p>

  <p>While the feather robe did look nice, it was extremely light and its surface reflected a variety of colors and patterns. It gave off an ethereal feeling. However, even then, most warriors would consider functionality above all especially given a special opportunity as this. Very few warriors would choose their weapon based on appearance alone.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World nodded and then he did some sort of gesture. The light containing the robe floated towards Layla who then reached out to the mass of light and grabbed the gorgeous feather robe. It took her only a flick of the hand to wear the robe.</p>

  <p>She proudly spun around on her tiptoes making sure to be graceful still.</p>

  <p>She'd always taken pride in her achievements.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World then continued, "Now that she has reached such a distance, the Spring Fragrance Pavilion might send people to recruit her very soon. I wonder how Kyron will respond to it."</p>

  <p>Yolande sized up the lively young girl and then answered, "Since Kyron has sent her here to undergo the assessment of Passing the Torch, he must have thought about this. I think he won't refuse the Spring Fragrance Pavilion."</p>

  <p>"That's good." The lord of the Sunset World nodded. He suddenly turned to the Enchanted Barrier Tower, a curious look on his face. "Is there still someone inside the tower?"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded, "Yes. It's a warrior from my Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The lord of the Sunset World took a careful look and said with a slightly surprised voice, "He has reached the 18, 000th mile. That's not bad."</p>

  <p>In fact, 18, 000 miles was not bad at all because it was excellent. This was Supreme Lord Illusion's record back then. Plus, Zheng was actually at 18, 300 miles already which meant that he had already broken Supreme Lord Illusion's record.</p>

  <p>This achievement was far from 'not bad.'</p>

  <p>However, since Layla had just set a record of 28, 000 miles which was 10, 000 miles ahead of Zheng, Zheng's achievement suddenly paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>Yolande discreetly pursed her lips and said, "Zheng seems to be meditating.</p>

  <p>I think he's still going to go farther."</p>

  <p>Yolande couldn't be sure. She had guessed that Zheng would beat Supreme Lord Illusion's record and she had turned out to be right.</p>

  <p>However, she wasn't sure how far Zheng could actually reach. She could only make a conservative estimate.</p>

  <p>Layla also looked towards the Enchanted Barrier Tower and said with a smile, "I agree! Zheng's achievement is already great! He might go a bit farther and he might even reach the 20, 000 miles' mark!"</p>

  <p>Yolande shot her an annoyed glance. She disliked Layla for her arrogance. Layla seemed to doubt that Zheng could break her record.</p>

  <p>Yolande secretly hoped that Zheng would beat her. However, she knew how difficult it was to break the astonishing record that Layla had just set. For some reason, she felt upset about this.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World said, "Let's just see if this boy will surprise us. If he can reach the 20, 000 miles' mark, I will also give him my reward. I just wonder how long he's going to meditate there. It's a bit difficult to meditate inside the Law Storm, after all."</p>

  <p>The crowd then fell into silence as they observed the last person in the Enchanted Barrier Tower. Zheng hadn't moved in a while and everyone was wondering how long this would last.</p>
