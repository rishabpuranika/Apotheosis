</p>

  <p>It would take the Equality Altar some time to remove the Strength Equalizing Theurgy completely.</p>

  <p>It took about nine seconds for the orange dots to disperse from the Equality Altar and spread to Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>But those nine seconds were enough for Spark.</p>

  <p>Now that the constraint on his body had been cast off and he finally regained his strength, the power began to disperse.</p>

  <p>If an Other Shore Realm warrior went out to fight, it wouldn't be a challenge to kill countless mortals.</p>

  <p>Spark let out a roar of fury as his body started to swell up, eventually turning into a giant that was four million feet tall.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Eight flashes of dragon-shaped lightning furiously circled him.</p>

  <p>Spark felt immense joy as he thought of those men dying in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Emily, Timotheus, all the exiles, and the Warden race members, you all should go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Spark reached out his hand and tapped the air.</p>

  <p>The eight flashes of dragon-shaped lightning circled each other, and then poured towards the warriors who were busy fighting.</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone was confused.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Warden race with a walking stick and a bent body let out a faint sigh.</p>

  <p>A huge wave of helplessness struck him.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to think about how Spark would manage to break the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>The Warden race was on the verge of falling down. Even if the tomb keeper had defeated two of the most powerful intruders, it didn't help ease the situation.</p>

  <p>The leader also couldn't ask the tomb keeper to do more for them.</p>

  <p>They were running out of options. Doing anything at all was useless.</p>

  <p>The massive power had intimidated even Emily, Timotheus, and the other exiles. When they saw Spark, their eyes were filled with nothing but resentment.</p>

  <p>Letting Spark escape before was a terrible idea. No one had thought he would do such a thing.</p>

  <p>The eight flashes of dragon-shaped lightning had approached in just a blink of an eye. With the explosive sound of lightning, everyone's eardrums were shattered, and their ears began to bleed.</p>

  <p>After all, they were just mere mortals. That kind of power was more than enough to wipe them all out.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile crept up on Zheng's face as he witnessed the scene from the ground.</p>

  <p>He never thought everyone would just die after fighting for so long.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper stood beside Zheng, looking at the gruesome view with his mouth slightly open.</p>

  <p>He also never expected such a thing to happen.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. I was careless!"</p>

  <p>If only there was no Strength Equalizing Theurgy, Spark would've been easier to take down. He didn't even take all the exiles seriously, not to mention Spark.</p>

  <p>At that time, orange light spots still fluttered slowly from a distance.</p>

  <p>Without his cultivation base, the dragon-shaped lightning could directly devour him.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper wasn't any ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>He was one of the few most powerful warriors in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Strength Equalizing Theurgy belonged to the truth theurgy.</p>

  <p>Although it had suppressed him a lot, he still had a way to hold out against it.</p>

  <p>At that crucial moment of life and death, the tomb keeper grew serious.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Blood textures then spread on his face like bright clouds.</p>

  <p>At the same time, blue veins began to emerge on the surfaces of his body. He struggled for a little bit, and then...</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Streaks of blue light leaked out of his body.</p>

  <p>When Zheng, who was still on the ground, noticed the changes happening with the tomb keeper, his eyes widened.</p>

  <p>It was those blue lights that affected everyone's cultivation base.</p>

  <p>The blue dots might represent the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>That fellow was actually able to resist that theurgy and had managed to force the blue dots out of his body.</p>

  <p>The Strength Equalizing Theurgy was arranged by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng realize how powerful the tomb keeper really was.</p>

  <p>It didn't surprise him why he lost to the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>After all the blue light dots were forced out, the tomb keeper's aura also drastically changed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the eight flashes of dragon-shaped lightning glided over.</p>

  <p>The waves caused by the lightning gushed over, and the houses on both sides of the road began to collapse.</p>

  <p>The exiles and the members of the Warden race were directly annihilated by the dragon-shaped lightning. The attack left no room for resistance or avoidance.</p>

  <p>The lightning continued to extend all the way to the front of the tomb keeper. He slightly stretched out his hand and pointed a finger to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't feel any kind of special energy being used by the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>However, the eight flashes of dragon-shaped lightning failed to move further.</p>

  <p>An invisible shield stood in front of the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>Those bolts of lightning followed the direction where the tomb keeper's finger was pointed. All of them went straight to the ground.</p>

  <p>'Is he able to control others' powers?' Zheng thought, obviously dumbfounded by what he had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>The eight bolts of lightning continued to descend, causing a huge, deep crater in the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng flopped himself on the edge of the huge crater as if he was lying on the side of a cliff.</p>

  <p>Spark was filled with confidence when he launched this attack.</p>

  <p>He believed that no one was going to resist such power even if he used only a little bit of it.</p>

  <p>However, something groundbreaking had occurred.</p>

  <p>Someone not only blocked his attack but also took his strength away.</p>

  <p>How was that possible?</p>

  <p>Even though Emily regained her strength, she couldn't do something like that.</p>

  <p>Spark narrowed his eyes and glared at the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Spark asked.</p>

  <p>His voice was loud, but only the tomb keeper could hear it as everyone else's eardrums had been shattered.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think you have the right to know that?" the tomb keeper said casually, raising his arm to point mockingly at Spark.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, he was more displeased than before.</p>

  <p>He helped the Warden race with the battle and even fought Zheng. He was very relaxed amidst all those events.</p>

  <p>To him, those were just a touch of spice for his boring life.</p>

  <p>However, Spark suddenly broke the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, forcing the tomb keeper to break free from restraint of this theurgy by himself.</p>

  <p>Even for the tomb keeper, putting up a fight against the Chaos Ancient God wasn't going to be a walk in the park. He would have to pay a huge price if he did such a thing.</p>

  <p>That annoyed the tomb keeper to a great extent. He had wasted so much over a nobody like Spark.</p>

  <p>All he wanted was to tear Spark into pieces.</p>

  <p>When the tomb keeper smacked the air, an invisible hand struck Spark pretty hard.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Spark felt an uncontrollable force crushing his body that stood four million feet high. The sound of his bones cracking was as loud as thunderclaps.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Spark's huge head was crushed flat even before he could get rid of the Wild God body.</p>

  <p>His huge body collapsed, resembling a mountain that was caving in.</p>

  <p>After his spiritual soul was obliterated, the Wild God Power began to quickly evaporate. His huge body continued to shrink into pieces until all of it disappeared right before everyone's very eyes.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until then that the orange dots slowly drifted into everyone's body.</p>
