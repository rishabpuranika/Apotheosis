  <p>
</p>

  <p>To the west of the Dark Region was the Splendid Jade Mountain, and within it was a mountain pass.</p>

  <p>Behind the pass was the Royal Monkey race's territory.</p>

  <p>It was naturally impossible for the Insect Masters to get through this smoothly.</p>

  <p>Ten miles away from the pass, Mercer ordered the Holy Beetles to land in a forest. He turned to the others with a serious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"There should be Royal Monkeys stationed at the pass. I'll send a spy bug to check it out," he said, opening his pocket where a bug flew out.</p>

  <p>This bug was the same size as a mosquito and was as light as dust, making it incredibly difficult to spot with the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Mercer and Miller were no good at fighting. This was the only way they could help Luo Zheng. Just as the bug was about to fly away though, Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There's no need." Mercer frowned. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>His question went unanswered as Luo Zheng turned his attention to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," he told her.</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit had gone far. They both felt it, which meant that the Royal Monkeys' destination was far away from the pass.</p>

  <p>They had to be extremely careful around these black monkeys. Yan was still in their hands after all.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they had to kill the group of black monkeys they encountered earlier, and it was only going to be a matter of time before the other monkeys found out. It was currently a race against time.</p>

  <p>'So many Royal Monkeys...' Mercer thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Then again he remembered how Feng Ge had killed those Ghost Wing Birds before, so maybe a few monkeys weren't going to be a problem.</p>

  <p>The pass was currently being guarded by patrolling Royal Monkeys.</p>

  <p>This was the only entrance to their race's territory, and thus, the security here was top notch and extremely strict. What was more, there had been a rise in the number of Royal Monkeys sent here.</p>

  <p>It was already well-guarded but the number of additional patrolmen somehow made the leader of the pass a bit uneasy.</p>

  <p>There was no way more Royal Monkeys were sent here to guard the pass for no reason. He wasn't dumb. Trouble was surely afoot for their race!</p>

  <p>Could it be the one-eyed creatures from before?</p>

  <p>A couple of years ago, these one-eyed creatures descended upon their pass but they promptly taught them a lesson. Now, they were at the top of the Dark Region of Stage Fourteen. It was impossible for those one-eyed creatures to come here now unless they were seeking death.</p>

  <p>Besides, that purified being was currently receiving the best care by the Royal Monkeys.</p>

  <p>"Chief!" a Royal Monkey on patrol shouted, interrupting the monkey chief's thoughts. "Something's coming!" The warning came as a shock to the monkey chief.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?!"</p>

  <p>He went out of his quarters, craning his neck to see what his subordinate had spotted.</p>

  <p>The sight above them stunned him. "Holy Beetles?!"</p>

  <p>These bugs were considered as the Insect Master race's rare treasures. What were they doing here?</p>

  <p>Did that mean the Insect Masters were here? Why? Were they crazy or something?</p>

  <p>The chief's eyes narrowed, a trace of anger appearing in their depths.</p>

  <p>"Insect Masters! You green-skinned men and your bugs! If you get any closer, we won't hesitate to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Insect Masters were cowards by nature, at least to the Royal Monkeys. He figured he'd be able to scare them away through verbal threats.</p>

  <p>However, the Insect Masters showed no signs of retreat and continued their approach with their Holy Beetles.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!" the chief roared though he did feel a bit apprehensive about how things were going.</p>

  <p>He winked at his two subordinates who immediately drew their javelins from their backs.</p>

  <p>Mercer and Miller thickly swallowed when they saw the Royal Monkeys bring out their weapons.</p>

  <p>Just as the Royal Monkeys took aim and were about to throw their javelins, a whistle suddenly drew their attention.</p>

  <p>The monkey chief turned to find a human man hanging on the wall. "A human?!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "What is a human doing here in the Dark Region?! He also seems to have a physical body!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's appearance caused quite a shock to the monkey chief. He felt his heart clench when he looked at him. Just a few days ago, a group of elite Royal Monkeys escorted the Souls of Light of two human women through the pass.</p>

  <p>Could it be related to this human?</p>

  <p>His apprehensions lasted only a moment though. "Kill those who break into the pass without permission!"</p>

  <p>With his command, the two subordinates raised their arms and threw their javelins towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The speed at which the javelins traveled was extremely fast but all it took was a slight twist for Luo Zheng to avoid them.</p>

  <p>Instead of his body, the javelins firmly lodged themselves deep into the wall. Luo Zheng saw it fit to use them as a makeshift chair. "Have you confirmed it?" he said to no one in particular. "Are there no other black monkeys around?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of the insult "black monkey," the Royal Monkeys immediately grew solemn. They didn't know who Luo Zheng was talking to but a voice answered, seemingly out of nowhere, "No. All black monkeys are here."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and nodded firmly. "Let's do this then!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Numerous beams of light appeared from the sky, enveloping the monkeys in the pass.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they all found themselves obliterated by the power of the Great Sanskrit Light. Once all monkeys were eliminated, the ground on which they once stood melted away and bore a circular hole within the pass.</p>

  <p>This let the light eliminate the black monkeys that were still inside.</p>

  <p>Among everyone in the pass, only the chief survived.</p>

  <p>He was a war veteran and his prestige had him in charge of guarding the Splendid Jade Pass. Now though, he watched as his entire brethren perished from the white light that suddenly fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>The only thing in his mind then was confusion. The purified being had attacked them, but why? Why? Why? Why? He tried to come up with a reason but there was none.</p>

  <p>Terrified by what he had just witnessed, the monkey chief stood up and poised to run away.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng wasn't going to let him go so easily. The only reason he was kept alive was to provide valuable information.</p>

  <p>Just as the monkey chief was about to run away, Luo Zheng pulled out the javelin he had been sitting on and flew towards his prey. The stick at the end of the javelin hit the chief, hard.</p>

  <p>"I want to know something," Luo Zheng muttered dangerously as he pinned the chief on the wall.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, you kidnapped the Soul of Light of a human girl."</p>

  <p>The monkey chief's eyes flashed knowingly. It was as he had thought. The human was here because of the two girls.</p>

  <p>"I-I just..." the monkey chief stuttered, still in a bit of a shock from the entire ordeal. Just as he spoke, dozens of thin light awls descended from above and nailed themselves on his feet, legs, shoulders, wrists, and chest.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the city wall was a human woman's figure, the source of these thin light awls.</p>

  <p>"The light of the purified being came from this woman," the chief muttered.</p>

  <p>He was completely restrained by the awls and the slightest movements could end up with him getting cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>"You want to live? Then tell me what I want to know, or else you'll end up like them," Luo Zheng threatened, nodding his head at the void.</p>

  <p>If the chief didn't comply, he'd end up being obliterated by the Great Sanskrit Light, just like the rest of his race.</p>
