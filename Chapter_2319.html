<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The True Gods quickly distanced themselves from the large group of Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>They bypassed the Divine Time Temple and continued advancing for dozens of miles before they began to slow their pace.</p>

  <p>Their vigilance was relentless, though. No one slacked in the least.</p>

  <p>Except for Zheng, Aleyna, and a few of True Gods, everyone else had entered the forbidden land a few times at least, and had a great deal of experience.</p>

  <p>The level of difficulty affiliated to exploring a forbidden land wasn't constant, but instead, changed and varied constantly.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered this forbidden land, they encountered enormous trouble, which meant nothing else than the difficulty across all the forbidden land had been increased. The deeper they travelled into the forbidden land, the more dangerous it would become. It was even possible that they'd encounter an unsolvable crisis.</p>

  <p>However, the more difficult things became, the more abundant chances would be born. The risk was always in direct proportion with the possible profit. This easily explained why nearly half the True Gods were all very willing to take such risks.</p>

  <p>As Zheng advanced, he continued combining the internal momentum within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Inside the Secret Time Room, he tried at least a dozen times.</p>

  <p>After mixing hundreds of kinds of internal momentum, he obtained a very powerful, never-before-seen energy.</p>

  <p>In spite of being its creator, he couldn't seem to control it or use it smoothly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had relied on his omnipotent ability to firmly tie the internal momentum together in his inner world. And yet, he still barely had the capacity to control the internal momentum!</p>

  <p>If he were to completely lose control over it, he knew the energy would run wild, like a horse without reins, in his inner world.</p>

  <p>If his intention was to use such formidable power to resist the enemy, he risked being seriously injured by the latter before even having the chance to make a move.</p>

  <p>He figured the problem had to be related to the mixed internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The scene in the Secret Time Room only showed him that the figure had mixed several hundred kinds of internal momentum and placed them within the sword. He was unable to figure out the names of the several hundred kinds of internal momentum, though. And other than that, it was also extremely dangerous for him to randomly combine a few hundred kinds of internal momentum. At the moment, all he could do was to keep trying within his inner world, constantly adjusting the different types of internal momentum and hoping to obtain the best possible results.</p>

  <p>"We are getting close to the Goddess Statue at the front. We can get to the second stage if we cross the Goddess Statue. Be careful. It will be much harder this time," Reginald reminded.</p>

  <p>"Huh? Goddess Statue? What's that?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You'll soon find out," Reginald replied with a cool smile. "If you want to enter the second floor of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, you have no choice but to pass by it."</p>

  <p>Everyone heard Reginald speak and they all revealed an expression of worry.</p>

  <p>In addition to Zheng, there were a few True Gods born outside the Floating Islands, too. The elites of the rich clans on the Floating Islands had prepared themselves well before attending the Astronomical Transit Day, and they knew the Time Sea Forbidden Land very well. Therefore, even Aleyna and Kelsey could provide Zheng with a detailed answer.</p>

  <p>In the past, it hadn't been easy to get by the Goddess Statue in the Time Sea Forbidden Land's first stage. From time to time, a few True Gods even died there. This time, the difficulty of passing through the Time Sea Forbidden Land had been greatly increased. Perhaps they would all be killed!</p>

  <p>"Who has a Star Door? I'm not going there without a Star Door," shouted a True God.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods also stopped walking abruptly. A True God also spoke, "If we don't have a Star Door, we'll all definitely be killed. I'm not willing to take that risk. Why don't you inform me once you've passed the Goddess Statue?"</p>

  <p>Noticing that Zheng didn't understand the thing they were talking about, Aleyna explained in a low voice, "The Star Door is a very rare treasure that was obtained from the Abyss Demon Region. It costs about eighty thousand divine might coins."</p>

  <p>"What? That's so expensive!" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly." Aleyna nodded. "But the Star Door is still very important. It often works really well, especially in the forbidden land. You'll understand soon enough."</p>

  <p>After Aleyna had explained the situation, all of the True Gods present had fallen silent.</p>

  <p>The Star Door was so expensive that the people who owned one often didn't want to put it into use so easily. They all wanted others to offer their Star Doors instead.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Reginald shook his head. "Well, I'm very lucky to have survived the danger this time. I will use the Star Door this time!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a black scroll appeared in his hand. The scroll itself was densely packed with golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Reginald shook the black scroll in his hand slightly, and the golden Sanskrit words on the scroll began to flicker in the light. At the same time, a faint blue light ring appeared in front of him. The light ring began to spin, spreading out layers of blue light along with it. In the middle, contrastingly, it emitted a dark blue light which looked almost like a piece of high gem floating in midair.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Star Door? What a beautiful sight!" Zheng exclaimed. At the same time, he also noticed that a strong internal momentum was being emitted from the Star Door. The internal momentum belonged to the Space Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat when he felt the Star Door's intense internal momentum. It was absolutely astonishing!</p>

  <p>Although he didn't fully understand the internal momentum, he could comprehend, after activating the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>That said, for the time being, Zheng had no idea exactly what the Star Door was even for. More importantly, once he used the theurgy, he would probably expose his true identity. After all, he had fought with many True Gods present by taking advantage of the Infinity Ruler's ability.</p>

  <p>'I'll have to do it later, ' Zheng muttered as he managed to restrain his impulse.</p>

  <p>After activating a Star Door from the scroll in his hand, Reginald asked,</p>

  <p>"I've already contributed one Star Door. Who is willing to offer another one?"</p>

  <p>A moment's silence followed before Pascal said, "I can provide one, too."</p>

  <p>Pascal was the most talented mid-rank True God in the Han Clan's younger generation, and the Han Clan had given him plenty ravishing treasures. He equally took out a scroll that was exactly the same as Reginald's. "I'll unfold the Star Door when I arrive at the Goddess Statue."</p>

  <p>Reginald nodded and then asked, "Now that we have enough Star Doors, are you all willing to go together?"</p>

  <p>When the other True Gods saw the Star Door, they were slightly relieved and followed Reginald as he began to move forward.</p>

  <p>Part of the group, Zheng still felt puzzled. "Aleyna, you haven't told me the use of the Star Door yet."</p>

  <p>Aleyna smiled slightly and responded, "It's like a transmission channel, but it's a special one. When people enter the Star Door, they will be transported to the next nearest Star Door."</p>

  <p>"Are you saying that a temporary transmission array can be built in this type of situation?" Zheng asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the Star Door has a special characteristic that allows to transfer people to the nearest Star Door, and thus, the process requires two Star Doors. My brother will also use another Star Door later, so that a temporary transmission channel will be formed between the two,"</p>

  <p>Aleyna explained.</p>

  <p>After hearing Aleyna's explanation, Zheng was still uncertain. He wondered why they needed the Star Doors when passing through the Goddess Statue. Despite his confusion, he didn't ask any more questions.</p>

  <p>He silently moved forward along with the group.</p>

  <p>As he crossed a small mountain pass, he noticed a huge canyon and at its center, he discovered a statue that was more than a hundred feet high.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng saw the statue clearly, he was shocked and his body began to tremble.</p>

  <p>"Could this be the Goddess Statue?" he asked in a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. What's wrong?" Aleyna asked. A strange look came over her face as she noticed Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>Kelsey, who was silent, also looked at Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The Goddess Statue was carved from a huge gem, and was completely transparent. The carved goddess was seated on a huge tree stump, looking up at the sky. Her expression, her clothes, and even her detailed strands of hair were incomparably exquisite.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt as though he had seen this face before. It looked almost the same as Yan's, but with a totally different temperament and aura.</p>

  <p>After killing the mud creature beneath the Tie Clan's ground, Zheng had obtained a peculiar bead from it. He had seen this face before, but at the time, he could only see a young girl's head soaked in a big pot. Now, what he saw was her whole body.</p>

  <p>This Goddess Statue was the same one as he had seen back then. Now, Zheng was sure of that!</p>
