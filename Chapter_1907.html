<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed as soon as Holy Jay finished speaking.</p>

  <p>"What do you know?" Luo Luo Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Talking to a Holy Being in this tone was very rude, but Holy Jay had expected this reaction from Luo Luo Zheng and was unbothered by it.</p>

  <p>"As you now know, Mike is your father," Holy Jay said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had come up with this conclusion after his conversation with the Han sisters in the Skyland race tower.</p>

  <p>It seemed Holy Jay had been paying attention to him ever since he entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, or else he wouldn't have known about the forming suspicion on Luo Zheng's mind about Mike being his father.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only speculated before as he had no way of confirming Mike's identity. After all, it could very well just be a coincidence. Anyone could have the same name as his father...</p>

  <p>But now that he heard it from Holy Jay himself, the situation looked completely different.</p>

  <p>He didn't think Holy Jay was bored enough that he would kid him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if what Holy Jay said was anything to go by, Holy Jay seemed to have a close relationship with Luo Zheng's father and was helping him!</p>

  <p>And as he thought further, his rather lucky encounters in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were all starting to make sense. Holy Jay had set up the land to release all of his energy, which Luo Luo Zheng thought, had been a very generous gesture.</p>

  <p>However, no Holy Being would willingly give a third of their strength source. Doing so was just being an idiot.</p>

  <p>And what was odder was that Luo Luo Zheng never encountered any obstacles even when he had absorbed so much strength source.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay stepped closer to Luo Luo Zheng, the darkness doing nothing to stop him from eyeing the boy. His gaze was so intense it was as if he could see through Luo Zheng's soul. And it did. Holy Jay could see everything, from the nine Genuine Dragons, the huge furnace, down into Luo Zheng's elixir field.</p>

  <p>However, he reached a block as he came just outside of Luo Zheng's inner world, preventing him from peering in.</p>

  <p>In an ordinary martial artist, the elixir field was connected to the inner world. As the saying went, one flower was a world. An elixir field could contain a world. The inner world truly did exist within the elixir field.</p>

  <p>But with Luo Luo Zheng, it was completely different. His inner world existed in the chaos, a place outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the only one that could communicate with his inner world, and the only way to do so was by the Cross-world Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay also possessed the Cross-world Theurgy, but he could only use it with the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>It would have no effect on worlds he didn't build, which was why he couldn't see through Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>In the entire divine land, it was only the Holy Beings' inner worlds that Holy Jay couldn't see through as it was impossible for Holy Beings to pry into each other's universes.</p>

  <p>"What a wondrous inner world! A world created in chaos. It can be called the new divine land," Holy Jay said in wonder.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already made an initial judgment of his own inner world, so he wasn't surprised by Holy Jay's words. It seemed that Holy Jay really knew about him, and the knowledge he had exceeded what Luo Luo Zheng had imagined.</p>

  <p>"What is your relationship with my father?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. He was anxious to know more about Mike.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay waved his hand. "There are some things that take too long to explain. How do I say this...?"</p>

  <p>At this exact moment, several flashes of golden light appeared, causing Holy Jay to look back. "Oh yes, do you know why I destroyed the nine stars and built such a strong Dark Law?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I was observing something," said Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>"Sanskrit words," Luo Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. "Right and wrong. To be precise, I was, and still am, observing some creatures. These creatures are beyond imagination, and these complex characters? the Sanskrit words? belong to them. Only in absolute darkness will I be able to find clues left behind by these creatures; and in order to create this perfect Dark Law, I have spent a lot of time and effort."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still confused.</p>

  <p>The Dark Law within this black sphere was extremely dense. Nothing was visible in it, which made Luo Luo Zheng wonder just what kind of creature was inside.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Holy Jay was the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. If these creatures existed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, how could he not know about them?</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's confusion, Holy Jay continued explaining. "These creatures are not common creatures. Think of it like this: if creatures born in inner worlds are called secondary creatures, then warriors in the divine land would be the ordinary creatures. The creatures I am looking for are extraordinary creatures."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary creatures?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated, still confused.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. "The way they exist is unimaginable to us."</p>

  <p>"Were they the ones who built the divine land?" Luo Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>It was simple. The Holy Beings of the divine land had created the universes, which meant the living beings in these universes would be considered secondary creatures. Strictly speaking, Luo Luo Zheng himself was a secondary creature. Therefore, the creatures in a secondary creature's inner world would be called tertiary creatures.</p>

  <p>Now that he thought about it, since extraordinary creatures were of a level above all martial artists in the divine land, they had to be a life form from outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"There is some sense in your deduction," Holy Jay replied. "But whether these creatures built the divine land is still unknown. However, because their level of existence is higher than ours, the things they display aren't something we can simply understand. Just like the Sanskrit you saw."</p>

  <p>As he finished his sentence, golden light shone in the darkness and another Sanskrit word appeared.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay motioned to the word. "For example, this character contains a lot of information, but you can only see the appearance of a Sanskrit word; you cannot decipher the information inside."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. Although he really wanted to know more about his father, he was also attracted by what Holy Jay said.</p>

  <p>Indeed...</p>

  <p>The structure of the characters looked complex, but it was not difficult to create and imitate them. However, when Luo Luo Zheng looked at the characters, he got a strange feeling, like there was something about them he couldn't see.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the race that created these Sanskrit characters is able to decipher them," Holy Jay continued excitedly, "since the way the world appears in their eyes is completely different from ours! I have an analogy for this. When we see a flower, we only see a flower. When we see a grain of sand, we only see a grain of sand, but! These extraordinary creatures can see every detail in that flower? the meridians in the center, every pollen, every nook and cranny..."</p>

  <p>"And this is amazing?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. Holy Jay's theory still confused him.</p>

  <p>Plus, it wasn't really difficult for some warriors to see through the structure of some things, was it?</p>

  <p>"Very much so." Holy Jay answered enthusiastically. "They are higher beings whose existences are far beyond our understanding. Back then, your father, Holy Bromley who taught you the Primal Chaos Technique, and I found traces of these creatures and started a new quest..."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had completely lost his strong warrior demeanor as he talked about these things.</p>

  <p>"Holy Bromley?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>His master's name was Bromley. He was called Holy Bromley in the universe and his father was Holy Mike...</p>

  <p>Holy Jay was a new Holy Being, which meant Holy Mike and Holy Bromley were both his seniors. The three of them had a very good relationship with each other.</p>

  <p>When they had discovered the traces of extraordinary creatures, they continued to explore, and Luo Zheng's Grand Weapon Refining Method, Xenia's page of Sanskrit words, and Holy Jay's Ice Soul Flame had all been developed during the exploration.</p>
