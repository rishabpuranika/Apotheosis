<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1002 Being Jealous </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a woman, Ning Yudie was very sensitive about that sort of matter. It was a rather sore subject for her.</p>

  <p>Looking at Mu Ning straight in the eyes gave her a glimpse of the truth.</p>

  <p>Due to her engrossment in the Cloud Hall, she had not been able to make the time to talk to Luo Luo Zheng comprehensibly. What had happened in the past two years? Why did he come back? What happened in Mist's celestial tomb?</p>

  <p>After she was done with work, she planned to have a talk with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young lady of the Xi Clan suddenly came to the Cloud Hall that time to look for Luo Luo Zheng. Baffled, she wondered if something had happened between the two.</p>

  <p>Some time ago, Ning Yudie had heard about Mu Ning, the young lady of the Xi Clan, and even suggested that the Ethereal Spirit Sect get her married as soon as possible. The young lady had the Purple Power Body. So, if she was to be caught by Eddie, the consequences were grave. Even Yan could get in trouble under such circumstances.</p>

  <p>How did she get acquainted with Luo Luo Zheng? Did she follow him to the Cloud Hall?</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yudie's words, Mu Ning couldn't help but feel a little humiliated. Although she had a terrible temperament and was headstrong, she was a lady from a noble clan after all. Those kinds of things were embarrassing to be discussed in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>The expression on Xi Youqin's face added confusion to Ning Yudie, who was already mentally guessing the kind of relationship the two had. In a low voice, Ning Yudie spoke, "Remove the enchanted barrier and let her in!"</p>

  <p>Under Yudie's command, the enchanted barrier in the Cloud Hall was instantly removed. After Mu Ning got inside, the enchanted barrier covered the Cloud Hall again.</p>

  <p>The young lady flew straight towards Luo Luo Zheng when she saw him.</p>

  <p>Stunned at that certain moment, Luo Luo Zheng had no clue how to react.</p>

  <p>When they were in the underground palace, Luo Luo Zheng had acted on his rage instead of being careful. Also, Eddie and Simon were nearby and very eager to find them. Luo Luo Zheng was afraid Eddie might take Mu Ning away. If that happened, all hell could break loose. Ultimately, he chose to take away that woman's virginity energy instead.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's intentions were reasonable, he was undeniably being unfair to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Besides, it was inevitable for Mu Ning to be considered as the first woman in Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p id="top_17">Ignoring the glances she was getting from the others, Mu Ning floated over and leaned against Luo Luo Zheng with her head lowered, almost like a child who had done something wrong.</p>

  <p>When she witnessed such affection right before her, Yudie's face hardened. Anger filled her heart.</p>

  <p>However, as the leader of the Cloud Hall, she did not dare express her jealousy. Ning Yudie handled her emotions quite well. Forcefully, she suppressed her displeasure and allowed a faint smile to appear on her face. Through gritted teeth, she asked, "Miss Xi, may I know why you followed Luo Luo Zheng to the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>The other elders, including Morphens, exchanged glances. Based on the sudden change in Yudie's expression, they all understood what she really felt at that particular time.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng was a member, it was only appropriate for him to bring Mu Ning into the Cloud Hall. In addition, Ning Yudie had already confirmed that Mu Ning was indeed the young lady of the Xi Clan who possessed the Purple Power Body. No wonder why she could summon numerous giant swords.</p>

  <p>That time, the Heavenly Evil Sect was wreaking havoc in the north. It was their duty to let Mu Ning temporarily stay in the Cloud Hall and protect her. In that case, it was a question why Ning Yudie had to ask her purpose of coming there.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, she was indeed very jealous of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Anger became a little more obvious on Yudie's face. She was like a volcano, ready to erupt at any given minute. The Cloud Hall elders decided it was better if they just left. So, silently, they all retreated back to their safe place.</p>

  <p>"I've already had nowhere else to go," Mu Ning replied.</p>

  <p>A war was happening between the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the Heavenly Evil Sect. And the Heavenly Evil Sect had managed to destroy the transmission arrays. Thus, Mu Ning wasn't able to receive any kind of update yet. It was obviously dangerous for her to return to the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>"Why did you follow Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie asked again, staring at Mu Ning intently.</p>

  <p>The way she was staring alarmed Mu Ning a great deal. Ning Yudie had also asked the same question again and again. Not answering her, Mu Ning asked, "You're the leader of the Cloud Hall, right?"</p>

  <p>"I am," Ning Yudie replied.</p>

  <p>Pursing her lips, Mu Ning uttered, "I am willing to follow and stay with Luo Luo Zheng wherever he is. As the leader of the Cloud Hall, why must you ask about such personal matters?"</p>

  <p>After being questioned back by Mu Ning, Ning Yudie was left speechless.</p>

  <p>True enough, Ning Yudie wasn't to meddle with such matters despite the fact that she was the leader of the Cloud Hall which Luo Luo Zheng belonged to. Even if she had the greatest ability to control the Mysterious Luna Hall, she didn't have the right to interfere with whatever was really going on. It was between Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning. She was in no place to pry.</p>

  <p>A look of isolation appeared on Yudie's face. Glancing over to Luo Luo Zheng, she sighed, "You're right. I should not ask about those things. Luo Luo Zheng, she has the Purple Power Body, so it should be made sure that she isn't taken away by Eddie. Let her stay here for the time being."</p>

  <p>After saying that, Ning Yudie turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt extremely uncomfortable and gloomy about Mu Ning and Yudie's interaction. It seemed that Ning Yudie didn't have a clue what happened nor did she know he took Xi Youqin's virginity energy away.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, rays of red light leaked out and Xun emerged from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Feeling a little unhappy the past few days, the current exchange between the women perked her up. Staring at Ning Yudie as she left, Xun said softly, "She hasn't even found out, but her reaction was already major.</p>

  <p>How much more if she knows the actual truth?"</p>

  <p>Of course, Mu Ning knew what Xun meant by the "actual truth".</p>

  <p>Her face flushed.</p>

  <p>A bitter look appeared on Luo Zheng's face. To him, dealing with that kind of matter was just as difficult as fighting against Eddie. It amused Xun how Ning Yudie managed her feelings during her contact with Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Back when Mu Ning was left alone in the Fire City, Luo Luo Zheng did not think much about it. He knew that he was in trouble because of her. At that time, Luo Luo Zheng tried to shake off Eddie's pursuit in hopes to get rid of trouble.</p>

  <p>Now that Mu Ning had come to the Cloud Hall to look for Luo Luo Zheng, how was he going to deal with things?</p>

  <p>"I'll arrange a place for you to stay first. Follow me," he said, pulling a long face. He then went with Mu Ning to find a steward of the Cloud Hall to assist them.</p>

  <p>There were many female disciples in the Cloud Hall. Those who had been promoted to the Cloud Hall from the Iridescence Sect were mostly women. Thus, it wasn't difficult to arrange a place for Mu Ning to stay.</p>

  <p>However, they had no idea how to cater to her as time went by.</p>

  <p>What kind of relationship could she have had with Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng was uncertain of that. Perhaps, he had already methodically planned his own path for martial arts, but in relationships, Luo Luo Zheng was in shambles.</p>

  <p>Unlike Luo Luo Zheng, Mu Ning had a clearer outlook on things.</p>

  <p>The place that Luo Luo Zheng had arranged for Mu Ning was quite decent. At least, it was much better compared to the living places of the other female disciples. However, Mu Ning still couldn't get used to it.</p>

  <p>Ever since she was young, the environment of the place she had lived in for most of her life was always carefully selected, from the size, height and even the materials used for her bronze mirror that hung on the wall, up to the positioning of the bed and the materials of her pillows.</p>

  <p>Considering her current circumstance, she was being favored. However, it was still impossible for her to get some sleep.</p>

  <p>Sitting upright on the bed, Mu Ning wrapped her arms around her knees, staring blankly at the dark sky outside the window. A smile suddenly appeared on her face. Even if she wasn't used to this sort of life, she was determined to endure for the sake of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This picky and stubborn young lady seemed to have found a great, noble reason for completing a difficult task.</p>

  <p>If anyone else were to know that the somewhat simple and crude environment of the Cloud Hall actually caused Mu Ning to feel very morose and disappointed, they would be surprised.</p>

  <p>On that very night, she was not the only one awake.</p>

  <p>In the Ice Palace, Ning Yudie continued reinforcing her cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Having just entered the Life and Death Realm, she needed some time to tend to her life vitality. Being in the Life and Death Realm could liquefy one's life vitality. Only after she reached the Soul Sea Realm was she able to have a space to transform her life vitality into the Soul Sea. By then, she could create a world inside her.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie was cultivating in peace, she felt extremely agitated.</p>

  <p>From time to time, the words that Mu Ning uttered flashed through her mind.</p>

  <p>She wondered if she had the right to ask Luo Luo Zheng about Mu Ning.</p>
