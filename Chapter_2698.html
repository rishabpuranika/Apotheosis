</p>

  <p>"Leyton, right now, the divine land has almost hit the bottom. It's extremely desolate even compared with the chaos," Zavier said with a giggle. "It's completely meaningless to use the Yellow Emperor Magatama."</p>

  <p>Leyton didn't take his words and didn't listen but instead, he said to Hamish, "Do as I say. Don't miss any chance."</p>

  <p>Hamish was considered to be the weakest among the five Yellow Emperor Guards. The rest had more or less alienated him, but Leyton had always taken good care of him.</p>

  <p>Now that Leyton tasked him something important, he nodded and said, "I will do as you ordered."</p>

  <p>When he was on his trip to the Lofty Tree in the north, some people on the Time Sea had already begun to move.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods of the alliance of powerful clans had been exploring the Abyss Demon Region during the past ten years, so they had a further understanding and knowledge about it.</p>

  <p>However, their actions were at the expense of the lives of their peers.</p>

  <p>There were countless talented elites in the powerful clans, but it was a fat price to pay. They would be torn apart by the monsters lurking around the Abyss Demon Region if they weren't careful enough.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods of humble birth grumbled and were discontented with this current situation.</p>

  <p>In the past, the members of the alliance of powerful clans could freely go to the Everest Spirit Mountain and the Swirl Forest. These two forbidden lands were extremely dangerous, but they could get countless divine might coins while ensuring their safety in the places that they were familiar with.</p>

  <p>But more than ten years ago, Harold appeared. He suddenly came forward and forbade them to go to the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>The worst thing that happened was, just few years ago, the Swirl Forest was sealed.</p>

  <p>The purpose for sealing the Swirl Forest remained a mystery to them.</p>

  <p>They didn't even know who had ruled it.</p>

  <p>As a result, they could only go to the Abyss Demon Region, and the risks there were known to increase exponentially.</p>

  <p>Despite the risks, as long as they were careful enough and didn't enter the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region, they would still get a lot of treasures. After all, the Abyss Demon Region was the biggest forbidden land.</p>

  <p>But now, it was said that even the Abyss Demon Region had also been sealed.</p>

  <p>"Have all the transmission channels leading to the Abyss Demon Region been closed?"</p>

  <p>"Why is the Abyss Demon Region also sealed? Could it be that someone has taken control of it?"</p>

  <p>"Come on! It's simply impossible for anyone to control the Abyss Demon Region. You know, those fiends at the bottom can even devour the Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>A heated discussion arose as numerous True Gods gathered in front of the transmission arrays of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Each one of them had spoken their own thoughts about it.</p>

  <p>Even the guards who were guarding the transmission arrays thought that it was unreasonable.</p>

  <p>But this was the order of the Holy Beings. They didn't have the capability to disobey such an order.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the Goldenrain Hall, all the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans had gathered.</p>

  <p>There were also many consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had an unprecedented sense of crisis. It started the moment he saw the powerful masters outside the divine land in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>There were two reasons for him to reach his current position. One was because of his talents and efforts, and the other was that he had the support of Hamish. The only thing he could do now was to try his best to take control of the Abyss Demon Region, remove the Mixed Element Seals of the remaining Yellow Emperor Guards, and then use some methods like the Ruling Slate. Perhaps, he still had a chance in this way.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, you should have known why I summoned you here,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas spoke, as the crowd's attention was turned to him. "There are four forbidden lands, but three of them are not under our control. We can't let the last one fall into the hands of Harold and his fellows! I hope that one of you can become the ruler of the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas finished his last words, the eyes of many consummate True Gods present suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>Starting from the time when one became a top-rank True God, it was as difficult as crossing a natural chasm to reach a higher level in cultivation.</p>

  <p>The chance of becoming a Demi-holy Being or even a Holy Being could only be found by accident. It was deemed to be almost impossible.</p>

  <p>If they were able to obtain the opportunity to control the Abyss Demon Region, they would probably improve their cultivation greatly and become comparable to Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>For this opportunity, who would miss it?</p>

  <p>Nicholas, at the end of his words, had his eyes fallen on Lowell and Troy.</p>

  <p>In the past, the best person in Nicholas's heart was Troy. However, Lowell's performance in recent years really shocked him. His opinion about the position eventually got swayed precariously between the two.</p>

  <p>"You have already been to the Abyss Demon Region before. I think you should be very clear about how dangerous it is. We will set out in half a month. You can make preparations during this period of time," Nicholas reminded and gave further instructions.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a faint voice suddenly resounded from outside of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Holy Nicholas, since you have something important to discuss, why don't you invite me? Haha..." Samuel didn't dare to set foot on the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan. He could only float outside and send his voice in.</p>

  <p>Murphy, Jeremiah and the rest of the Holy Beings knitted their brows upon hearing his voice.</p>

  <p>With a sneer, Clark said, "This guy wants to take a share again. He should know he's not welcome since we didn't invite him. But he still comes here in person!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas, on the other hand, had no reason to shut the door on Samuel.</p>

  <p>After all, Samuel was a Holy Being. He still spoke in a polite manner,</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, Samuel. Suddenly the incident happened, and I forgot to invite you. Please come inside."</p>

  <p>Right after, the space fluctuated and Samuel had come out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>Behind him, there were consummate True Gods of the Han Clan, including Alfredo.</p>

  <p>"What a surprise, Samuel. It has only been about ten years, yet your daughters and son have stepped into the consummation of True God Realm!" Jeremiah's gaze focused on the two girls behind Alfredo with amazement. There was an unbelievable expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, and even the other Holy Beings, showed a little astonishment on their faces.</p>

  <p>The two daughters were Liusu and Aleyna, and the son was Pascal.</p>

  <p>The three of them had followed Alfredo with a stiff, indifferent and blank expression showing on their faces.</p>

  <p>Ten years ago, Pascal, Liusu and Aleyna had been ranked first or second among their peers in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Of all the disciples of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, they were considered the most gifted people.</p>

  <p>Reaching the consummation of True God Realm was undeniably not an easy thing to achieve.</p>

  <p>Only a few had made it. Zheng was one who had been successful in a span of ten years, which quite surprised other consummate True Gods. And now, there came three consummate True Gods of the Han Clan!</p>

  <p>When was it so easy to cultivate consummate True Gods?</p>

  <p>Samuel cupped one hand in the other and said respectfully, "I'm glad that my daughters and son have made great achievements in martial arts.</p>

  <p>Now that you are going to conquer the Abyss Demon Region, I'd like to ask for an opportunity. Would you give me this opportunity, Holy Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>Before Nicholas could utter a response, Jeremiah shook his head and said, "I'm afraid we can't trust you."</p>

  <p>Samuel had planned to unite with the Leng Clan by marriage. He wanted to join the alliance of powerful clans through this way.</p>

  <p>But because of Zheng's appearance, Langston of the Leng Clan had a big conflict with Liusu. The result was that their marriage was cancelled.</p>

  <p>This time, Langston had just become a top-rank True God, while the two daughters of the Han Clan had reached the consummation of True God Realm. This turn of events had quite upset him.</p>
