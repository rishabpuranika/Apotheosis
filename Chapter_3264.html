<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Dorothy's Soul of Light grew to the Indigo Soul, her attack's intensity increased as well.</p>

  <p>Her irresistible soul force was so mighty that the thin blade in Haider's hand was sent flying. Even Haider was forced to take a few steps backward.</p>

  <p>If ordinary people were saved at a crucial life and death moment, their first thought would be to escape.</p>

  <p>However, Chaim was by no means an ordinary man.</p>

  <p>When he saw Haider staggering backward, he didn't stop to see who had saved him. Instead, he believed this to be the perfect opportunity to attack Haider. And so, he slammed his feet against the ground and somersaulted through the air.</p>

  <p>When he felt considerable pressure descending on him, Haider panicked and glanced up.</p>

  <p>Unable to protect himself, Haider fell to the ground after Chaim trampled his head.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw!"</p>

  <p>Chaim ordered.</p>

  <p>The eight soul swords flew toward Chaim. Just as they were about to pierce through Haider's body, Haider returned to his senses. Upon detecting the threat, he released a strong soul force, and a bear shadow flashed faintly on his back.</p>

  <p>At this moment, his soul force increased manifold. As a result, Chaim could not hold on and was flung into the air.</p>

  <p>'What a pity, '</p>

  <p>Chaim sighed in his heart.</p>

  <p>His ultimate goal was to kill Haider with his soul swords.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace wasn't a match for so many super forces, and yet, he had nearly reached his goal just now. The disappointment he felt was palpable.</p>

  <p>After the bear shadow appeared behind Haider, he resembled an angry lion.</p>

  <p>"Members of the Divine Farmer race and the Jin Wu, what are you waiting for? Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Now that the other two races were attacking Chaim, Haider turned his attention to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Whoever dares to stand in my way is doomed to die!"</p>

  <p>Haider moved so quickly and his aura was so overwhelming that it was a thrill to watch him.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Bear Soul Shadow of the Bearing race?"</p>

  <p>"It's so powerful! But it is said that he has to pay a heavy price for it."</p>

  <p>"The human woman who attacked Haider is not weak."</p>

  <p>Panic flashed across Dorothy's face when she saw that Haider was heading straight for her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy lacked experience in soul battles and didn't know how to escape this dilemma.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As her Necklace of Mystic Soul flashed, a soul sword shot toward Haider again.</p>

  <p>Haider didn't flinch when he saw the soul sword nearing him. On the contrary, he stretched out his hand and slapped it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>His attack deflected the soul sword.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy was dumbstruck with fear when her attack failed. She knew that she had to flee, or she would die!</p>

  <p>Her Soul of Light flashed, and she rushed to the other side.</p>

  <p>But as she was not as fast as Haider, the distance between them decreased continually.</p>

  <p>"Leave the Other Shore now!" shouted Chaim from a distance.</p>

  <p>He was dealing with the attacks of the Divine Farmer race and the Jin Wu. Although overwhelmed, he noticed Dorothy's predicament from the corner of his eye. When he saw that Dorothy was stupidly trying to escape, he reminded her.</p>

  <p>As she found herself in a situation where she couldn't escape, Dorothy prepared to use the Illusion Breaking Rune to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, she saw a familiar figure appear in front of her.</p>

  <p>Then she stopped reciting the spell.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you thinking?"</p>

  <p>Helplessness coursed through Chaim when he saw that Dorothy still hadn't left. He hadn't, as yet, noticed who had appeared in front of Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Haider was only fifty or sixty feet away from Dorothy. As he was afraid that she would leave the Other Shore, he gathered all his strength to activate his soul force. As a result, a faint golden light flashed on the bear shadow behind him.</p>

  <p>As Haider leaped forward, his hands turned into sharp claws. Just as he was about to grab Dorothy, she pounced forward. The man in front of her reached out and caught her. The two of them spun wildly for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then, the man skillfully removed the impact force from Dorothy, and threw a palm at Haider.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Haider didn't have time to figure out the identity of the man. He only knew that he had used the Bear Soul Shadow. As a result, his Soul of Light would be burned off, piece by piece. As soul pills could not replenish a burned Soul of Light, he had to use soul crystal instead.</p>

  <p>Now, he was burning his soul crystal and his cultivation base!</p>

  <p>The price was high, but the effect was visible. No one could stop him in the thirteen stages of the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Haider reached forward and tried to defend against the palm. He believed that with his strike, he could break his opponent's arm. Moreover, he was so angry that he wanted to tear his opponent apart.</p>

  <p>But all that was wishful thinking. As soon as his hands touched the man's palm, Haider felt as though something was wrong.</p>

  <p>It seemed that his opponent was not a soul and that his arm was made of fine steel.</p>

  <p>He couldn't even move the arm, let alone break it.</p>

  <p id="top_27">"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Confusion coursed through Haider as he reeled from his failed attack. Luo Zheng, on the other hand, sneered, "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>With that, he attacked Haider's chest.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't even use all his strength.</p>

  <p>However, the power contained within his palm strike was far more than a hundred times stronger than Haider's.</p>

  <p>Although the bear shadow behind Haider tried to protect him, it only lasted for a very short time. Soon, the shock wave shattered the shadow, and Haider, like a piece of light paper, flew backward.</p>

  <p>As the shadow dissipated, his Soul of Light also collapsed, and gradually, it dissipated on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>With just one palm strike, Luo Zheng had destroyed Haider's Soul of Light, even though the Bear Soul Shadow protected him!</p>

  <p>When the other races witnessed that, they were shocked.</p>

  <p>"He has a corporeal body!"</p>

  <p>"Why is a corporeal body here?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard? It's said that he created trouble in the Separate Abyss race, and almost destroyed their temple!"</p>

  <p>While some people from the other races knew about Luo Zheng's earlier actions, the majority of them did not. They couldn't believe what they had seen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng relaxed his arms and placed Dorothy on the ground. After a brief pause, Dorothy glared at him and said, "You were late."</p>

  <p>"Why did you get involved in a fight?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Before he continued his journey with his physical body, he had asked Dorothy to leave the Other Shore to ensure her safety.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't expect that as soon as he arrived, he would see that Haider was chasing Dorothy. So his tone was reproachful.</p>

  <p>Dorothy pouted and said, "I don't know. As soon as I returned to the Other Shore, I saw that the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were fighting with the Bearing race. Chaim was almost killed before I went to help them."</p>

  <p>When she entered the Other Shore, she saw Chaim risking his life. As for why the disciples fought with the Bearing race, she did not know.</p>

  <p>Chaim was being attacked by the Jin Wu and the Divine Farmer race. Although he was flexible and had several schemes, the combined strength of the two races was beyond what he could handle.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Zheng's appearance, the other races stopped their attacks.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu and the Divine Farmer race didn't want to get involved in this battle in the first place. It was only on Haider's insistence that they obliged.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu might not have seen Luo Zheng's body before, but the Divine Farmer race had witnessed how Luo Zheng had destroyed the temple of the Bearing race. Even if some of them hadn't seen Luo Zheng, they had already heard about him.</p>

  <p>They knew that they could not fight against such a monster.</p>
