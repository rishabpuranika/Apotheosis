<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2156 Battle Between Two Warriors (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thomson and Woolley were from the Misty Mountain Village, which was considered a remote mountain village, thus making it reasonable for them not to have practiced high quality martial skills.</p>

  <p>However, in Zheng's opinion, the warriors of the Sun Moon Village were also extremely weak. They might all have the cultivation of the Spirit Supreme Realm, but that was all they had. In terms of martial skills, they weren't even close to the level of those of the Soul Sea Realm in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had arrived in the Six-Burden Divine City, the people he had to face were easily considered the elites of the third-class clans.</p>

  <p>However, Steve's move still left Zheng feeling disappointed.</p>

  <p>Although the Coiling Dragon Spear was exquisite, Zheng thought it was much too gaudy. He knew he could easily break through the spear with his great speed. How could the spear be considered so 'excellent'? Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know though, was that in the universe, martial skills actually progressed much further and even much faster than those in the divine land. This was because the divine citizens of the divine land would have the capacity of surpassing the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm in a shorter period of time, thus becoming proving godly warriors at an early age.</p>

  <p>And after becoming a proving godly warrior, one would immediately step into the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The cultivation period of those below the True God level was very short.</p>

  <p>It was therefore only normal that no one was willing to put much time and effort into studying these martial techniques. After all, once they became True Gods, they were bound to have higher-level cultivation methods to study.</p>

  <p>Steve's spear pierced the air and sped toward Holt. Holt, on his behalf, was already prepared for the attack. He suddenly flipped his body into the air and dodged Steve's spear strike with an ingenious movement technique. At the same time, Holt rolled forward in an attempt to get closer to Steve.</p>

  <p>The longer a weapon was, the stronger it was considered. That said though, the longer a weapon was, the more fearful it was of being too close to the target. The closer the target was in proximity, the harder it was for the weapon to unleash its full power.</p>

  <p>There was no way Steve would allow this to happen.</p>

  <p>He held the snake shaped golden spear in his hand tightly and shook it lightly. The head of the snake came to life at once and coiled around the golden spear, all while continuously thrusting toward Holt.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The three consecutive thrusts all hit the ground.</p>

  <p>The materials in the divine land were far more solid than those found in the universes. If they had been in a universe, then Steve's three thrusts would have been capable of destroying three massive mountains in their entirety. However, here in the divine land, the thrusts only created three small holes in the floor.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched, he equally noticed that the floor actually had a healing function. As soon as the small holes appeared, they began to squirm inward on themselves and disappear.</p>

  <p>Other people were used to seeing such details, but this was a first for Zheng, and he still felt all this was very interesting. Over in the Evolutionary Universe, there was no 'floor' that could withstand the attacks of world lords. In fact, even if such a material existed there, no one would dare waste it like this and transform it into a floor.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Holt had already gotten quite close to Steve, none of the three thrusts given just moments ago had actually hit Holt. In Holt's hands, a blue light flashed. An icy blue sharp sword appeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>And with a twist of Holt's short sword, a blue ray of light unexpectedly shot outward. The sound of tearing cloth could be heard as the short sword came to a sudden halt right in front of Steve's neck.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow. "Now that wasn't a bad move!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Steve was short of breath and heaving as he stared at Holt.</p>

  <p>If the icy blue short sword had continued moving upward only slightly, there was no doubt that Steve would have died right here, right now.</p>

  <p>Today would have been the last day of his life.</p>

  <p>"You give in?" Holt asked in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>Steve glared hatefully at him, his eyes shinning. In front of so many people, he had no desire of staying here any longer. He cupped his hands together, extending them toward the crowd and retreated out of the patio.</p>

  <p>Holt bowed in victory and smiled at the crowd as he prepared to leave himself.</p>

  <p>But before Holt could set foot outside the patio, a divine might coin was tossed down from upstairs. It bounced a few times on the ground, spun on itself and landed with a barely audible thud. From somewhere in the crowd, a faint voice sounded out, "Holt, how about I challenge you?"</p>

  <p>As the voice faded further away, the divine might coin on the ground suddenly jumped again, as if controlled by magic, and hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>When the voice issued its challenge, the power of the Thousand Commandments Slate appeared anew, allowing the divine might coin to float in the air.</p>

  <p>"I have something more important to do, so I think I'll skip my turn this time around."</p>

  <p>In all honesty though, Holt's only desire was to challenge Steve. He didn't want to accept any challenge from anyone else. Once he finished speaking, he turned around and left the patio at once.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the floating divine might coin indifferently.</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no intentions of fighting. Even if he won, he would still lose a divine might coin just for a battle. Such a terrible deal meant absolutely nothing to him.</p>

  <p>However, what Zheng saw next made his eyes widen and brighten with excitement.</p>

  <p>Divine might coins were suddenly raining down from the fourth floor!</p>
