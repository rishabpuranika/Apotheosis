</p>

  <p>This scolding battle was even way more outrageous than the one Luo Luo Zheng had participated in last time.</p>

  <p>To put it into perspective, this one had been going on for at least fourteen to sixteen hours now.</p>

  <p>Xun paused, noticing the stunned expression on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, nothing's wrong! Just curse as much as you want," Luo Luo Zheng assured her.</p>

  <p>Xun's face reddened in embarrassment, realizing just how much she had cursed in front of Luo Luo Zheng. She didn't know why, but she didn't feel good about the possibility that Luo Luo Zheng might see her as a shrew...</p>

  <p>So she shook her head and stopped the scolding.</p>

  <p>Contrary to what she thought though, Luo Luo Zheng completely understood her need to vent. At least she could use this Roaring Token to nag at the Queen of Punishment and make her feel uncomfortable whenever and wherever.</p>

  <p>She handed the token back to Luo Luo Zheng and watched him put it away. "Where did you get this Roaring Token?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Xun had used Roaring Tokens for tens of thousands of times in the past but she never thought this kind of token existed. She never thought someone would be able to create a Roaring Token that could be used for an unlimited number of times.</p>

  <p>"I've told you about the fairy palace, right?" Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>She'd heard about it but never really paid much attention whenever Luo Luo Zheng mentioned it. The fairy palace of the Lower World wasn't anything remarkable to someone like her.</p>

  <p>"I obtained this Roaring Token from the fairy palace. I might be able to enter that place again in the future. You'll know more about it by then," he told her.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't think the fairy palace would contain such a divine object. It seemed her perceptions were wrong and the palace itself was actually an extraordinary place.</p>

  <p>Just as they were talking, the entrance to Luo Zheng's small palace was thrown open with a bang.</p>

  <p>"Brat! I've been waiting for you day and night! Why do you still stay at this place?" the intruder roared as he entered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and threw a wink at Xun. She nodded her head and quickly slipped back into his body.</p>

  <p>Sighing, Luo Luo Zheng gathered his wits and prepared to meet the people in front of his abode.</p>

  <p>A group of warriors were gathered by the entryway. Luo Luo Zheng was already familiar with these types of situations but he was still perplexed as to why there were suddenly so many people in front of him. He had just entered the Mist Palace and had yet to make enemies so he didn't know what this ruckus was for.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he asked faintly, looking more annoyed than bothered.</p>

  <p>A warrior stepped forward. He was a tall and sturdy man who sported a fierce beard on his face. "My name is Jared Bi! The fourth most powerful warrior of the Ice Cloud House!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. "Oh? So?"</p>

  <p>Jared Bi's smile was not friendly at all. It was more predatorial considering how sharp his eyes got when he looked at Luo Luo Zheng. "I heard that you took a sword left behind by the previous leader of the Mist Palace," he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hummed and suddenly took out the aforementioned sword. The blade of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword glinted faintly in the light as he casually swung it around. "You mean this sword?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was no fool. He understood that Jared Bi came here to take his sword away. It was fortunate that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't in a hurry and had the time to hear what the warrior had to say.</p>

  <p>The sight of a first-rank divine weapon made all the warriors' eyes light up in awe.</p>

  <p>This sword was far stronger than any ordinary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>If enhanced just a bit more, it had the potential to be listed on the Universe Spirit Tablet!</p>

  <p>Jared Bi looked greedily at the sword in Luo Zheng's hand, "I'm in need of a good sword. I have to thank you for helping me fetch it from the Weapon House. I suggest you hand it over quietly or it's death for you, boy."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng almost laughed but he managed to hold it in. He swung the sword and played with it, briefly admiring the way the ripples on the metal caught the light. "I took this sword from the Weapon House on my own.</p>

  <p>If you want, you can go there and spend three hundred life vitality jades for a chance to obtain a powerful divine weapon."</p>

  <p>Jared Bi scoffed, "It seems you're not going to part with it willingly.</p>

  <p>Foolish boy!" he spat.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smirked. "And it seems you're not interested in leaving quietly."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Jared Bi exclaimed. "You don't seem to understand what the fourth most powerful warrior of the Ice Cloud House means! Do you really want me to teach you a lesson?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew there was no use talking to these idiots. He stepped up to this 'fourth most powerful warrior' who seemed to also have a giant stick up his ass. "Yes, I really don't understand," he said. "I don't understand how you can't seem to get that you're in no position to demand things from me. I will give you nine seconds to go away. Do you want me to teach you a lesson?"</p>

  <p>News of his acquisition of the sword had already spread through the entire Mist Palace like wildfire and it couldn't be helped that a lot of warriors had grown envious of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was a mere newcomer with the cultivation base at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Someone like him surely didn't deserve a fine weapon such as the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>A few warriors had thought of blinding this supposed greenhorn with money by buying it from him for a high price.</p>

  <p>Others wanted to take advantage of his newcomer status by threatening and intimidating him to give up the sword willingly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were those who wanted to simply steal the sword outright.</p>

  <p>Jared Bi was one of those people. Sure, he had first used the 'threaten and intimidate strategy' but since Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to be the cowardly type, he could only resort to outright stealing.</p>

  <p>The other warriors couldn't help but sigh. They had all gathered here with the same goal in mind: to take this amazing sword for themselves.</p>

  <p>However, Jared Bi had gotten way ahead of them and would most probably come out of this palace as a victor.</p>

  <p>They had no doubt that Jared Bi would severely beat Luo Luo Zheng up and take the sword. However, despite the roguish manner of obtaining the weapon, all of them felt that Luo Luo Zheng deserved to lose. It was solely his fault that he wasn't strong enough to defend himself against people like Jared Bi.</p>

  <p>Of course, none of them expected that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't someone to be trifled with. They were extremely shocked by the way he just condescended upon Jared Bi.</p>

  <p>Jared Bi couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Nine seconds, hahaha? I haven't seen such an arrogant junior for a long time? Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>His laughter was suddenly cut off by the sudden force that propelled him backwards. Everyone was witness to how Luo Zheng's figure suddenly flashed and slammed onto Jared's body, smashing his straight, strong chest onto the small palace wall behind them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood to the side and held onto the Thunder Wind Divine Sword tightly. "Nine seconds pass quite fast," he muttered indifferently.</p>

  <p>Everyone was gobsmacked at what they had just witnessed in front of them!</p>

  <p>"Such fast speed!"</p>

  <p>"He's crazy strong! Jared Bi was sent flying with just one punch!"</p>

  <p>"Jared Bi's strong but he's too arrogant for his own good!"</p>

  <p>They understood that Luo Luo Zheng might have possessed some sort of extreme strength since he was able to obtain the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>However, the fact remained that he was still only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm. There was no way he could fight against a Soul Sea Realm master. Or could he?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's lightning-fast punch had made everyone second-guess their assumptions for this young man.</p>

  <p>"I should have tested the sword's power just now?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered to himself, shaking his head in regret as he walked away from the scene.</p>

  <p>The power of this sword...</p>

  <p>His offhanded remark made those who heard it gulp in fear. If his punch had already been enough to heavily injure Jared Bi, what more could his sword?</p>

  <p>The thought hung over their heads as a threat. At that moment, they knew Luo Luo Zheng would not hesitate to kill anyone who got in his way.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to close the door behind him, a voice rang out through the entry hall, "Wait!" A short warrior had burst through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you money for the sword! I'll make sure the price will be fair and good!" the short warrior uttered.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "It's not for sale."</p>

  <p>"Three hundred thousand life vitality jades!" the short warrior exclaimed in one breath.</p>
