<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2151 Throwing Him Out (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>You can use the power generated from metal in order to make up for the lack, or the crack. In other words, if you make iron in your cinnabar field, it will automatically fix it. Although this method takes a lot of time and effort, it will eventually work out after performing it for a good ten thousand years. Anyway, a normal True God wouldn't be able to obtain the Taboo-breaking Pill."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Luo Zheng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze indifferent. His eyes were looking nowhere, yet everywhere at once.</p>

  <p>All of the proving godly warriors that had heard Luo Zheng speak felt dazed and confused, as they didn't understand what Luo Zheng was saying at all.</p>

  <p>"This guy is such a clown. He's just randomly making stuff up as he goes."</p>

  <p>"You know, some people just don't have much ability, but they sure are good at talking nonsense."</p>

  <p>"Talking crap like that in front of your teacher is just the same as courting death."</p>

  <p>Seeing that the old man surnamed Wu hadn't responded anything yet, though the proving godly warriors began whispering to one another.</p>

  <p>They were waiting in anticipation to see Luo Zheng thrown out.</p>

  <p>But the old man didn't budge. He stood in his spot, lost deep in his thoughts as he contemplated what Luo Zheng had just said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an idea flashed within his mind, as if a bolt of lightning had streaked right before his eyes, invigorating his soul. At that moment, his face flushed red and he looked abnormally agitated, as if he had grabbed onto some kind of lifesaving straw. He could no longer keep his tone calm and under control. "You, you said we could make up for it with iron. How much wood and metal would you say it needs, then?"</p>

  <p>Of the five elements, the melding of metal and wood would form the force of iron.</p>

  <p>"Thirty percent and seventy percent," Luo Zheng replied with confidence.</p>

  <p>"Thirty percent and seventy percent..." repeated the old man, as his voice trailed off. The old man acted as if he had been struck dumb, walking back and forth in front of everyone, contemplating the information he had just received. He had completely forgotten to control his demeanor in front of his disciples. His head was lowered in thought.</p>

  <p>The crowd looked at each other in confusion and a low mumble began to spread. They didn't know what was wrong with the old man, who suddenly seemed to be going insane.</p>

  <p>"Making up for it with iron... Filling the crack with... It's... It may be a stupid method, but it's a hell of a lot better than the Taboo-breaking Pill...</p>

  <p>This method, this method really works!" the old man exclaimed, now pondering the feasibility of the method in his heart. Ultimately, he was approving the method that Luo Zheng had offered.</p>

  <p>In order to earn more money and break down these two taboos, the old man had stayed in the Heavenly Han House as a teacher. According to his calculations, with that extra bit of salary, it would probably take him one or two divine eras to accumulate enough divine might coins.</p>

  <p>But according to Zheng's blunt method, it would only take him ten thousand years. This would greatly save time and would benefit countless low-rank True Gods who cultivated the Five Elements Godly Way in the future!</p>

  <p>"Who are you!? And where did you hear about this method?" The old man stared straight at Luo Zheng with bright, gleaming eyes. It looked as though he was trying to devour Luo Zheng with his sight.</p>

  <p>"I have a basic understanding of the Five Elements Godly Way. And I came up with this method on my own," Luo Zheng replied, cupping his hands anew.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible! I call bullshit! How can you have such a deep understanding when you are so young? You..." The old man looked at Luo Zheng with disbelief written all over his face.</p>

  <p>All the proving godly warriors and the two guards of the Heavenly Han House, were completely dumbfounded and couldn't believe what they had just heard.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, the old man had already said that Luo Zheng was a swindler.</p>

  <p>Thus, the other warriors only naturally treated him as such. Never, ever had they expected that with just a few short sentences, the old man's evaluation of Luo Zheng would change so drastically.</p>

  <p>As for the bald warrior still standing next to Luo Zheng, his expression was also that of disbelief, eyes wide and mouth agape.</p>

  <p>How could he have imagined that chasing away the guy beside him would have led to such a bizarre event? At the same time though, a bad feeling rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly continued, "Allow me to explain. What I have just said was not with the intention to laugh at you. It's just that I sat in the wrong seat and was slandered by this person. Besides, I never said that what you taught was bullshit and nonsense. That was also from the people who joined together to slander me. My only choice was to push the boat with the current."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng spoke, he pointed to the bald warrior standing beside him.</p>

  <p>The old man glanced at the bald warrior. Right now, it was no longer important whether or not Luo Zheng had been so rude. What counted was that Luo Zheng had pointed out a solution that no one had ever thought of before.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng had made such an explanation, the old man would take action, of course. Now it was the old man who pointed at the bald warrior before saying, "Throw him out. I don't want to see him ever again."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! As soon as these words left the old man's mouth, two figures zoomed toward the bald warrior. The two guards, one on each side of him, picked up the bald warrior and threw him out of the crowd.</p>
