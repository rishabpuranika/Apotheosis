<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 753 Sect-protecting Array (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At the end of it all, Eddie had abandoned the skirmish and given up on the competition for the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>That being said, there were still lots of warriors belonging to different sects as well as independent ones present in the arena, ones who didn't have any intention of letting the chance on fighting for the Dragon Soar Arena slip away.</p>

  <p>With all of that in mind, Dillon let out a smile and commented, "Eddie's two disciples have both been taken out. The remainder of the matches would have to proceed as planned, but as you may well see, the arena is currently in ruins..." As he gave those remarks, Dillon motioned to Hobbes with nothing but a simple nod.</p>

  <p>Hobbes then promptly exited the venue of the Martial Arts Contest without delay. And after some time, the crowd suddenly heard the thud of a couple of heavy clomps moving closer and closer.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Everyone focused their attention over toward the direction where the sound had been originating from, and a handful of onlookers were surprised to see Hobbes transporting the sizeable combat platform with his rotund frame and approaching them.</p>

  <p>This actual battle stage was close to being two hundred feet wide. For the purpose of resisting the power of the masters from the Internal Elixir Realm, it had been fabricated utilizing a method which was much too intricate. A few of the components were even heavier than gold and metal.</p>

  <p>And as for the weight of the whole platform, it was something quite breathtaking. Taking all of that into consideration, Hobbes just casually lifted it over his shoulders and moved it here solely with his pure brute strength.</p>

  <p>A loud sound reverberated in the area.</p>

  <p>And with a single intense earth-shattering thump, Hobbes had set the platform in place.</p>

  <p>The various sect leaders didn't even bat an eye upon seeing such a scene.</p>

  <p>For most of the masters from the Virtual Tribulation Realm, a feat like that wasn't out of the ordinary. But every single warrior watching from the stands had been left dumbfounded, causing the area to be overtaken by screams and squeals.</p>

  <p>The sect leaders proceeded to come back to their respective places on the high platform, each of them pondering deeply.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, a lot of people's wishes had been brought into fruition the moment Luo Zheng got rid of Marilyn for good.</p>

  <p>The prestige which some of the large sects had been enjoying in the past couple of years was only superficial. The truth was actually quite far from it. Due to Eddie's rapid progress and rise into fame, all of those aforementioned big sects felt as though they had been caught in a cataclysm. On top of that, even the World Commercial Alliance itself had been affected by it to some extent.</p>

  <p>Eddie possessed immense strength, and it would generally take about two to three sects' joint effort just to be able to take him down. And there wasn't actually just a single instance where he had clearly expressed his desire to build a divine kingdom. But given the complexities of the circumstances they were in, these great sects simply turned a deaf ear toward him.</p>

  <p>If Eddie were to have really put in place the Lustful Demon Array and stepped foot into the Soul Sea Realm, then none of those warriors in the entire Central Region could ever hope to stop him. During that period, be it was the Ethereal Spirit Sect or the World Commercial Alliance or the Cloud Hall, they would be forced to choose between one of two things: surrender to Eddie and live or stand up against him and meet their inevitable doom.</p>

  <p>With all of that in mind, Xander of the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance probably should be thanking Luo Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>Having said that, all the pressure had now fallen on Luo Zheng and the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the high platform, Imogen still had gloom written all over her face, and her wrinkles looked as though they had been carved into her face with a knife.</p>

  <p>Noticing Imogen's furious expression, Ning Yudie closed her eyes and came up to her and grabbed her arm. With such a sheepish voice, she told her,</p>

  <p>"Master, please don't be upset."</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to be angry?" Shaking her head, Imogen then said, "Of course! There's no use getting upset over such a thing. When the time comes that Eddie finally decides to come and to get even, how do you think the Cloud Hall would retaliate? How am I supposed to break it to the people residing in the Cloud Hall? What am I going to tell the millions of followers we have in the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>With the strength of the entire Cloud Hall combined, it still wouldn't suffice to be a match for Eddie. As the highest ranking cultivator in all of the Central Region, Eddie could singlehandedly lay waste to the Cloud Hall with great ease.</p>

  <p>Imogen herself was a master of the Life and Death Realm, but all her life, she had only been through one Heavenly Tribulation, and there was no telling if she would be able to make it through the one that was about to come. In addition to that, she would not measure up to Eddie in any way. If Ning Yudie were to somehow become fortunate enough to finish practicing the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, make her way across the line between life and death, and then finally end up being the master of the Life and Death Realm, she might have the chance to fight head-to-head with Eddie.</p>

  <p>But pulling off a stunt like crossing the line between life and death would be beyond any person's wildest imaginations. The things that lasted could never happen overnight. It would take too long for her to accomplish something like that.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie certainly understood that it was unwise to offend Eddie.</p>

  <p>The second she quickly moved to defend Luo Zheng, she had instantly been having second thoughts. What more could possibly become of the Cloud Hall if she displeased Eddie? When all was said and done, her feelings still got the best of her as she stood proudly in front of Luo Zheng despite the odds being completely against her. At that point, Ning Yudie truthfully couldn't care less if it would be worth all the trouble for the Cloud Hall just to keep Luo Zheng away from harm.</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes went dark, and a pang of guilt crept onto her face, "Forgive me� Master, maybe I am just really not worthy of being called the leader of the Cloud Hall. Maybe I'm not good enough."</p>

  <p>At the sight of the guilt embedded onto Yudie's face, Imogen heaved a heavy sigh and said, "Ahh, I'm well aware that you can be a bit too passionate when it comes to certain things, but one thing I know for sure is that the talent you possess is a cut above the rest. When you finally finish the cultivation of the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, you would then be on par with the Life and Death Realm warriors even if you're still at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Once you make it through the Life and Death Realm, I have faith that you would be capable of leading the Cloud Hall into being a fifth-grade sect, and potentially even helping the Cloud Hall to be counted as one of the sacred places."</p>

  <p>If a sixth-grade sect did not long for dominance, then it had the possibility of becoming a sacred place. If it competed for authority, then it would lay the foundations for its own kingdom of warriors. The kingdom would be known as the divine kingdom. Cloud Hall had no aspirations to fight for dominance. Its main goal was to become a sacred place, and that, more than anything else, would be the ultimate distinction one could ever hope to attain.</p>
