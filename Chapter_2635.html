<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Wight approached them menacingly, crawling on its hands and feet.</p>

  <p>In the past, it didn't seem to be moving very fast, and didn't seem like a threat in the eyes of Emily and the rest of the group.</p>

  <p>But now, it was clear that its speed wasn't that slow after all!</p>

  <p>"Awooo!"</p>

  <p>The Wight howled and rushed towards Emily.</p>

  <p>Emily stood straight, with her annular saber gripped tightly in her hand.</p>

  <p>The moment the Wight rushed to her, she suddenly stomped the ground, and her body rolled towards the Wight. She slammed the saber right on the Wight's head!</p>

  <p>The annular saber was actually ring shaped, with sharp blades lying both on the inside and outside.</p>

  <p>After successfully positioning the annular saber on the Wight's head, Emily twisted it in one quick motion, breaking the Wight's neck. Its head fell to the ground and rolled for a while before coming to a stop.</p>

  <p>Emily's action was fast and it was all over within a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>When the other exiles and the Wild Gods saw the scene, they couldn't help but applaud.</p>

  <p>Emily was very powerful. Even though her strength had greatly diminished and became ordinary like everyone else, her previous experience was still substantial, and her strength was undeniable.</p>

  <p>However, as she chopped off the Wight's head, a large amount of blood spurted from its neck. Even though she tried her best to avoid the stream of blood, it was difficult to dodge and her white clothes were now tainted with the blood.</p>

  <p>Initially, the group of exiles had felt cornered and hopeless when they saw the group of Wights. But after hearing Emily's words and seeing her kill a Wight so easily, their confidence began to return.</p>

  <p>Even if they lost their cultivation base, strength and soul forces, they still had their rich experience and years of practice of powerful martial skills!</p>

  <p>"Such Wights without wisdom are nothing! Everybody, go and kill them!</p>

  <p>Charge!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus roared as he rushed forward, bearing his saber on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Dragon Saber Skill!"</p>

  <p>With a twist of his saber, Timotheus cut a Wight's stomach like a dragon streaking through the sun. Then just as quickly, he pulled out the saber and spun it with both hands, making the saber twirl and spin. "Ching, ching, ching!" The heads of three Wights flew off simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Saber Skill was not only amazing and powerful, and it was also a joy to watch.</p>

  <p>"Is this saber skill also inherited from the Source World?" Zheng was fascinated by the saber skill. He didn't expect that these exiles not only had the strong cultivation base, but also cultivated the powerful basic martial arts.</p>

  <p>Besides Timotheus, Ramzi was also good at the spear skill. He controlled and brandished his spear so well that it was like his spear was an extension of his own hand, and the Wights couldn't get within thirty feet from him.</p>

  <p>More and more Wights kept surging out from the darkness like a nonstop tidal wave.</p>

  <p>The group of exiles all displayed astonishing martial arts techniques.</p>

  <p>They were like an indestructible dam, firmly blocking these Wights in front of them.</p>

  <p>But not much later, Zheng heard a scream from behind.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Wights had been quietly sneaking up from behind them as well.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, everyone's attention had been solely focused on the front.</p>

  <p>By the time they had realized what had happened, a large group of Wights had already surrounded them from behind.</p>

  <p>An unlucky Wild God from the Snake Goddess race failed to escape, and fell to the ground after being attacked by four Wights, all of which were biting hard everywhere they could reach.</p>

  <p>"Aimee!"</p>

  <p>Emily screamed as she turned around and saw the situation. Anxiety was written across her face.</p>

  <p>Aimee was an elite disciple of the Snake Goddess race. Her strength had become more and more astonishing in the past few years. In Emily's eyes, she was a very promising protege.</p>

  <p>Watching a disciple from her own race falling made Emily grow more and more anxious. But she had a number of Wights in front of her that she had to deal with. How was she going to help Aimee?</p>

  <p>Just at the right moment, a thin stream of light shot out.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, it landed neatly in the forehead of the Wight that was directly on Aimee.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a figure came running towards her direction. A few rays of sharp sword light shot out from the figure's hands, and almost immediately, holes appeared in the Wights' chests and necks and started oozing blood. Slowly, they fell off Aimee's body too.</p>

  <p>"Get up. You're safe now," Zheng called as he reached out his hand to Aimee, who was still lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>After the Wights' attack, Aimee's body was covered with wounds, but none of them were serious enough to be life-threatening. She was just in a very uncomfortable position.</p>

  <p>Aimee was still too stunned after the attack and being rescued by Zheng, so she didn't get up immediately.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?"</p>

  <p>From where she was standing, Emily was equally surprised to see this scene.</p>

  <p>Although the Wild Gods in this world had practiced martial arts, most of them practiced the skills to make preparation for their huge physical bodies. Those Wild Gods were not good at physical fights.</p>

  <p>Emily knew Zheng had come from a different world, but she didn't expect his swordsmanship to be so fantastic.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had ensured Aimee's safety, he pulled out the thin flying knife, and with a wave of his arm, he rushed towards the Wights again.</p>

  <p>'Most of these Wights are crawling. Although their speed is very fast, their necks are exposed...'</p>

  <p>With this thought in his mind, Zheng's long sword swirled in the air as it swept past the bodies of these Wights!</p>

  <p>Although the weapons prepared by Zelda were ordinary, the sword that Zheng used was also very sharp and handy for use.</p>

  <p>"Shing, shing, shing..."</p>

  <p>The sword cut through the necks of the Wights easily and left behind a trail of blood on them.</p>

  <p>Before those fierce Wights could move any further, their heads drooped and they fell to the ground, screaming. Their bodies were paralyzed, and all they could do was to lie there waiting for death to greet them as the blood drained from their bodies.</p>

  <p>The efficiency of Zheng's method was surprisingly impressive.</p>

  <p>Although there were a lot of Wights coming from behind, he rushed into them alone, with only his sword as company. In just a minute, there were about eighty Wights writhing on the ground after being attacked by Zheng.</p>

  <p>He alone had managed to block almost half of the Wights that had ambushed them from behind!</p>

  <p>Some of the other exiles had noticed Zheng's brilliant method. Previously, they had used a variety of methods to kill the Wights. They either penetrated their hearts, or smashed their heads, which was not very effective.</p>

  <p>But now, watching Zheng's technique of killing them simply by slicing their necks, they were given new hope. Everyone immediately saw the astonishing efficiency and began following suit.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, the group of warriors had slaughtered about four thousand Wights!</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo, woo..."</p>

  <p>Frighteningly, the number of the Wights did not seem to decrease, but kept increasing!</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>An elder from the Star Deer race suddenly yelled.</p>

  <p>The elder was being dragged into a large group of Wights. In the blink of an eye, he had already disappeared into their midst, with no sign of him at all. The others could only hear his repeated calls for help, which grew weaker and weaker before disappearing all together.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, another Wild God was also dragged away.</p>

  <p>More and more warriors were getting injured or killed, which upset the others and made them even easier targets.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Emily heavily cut the saber down and broke the neck of a Wight.</p>

  <p>As the blood splashed, her charming face turned into a determined, fierce expression. "This is not going to work out. We can't do this forever!"</p>

  <p>She walked around and called, "Timotheus, Ramzi, Lydia..." As she spoke, her gaze fell on Zheng who was fighting in the distance. In the same breath she continued, "And Zheng! All of you! Come here! Let's move forward together and kill those Wights!"</p>
