<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had fused with the symbols in the jade seal, his control over the space and time in the jade seal had been elevated to the next level, which was almost the same as he controlled his inner world.</p>

  <p>Just then, a dark red light film deep inside the jade seal caught his eye.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the light film was a pattern of a small black scorpion, and he could see a light dot that floated inside its see-through exterior.</p>

  <p>He then tried to break through the light film with his soul a few times but to no avail. In the end, he had to give up.</p>

  <p>In addition, he might not be able to kill the consummate True Gods in the jade seal with his current control of it. However, none of them could leave.</p>

  <p>Those consummate True Gods were important, as they were his bargaining chips to safely leave the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he glanced at Nelly, who sat on the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>His eyes traveled to her fair and slender legs, and he felt a bit restless.</p>

  <p>Nelly sensed his gaze on her. Her lips curved into a smile as she stretched her hand and gently pressed on the tree trunk. She took her shoes and jumped, landing barefoot on the platform where Luo Zheng was. At that moment, she splashed brilliant water drops at him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the water drops in front of him, he thought about stopping them, and all the water drops paused in mid-air. Then, the drops converged into a spiral formation and turned into a small water knife in his hand.</p>

  <p>Nelly slightly raised a fine brow.</p>

  <p>Such an ability could only be used in one's inner world. From the looks of it, it seemed that Luo Zheng had great control over the space and time within the jade seal. She couldn't help but be amazed.</p>

  <p>"We're leaving," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Although the time flow rate in the world they were in was much faster than that in the divine land, the Astronomical Transit Day would be over if they stayed there for too long.</p>

  <p>If the Astronomical Transit Day was over, then the Time Sea Forbidden Land would be closed and would not be opened until the next Astronomical Transit Day, which was in the next eight years.</p>

  <p>Nelly felt slightly frustrated at Luo Zheng's words and stayed silent for a while.</p>

  <p>How she wished that she could stay where she was now with Luo Zheng forever!</p>

  <p>A few moments later, she took her shoes and walked to him barefoot.</p>

  <p>She wasn't that tall, but her small body was full of strong energy. Her sincere eyes looked up at him and she said, "I want to ask you again. Is there really no way to resolve the hatred between the Mu Clan and the Luo Clan?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly taken aback before his blood ran cold. "I can spare Rachelle's life, but it doesn't mean that I will forgive the Mu Clan or Murphy Mu," he said icily.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Nelly had guessed that he would say such, so she didn't show disappointment. "Are we enemies, then?" she lamented.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, maybe not," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her lips parted slightly as if she wanted to say something, but he had already turned around and waved his hand.</p>

  <p>A halo with five colors immediately rolled out. Apparently, it was a passage that only Luo Zheng could build.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>His decision was final and nothing could change that. He could never forgive Murphy or the Mu Clan because after all, they tried to kill his father.</p>

  <p>Despite that, it didn't mean that he was immune to being sad at times.</p>

  <p id="top_2">He shook off his thoughts and stepped into the halo of light.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Nelly stared at his receding figure, the disappointment on her face now grew more obvious. Then, she closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, she breathed deeply and opened her eyes again. All the emotions reflected in her orbs were washed away.</p>

  <p>Her view of Luo Zheng had changed strongly these days, but it didn't mean that her personality did so as well.</p>

  <p>She would stick to her goals just like Rachelle. She would even sacrifice anything just to achieve them if it came to that.</p>

  <p>"Will there always be hatred?" she whispered with a pout. Her eyes, which were full of vitality, turned dark, and she immediately jumped into the halo.</p>

  <p>The path of space and time pulled Luo Zheng's and Nelly's bodies along with it, their limbs sliding gracefully along the light.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Zheng discovered a black insect crawling on a ray of light.</p>

  <p>The insect crossed a few rays of light and rushed straight towards him.</p>

  <p>With a slight move of his mind, the black insect stopped and moved in the opposite direction. Luo Zheng could also control the insects in this path of space and time.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He felt his body be stretched back to normal, before he finally appeared in the valley.</p>

  <p>In the center of the valley quietly stood the goddess who looked very much like Yan. It was no secret that the Goddess Statue had been destroyed because of the battle between the consummate True Gods and the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>Outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land The area was eerily silent as the Holy Beings all watched the small jade seal attentively.</p>

  <p>They had previously felt the wave after time had been devoured, and realized that someone had taken complete control of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>There was a slight tension in the air. All of them racked their brains in attempts to find out who had controlled the jade seal and think of ways on how to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>At that point, the light waved and all the Holy Beings stared harder at the jade seal. It was time to announce the result.</p>

  <p>All of the Holy Beings were stunned when they saw Luo Zheng appear in the halo of light. At the same time, they were confused.</p>

  <p>"How could it be him?" Samuel said, dumbfounded. He was truly shocked but also utterly doubtful. He even suspected that he might just be seeing things.</p>

  <p>While Joy couldn't believe what she saw either, she was also excited and overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"What about those consummate True Gods?"</p>

  <p>"He's the first one to come out! Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"The first person to come out doesn't necessarily have the jade seal in hand."</p>

  <p>"You're right. How could a mere low-rank True God compete with those consummate True Gods?"</p>

  <p>Now, the Holy Beings didn't know what happened in the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Besides, leaving it alone first didn't mean that one had truly obtained it.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings were still busy scrutinizing the halo, Nelly climbed out of it as well.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had left the world within the jade seal, the jade seal in his hand turned into an illusionary ball of light. He uttered a summon; then the jade seal on the ground swayed slightly and flew towards his palm.</p>

  <p>Finally, the two merged together into one.</p>

  <p>He slightly shook the jade seal, and its bottom layer disappeared. It turned into a small black snake pattern and floated on his palm.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, everyone's jaw fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land fell into silence.</p>

  <p>On one hand, Nicholas' face lit up as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible!" said a Holy Being with his mouth agape. Generally speaking, Holy Beings were supposed to be calm no matter what situation. This time, however, was different.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" Clark laughed boisterously. "Congratulations! Your Han Clan has so many talents! This guy is really promising! But it seems that you are very happy to give him to the Dongfang Clan. Nicholas, congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Samuel's lips twitched into a snarl at his words.</p>

  <p>No one had ever thought that just when a group of consummate True Gods tried so hard to win the jade seal, it eventually fell into the hands of a low-rank True God. It was really unexpected.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel suddenly had an idea which he thought was brilliant.</p>

  <p>It was known that Luo Zheng's identity was a troublesome matter. Regardless of whether he could get the jade seal or not, there was no way he could stay in the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Then again, Samuel was reluctant to give the jade seal to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo is indeed promising, but his identity is unclear. If he is really Mike's son, let's see how Nicholas is going to deal with him. But, he obtained the jade seal when he was still a member of our Han Clan. I guess it should still belong to our clan," Samuel said calmly. As he spoke, he looked at the leader of the Sun Blind race, who stood not too far away.</p>

  <p>It looked like what he said was meant for Nicholas, but in fact, he was speaking to the leader of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>Now everyone wanted to get the jade seal, but the Holy Beings couldn't fight for it right then and there.</p>
