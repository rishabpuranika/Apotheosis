<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng entered the inner circle of the Law Storm, no one could see him, but they could still feel his position and deduce how many miles he had covered. This was truly becoming an interesting spectacle to observe, and the palace leaders all followed Zheng's progress with bated breaths.</p>

  <p>The palace leaders were all extremely familiar with the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>When that palace leader had mentioned the flame pool earlier, the other leaders immediately understood what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>The flame pool was located at the 29, 800-mile mark. This was where the Immortal Profound Flame had been left by Supreme Lord of Profound Flame.</p>

  <p>In the chaotic war among several Supreme Lords many years ago, the Law Power that they had used had nearly torn the entire Orange Sea World apart. The remnant might of the Law Power reverberated throughout the entire supreme world, turning the Orange Sea World into a dead world.</p>

  <p>In the end, the alliance took a fancy to the Orange Sea World and used the remaining land as a training ground, while they named it Passing the Torch. The alliance had made the best use of the Orange Sea World's remains.</p>

  <p>The remaining Law Power had slowly evolved, disintegrating into various law fragments, and then finally intertwined together to form this massive Law Storm.</p>

  <p>However, not all of the Supreme Lords' remaining Law Power had disintegrated. Some of it still lingered in the Orange Sea World.</p>

  <p>The skills of some of the Supreme Lords were able to transcend both space and time, such as the Immortal Profound Flame.</p>

  <p>Even though it had endured for countless years and was engulfed by the Law Storm, the Immortal Profound Flame still maintained its exuberant state, burning fiercely within the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the Immortal Profound Flame hadn't been disintegrated at all, but rather that it had also been disintegrated into a considerable amount of Fire Law fragments. And these Fire Law fragments had also fused with the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>But even after so many years, when some of the palace leaders entered to investigate, they discovered that the flame pool still contained much danger.</p>

  <p>The flame pool would not have been worth mentioning to the palace leaders, but it was still something left behind by a Supreme Lord. For warriors at the Life and Death Realm or the Soul Sea Realm, it was like hell. Luo Zheng was going to face an obstacle the likes of which he had never dealt with before.</p>

  <p>Yolande, the other palace leaders and the lord of the Sunset World were well aware of it.</p>

  <p>That was why that palace leader had firmly told Yolande that it was simply impossible for Luo Zheng to reach 30, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>This was equivalent to letting a newborn child walk into a blazing fire.</p>

  <p>But Yolande confidently said that this child would be able to do so. This was a very laughable hypothesis!</p>

  <p>29, 600 miles...</p>

  <p>29, 700 miles...</p>

  <p>29, 800 miles...</p>

  <p>No one could see Zheng's figure, but they could all feel that he had stopped. At the distance of 29, 800 miles, he had stopped!</p>

  <p>"I've already said it before. Luo Zheng won't be able to pass it. Even if the Immortal Profound Flame only has one in a hundred thousand of its original power, he will still not be able to pass it."</p>

  <p>"I think this kid is probably busy worrying about the flame pool."</p>

  <p>"Actually, 29, 800 miles is far enough. I can guarantee that there will be no one who will be able to break the record any time soon. Not a single one! Luo Zheng has already won."</p>

  <p>These palace leaders weren't despising Luo Zheng, but they were rather relying on their own common sense to make a correct estimation and evaluation of him.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't say anything. There was no point in arguing. The key was that she wasn't sure, and was even slightly worried.</p>

  <p>She had been to the flame pool formed by the Immortal Profound Flame before. It was naturally nothing for her. However, with Zheng's cultivation level, no matter how hard he tried, it would be difficult for him to pass.</p>

  <p>She was afraid that Luo Zheng was too stubborn. Even though he clearly knew that his strength was insufficient, he still wanted to pass the flame pool.</p>

  <p>If he was seriously injured or even died in the flame pool, that would be such a tragic loss.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a man who couldn't be told his fate, but that did not mean that he would not die. It was just that no one would be able to deduce his fate.</p>

  <p>His life was a mystery. He had defied all the odds in his progress as a warrior, and was not someone who could be placed into a box. He was continuously redefining himself.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors at the side of the plaza, although they couldn't see Zheng's movements, the discussion had become even more intense now.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng must pass 30, 000 miles."</p>

  <p>"He has already reached 29, 000 miles. It will be such a travesty if he doesn't manage to make it through."</p>

  <p>"You guys know nothing! There's a flame pool there. Have you heard of it? A few years ago, there were still people who investigated the remaining power left behind by Supreme Lord of Profound Flame. It is said that even if a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior were to touch the flame, he would still be burnt to ashes. What do you think Luo Zheng is made of? Are you planning to let him swim through the flame pool?"</p>

  <p>They argued with each other intensely, as if the warrior in the Enchanted Barrier Tower weren't Luo Zheng, but themselves.</p>

  <p>After all, they knew they would by no means be able to compete with Luo Zheng. They were not even able to compare themselves to him. Therefore, there were some more objective points of view when they discussed about it.</p>

  <p>Layla, on the other hand, was sitting in a corner with her mouth pursed, looking like a wronged little girl. No one knew what was on her mind.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was indeed standing next to a huge flame pool.</p>

  <p>Although it was called a pool, the truth was that the flame pool was 200 miles long. It was already comparable to some of the large lakes of many great worlds.</p>

  <p>Within this flame pool, purple flames soared into the sky and directly cut open the surrounding Law Storm. They reached the dome of the Enchanted Barrier Tower, blocking Zheng's path forward. The air crackled with the lively energy present at the scene.</p>

  <p>"I'm completely unable to comprehend the Law Power within these flames. This Fire Law is at least beyond the fifth layer," Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood that the Fire Law definitely wasn't limited to just the fifth layer. After all, the Law Storm was the remaining might of Supreme Lords. And, the layer of laws comprehended by Supreme Lords was not something that Luo Zheng could easily imagine.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a trace of Life Law within these flames. This is really amazing!" Luo Zheng exclaimed in excitement at the discovery. The Fire Law represented annihilation, and was contrary to the Life Law. With these two laws fused together, it was easy to imagine just how difficult it was to create such flames.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to control the compressed Law Storm to a certain extent, but he was unable to control the flames in the pool.</p>

  <p>However, he had already begun to formulate a plan in his mind. The warriors outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower had spoken correctly, and Luo Zheng was planning to swim over.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's body was forged into a sacred weapon by Raging Fire, he was no longer able to find some suitable fire to temper his body further.</p>

  <p>To him, the flame pool before him was not a crisis but a lucky chance.</p>

  <p>He always relished the chance to prove himself and reach a new level.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, he would be able to improve his physical body once again with the flame pool and make his body into a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>If his physical body became stronger, the amount of dragon scales he would be able to bear would also increase by a level. It would clearly have obvious benefits for his strength development.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng felt some hesitation when he stopped in front of the flame pool.</p>

  <p>The flame pool was something left behind by a Supreme Lord. Perhaps the remaining might within it had weakened countless times over the years, but the purple flames still made Luo Zheng feel a brief tingling of fear.</p>

  <p>There was something ominous and threatening about the purple flames.</p>

  <p>Would his sacred weapon body be able to withstand the burning of these purple flames? Was he overestimating his skills? Would he soon face the music? Warriors were all endowed with a certain elevated sense of self, and though this was one of their best assets, it could also be their downfall.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had also understood that with his sacred weapon body, he didn't seem to be afraid of any flames. However, this time, the flames he encountered were completely different. And clearly more deadly!</p>

  <p>If he did not succeed and died here, it would be a tragedy. To have come so far and then fail was a tragedy which he could not allow.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng slowly walked to the edge of the flame pool. The closer he got, the more he could feel the fierce heat blowing against his face. Great, shimmering heat waves drifted lazily across the air.</p>

  <p>When he was still about 100 feet away, his clothing burst into flames and then turned into a pile of white ashes, scattering from his body. Flexing his powerful body, Luo Zheng struggled on.</p>

  <p>"These are the most powerful flames among all of the flames that I have ever come in contact with," he murmured appreciatively.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was both vigilant and hopeful in the face of the roaring flames. He knew that he was taking a risk, but there were some dangers that he had no choice but to face. His honor demanded it, and he didn't back down from a challenge.</p>

  <p>He slowly walked to the edge of the flame pool and stared at the violent flames as he extended his hand into the flame pool.</p>
