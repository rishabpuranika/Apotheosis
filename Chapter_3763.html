  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures in the ice city hid in every corner of the ice castles. From there, they observed the battle without having to worry about getting hurt.</p>

  <p>When they realized that Hosea had died, everyone was washed over with a wave of sadness.</p>

  <p id="top_26">Neal, the powerful Holy Soul Realm warrior of the Divine Farmer race, was no exception to this. He frowned and left quietly.</p>

  <p>Even if Hosea was not among the most powerful warriors of the Element Spirit race, he still held a special status. His death would mean the loss of the Blooming Jade Stage. Knowing this, Neal had to inform Divine Farmer as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Aside from a small group of the Souls of Light, most of the Other Shore creatures were at a loss. They had no clue what would happen to the Blooming Jade Stage. Should they retreat or would it be smarter to stay in the ice city?</p>

  <p>"Master Hosea really died..."</p>

  <p>"That human brat! It is all his damn fault!"</p>

  <p>"He killed Master Hosea!"</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the Five-Element Slaves were in a rage. At this point, retreating was not an option anymore, and they charged madly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, though the Five-Element Slaves were very powerful, they didn't have any high positions in the Element Spirit race. After all, they were merely slaves created by the Element Spirit race in the first place.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Five-Element Slaves rush towards him, Luo Zheng remained calm and unmoved. Because he could not put up a fight, he decided it would be best to dodge.</p>

  <p>With a light tap of his toe against the ground, he glided backwards to create distance. As he saw the Magical Thunder Slave in the front aiming for his head, his figure faded away and he exited the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"He ran away! What a coward!"</p>

  <p>"He retreated from the Other Shore again!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>Since their main target disappeared, the Five-Element Slaves did not know what to do. After all, they were only capable of carrying out tasks. With their leader dead, they did not know how to continue.</p>

  <p>However, their confusion did not last long. Not long after, a ray of white light shone, revealing a huge figure.</p>

  <p>Before, it took Luo Zheng much effort to eventually become the ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, the bald giant came from outside of the chaos. He had a skill for comprehending Sanskrit words, so understanding the token on the slate was a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>Once he returned, the bald giant gave the Five-Element Slaves cold looks.</p>

  <p>He ground his teeth against each other in anger.</p>

  <p>He hated the Element Spirit race!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With one deep breath, the giant smashed his fist directly towards the Moon Fire Slave that was in front of him.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves realized something was wrong. They began to flee and flail in all directions, running without thinking.</p>

  <p>But no matter how fast they ran, they could never escape the bald giant!</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump...</p>

  <p>The bald giant's first punch didn't hit the Moon Fire Slave, so he chased the slave down and began smashing his fist randomly.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves crawled like crippled bugs on the ground. With a hit, their armors and spiritual cores were smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Chill Ice Slaves had it a little better. Because they transformed into various flying forms and scattered in all directions. They were much harder to target.</p>

  <p>There still happened to be a few Chill Ice Slaves that were hit, but other than that, the rest were safe.</p>

  <p>As for the Magical Thunder Slaves, they were probably the safest among the slaves.</p>

  <p>The bald giant did not have an effective way to deal with them, especially because they launched attacks on his weakest body parts.</p>

  <p>However, these tactics only caused weak damage to the giant. After one round of the battle, the bald giant had no serious injuries, which sent the Magical Thunder Slaves to retreat.</p>

  <p>By the time Luo Zheng returned to the Other Shore, he saw that the Five-Element Slaves on the ice field had almost been killed by the bald giant.</p>

  <p>As for the other creatures on the Other Shore, a few decided to escape, while the others didn't intend to resist.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Phoenix and Li Bianxue didn't descend from upper ice field until they caught sight of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The central ice city has been taken. Anything else?" Luo Zheng asked them calmly.</p>

  <p>"It would be easy to occupy the remaining several ice castles," Phoenix smiled. "Besides, the bald giant became the stage ruler. Let's see if he has any interest in hunting down the Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>"I might as well ask him," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just then, the energy souls of Fuxi, Houyi, Emperor Di Jun, the Snake Goddess and the rest hovered over Luo Zheng's head again and began to sing their song.</p>

  <p>After he finished, Fuxi's face looked disgusted. "When the hell will this end?"</p>

  <p>Singing stupid songs was not part of what he signed up. He hated it, especially because no one could understand them.</p>

  <p>"Very soon," the Snake Goddess comforted him. "Primeval Lord of Heaven is training the rest. It won't be long until they take our places."</p>

  <p>The singing was necessary for Luo Zheng to communicate with the bald giant.</p>

  <p>Without the songs, the bald giant wouldn't have understood anything.</p>

  <p>Anyway, these songs were simple to create. They just needed to make some sounds that ordinary warriors could do. With this, the Primeval Lord of Heaven recruited some people in Luo Zheng's inner world to take the place of the elites who had helped Luo Zheng "pronounce".</p>

  <p>When the bald giant heard the singing, his eyebrows raised in interest. "The other several ice castles? I won't let go of anyone from the Element Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>The giant had a deep hatred for the Element Spirit race. There was no way he'd let them off so easily.</p>

  <p>Two thousand miles away from the ice city stood three ice castles, strategically connected to one another.</p>

  <p>These ice castles were meant to be the gathering places, second only to the ice city in the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>The news of the fallen ice city and Hosea's death had not spread yet, so the Five-Element Slaves in the ice castles were unaware of the crisis.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump...</p>

  <p>As the ice-covered earth trembled, the Other Shore creatures and the Five-Element Slaves made their way out of the ice castles.</p>

  <p>With a clear view of who coming over, their faces shifted from calm to anxious. Chaos struck, and everyone ended up shouting, dodging, and running as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the three ice castles were left to ruins.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, with the guidance of Phoenix, the bald giant charged towards the next nearest gathering place.</p>

  <p>It was in these three days that the Blooming Jade Stage was far from peaceful.</p>

  <p>Over time, the ice castles built by the Element Spirit race were completely destroyed to dust, all by the bald giant.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Five-Element Slaves and the Other Shore races who were obedient to the Element Spirit race suffered great losses. None of them had any good plans to deal with the giant, which led them to surrender. It was their only choice? death or retreat.</p>

  <p>The races on the Other Shore appeared innocent, but neither Phoenix nor Luo Zheng had any intentions of letting them off so easily.</p>

  <p>The fact that they joined the Element Spirit race meant that they had to stick to their stands. After all, if the Element Spirit race was ever in trouble, the creatures on the Other Shore would not hesitate to aid them.</p>

  <p>After three days passed and the chaos subsided, the bald giant carried Luo Zheng, Phoenix, and Li Bianxue to the front of the ice castle found in the deepest area of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>It was only a few days ago when the three were blocked in front of the castle. Now, they had the giant to carry them.</p>

  <p>At this point, the castle was empty and all the Five-Element Slaves that once guarded it retreated to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore. It was a ghost town here.</p>
