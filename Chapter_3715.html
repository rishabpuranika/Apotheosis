<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3715 One Thousand Feet To Pass The Test</b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Listen carefully," the Primeval Lord of Heaven muttered in an urgent tone.</p>

  <p>"Back then, I only entered Soul City three times before I was able to pass through. I was able to do that because of my comprehension of this song."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened in astonishment. "You were able to pass through after just three tries?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven beamed with pride. "Of course!"</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to pass the Soul City's test, but that didn't mean it was easy either. After all, only those who were able to reach Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore were able to enter the Soul City, which meant they had to have a certain level of talent and skill to be qualified.</p>

  <p>Every third-floor disciple of the Land of Sword Grief like Zhu Ge Feng, Carver, or Li Bianxue would also be considered a favored talent had they been part of any other super force in the Source World.</p>

  <p>So long as they worked hard and tried their best, they would eventually pass the Soul City's test. The only variation was the length of time it took for them to succeed.</p>

  <p>The fastest person in history to have passed through Soul City was the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's junior fellow disciple.</p>

  <p>The two of them had entered the Soul City for the first time on the same day. The Primeval Lord of Heaven passed after three tries while the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to do it after two. This was the main reason why the Primeval Lord of Heaven always thought his fellow disciple was way more talented than him.</p>

  <p>Their records remained unbroken even now.</p>

  <p>The song lingered in Luo Zheng's ears and he no longer cared whether he understood the lyrics or not. Instead, he chose to close his eyes and listened closely.</p>

   <p>Feng Ge was also listening with a serene expression on her face as she sat cross-legged on another pillar.</p>

  <p>Whilst everyone listened, a soul pillar began to rise. On top of this pillar was a member of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>This Separate Abyss member had a big build and looked somewhat funny on top of the pillar because of it. He had to carefully maintain his balance in order not to fall off.</p>

  <p>Since he was the first to enter the soul cloud, everyone's attention was on him.</p>

  <p>"That's Toby from the Separate Abyss race!"</p>

  <p>"He is ascending so fast! Is he determined to pass the test this time?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he is! He's already tried for more than one thousand three hundred times, right?" "Toby was a very promising member of the Separate Abyss race, but he's been stuck in Soul City for quite a while. His other race members laugh at him because he can't pass the test and the only way he'd get his prestige back is if he succeeds and passes through."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes also fell on the soul pillar as he heard everyone's discussion. As they said, the number displayed on the soul pillar was over one thousand three hundred.</p>

  <p>As the soul pillar rose, Toby got closer and closer to the cloud. He let out a growl before finally entering it.</p>

  <p>Numerous faces in the cloud rotated around the vortex where he entered.</p>

  <p>As Toby disappeared into the soul cloud, another number showed up on his soul pillar.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't need any explanation from Feng Ge. He quickly understood that this new number indicated the height Toby was at in the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>It seemed that after entering the soul cloud, Toby was able to rise in one go.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the number on the soul pillar continued to increase.</p>

  <p>Ten feet...</p>

  <p>Twenty feet...</p>

  <p>Thirty feet...</p>

  <p>Though it seemed as if his speed was slow, in the eyes of the Souls of Light in the Soul City, this feat was already impressive.</p>

  <p>"Toby has indeed made progress!"</p>

  <p>"He spent three seconds less on the first one hundred feet than last time!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Separate Abyss race will be gaining one more powerful warrior in the thirty-second stage of the Other Shore Realm!"</p>

  <p>It was a significant feat for one's Soul of Light to reach Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but there was no way a warrior would be able to become an Eternal Warrior due to the absence of a corporeal body.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan, Qiu Yinhe, and Goran all fell into this category.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, nobody really hoped to become an Eternal Warrior. Everyone knew it was an impossible dream in this era.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>The moment just before someone passed the test always garnered the most attention.</p>

  <p>After all, the Soul City opened every few days and not that many people were eager to pass the test. During times like this, everyone focused on one specific warrior to see if he'd be able to succeed.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the number on Toby's soul pillar broke through the nine hundred feet mark.</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and fifty feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and sixty feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and seventy feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and eighty feet...</p>

  <p>"He's about to reach nine hundred and ninety feet!"</p>

  <p>"Last time he got to around nine hundred and eighty feet. There's only ten feet left!"</p>

  <p>"Nine hundred and ninety! He's reached nine-hundred and ninety! Only ten feet left!"</p>

  <p>Toby only needed ten more feet to reach his goal of achieving the Colorless Soul!</p>

  <p>Just as everyone waited in bated breath for the number to reach one thousand feet, the soul pillar shook.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>They watched as a figure, thirty feet tall, came crashing down through the soul cloud, and slammed heavily onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Toby had failed yet again.</p>

  <p>There was a series of disappointed sighs as they looked at his unmoving form.</p>

  <p>"Alas, he was so close..."</p>

  <p>"He reached nine hundred and ninety-five feet! He was so close!"</p>

  <p>"Only five feet left, what a pity! He can only try again next time..."</p>

  <p>Whenever the test started, everyone would be given only one chance to ascend. There was no getting back on a soul pillar to try again for that round.</p>

  <p>The defeated Toby slowly got up and leaned against the soul pillar and cast a silent but sad look at the soul cloud above him.</p>

  <p>He had failed for more than one thousand times, but he took it in stride.</p>

  <p>Toby knew his own strength and that there was no way he'd be able to rise even half a foot more when he was up there. He'd have to work on himself more to pass the test sooner or later.</p>

  <p>After Toby's initial failure, a few other Souls of Light began to drive their soul pillars up through the cloud. Others still eagerly listened to the song in hopes of an epiphany.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be nervous for your first try, Luo Zheng. Everyone fails the first time," Zhu Ge Feng assured Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Carver echoed his sentiment. "Yes. There's no need to be nervous. Besides, even if this is your first time I don't doubt for a second that your performance will be extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>Being in the soul cloud wasn't a walk in the park. If one was not well-prepared, then he or she could end up in a miserable state.</p>

  <p>Hearing their words, Feng Ge, who had been listening attentively to the song, opened her eyes and gave them a frown.</p>

  <p>She was just about to refute what they said when a voice suddenly spoke.</p>

  <p>"Zhu Ge Feng, Carver, what nonsense are you two spouting?!"</p>

  <p>It was Li Bianxue. She turned to Luo Zheng and began to give him tips and warnings.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, the cloud is full of dangers. Don't be careless. You can't enter the soul cloud until you've comprehended the song to a certain degree. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you can jump down. It won't matter if you fail.</p>

  <p>Just don't ever force yourself to hold on!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's scolding was effective in zipping Zhu Ge Feng's and Carver's mouths into silence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding at her warning and continued to listen to the song.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Li Bianxue's soul pillar began to rise and send her up into the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>It was only her seventeenth time here in the Soul City but the speed at which she rose was remarkable owing to her outstanding ability of comprehension.</p>
