<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2769 A Phantom </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Without the slightest pause, Luo Zheng was pulled into the large hole by the strong current.</p>

  <p>After descending about ten thousand feet, he reached the bottom of the cave, which branched out in a horizontal direction.</p>

  <p>Then, along with the traction of the current, he began to advance horizontally.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The sound of black water surging into the cave could be heard clearly from behind, signaling that this cave had originally been a hollow and empty space without water.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had inadvertently opened the door to the cave by letting himself be swept up by the Devil, the cave was filling up with water.</p>

  <p>But why had the Devil forced Luo Zheng into this cave in the first place?</p>

  <p>"This cave..."</p>

  <p>It was hard for Luo Zheng to imagine that there would be a separate cave under the Sea of Meditation. The Sea of Meditation was located in the Abyss Demon Region, just like the Reincarnation Land. Where could this cave possibly lead to?</p>

  <p>Anyway, Luo Zheng thought that he would probably learn the answer in a short time.</p>

  <p>However, the size of the cave turned out to be far greater than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, he was still floating along the narrow cave with the Devil and the unknown creatures following closely behind.</p>

  <p>Every time the spiral current that enveloped Luo Zheng became weak, the Devil would release another current to continue to propel Luo Zheng forward.</p>

  <p>Although the size of the Scorching Gold that Sword Chen gave Luo Zheng was relatively large, it had been burning for quite a long time now.</p>

  <p>Now, it was barely the size of a small stone, and the light it was emitting had become faint.</p>

  <p>The unknown creatures behind him would probably swarm forward as soon as the light of the Scorching Gold went out.</p>

  <p>'With these creatures, it seems that I won't be able to reach the destination, '</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought with a helpless smile. So far in his adventures, Luo Zheng had almost never given up hope on survival. But this time, he really couldn't think of a way out.</p>

  <p>As soon as the golden light emanated by the Scorching Gold disappeared completely, the unknown creatures pounced on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to be swallowed by them, he heard a sharp cry from the Devil. The next moment, all of the unknown creatures quieted down and quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the unknown creatures were nothing but the Devil's soldiers that followed its orders.</p>

  <p>'So the Devil really is taking me somewhere, ' Luo Zheng thought, his guess solidifying.</p>

  <p>If the Devil really wanted to take Luo Zheng somewhere, it made sense that it would not allow the unknown creatures to swallow him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was quite surprised that the Devil could order the unknown creatures directly.</p>

  <p>This meant at least a few things.</p>

  <p>The Devil was a top unknown creature in the Sea of Meditation, and it was definitely intelligent. Of course, it was also possible that it was simply being manipulated by an intelligent creature that was more powerful than itself.</p>

  <p>Anyway, now that Luo Zheng knew that the unknown creatures wouldn't devour him, he relaxed and lay flat in the current, allowing it to transport him to somewhere unknown.</p>

  <p>A few hours passed.</p>

  <p>He heard a few roars that became louder and louder.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng released his spiritual sense again to find out what was in front of him.</p>

  <p>'Is the water becoming shallow ahead?' He was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>While he was pondering over this, he felt his body become light. Then, all of a sudden, he was propelled out of the black water by the spiral current.</p>

  <p>He flew a clear arc in the air before landing on dry ground.</p>

  <p>There was still darkness all around him. Now, he seemed to be in another long and narrow cave, but one without water.</p>

  <p>'Since there is no light here, I'll have to use my spiritual sense to explore the cave.'</p>

  <p>But just before releasing his spiritual sense, Luo Zheng patted himself on the head.</p>

  <p>Then, he reached his hand out into the air and squeezed lightly.</p>

  <p>A blazing flame appeared on his palm, immediately lighting up the surrounding space.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Luo Zheng was glad to be back on land.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash...</p>

  <p>With the light from the flame, Luo Zheng saw the waves of black water constantly rising and falling behind him.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be creatures wriggling under the water? no doubt the unknown creatures and the Devil.</p>

  <p>The Devil had brought him to this damned place and then urged him to enter the depths of this cave.</p>

  <p>A wry smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He looked around but found nothing special. Then, he raised the flame in his hand and walked deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>Without the shackles of the black water, he felt much more relaxed. Being in the black water was nothing like being in a normal sea.</p>

  <p>The pressure in the Sea of Meditation was just too strong. Luo Zheng could only exert twenty percent of his strength in the black water. Even Samuel had given up on chasing Luo Zheng after noticing the special quality of the black water.</p>

  <p>The cave was very deep. After walking slowly for a while, Luo Zheng spread out his thunder wings and flew forward at a rapid speed.</p>

  <p>Before long, a bronze gate appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The carving of the gate was very exquisite, but what made it stand out was its surface, which reflected different light rays, forming peculiar patterns.</p>

  <p>'Is this the base of the fiends?' Luo Zheng wondered inwardly with his eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>According to what Sword Chen had said, the fiends used the Sea of Meditation as their cultivation place, so it was reasonable to guess that this was their base.</p>

  <p>However, according to Sword Chen again, the fiends were not absolutely safe in the Sea of Meditation; the only reason they cultivated there was to gain some special power.</p>

  <p>If that was true, then the Sea of Meditation didn't belong to the fiends at all.</p>

  <p>And that must mean that there were more powerful monsters than the fiends.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked by his inference.</p>

  <p>The fiends were already extraordinarily powerful. What could be stronger than them?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was deep in thought, the bronze gate in front of him suddenly made a big noise and shifted a little, leaving a small crack.</p>

  <p>Looking at the thin crack, Luo Zheng took two steps back.</p>

  <p>The unknown creatures in the black water had already been terrifying enough. Who knew what was waiting for him behind this gate?</p>

  <p>As the crack got wider and wider, a figure appeared.</p>

  <p>"Why not come in since you are already here?" the phantom asked.</p>

  <p>'That's my voice!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows in surprise and looked straight ahead. With the light from the flame, he was able to see the phantom's face clearly; it looked just like him!</p>

  <p>"What a cheap illusion. Don't play such low tricks," Luo Zheng said coldly, staring at the phantom.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for even a True God to create an illusion incarnation.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng could create an incarnation with water by using the Parting Water Divine Dao, and it was very strong, far more powerful than the phantom in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think it's just an illusion?"</p>

  <p>The phantom in front of the door smiled faintly and stretched out a hand toward Luo Zheng before slightly flicking four of his fingers.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>The swords condensed by the forces from the four fingers shot toward Luo Zheng from different directions.</p>
