<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These flame kittens were quite not big. But since they were born in the middle of this lava lake, they were considered as terrifying Law Creatures. The power those flame kittens had must be incredibly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, how could the Lava Giant take these flame kittens as its food?</p>

  <p>Some said that the little flame kitten was primarily a by-product of the Lava Giant. But the reason for having it shaped into a cat form was still unknown.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng claimed that it was indeed a good idea to use these flame kittens to attract the Lava Giants' attention.</p>

  <p>But it looked like that dealing with these flame kittens was not like a piece of cake!</p>

  <p>Not far away from the magma lake, there was an emission of small ripples creating magma bubbles. Once a magma bubble appeared on the surface, it automatically opened up, revealing a little flame kitten as it popped out. It looked so adorable when it let out a soft purring sound!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others could only stare openly at the flame kittens.</p>

  <p>They all realized that it was indeed troublesome to capture the little flame kitten before using it to attract the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>But since this was the fourth Hall of Causality, such a challenge was too quite common.</p>

  <p>"I can try, but I can't guarantee success," Janet broke the silence, as she indifferently stared at the little flame kitten. And with a graceful flip of her hand, a divine wood materialized in her palm.</p>

  <p>Although she majored in the Wood Law, she was also skillfully proficient in the Ice Law.</p>

  <p>The divine wood kept twisting and turning in a mesmerizing motion until a layer of frost gradually covered its branches, like magic!</p>

  <p>"The Lofty Wood is all-powerful. It can turn into a fire and ice."</p>

  <p>This time when Janet decided to step into the Illusion Battlefield, she dismissed the notion of bringing along any supreme divine weapon from her clan with her.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that her clan didn't own any supreme divine weapon, but that Janet didn't need one.</p>

  <p>Her body was equipped with a piece of wood that served as her weapon.</p>

  <p>And its grade was comparable to a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>That piece of wood was called the Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>They said that there was a tree resembling an ox. Its skin looked like tassels or a yellow snake that could be drawn out with so much ease.</p>

  <p>The leaves of this tree were like nets. It also grew yellow flowers with four petals, flourishing in large terminal panicles. During autumn, its fruits that were similar to a three-part inflated bladder-like pod ripened.</p>

  <p>That tree was slightly heart-shaped at the base, with seven to fifteen teeth along each side, and a dark green upper surface. That was the well-known Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>Legend said that the universe created a towering tree named the Lofty Tree, with a divine destiny that ascended to the heavens!</p>

  <p>That piece of the Lofty Wood was inside her body since she was born.</p>

  <p>Initially, her clan had wanted to take it out, thinking that it was an extraordinary item. It was something to be considered rare and sacred even to the Ji Clan. If that piece of wood were refined, it would be enough to create a supreme divine weapon ranked in the top 500.</p>

  <p>However, when the Ji Clan members tried to extract the Lofty Wood out of Janet, they realized that she seemed to have a special connection with the wood.</p>

  <p>This Lofty Wood had a soul, which resisted leaving Janet. The day when the Ji Clan was forcefully extracting the wood, a bolt of twelve-colored dragon-shaped lightning shot across the sky and split the entire Ji Clan's mourning hall into pieces.</p>

  <p>Under this kind of strange phenomenon, the Ji Clan gave up right away on taking the Lofty Wood out from Janet's body.</p>

  <p>Janet grew up and so did the Lofty Wood inside her body shell. It became a weapon she could not part with as they were inseparable.</p>

  <p>As for why the Lofty Wood was born in Janet's body, or why it would lead to such a strange phenomenon when it was about to be taken out of her body, the Ji Clan had always kept these things a secret and never brought it up to the outside world. It was also a big secret of the Ji Clan up till now, and even Janet herself did not know what was behind the big secret.</p>

  <p>"Ice and fire can restrict each other. I can try and trap the little flame kitten with ice! But... who's going to attract the flame kitten?" Janet asked.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Coleman who had been hiding outside the hall for a long time had returned. Everyone's eyes were focused on him.</p>

  <p>"Me? I'm not going!" The enormous head of Coleman shook in fear like a rattle drum.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey turned to look at Coleman with disdain and exclaimed, "Let me go!"</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," Luo Zheng said as he stood up.</p>

  <p>Although the Fire Law in this Hall of Causality was out of the ordinary, Zheng's divine weapon body could withstand the Fire Law's power. He wasn't sure if he could endure the burning of the flames, but he still had quite a bit of an advantage over Jeffrey and the others.</p>

  <p>As the leader of their team, Luo Zheng had stepped forward and volunteered.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey couldn't have any objections.</p>

  <p>Afterward, everyone cautiously retreated for about 100 feet. Then with a light wave of Janet's slender fingers, the Lofty Wood fell to the ground, and then leaves sprouted shortly after as the branches intertwined and formed a small cage. The Frosty Cage released cold airflow, causing the temperature in the surrounding area to drop excessively lower.</p>

  <p>Then after setting up the Frosty Cage, Janet and the others swiftly retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng casually walked towards the edge of the magma lake, and with a slight flick of his toes, a rock fragment flew up from the ground, and he caught it in his palm in the process. He firmly held this small rock in his hand and resolutely stared straight ahead.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of this magma lake, there were probably innumerable flame kittens.</p>

  <p>In parallel with the bursting of the magma bubbles, one could always view these nimble little things that emerged from the magma. It seemed like they popped out to play for a while before diving back into the magma to hide.</p>

  <p>"Boh!"</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, not far in front of Luo Zheng, another small bubble of lava exploded, and a flame kitten got its way out.</p>

  <p>"Meow�"</p>

  <p>The kitten stretched its body as the fur formed from the fire danced incessantly. This adorable looking little fellow, however, was an extremely ferocious being!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>With a light flick of Zheng's finger, the stone in his hand shot towards the little flame kitten!</p>

  <p>Just as the stone was near the little flame kitten, it melted halfway. But it seemed to have attracted the little flame kitten's attention.</p>

  <p>Everyone held their breaths momentarily for three seconds as they stared fixedly at Luo Zheng in the distance.</p>

  <p>Janet pursed her lips. Although the Lofty Wood was a divine weapon, her current cultivation was still limited. She did not know if the Frosty Cage formed by her Lofty Wood could imprison the little thing.</p>

  <p>"Meow �"</p>

  <p>The little flame kitten let out a soft chirp as its pair of cat eyes glanced at Luo Zheng indifferently. It then rolled over and swiftly submerged itself into the magma!</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not believe what his eyes saw.</p>

  <p>And Coleman wanted to show that he was even worse off! How could there be such a big difference between him and Luo Zheng? Earlier, Coleman had no intention of provoking the little flame kitten, but the little thing was relentless in pursuing him. This little flame kitten in front of Luo Zheng, however, was surprisingly tame. And it couldn't be bothered with Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>With this, one could assume that not only did these Law Creatures have intelligence, but also every single one of them had their unique personality as well.</p>

  <p>Alas! If the first one failed, they must figure another way to find their next target.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing, though, that there were quite a few of them. Then sooner as expected, another flame kitten floated up, following a gush of boiling lava.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng showed no mercy and deftly circulated the chaotic energy within his body, creating three cold icicles formed in his hand. And with a quick flip of his hand, the icicles shot towards the little flame kitten!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The three icicles instantly alerted the little flame kitten.</p>

  <p>With a roll, the fiery fur on its body swelled up as it let out a mournful cry at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng didn't primarily cultivate the Ice Law, all of his Original Laws had been trained all at the same time. An ice awl powered by his chaotic energy, even if it didn't contain any other profound mysteries, was still absolutely extraordinary!</p>

  <p>However, the little flame kitten didn't dodge at all and directly crashed into the three icicles with its seemingly soft body.</p>

  <p>Before the icicles could pierce into the flame kitten's body, they had turned into wisps of water vapor and disappeared into the dry cave in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>The temper of this flame kitten was quite irritable. After the icicles disappeared, its momentum didn't diminish at all. The flames on its body burned brighter and brighter as it charged towards Luo Zheng, the culprit!</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Since he had already made the arrangements, Zheng's expression was calm as he began his orderly retreat.</p>

  <p>The flame kitten, on the other hand, was visibly growing in size. The small-sized flame kitten had now turned into a flame leopard!</p>

  <p>Seeing that scene, Janet raised her eyebrows as she pulled herself to step back. She then gently waved her finger, making the Frosty Cage on the ground to shake non-stop. Soon after, it started to grow again. Just now, the Frosty Cage that she condensed using the Lofty Wood was too small.</p>

  <p>And with the sudden increase in the size of the flame kitten, she quickly adjusted the size of the Frosty Cage.</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>The flame kitten viciously chased after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>From afar, a man and a cat were both incredibly fast!</p>

  <p>Within a fraction of a second later, a distance of a hundred feet was already covered by the two. Zheng's figure swiftly flew past the Frosty Cage that had been transformed from the Lofty Wood!</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>Janet wore a solemn expression as she extended her ten fingers. Under the connection of her mind with Lofty Wood, the Frosty Cage suddenly opened and went straight for the little flame kitten behind Luo Zheng.</p>
