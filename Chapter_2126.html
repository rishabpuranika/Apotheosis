<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2126 The Village Leader (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>A small pebble in the divine land weighed about five hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>Combined with Zheng's insanely powerful kick, it could shatter anything it hit.</p>

  <p>The martial artist at the helm couldn't say anything that threatened Luo Zheng, so another martial artist beside him wanted to say something. After all, the Sun Moon Village backed them� they had no reason to be afraid.</p>

  <p>But just as that martial artist was about to speak, Zheng's foot kicked another stone and hit the martial artist's jaw accurately.</p>

  <p>"Tack!"</p>

  <p>Of course, his jaw had been broken.</p>

  <p>When the other martial artists saw the scene, they didn't dare to threaten Luo Zheng. All of them remained quiet in fear of Luo Zheng, who might kick a stone that would smash their faces as well.</p>

  <p>"You guys deal with these people," Luo Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Misty Mountain Village's people all wanted to kill those warriors and they shared the same sentiments among each other. "They killed two of us!</p>

  <p>We have to avenge them!"</p>

  <p>"Kill them!"</p>

  <p>Those who had killed others must die� such was a principle that was universally accepted in the entire world.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the angry villagers tightly held on to their spears and charged toward those warriors.</p>

  <p>Although the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village were kind and honest, they didn't show the slightest mercy to the murderers who killed the members of their village.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the opposite side immediately ran for their lives at the sight of the Misty Mountain villagers despite their broken wrists, courtesy of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, just as they turned around, Luo Zheng stomped his foot on the ground and kicked the stones beneath his feet one by one.</p>

  <p>The tiny stones that were filled with great momentum were accurately shot at the crooks of the warriors' legs, which caused their bones to break quickly.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, all of them had fallen to the ground.</p>

  <p>They couldn't run after their legs had been broken either, so the only thing they could do was to crawl.</p>

  <p>Because of their slow speed, the members of Misty Mountain Village with their long spears were able to catch up to them and swarmed all the enemy warriors. The rest was history.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he did not stay to watch the bloody scene. The truth was that he had rarely killed anyone ever since he had ascended to the Upper World. Then again, it wasn't such a cruel thing to kill people if it was in a high-level battle and besides, the blood that was spilled during such a time wasn't actually that much.</p>

  <p>After the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village had dealt with the warriors from the Sun Moon Village, they buried their members' corpses.</p>

  <p>Only then did the furious villagers begin to grow fearful.</p>

  <p>In reality, no one had actually died even since the start of the conflict between the Misty Mountain Village and the Sun Moon Village. The Sun Moon Village previously just beat up a few people from the Misty Mountain Village and ordered the rest of the villagers to leave their place within a definite time.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that when the time came, the Sun Moon Village came over to kill people. If it wasn't for Luo Zheng, the Misty Mountain Village's members would have already been massacred by the warriors from the Sun Moon Village.</p>

  <p>Later that day, the senior members of the Misty Mountain Village gathered together in the largest house. Needless to say, all of them looked troubled as they discussed how to deal with the Sun Moon Village. They killed the warriors of the Sun Moon Village, which meant that they had resisted the Sun Moon Village's attacks. However, they would be in great peril as well if the leader of the Sun Moon Village raided their place and attacked them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng sat in the corner of the house with his eyes tightly shut.</p>

  <p>He silently circulated his blood to hit the black threads in his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>He had been unable to connect with his inner world after being bound by the black threads. During that time however, he had faintly sensed that something had happened within his inner world, and it made him quite anxious.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in his inner world flowed extremely fast. Usually, he pried into his inner world after he cultivated for a few hours to prevent the creatures in it from starting a dispute. There would be some races that occasionally waged a war and wanted to carry out large-scale massacres, but Luo Zheng normally stopped them in time.</p>

  <p>Yet after his cinnabar field had been sealed for a period of time, he had no way of knowing his inner world's progress and whatever happened inside it. He could only figure out such things once he got rid of the black threads.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the discussion among the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village started to get louder. "We might as well leave here!</p>

  <p>If the warriors of the Sun Moon Village come over to kill us, won't all of us have to die?" "Leave?</p>

  <p>Why do we have to leave? From generation to generation, this place has belonged to our Misty Mountain Village. We can't just let them occupy this place. They are just too unreasonable!"</p>

  <p>"Our Misty Mountain Village is remote and we are not rich, but why do the people of the Sun Moon Village still want to occupy this place? I think they just want to cause trouble!"</p>

  <p>There was indeed, nothing important about their village.</p>

  <p>In addition, the outside of the Misty Mountain Village was just a flat and wide vegetable patch. What could the Sun Moon Village want from that vegetable patch?</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of? We can just let Tianxing attack and destroy the Sun Moon Village," one villager shouted. When the rest of the villagers heard those words, they all turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was their only hope. The question was whether Tianxing was willing to take such a huge risk to help them fend off the Sun Moon Village.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Woolley and Thomson sat by the side without saying anything.</p>
