<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3001 The Destroyed Sword Dance Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The young man with long hair looked even more ferocious when he saw that Ingram had arrived and stopped Zheng.</p>

  <p>He screamed, "Ingram! Crush him! Kill him! Just like the way you would kill an ant!"</p>

  <p>The youth with wild long hair was Faegan Qiu. Even though he was not a very powerful martial artist, he held an honorary position in the Qiu Clan hierarchy. That was why he had the audacity to command Ingram to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene, Kenelm and his friends started to get jittery. If the leader of the palace took the matter seriously, Zheng would definitely land himself in big trouble.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they could not ignore the fact that Zheng caused such a ruckus because he stood up for them. Kenelm cupped his hands towards Ingram and said, "Master Ingram, Zheng just stood up for us. Hence, we all are willing to take up any punishment bestowed on us. Please leave Zheng out of this."</p>

  <p>Ignoring their remarks, Ingram continued to stare at Zheng, as he said, "You just joined the Sword Dance Palace. But in just a short span of time, you managed to injure so many disciples! You are bold!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said calmly, "I am well versed with the rules of the Sword Dance Palace, all thanks to that friend, standing over there."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed to the man in cyan not far away.</p>

  <p>The man looked stunned when everyone's attention was drawn on him. He was afraid that he would be blamed, so he quickly feigned ignorance and said, "Me? I merely informed him that warriors could spar with each other, as long as they don't cause any death. That's the rule we always follow in the Sword Dance Palace."</p>

  <p>The man didn't expect that Zheng would create such a scene and put him in the spotlight!</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at Ingram and said, "That's a fine rule! Truth be told, no one died today. Even if the disciples of the Sword Dance Palace were seriously injured, they will recover instantly with some treatment."</p>

  <p>Most of those disciples were consummate True Gods. Zheng had made conscious efforts to avoid making fatal impact on their bellies and souls. He knew they would regain their strength, no matter how seriously they were wounded, especially when they were in such a powerful place like the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Ingram stared at Zheng for a while. Suddenly his expression cleared, as a thought crept up.</p>

  <p>Zheng was sent here by Laura. She was in charge of the thirteen cultivation palaces under the Sword Light Palace. She should be well aware about the chaos of the Sword Dance Palace. Was there any motive behind her sending this man here?</p>

  <p>The young men from the rich clans were unruly and arrogant. They always refused to pay heed to others. This guy gave them a tough lesson to learn, though it was at the cost of their blood. In that case, it was actually a commendable deed!</p>

  <p>"Ingram! Why are you standing there as if you have lost both your ears!</p>

  <p>Didn't you hear me! I asked you to kill him!" Faegan furiously said with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Ingram calmly turned his head and said with a smile, "This new disciple, who goes by the name Zheng, hasn't violated any rule of our Sword Dance Palace. Then why should I kill him?"</p>

  <p>"How dare you defy my command. It is my prerogative to impart any rule in the Sword Dance Palace! You just tell me whether you have the guts to kill him or not?" Faegan roared louder, as the others cringed nervously.</p>

  <p>A ruthless aura flashed across Ingram's eyes when he heard Faegan's rude words. He patted gently on the golden egg shell at the surface of Faegan's body. The golden egg shell was anyways on the verge of breaking. That was why, with Ignram's mere pat, the shell broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Then Ingram patted him on the shoulder and said with a smile, "You and I are both from the Qiu Clan. Back then, I was a hundred times more bossy and ruthless, than what you are right now. But there was one thing that differentiated both of us. No matter how strong my opponent was, I would always fight back on my own. You must also do the same. Put in your own efforts to save your face!"</p>

  <p>Then he strode out without even glancing back.</p>

  <p>"You, you, Ingram... I will ensure your behavior is reported to my father!</p>

  <p>You proved that you are a loser of our Qiu Clan! You even didn't help your clansman. You were entrusted to this small palace for the sake of that bitch.</p>

  <p>You deserve it!"</p>

  <p>Faegan was furious to see Ingram ignoring him. He continued to curse as he saw Ingram's retreating figure.</p>

  <p>Just as he was crazily cursing, Ingram suddenly turned back. His original benign and calm face, instantly had a murderous look. His eyes were blazing with anger.</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart trembled at Ingram's voice, and he flew backwards.</p>

  <p>An invisible force rolled out from both sides of his arms, sending Kenelm and his friends over a thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng retreated, Ingram suddenly shouted, "Get out!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The earth trembled and the mountains shook.</p>

  <p>Ingram's roar was heard by half of the divine citizens of the Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>Half of the Sword Dance Palace was already destroyed before, and now the other half was also flattened by the spreading shock waves.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng had managed to drag Kenelm and his friends over a thousand feet away, they were still bleeding from their noses, mouths and ears, because of the terrifying shock waves.</p>

  <p>As for Faegan, he looked as if he had been ripped apart from the bones. He was covered in blood and every inch of his body was badly wounded.</p>

  <p>In fact, Ingram had controlled his energy. If it weren't for the fact that they were both from the Qiu Clan, Ingram would have pulverized him into ashes with his roar.</p>

  <p>The two men in cyan clothes were too frightened to even move. They just slumped to the ground in shock. They had never seen the leader of the palace get so angry before.</p>

  <p>It took the whole of three days to rebuild the destroyed Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>The young disciples from the rich clans in the Seven-Star City who were wounded by Zheng were sent back to their respective clans for treatment.</p>

  <p>Although their injuries looked frightening, they were not fatal. Among them, Faegan was the one who was most seriously injured. Even his soul had been greatly damaged. However, this time, Zheng was not the one who caused his injuries, but Ingram.</p>

  <p>The new comers of the Sword Dance Palace had been assigned places for their rest and stay.</p>

  <p>However, Kenelm and his friends continued to feel uneasy. After all, they had offended everyone since the time they landed here. What if they changed their mind and prosecuted them? But all his worries were put to rest.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night, Zheng leaned on the balcony of his residence, looking up at the starry sky.</p>

  <p>The night in the Seven-Star Province was extremely beautiful. Above his head, there were stars as big as a fist, shining with brilliance.</p>

  <p>These stars were moving extremely fast, and they circled the sky once in just a few seconds. No one knew what kind of mystery was there in the sky of the Source World that it could produce such a miraculous scene.</p>

  <p>"What the hell am I doing here?" Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>Zheng had merely agreed to the woman's invitation because of a whimsical idea of No. 9527. He didn't see any point in joining this hell place. The Sword Dance Palace was rubbish and it was a complete waste of time for him to stay here.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any special reason. Joining a human force is always safer than you roaming around aimlessly," No. 9527 replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you had planned for me?" Zheng complained.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 hardly regretted its decision. It inquired, "What is the problem?</p>

  <p>What can you do with your current strength? You are still insignificant in any place of Source World. Other than making yourself stronger, is there any other way?"</p>

  <p>"At least you could have selected a decent place and not this rubbish heap!</p>

  <p>This Sword Light Palace is just nonsense!" Zheng complained.</p>

  <p>"The Ancient Scorpion race in the Source World owes my master a favor. If you go to the Ancient Scorpion race, I can help you get a good position, but would you be fine to live among those stinging scorpions?" No. 9527 asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips and didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of strange races in the Source World, and most of them weren't even humans.</p>

  <p>Besides, Zheng was not capable of crossing a province. Since he had joined the Sword Light Palace, the only option he had was to stay and face the challenges.</p>
