<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4268 Rescue (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since he came into existence, the brush-wielder had regarded himself as the God of the Wall World, and he had a very strong obsession with it.</p>

  <p>If the downgrader would really turn the entire world into a Wall World, then he couldn't be any happier. It was what he wished all along.</p>

  <p>Originally, Luo Zheng wanted to persuade the brush-wielder into helping him.</p>

  <p>However, as he heard all the crazy words that the brush-wielder had spouted, Luo Zheng knew that it would never happen. He was so disappointed and angry at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Even if he really turns everything into a Wall World, what do you think would happen to you? Do you think he would let you live? Can't you see that you're just being manipulated too? Did you even see the miserable state that Cornelius ended up with?!" Luo Zheng wasn't able to contain his emotions as he tried to drill some sense into the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if I'm being manipulated! All I ever wished is the establishment of the Wall World!" the brush-wielder shouted as he closed his mind to everything that Luo Zheng was saying. "Too bad for you, I won't let you leave this place! You shall die here today!"</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, thus he didn't dare underestimate him. But right now, he would do everything in his power to eliminate him within the bounds of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>With that, a huge ink brush emerged above the Eternal Scroll Painting, which quickly sent down a stroke that sharply slashed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the brush slashed, a long trail of ink swept across the snow-white painting scroll.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng instantly sensed that the strong force was about to slash his waist.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Eternal Scroll Painting was not a real Wall World yet, meaning that Luo Zheng's body maintained its strength as it was in the third-grade world.</p>

  <p>Before they waged the war against the Snake Spirit Sect, Luo Zheng's body had already been greatly strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline. He could withstand even the most powerful physical attacks.</p>

  <p>Slash! Swish! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder threw vicious attacks in rapid succession. He kept on slashing Luo Zheng over and over with his sharp strokes.</p>

  <p>The black ink almost covered the entire white scroll due to the number of attacks hurled at Luo Zheng, but it appeared that his body was still unscathed.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Is this the power of the ancestry-level bloodline? How could your physical body withstand such attacks?"</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder temporarily halted his attacks as he saw that all those strokes didn't even cause a scratch on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>With that, he changed his approach. The ink brush was held high in the air, and beams of golden lights emerged from the shaft of the brush. The ink at the tip of the brush was tinged with golden yellow, making it look even sharper.</p>

  <p>"Take this! Demonic Strokes!"</p>

  <p>At his command, the ink brush started violently smearing Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Wisps of golden yellow strokes began covering the previous black stains, creating a messy artwork on the surface of the scroll.</p>

  <p>With the abundance of ink spilled everywhere, it was actually hard to tell where Luo Zheng was if he remained still.</p>

  <p>Only when he moved slightly to dodge the attacks would his form separate from the ink marks on the scroll.</p>

  <p>No matter how savagely he was attacked by the brush-wielder, Luo Zheng still kept his calm, knowing that his superior physical strength would overcome every attack thrown at him. Soon enough, the brush-wielder trembled in anger and frustration at the sight of Luo Zheng's undamaged body.</p>

  <p>He was exasperated by the fact that he already poured a lot of effort, but it didn't affect Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>"Don't think that I'm done yet! You will die by my hands. You'll see!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the ink brush that was floating in the void suddenly disappeared, and what surfaced in place of it was a huge graver.</p>

  <p>At a glance, its appearance might look simple and austere, but Luo Zheng perceived that it should be something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng couldn't see anything outside the scroll painting, but he could clearly sense the sharp aura that the graver was emitting.</p>

  <p>However, since he was trapped inside the painting, he couldn't do anything except dodging attacks. He was currently at the mercy of the brush-wielder. Although he might be able to dodge some of his attacks, he couldn't totally escape from him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Without any warning, the graver slashed down towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>A trail of blood appeared on the scroll, covering the previous black and golden ink marks.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked, he saw that a deep wound was inflicted on his body. His flesh was ripped open that the surface of his bone was already visible.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Did you feel that? This is my Life-energy Graver. Every time I use it, it consumes my life energy. Can you imagine that? I'm attacking you at the cost of my own life!" The brush-wielder was acting crazier this time. It was as if he was laughing, crying, and madly yelling at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Then, why do you have to do this?" Luo Zheng couldn't help but shake his head as he pitied the mental state of the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! I don't need your opinion!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>The Life-energy Graver just inflicted a second wound on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>And a third one.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder continued to slash at Luo Zheng using the graver, but the ancestry-level bloodline started to gather more life energy in order to repair Luo Zheng's injuries.</p>

  <p>This cycle continued for over five minutes on the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>The attacks of the graver became more and more ferocious, but at the same time, the rate of regeneration of the ancestry-level bloodline also became faster and faster.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Your body's already extremely sturdy, but it also has such formidable regeneration ability. Let's see how you handle this one though!"</p>
