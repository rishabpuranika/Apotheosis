<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last time Zheng was in Pear Hill, he had taught the Snake Goddess the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were quick to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way, they still needed more time.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had already found the human race on the Other Shore and had been to the Deleting Space again, the Snake Goddess still hadn't completely mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, so she naturally didn't have the chance to meet King Manard.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, King Manard, namely Ziya Jiang, used to be a master at the Eternal Realm. Moreover, he had stayed in the Deleting Space for over a thousand chaotic eras, so he was strong surely.</p>

  <p>If he could descend, then he would undoubtedly become the strongest warrior in the Source World!</p>

  <p>"Yes… King Manard can descend…" the Snake Goddess murmured.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes lit up upon hearing her words. "Is it that master who's trapped in the Deleting Space?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was known to be jealous of anyone who was stronger than him, but he was still an upright and kind-hearted man. He was definitely on the side of the human race.</p>

  <p>"We can try to let Ziya descend. I wonder if the Descending Ring is suitable for the Deleting Space..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and walked straight towards Fuxi. He stretched out his hand and said, "We'll know if it works or not after we try."</p>

  <p>With a flick of Fuxi's finger, a Descending Ring floated in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under the crowd's watchful eyes, Zheng sat cross-legged and put the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit into the ring. Then, he began to recite the Truth of Three-Energy Construction and soon returned to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>These days, Ziya had been accompanying Geoffrey to explore the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He had been shocked at Geoffrey's performance when the latter had entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time. After that, Geoffrey continued to surprise him as they continued to explore the world together.</p>

  <p>When Ziya had previously explored the mountain on his own, he felt like a blind man who entered a forest. Every step he took had been so difficult.</p>

  <p>He could only rely on his superior memory and analysis to make up for what he lacked.</p>

  <p>His exploration was extremely time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, he didn't get to cross the mountain though so many years had passed, let alone cross that river.</p>

  <p>However, Geoffrey changed everything.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, Geoffrey's perception was completely different from Ziya's. It was like his eyes were born to distinguish the paths of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He had thoroughly understood the whole mountain's situation in only a few days. He had solved all of Ziya's puzzles within a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Ziya's only regret was that Geoffrey was right when he said that the mountain didn't have any resources and he wasn't interested in it.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to cross the river next. As Geoffrey led him, Ziya crossed the river and began to explore further.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, he was still half unaware of everything about the Abstruse Energy World, and Geoffrey had to lead him almost all the way.</p>

  <p>After several explorations, they finally got something new. Ziya's understanding and guess of the Abstruse Energy World increased with each passing day. During the explorations, he had some contradicting thoughts.</p>

  <p id="top_24">He wanted to get in touch with the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World, and more importantly, he wanted to know about the civilization of this world.</p>

  <p>Yet, the Abstruse Energy World wasn't as safe as it looked. Many times during their explorations, it was Geoffrey who found the dangers ahead of time and rushed with him, which allowed him to escape back to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Even though the Abstruse Energy World was dangerous, it was still fascinating. Ziya even treated Geoffrey like a rare treasure.</p>

  <p>He tried his best to meet any requests Geoffrey made, as long as they were within his abilities.</p>

  <p>When Zheng returned to the Deleting Space, he saw that another magnificent and exquisite palace had been built on the other side of the Deleting Pillars.</p>

  <p>Of course, the palace was for Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Even if Ziya was omnipotent in this space, it still took him a lot of effort to build such a palace out of thin air with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Zheng waited in front of the palace for a while. Then, Ziya appeared in front of him through the space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>Back then, Ziya had always acted like he was a transcendent being whenever he was in front of Zheng. This time, however, he was completely different. He jovially smiled as if he was good friends with Zheng.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng was confused, but he respectfully asked, "Master Ziya, where is Geoffrey?"</p>

  <p>"He is still in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He has been staying there for the past few days," replied Ziya. "Will he be in danger as he is alone?" Zheng asked again worriedly.</p>

  <p>He would be lying if he said he wasn't worried about Geoffrey when he handed him over to Ziya.</p>

  <p>Ziya patted his head and said, "We've encountered several dangers recently, but that kid escaped the Abstruse Energy World at such an amazing speed every time. He should be fine."</p>

  <p>The space in the Abstruse Energy World existed in a very special form, so Ziya couldn't understand the way Geoffrey moved.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw that Ziya was sure of his words, he felt slightly reassured.</p>

  <p>After all, Ziya had been in the Abstruse Energy World for so many years.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Geoffrey was like a fish in the water when he was in the Abstruse Energy World, so it meant that he could protect himself.</p>

  <p>"This time, I didn't come to see Geoffrey," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Naturally, Ziya was confused. He thought that Zheng was eager to come back because he was worried about his son.</p>

  <p>"I want to invite you to descend to the Source World," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ziya's eyes widened to the size of saucers. "Descend? That's too dangerous!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>In reality, his control over the space could allow him to go to the chaos on his own.</p>

  <p>But something happened to him before. Many chaotic eras ago, he had tried to throw the things which were created in his inner world into the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, the second he did so, the things he threw triggered the truth and eventually disappeared. He had given up doing that since then.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng noticed Ziya's hesitation, he told him about the descent of the Augury Dog and took out the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>When Ziya was still unsure, the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared again.</p>

  <p>He smiled and said, "You have always been cautious, and cautiousness ensures safety. After all, the Deleting Space is still a bit different from the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Ziya stretched out his hand and brought out a dark cyan toad from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Supreme Dragon Hall, everyone silently waited for the master who was to descend from the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>As Zheng opened his eyes, a cyan toad appeared under the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expressions became more unreadable at that moment, and the entire hall became even quieter. Since they had met the Augury Dog, which descended from Stage Thirty-three once, many of them thought that the toad was that master they were waiting for.</p>

  <p>A violent wave came from the sky, but the toad avoided the punishment of the truth. Once Zheng had confirmed that it was safe, he returned to the Deleting Space. A few seconds later, Ziya finally appeared in the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>
