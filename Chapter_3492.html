<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's face was expressionless. He stretched out his hand. The ring that was floating in the air, some distance away, flew towards him. He closed his fingers around the ring as it came to rest on his palm. He shook his head and recited the Truth of Godly Way in order to return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As soon as he arrived, he was greeted with a series of urgent questions.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"How is the Moon Fire Slave?"</p>

  <p>"Did he make it?" asked the nine light orbs on the thrones. They were eager to get some answers from Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slave's survival was the most important thing to them.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer sighed. "No. He failed. He was killed by the truth," he said.</p>

  <p>The light orbs were aghast. "How could this be?"</p>

  <p>"But he succeeded in getting there in the first place!"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't supposed to fail!"</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer could sense the fury in the light orbs.</p>

  <p>They had already succeeded before. How could they have failed at the most critical moment?</p>

  <p>"It's not that easy to escape the truth," Divine Farmer explained. "It's true that the Moon Fire Slave managed to enter the chaos, but he was quickly detected and killed by the truth rule."</p>

  <p>"But how about that huge eye? Why did it survive?" asked the light orb on the second chair from the left.</p>

  <p>This question baffled Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while. Slowly he replied, "Maybe it's because that Dreaded Eye Demon was not powerful enough..."</p>

  <p>Although the Moon Fire Slave was only a slave of the Element Spirit Civilization, his strength was at a very high level. Most warriors found his strength to be absolutely terrifying.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the Dreaded Eye Demon was much weaker.</p>

  <p>The light orbs considered Divine Farmer's explanation. "All right, then... let's try using a weak water spirit," said the light orb in the middle.</p>

  <p>A splash sounded as soon as the light orb had spoken.</p>

  <p>A wave of water rolled towards them. It halted abruptly in front of Divine Farmer, gathered itself into a human-shaped blue mass and stood up.</p>

  <p>It was a creature made of water. Its human shape changed further as it added armor over its body.</p>

  <p>Water spirits were at the lowest level of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>This creature's strength would definitely be far inferior to that of the Dreaded Eye Demon.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was still holding the ring in one hand. He stepped closer to the water spirit and gently placed the ring on top of its head. Immediately, Divine Farmer and the water spirit disappeared from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The light orbs waited, saying nothing. In just a few seconds, Divine Farmer reappeared. He wore a disappointed look on his face. "Another failure. We must be missing something. It wasn't just the ring that allowed the Dreaded Eye Demon to successfully enter the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>"What have we missed?" demanded the light orb in the middle. Its tone was harsh.</p>

  <p>"We must find out as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>"We will tolerate no further mistakes!" another light orb chimed in.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer stared around at the light orbs and sighed.</p>

  <p>He returned once more to the chaos. The Thunder Dimorphodon was waiting not far from where he appeared. Divine Farmer went to the creature and said, "I must ask you something. After the death of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, were there any other things in her body besides the rings?"</p>

  <p>"The crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits," replied the Thunder Dimorphodon promptly.</p>

  <p>"Anything else besides the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits?" Divine Farmer inquired urgently.</p>

  <p>If the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits were the only things in the body, then they had no more clues to work with. It would be impossible to figure out how the creatures on the Other Shore could return to the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon considered Divine Farmer's question, thinking deeply. Suddenly it looked up with a gleam in its eye. "Yes!" it exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What? What else?" Divine Farmer asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"There was another kind of crystals in her body. These crystals had similar auras to the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, but they were slightly different. A little thicker. They were golden red crystals," said the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>It was the Thunder Dimorphodon's mission to bring back the Descending Rings. It was completely focused on this task, and did not bother to take any other things into consideration.</p>

  <p>At that time, it had kept its eye on Zheng. It hadn't attacked him until he took away all the golden red crystals.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer thought about what Thunder Dimorphodon said, and then his eyes widened as he realized something. Perhaps those golden red crystals were the key.</p>

  <p>"Who has those golden red crystals now? Does Mount have them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer had been hiding in the chaos cloud, waiting for the Thunder Dimorphodon. What had happened in the Chaotic Source World was none of his business.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was impossible for any peers and disciples to be worthy opponents for Mount among the many races.</p>

  <p>"No," said the Thunder Dimorphodon. "It was a disciple named  Zheng Luo from the Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>It had been paying close attention to the Chaotic Source World, and kept track of important warriors and taken note of everything happening inside.</p>

  <p>"A disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Divine Farmer repeated, feeling stunned. "A mere disciple? How is that possible? Where was Mount?"</p>

  <p>With a helpless smile on its face, the Thunder Dimorphodon replied, "You mean the avatar of Othniel? He was defeated. This time, two people had both made a world descend in the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer still looked incredulous, so the Thunder Dimorphodon explained everything it had seen. Finally, it ended by saying, "The young man named Zheng also has the Soaring Snake Sword."</p>

  <p>A fierce light flashed across Divine Farmer's eyes. He was shocked at the events described by the Thunder Dimorphodon, but there was no way it could be mistaken. He said, "This young man might be Chiyou's descendant. He has all the golden red crystals?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>"Understood," Divine Farmer said.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race had already been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Even if there were still some remaining members hiding somewhere within the Source World, there was nothing to be feared from them.</p>

  <p>However, Divine Farmer never expected that someone from the Nine Li race would appear out of nowhere and obtain the most precious treasure of all.</p>

  <p>"So, the Oneness Sky Palace has a powerful disciple... It looks like something is up in that place," Divine Farmer said to himself. There was a gleam of coldness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had been staying on the jadeite platform for the past few days.</p>

  <p>He stood silently, and flipped his hand. Instantly, complex runes spread out across the surface of the jadeite platform. These runes bore a strong resemblance to the magic arrays of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>A buzzing sound filled the air.</p>

  <p>The golden red crystal rose into the air and floated in a circle around him.</p>

  <p>"Refine!" he said.</p>

  <p>The power of the magic array under his feet was over ten times stronger than that of the magic arrays in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>All the lights dancing along the lines of the magic array gathered on the surface of the golden red crystal.</p>

  <p>As the minutes passed, the lights dimmed, and then vanished.</p>

  <p>Fuxi examined the golden red crystal. It was exactly the same as it had been before refining.</p>

  <p>He was taken aback. "What the hell is this crystal?" he murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>The power of this magic array was immense. Even something a hundred times stronger than a crystal could be melted by this array. However, this golden red crystal had somehow remained intact.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Snake Goddess appeared on the jadeite platform again.</p>

  <p>She saw him holding the golden red crystal and asked, "Have you refined it yet?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi studied the golden red crystal intently. "This crystal is very strange. It doesn't seem very dense or solid. Yet it can withstand the power of this array in the process of refining. It simply refuses to melt."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was intrigued. "Let me try," she requested, holding out her hand. Fuxi gave her the golden red crystal.</p>

  <p>Instead of using the magic array arranged by Fuxi, she directly activated the energy beams of her shadow. Crimson energy beams flowed out, twining around the golden red crystal and burrowing into its surface.</p>

  <p>Fuxi watched closely.</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess had an astonishing energy. There was probably nothing in the Source World that could resist the direct impact of her energy beams.</p>

  <p>As before, the golden red crystal was entirely enveloped for several minutes in the glowing red light. But as the light dimmed, the golden red crystal was revealed to be intact and unchanged in the palm of the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>She raised an eyebrow, looking astonished. "This crystal seems to be immune to being melted by energy, no matter how powerful. What's going on?"</p>
