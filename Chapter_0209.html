<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Demon King Aldrich became furious, "How dare you insult a demon king like me? Do you know the consequences of your action?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not interested in finding out. I only know that the human and demon are enemies, so don't try to lure me into surrendering," Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>"I like you, unfortunately, you'll have to die. I hope you won't regret the choice you made." Demon King Aldrich heightened the speed and frequency of releasing the evil spirit.</p>

  <p>Demon King Aldrich's strength intensified and the pressure in Yolande's shoulder became heavier. At that moment, her beautiful little face turned pale and she was struggling to hang on.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Yolande and saw that she kept that blank face even at a time like this. It made her look more pathetic in trying to look calm and composed.</p>

  <p>Even though he didn't like Yolande, he was moved by her determination.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no harm in trying again."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also knew that he had no choice but to fight Demon King Aldrich. If Yolande lost in the battle, he would end in a more miserable situation than the people in the White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>'This battle has to end now!' Luo Zheng made up his mind and jumped from where he was towards Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>He was close enough to Demon King Aldrich that he could reach the latter in one jump.</p>

  <p>Seeing what Luo Zheng was doing, Yolande took this opportunity to release more life vitality from her body. With Demon King Aldrich distracted, she could now take him down for good.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what Luo Zheng would do as long as he could distract Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>As he approached the demon king, Luo Zheng shot a pale-yellow sharp thorn from his forehead and darted at Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual Thorn!"</p>

  <p>He didn't expect to do much damage to the demon king. His only goal was to distract him.</p>

  <p>But he was surprised to see that his Spiritual Thorn stabbed Demon King Aldrich's head.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Way to go!" Luo Zheng shouted with joy.</p>

  <p>The pale-yellow Spiritual Thorn did pierce Demon King Aldrich's head.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, the demon king had no reaction at all.</p>

  <p>Demon King Aldrich laughed hysterically. "I'm impressed! I didn't know you could launch spiritual attacks. But it doesn't really matter. You may be stronger than any normal human beings, but you're still no match for me. Only if your soul was a lot stronger, you could've already killed me,"</p>

  <p>Demon King Aldrich said. "But since you failed, let me kill you instead."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly felt an invisible force rolling towards him.</p>

  <p>All the while he thought that the invisible force could defend Demon King Aldrich from any outside attacks like his flying knife and Heavenly Ogre Fist. But he was surprised to find out that it could also be used to attack.</p>

  <p>'What a tremendous force!'</p>

  <p>He didn't have time to dodge it, so he just faced the incoming attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With the power of the invisible force, Luo Zheng was thrown out.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>He hit the bottom of the light screen and bounced back repeatedly like a rubber ball.</p>

  <p>After bouncing back for several times, the force of motion gradually decreased. Luo Zheng landed at the bottom of the light screen and fell unconscious.</p>

  <p>"What now, kid? Tired already?" Demon King Aldrich laughed hysterically. "You're a brave ant to think you can bite a big demon king like me." Demon King Aldrich laughed again scornfully.</p>

  <p>Yolande's eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng with her face still calm and unconcerned, but her eyes were wide and blinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm masters saw everything, and they shook their heads in disappointment. It was ridiculous to hope for Luo Zheng to defeat any demon king. After all, even for the masters like themselves found it difficult to defeat a demon king especially Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Zheng could survive that massive force of an attack. All of them thought he was dead.</p>

  <p>But lo and behold, Luo Zheng started to move. He raised his head first and got up.</p>

  <p>He was standing as if nothing happened to him. He stretched his body and felt that that blow almost broke his waist.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was because of that tremendous power that Zheng's body was now producing warm currents. The warm currents flowed into the center of his body and made him feel more comfortable.</p>

  <p>He was willing to take more blows only if they couldn't kill him. It was his way of practicing to reach the nature level.</p>

  <p>Seeing how easy Luo Zheng recovered from his attack, Demon King Aldrich trembled in fury.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, not from afar, Yolande's blank face changed. A sly smile crossed her face and her eyes were glowing with excitement.</p>

  <p>The chance of seeing a blue moon was higher than the chance of Yolande ever smiling. If one saw Yolande smiling, they would even think it was a coincidence and not because she was happy.</p>

  <p>Luckily, everyone was paying attention to Luo Zheng. No one saw the change in Yolande's expression, not even Luo Zheng who was busy planning on how to return the favor to Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>While Yolande and Demon King Aldrich continued to face each other, Luo Zheng was anxious in coming up with a plan. As he walked back and forth, he caught sight of Hugh in a distance and an idea instantly came to his mind.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands in the air to attract Hugh's attention. Amongst the Illuminating Soul Realm masters, Hugh was the only one defeated by Luo Zheng in a battle. But despite that, it didn't mean that he wasn't good enough to be one of the masters. All that had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm were either the privileged or the most gifted.</p>

  <p>Hugh soon understood what Luo Zheng was trying to signal to him.</p>

  <p>In their last battle, Luo Zheng was able to absorb Hugh's five-clawed Golden Dragon and turned it into the Black Dragon with his demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>This could mean that Luo Zheng could absorb other people's life vitality and used it as his own.</p>

  <p>Hugh knew exactly what Luo Zheng was planning. Without second thoughts, he stretched out his arms, released his five-clawed Golden Dragon, and sent it to Luo Zheng.</p>
