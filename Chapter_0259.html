<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fren wondered, 'What strange cultivation method has he been practicing?'</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was not the time for Fren to think about that. Because he wanted to kill Luo Zheng as soon as possible, he did not have any more time to waste. Though he had lost a sword, there were still six left in his control.</p>

  <p>And so, while Fren waved his hand again, the invisible swordsmen raised his six swords. On his command, they were ready to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, some black and purple spots appeared on his six remaining weapons. Fren could only watch in horror as the spots scattered all over the swords.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Fren exclaimed.</p>

  <p>With his eyes wide open, Fren noticed that the remaining six swords had lost contact with him. What just happened was beyond absurd!</p>

  <p>In a state of helplessness, he watched the colors of his six swords change from orange to purple-black.</p>

  <p>"I said you are no longer qualified to take my life. With your current strength, you should run whenever you see me.</p>

  <p>It's a pity you were not smart to believe my words," said Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>After the transformation of the demonic life energy into demonic life vitality, its ability to absorb and transform other energies became more frightening while the speed had greatly improved.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng used the purple-black sword to prevent the attacks of Fren's other six, the opportunity for their blades to clash arose.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when the demonic life vitality of the purple-black sword transferred into the other six swords along the gaps of the blades.</p>

  <p>Although infiltrated by only a small amount of the demonic life vitality, it was enough for the rest of Zheng's strategy to work.</p>

  <p>The demonic life vitality continuously altered Fren's life vitality at high speed. As a result, it was inevitable for Luo Zheng to seize command of the six swords eventually.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng raised his arms, seven purple-black swords in mid-air spiraled around him.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Vivan had not given up her attack. Once again, she threw ten willow leaf darts at Luo Zheng. However, he glanced at the woman who was hot, in both temperament and her body figure, with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>One of the swords brushed in front of Luo Zheng and slightly knocked down those willow leaf darts. After deflecting every incoming attack, the sword rejoined the rank as though nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's control, the seven swords aimed upward, whirling faster and faster, and getting closer to each other until finally, they united and compressed into a huge sword.</p>

  <p>"Oh God!" exclaimed Fren, astonished.</p>

  <p>"This is... This is the Heavenly Sword!</p>

  <p>How did you know how to use our Zhuge Clan's Seven Mysterious Demon Swords?" Even with his own eyes, it was hard to believe what was happening.</p>

  <p>The last and strongest move of the Zhuge Clan's Seven Mysterious Demon Swords was the unification of the seven swords known as the Heavenly Sword, a technique that was extremely difficult to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Only someone who reached the state of the Illuminating Soul Realm could achieve such a remarkable feat.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even Fren himself could not utilize this skill at the moment.</p>

  <p>Only some elders of the Zhuge Clan who were at Illuminating Soul Realm could achieve the Heavenly Sword.</p>

  <p>It was astonishing that Luo Zheng had not only seized all of the seven swords, but he also succeeded in condensing them into the Heavenly Sword.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was no wonder that Fren was so stunned.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, Luo Zheng did not actually know how to use the Zhuge Clan's cultivation method of the Seven Mysterious Demon Swords. All he had achieved was merging the seven swords into a big one by utilizing the characteristics of the demonic life vitality. What a Heavenly Sword was, or how to activate one, was beyond his knowledge.</p>

  <p>A genuine Heavenly Sword contained a trace of Heavenly Intent.</p>

  <p>At his present cultivation level, the Heavenly Intent was not something Luo Zheng could master.</p>

  <p>However, although the enormous sword in front of Luo Zheng did not contain Heavenly Intent, it still gave people a strong sense of deterrence.</p>

  <p>It was this sense of deterrence that frightened Fren, as he thought that Luo Zheng could use the Heavenly Sword.</p>

  <p>As he had witnessed the strong power of the Heavenly Intent emitting from the sword when family elders wielded it, Fren knew the Heavenly Sword's vast capabilities.</p>

  <p>Frightened by the huge sword, Fren ran away for his life at once. In his haste to take cover, there was no time for him to distinguish whether the power that emanated from the sword was the real Heavenly Intent or not.</p>

  <p>As he was so convinced by its authenticity, he did not even think to doubt it at all.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you want to escape now?</p>

  <p>It is too late."</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng waved his hand, the huge sword, which was about ten feet long and several feet wide, directly shot towards Fren.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! Stop it. If you kill him, you will die!" shouted Murry quickly.</p>

  <p>He never imagined Luo Zheng would dare to kill Fren. 'Does this fellow really know no fear?</p>

  <p>If he kills Fren in Cloud Sect, who else could protect him?' thought Murry.</p>

  <p>"Don't run, Fren. I'll kill him!" stated Vivan fiercely.</p>

  <p>Soaked in an unknown evil spirit, Vivan's eyes turned blood red and her pale skin bloomed with red spots. Even the willow leaf darts she thrust were contaminated with blood. After noticing these details, Luo Zheng deemed that she must have been using some mysterious cultivation method.</p>

  <p>"Are you still not giving up?" asked Luo Zheng, looking at the woman incredulously.</p>

  <p>The huge sword not only blocked the willow leaf darts, but also absorbed the blood energy of the darts.</p>

  <p>With its huge side panel like a door, the huge sword flew over and touched Vivan's enchanting body that had made many men think about it day and night.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Knocked by the sword, Vivan flew against the wall with a muffled noise.</p>

  <p>Then slowly, she collapsed and lowered her head while losing consciousness.</p>
