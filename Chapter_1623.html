  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before long, Luo Zheng had reached the mountainside but his gaze was transfixed on something just beyond.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had met Xun's long sword at this very spot and yet it was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ventured forward another few hundred feet. Back then, Luo Zheng had thrown his sword away but no matter where he looked, he could not see any sign of it.</p>

  <p>"It makes sense. This is an illusion made by the soul mark of a True God, not the true Killing Sword Mountain. This illusion may be the Killing Sword Mountain from 100, 000 years, or a million, possibly even tens of millions years ago. It looks like it will be impossible to ever retrieve my sword again."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, those swords came raining down towards him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached the middle of the mountain, the long swords that were attacking him were fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng masterfully swung the mysterious weapon, deflecting each of the swords as he advanced.</p>

  <p>He continued up the mountain, eager to see who that person was.</p>

  <p>Weapons continued to fall on him - fairy weapons, sacred weapons, divine weapons; rank above rank.</p>

  <p>The higher up the mountain he went, the higher the rank of the swords on the mountain was.</p>

  <p>Each sword was getting sharper and sharper, attacking him in different way.</p>

  <p>There were many different swordsmanship styles.</p>

  <p>'The Emotion Closing Godly Way... Strictly speaking, it is also a type of swordsmanship. I wonder, if I train in other swordsmanship, will I be able to enter the Godly Way?'</p>

  <p>The question lingered in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Just as the other True Gods he had encountered before, the Godly Ways they stepped into were also varied. But could that mean that there was not any specific cultivation method for cultivating the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>As long as there was some way that one could cultivate a technique to the peak beyond the restraints of the heavens, would one be able to create a new Godly Way?</p>

  <p>Could there be many ways considered Godly?</p>

  <p>And yet why would the Emotion Closing Godly Way be known as a forbidden way?</p>

  <p>As the thoughts ticked away in his mind, Luo Zheng continued up to the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>At the summit, a middle-aged man with a long, wispy beard sat upright, a short sword floating gently beside him.</p>

  <p>The short sword was two and a half feet long and white in color. The blade was simple and unadorned but undeniably sharp. It seemed unassuming.</p>

  <p>"The Gods-intimidating Sword!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose slightly at the sight.</p>

  <p>He had long guessed that the person at the peak of the mountain would be Supreme Lord Sword. But now seeing the Gods-intimidating Sword which Yolande had mentioned before, Luo Zheng had been sure this person was Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>However, since Supreme Lord Sword had appeared in the Corridor of Emperor, perhaps the more fitting name for him was True God Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Sword suddenly rang out and circled in the air, shooting towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was prepared.</p>

  <p>This was not his first encounter with the white sword, for he had faced against it while at the giant rock in the Orange Sea World.</p>

  <p>As the sword flew towards him, Luo Zheng did not hesitate at all. He quickly moved the mysterious weapon in his hand, blocking it but the Gods-intimidating Sword did not budge.</p>

  <p>But the mysterious weapon was not strong enough to block the Gods-intimidating Sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword was instantly shattered, falling to the ground in pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained composed, lifting his hand to conjure another long sword in its place.</p>

  <p>This was the first rank divine weapon that he had just captured.</p>

  <p>Warriors would rarely find a supreme divine weapon on the Killing Sword Mountain. Warriors who already had their divine weapons rarely passed through this mountain to gain insights so it was unlikely to find their weapons here.</p>

  <p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng brandished his new sword against the Gods-intimidating Sword.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had summited the mountain, Supreme Lord Sword had not opened his eyes, disinterested with the goings on.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Luo Zheng had no interest in the Supreme Lords he encountered before, but he was extremely interested in this Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Sword continued to fly at Luo Zheng, protecting its master intuitively. Whenever Luo Zheng tried to make it higher up the mountain, he was forced back by the Gods-intimidating Sword.</p>

  <p>Each movement from the Gods-intimidating Sword was calculated but unpredictable. The trajectory of the Gods-intimidating Sword was extremely agile. Even though Luo Zheng used the No Move, he could only block every move the Gods-intimidating Sword made as Supreme Lord Sword sat silently, his eyes closed shut.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng frowned. After he concentrated for a second, a sword intent that jumping continuously suddenly shot out!</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng usually only used this move in times of crisis.</p>

  <p>Even when he was fighting against Lucille, he did not use it. Yet, when against these True Gods, Luo Zheng did not hold back and used every move with all his power to fight back.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>The blades connected, the sheer power finally knocking away the Gods-intimidating Sword.</p>

  <p>Finally, Supreme Lord Sword opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>He could not hide the astonishment in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled his hands together in a deep bow to Supreme Lord Sword. He carefully stepped forward.</p>

  <p>Before he could open his mouth to speak, Supreme Lord Sword jumped in, "What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"My name is  Luo Zheng Luo, sir," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"You know me?" Supreme Lord Sword asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are Supreme Lord Sword," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword's eyes scanned over Luo Zheng from top to bottom. "My name is Sword Chen. I created the Emotion Closing Godly Way."</p>

  <p>So "Supreme Lord" was just a title and Sword Chen was his real name.</p>

  <p>Becoming True God, it was now no longer appropriate for Luo Zheng to call him a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"It seems you have followed my way of swordsmanship here." Supreme Lord Sword's eyes were now glued to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>A whisper of a smile crawled onto Supreme Lord Sword's mouth. He remained seated at the summit of the mountain. He slowly reached out his hand and the Gods-intimidating Sword came flying back. Then, he pointed his sword at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A cyan light came shining out of the sword.</p>

  <p>This cyan light was also the sword intent.</p>

  <p>However, this sword intent was a thousand times purer than the sword intent that Luo Zheng had comprehended before!</p>

  <p>This was the ultimate sword intent!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not intimidated.</p>

  <p>He knew that Supreme Lord Sword did not intend to kill him so he knew that this was just a test. Without hesitation, he thrust out his sword as well.</p>

  <p>The two of them moved as though they were mirrors. But Zheng's incompetence to Supreme Lord Sword still showed.</p>

  <p>The two swords never collided.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword jabbed him, the sword going through halfway before he retracted, only to jab once more.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hesitate either. When Supreme Lord Sword retracted his sword, Luo Zheng did the same. When Supreme Lord Sword stabbed out, Luo Zheng did the same again.</p>

  <p>These two people clashed in midair, but no one won the fight.</p>

  <p>One sword strike…</p>

  <p>Ten sword strikes…</p>

  <p>Hundred sword strikes...</p>

  <p>Thousand sword strikes...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand sword strikes...</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand strikes...</p>

  <p>Time meant nothing to them at this moment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know what fatigue was, and Supreme Lord Sword was also quite patient.</p>

  <p>This was a test, a tempering, and a silent teaching!</p>

  <p>After a million sword strikes, Supreme Lord Sword suddenly stopped as he looked indifferently at Luo Zheng, saying, "If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I would never believe that someone would be able to see through the poem I left behind…"</p>

  <p>"I knew that was a coincidence," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"No," Supreme Lord Sword smiled slightly. "Not exactly. The fortune before you is not set in stone. It seems there is someone pushing you in a different direction."</p>

  <p>Confusion befell Zheng's face. He did not understand what he was hearing.</p>

  <p>"Someone pushing me?"</p>

  <p>"Who he is, I do not know. And I do not know his intentions but I am sure that he is making the arrangements for you," Supreme Lord Sword continued.</p>

  <p id="top_8"><a id="p8840" class="calibre2"></a>Zheng's brows creased. He did not understand what Supreme Lord Sword was talking about and the mystery made him feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was no fatalist. Even if he came to a situation that seemed inevitable, he always seemed to find a way to exert his will. His fate always remained in his own hands, even if for a little bit.</p>

  <p>But the words of Supreme Lord Sword undermined all of this. Was there really someone who was planning out his fate?</p>

  <p>Seeing the confusion on Zheng's face, Supreme Lord Sword smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"This is not a problem you and I have to discuss. I am not particularly concerned about this." As though he was closing the chapter on what he just revealed, he switched topics. "How many lotus petals has your Lotus Flower bloomed?" Supreme Lord Sword asked.</p>

  <p>"Nine petals of the Hinayana Lotus Flower and twenty-six petals of the Mahayana Lotus Flower," Luo Zheng offered up easily.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword nodded his head, as though in approval of Zheng's answer. "Not bad. With the 35 petals at the Soul Sea Realm, it will not be long before you become a Godly Genius. Not bad, not bad at all."</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng had indeed succeeded in the Emotion Closing Godly Way and with only one lotus petal remaining closed, Zheng's Lotus Flower would soon be in full bloom.</p>
