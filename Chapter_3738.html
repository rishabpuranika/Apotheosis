<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3738 To The Blooming Jade Stage </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The raven-haired boy's face remained dull and stiff for over an hour.</p>

  <p>During this time, the fluctuation within the Source World quietly disappeared.</p>

  <p>When the boy came back to his senses, he jumped off the stone? his instinct was to run away.</p>

  <p>But too many powerful warriors were currently in the underground hall? any one of them could easily subdue him.</p>

  <p>Before he could even take another step forward, he was trapped in an invisible cage.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan walked briskly toward the raven-haired boy.</p>

  <p>He figured that the boy would quickly get all memories of Usman, but he was surprised to find otherwise.</p>

  <p>While the boy reacted to the mention of Usman, he didn't remember much about him.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan felt a tremor between his brows before he could say something.</p>

  <p>His face seemed to shift in color before he turned to the woman in white fox-fur robe.</p>

  <p>"Take him back?"</p>

  <p>The latter merely nodded and dragged the boy away.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, Xuanyuan disappeared from everyone's view, entering a dark room.</p>

  <p>His forehead began to crack, from which an eyeball emerged. "Kill him!" a voice resounded from the eyeball. "Kill that brat!"</p>

  <p>Its voice was full of fury.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had a deep foundation. Even Xuanyuan couldn't tell how powerful the second civilization was.</p>

  <p>In the face of everything in the Source World, the Element Spirit Civilization always seemed to remain calm.</p>

  <p>But this time, it looked rather exasperated. "Kill whom?" asked Xuanyuan. "Luo Zheng!" the eyeball nearly yelled back.</p>

  <p>Even Emperor Di Jun had died because of Luo Zheng, so Xuanyuan had figured he should pay attention to the man. Besides, the Descending Rings they had obtained couldn't be used successfully. He highly suspected that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Luo Zheng's hand had something to do with it.</p>

  <p>"Why the hurry?" asked Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>"He has passed through the Soul City," the eyeball said.</p>

  <p>"The Soul City? He's quite fast?" said Xuanyuan plainly.</p>

  <p>"He passed through the Soul City in a single try and obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>At that, Xuanyuan couldn't hide his shock.</p>

  <p>The very idea of passing through the Soul City in a single try was truly astonishing.</p>

  <p>What was even more bizarre was the fact that Luo Zheng could obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints? something that had never before happened on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In fact, the news that Luo Zheng had obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints already spread through the Souls of Light in the Soul City.</p>

  <p>But the internal structure of the Bearing race was complicated. It took some time for the news to spread layer by layer, delaying the dissemination. As a result, Xuanyuan had yet to find out about what had happened to Dailey.</p>

  <p>"Since he's already passed through the Soul City, I'm afraid he'll want to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation. We'd better snip him in the bud in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore," calculated Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have a good understanding of Luo Zheng even without having met him personally.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed to be the only special existence that entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He had his very own corporeal body.</p>

  <p>When Xuanyuan heard of the fact for the first time, he thought of the Eternal Scroll Painting? something Luo Zheng could possibly enter.</p>

  <p>But at that time, Luo Zheng had just become famous in Stage Four of the Other Shore. There was a long way to go before he reached Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, so it wasn't the time to give it much mind.</p>

  <p>In truth, he had even doubted that it was likely Luo Zheng could reach Stage Thirty-two alive.</p>

  <p>But after only such a short time, Luo Zheng had already passed through the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"Of course we will," continued the eyeball. "But for security's sake, you must take action in the Source World as well. You also need the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, after all!"</p>

  <p>'Must I personally lead the Bearing race?'</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan wondered, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>Though Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying couldn't come back now, the Li Shan mountain wouldn't let them do anything easily. The fact made Xuanyuan feel the need to set up certain strategies.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore? the Soul City had been open for one hundred and thirty-two hours, and it was time to close it.</p>

  <p>Before the gate was shut, the Souls of Light in the Soul City emerged one after another.</p>

  <p>From afar, Luo Zheng saw Feng Ge step out wearing a grim expression. He, on the other hand, walked up to her with a smile and asked, "How is it going this time?"</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred and ten feet," Feng Ge answered with her head bowed. "I've tried my best, but I'm still too slow?"</p>

  <p>"You're already very quick? you obviously already surpass Li Bianxue's talent in this aspect," Luo Zheng assured her.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge merely pouted.</p>

  <p>She didn't want the Soul City to become a restrictive barrier. She was very eager to pass through it.</p>

  <p>This time, Feng Ge had pushed herself to the limit. To a certain extent, even Li Bianxue, the top disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, couldn't catch up with her.</p>

  <p>But so what?</p>

  <p>A great gap still remained between her and Luo Zheng. It was impossible for Luo Zheng to wait for her the entire time.</p>

  <p>"The test in the Soul City is a form of training, so you shouldn't be anxious.</p>

  <p>I'll wait for you in the Land of Bone Tribulation," Luo Zheng assured her.</p>

  <p>Urgent was the current situation, so Luo Zheng had to press forward.</p>

  <p>A Soul of Light nearby quickly walked over to them, carrying an aura that seemed far stronger than the ordinary. It was none other than Li Bianxue, who had already passed the test of the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Li Bianxue!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect you to pass the test so soon!"</p>

  <p>Both Zhu Ge Feng and Carver were still around Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>Without Luo Zheng's incomprehensible record, Li Bianxue's performance was amazing in itself.</p>

  <p>But over the past few days, all attention had been given to Luo Zheng, both inside and outside the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Even Li Bianxue could feel that passing the test of the Soul City was a common thing? there was nothing to be excited about.</p>

  <p>Once she arrived at Luo Zheng's side, she immediately said, "I've also passed the test of the Soul City. I want to go to Stage Thirty of the Other Shore and I heard that you know some kind of way to release the blood mist and dodge the Garudas. Can I go there with you?"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue hadn't had much interaction with Luo Zheng. When they first met, she had even provoked him. Now she felt rather bad having to ask him for help.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just smiled faintly and said, "We're both disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, so we should help each other out on the Other Shore. If you need to go to a higher stage, I will help you, of course."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's answer had Li Bianxue overjoyed with gratitude. "Thank you, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>It was quite normal for disciples in the Land of Sword Grief to communicate with each other with open arms, but for Feng Ge, it was especially hard to accept. She secretly made up her mind about passing through the test of the Soul City as soon as she possibly could.</p>

  <p>The Soul City was located at the very center of the Constant Glory Stage.</p>

  <p>Behind it lay a long and narrow plank road.</p>

  <p>At the end of it was a huge, round platform where densely distributed star rings led to the Blooming Jade Stage, Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Once he said goodbye to Feng Ge, Luo Zheng used the Blood Fog Spell to cover both himself and Li Bianxue as they moved along the plank road. The moment they arrived at the huge round platform on the opposite end, Luo Zheng saw a Soul of Light of the Holy Soul Realm waiting for him.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light carried two wings on her back? she was a member of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"Phoenix?" Luo Zheng asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>While he couldn't quite see her face clearly, he was already well familiar with her aura after fighting against her several times.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's presence had Li Bianxue rather nervous until she remembered that the Jin Wu no longer existed. The remaining members were dependent on Luo Zheng, so Li Bianxue could feel at ease.</p>
