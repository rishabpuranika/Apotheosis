<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The space inside the cage was very limited. It was barely enough just for a person to sit with his legs crossed.</p>

  <p>Inside the cage, Geoffrey tightly grabbed the fence with both hands and looked intently at his surroundings. At this point, his mind was in a mess.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was going to happen to him.</p>

  <p>From what he could see, he assumed that there were probably thousands of creatures being held in the underground space. The creatures came in different forms and sizes, and they were also speaking in various undecipherable languages.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure but it seems like these creatures only possess little intelligence," Geoffrey murmured to himself as he observed the creatures around him. "What the hell is this place? Why did they catch me?"</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey was indeed smart, he was far from being as determined as his father. He could be ambitious and confident at times, but once he encountered even minor setbacks, he would easily become frustrated.</p>

  <p>"Coo! Coo!"</p>

  <p>Diagonally opposite to Geoffrey's position, a white bird was constantly letting out loud cries while furiously flapping his wings. He had been doing this for more than an hour now.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up! It's so annoying!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shouted in extreme irritation as he punched the fence of the cage.</p>

  <p>As the bird sensed Geoffrey's hostility, he stopped screaming for a few seconds. Then, suddenly, his eyes flashed with an ominous green light.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey incidentally met his eyes, he instantly felt a crushing pain in his head as if he were hit by a heavy hammer. He felt like his skull was being split open that it almost made him faint.</p>

  <p>"Coo! Coo! Coo!"</p>

  <p>Then, the white bird started violently flapping his wings again. His cry was even louder than before.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey sat down for a long time, holding his aching head. After a while, the pain gradually subsided. He sat properly and helplessly said, "These creatures are so aggressive. They may be a bit intelligent, but they still look like a bunch of idiots."</p>

  <p>Just now, the questions that appeared in the mirror were very simple.</p>

  <p>Maybe they took the cultural barriers of different races into consideration and only arranged a simple test. Even though they passed the test, Geoffrey realized that these creatures possessed inferior intelligence than humans.</p>

  <p>Wallowing in despair, Geoffrey's eyes wandered into the cage in front of him, where the little monster he had seen before was being held.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the white bird, this little monster didn't make a ruckus.</p>

  <p>Instead, he climbed onto the railing and stared intently at Geoffrey with his black eyes. He wore a strange and creepy smile on his face as if he had taken an interest in Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell does he keep on staring at me?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey turned around as he complained. He covered his head with both his hands and tried to close his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although he no longer needed any sleep after cultivating to his current level, he felt the need to isolate himself from his surroundings. He didn't want to see or hear them.</p>

  <p>As the night passed, the noise produced by the monsters didn't cease even for a minute.</p>

  <p>When the door of the underground space opened again, they immediately heard rustling sounds coming from beyond the door.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey immediately stood up, pressed his head against the fence and saw that numerous spiders were coming in one after another.</p>

  <p>Then, one of the spiders stopped in front of Geoffrey's cage. He noticed that at the back of the spider, it was carrying a pile of wooden blocks and three square wooden frames.</p>

  <p>"What is it this time? A seven-piece puzzle?"</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey was still in the Cloud Hall, he used to play the seven-piece puzzle. Yudie had hired someone to specifically make and customize the blocks.</p>

  <p>After taking a quick glance, Geoffrey reached out his hand and picked out a few blocks to combine them together. In just a second, he was able to use all the seven blocks to fill the first square wooden frame.</p>

  <p>'Come on, this is so easy!' he thought.</p>

  <p>Then, he used twelve more blocks to fill the bigger square wooden frame, and sixteen more blocks to fill the biggest one.</p>

  <p>'Well, compared to the earlier one, this one is a little more difficult. This test might need the level of intelligence that an ordinary eight-year-old human possesses.' As Geoffrey quickly finished, his gaze fell on the white bird that was about to take the test.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he had no doubt that this creature possessed great strength.</p>

  <p>Just his malevolent stare was able to give Geoffrey a severe headache.</p>

  <p>However, with this test, his intelligence would definitely be tried.</p>

  <p>The white bird stretched his head out of the fence and began picking up blocks to put into the wooden frame. However, no matter how much he tried, he wasn't able to piece the blocks together.</p>

  <p>The blocks were either one piece more or less. The white bird couldn't even finish the smallest frame. Thus there was no way that he could accomplish the bigger ones.</p>

  <p>He seemed to know what might happen to him once he failed to solve the puzzle. The speed at which he picked and rearranged the blocks became faster and faster. At the same time, Geoffrey saw that the anxiety was growing in his eyes. The white bird was getting impatient and frustrated as he couldn't solve the puzzle no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"Coo! Coo! Coo!" The white bird stretched out his neck and started screaming in agitation.</p>

  <p>With a sneer on his face, Geoffrey said, "Ha, you deserve it. Let's see if you could dare to glare at me again."</p>

  <p>This time, the captives were given about an hour to finish the test. As the time was up, the spiders carried unfinished frames away and left the underground space immediately after.</p>

  <p>The underground space that was in an uproar just a few minutes ago suddenly became quiet. As the test ended, most of the monsters knew what was waiting for them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without any warning, a muffled sound rang out in one of the cages, followed by a flash of golden light. In the blink of an eye, the monster in that cage was burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a wave of golden lights shone one after another. The muffled shrieks of the monsters were heard throughout the place. In a few moments, several monsters were burned to death inside their cages.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the white bird clearly knew what was going to happen to him. He struggled madly in the cage, desperately trying to escape from it.</p>

  <p>His wings suddenly turned into a bright and rigid weapon that constantly slashed the fence. However, the fence was made from an exceptional solid material. Even with the white bird's extraordinary strength, his wings didn't even leave a dent or scratch on it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the golden light flashed in the white bird's cage, he was instantly charred, and only a few of his white feathers remained floating out of his cage.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the miserable death of the white bird, Geoffrey wasn't satisfied at all. Instead, he also panicked because he didn't know for sure that he was already safe.</p>

  <p>Even if he had finished all those puzzles, if the spiders had somehow made a mistake in checking their records, then he was still doomed. He could imagine the unjust death that he would receive.</p>

  <p>However, after a few moments, all of the golden lights began to dim. That was the only time that Geoffrey felt relieved. It meant that the purging of the creatures who failed the test was finally done.</p>

  <p>"Whew, I passed." Geoffrey couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, his gaze stumbled upon the cage of the little monster from before.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was still safe, and he was staring at him with a playful look as his tail wagged constantly.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey ignored him as he didn't have time for his antics. Instead, he started counting the creatures that were left. From what he saw, he concluded that about one out of ten creatures had survived, meaning that the failure rate was about ninety percent. He adjudicated that the remaining monsters must have possessed at least an average level of intelligence.</p>

  <p>He also determined that these kinds of tests would probably continue, and he just wanted them to be over.</p>

  <p>However, what he couldn't figure out was the real intention behind these tests.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to select creatures with high intelligence, was this kind of method necessary?</p>

  <p>For the first two tests, Geoffrey easily dealt with them. But he worried that if the tests' difficulty increased over time, there was no way to know for sure if he could pass them all.</p>

  <p>However, right now, he had no choice but to take them and go on until the end.</p>

  <p>About twenty-four hours later, the spiders appeared in the underground space again. This time, they were carrying six pieces of iron with different sizes and unique shapes.</p>

  <p>As soon as Geoffrey saw them, his anxious expression gradually relaxed, and a faint smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"The Eight Diagrams Lock, huh?"</p>

  <p>The pieces of iron were intertwined in a mortise-and-tenon structure. Even an adult would have a bit difficulty unlocking them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Geoffrey had been fond of playing the Eight Diagrams Lock since he was a child, and thus it should be pretty easy for him to accomplish this test.</p>

  <p>Just when he was about to begin, the little monster suddenly made a scene by quickly grabbing the Eight Diagrams Lock, and raising it towards Geoffrey. With a single gentle touch, he was able to unlock it instantly. As soon as it was done, the little monster stared at Geoffrey with a defiant and mocking expression.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey couldn't help but scoff as he thought how ridiculous it was. "Is he trying to provoke me by showing off his skill for something like this?"</p>

  <p>All of the creatures in the fifth-grade world had immeasurable strength, or at least, they were much stronger than Geoffrey. Every single one of them could easily take him down, but right now, they were held against their will and competing in these children's games.</p>
