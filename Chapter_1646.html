<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1646 Seeking </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body still felt stiff out of shock, and he reflexively wiped his eyes.</p>

  <p>He wondered if it was real or if he was just hallucinating.</p>

  <p>The girl wore an apricot silk robe on top of a brocade dress that was embroidered with flowers, which hugged her beautiful figure perfectly.</p>

  <p>She emitted a cold and aloof vibe, but she still looked breathtaking.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning... She is even ranked 43rd. Is there something wrong?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered with mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>He'd never thought that Mu Ning of all people, would participate in the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>Back then, she was even only at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Although she possessed the Purple Power Body, she never took a liking to cultivation. She even thought of the process as boring and her greatest enemy.</p>

  <p>It could even be said that ever since the two of them had met, she had never focused on her cultivation even for a day.</p>

  <p>However, how could she have survived here?</p>

  <p>How did she rank in the 43rd place?</p>

  <p>Was it just because of her Purple Power Body?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find any reason, and just gave up trying to guess.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had been separated from Mu Ning for a few years, he had naturally missed her.</p>

  <p>But, the woman he saw at this moment was greatly different from who she used to be.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had become even more elegant and mature in the last few years. She looked extremely charming and confident now. Luo Luo Zheng didn't even recognize her at first sight.</p>

  <p>"Is Mu Ning also in either of the other two blood-red castles?"</p>

  <p>The thought of being able to see Mu Ning soon sent jolts of delight down Luo Zheng's body, and his eyes sparkled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>If they happened to meet again, it would surely be a wonderful encounter.</p>

  <p>All of this meant that three people from the great world Luo Luo Zheng came from had managed to rank in the top 2, 500. Was it fate, or just a coincidence?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in another blood-red castle, a beautiful lady glanced around alone.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning scanned the statues on each floor of the pyramid. The fabric of her clothes fluttered in the wind as she walked, her eyes full of nervousness.</p>

  <p>"There is no Luo Zheng's statue on this floor..."</p>

  <p>"His statue also isn't on this floor..."</p>

  <p>She kept muttering to herself as she hovered in the air, her palms becoming increasingly shaky because of anxiety.</p>

  <p>At that moment, someone had followed Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>It was a warrior dressed in an embroidered robe who also flew up to tail behind her.</p>

  <p>The warrior looked quite young and appeared to be less than 20 years old, but his eyes looked rather cold.</p>

  <p>While Mu Ning observed the statues, the warrior stared at her all the time.</p>

  <p>The first floor, the second floor, the third floor...</p>

  <p>Mu Ning looked around floor by floor, and her disappointment grew. She pouted in annoyance and thought, 'The higher I go, the less likely I would find Luo Luo Zheng!'</p>

  <p>Soon enough, she discovered that someone had been following her.</p>

  <p>She was already in a bad mood. Her head suddenly whipped around and her enchanting eyes gleamed with a hint of anger. "Why are you following me?"</p>

  <p>It turned out that the warrior had followed her all the way. Xi Youqin's unique Mu Ning had apparently attracted him from the moment he entered the blood-red castle, and he was about to make friends with her.</p>

  <p>But when he saw Mu Ning seemed to be seriously looking for something, he didn't try to talk to her. Now that she had suddenly coldly called him out, he was a bit surprised.</p>

  <p>No one had ever dared to berate him like that, even when he was young.</p>

  <p>Even the Saint Lords and the world lords were rather polite and respectful to him...</p>

  <p>That was because he was a Godly Genius and had activated a total of 36 petals of the Hinayana Lotus Flower and the Mahayana Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>He was Nathan Xuanyuan, who had ranked first in the first part of the first stage in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had already recognized him the moment he entered the blood-red castle.</p>

  <p>A lot of them deliberately kept a certain distance from him, but there were also some of them who wanted to become friends with the legendary Godly Genius for the benefits.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan's attention was solely focused on Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Just as Nathan was stunned, Mu Ning leaped up once more and her body danced as she stood on the fourth floor of the pyramid. Then she continued her search for Luo Zheng's statue.</p>

  <p>The astonishment on Nathan's face only lasted for an instant before it disappeared without a trace. He looked at Xi Youqin's back and became increasingly interested in her.</p>

  <p>He followed behind her again and said, "You seem to be looking for something, right? My name is Nathan Xuanyuan, and I can help you..."</p>

  <p>There was a high possibility that Nathan could be one of the several warriors in the entire universe who could go beyond the heavens. After all, he was destined to be the key player in this world of chaos, and would be the strongest among his peers!</p>

  <p>If it was up to him, he wouldn't have told Mu Ning his name, but she didn't know him and was also extremely aloof, which made him a bit upset.</p>

  <p>But when he introduced himself, Mu Ning should have realized something...</p>

  <p>She stopped and turned her head to stare back at Nathan, who looked indifferent. He could almost guess what she was going to say next...</p>

  <p>"You are Nathan Xuanyuan?</p>

  <p>The legendary Godly Genius of the Thoughtless Minds?"</p>

  <p>Nathan had already heard of this kind of words countless times, and he was tired of them.</p>

  <p>However, to hear it from a beautiful woman was different.</p>

  <p>He felt pleased.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning just blinked at him a few times.</p>

  <p>"Nathan Xuanyuan? Who on earth are you? Please don't follow me!" she said with a frown.</p>

  <p>She was so annoyed that she didn't bother being patient to him. After she finished her words, she rushed upwards once more.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning never cared about the strongest warriors in the universe, the number of the Supreme Lords and the world lords, and their relationships with each other.</p>

  <p>Many warriors often discussed such things among themselves, as if they personally knew those remarkable warriors so well.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mu Ning wasn't interested in them at all. She only kept practicing martial arts for so many years because of a few words that the old man Nameless had said to her.</p>

  <p>He told her that if she cultivated, she could surprise Luo Luo Zheng and spend much more time accompanying him.</p>

  <p>She only cared about Luo Luo Zheng, and had no interest in Nathan. It also went to say that she didn't care even if he was the most famous talent in the universe. Besides, she didn't know him at all.</p>

  <p>The other warriors in the pyramid were now focused on Nathan's movements. All of them secretly sniggered when they saw him get ignored by Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that Nathan can also be in such an embarrassing situation!"</p>

  <p>"That woman is so full of herself. It's impossible that she hasn't even heard of Nathan."</p>

  <p>"I really admire that girl. It doesn't matter if she really doesn't know him, or if she pretends to..."</p>

  <p>"Some foxy women out there pretend to ignore warriors first, before they'd take advantage of them. Those who could enter the second stage of the competition surely have studied about the talents in the universe."</p>

  <p>More and more hushed whispers and low chatters could be heard.</p>

  <p>Nathan had even heard some of their comments.</p>

  <p>He looked a bit displeased and his eyes appeared even colder than it was possible. His left eyebrow twitched in irritation, but he followed Mu Ning again.</p>

  <p>He had never failed to do anything in his life.</p>

  <p>Even his mere existence was a miracle in itself.</p>

  <p>Even when he had to transcend the heavens and become a True God, he absolutely would not fail!</p>

  <p>That was the strength of a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was strong-willed, and her attitude aroused some kind of primitive desire to conquer her in his heart.</p>

  <p>Nathan wasn't particularly fond of women. However, he was also a young man and was bound to be infatuated with a woman someday like other men. Right now he was the one attracted to Mu Ning, even though he couldn't explain why it was the case.</p>

  <p>After a few more minutes of hovering, Mu Ning had reached the upper part of the pyramid. Her eyes suddenly lit up with pleasant surprise!</p>

  <p>"He is ranked 77th! I knew it... I've always believed that you would come here! You definitely didn't let me down!"</p>

  <p>She had finally found Luo Zheng's statue at the floor she currently stood!</p>

  <p>Mu Ning didn't think twice and quickly rushed towards Luo Zheng's statue. She reached out and touched the statue's face, her eyes filled with affection.</p>

  <p>This face had appeared in her dreams countless times in the past six years.</p>

  <p>She'd imagined the moment when she finally met Luo Luo Zheng too many times.</p>

  <p>Now that she had found his statue here, it only meant that he was in another blood-red castle!</p>

  <p>'There seems to be no way to go to another blood-red castle, ' Mu Ning thought as her eyes flashed. She had really wanted to fly to Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>However, the rules of the Illusion Battlefield prevented her from doing such things.</p>

  <p>Nathan finally caught up to Mu Ning, who he saw was happily holding and caressing a statue's face. He pulled a long face when he saw that it was a statue of a man with delicate features.</p>

  <p>He also felt a strong sense of disappointment, and he couldn't help but feel very frustrated.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked flatly. He kept an aloof fa?ade in an attempt to restrain his foul mood.</p>
