<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the darkness on the other side, warriors were in a daze, looking confused but seemed to be alert.</p>

  <p>There were ten warriors stood in a row, staring deeply into the mist opposite them.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the mist on the other side looked eerily thick as it gradually spread out, forming countless illusions� humans, snakes, insects, all the creatures in the universe. It only took several moments until the fog had starkly covered up the seven of them.</p>

  <p>"Swish�"</p>

  <p>Amidst the darkness, someone threw out a long hook! They all heard a hissing sound.</p>

  <p>The long hook resembled a spear. It crossed a distance of three thousand feet and flew straight into the fog!</p>

  <p>However, as the hook disappeared into the creepy fog, the figure the hook got in contact was only an illusion. Shortly after it dissipated, the hook returned without any gains.</p>

  <p>Some warrior behind the thick, creepy fog also threw out the hook, mimicking the warrior on the other side.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior was hooked from the other side, they could attack that one in groups to achieve an instant kill!</p>

  <p>For example, after Cain was hooked onto the other side, he didn't even have the strength to fight back before exploding into a ball of Illusion Points and being sent back to the main city.</p>

  <p>Right now, one side had exerted a Dark Law, while the other had summoned the fog to cover them up. Both parties were well hidden.</p>

  <p>These long hooks flew back and forth above the three thousand feet wide abyss for several times, but they were ultimately unable to get a single warrior.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! It's the Illusive Fog. One of those warriors is from the Blessed Buddha Land!"</p>

  <p id="top_6">The leader of the ten warriors was also a human. He looked weak and thin as a bamboo stick, but there was a sharp glint in his eyes. It was as if there were two knives hidden in his calm eyes!</p>

  <p>"They should have passed the first two Halls of Causality as well, and they have already lost two teammates. Now we have killed one more of them, so the team should only have seven left. Ha-ha! They are not that strong!" Another warrior laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>"Lone alone can deal with the left seven warriors, right? The third Hall of Causality is so easy to pass through," someone exclaimed in the darkness.</p>

  <p>If one side wanted to pass through the third Hall of Causality, they would have to kill all the warriors on the other side.</p>

  <p>The entryway to Zheng's group was the exit to these ten warriors, and the entrance to the ten was the exit to Zheng's group of seven!</p>

  <p>And the only way to get through the third Hall of Causality was to kill all the warriors on the other's path.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Lone is an ace talent! How could there be a match for him?</p>

  <p>If we were to send Lone over, those fellows on the other side would be killed in a blink of an eye!" another warrior butted in.</p>

  <p>"But the ones on the other side have the Illusive Fog to shield them. It's difficult to get them here through the hooks," someone spoke hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Big deal! They won't be able to break through my Dark Law as well," another warrior pointed out in the darkness. It was obvious that the Dark Law was set up by him.</p>

  <p>The rules of this Hall of Causality stated that each warrior of both parties should hold a long hook. The two parties would oppose each other across the abyss. To win the battle, they had to kill the warriors on the other side, one by one.</p>

  <p>In a stricter sense, the difficulties of the third Hall of Causality were way more than that of before.</p>

  <p>And only one team could pass this Hall of Causality. All the losers then would be sent back to the main city.</p>

  <p>What created the current situation wasn't because of a single warrior, but it was for the reason that the competition in the Illusion Battlefield had become more and more intense, and the tension between warriors would get worse as well. The strong would gather more and more Illusion Points. But if lower-level warriors failed even once, it would be very tough for them to get up.</p>

  <p>"Oh! It's all crap! What you do can't soil the fog at all. Are we afraid of the other side? Remove that stupid thing. It's so black in here that we can't see anything!" A tall figure kept ranting in the darkness. It was a 10 feet tall ogre.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I set up this Dark Law to protect everyone!" The warrior burst out in disagreement.</p>

  <p>"I don't need your protection. I stand right here, and I want to see who dares to provoke me!" the ogre shouted again.</p>

  <p>"You�"</p>

  <p>The two of them started arguing.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw that," the one named Lone insisted indifferently. "Remove the Dark Law around Damon."</p>

  <p>"Lone! Are you sure about that?" the warrior asked.</p>

  <p>"Damon, if they were to see you, they would probably hook you over. If that case happens, remember to drag me over too," Lone said airily. "But you still need to be careful. The ones who can enter the Hall of Causality are all strong after all."</p>

  <p>The ogre named Damon laughed, "Ha-ha! Don't worry! They are just a bunch of cowards. They only know how to hide in the fog and don't dare to fight a real battle. If I go over, I'll defeat them all. Why should we be afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate your opponents," Lone urged. "You go first, and then turn around and pull me over through your hook!"</p>

  <p>There was a faint trace of unquestionable power in Lone's tone.</p>

  <p>Damon held a high status among the ogres and was an unruly and untamable warrior. Not to mention the warriors of other races, even the elders of the ogres found it hard to make him listen to them.</p>

  <p>However, Damon was docile in front of Lone, because he saved his life in the second Hall of Causality. To be exact, Lone had broken through the intractable situation in the second Hall of Causality by himself and brought the other nine warriors across the second test safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Everyone was extremely impressed with Lone!</p>

  <p>After hearing Lone's words, Damon nodded his head and assured him, in a respectful tone, "I remember that already, Lone. As long as I go over, I will definitely pull you over. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"Alright! Get ready," Lone countered indifferently.</p>

  <p>Not before long, there was a sudden change strangely occurring on one side of the abyss. Total murkiness shrouded it obscurely, but now part of the darkness had caved in!</p>

  <p>In a seemingly tense atmosphere, a burly figure holding a giant golden pestle gradually revealed himself. It was the tall ogre, Damon.</p>

  <p>Behind the fog, Luo Zheng, Janet, Jeffrey, Hailey, and the rest all had their eyes fixed on that ogre inching his way up.</p>

  <p>Previously, they made several attempts throwing the hooks to get the ones over to their sides but to no avail, causing the situation to become somewhat ill at ease like they were in tenterhooks!</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng could discern some shadows in the darkness with his magical eyes, the shadows were still quite blurry. Besides, his enemies on the other side were also quite vigilant. He had tried to hook one of them over three times but always failed in the end.</p>

  <p>But this time, not only his opponents had voluntarily removed part of the power of the Dark Law, but they also pushed that ogre out of the darkness. What was this supposed to mean?</p>

  <p>In that span of a moment, the warriors on Zheng's side all felt uneasy and became hesitant altogether.</p>

  <p>"Did they do it on purpose?" Jeffrey uttered under his breath as he stared hard at the tall ogre.</p>

  <p>"That should be it! It is more likely that they are conjuring some kind of a trick up in their sleeves." Janet nodded as she quickly assumed.</p>

  <p>Coleman closely watched the ogre across the abyss, and his mouth was wide open as he was stunned. He finally exclaimed, "That, that, is Damon!"</p>

  <p>"Damon?" Luo Zheng stared at Coleman as he heard the latter's sudden outburst.</p>

  <p>Coleman nodded. He seemed to have recognized the ogre across the abyss. "This is Supreme Lord Mathias's only son, Damon! Even this guy also comes here! This � this � This Hall of Causality is too difficult to pass!"</p>

  <p>Jeffrey glanced at Coleman and probed him further, "Is this guy that strong? I have never heard the one named Damon among the ace talents of the ogres."</p>

  <p>As far as Jeffrey was concerned, their opponents wouldn't be too difficult to deal with as long as they weren't the ace talents from those famous races or groups.</p>

  <p>"No! He is not an ace talent, because his fate is not strong enough to be one. But, his strength and talent are not inferior to any of ace talents!"</p>

  <p>Coleman continued.</p>

  <p>Whether being an ace talent or Godly Genius, a warrior had to have the fate to lead the world of chaos. But it would never mean that the ones who had such a destiny were qualified to be ace talents.</p>

  <p>What Coleman wanted to say was simple. The ogre couldn't be an ace talent merely because he was not fated to be one. But with such strength, his power should not be underestimated!</p>

  <p>Thus, after hearing Coleman's words, Jeffrey, Janet, and the others eventually wore a solemn expression, especially now that the ogre had the confidence to stand there, and wait for them to make a move!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gripped the hook hard in his hand, and keenly observed the ogre. He noted that there was a river filled with illusory energy, as he shifted his gaze from the ogre down to the deep ravine.</p>

  <p>Regardless of this warrior's strength, there was no way for him to break free from the laws of the heavens contained within the hook. The moment the ogre was hooked over, he would be on the defensive and have no way to get rid of it.</p>

  <p>Yet, he was beaming with confidence. He must be relying on something else.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was currently in deep thought contemplating about that, Damon across the three-thousand-foot-wide ravine roared provokingly, "Hey!</p>

  <p>The bunch of cowards over there! I am standing right here. Even now, none of you dare to make a move against me? You guys really suck!</p>

  <p>Why don't you give up as soon as possible? Remove that mist! Come over to kneel and beg for mercy from me. I can let you die a little faster!</p>

  <p>Come on! Throw your hook! Hook me over! I will never fight back, and never curse back!"</p>
