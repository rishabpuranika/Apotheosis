  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Whether he survives or not, it's only him who would have to endure it in the end. So, let's just enjoy the show."</p>

  <p>Way up above this abyssal place, an enormous disk-shaped platform appeared. Luo Luo Zheng and the prince of the divine kingdom then, in turn, went ahead and stepped foot onto the platform.</p>

  <p>"I always feel you are annoying, but it appears that you have fortunately pulled through and taken the lead." The prince of the divine kingdom let out a daunting chuckle, "But I'm afraid this will be the end of the line for you.</p>

  <p>This is where you're going to bite the dust."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked him, giving him a look of suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Because I am going to kill you, that's why. Haha!" The second the prince of the divine kingdom was done talking, he instantly became exceedingly more aggressive and vicious. As a capable master of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, how on earth could he possibly take someone he considered insignificant such as Luo Luo Zheng seriously? Luo Luo Zheng could be comparable to an ant at the Illuminating Soul Realm in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Hearing such an arrogant statement, Luo Luo Zheng simply rolled his eyes, thinking that the prince was somewhat of a halfwit. But if he was going to be completely honest, there were times when it would be much more enjoyable to poke fun at some idiot just like him. At the thought of that, with a single light tap on his space ring, he brought out his sword, one which was a low-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"You chose a sacred weapon, huh? Quite fascinating! I never would've thought that a sacred sword would be so run-of-the-mill in that Central Region of yours. Even a no-name warrior in the Illuminating Soul Realm could wield a sacred weapon! That's ridiculous!" Thereafter, the prince of the divine kingdom had drawn out a sword as well, but his was a snake-shaped one. This sword in particular had a curved blade akin to the body of a snake, with a golden embellishment right in the middle. This was another low-grade treasured sword categorized as a sacred weapon as well.</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter was that the prince of the divine kingdom had deliberately planned to show off his abilities in front of this crowd of country dwellers in the Central Region and let them know what a sacred weapon was.</p>

  <p>That being said, he wasn't really expecting to see a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm bring out a sacred weapon right before his very eyes. It was such a sight to behold! Truly magnificent! The prince of the divine kingdom's jaws almost fell on the floor after being caught off guard.</p>

  <p>Of course, it came as no surprise that the residents of the Central Region did not appreciate the prince of the divine kingdom's way with words. There was no way that those sacred weapons could be so inexpensive and as common as muck in the Central Region! In reality, only a handful of people were in possession of such a weapon in the Central Region. Luo Luo Zheng was something of an irregularity. He was indeed a special case.</p>

  <p>"But what does it matter if you hold a sacred weapon? In my honest opinion, I think it is too much of a waste that a heaven's treasure ended up being in the hands of someone like you! I'm gonna send you straight to hell!" The prince of the divine kingdom's body flashed without warning, and with great strength, the snake-shaped sword's edge had been directed toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Viper Strike!"</p>

  <p>The prince of the divine kingdom lifted his sword and pierced the space in front of him. His sword appeared as though it was a serpent hissing through the air and coming straight at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng had been planning to utilize the circle parry to stave off the prince's attack, the sword which looked as if it was approaching him head on abruptly changed its course, evading Luo Zheng's iron sword, and as a result, Luo Luo Zheng had gotten struck in the chest.</p>

  <p>"That was quite a masterful and nimble-fingered swordsmanship! And with such a powerful sword intent to top it all off!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng heaved a heavy sigh and hurriedly pulled away. Blocking that sword proved to be quite difficult!</p>

  <p>But, as luck would have it, he only received a flesh wound on his chest, so it wasn't really deep?</p>

  <p>Given that the prince of the divine kingdom had successfully gotten first strike before Luo Luo Zheng could do anything, there was no way he would've just let him off so easily. With a wave of the long sword he was holding, it swayed in the air and darted toward Luo Luo Zheng uncontrollably, much like the shadow of a snake.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew full well that those snake shadows flooding the sky were actually sword shadows. To make things worse, these sword shadows ceaselessly shifted directions, making it much too impossible for him to find a way to make use of his sword and block his enemy's incoming attacks.</p>

  <p>"Sad to say, this arena is not wide enough. You have nowhere else to run to in here," the prince of the divine kingdom stated for a fact as a conceited smile crept onto his face.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Taking one step forward, Luo Luo Zheng made his way across the space, swiftly moving over to the other edge of the platform. Upon pulling a move like that, he couldn't help himself from letting out a faint smile, and he said,</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously think I have nowhere to run?"</p>

  <p>"Space Law?" The prince of the divine kingdom had been left dumbfounded, with his eyes revealing signs of great astonishment.</p>

  <p>Now it made so much sense why this brat seemed so full of himself right off the bat. It had become clear as day that in spite of being a warrior of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he had actually grasped the Space Law already.</p>

  <p>And if one ever wished to walk through space, before anything else, he needed to acquire a full understanding of the first level of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Even among all of the four divine kingdoms, there were only a select few who had succeeded in understanding the first level of the Space Law. But it should be noted that this small group of people had all been old men who had either lived for several thousand years or maybe even over ten thousand years!</p>

  <p>Just how old could this kid standing in front of him possibly be? His appearance was just like that of a teenage boy! What had he done to receive such great luck in a short span of time? If he recalled correctly, wasn't the Sky Northern Region nothing more than desolate wasteland? How on earth could he have come across such a great opportunity?</p>

  <p>The prince was at such a loss for words, standing there in complete disbelief, wondering if his eyes could have just been playing tricks on him.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, the resolve he had to end Luo Zheng's life had not faltered, and he would never let anything stand in his way. As it turned out, Luo Luo Zheng had mastery of the Space Law, who cared about that? That was nothing but a trivial matter. His cultivation level was so much lower than his. So, it should make no difference no matter how many laws he had comprehended.</p>

  <p>In the end, it would still be of no use when fighting against the prince of the divine kingdom!</p>

  <p>"You can go to hell! I'm going to pulverize you, puny ant!" With his snake-shaped sword, the prince of the divine kingdom then bolted toward Luo Luo Zheng once more to come at him head-on.</p>
