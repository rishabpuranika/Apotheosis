<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2844 Breaking The Jade Harp Array </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The members of the Dongfang Clan were shocked.</p>

  <p>Since Nicholas died, they had relied heavily on Pierson, but to their surprise, Pierson couldn't deflect a single blow from his opponent.</p>

  <p>A Demi-holy Being from the Dongfang Clan frowned slightly. A small jade harp appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>He raised the jade harp and yelled, "Set an array!"</p>

  <p>The jade harp trembled.</p>

  <p>The entire Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan also started shaking.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had been the most powerful clan in the divine land for years, so their island was well equipped.</p>

  <p>It appeared to be the same as those of other clans, but the interior was woven with the branches of the Ray Tree. The branches were combined with the divine textures and formed a large array within the island.</p>

  <p>Someone once said that the large array would never be used because no one dared to stir up trouble on the Dongfang Clan's island.</p>

  <p>However, one could never predict what life had in store for you. A month ago, everyone in the divine land followed the Dongfang Clan's lead, and it held high status among all the clans. One month later however, it was in jeopardy.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the Floating Island vibrated, rings of light spread across every inch of the island.</p>

  <p>Almost every disciple of the Dongfang Clan saw the light. Some disciples who were far away from the scene had no idea what was going on, but they knew what the light meant and stepped into it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Plop, plop!</p>

  <p>All the consummate and ordinary True Gods stepped into the rings of light and got down on one knee. At the same time, they offered the Faith Energy in their own inner worlds and started murmuring something.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan enjoys everlasting prosperity. We control the sun..."</p>

  <p>They were chanting the ancestral doctrine of the Dongfang Clan. As they occupied the Ray Tree, they were the first in the divine land to see the sun every day. Therefore, they claimed that the sun belonged to their clan.</p>

  <p>The turbulent Faith Energy quickly passed through the rings of light under their feet and gathered on the jade harp which was in the Demi-holy Being's hand.</p>

  <p>At this point, the jade harp erupted with terrifying power!</p>

  <p>The shock wave of power spread out, radiating on the Floating Islands below.</p>

  <p>Various clans, like the Han Clan, the Leng Clan and the Tang Clan, gathered and started whispering among themselves.</p>

  <p>Everyone raised their heads to look up, their faces solemn with concern.</p>

  <p>"It is so powerful!"</p>

  <p>"It has to be from the Dongfang Clan! But what's going on? Are they facing a strong enemy? Who is so bold as to attack the most powerful clan?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, don't forget Nicholas is dead now! If the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan want to wage a war, who in the Dongfang Clan can stop them?"</p>

  <p>"But the Dongfang Clan is rich and powerful."</p>

  <p>"So what? They are like abandoned puppies now."</p>

  <p>The members of other powerful clans were gloating, except those who belonged to the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time we are using the Smoky Sea Array after it was built," said the Demi-holy Being holding the jade harp. "If you surrender, I will remove the array. If you resist, I will show no mercy!"</p>

  <p>Winthrop, who was also standing in a ring of light and offering the Faith Energy in his inner world, said, "Lowell, I don't know what happened to you in the Abyss Demon Region, but we don't need to go this far, as long as we clarify certain things."</p>

  <p>Tianming finally decided to step forward and ignore his conflicting feelings.</p>

  <p>He bowed to Winthrop and said, "I am sorry, Father-in-law. My real name is not Lowell. My name is Hua Tianming, and I am from the Evolutionary Universe."</p>

  <p>Naturally, Winthrop was surprised.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, he had also suspected Tianming's identity all this while.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan was quite conservative when it came to marriage. Most of the people married their clansmen, and very few married those from the outside. But Iris was determined to marry Lowell, and Winthrop could do nothing to convince her otherwise.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that Lowell was working for the sworn enemy of the Dongfang Clan?</p>

  <p>"Your real name is Tianming? Hh... That guy... He just said that he and you killed our Holy Emperor together. Is that true?" Winthrop couldn't control the quiver in his voice.</p>

  <p>Tianming pursed his lips and said seriously, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"You bastard! You are talking nonsense. Since you don't regret it, I will turn you to dust!" The Demi-holy Being who held the jade harp finally made his move.</p>

  <p>As the jade harp shook gently, the strings emitted multicolored lights, which looked like ripples on a lake. There was a unique charm and a strong killing intent hidden in them.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you don't believe me, I will prove it to you!" Zheng floated up in the air, sneering coldly. "When I stepped into the Time Sea, I thought that one day I would slaughter your clan's Floating Island! But circumstances change with the passage of time. Some old scores have been evened. I don't want to destroy the island anymore."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a long sword appeared magically in his hand.</p>

  <p>Many red lotuses with devastating auras spilled out from the blade of the sword.</p>

  <p>When the people from the Dongfang Clan saw the red lotuses, they blinked hard.</p>

  <p>"How could he possess such terrifying power?"</p>

  <p>"Is he really a consummate True God?"</p>

  <p>"Even a Holy Being can't wield such power, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng hovered in midair, holding the long sword in his hand. He had no intention of making a move.</p>

  <p>"You arrogant jerk! Go to hell!" The Demi-holy Being began to play the strings.</p>

  <p>The previously mild music suddenly became hurried, wild and full of killing intent.</p>

  <p>The lights emitted from the strings turned into colorful swords and zoomed towards Zheng ferociously.</p>

  <p>But Zheng appeared unfazed. He neither dodged nor defended himself, allowing them to attack him.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>

  <p>The attack from the light was no less than a blow by a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The large array of the Dongfang Clan was set up based on the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>And it was really effective and powerful.</p>

  <p>But their opponent, Zheng, was formidable.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of light swords hit Zheng's body, but he was unharmed.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?" Winthrop and the others just stared at Zheng floating nonchalantly in midair.</p>

  <p>"This method can even kill Holy Beings. But why is it not working on him?"</p>

  <p>"He seems completely unaffected by it."</p>

  <p>"What a mighty fellow!"</p>

  <p>The entire Dongfang Clan was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Even the Demi-holy Being, who was playing the jade harp, was getting more and more vicious. He started playing the jade harp more and more quickly!</p>

  <p>"I don't think you can block them all!" the Demi-holy Being roared.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't pay attention to him but lowered his head and said to Tianming,</p>

  <p>"It's your turn!"</p>

  <p>When the light swords attacked Zheng, most of the energy was transferred to Tianming's body, leaving only golden halos on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded, pulled out his Soaring Snake Sword and got ready to defend.</p>

  <p>When the first chill collected at the sword tip, Tianming turned the Soaring Snake Sword and suddenly jabbed it into the ground.</p>

  <p>Countless ice flowers circled Tianming. Gradually, they all poured down along the Soaring Snake Sword and into the ground.</p>

  <p>The ice flowers were able to solidify all kinds of energies. When a massive amount of ice flowers fell onto the ground, they instantly condensed and froze the branches of the Ray Tree distributed on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The branches of the Ray Tree supported the Smoky Sea Array. If all the branches were frozen, the array would collapse just like that.</p>

  <p>Before long, the power that had gathered on the jade harp disappeared without a trace.</p>
