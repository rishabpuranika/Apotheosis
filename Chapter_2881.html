<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From a bird's eye view, the backyard of the fairy palace appeared dotted with numerous neat, ornamental courtyards.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had gained control over the palace, it had blossomed and bloomed with new life, and looked like a completely different place to the barren ruin it had resembled before.</p>

  <p>Everyone noticed this transformation. Yudie and Aura, however, craved something other. The distant vision of the divine land enticed them with its mystery.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was away, they would spend their time studying in the library and practicing, cultivating their skills to learn more about the world beyond the palace.</p>

  <p>And even when immersed in their studies, they daydreamed about the beautiful landscapes of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"What happened to your promise? You told me you would show me the Time Sea..."</p>

  <p>Yudie pleaded, lazily laying her pale leg across Zheng's body, searching his eyes with her own. Despite having a significant cultivation base and superior physical strength, she felt intimacy with Zheng exhausted her.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. You won't have to wait much longer," Zheng answered with a smile, stroking her forehead with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Zheng caught himself thinking whether he was behaving selfishly by making his wives stay inside the fairy palace. He had reasoned that he was doing it for their safety, but now he doubted whether his motives were motivated more by his own desire.</p>

  <p>Yet, he consoled himself with the fact that he had made that decision in the face of imminent danger to his father's life.</p>

  <p>If something had happened to Zheng's father, the entire Evolutionary Universe would have collapsed, and no living creature would have survived. He had made this decision as a last resort.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng had started cultivating in seclusion, Xun had also expressed the desire to visit and see the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>As the queen of the Demon Night, she naturally still cared about her people.</p>

  <p>Zheng had agreed to grant her wish.</p>

  <p>Once he managed to master the three thousand Godly Ways, he would ask his father to help make it come true.</p>

  <p>Mike, as the one who owned the Evolutionary Universe, was the most appropriate person to ask. After all, he had easy access to it.</p>

  <p>However, despite Zheng's attempts to reassure her, Yudie was not convinced.</p>

  <p>"Unlike the last time, your current problem isn't as simple, is it?" she asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Zheng had not, in fact, divulged all the details of the current situation in the divine land to his wives.</p>

  <p>They had the best intentions and made the utmost effort to assist him, but their abilities left much to be desired. Thus, Zheng decided it best to keep them in the dark about the full extent of the challenges he faced, as that information would do nothing but cause them to panic.</p>

  <p>Unlike Zheng, however, Augustus was not good at keeping secrets. Once he found something out, the entire palace would be gossiping about it in no time. No matter how many times Hallet asked him to keep quiet, he just could not keep his mouth shut.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could answer, Yudie had already encircled him with her arms and said, "There's no need to answer me. I don't want to know..."</p>

  <p>A day passed. Mike, with Zheng in tow, had teleported to the Illusion Region, which lay 30 million miles east.</p>

  <p>The last time Zheng had decided to go on a mission to absorb Godly Ways, he had traveled south. Now, he journeyed towards the rising sun with the help of Mike.</p>

  <p>So far, it had been an easy journey. Just two attempts at the Grand Teleportation technique got them to the Illusion Region.</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Godly Way Tablet lies three hundred miles north of the central divine city," recited Zheng.</p>

  <p>Some navigators of the divine land had drawn maps that showed the locations of the Godly Way Tablets. However, these maps often contained errors, and all of them failed to record every one of the tablets.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was lucky to have received the guidance of the Infinity Ruler, thanks to which he had effectively constructed a complete and comprehensive map of the Godly Way Tablets in his head.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!"</p>

  <p>Mike exclaimed richly as he led Zheng into the space channel.</p>

  <p>As soon as they emerged from the space channel, they were met by the sight of an enormous tree, floating below them.</p>

  <p>"What in the world is that?" Zheng was rather baffled. From the information he had stored in his head, there should have been a Godly Way Tablet in the place of this huge tree.</p>

  <p>Mike, however, responded with a smile. "It is an illusion. The Illusion Godly Way is not called that for no reason: its internal momentum can create extremely powerful mirages. The tablet is indeed here. It created this tree in the first place! If you look at it carefully, you will know!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed at his father's words.</p>

  <p>He did as instructed, and scrutinized the tree closely. Indeed, now that he concentrated his gaze on it, he noticed a pale rivulet of light running along the tree: the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"Go on," urged his father.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave a curt nod, and circled downwards, finally landing next to the tree.</p>

  <p>There was a bizarrely random collection of objects lying around the tree, including a chair, some seedlings, and an odd-looking rock.</p>

  <p>"These...are humans," Zheng realized. These people hadn't mastered the Illusion Godly Way very well, so Zheng could immediately see through their illusions.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had landed on the ground, the two people masquerading as seedlings approached him. As they regained their human form, they asked Zheng who he was and what he wanted. From his studies, Zheng knew that if he truly wanted to understand the Illusion Godly Way, there was a price he had to pay.</p>

  <p>Before the two could say anything else, Zheng handed them a few divine might coins that he had prepared.</p>

  <p>He had a large amount of Godly Ways to imbibe, and the time he had was limited. Thus, he didn't want to waste a second more than he needed to.</p>

  <p>He had given the two men over a hundred divine might coins, which he gathered to be a more-than-sufficient amount.</p>

  <p>The two men before him, who were both top-rank True Gods, looked at each other slyly. They decided to take advantage of Zheng's generosity. "It takes a thousand divine might coins to observe the Illusion Godly Way Tablet!" one of them scoffed.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. He had paid them generously in order to end this affair quickly and unceremoniously, but it seemed like he had complicated the situation further.</p>

  <p>A thick aura covered the air before Zheng could do anything else.</p>

  <p>The two top-rank True Gods' expressions shifted immediately from self-contented smugness to surprise, and then awe, as they sensed the aura and then looked up and noticed Mike.</p>

  <p>The others who had disguised themselves as objects around the tree, observing the tablet, were also engulfed in this aura. However, their cultivation level was still weak, and their illusions would not hold. They all regained their human form, and looked up at Mike, trembling.</p>

  <p>Seeing his father's actions, Zheng smiled sheepishly.</p>

  <p>Zheng was humbled by him. His technique was indeed very effective, saving precious time that would have been wasted arguing with the two greedy top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>This small central divine city wasn't connected to the rich clans on the Floating Islands. Even if these people were to try spreading the news of Zheng and Mike's arrival, Zheng and Mike would have already been long gone by the time the information reached the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked past the two True Gods, the light rings in his eyes began to glint.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler had begun absorbing the internal momentum of the Illusion Godly Way.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, another mark on the Infinity Ruler lit up, and another light glimmered on Zheng's Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>He had finally mastered the Illusion Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Once the process was done, Zheng didn't stay a second longer. Under the astonished gaze of the crowd, Mike swept Zheng away.</p>

  <p>Only then did the two top-rank True Gods, who had collected his divine might coins, dare to move.</p>

  <p>The observers of the tablet began arguing amongst themselves. "Was that man in the sky a consummate True God?"</p>

  <p>"He must be! His demeanor was surely that of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>And that young man must be his son. He must be less than one hundred years old, and yet he has already become a top-rank True God. I wonder which first-tier clan he comes from... "</p>

  <p>"But what does he need the Godly Way Tablet for? Was he able to comprehend the Illusion Godly Way in such a short time?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, stop talking nonsense! That is impossible! Even if he was one of the talented sons of the rich clans on the Floating Islands, which I doubt he was anyway, there is no way he could fully comprehend the Illusion Godly Way in such a short time... "</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the observers continued to speculate about Zheng's and Mike's identities, the subjects of their debate had already reached the next Godly Way Tablet.</p>
