<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1827 The Collapsing Mountain Warriors </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes practically popped out of their sockets as the colossal body of the Formless Sky Python smashed to the other side, creating a deep hole in the ground.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected this at all.</p>

  <p>Were the aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land really this powerful?</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python was easily on the same level as a Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the power the three people released had directly knocked down the Formless Sky Python.</p>

  <p>"Boo...hoo..."</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python wailed. It wriggled twice in an attempt to right its position. The woman was prey and it wasn't about to let its meal go just like that.</p>

  <p>Just as it was to get up, the three Collapsing Mountain members went for the python and threw themselves into its vital point.</p>

  <p>They were relatively large and sturdy, standing at nearly ten feet and as bulky as ogres, but next to the Formless Sky Python, the three were comparable to grains of sand.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At the impact of the three's attack, the Formless Sky Python once again crashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>With another howl, it twisted its body in frustration. It didn't dare disobey the Collapsing Mountain warriors any longer and with a loud rumbling sound, it drilled head-first into the ground.</p>

  <p>Just before it completely disappeared, however, the head on the tip of its tail narrowed it eyes and roared at the princess.</p>

  <p>Seeing the group of three closing in on it again, it quickly followed the rest of its body and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched the Formless Sky Python leave and asked the princess,</p>

  <p>"That thing seems to hold a very deep grudge against you. Why does it want to eat you so bad? What did you do to offend it?"</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, the thing had chased after the woman beside him. Was the princess's flesh really more delicious than the others'? Was she really that appetizing to the Formless Sky Python?</p>

  <p>"I did not do anything!" the princess scowled.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't offend it, then why was it hell-bent on eating you?" Luo Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>The princess pursed her lips. It was obvious she didn't want to tell Luo Zheng the truth, so he didn't pursue the topic any further. The warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race then approached.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>About thirteen warriors stood in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One by one, they went airborne and landed on silver boulders. Some of them stood on top of the boulders while others hung upside down, all of them attracted to the boulders like iron to a magnet.</p>

  <p>One of the three warriors who fought off the Formless Sky Python landed on the same boulder Luo Zheng and the princess were on.</p>

  <p>The warrior sized up Luo Zheng, and a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes when he noticed his level of cultivation.</p>

  <p>With his cultivation at the Spirit Supreme Realm, to be able to stand on his own was already amazing.</p>

  <p>"Hand over your trial tallies!" The warrior commanded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned in confusion. "What trial tallies?" Unsure of the warrior's cultivation level, Luo Zheng felt a great deal of pressure. And as for the trial tallies, he honestly had no idea what they were.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who barges into this place will die without a trial tally," the warrior said, clenching his fists.</p>

  <p>The strength that this warrior displayed was very much still vivid on Zheng's mind. If he had so much as punched Luo Zheng once, Luo Zheng was sure his physical body would be smashed into smithereens.</p>

  <p>Alarmed, Luo Zheng glanced at the princess.</p>

  <p>She definitely knew more about the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land than him. However, when they barged into this place, she only said that the Collapsing Mountain warriors were very troublesome. She didn't mention anything about trial tallies. Luo Zheng swallowed. Was he going to be killed because he didn't have a trial tally?</p>

  <p>"I have a trial tally," the princess smiled. "In fact, I have several trial tallies."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt his heart rate go back to normal. With her position, of course she'd have whatever this trial tally was.</p>

  <p>For the first time that day, Luo Zheng finally felt a stroke of luck. At least this woman wasn't all trouble.</p>

  <p>"But unfortunately, I don't have them with me." The princess batted her eyes and smiled apologetically.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face fell.</p>

  <p>The relief he felt vanished as quickly as it came.</p>

  <p>"If you don't have the trial tallies, then DIE!" the warrior bellowed. "Kill them!" At the command, the other warriors began to charge at the two.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" the princess cried out, halting the warriors. "I am Pascal's younger sister!"</p>

  <p>When the warrior heard this, he circled the two before landing heavily on the silver boulder. He stared at the princess in astonishment and suspicion, and tilted his head to size her up.</p>

  <p>He scanned her face, carefully looking for a resemblance to Pascal.</p>

  <p>"Evidence."</p>

  <p>"Evidence..." The princess thought for a moment. "My hairpin! The Godly Eagle Horn that my brother obtained in the Collapsing Mountain race is in my hairpin!" she blurted out.</p>

  <p>The warrior bent over and took out the girl's hairpin.</p>

  <p>The pin was multi-colored and when the light hit it in a certain way, the Space Law became faintly discernible. It was clearly a Sumeru Space, but it possessed an Mu Ning that seemed to be even more perfect than the Law Power that Luo Zheng had seen.</p>

  <p>The warrior stretched out his hand and gently flicked it. The hairpin trembled and in his hand, a black eagle horn appeared with a flash of light. He examined it for a moment and said, "It is indeed the one Pascal had hunted. However, you must hand over your trial tallies still."</p>

  <p>The princess smiled coyly. "For my brother's sake, please let us go this time. Or at least, let me ask my people to send the trial tallies here."</p>

  <p>In the past, her brother made an outstanding contribution to the Collapsing Mountain race and received the title "King Warrior," hailing him as a leader of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Hesitation decorated the warrior's face as he turned to talk to the other warriors in their native tongue.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the Collapsing Mountain warrior turned back to Luo Zheng and the princess. "We will give you twenty days. You must produce your trial tallies by then or we will bring hell upon you."</p>

  <p>And with that, he left.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors had quite the temper which made talking to them hard. But now that they were willing to do the princess a favor, it was clear just how important her brother was to them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, one of the Collapsing Mountain members jumped over and grabbed Luo Zheng and the princess. He threw them on his back like two sacks of potatoes and left with the rest.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng left the silver boulder, he quickly regained his freedom and wasn't affected by the attraction force anymore.</p>

  <p>It had been like that from the very beginning. There was an invisible force field that surrounded the area. Anyone who entered would be sucked in but after one managed to leave, they wouldn't be affected anymore.</p>

  <p>This was why the attraction force disappeared as the Collapsing Mountain warriors sped through the air.</p>

  <p>However, as the warriors continued to go deeper, more and more silver boulders appeared. Luo Zheng watched as the boulders transformed into the earth's foundation.</p>

  <p>And with this transformation, the attraction force became greater the deeper they went.</p>

  <p>The two of them could only stare at each other and hold on tighter as the Collapsing Mountain warrior picked up speed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I just remembered," the princess smiled after a while. "I haven't gotten your name yet."</p>

  <p>Deep inside, she felt increasingly uncomfortable as the pull of gravity became heavier. Her position on the Collapsing Mountain warrior's back didn't help too.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo," Luo Zheng answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>This was the first time Luo Zheng visited the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. There was no need to lie about his name.</p>

  <p>"I'm Han Liusu Han," she offered with a little smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was not in the mood to talk. He was too concerned about what they were going to face next.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Han Liusu Han couldn't seem to stop talking. She kept asking him questions such as why he was able to absorb her flames and not get burnt and what universe he came from.</p>

  <p>At her last question, Luo Zheng shook his head. "I don't know which universe it is."</p>

  <p>It was true. Living beings in a certain universe supposedly couldn't leave the universe they were in to go to another universe. That was how it had always been. But this was not applied to mighty warriors.</p>

  <p>"How can that be?" Han Liusu Han frowned. As someone of her status, she was able to see problems within the divine land and it was only natural that she would know much more than Luo Zheng. This time, however, she was the one who was unable to understand what was going on.</p>
