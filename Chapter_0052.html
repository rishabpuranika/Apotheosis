<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 52 The Best Way To Dispense With Fools (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The noble clansmen pupils enjoyed many magic pills, learning the best training skills, and there were even some endowed with excellent bloodlines of the family elders.</p>

  <p>Most of them were born with exceptional advantages over ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Quite a few of them turned into dandies, living a life of extreme depravity due to their special status. Through magic pills, they cultivated smoothly, but they lacked strength and fighting power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not think that all the children of the gentry were like this.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the noble clans in the Imperial Capital wouldn't have thrived for as many years. There must be many children among the nobles, who were gifted, diligent and practiced hard.</p>

  <p>But, obviously, the men he faced now weren't in that league.</p>

  <p>These guys didn't want to work hard nor did they want to kill the beasts, so, instead, they robbed other participants of their crystal fragments. He was indignant that they wanted something for nothing. How could such shameless people exist in the world?</p>

  <p>He watched momentarily, noticing that they were robbing the ordinary disciples, not letting them pass, and yet, the noble disciples were left to pass through without saying a word.</p>

  <p>They were bold enough to rob participants in broad daylight, and the Cloud Sect didn't care?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't actually know if that was true. These guys had been doing this for a while. A few years ago, some disciples from the noble clans discovered this was an ideal location to set up a blockade here, between the second and third level, and collect tolls in the form of crystal fragments from the commoners passing through. It was an easy way to make a fortune, prevent some from gaining admittance and they successfully passed the Blooded Test easily.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Cloud Sect turned a blind eye to their behavior for some reason.</p>

  <p>When the children of the noble clans saw that the Cloud Sect had not punished them, they became more unscrupulous. The experience spread among them for several years. Every Blooded Test since then, there was a group of noble disciples waiting in advance to rob others.</p>

  <p>The number of unreal beasts on the first and second layers wasn't large, and with so many people fighting, many found it impossible to achieve their goals within the given timeframe. So, in order to pass the Blooded Test, many of them were forced to go up the third level.</p>

  <p>Now they faced a new dilemma. Before they reached the third level, they were stripped of their crystal fragments by these despicable disciples.</p>

  <p>Some disciples feared their strength of numbers, while others worried about their influence and high status in the Empire. So, most of them chose to hand over their crystal fragments. Luo Luo Zheng stood to the side for a while, only to see that even a few strong men succumbed to the bullies. They were angry, but seemingly had no choice but to hand over their pieces of crystal fragments helplessly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many watched from a distance with hesitation on their faces.</p>

  <p>They couldn't decide if they should hand over their crystal fragments and head up to the third layer, or back and kill more beasts in the second layer.</p>

  <p>Of course, not all ordinary disciples were willing to be bullied.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng watched from the side, he saw a strong man stride up to pass. The man stood six and a half feet tall, was as strong as an iron tower, and he carried a great sword.</p>

  <p>The men from the noble clans saw him and shouted, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked the towering man as he stared at them fiercely.</p>

  <p>"If you want to pass through this way, you need to leave all your crystal fragment pieces behind!" stated one of the men.</p>

  <p>At this, the towering man looked sullen. Glaring at the group of noble disciples, he asked, "Why should I? What's your reasoning? Does the Cloud Sect sanction robbery in this manner?"</p>

  <p>"Haha, why should you? The reason you should is that we are strong in number and more powerful. If you don't hand over your crystal fragments, you don't pass here," stated another man.</p>

  <p>The towering man was not the sort to give in. His face reddened with anger.</p>

  <p>Unsheathing his great sword strapped to his back, he held it at the ready as he said, "Bah! You want me to hand over my crystal fragments? That's a pipe dream. If you call me Grandpa, I'll consider giving you a reward, my grandchildren, your prize will be, death to anyone who tries to stop me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched from where he stood, not far off with a smile on his face. The towering man was not weak. This group of noble clansmen finally ran into someone too challenging to intimidate.</p>

  <p>The towering man swung his great sword and rushed the pass. He was a burly man with big arms, and as he wielded the great sword, the wind roared, whipping the faces of the noble disciples which caused them discomfort.</p>

  <p>The men from the noble clans were not strong, or they wouldn't be there robbing others.</p>

  <p>In the face of the towering man's attacks, the bullies cursed. Unable to resist his attacks, they fell back to each side of the passage, exposing a gap through the middle.</p>

  <p>Some ordinary disciples who had been hesitant saw the gap and emboldened, took the opportunity to follow the towering man and race through the pass.</p>

  <p>More and more disciples joined the group when they saw the others succeeding.</p>

  <p>The checkpoint of the noble clansmen was collapsed. The ordinary disciples hurried as a mob at the pass, like fish released from the floodgate. Luo Luo Zheng followed the crowd, speeding forward.</p>

  <p>Seeing what was occurring, the noble clansmen's faces were filled with anger. They didn't expect this at all. They didn't expect to let one man through, let alone so many people along with him.</p>
