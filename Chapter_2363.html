<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>After a few scattered bird songs, a group of colorful clouds made entirely of the mysterious birds descended slowly.</p>

  <p>The members of the Swallow race also brought several children to worship the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Although the Swallow race wasn't openly at war with the Eagle race, the two races were not on friendly terms with each other in this world. Thus, the members of the Swallow race present exchanged no greetings or niceties with the members of the Eagle race. Rather, the two races simply looked upon each other coldly from afar, huddling together with their own peers.</p>

  <p>When the three consummate True Gods from the Swallow race noticed Zheng and Nelly, they were surprised.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you from the Mu Clan? Why are you here?" The one who had spoken was a young man with dark skin. His name was Eugene, and he came from the Mysterious Soul Building, one of the three forces of the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan and the Mu Clan were not on the same side. Hearing this, Nelly was taken aback. She nodded fiercely. "If you can come here, so can we!"</p>

  <p>Eugene rolled his eyes and smiled coldly. "You are just a low-rank True God. How dare you run around this world?" he said in a condescending tone. "It's really unexpected that you were even able to find the Heavenly Wheel Temple!"</p>

  <p>Nelly didn't say anything. Frankly, she didn't even care much about controlling the jade seal. She was too busy thinking about how to prevent these children from being eaten by the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Zheng also remained silent. These consummate True Gods had found this place through the Swallow race. It seemed that his judgment had been right.</p>

  <p>The key to the jade seal was probably inside the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>After a while, a peculiar sound, loud and clear, came down from the sky again.</p>

  <p>"Yo..."</p>

  <p>Then a golden cloud of birds shot across the sky.</p>

  <p>It was a group of golden rocs!</p>

  <p>In a heartbeat, the cloud of rocs swooped downward and landed on the other side of the altar.</p>

  <p>The Swallow race had been successful at avoiding conflicts with both the Eagle race and the Roc race over the past years. Thus, even though they were far from being allies, the Swallow race did not consider either of the two other races to be their mortal enemies.</p>

  <p>However, there had been a feud between the Roc race and the Eagle race for many generations.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, the Myth Tribe of the Eagle race had sent out eight Royal Eagles and over a hundred fierce male eagles to massacre a small village belonging to the Roc race.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Roc race retaliated, ruthlessly slaughtering many members of the Eagle race themselves.</p>

  <p>Zheng himself had witnessed the golden rocs attacking the cloaked men who raised eagles. That, too, was part of the Roc race's revenge against the Eagle race.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that the two races regarded each other with such anger.</p>

  <p>They were, to all intents and purposes, enemies.</p>

  <p>Upon landing, the large golden rocs acknowledged the eagles on Zheng's side with an angry, hair-raising shriek.</p>

  <p>"Yo..."</p>

  <p>"Yo..."</p>

  <p>Despite this rude greeting, evidently meant as a provocation, the Royal Eagles of the Eagle race showed no weakness.</p>

  <p>"Aoo...</p>

  <p>Aoo..."</p>

  <p>The Royal Eagles responded with high pitched whistling.</p>

  <p>With the birds jeering and shouting at each other, the sleeping children were woken by the commotion. They all opened their mouths and cried loudly, adding to the ruckus.</p>

  <p>"Hey, little guy, don't cry," cooed Nelly, throwing the golden rocs an angry look, as the little boy in her arms wailed loudly.</p>

  <p>Despite the racket, the members of both the Eagle and the Roc race still kept their resentment under control, refusing to resort to physical violence.</p>

  <p>After all, this was the territory of the Heavenly Wheel Snake. Whoever offended it would be punished.</p>

  <p>Then, several other figures were seen jumping down from the backs of the golden rocs.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the person in front, his eyes widened. "Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, Nelly, who remained beside Zheng, lit up with joy at the sight of her sister. "Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle didn't notice Nelly at first. She didn't even know that her sister, too, had jumped in. In her eyes, these aboriginals were as inconsequential as a colony of ants.</p>

  <p>After she had entered this world with Walton, Shahn and the others, she quickly found the crux of the matter, coming to the same conclusion as Zheng. If she wanted to control the jade seal, she had to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods had also figured this out by then.</p>

  <p>However, even though they had found the Heavenly Wheel Temple, they were unable to enter. Two of the consummate True Gods had already paid a heavy price for that, and even Troy had been seriously injured.</p>

  <p>They had no choice but to look for other methods.</p>

  <p>After exploring this world, they joined the Roc race.</p>

  <p>Of course, since the consummate True Gods possessed extreme strength, the way they went about joining the Roc race was different from Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Even if the consummate True Gods couldn't use their internal momentum, people from the Roc race would never be able to defeat them. Thus, they had no choice but to allow the consummate True Gods to join them.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a few days along with the members of the Roc race, they finally got the chance to worship. Now, having arrived at the Heavenly Wheel Temple, they stood waiting for the Heavenly Wheel Snake to appear. Rachelle had never thought that she would see her sister here.</p>

  <p>"Nelly! Why are you here?" Rachelle asked, her expression full of shock and confusion.</p>

  <p>As soon as she had finished speaking, she noticed that Zheng was standing beside Nelly. A trace of blood flashed across her sharp eyes, and a sneer appeared at the corners of her mouth. "How dare you enter this place to seek death? Let's see who can protect you today!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, she transformed into a ray of blood-red light and charged straight at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was very determined to kill Zheng. As long as she believed she had a chance, she would take action without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Troy had stood in front of Zheng, and she knew she could not fight him.</p>

  <p>However, Troy wasn't here now. Having joined hands with others in order to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple, he was seriously injured, and was now healing himself in the tribe of the Roc race. And Rachelle was convinced that the rest of the consummate True Gods did not dare attempt to stop her.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Rachelle charging at Zheng, Nelly became very anxious. She gently put the boy in her arms on the ground. She was going to try to stop Rachelle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng's figure suddenly flashed, and he quickly retreated. With a single thought, he made the Redemption Armor spread out completely, turning into a thin film that covered his entire body.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, his body began to accumulate power.</p>

  <p>Zheng had predicted that the other consummate True Gods, including Rachelle, would go there.</p>

  <p>If Troy was there, Rachelle never dared to attack so impulsively. After all, Troy had warned her in advance.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had been unaware that Troy had gotten so seriously injured, and thus rendered unable to go there along with Rachelle and the other consummate True Gods this time.</p>

  <p>'I am in trouble this time!' Zheng gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>Although he was retreating extremely fast, the blood light from Rachelle was even faster. In almost an instant, it had closed the distance between itself and Zheng. It turned into sharp talon that clawed at him.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A shrill voice rang through the surrounding space.</p>

  <p>If Zheng let Rachelle grab him like that in the divine land, he would have his body smashed to pieces!</p>

  <p>Within the divine land, a low-rank True God could not withstand the attack of a consummate True God. Even if Zheng made use of his physical body and the Redemption Armor, he would still fail to resist and succumb to the attack when in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, in this world, none of the Godly Ways existed, and it was impossible for anyone to use the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Of course, Rachelle's most powerful Murdering Godly Way couldn't be condensed in this world either. She had simply extracted the power of the nine stars from her body and emitted a strong power. It was difficult for this power to penetrate through the Redemption Armor, and even if it succeeded, it would become much weaker in the process. Zheng was already able to withstand it with just his own physical body!</p>

  <p>When she noticed the strange thin film on Zheng's body, a strange expression colored Rachelle's face. She stretched out her hands, a short sword and a short machete appearing on each of her hands. Then she said coldly, "Even though you have the magical treasure, I still can cut you into pieces!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she had finished speaking, she took a step forward and charged towards Zheng at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng retreated immediately, looking calm.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was not as intimidating without the help of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Indeed, she far surpassed Zheng in terms of speed, but as far as physical strength was concerned, Zheng was not much less powerful than her.</p>

  <p>"In that case..."</p>

  <p>In a flash, the Great Weighty Sword appeared in Zheng's hand. However, just as he was about to attack, an unknown figure flew past him unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been going around in a wide circle as he continuously dodged Rachelle. Nelly had taken the shortcut and caught up with Rachelle, placing herself between her sister and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>As Nelly went to stop her sister, Rachelle looked livid. She didn't even think she recognized her sister any more.</p>

  <p>However, Rachelle was so eager to kill Zheng that she chose to simply ignore Nelly.</p>

  <p>With a single move, she pushed Nelly out of the way and onto the ground.</p>

  <p>As she pushed Nelly away, she was faced with a surprise. Something in front of her suddenly roared.</p>

  <p>Not only had Zheng not run away, but he stood there, both of his hands on his heavy sword, aiming to swing it at her head.</p>
