<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2706 Detoxification Method </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng mentioning the detoxification method, the poisonous people were shocked.</p>

  <p>Their resentment for Lathrop temporarily blinded them to their own problems, and they had forgotten that they had been turned into poisonous people by him.</p>

  <p>However, they were not worried about the toxins in their bodies, at least not yet.</p>

  <p>They had suffered burns and erosion on their skin from contact with the Phoenix Crown Blood, some worse than others, but the toxins in their bodies were easy to remove.</p>

  <p>However, the Phoenix Crown Blood had entered their elixir fields along their meridians and begun to invade their inner worlds. This was the most pressing issue.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Detoxification!"</p>

  <p>"My inner world is about to collapse!"</p>

  <p>"We can't kill him. Our life depends on him; only he can reverse what he has done. Ask him to give us some antidotes..."</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods' desire to live was still strong.</p>

  <p>If they were rendered unable to cultivate anymore, the only solution would likely be to give up their elixir fields.</p>

  <p>This, however, was the last resort, as without their ability to cultivate, their cultivation base would be completely lost, and they would be completely useless in the divine land. It was a fate worse than death for some.</p>

  <p>Now Lathrop's face was bloodless, pale as untrodden snow.</p>

  <p>After he had lost his elixir field, he couldn't even explode the inner world in his body to commit suicide.</p>

  <p>No matter what, he was doomed to die. How he wished to end it quickly!</p>

  <p>He didn't want his soul to be tortured and used for the benefit of his enemies, who might use the soul-searching method to extract information from him.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he raised his head, unbuttoned the space ring, and threw it at Luo Zheng. Hoarsely, he addressed Luo Zheng. His strength was dwindling.</p>

  <p>"Phoenix Crown Blood can be forced out of the body through the cultivation of the Energy-gathering Poison Skill," he said. "It's inside this space ring."</p>

  <p>As he threw the ring, Lathrop wiped out the soul mark engraved in it.</p>

  <p>The ring glowed with a red light, and suddenly, an ornately decorated booklet appeared in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Luo Zheng opened the booklet and leafed through a few pages. Then, he nodded, and his furrowed brow became smooth. Now he knew that the Energy-gathering Poison Skill was a kind of reverse poison cultivation method, used to detoxify the True Gods who had practiced poison skills and become contaminated as a result.</p>

  <p>Then, Lathrop's expression suddenly changed. Indeed, an idea had just come to the surface of the tumultuous sea of thoughts in his mind.</p>

  <p>Less than a second later, an intense soul pressure came from the space ring in Luo Zheng's hand and rushed directly towards Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Lathrop's eyes suddenly glazed over, as if he had entered a trance.</p>

  <p>He had given up his own body and flown away as a disembodied soul.</p>

  <p>He hadn't played any tricks using the Energy-gathering Poison Skill.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was busy examining whether the booklet was real or not, Lathrop had activated an offensive soul weapon in his own space ring.</p>

  <p>After all, Lathrop was a consummate True God who cultivated the Great Dominance Technique. In terms of strength, many of the other consummate True Gods were superior to him, but his advantage was his soul, strong as a soul could be. Using a soul weapon to shake Luo Zheng's mind had been his only chance to escape!</p>

  <p>Although he was now a mere soul, he had the ability to occupy a body shell. As long as he managed to stay alive in the divine land, he would still have a chance to become whole again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was coming back to his senses. This was testament to how much he stood out from his lot. If any of the other consummate True Gods had been attacked by a soul weapon, they wouldn't have been able to come to their sense in such a short time.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng's soul was even stronger than that of many Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The powerful soul fluctuation had hit Luo Zheng's own soul, making him a little confused, but the effect was not much worse than that of a mild concussion.</p>

  <p>In less than two seconds, Luo Zheng's eyes regained their vision, sharp as ever.</p>

  <p>He raised his head and his eyes followed the path along which Lathrop's soul had fled. His eyes narrowed slightly, and a faint golden light appeared on the surface of his own soul.</p>

  <p>Then, extremely cold soul pressure burst violently out from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of soul arrows were all of a sudden tearing through the sky at lightning speed, all aiming at Lathrop's soul. Before anyone could blink, his soul was torn to pieces by the countless soul arrows.</p>

  <p>The poisonous people, the Mo Clan and the Cyan Tree Clan could not see this with their eyes, but they could feel the immense soul pressure spreading through the sky with their spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>The soul pressure emitted an extremely sharp intent. Even if they used their spiritual sense to detect it, their scalps would still go numb with terror.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Lathrop suffered an unenviable fate.</p>

  <p>The members of the Cyan Tree Clan and the poisonous people were not so easy to scare, but Hallam and the True Gods of the Mo Clan felt a chill creep up their spines.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was proving himself to be virtually invincible. The Mo Clan members weren't sure whether they should stay or leave. They stood rooted to the spot, afraid that if they moved a muscle, this formidable young man would kill them. All the while the Mo Clan members trembled in fear, their leader was pondering an excuse to somehow disassociate himself from Lathrop.</p>

  <p>Having killed Lathrop, Luo Zheng now returned to Lucille and threw the booklet to her.</p>

  <p>The other poisonous True Gods followed the exchange closely.</p>

  <p>Feeling their eyes on them, Luo Zheng smiled nonchalantly. "Give them a copy of this cultivation method. I think they really want it," he said with a wink.</p>

  <p>"Alright," she said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng noticed something stir in his peripheral vision. Turning, he saw the old man of the Cyan Tree Clan leading his clansmen out of the forest and heading straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your help," said the old man with gratitude.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't planned to make a move," Luo Zheng answered politely. "It's just that the guy was trying to kill my friend."</p>

  <p>He glanced anxiously at Lucille.</p>

  <p>The divine land wasn't the same as the Evolutionary Universe after all.</p>

  <p>Those Godly Geniuses couldn't be lucky forever. At some point, their luck would run cold and they would perish. Luo Zheng wondered how the other Godly Geniuses were now.</p>

  <p>"Even so, meeting you has been the best thing that happened to our clan in ages," the old man said reverently. As he spoke, he took out a small jade box. Opening it carefully, he revealed an emerald-colored pill within. "I can see that your friend has been gravely poisoned. This pill is made from the internal momentum of Life Divine Dao, and it takes an entire divine era to make just one such pill. It's the most precious treasure of our Cyan Tree Clan, and I want your friend to have it. Once you swallow it, you can get a new body and expel all poison. Please accept this humble gift to you," added the old man, and bowed his head as he extended the box to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Examining the emerald green pill for just a moment, Luo Zheng could tell it was authentic. It indeed contained a significant amount of extremely pure Life Law.</p>

  <p>After taking over the pill, Luo Zheng threw it to Lucille.</p>

  <p>Then he turned his head and looked at Hallam who was on the hillside.</p>

  <p>He said coldly, "I didn't want to participate in the disputes between the Mo clan and the Cyan Tree Clan, but that guy you hired tried to destroy my friend. It's a bad luck for your clan. The Mo Clan should move out of the Wind Wood Region from now on!"</p>

  <p>A second-tier clan often occupied several divine cities and had a deep foundation in a region.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng was asking the Mo Clan to move.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, Hallam could only feel bitterness in his mouth.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, Luo Zheng was not a bloodthirsty person. Many other consummate True Gods would have chosen to kill Hallam if they had been in Luo Zheng's shoes.</p>

  <p>Though reluctant and resentful, Hallam immediately consented. "Lathrop made poisonous people. He deserved his fate," he said, his throat tight.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you have rid this place of a villain. The Mo clan was blind and foolish to have associated with someone like him. We deserve the punishment and will move out of the Wind Wood Region immediately as you command."</p>

  <p>Having concluded his thoughts, Hallam didn't dare to linger any longer.</p>

  <p>He turned and left, his people following close in his wake.</p>
