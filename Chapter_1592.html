<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1592 The Warriors In The Darkness </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>That human warrior called Cain had been hooked and was immediately dragged off into the enveloping darkness. No sign of him could be seen, not even a shadow in the murky darkness.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Cain shouted desperately, but then his shouting abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw a mass of yellow light dots suddenly burst out from the darkness on the other side of the deep ditch...</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Cain had died. Half of his Illusion Points had burst forth from his body!</p>

  <p>The moment those Illusion Points appeared, he disappeared, as if he was immediately consumed by the darkness!</p>

  <p>"Where are the Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that they have already been absorbed!"</p>

  <p>"This is impossible!" Janet's face revealed an expression of surprise and horror. "In this Hall of Causality, is there a warrior of some kind that could have killed Cain and absorbed the Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, only warriors could absorb Illusion Points from each other. The wild animals and dreaded beasts could kill the warriors, but couldn't absorb their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng killed Cain, then no matter how far away they were from each other, Cain's Illusion Points would fly towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lucille had once given her subordinates the golden suicide pellets that could take their lives. These golden pellets had contained Lucille's consciousness within them though. As a result, when her subordinates committed suicide, it was as if Lucille had killed them in the Illusion Battlefield. So she had obtained their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Some warriors who were killed by vicious beasts in the secret lands or out in the wilderness would have their Illusion Points float on the spot and become Illusion Points belonging to no one. Any warrior who found these points could absorb them, but those vicious beasts could never absorb the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>However, after Cain was dragged away and slain, his Illusion Points were almost instantly absorbed.</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility; there were warriors hiding on the other side of ravine.</p>

  <p>These warriors on the other side had hooked Cain and dragged him away, after which they killed him and absorbed his Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Every time the Hall of Causality opened, only ten warriors could enter at the same time. How then were there warriors on the other side of the ditch?</p>

  <p>It didn't make any sense at all...</p>

  <p>"Be careful." Luo Zheng also frowned. The hook in his hand was tightly held in his grip, while his eyes turned a motley green. Even though he had activated his magical eyes, he was still unable to see into the darkness. It seemed that someone had made use of the Dark Law to create the darkness, and it was as if the darkness was a curtain that protected and hid the warriors within it.</p>

  <p>"It's the power of the Dark Law, and those opponents have made full preparation this time," Jeffrey said coldly. He held a hook in one hand and the Buddha Curse Blade in the other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept glancing around the darkness, and he finally tracked down one of the blurry shadows.</p>

  <p>When they had stepped into this hall, the hooks were neatly arranged to the side, and there were enough for all of the warriors. The purpose was obvious.</p>

  <p>Since the warriors on the other side of the deep ditch could hook them over, Luo Zheng could respond in kind...</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>After aiming at the target, Luo Zheng hurled the hook forward and it flew straight towards the other side!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>Although, the moving speed of the hook was extremely high, the 'creatures' on the other side seemed to be highly experienced. Thus, they continuously moved around the edge of the deep ditch making it difficult to target them.</p>

  <p>"None of them has been hooked!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he reached out with a tug and pulled his hook back from the other side.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was retrieving his hook, his eyebrows raised. "Be careful!</p>

  <p>Hailey..."</p>

  <p>However, it was already too late. He had barely spoken his warning, when another hook came hurtling out of the darkness. It quickly latched onto Hailey and pulled her towards the other side of the deep ditch.</p>

  <p>Actually, when Cain had been hooked earlier, Luo Zheng had noticed that the hook itself wasn't able to directly injure anyone. But once it caught someone, it seemed to create an irresistible force and instantly wrapped around the warrior, pulling him towards the other side.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Hailey had been hooked and was about to be pulled into the darkness, a determined glint flashed in Zheng's eyes. The hook that he had just withdrawn once again shot towards the other side!</p>

  <p>"Swish..."</p>

  <p>This time, he didn't try to catch any of the shadows in the darkness, but he instead let the hook fly towards Hailey and hooked her.</p>

  <p>As Hailey entered into the darkness, she felt a strong threat and prepared to counterattack. But at that moment, another hook wrapped around her body, pulling her back...</p>

  <p>"That was close!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Hailey was fine, Janet and the others let out a combined sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. Those guys on the other side of the ditch are hiding in the darkness, so how can we attack and defeat them? It's not fair at all!" the ogre warrior coldly muttered, raising the hook in his hand and glaring across to the other side of the ditch.</p>

  <p>Hailey had been careless earlier and had been caught by the warriors on the other side. At this moment, she felt lucky that she had escaped.</p>

  <p>After Hailey was pulled back to safety by Luo Zheng, she nodded slightly in thanks at him. Then, an angry expression appeared on her delicate face, and she glared at the shadows in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"There are indeed strange warriors on the other side!"</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, she suddenly took out the Moon Bursting Flame Bow. She wildly drew out the life vitality from within her body, and a vortex of silver flames appeared in front of her. She was ready to launch her fiercest counterattack!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>As Hailey condensed the vortex of flame, another hook shot toward her from the darkness.</p>

  <p>After being hooked once, Hailey naturally wouldn't let this happen a second time. Grabbing the Moon Bursting Flame Bow, she coldly snorted in contempt. With a twist of her body, she swayed aside slightly, while she also began to release the bowstring from between her fingers!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The wildly rolling vortex of flame shot directly towards the other side of the deep ditch.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene, Luo Zheng, Jeffrey, Janet, and the others also fixed their gazes on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>If the flames that Hailey had fired were to explode on the other side, they might be able to see and locate their opponents, thereby obtaining a victory.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The fierce silver flames from the vortex clearly illuminated the other side of the deep ditch, displaying their enemy in a bright silver light which cast ghoulish shadows behind them.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng and the others finally saw with clarity that there were ten warriors standing on the other side. Each of them was holding a hook in their hands as they gazed at Luo Zheng and the others with unkind smiles plastered on their faces.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the flame arrow that Hailey had shot was great, it seemed to be unable to fully display its power in the darkness, where Dark Law dominated. While being devoured by the Dark Law, the vortex of silver flames flickered and began to rapidly shrink...</p>

  <p>The warriors stood in the middle of the opposite bank, namely the leader, pointed at Luo Zheng with a contemptuous smile on his leering face. At the same time, the warrior put his hand on his neck in a throat cutting gesture. When he had finished, the vortex of flame was completely engulfed and snuffed out by shadows. The ten warriors on the other side once again immersed themselves in the darkness. They were protected by the concealing dark.</p>

  <p>"There are ten warriors in that group! Their strength must be great indeed!" Janet said seriously.</p>

  <p>According to Janet's speculation, the ten warriors on the other side could also be warriors that were currently contesting in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>However, to everyone's surprise, this Hall of Causality was actually letting two groups of warriors stay opposite each other!</p>

  <p>These ten warriors on the other side might also have passed through two Halls of Causality as well, but not a single one of them had died, as they still retained their original number of ten. The strength of these warriors could definitely not then be underestimated.</p>

  <p>What was even worse was that they had even set up the Dark Law in advance, hiding themselves within the darkness before their attack, which had made Luo Zheng and his group members less able to fend them off.</p>

  <p>"Who can perform the Dark Law?" Janet asked. The Dark Law was a rather unpopular law, and Janet hadn't mastered it.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had once received the baptism by laws, he had never comprehended nor favored the Dark Law.</p>

  <p>Hearing Janet's question, Jeffrey laughed coldly and responded, "We don't need the Dark Law! Look at me!"</p>

  <p>Jeffrey clapped his hands together gently, and the Buddhist sound began to ring out, making the air quiver and filled with mist.</p>

  <p>A hallucinatory glow began emitting from his body, spreading in all directions...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others who were standing in the mist were unable to sense anything strange.</p>

  <p>However, to the warriors on the other side of the ditch, there appeared to be countless figures who were made out of thin air. Jeffrey had conjured a mass of additional illusion figures that mixed with the group of seven warriors. It was difficult to tell which figure was real or not. Now the enemy could not spot their targets so easily.</p>

  <p>"I want to see how they hook us this time!" Jeffrey sneered.</p>

  <p>Although the mist was unable to completely cover the seven of them, it could still cause quite a bit of interference to confound their opponents.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the two groups of warriors had to fight a battle in this third Hall of Causality, in addition to any other challenges that might still be waiting.</p>

  <p>In this mist, the warriors began to plan how to counterattack.</p>
