<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist was thrown out of the red circle and he fell heavily onto the ground.</p>

  <p>His was in a much better state compared to other martial artists who were hurt or even heavily injured. The fall couldn't hurt someone like him, especially at his level.</p>

  <p>But the embarrassment was too much.</p>

  <p>He would rather be injured and carried out than be chucked out like this.</p>

  <p>It was truly a great humiliation for him.</p>

  <p>However, he quickly regained composure when he got up.</p>

  <p>Martial artists in the divine kingdoms knew much more than those in the Central Region and the Sea God Continent. He knew that Luo Zheng's speed was truly extraordinary. The distance, angle and timing were all perfect!</p>

  <p>He had summoned all his strength to prepare his attack on Luo Luo Zheng. That was why he hadn't been able to react quickly and had allowed Luo Luo Zheng to get so close to him.</p>

  <p>There was only one explanation why Luo Luo Zheng could make such a judgment.</p>

  <p>He was quick to react and his judgment was accurate. He had fought in countless battles, so he had this kind of fighting instinct. Such a fellow was undoubtedly terrifying.</p>

  <p>Keeping this in mind, the martial artist took a deep breath and observed Luo Luo Zheng carefully. However, there was no hatred in his eyes, only reverence and fear. Those who had personally experienced Luo Zheng's wrath could understand how terrifying it was.</p>

  <p>Everyone was also quite shocked.</p>

  <p>Although the martial artist was embarrassed to be forcefully thrown out by Luo Luo Zheng, as a third-tier member, he was powerful beyond doubt. None of the people present had the guts to mock him.</p>

  <p>Most people were just surprised that he was thrown out. They didn't see how Luo Luo Zheng had done it. He was simply too fast.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the three powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm wore serious expressions.</p>

  <p>"I have underestimated this guy. Given his strength, he definitely isn't just a third-tier member!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he has the strength to reach the second tier!"</p>

  <p>"If I'm not wrong, he just used the forceful energy. Has he cultivated both body and life vitality?"</p>

  <p>It was rare to come across warriors who cultivated both body and life vitality anywhere. The Sea God Continent, the Central Region and divine kingdoms were no exception.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just wanted to end the battle quickly. If it dragged on, he would have to reveal more trump cards. And he wanted to keep them hidden for as long as possible. Therefore, he chose to directly use his forceful energy.</p>

  <p>The three powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were shocked when they saw this.</p>

  <p>Gregory, Randy, the crown prince, and Edwin, who formed the first tier, were the inheritors of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. It was likely that they would inherit the legacy of the kingdom.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was very difficult for an ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist to be included in the first tier even if they were extremely powerful. The characters in the first tier were the best martial artists with supreme strength among divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>This was the strength of the four divine kingdoms. They never lacked divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>Now that the world of chaos had begun, there were more and more super talents in the current era.</p>

  <p>Back in the day, it was an extraordinary feat for a divine kingdom to have ten to fifteen divine-level talents. If properly nurtured, these divine-level talents would definitely step into the Soul Sea Realm in the future.</p>

  <p>However, in the last few decades, the world of chaos had begun and subsequently, divine-level talents had begun to appear in large numbers.</p>

  <p>In just a few years, there were over a hundred divine-level talents already in the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The four members of the first tier were able to defeat all other divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>But they felt that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't qualified to be counted among them.</p>

  <p>However, the strength he had displayed was enough for him to stand at the top of the second tier. Now they had a completely different impression of him.</p>

  <p>It was not that easy to join the second tier, but Luo Luo Zheng had managed to reach the top of the second tier.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Divine Kingdom had countless large and small martial houses, and ninety percent of the talents were in two major martial houses, the Jade Martial House and the Dark Martial House. They were highly gifted. Their achievements today were the combined result of resources and careful cultivation.</p>

  <p>Tianxing was an independent warrior. No one knew where he cultivated.</p>

  <p>How could his resources be compared to the Harlen Divine Kingdom's?</p>

  <p>He had just appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Among independent warriors too, there were some who were more impressive than others. However, Luo Luo Zheng was better than all of them.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled faintly as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng. He then said in a low voice, "It is not enough. This is not your full strength. Let me see your full strength!"</p>

  <p>With everyone's eyes on him, Luo Luo Zheng sighed to himself thinking how naive he was. The vision and strength of martial artists in divine kingdoms were beyond his expectations. If he wanted to pass the examination, he would have to show his strength.</p>

  <p>There would probably be more trouble.</p>

  <p>He hadn't forgotten that Randy had once said that he was the only one who could pass this examination.</p>

  <p>As predicted by Luo Luo Zheng, one of the other two warriors had won. The loser was driven out of the shrinking red circle.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, the result should have been announced by now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Randy, and another martial artist had passed the examination.</p>

  <p>However, Randy looked back at the three mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm and winked at them, so they didn't announce the result.</p>

  <p>They knew Randy had interest in Luo Luo Zheng and wanted to test his strength thoroughly.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Token was a hard-earned badge for martial artists, but it wouldn't be difficult for Randy to obtain one given his status and strength. Even if Luo Luo Zheng were to be eliminated, it shouldn't be too difficult for him to obtain a token as Randy had showed interest in him.</p>

  <p>Since that was the case, they wanted to see Luo Zheng's true strength.</p>

  <p>Randy laughed. "As I said, only I can pass this round. Would the two of you like me to send you out of the circle, or would you like to leave by yourselves?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was calm as he had long predicted that this would happen. He couldn't avoid a fight with Randy at this point.</p>

  <p>The other martial artist became even more depressed. A trace of anger could be seen on his face. 'Lord Randy has gone too far in bullying us, ' he thought. 'I have gone all out to pass the examination, but now, he wants to break the rules and kick me out.' He seethed inwardly.</p>

  <p>There wasn't much time left. From the moment the red circle began to shrink, only 300 seconds were left. The confrontation and Randy's talk had taken 135 seconds.</p>

  <p>"I have already passed the examination. Why are you?" The martial artist protested. He was unwilling to accept this, but more than that he was unwilling to fight Randy. All he could do was to argue with him.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" yelled Randy. "I don't want to repeat my words a second time."</p>

  <p>He stood in the center of the red circle, while Luo Luo Zheng and the warrior stood on either side of him. As the red circle continued to shrink, the two had to move closer to him.</p>

  <p>As the martial artist saw the distance between him and Randy closing in, he clenched his teeth and began to sweat profusely. Clearly, he was not convinced. However, looking at Randy who stood not far away, he knew that he was no match for him. If he fought the Lord, he would be humiliated and seriously injured. What was worse, there would be more unforeseen trouble.</p>

  <p>Finally, he gritted his teeth and stood still. The red circle kept shrinking and moved past his feet.</p>

  <p>He was eliminated.</p>

  <p>Many warriors looked at him with pity in their eyes.</p>

  <p>This was a tough examination and the probability of passing it was low as ninety percent of the participants were eliminated.</p>

  <p>This martial artist had passed the examination, and yet he was forced by Randy to quit the game. What a shame!</p>
