<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Livid, Leyton wordlessly stared at the corpse of the female patriarch of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>With a sneer showing on his expressionless face, Zavier commented dryly,</p>

  <p>"Huh. Her method of committing suicide is pretty unique."</p>

  <p>Hamish said in all seriousness, "The matriarch has taken her own life, which is equivalent to stopping suppressing the will of the divine land. It seems like she already knew who the successor is!"</p>

  <p>The Time Sea and the Time Sea Forbidden Land existed for one reason: to hinder the awakening of the divine land's will.</p>

  <p>Chiyou provided the Nine Li race with a ship, the divine land, for them to escape, but they would have been in trouble if the divine land's will had awakened.</p>

  <p>The will of a world was usually volatile. All would be well if the will was kind; otherwise, if the will was evil and violent, it could easily kill all the creatures in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The mission of the female patriarch of the Sun Blind race was to suppress the divine land's will and keep it in its initial state.</p>

  <p>Back then, Nicholas and Hamish had every intention of killing and replacing the female patriarch.</p>

  <p>However, the idea was rejected by Leyton.</p>

  <p>Leyton was afraid that after the female patriarch's demise, the original will of the divine land would be liberated and have its won consciousness and conscience. By then, the divine land would no longer be under their control.</p>

  <p>Given that the Yellow Emperor Guards were stronger than the natives of the divine land, they were very likely to become the first targets of the will.</p>

  <p>Based on the same reasoning, the matriarch had actively been suppressing the original will of the divine land, while selecting her own target in the process.</p>

  <p>In the Time Sea, the members of the Sun Blind race had previously attempted to verify Zheng's abilities and potential, but the results they had gathered were inconclusive.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Zheng seized the Time Jade Seal from many Holy Beings. Only then did the matriarch realize Zheng's massive potential. Even then, she continued observing Zheng's progress.</p>

  <p>This time, the Mountain of Holy Beings was opened in advance, and the matriarch could finally verify this fact.</p>

  <p>At that moment, she knew that her mission was over.</p>

  <p>She was even surer that the Yellow Emperor Guards would not just stand by and would definitely attempt to stop her.</p>

  <p>So, the matriarch took the most sensible method, which was to kill herself.</p>

  <p>As a security measure, she even used the power of the Time Sword of Gods to commit suicide.</p>

  <p>Lorcan walked over and picked up the crystals scattered on the ground. He shook his head slightly and said, "This treasure is of no value after it breaks..."</p>

  <p>"This sword is not important. What really matters is who is her successor."</p>

  <p>Leyton wondered aloud, his eyes trained on the three Sun Blind warriors.</p>

  <p>Feeling Leyton's chilly regard, the three warriors trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"I am giving you nine seconds. Say it, or the entire Sun Blind race will die with you," Leyton said calmly.</p>

  <p>To the Yellow Emperor Guards, the Sun Blind race's members were as inconsequential as ants. Besides, they knew various ways of extracting information from their targets by sifting through their memories.</p>

  <p>"It's  Zheng Luo!" the Sun Blind warrior in the lead cried out without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Before she died, the matriarch did not make them promise to keep the successor's identity a secret; naturally, they were now under no obligation to do so.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo?" Leyton was a little confused.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Lorena's son," Hamish uttered, not surprised to hear the answer. "He brought those Nine Li Guards to the divine land." Zheng was the son of Lorena after all, so it made sense for him to assume control of the divine land. Hamish only wondered why the incident happened so suddenly and without a warning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, him," said Leyton, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that too easy?" Zavier commented gleefully. "Those critters have been hiding in the forbidden area. All we need to do is to smoke them out and get rid of them!" Touching his nose, he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"But it's not that easy to enter the forbidden area," Hamish warned.</p>

  <p>Salim, who was silent most of the time, squinted his eyes and commented,</p>

  <p>"In the past, we have opened and broken into a forbidden area. Although it was a bit troublesome, nobody could stop us!"</p>

  <p>Several years after the divine land was opened, several Yellow Emperor Guards stormed in and attacked. At that time, many members of the Nine Li race elected to hide in the forbidden area, because powerful restrictions were in place within the forbidden area to deter outsiders.</p>

  <p>However, with their combined forces, the Yellow Emperor Guards managed to tear open the forbidden area and kill many members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"The area was only a second-level forbidden area at that time, and the divine land has evolved since then. These days, the forbidden areas are nothing like what they used to be," retorted Hamish.</p>

  <p>"Hamish," Leyton replied, "what you said is reasonable, but we must do it!</p>

  <p>Don't forget that there is still someone who can help us!"</p>

  <p>At that time, the Yellow Emperor Guards stepped into the divine land and became the mortal enemies of its people.</p>

  <p>The current situation in the divine land was completely different. The Yellow Emperor Guards even controlled the Hall of Holy Beings, and there were so many Holy Beings that they could make use of.</p>

  <p>"Lorcan, Salim, go and find Samuel as soon as possible. I want to see Zheng's corpse before the Mountain of Holy Beings opens," ordered Leyton expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>"What about me?" Zavier asked.</p>

  <p>"Continue to collect blood for the Sea Cracking Skull," Leyton said.</p>

  <p>Every single time, Zavier's mission ended up being the most complicated and the most difficult, but he did not dare to disobey Leyton. He only asked unhappily, "What about Hamish?"</p>

  <p>"He still needs to search for the other Yellow Emperor Guards in the chaos."</p>

  <p>The most pressing problem of the Yellow Emperor Guards was not Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the Holy Beings and True Gods were nothing to be afraid of, and they would eliminate them sooner or later. They only needed to focus on the Other Shore Realm warriors outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the Mountain of Holy Beings had appeared ahead of time, which drew Leyton's focus back. He realized that the creatures hiding in the forbidden area might ruin their plans.</p>

  <p>On the second day after the mountain's appearance, many Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods gathered from all directions.</p>

  <p>However, after its appearance, the Mountain of Holy Beings did not open at once. It would still take a long time to open, but most warriors camped at the foot of the Mountain of Holy Beings in advance.</p>

  <p>"Why did the Mountain of Holy Beings emerge two years in advance?" a woman inquired.</p>

  <p>This woman was a consummate True God who led the Wen Clan in a northern region of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Anyway, I've been waiting for this day for years! This time, I'm going to lead the Huang Clan to the Time Sea and own a Floating Island there after I become a Holy Being!" another man said with a fierce, determined expression on his face. He was the grand elder of the Huang Clan in a northwest region of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Haha." A scholar-like man dressed in a long robe jeered, "Only three warriors at most are qualified to become Holy Beings when the Mountain of Holy Beings appears each time. Sometimes, only one warrior is given the title. I'm afraid you might even be disqualified to fight." To add insult to injury, he made a small salute toward the man, who harrumphed in displeasure. "If you're that leery of my strength, maybe we can fight now..."</p>

  <p>When these people were gathered together, all kinds of exchanges and arguments were inevitable.</p>

  <p>Leland stayed at the edge of the crowd, staring blankly at the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>He was not counted among the top Demi-holy Beings, and it was extremely difficult for him to become a Holy Being. Even so, he would not give up this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Mountain of Holy Beings, he thought of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only a consummate True God, but his strength was formidable. He also seemed to carry a deep grudge toward the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>'Will he come this time?' Leland thought to himself.</p>
