<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Slowly, the black fist began to emerge from the black hole.</p>

  <p>Then, out came the head, followed by shoulders. A few more moments passed, and the torso and legs were also out.</p>

  <p>It was a creature that had a human-like body shape. However, his head was cylindrical, and there were six pairs of indents on it. These hollow spaces were shimmering almost as they were sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his hands and feet were longer than those of human beings.</p>

  <p>Somehow, they made him look like a moving tree.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came out of the black hole, they felt a wave of pressure being released.</p>

  <p>This was not the soul pressure. Yet, everyone present instantly felt that he was a formidable opponent.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Primeval Lord of Heaven, and others saw this black figure, their eyes began twitching uncontrollably. He looked quite terrifying that their blood froze.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they already guessed there was someone supporting the Snake Spirit King when they saw the black light in the ball earlier.</p>

  <p>But they were still shocked when the one working behind the scenes actually appeared.</p>

  <p>They were even more dumbfounded when they heard Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>Was this creature really the one who destroyed the once mighty and invincible Four Spirits Sect?</p>

  <p>With this, the human spirits felt even more anxious and aggravated.</p>

  <p>They missed the prosperous history of the Four Spirits Sect with all their hearts. At the same time, they had doubts.</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect had survived facing so many powerful existences in the main world. But why must they lose in the end?</p>

  <p>Even if the Snake Spirit King exhausted every ounce of his power, it would be impossible for him to fight with the other sects.</p>

  <p>But now, they finally understood that there was a creature working behind the Snake Spirit King. This creature's power was probably way beyond what they could ever imagine.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? Where the hell did he come from?" one of the human spirits couldn't help asking the question.</p>

  <p>"Why did he destroy the Four Spirits Sect?"</p>

  <p>"What benefits would he get from destroying the Four Spirits Sect and the main world? This is unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>Corbett was trembling slightly. No matter how he thought about it, he still couldn't figure out why the creature wanted to destroy the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters, the Bird Masters, and the human spirits were all curious. What could his motive be?</p>

  <p>Now, even the Snake Masters were confused.</p>

  <p>Why did such a creature appear out of nowhere?</p>

  <p>And more importantly, where was their king?</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Snake Masters were not ignorant.</p>

  <p>They knew that the Snake Spirit King's incredible power came from this creature.</p>

  <p>But why did he want to destroy the Four Spirits Sect? What was his goal behind all this?</p>

  <p>Didn't the Snake Spirit King want to take a strong lead and dominate the world? If so, then why was this creature in his place?</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard a loud booming noise. "Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>The black humanoid creature let out such a strange sound. His laughter could be heard throughout the entire area.</p>

  <p>The six pairs of eyes were focused on Luo Zheng and the irregular heavy sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Answer me!" Luo Zheng raised his voice a little.</p>

  <p>Even though the tone of his voice was eerily calm, it was still commanding.</p>

  <p>"Easy, human," replied the humanoid creature leisurely. "Yes." Afterward, the entire area was silent.</p>

  <p>The silence was broken when they heard a voice. "Why? Why? Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>The voice sounded anguished and enraged.</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was a woman from the Joy House.</p>

  <p>She was so angry that she couldn't help but demand answers.</p>

  <p>It was the same question that everyone was thinking.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature looked down. Then, one of the six pairs of eyes flashed lightly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he slashed the irregular heavy sword downwards. The sword seemed as though it wanted to kill something.</p>

  <p>However, his reaction was a bit slow. So, he missed whatever he wanted to cut.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard that woman's scream coming from below.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!" It was such a blood-curdling scream.</p>

  <p>Pain was a way for creatures to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were tough and powerful. Therefore, it was almost impossible to cause any sharp pain to them. Even if the Light of Annihilation caused their bodies to collapse, they wouldn't make such a spine-chilling scream.</p>

  <p>At once, the woman's entire body began to boil. It was as if some sort of gas had spread out from inside her body. White bubbles began to burst out of her skin. In just a few seconds, she became a mass of white mud.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! What just happened?!" the human spirit closest to her screamed.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's the matter?" another one asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is going on?"</p>

  <p>The human spirits turned pale with fright. They hadn't seen anything like this before.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand how or why she died in such a brutal manner.</p>

  <p>Moments after, they heard a crackling sound.</p>

  <p>Everyone suddenly heard something explode from behind them.</p>

  <p>As they turned around to look, they saw a bright golden light. It burst out from the coordinates floating in the center of the altar. The coordinates were burning and rapidly collapsing.</p>

  <p>Someone instantly figured out what made the sound and yelled, "These are her coordinates!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's face darkened. The coordinates' collapse only meant one thing.</p>

  <p>She was now completely dead.</p>

  <p>"Such a weak and pathetic creature doesn't deserve to get an answer." At that moment, the humanoid creature's voice echoed through the entire sky again. "It's none of your business that I want to kill all of you."</p>

  <p>He merely regarded the Four Spirits Sect as nothing but tiny and helpless ants.</p>

  <p>He looked down upon those insignificant and inferior creatures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened. He was trying so hard to contain his anger. He asked again, "Are you the downgrader?"</p>

  <p>After the ancestry-level bloodline recovered, the first thing it wanted to do was find the downgrader. Therefore, Luo Zheng sought for the humanoid creature's confirmation for its sake.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," the humanoid creature replied arrogantly.</p>

  <p>"So this means you lied to the Snake Spirit King. The so-called upgrade and recovery of the main world are all just a bunch of lies, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked once more. He needed the creature to say it himself.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha. Isn't it obvious already? Of course," the humanoid creature replied nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters were utterly bewildered when they heard this.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King vowed to bring them back to the main world and return them to their previous forms. After all, the fourth-grade world was the Snake Masters' true home. This was where they felt the most comfortable.</p>

  <p>The third-grade chaos was too crowded and monotonous for them. It was like losing their sight and being forced to live in a dark world.</p>

  <p>A while ago, the Snake Masters were absolutely confounded. But now, they finally understood that the Snake Spirit King had led them into a path of no return.</p>

  <p>"Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>Black light!" Out of the blue, they heard someone shout. "You dare lie to me! I'll make you pay for this!"</p>

  <p>It was the Snake Spirit King who was hiding in the black coordinates. In his anger, he suddenly stretched out his head and waved the two black blades to chop the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King already had his suspicions after he killed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>But back then, he had no other choice. The only thing he could do was follow the black light and pray that this was not the truth.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Snake Spirit King was boiling with rage when he heard the truth from the black light itself.</p>

  <p>He wanted to tear the humanoid creature into pieces!</p>

  <p>But before the Snake Spirit King's blades could even come close to the humanoid creature, they instantly shattered into pieces. The Snake Spirit King's black body disintegrated and returned to the coordinates.</p>

  <p>"In the Stellar World, I wiped out the entire Fostering race and the Cinnabar race. Both of those races were a hundred times stronger than you," bragged the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>He continued, "In the World of No Limits, I had once deceived the Sacred Spirit race. And that race was ten thousand times stronger than you."</p>

  <p>"And in the Boundless Divine World, those creatures that disobeyed me were exiled into time and forced to rot. They only needed a millionth of their strength to tear you to shreds," he boasted.</p>

  <p>"In the Boundless Will World, I was an existence that was way beyond what your imaginations can comprehend."</p>

  <p>Everyone fell completely silent as they listened to the creature's horrifying declaration.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the humanoid creature's six pairs of eyes emitted a faint light.</p>

  <p>Everyone could feel the creature's contempt and mockery for them.</p>

  <p>He was the best of the best. He didn't even bother to look down upon all living beings. To him, they were utterly infinitesimal in the grand scheme of things.</p>

  <p>"Having heard all that, what do you think the Four Spirits Sect means to me?" the humanoid creature asked them all.</p>
