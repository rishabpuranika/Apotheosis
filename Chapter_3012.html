<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No one was surprised that Luo Zheng defeated Elgin and Beldene in the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng had been participating in the Truth Competition ever since he recited two thousand words of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Disciples who couldn't recite more than two thousand words didn't challenge Luo Zheng. They hadn't realized yet how much they could benefit from competing against him. All the other disciples, however, were itching to lock horns with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already beaten many of his challengers. Everyone expected him to win against Beldene and Elgin as well.</p>

  <p>"It seems that he's stronger than you thought." Laura glanced towards Ingram.</p>

  <p>Ingram's eyes clouded. "I thought he was about as strong as I was when I had started. I guess I was mistaken. He is much stronger. Is he going to grasp the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent all at once?"</p>

  <p>Laura murmured, "Just like Instant Enlightenment? No wonder he has mastered so many Divine Dao. It's said that there had only been 19 talents capable of such a thing. I've heard about four of them. Three of them cultivated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, while the last one cultivated the Truth of Holy Words."</p>

  <p>"And where are these four warriors now?" Ingram asked.</p>

  <p>Laura smiled rather faintly. "Two of them died. Of the remaining two, one became part of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The last one's in the southeast, defending Dragon Cliff as fiercely as ever."</p>

  <p>Ingram's eyes twinkled with excitement when he heard this.</p>

  <p>Sword Light Palace belonged to Taiyi Heaven Palace. Although Ingram missed the opportunity to be part of Taiyi Heaven Palace, he was familiar with its legends. Based on what Laura said, it seemed that the two remaining warriors continued living as powerful human martial artists.</p>

  <p>"If Luo Zheng is indeed capable of Instant Enlightenment just like the four warriors you've mentioned, does that mean that he..." Ingram's words trailed off with him left shocked.</p>

  <p>But Laura shook her head and said, "Don't think too simply of it. It is far more burdening to be talented. Remember that two of them died. A talented warrior will face greater difficulty."</p>

  <p>As they conversed, Luo Zheng had already recited 9300 words.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent consisted of 9, 449 words. As long as Luo Zheng recited the remaining one hundred, he would be able to fully comprehend its entirety.</p>

  <p>Dalton, Charlene and other palace leaders were all ready to burst out of their seats.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that our Sword Light Palace will gain a talent capable of Instant Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>"Officiant, if this person indeed is capable of such a thing, what will be the reward for sending him to Taiyi Heaven Palace?"</p>

  <p>The officiant paused for a moment, then shook his head. "For that, I would have to consult the ancient books."</p>

  <p>The officiant couldn't answer the question. Not many organizations in the Source World could match the might of Taiyi Heaven Palace. In fact, Sword Light Palace was only under its jurisdiction. There had never been a warrior capable of Instant Enlightenment in its history.</p>

  <p>But the leaders knew the impact Luo Zheng might have on Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng comprehended the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the palace leaders had scoffed at Ingram. They had doubted Luo Zheng's capabilities to qualify for Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>At this point, however, they were entirely certain. They were even hoping to receive benefits for sending Luo Zheng to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The essence of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was in its last four hundred and forty-nine words. It was no surprise then that almost every word was so difficult to recite. Despite this, Luo Zheng did not seem frustrated and calmly recited down to the last word.</p>

  <p>At this point, his sword-shaped pattern had reached the top of the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>After reciting the entirety of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"By reciting this cultivation method, the warriors can keep its existence forever and may use it to safeguard human prosperity. No wonder this Truth of Divine Dao is called Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. It must have been compiled by a human martial arts master," Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Lofty Sword, which stood seven hundred thousand feet tall, began to vibrate.</p>

  <p>The sword had its own blade, but it was not sharp enough. At that moment, a dazzling white light suddenly surrounded the blade, and the whole sword gleamed.</p>

  <p>All the disciples, palace leaders, and even Laura were stunned at the sight.</p>

  <p>"Is a powerful nonhuman monster coming?"</p>

  <p>"Now? That's impossible..."</p>

  <p>"Then why is the sword reacting so violently? It only does so when a powerful nonhuman monster is about to show up!"</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword was on the Seven-Star Mountain. Aside from being the Sword Light Palace's foundation, it also protected the entire Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>If there was a powerful nonhuman monster attacking, the sword would sense it and automatically cut the intruder as they were still thousands of miles away. The Lofty Sword's sudden movement had thus made everyone unease.</p>

  <p>"Could it be related to Luo Zheng's Instant Enlightenment?" someone murmured.</p>

  <p>The officiant remembered something and clapped his hands. "Yes! That's why!"</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, at the center of the Lofty Sword appeared a strange, circular rune. The air surrounding it constantly condensed. After a few moments, a huge voice transmission array formed.</p>

  <p>Voices in such transmission arrays could travel long distances. In fact, it had power similar to that of Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>

  <p>However, Yellow Emperor Magatama was capable of sending messages to many targets, as long as they were Yellow Emperor Guards. On the other hand, this voice transmission array was relatively rigid, though the voice was transmitted much farther.</p>

  <p>Right after the voice transmission array formed, a thunderous voice boomed.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Good! I planted seven swords in different provinces many decades ago. I never expected to be surprised with a man capable of Instant Enlightenment!"</p>

  <p>The palace leaders looked astounded. They had never imagined a voice transmission array within the sword.</p>

  <p>Laura and the officiant, however, trembled in awe upon recognizing the voice.</p>

  <p>The voice belonged to Qiu Yinhe Qiu, creator of the Lofty Sword and founder of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>He was also one of the Qiu Clan's and the Yuebai Clan's ancestors.</p>

  <p>He frequently travelled across the Source World and never stayed too long in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>It was just like what he said. He had created seven Lofty Swords, just as he'd established seven sects like Sword Light Palace. Moreover, the places he'd chosen to do so were seven vast provinces where beasts and monsters prevailed.</p>

  <p>But until now, only two Lofty Swords still existed.</p>

  <p>One of them was in Sword Light Palace. The other five established sects were counterattacked by peerless nonhuman monsters. They dissipated from history shortly after. Even the Lofty Swords were destroyed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly hearing Qiu Yinhe Qiu's voice excited the officiant the most. He had been in charge of the Lofty Sword for so many years, yet this was the first time he witnessed the activation of the voice transmission array!</p>

  <p>"Ma... Master Qiu Yinhe..."</p>

  <p>For a moment, the officiant was at a loss for words. After all, how was he supposed to address the founder of Sword Light Palace, his ancestor?</p>
