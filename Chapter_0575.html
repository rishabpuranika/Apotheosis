<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Frank had thought that Patrick was the only one strong enough to fight with him.</p>

  <p>Back then when they were battling the three Flying Yakshas, he used all of his might to not only defeat, but kill a Yaksha. Channeling every ounce of strength he had left, he attacked, dodged, and fought against the strongest one. Patrick unleashed the Acalanatha shadow. But the Yaksha's defense was so intense that Patrick was still defeated.</p>

  <p>Patrick gave blow after blow, threw punches against the Yaksha, but his defense was too weak. He kept on targeting his enemy's strong body that he forgot to defend his own.</p>

  <p>As the battle came to an end, the Flying Yaksha finished Patrick and gave him three last blows before he was on the floor, bruised. Although defeated, Frank still believed in Patrick' strength and courage as a fighter.</p>

  <p>After all, the Green Locus Karma Fire was all too powerful.</p>

  <p>Maybe Frank could easily break Patrick's Body in the Diamond-like State with his spear, but he could not bear the Green Locus Karma Fire Patrick could give off.</p>

  <p>Comparing warriors of the same level was a very difficult thing to do, let alone fighting off one another just to see who the better warrior was.</p>

  <p>Would battling it out give the answer? Frank was all too confident, thinking that he would have this one in the bag, that Patrick was just another competitor he would bruise.</p>

  <p>As for Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng, Frank didn't pay attention to them at all as they were at such a lower cultivation level than him and they didn't show their strengths.</p>

  <p>Seeing the two nature creatures, Frank suddenly remembered what Patrick had tried to say to him before. "On the Death Road, with their help..."</p>

  <p>Frank interrupted Patrick at that time as Frank believed that even the most ordinary disciple of the Illuminating Soul Realm was useless and weak. How could those two nature creatures be of any help? He had shown his respect to them even when he thought the two of them were useless to him!</p>

  <p>If he had known what would happen later, he should have asked more about them. In this way he would not have been so embarrassed now.</p>

  <p>The embarrassment was kicking his gut!</p>

  <p>It was such a shame that Frank was too proud. He had always been like this, even as a little boy. It had now become a trait of his pride. The two could have helped him in his time of need!</p>

  <p>Frank felt his face slightly flush out of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Tianming's Extreme Thunder Sword Intent could kill the Dark Devil Phantoms that were swarming them. With the great power that his sword had, he waved it numerous times to kill his foes. Dark Devil Phantoms were cut, but there were too many of them. Each time he killed one, more and more came in.</p>

  <p>Tianming was running out of strength. He battled ferociously against the Dark Devil Phantoms that kept on appearing. He gasped heavily, and dropped to the floor as he could not swing his sword any more. He could not do it alone especially when he had just learned the skill!</p>

  <p>Seeing Tianming become exhausted, the disciples got tensed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, standing in the corner, frowned at the sight of the battle. He thought of ways on how to defeat the phantoms.</p>

  <p>The Dark Devil Phantom was pure evil. It was pure energy. It didn't have any real body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, pondering a solution, suddenly realized something. 'If it is a kind of energy, as the life vitality is, can my demonic life vitality swallow it?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked himself inwardly.</p>

  <p>It was possible. After all, Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality was truly remarkable and powerful. His demonic life vitality could turn whatever it swallowed into the same life vitality continuously. If this was true, then they would defeat the Dark Devil Phantoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his hand, waving, and six demonic phantoms appeared out of thin air, surrounding him.</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?" Frank and the others were surprised at what Luo Luo Zheng was doing. As Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand, the six demonic phantoms appeared to be ready to swallow the Dark Devil Phantoms that were attacking them.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's efforts to try to defeat the Dark Devil Phantoms, Frank thought of his attacks on the Dark Devil Phantom with his spear a moment ago, which didn't work. 'It's useless, ' Frank shook his head and thought. 'He is trying in vain.'</p>

  <p>To Frank, seeing six demonic phantoms summoned at once was amazing, but still useless compared to the dark force that was about to swipe them all.</p>

  <p>"Peng! Peng!"</p>

  <p>The sound of six demonic phantoms colliding with the Dark Devil Phantoms filled the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Frank sighed as he had already known it was useless and a waste of time.</p>

  <p>He now doubted what Patrick had told him about Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tianming was definitely strong, but Luo Luo Zheng seemed not.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, normal attacking is useless to the Dark Devil Phantom." Patrick reminded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He controlled his six demonic phantoms to turn them into pieces and then into demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Swallow!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's plan was working. The demonic life vitality could swallow other energy and turn it into life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sensed the changing demonic life vitality in his body. Soon, a smile started to appear on his face. He opened his eyes. "I did it!"</p>

  <p>"What? Hmm... What did you do?" Tianming asked while panting.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't reply and just looked at the demonic life vitality with a smile on his face. He could feel his life vitality swallowing the Dark Devil Phantoms. His demonic life vitality was growing!</p>

  <p>The other disciples were looking at Luo Luo Zheng, looking confused. 'Is Luo Luo Zheng crazy?' they thought.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a huge hole inside a Dark Devil Phantom appeared. Purple life vitality shoot out of it.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Frank asked with his eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>All the people, including that mysterious disciple from the Cloud Hall, stared at the life vitality changing right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>After the first Dark Devil Phantom burst, the other five followed. Soon there were great amounts of purple life vitality. The Dark Devil Phantoms Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality collided with had disappeared completely. The Dark Devil Phantoms disappeared since they had been swallowed by Luo Zheng's life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand in the air and the six clouds of demonic life vitality gathered together and formed a huge cloud with a diameter more than 100 feet long. Luo Luo Zheng shouted, "Go!"</p>

  <p>Dark purple arrows of life vitality were continuously shot from the super huge cloud of demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng never conceived an "arrow" before so the arrow was heterocercal-- very unequal. But it didn't matter. What was more important was that there were great amounts of arrows.</p>

  <p>'That purple life vitality is Luo Zheng's? How did he do it?' Frank was puzzled and asked himself silently. In his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng just did an amazing thing. He did not understand it at all.</p>

  <p>Seeing and facing something one could not understand, he would feel amazed. Frank was amazed now.</p>

  <p>Lois and Lewis were also got astonished. They stared at Luo Luo Zheng and wondered what had happened after Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality rushed inside the Dark Devil Phantoms. Why did the Dark Devil Phantoms disappear? And how did there appear so much extra life vitality all of a sudden? They couldn't believe their eyes!</p>

  <p>Even that mysterious disciple from the Cloud Hall seemed to be surprised. He looked at Luo Luo Zheng with mixed feelings and spoke in a very soft voice, "He is actually practicing 'Heavenly Ogre Fist'. Maybe he can help me!"</p>

  <p>Seeing such an amazing feat from Luo Luo Zheng, this reminded Tianming and Patrick of something--Luo Luo Zheng had already done this when he attended the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>During the fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Dick, Dick wrote his 'Righteousness Song' by his life vitality. In the end, the 'Righteousness Song' was swallowed by Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>It had happened quickly, and only a few people noticed it, including Patrick and Tianming. But they couldn't care less and did not pay too much attention to it. Now, Tianming and Patrick suddenly realized how overwhelming Luo Zheng's life vitality was!</p>

  <p>What happened next surprised them even more.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's command, thousands of small arrows were shot into the Dark Devil Phantoms. Then, the Dark Devil Phantoms seemed to have been struck by lightning and stopped moving.</p>

  <p>The whole area seemed to be frozen and all the Dark Devil Phantoms stopped moving. Frank and other disciples stayed quiet. Looking at what was happening in front of them, they were expecting something to happen. What happened next did not disappoint them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand again and shouted, "Go!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, slight sounds of explosion were heard continuously in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Peng! Peng!"</p>

  <p>Hundreds of Dark Devil Phantoms exploded at the same time and purple demonic life vitality flooded out of the Dark Devil Phantoms.</p>

  <p>Only one Dark Devil Phantom was enough to make Luo Zheng's belly full. Now there were hundreds of Dark Devil Phantoms swallowed by Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality. What a great amount of life vitality!</p>

  <p>The great amounts of demonic life vitality were drifting in the dark sky like huge clouds.</p>

  <p>There were too much demonic life vitality in the area that if Luo Luo Zheng tried to absorb all the demonic life vitality, his body would explode.</p>

  <p>All of the people looked at the purple life vitality like clouds while quailing. They had never seen such a huge amount of life vitality together like this! The people had never seen anyone who could give off such a great deal of life vitality in a short time! Even the head of the Cloud Hall could not deal with so much life vitality inside the body!</p>

  <p>After a while, they heard Luo Luo Zheng spoke, which made them feel both humored and annoyed. "It is a great pity to waste so much life vitality..."</p>
