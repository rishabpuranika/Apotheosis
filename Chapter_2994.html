  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't expected this woman to pay attention to him.</p>

  <p>After all, it was Kenelm who had presented the cyan sword to her, not Zheng.</p>

  <p>She shouldn't have reacted that way.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Zheng immediately put on a worried look and said,</p>

  <p>"This huge reward is indeed amazing. I'm just worried that Kenelm may not be able to bear it. As the saying goes, an innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth."</p>

  <p>The pale woman looked at Zheng and thoughtfully asked, "So you're worried about this? Well, it's not a difficult problem... I can only give him a part of it for the time being... But you are right! If all the reward is given to Kenelm, I'm afraid that many people from the Sword Light Palace will be tempted to rob him."</p>

  <p>Nervousness was written all over Kenelm's face. He looked at the woman and asked anxiously, "Then what should I do?"</p>

  <p>The pale woman glanced at him indifferently and looked away. She said,</p>

  <p>"What should you do? That has nothing to do with me. If you can find ten people, I will take you on the journey. However, I will only wait for one day."</p>

  <p>With that, she floated in the air and left.</p>

  <p>The three men from the Sword Light Palace followed her too. Worried about being seen as a poor host, the lord of the Excellence City also left to follow them.</p>

  <p>Only Zheng, Kenelm and the guards of the Qi Clan remained.</p>

  <p>These guards couldn't dare to take revenge. They were sure that the woman would not trouble them, so they, too, escaped quickly one by one.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was worried sick by now. The more he thought about Zheng's words, the more he was convinced. He asked, "Zheng, what... what should I do?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and comforted him, "Don't worry too much, Kenelm. The reward of the Sword Light Palace is very valuable, but you can refuse it."</p>

  <p>"What! Refuse it?" Kenelm was shocked to hear this.</p>

  <p>The reward was enough to make the Lai Clan a formidable force in the entire Gracious Province. Nobody would refuse it casually.</p>

  <p>Hesitation and pain were written all over his face.</p>

  <p>"After all, you've attained your goal of getting the tomb and joining the Sword Light Palace, haven't you? If you are obsessed with this wealth, it will only bring you trouble, and even cause a fatal disaster," Zheng continued with his warning.</p>

  <p>He could only advise Kenelm to keep his wellbeing in mind, but he couldn't interfere with Kenelm's final decision.</p>

  <p>Human beings died in pursuit of wealth, and birds died in pursuit of food.</p>

  <p>Even the True God was no exception. It was just that the wealth in their case was divine crystals. Not everyone was able to resist the temptation of large wealth.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, Kenelm got ten places in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>The news spread like wildfire and attracted the attention of all the clans in the Excellence City. dozens of clan leaders paid a visit to Kenelm hoping to buy a place from him.</p>

  <p>After making arrangements for the four people of the Sword Light Palace, the lord of the Excellence City went back in the hope that he would get at least one or two places from Kenelm.</p>

  <p>Kenelm had not forgotten his friends who had gone to the cave with him that day. They were all ecstatic about the news. Although they didn't help much, they had risked their lives anyway and that was a big deal. The qualification of being able to enter the Sword Light Palace was the best reward for them.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't need one of the places, but Kenelm insisted on giving him one.</p>

  <p>When Zheng refused to accept it, the lord of the Excellence City said, "Zheng, I have a message for you from Master Laura."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng was a little puzzled. He couldn't understand why Laura had asked the lord of the Excellence City to bring him a message.</p>

  <p>"Master Laura said that if you went to the Sword Light Palace, she would assign you a special place, and... If you stay in the Gracious Province, the Qi Clan will seek revenge against you. If they send people to go after you, you might be in big trouble," said the lord of the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly. Laura's message was subtle, but there was obviously a hint of coercion in it.</p>

  <p>But why did that woman want Zheng to join the Sword Light Palace?</p>

  <p>If Zheng really wanted to join a big force, there were better choices. Even though the Pear Hill was far away from here, he would have arrived there after a long time if he insisted on going there. Not only would he be able to get protection from Emily, but he would also be able to stay with Yan.</p>

  <p>Zheng was about to reject firmly when No. 9527 suddenly said, "Zheng, say yes."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Why?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng had repeatedly asked what Chiyou had spoken to No. 9527, but the latter refused to tell him, so he didn't know what to do. But now No. 9527 was asking him to join the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>"Just listen to me," continued No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"But you haven't told me the reason yet!" Zheng was a little uncertain and dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>"But this is what Chiyou wanted you to do. So, I'll make a plan for your future route," No. 9527 grinned.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you think I am?" Zheng's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Why, you're just a chess piece!" No. 9527 joked.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get lost!"</p>

  <p>Zheng reluctantly agreed despite not knowing its true plan.</p>

  <p>Convincing Zheng was a mission from Laura. When Zheng changed his mind and agreed, the lord of the Excellence City was finally relieved.</p>

  <p>He surmised that Laura had asked Zheng to join the Sword Light Palace because he had performed the merging of Godly Ways. When a man could merge so many Godly Ways, he must be talented even if he hadn't reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Of course, a True God lived on forever. It wouldn't be a big deal when Zheng practiced several hundred or thousand Godly Ways if he was tens of millions of years old, or even hundreds of millions of years old. But this guy was less than two hundred years old!</p>

  <p>There were six places left with Kenelm after Zheng was specially given a place by the woman.</p>

  <p>Two of the six places were allocated to the members of the Lai Clan, two to the lord of the Excellence City, and the other two to the two big clans of the Excellence City. So everyone could be happy. The Lai Clan was not a big clan in the Excellence City so it was likely that it would now gain prominence thanks to Kenelm.</p>

  <p>The following day, in the East Port of the Excellence City, the lord of the Excellence City was seeing those people off with his subordinates.</p>

  <p>The pale woman held the long cyan sword in her hand, and, there was an indelible sadness in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She did not reveal the fact that the owner of the cyan sword was her own father.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of years had passed, and her grief had already subsided, but many parties were involved in her father's death. If this sword was taken back to the Sword Light Palace now, she would have to suffer a lot.</p>

  <p>As she was reflecting on this, her gaze swept down the large flying ship and finally landed on Zheng.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, he was the only one who had the qualifications to enter the Sword Light Palace among the eleven people who got the places. He was her only hope.</p>
