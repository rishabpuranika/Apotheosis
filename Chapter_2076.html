<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the same time, what was happening in the Evolutionary Universe was not to be ignored.</p>

  <p>The battle there was getting more and more intense.</p>

  <p>"Give up! You know as well as I do that there's no point in struggling!"</p>

  <p>Mateo howled coldly.</p>

  <p>Right then, Mateo discreetly activated some sort of secret technique.</p>

  <p>Black blood continued flowing out like streams from his eyes. And as the blood gushed, as dark as a starless midnight sky, it rapidly turned into a black, bloody mist before wrapping him up tightly.</p>

  <p>Surges of starlight were repeatedly released from Wynn's open hand. The starlight shot out in two opposing directions, turning into a slender starlight ray and shooting toward Mateo.</p>

  <p>The starlight was extremely sharp, like the fiercest blade. So much so that previously, when he was fighting with Pranav, Pranav had actually feared it and done his best to stay as far away from it as possible.</p>

  <p>Mateo, on the other hand, demonstrated a fearless Mu Ning. He stood confidently. As the starlight pierced through the black mist surrounding him, it was instantly swallowed whole.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Mateo grunted, as he repelled Wynn's powerful attack, pointing forcefully at him.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>A mass of black mist immediately appeared by Wynn's side. When the black mist came into contact with his body, his expression drastically changed. With a quick twist of his torso, he managed to save the vital parts of his body. The same couldn't be said for his arm and foot though, both of which sadly disappeared into the mist, leaving nothing at all behind.</p>

  <p>"I almost killed you," Mateo stated calmly.</p>

  <p>Wynn steadied his body. Starlight flashed in his gloomy eyes, and in a matter of seconds, he grew himself a new arm and foot.</p>

  <p>The black mist wasn't actually a real mist at all, but tiny insects, no larger than the needle hole. They were known as the Waves Devouring Worms, and they fed on blood energy. They had to live in a life form with powerful blood energy in order to survive.</p>

  <p>Mateo used his exuberant blood energy to support a large number of Waves Devouring Worms. If he encountered an enemy strong enough, and it was worth it, he would drive these black worms out to fight.</p>

  <p>A few seconds ago, Wynn made nothing but slight contact with the black mist formed by the Waves Devouring Worms. And even so, one of his arms and one of his feet had been devoured. Clearly, these worms were more than just powerful. They were dominant.</p>

  <p>Due to this worm controlling secret technique, Wynn was being slowly beaten back little by little. Mateo though, appeared to consolidate at every step, as if victory was already within his grasp.</p>

  <p>In this battle between two True Gods, Wynn was obviously at an absolute disadvantage.</p>

  <p>In comparison however, the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were in an even more miserable circumstance.</p>

  <p>Before Mateo and Marko intervened in the fight between the Supreme Lords, the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were still capable of suppressing those of the Sacred race. However, once Mateo and Marko had joined the fight, the situation began to take a turn.</p>

  <p>The first to die were naturally the Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land. Soon after, the patriarchs of Lawson's Lie Clan and Lucille's Ji Clan were equally killed by Marko. However, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the patriarch of Nathan's Xuanyuan Clan, pulled out a strange treasure: a bamboo raft.</p>

  <p>This said bamboo raft was a treasure passed down for generations since the ancient times by the Xuanyuan Clan, and was given to them by Mike's disciples. The moment the bamboo raft was released, it split into thousands of bamboo forests and trapped Pranav within them. For a long while, Pranav couldn't break through the confusing maze array of bamboo forests.</p>

  <p>Although Pranav was temporarily trapped, Supreme Lord of Original Sin's heart was still heavy. Even if he was using his full strength, he was still unable to kill Pranav. Moreover, the heavens was filled with intense tremors.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" the patriarch of Janet's Ji Clan questioned.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was one of the core members of the four great clans that formed the Thoughtless Minds together. If they encountered any unsolvable difficulty, they would request advice from and listen to Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p>Now that the patriarchs of two clans had died, the Ji Clan's patriarch was really starting to feel flustered. His only choice now was to turn to Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p>The first thing he noticed was that Supreme Lord of Original Sin looked pale, almost as if he were ill.</p>

  <p>This was because as the leader of the four great clans, he had never suffered such a defeat before. A feeling of powerlessness assaulted him, and the clan's teachings appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>Each of the four great clans had mysterious teachings that were passed down from their ancestors. They were the messages that the disciples of the Holy Being had shared with their descendants.</p>

  <p>"As part of the universe, you must make a difference. However, the more powerful you are, the heavier your responsibility. If there comes a day when you come across a calamity, you're obliged to do all you can to fight."</p>

  <p>The teachings of the four great clans were all different, but the contents were roughly the same.</p>

  <p>These four great clans lived in the universe and became the most powerful forces there. They relied on the inheritances of the Holy Being's disciples, and they had all the resources they could ever need or imagine directly at their command.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being's disciples had specifically trained the four great clans to deal with this kind of tribulation. Supreme Lord of Original Sin had long known the secret behind this, and he already had the will to sacrifice himself.</p>

  <p>"These people are so powerful that even if I were to sacrifice myself, I still wouldn't be a match for them," Supreme Lord of Original Sin smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>Before, Mike's disciples had calculated the strength of the Murphy Universe's Supreme Lords. However, they hadn't been able to predict the decision of the Hall of Holy Beings. Of course, they never expected that Murphy would actually send three True Gods to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin turned his face away and noticed that the two ogre Supreme Lords were being chased down by the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race tens of millions of miles away.</p>

  <p>He might not be a match for a True God, but ordinary Supreme Lords were far inferior to him.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>As the Space Law exploded beneath his feet, he activated the Grand Teleportation technique and rushed toward the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Pranav was trying hard to break through the bamboo forests.</p>

  <p>Although the maze array was powerful, it still wasn't strong enough to trap Pranav for long. Supreme Lord of Original Sin knew very well that it wouldn't be long before Pranav managed to break through the array.</p>

  <p>Before that happened though, he planned to kill as many Supreme Lords of the Sacred race as possible.</p>

  <p>In the starry sky of the Upper World, streams of light flew in all directions. Occasionally, stars would fall from the sky, and sometimes, huge balls of flames would explode. The flames were of different colors: yellow, white, and purple. They were gorgeously bright, blinding even, and their light could easily outshine the sun.</p>

  <p>All the mortals were kneeling now, praying.</p>

  <p>Not only humans, in fact, all sentient beings throughout the universe were doing the same. Even those who weren't sentient but had souls were down on their knees.</p>

  <p>They were praying because their entire universe was filled with a sense of utter and absolute crisis.</p>

  <p>This intangible sense of crisis could, and would, affect anything in the Evolutionary Universe. From the grass, to the mountains, rocks, deserts and stars, everything had a strong desire to survive.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the momentum within the Evolutionary Universe had equally soared under such circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Master Feng raised his hand and slapped the Sacred race's Grand Supreme Lord so hard that it sent him flying straight into the air.</p>

  <p>A terrifying energy immediately pressed down on his body. The energy contained the Evolutionary Universe's momentum, which contributed to its incomparable power.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the protection of the spinulose wood fern, that strike would have easily shattered him to thousands of pieces.</p>

  <p>The two Supreme Lords that controlled the Heavens-suppressing Objects had been fighting with each other from the very beginning. It was difficult to determine who was stronger, but as the momentum in the Evolutionary Universe increased, Master Feng appeared to hold the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Because of Master Feng's slap, a tiny crack could be seen slithering along the center of the spinulose wood fern.</p>

  <p>"Once again!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng clasped his hands together. As the Evolution Lotus Flower spun, a terrifying momentum once again flowed into his palms, but he didn't stop there. His greatest desire was to kill his enemy in one fell swoop and shatter the spinulose wood fern to pieces.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng swallowed the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill, he immediately felt the blood in his body begin to bubble and boil. An unprecedented power surged out from the golden blood, flowing crazily in his body as his heart pounded it out at an extremely high speed.</p>

  <p>Pound. Pound. Pound.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was beating like a drum. His heartbeat was unexpectedly ten thousand times faster than usual. His breathing accelerated.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that mortals' hearts could beat from three to five times in three seconds.</p>

  <p>Warriors' bodies were strong, and their hearts were also abnormally strong. When they reached Zheng's level though, their hearts could only beat once in five minutes. At this very moment though, Luo Zheng could actually feel his heart beating a hundred times in three seconds.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current willpower, he was capable of enduring the pain.</p>

  <p>After fifteen minutes, the flow of Zheng's blood began to slow, eventually coming to a stop, and his heart also stopped beating maniacally.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's blood had become thick. As his blood and vitality grew stronger, his body's recovery ability also improved by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>After swallowing the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill, Luo Zheng chose to not swallow the Emotion Closing Pill. Instead, he stood up and rushed out of the pill refining room, heading straight for the True Path.</p>
