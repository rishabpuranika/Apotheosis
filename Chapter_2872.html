  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I never heard about it before," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>This made the woman even more curious. She asked, "Aren't you from the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," Luo Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>They couldn't see each other in the Sea of Truth. Luo Zheng had no reason to hide his identity from the woman since it'd be impossible for her to discover his origin.</p>

  <p>"Let me guess. You're from the Green Sky Land? The Ghost Hunting race?</p>

  <p>No, that couldn't be. They are much taller than you," the woman continued to speculate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never intended to reveal his background. He had something else in mind.</p>

  <p>These people were notorious for robbing others' soul pills on the Sea of Truth. Luo Zheng intended to follow their footsteps.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't do it alone.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to enter the Sea of Truth with his body, his soul would have to leave the sea first.</p>

  <p>The soul pills he robbed using his physical body wouldn't work on his soul.</p>

  <p>He could work with the woman.</p>

  <p>Upon realizing this, he couldn't get it off his mind. He gazed into the distance where fifteen boats sped off and turned into small black dots floating on the horizon.</p>

  <p>The woman was still trying to figure out Luo Zheng's origin when he said, "Let's go after those people."</p>

  <p id="top_3">"But why? You want them to rob you again?" the woman asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm going to find a way to return your soul pills," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Return my soul pills? That'll be unnecessary," she said with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>Given her status, a few lost soul pills didn't matter much.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued, "Not just that. I'll get more soul pills but only if you help me. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>This left the woman confused once more.</p>

  <p>Not only was Luo Zheng from outside the Source World, but he was also poor.</p>

  <p>How would he be able to get the soul pills? Did he plan to rob them? By himself?</p>

  <p>"Enlighten me. How do you plan on getting those soul pills?" The woman was intrigued.</p>

  <p>"You will know," Luo Zheng uttered.</p>

  <p>The woman asked no more questions. She sailed her Truth Boat and followed Luo Zheng from behind.</p>

  <p>The two boats pushed forward against the Sea of Truth's waves.</p>

  <p>As they moved forward further, the waves began to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>A harsh wind from the north blew over and stung Luo Zheng's skin. However, he continued to stand at the nose of his boat and follow the fleet up ahead with calm.</p>

  <p>"I heard that people from outside the Source World don't have the strongest souls. You seem different though. This is your first time entering the Sea of Truth and yet you seem unperturbed crossing the first section," the woman admitted with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"We're drawing nearer to the first line now," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>After they sailed a long distance, dense starlight and a cool chill soon enveloped the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"It's almost time," Luo Zheng said. "You continue following those guys. I'll be back."</p>

  <p>"What? Where are you going?" the woman asked, stunned.</p>

  <p>"Just wait for me. By the way, what's your name?" Luo Zheng asked her.</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated a moment. "I... I'm Dora," she said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>Obviously, she didn't give him her real name. The people sailing on the Sea of Truth were on alert.</p>

  <p>"Dora,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng repeated. He then asked No. 9527 to drag him out of the sea.</p>

  <p>One way to quickly leave the Sea of Truth was by activating the Illusion Breaking Rune, but this method only existed in the Source World. Luo Zheng's solution to this was to get the assistance of No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>With a tremble, Luo Zheng and his boat disappeared before Dora's eyes.</p>

  <p>Dora had no idea what he was up to, but she wanted to wait and see what happened next. Obediently, she continued following those guys and now drew nearer to the first line.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began to mutter an incantation upon leaving the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Then, the girl with red eyes appeared beside him.</p>

  <p>His last encounter with the Sea of Truth was when she refined his body with her flames.</p>

  <p>He had tried to refine his body with fire numerous times before that. Why could he only get into the Sea of Truth at that time?</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was just as clueless.</p>

  <p>Even if No. 9527 possessed the Chaos Ancient God's memory, it wasn't wiser than the latter.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng wished to try again.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The girl blinked and then red lotuses began to encircle Luo Zheng before covering him completely.</p>

  <p>The training tower might not be able to bear her flames. But she, a born fire controller, could control the heat to avoid burning the tower to ashes.</p>

  <p>The surface of Luo Zheng's body changed dramatically as the heat began to pour into him.</p>

  <p>Golden vortexes swirled all around him as the red lotuses that wrapped him earlier transformed into a red sea of fire.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly realized he had entered a unique state. He could sense that he could now enter the sea of fire with a step forward and return to reality with a step backward.</p>

  <p>'There's no secret after all. Once my body reaches this state, I can freely step into the Sea of Truth, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>With no hesitation, he fell into the sea of fire.</p>

  <p>Once the Souls of Light stepped into the Sea of Truth, they felt a bitter cold.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, felt burning heat reminiscent of summer.</p>

  <p>"Last time I crossed the first section, I have to swim downstream if I want to catch up with those guys."</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spread out his arms before gracefully diving into the water and then jumping out of its surface, disguising himself as a nimble fish from a distance. His speed was so astonishing that he managed to cross the first line within just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Look! A fish from the other side of the first line is swimming towards us!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible. The two sides of the first line were two completely different worlds."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's a fish. I think that's...a person."</p>

  <p>"What? How?"</p>

  <p>A fish moving at that speed was more believable than a person.</p>

  <p>The first line was an insurmountable bottleneck for almost all the consummate True Gods. They had never heard of someone going back after crossing it with great effort.</p>

  <p>What was more shocking was that this person didn't sail a Truth Boat but swam in the sea, completely beyond reason for those on board. Those who wandered by the first line watched Luo Zheng leave with mouths agape.</p>
