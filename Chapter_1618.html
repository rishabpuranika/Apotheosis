<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's so strange. You are clearly using the Floating Feather Technique.</p>

  <p>Who did you learn this movement technique from?" the woman asked with a puzzled look on her delicate features.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "I'll tell you, but first, tell me who are you?"</p>

  <p>When the woman heard this, she indifferently replied, "This here is the Corridor of Emperor?"</p>

  <p>"You are an Emperor?" Luo Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he interrupted.</p>

  <p>"No," the woman shook her head. "I am the mark left behind by a True God."</p>

  <p>"A True God?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed when he heard the woman's reply, and realized the implications thereof.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change in Luo Zheng's expression, the woman sighed faintly. "This is your test. Although I am just a mark, I will still test your soul?"</p>

  <p>While the woman was speaking, she lightly waved her hands and a glacier appeared in the heavens and began thundering down from the sky towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>This glacier was one hundred feet wide, and the temperature near it was extremely low. As the glacier descended at a murderous speed, it had already congealed into a thick icicle falling from the air, charging towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Using a True God's illusion to test my soul..." Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>A look of caution and apprehension appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he faced the glacier falling towards him from above. Suddenly, he swung his fist!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's fist collided with this glacier, a crack appeared at the bottom of the glacier. The crack immediately ran out and spread like a spider's web through the thickly packed ice. Then this glacier turned into countless pieces of broken ice that collapsed and shot out with a loud bang to the land in a circle with a diameter of several hundred meters.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a flash of Luo Zheng's body, a second glacier was suddenly falling towards him!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>With a punch, the glacier shattered yet again, in a shower of ice shards that scattered on the land below.</p>

  <p>The woman quietly floated in the air, lifting the small bell in her hand.</p>

  <p>Her face was calm and almost serene.</p>

  <p>This space had been forcibly preserved as a memory of the heavens.</p>

  <p>However, even though this woman had transcended the heavens and become a True God, her memories of being born into this round of the heavens were permanent, and beyond being erased.</p>

  <p>"So far, there have been one thousand and four hundred warriors flying through this area. But none of them were compatible with my Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>The woman flicked her ten fingers and several blue spots of crystalline light appeared in the sky overhead.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Tens of glaciers came roaring down!</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was dodging the gauntlet of ice, his mighty fists broke through the glaciers one by one.</p>

  <p>"Your Divine Dao? What is your Divine Dao?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, intrigued by the woman's words.</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes glimmered. "I use ice as my body and have already been imprisoned in the glacier for a hundred thousand years. Finally, I have comprehended the Snow Divine Dao and obtained the Mysterious Ice Godly Tile. My name is Hannah?" she said.</p>

  <p>This Illusion Battlefield was an excellent opportunity for ordinary martial artists to cultivate in extreme conditions.</p>

  <p>Countless martial artists that had gone through the tests of life and death here would find that their strength had increased by leaps and bounds, after they left the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, to those special warriors and ace talents, this strength enhancement was as nothing. For them, what could be accomplished in the Illusion Battlefield was also something that could be performed in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>But what they had obtained in the Illusion Battlefield was far more important and priceless than that the ordinary martial artists had obtained, for example the thing they could obtain in this Corridor of Emperor!</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao was of course the way one could use to become a True God!</p>

  <p>Those who could cross the heavens and become a True God numbered very few in the universe. There were very few warriors or clans that claimed to own the Divine Dao, and there were no more than ten talents in the entire universe who possessed the qualifications to practice the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>This type of person was known as a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses were beings that far surpassed the ace talents. Even if all the clans and forces gathered together, they would only be able to gather a handful of these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Even some Supreme Lords themselves didn't have the qualifications to follow the Divine Dao, so it was even more impossible for their descendants to accomplish it.</p>

  <p>Lucille, whom Luo Luo Zheng had met before, was the ace talent of the Ji Clan, and was also the most likely person to become a Godly Genius of the Ji Clan!</p>

  <p>What the Ji Clan possessed was the Five Elements Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>And the most important sign indicating the transformation of a Godly Genius was the full blooming of the Mahayana Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>Some warriors had only stepped into the Soul Sea, and their Hinayana Lotus Flowers would bloom with seven petals, or even nine petals.</p>

  <p>However, they had never managed to open up a Mahayana Lotus Flower during their entire lives spent in cultivation!</p>

  <p>There were some martial artists that had opened up the Mahayana Lotus Flower when they were at the Spirit Supreme Realm or the Spirit Transformation Realm. And later, when they had become world lords, or when they managed to carry a Heavenly Destiny, they might be able to open up all the lotus petals of the Mahayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors in this situation were called "talents being restrained by the heavens". The majority of the Supreme Lords in the universe belonged to this kind of warriors. They had no hope of stepping into the Divine Dao in their lengthy lifetimes.</p>
