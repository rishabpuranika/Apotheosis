</p>

  <p>"Hold on just a second, why does it seem as though there's some sort of unusual attribute contained inside his Fighting Soul?" With his glare fixated on Zheng, Dennis sensed that there was something out of the ordinary being exuded by Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei realized in an instant what Zheng had been through and let out a smile, "If I'm guessing correctly, our leader decided to hand over to him a Ganoderma Soul Pill produced by the Dragon Abyss Palace."</p>

  <p>Alan forced a dull smile and remarked, "Your Dragon Abyss Palace was quite the generous one. A Ganoderma Soul Pill is much too costly even if its power is rather below mediocre." After saying that, he went down to the ground and whispered to Zheng under his breath, "Zheng, be one of us with the Dragon Blaze Hall, and I can promise you that you will have a bright future ahead of you. Banding together with us, the finest within the realm, I assure you, would be the best decision you're ever going to make in your lifetime!"</p>

  <p>Knitting his eyebrows, Zheng shot Alan a glance. Indeed, he could feel the power of everyone there, but Alan's way with words made Zheng feel nauseous and totally repulsed, prompting him to ask the person standing close to him, "Who might you be? For what reason should I become a member of the Dragon Blaze Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Aha, who I am is but a trivial matter, what you need to understand is that there are billions of aspiring warriors whose dream is to become part of the Dragon Blaze Hall. Sad to say, the ones who are actually qualified are few and far between! If you were to join our Dragon Blaze Hall, you are going to be destined for greatness, and I'll even throw in an extra 50 drops of Genuine Dragon blood on behalf of our Dragon Blaze Hall!"</p>

  <p>Alan's eyes were already blazing with triumph as he was quite certain that his offer to Zheng would be hard to refuse. For a warrior coming from the Lower World like Zheng, a drop of Genuine Dragon blood was more than sufficient to entice him, and 50 drops, even more so!</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at him and responded with a straight face, "Thank you! I appreciate it! I really do."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, Alan's face brightened up, and he was already grinning much like a Cheshire cat. He was under the assumption that his discernment was on point that the guy on consummation of nature level would be much too thrilled. It couldn't have been further from the truth though, as Alan's smile barely even lasted for a minute.</p>

  <p>Zheng added immediately, "But I'm afraid I can't accept your offer, because I'm not interested in joining the Dragon Blaze Hall."</p>

  <p>"Why is that? 50 drops of Genuine Dragon blood was still inadequate?</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon blood can dramatically increase your blood concentrations! Weren't you aware of that?" Alan blurted out subconsciously, his eyes darkened out of confusion. Zheng's response greatly agitated him, to such an extent that he seemed to have momentarily lost track of the high position he was in as well as his morale, causing him to act far too different from how he usually did.</p>

  <p>"It's not because of the Genuine Dragon blood," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"If not that, then what should matter even more?" Alan pried further with great intensity. His full strength was far greater than Zheng could ever fathom, so there couldn't possibly be anyone who wouldn't be overwhelmed by the power Alan exuded.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't attained the Fighting Soul, Zheng's soul would have been destroyed instantly when faced with such intimidating strength which Alan gave off. However, at that point in time, Zheng had already successfully reached Fighting Soul level, meaning he was capable of resisting such an enormous amount of power with ease.</p>

  <p>"It's quite simple, really. Because I don't appreciate the way you speak to me," Zheng answered in all honesty and then walked directly to the girl wearing palace clothes who just came out of the black ball. He was aware that during the time when he was planning to reach the Fighting Soul level, that girl was the one who helped him, and truth be told, he was actually a man with a heart filled with so much gratefulness.</p>

  <p>"You!" Alan clenched his fists and gritted his teeth as a result, his eyes instantaneously fuming with intense hostility. Oh, how he longed to kill Zheng! That man, Alan, was seething with anger due to Zheng declining his offer to join the Dragon Blaze Hall. To add insult to injury, Zheng even had the nerve to talk to him like that, leaving him downright infuriated.</p>

  <p>Prior to that point, no one had ever found the guts to talk to him that way, so let alone a man of the meager nature level.</p>

  <p>Everyone had heard of Alan's immense power! To Alan, killing Zheng swiftly would be just a piece of cake. However, Zheng had the audacity to humiliate him! How could Alan let that one slip?</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, at that very moment, the words from the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace managed to diffuse Alan's desire to annihilate Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has a point. Since he isn't fond of you, what other reason would he have for joining the Dragon Blaze Hall?" the girl wearing the palace clothes giggled at the scene in front of her.</p>

  <p>The girl's remarks helped Alan get to thinking.</p>

  <p>Alan was actually just a vice leader, and amongst the Dragon Lineage Human, he was significantly much inferior to the girl who was the leader of Dragon Abyss Palace both in position and in power. So, of course, he couldn't just kill Zheng right in front of the girl!</p>

  <p>"I don't know how to thank you enough, Madam. Thanks for lending a helping hand when I was attempting to reach the Fighting Soul level!"</p>

  <p>Zheng leaned over to pay his respects.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha." Hearing Zheng's words of gratitude, the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace merrily roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Madam, you look rather young, akin to a girl of sweet sixteen! Is referring to you as Madam a bit too much?" Zheng clarified, unable to hold back his laughter.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's way of speaking toward their head, elder Wei couldn't help cursing him deeply in his heart, 'This Zheng... such insolence talking about our leader's age casually. Do you have some kind of death wish? Just how badly do you want to get sent straight to the hell?'</p>
