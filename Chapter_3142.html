<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3142 Moving Up The Flow Tower </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone gradually got bored from staring at the motionless golden light dot in the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Thus the arrival of the young man in a coir raincoat and the girl in yellow drew their attention towards them.</p>

  <p>"That's Milo..."</p>

  <p>"He came out today!"</p>

  <p>"He's the most powerful warrior of the Flow Sword Sect. It is known that he is capable of Instant Enlightenment, and can produce the Sword-reading Liquid as much as he wants!"</p>

  <p>"The Sword-reading Liquid is exceedingly expensive. If he sells it, he could earn countless divine crystals."</p>

  <p>The girls in white were struck with awe as their gazes followed Milo.</p>

  <p>Geniuses were always treated with high regard by the girls.</p>

  <p>As for Damien and the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect, they felt inferior to him in his presence.</p>

  <p>Those who resided in the separate courtyard houses were this sect's elite disciples, and Milo was the best among them.</p>

  <p>Every year, the ordinary disciples were allowed to stay in the Flow Tower for twenty hours, while the elite were allowed two hundred hours. However, Milo was the only exception who could stay in the tower as long as he wished!</p>

  <p>That was the highest privilege given to anyone in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>As for the girl walking alongside him, she had a respectful background in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Milo, the glamorous woman put on a seductive smile and asked, "What brings you here, Milo?"</p>

  <p>"It's too boring in the house," Milo replied, shrugging his shoulders casually. Then, his gaze fell on the Flow Tower, and he stared at it with a baffled expression on his face. "Why is there only one person in the Flow Tower? And why is that person still on the first floor?"</p>

  <p>"This person has gotten Poor for two months in a row. What's more, he is the last one of the newcomers. That's why there is only him in the Flow Tower," the glamorous woman explained.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Milo murmured, as he stopped walking.</p>

  <p>The person in the tower seemed to have captured Milo's interest.</p>

  <p>"Milo, there's nothing interesting to watch here. Let's just go..." the girl named Kate beside Milo grumbled in an annoyed voice.</p>

  <p>"Hold on for a bit, I just want to see how long he can hold on. Having gotten Poor in two consecutive months, he must be very agitated now.</p>

  <p>Entering the tower is bound to be a devastating experience for him..." Milo said, gesturing her to stop.</p>

  <p>"But..." Kate still urged him to leave with her.</p>

  <p>Watching this, the glamorous woman said, "He has stayed in the Flow Tower for more than an hour. I guess, within ten minutes, he will be kicked out."</p>

  <p>"Then we might as well wait until he comes out. We're in no hurry anyway,"</p>

  <p>Milo uttered as he grabbed Kate's arm to signal her to stay put.</p>

  <p>Seeing the scene unfold from a distance, Carrie could not help but fantasize about standing beside Milo. She tugged at Trish's arm and whispered, "It would be such an honor if we got the chance to serve Mr. Mo!"</p>

  <p>Trish shook her head and said, "The girl who can stand beside a man like Mr. Mo is by no means an ordinary person. That girl in yellow is not his maid. I heard that she is his fiancee, and that her father is a senior of the Oneness Sky Palace. We are worlds apart from her..."</p>

  <p>"I guess it is true that birth decides fate," Carrie sighed with a pout.</p>

  <p>"What a pity! Mr. Luo has been stuck in there for a long time. It seems that he won't be able to break through." Trish stared at the dot on the surface of the tower with low spirits.</p>

  <p>Trish was different from the other girls. She preferred being closer to reality compared to the others who had a habit of daydreaming. As time passed by, Zheng's hopes of crossing the first floor slowly began to fade away.</p>

  <p>Another five minutes passed with no progress. People outside watched in anticipation. It now seemed more likely that Zheng would soon be kicked out.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng closed his eyes in an attempt to focus and lock all emotions out of his head.</p>

  <p>As he concentrated, he began to slowly dismantle the internal momentum of Emotion Closing Godly Way in his mind.</p>

  <p>In the situation he was now in, he viewed the Emotion Closing Godly Way in a different light as opposed to an offensive technique. He attempted to use it as a special soul theurgy, just like the way he thought of the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>'The most impressive point of the Emotion Closing Godly Way is to abandon all sorts of emotions and launch out a decisive sword attack...</p>

  <p>The Flame of Soul, however, can attack me at one point...</p>

  <p>Wait, when many negative thoughts are lingering in my mind, I can just cut them off!</p>

  <p>I get it now!'</p>

  <p>Feeling enlightened, Zheng suddenly opened his eyes in a flash.</p>

  <p>'Now! Let's go!'</p>

  <p>With his mind made up, Zheng jumped up enthusiastically once more.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped off the ground to head to the second floor, the Flame of Soul reacted to his movements, and he felt the burning sensation in his chest again.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing..."</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed a blinding light as he immediately used the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had predicted, the Flame of Soul reacted and gathered itself at one point and then made its way towards his forehead.</p>

  <p>It was this same move that had caused Zheng to fail previously. However, this time he was prepared!</p>

  <p>The Flame of Soul was capable of attacking him at only one point in his body, and Zheng was ready to defend it.</p>

  <p>When the Flame of Soul broke through the Emotion Closing Godly Way and took advantage of Zheng's obsession to entice his negative emotions, Zheng focused all his internal momentum on a point.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A dangerous battle against conflicting emotions raged on within his body, but it only lasted for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Then, one by one, all the extreme feelings triggered by the flames were slowly extinguished.</p>

  <p>Within a split second, Zheng had successfully reached the second floor of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The Flame of Soul manifested itself into a face again and had a shocked expression at the scene. "Wow, you were so quick to comprehend the theurgy beyond way to deal with me!"</p>

  <p>Because of the existence of the Other Shore, the status of the Godly Ways in the Source World wasn't very high, but a theurgy beyond way was not something that could be easily comprehended. Moreover, Zheng had to bear the pressure of the Flame of Soul in the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Showing no signs of hesitation, Zheng leaped up again!</p>

  <p>Similar to the events that had occurred on the first floor, the Flame of Soul rose from Zheng's chest once more and attempted to attack him at one point in his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing..."</p>

  <p>He did not know what this theurgy beyond way was called, but it was the only method he could use to dispose of the Flame of Soul.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As a white light flashed in his mind, the fire penetrated his mind again.</p>

  <p>However, those negative emotions, like restlessness, failure, and fear, were quickly diffused by the theurgy.</p>

  <p>"The third floor!"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued moving upwards!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, outside the Flow Tower, the onlookers wore different expressions on their faces when they saw Zheng jump up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo! Mr. Luo reached the second floor!" Carrie screamed as she jumped up and down on her toes clapping her hands in excitement!</p>

  <p>"I saw it," Trish replied in a solemn voice, staring at the round golden light dot. As long as Zheng did not fall back to the first floor and walked out of the second-floor door, he wouldn't be expelled.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Trish was a little worried, but suddenly, the golden light dot didn't fall. Instead, it continued to proceed to the third floor!</p>

  <p>"That guy..."</p>

  <p>"He advanced to the third floor already in such a short time?!"</p>

  <p>"How did he get so fast?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Flow Sword Sect all discussed among themselves as they watched the spectacle dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>It seemed that watching Zheng was worth the wait after all. They never expected they would get to see him change course so quickly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you just say this person got the Poor"? Advancing so quickly from the first to the third floor, he by no means is an ordinary man," Milo said while giving an appealing smile. It had nothing to do with him, but he just watched for his entertainment.</p>

  <p>The glamorous woman and her companions were just stunned at the scene.</p>

  <p>"He's still moving up!" someone exclaimed while pointing in the tower's direction.</p>

  <p>The golden light dot on the surface of the Flow Tower leaped up again and reached the fourth floor without a hitch.</p>

  <p>Before anyone had the window to react, the golden light dot danced again and ended up on the fifth floor.</p>

  <p>"The fifth floor? This guy is really something else..."</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Flow Sword Sect hung their heads in defeat. They realized that they wouldn't be able to get Zheng's entry tokens, and it was still hard for them to accept the fact that he had jumped to the fifth floor at such a quick pace.</p>

  <p>Feeling defeated, they looked up to see the golden light dot had already made its way to the sixth floor and was now only one leap away from the seventh.</p>
