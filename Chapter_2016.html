  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2016 Another Giant Phantom </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each time when a supreme world collapsed, only a few creatures would be able to survive.</p>

  <p>Hundreds and thousands of mortals in the cities and surrounding towns had no chance of escaping such a disaster. It was an unforeseen occurrence for them to be prepared.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened. He hadn't expected that such a powerful phantom would suddenly appear at the last moment.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without any remorse, the phantom once again lifted its hand in an attempt to blow another hit towards Zheng. With a gust of wind, a strong pressure resonated.</p>

  <p>With a sudden realization, Zheng's face showed signs of struggle and hesitation. He couldn't think of a better way to deal with this attack. If he didn't block it, then the entire Rosy Cloud World would definitely be destroyed by the phantom's other powerful attack.</p>

  <p>With no time to lose, he was having cold feet caught between choices on how to deal with the attack, but at that moment, he suddenly felt a cold killing intent advancing from behind him!</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way, Zheng!"</p>

  <p>A resolute strong voice shouted from behind him.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around and saw Xun advancing on a fast speed. The bone wings behind Xun's back had fully extended. Each of the bone wings emitted a scarlet light.</p>

  <p>Xun had already completely recovered her strength after unsealing her Pool of Faith. Using Ying's spirit embryo, she became even stronger than she had been in the past! She was originally the strongest person of the Demon Night race. After the three queens took each of their own positions, the powers of their Faith Energy were different as well.</p>

  <p>Ying's Faith Energy represented new life and fraternity. Her green Faith Energy transformed was the power of Life Law. Yao's Faith Energy represented rules and order. It would then be transformed into the power of Thunder Law. Those who violated the rules and order of the race would be punished by thunder.</p>

  <p>As for Xun's Faith Energy, it represented destruction and annihilation. Her Faith Energy was actually a fusion of the Demon Night race members' malicious aura. It gave her an excellent and advanced skill in killing.</p>

  <p>With Xun's fighting strength and acquired power, she had far surpassed Yao.</p>

  <p>The blood-red Faith Energy she absorbed contained an intense aura of killing. The scarlet lights on her bone wings constantly fluctuated as they converged onto the Saint Killing Spear in Xun's hands, forming spear shadows that surrounded her weapon.</p>

  <p>As Xun brandished the Saint Killing Spear, the spear shadows that seemed to be solid began to sway along with the spear.</p>

  <p>"Converge!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As she ordered, the spear shadows began to converge on the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the Saint Killing Spear, the demonic red color had reached its saturation point. Traces of malicious aura were like flames slowly spreading out to its surroundings.</p>

  <p>At the time when Zheng blocked the first attack of the phantom's transparent giant hand, Xun on the side had already begun preparing this skill.</p>

  <p>With a wave of her slender bone wings, they changed their circular formation and swiftly retracted below her back. She then raised the saint spear above her head. Her slender body seemed to have become one with the spear.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Her body shot into the sky like a rocket.</p>

  <p>Despite knowing that the power of the phantom's giant hand was incomparably strong, Xun's figure was like a thin needle which instantly pierced through the transparent hand!</p>

  <p>After she passed through the transparent giant hand, the formless energy inside the hand began to surge out from the hole.</p>

  <p>"She's so powerful!" Seeing this scene, Zheng couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p>

  <p>Xun's strike was probably no different from the full-power attack of a mid-rank Supreme Lord. It seemed to have caused some damage to the giant phantom!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Xun swiftly made a turn in the air and a second time flew back towards the giant phantom. Her speed was astoundingly fast, and in the blink of an eye, she had once again pierced through the phantom's chest and drilled out from its back.</p>

  <p>The giant phantom's speed on the other hand was not slow either. Its two hands stretched out, wanting to get a hold of Xun. In the end, its speed appeared to be slower than Xun's, failing to catch her in several consecutive attempts.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Relying on her extremely fast speed, Xun was like a red shuttle which flew back and forth in the air, inflicting multiple wounds on the giant phantom's body.</p>

  <p>With nothing it could do against Xun, the giant phantom just twisted its enormous body and cried out in pain.</p>

  <p>"Awoooo..."</p>

  <p>Left with a last attempt, the giant phantom raised its hands and suddenly let out a deafening roar. The roar released a majestic strong aura!</p>

  <p>As the formidable aura spread out, whether it was Zheng, or Leroy and Xun, all of them immediately felt an extreme sense of oppression, as if someone had struck them on the head with a metal hammer.</p>

  <p>Xun, who was originally flying at a high speed, suddenly felt dizzy.</p>

  <p>She was unable to maintain her balance making her struggle and sway on the air.</p>

  <p>The giant phantom reached out its hand grabbing her body at an extremely fast speed. Its other hand was raised up in attempt to slam down onto Xun's head!</p>

  <p>The strength of the giant phantom was beyond imagination. With a sudden slam of its hand, even a supreme world would be shattered to pieces. If it were to slam onto Xun's body, she would definitely be crushed into a pile of meat paste!</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Fear flashed across Zheng's face. It was nearly impossible to save Xun from the hands of the giant phantom.</p>

  <p>Xun had just managed to get her physical body, and seized back her Pool of Faith. He hadn't even talked much with her, but now he would have to watch her die in front of him... His state of mind was in total chaos, and his intense emotions made his soul tremble unceasingly.</p>

  <p>Leroy also had a look of despair on his face. Their attack on the Inauguration Altar had been a series of twists and turns. To the point of being despaired earlier, they had been given a ray of hope witnessing Xun's revival and had seen her take control of the situation. But now, the situation suddenly turned against them once more.</p>

  <p>As for Yao, under the feet of the giant phantom, showed a big smile and anticipation on her face.</p>

  <p>The Soul-sealing Needle was in fact not a symbol of slavery. In truth, the three queens had been in a semi-controlled state. The Soul-sealing Needle could change their minds to a certain degree, but it hadn't controlled them completely.</p>

  <p>As the Soul-sealing Needle released more and more memories into their souls, Yao gradually understood Murphy's plan.</p>

  <p>Relying with only the power of the Demon Night race, they weren't much of a threat to the Evolutionary Universe. They had been distracted by the ogres and weren't able to offer much help to the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>However, once the Soul-sealing Needle in the queens' souls broke, it would be able to summon a phantom of Murphy.</p>

  <p>The phantom was in fact a method for Murphy to come here.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the giant phantom was greatly reduced after it descended on the Evolutionary Universe, it still possessed the strength of a True God. This was also one of the Demon Night race's trump cards!</p>

  <p>However, this trump card could only be used three times. It was first used when the Soul-sealing Needle in Xun's soul had been destroyed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The second one was used by Yao in order to kill Xun.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Kill her!" Yao no longer cared about the situation in the Evolutionary Universe. All she wanted right now was to see Xun die in front of her.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng felt as if time slowed down...</p>

  <p>He could see Xun using all her power and strength to wiggle out from the giant's palm. Beneath her elegant eyebrows, her beautiful eyes were shining with determination and boldness. She might have already realized that she would not be able to escape, but after entering her fighting mode, she was affected by the malicious aura and couldn't feel any fears.</p>

  <p>In the midst of struggle, her eyes met Zheng's. She realized something but only looked at him with a hint of regret.</p>

  <p>Her regretful gaze contained too many unspoken implications, creeping through Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>That moment seemed to have turned into eternity, and everything became increasingly slower in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Zoom!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly at the same time, everything came to a halt as Zheng felt a gust of cold wind blew past his back. A figure of a person, in a flash, appeared behind him. The figure quickly grew in size and soon turned into another giant phantom. Without wasting any second, it waved its giant fist and blew a strike towards Murphy's phantom.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound could be heard as Murphy's phantom was thrown to the ground. It was not able to hurt Xun with just a mere gap of seconds.</p>

  <p>Being attacked by another oppression, it lost balance throwing Xun up into the sky.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Murphy's phantom fell heavily to the ground and crushed the Inauguration Altar behind it creating numerous cracks and canyons on the ground. These cracks were enough to disrupt the stability of the entire Rosy Cloud World. The entire supreme world continued to shake.</p>

  <p>It seemed like it might collapse at any moment!</p>

  <p>The giant phantom behind Zheng only threw one punch but the effect was beyond expectation. It was not just on par with Murphy's phantom but could be even more powerful!</p>

  <p>"This, this..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was dumbstruck as he stared at the giant phantom behind him.</p>

  <p>This phantom had appeared once in the past, and it was this figure who had helped him destroy all of the Luck-devouring Snakes the time he encountered the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation. He had never imagined that this figure would suddenly appear once more and even gave a powerful blow to Murphy's phantom.</p>
