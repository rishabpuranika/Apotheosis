  <p>
</p>

  <p>The huge tail appeared out of nowhere, and by the time Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven realized what was happening, it was too late to try to dodge it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In a single blow, both of them were struck and smashed into the depths of the ground.</p>

  <p>The gigantic creature floating in the sky was no other than Gerald!</p>

  <p>Earlier, Othniel had sent him to a desolate place in the chaos. However, he exhausted all his means to rush to the Separate Amber Province. Upon his return, he immediately rushed to help Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"You can go. I'll deal with them."</p>

  <p>Gerald's voice boomed loudly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you can't deal with them alone," replied Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Gerald looked at Fuxi confusedly. He didn't know that Othniel had been caught by the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The moment those words left his mouth, a violent pain shot up from his tail.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a wisp of dark red flame erupted from the surface of Gerald's tail.</p>

  <p>Before Gerald had the time to react, his entire tail was burnt to a crisp by the flame.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Claire's body began to transform rapidly, growing until she became a massive giant of flames. Her beautiful face was no longer visible; instead, raging flames took its place. "I didn't expect to meet such trouble when I descended the first time," she said in a muffled voice. "Well then, let's finish this once and for all!"</p>

  <p>The arrival of the Grandmaster of Heaven had been part of the Black Ship's plan all along, but Claire's arrival was just an alternative plan for Yellow Thearch. Even the Yellow Thearch himself was strongly opposed to the way Claire occupied his body.</p>

  <p>However, as the situation changed, the Yellow Thearch was unable to resist the enemy and finally chose to compromise. Therefore, Claire rushed in hastily, not knowing what to expect. She never thought she'd encounter so much trouble.</p>

  <p>The series of unfortunate events finally exhausted her patience. In that moment, she decided she would get rid of all these problems, once and for all.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A line of flames appeared in the distance and spread towards them at an incredible speed. It was almost as though the flames weren't traveling through space!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the flames had shrouded half of the Separate Amber Province and even part of the province nearby.</p>

  <p>"Element Destruction!</p>

  <p>Let everything here disappear!"</p>

  <p>Claire rolled her shoulders backwards and lifted her arms to the sky, roaring at the top of her lungs.</p>

  <p>Then, ice blue lightning flashed around her. Countless streaks of lightning lit up the sky, illuminating the world below.</p>

  <p>Countless flames like red-hot clouds rained down, followed by ice spears of a few hundred thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>Claire was, after all, a fire spirit comprised of countless more fire spirits.</p>

  <p>The members of the Element Spirit race who had reached the same level as Claire could activate the Element Destruction with their clansmen's help.</p>

  <p>All the element energies in the area would become chaotic. When the Element Destruction was displayed, it could destroy everything in the area.</p>

  <p>This was one of the most powerful theurgies of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Claire's plan was very simple. Zheng's body could absorb almost all the energies, which meant he'd come out of this alive. The Element Destruction, however, would kill all the other irrelevant fellows in one go.</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven saw what was happening, his face turned pale. What was Claire doing? Had she gone mad? Generally speaking, the Element Spirit race rarely ever used Element Destruction.</p>

  <p>The members of the Element Spirit race didn't have physical bodies. They were all creatures formed from elements. Thus, the Element Destruction would consume their bodies. The risk was just too great.</p>

  <p>Within the range of Element Destruction, Gerald was the largest and the first to feel its attacks.</p>

  <p>Initially, Gerald didn't take it seriously. Although its destructive power was astonishing, it was easy to display such power if the Eternal Realm warriors used their bloodline to the extreme.</p>

  <p>Gerald was under the impression that the Element Destruction was on the same level as the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.</p>

  <p>With his outstanding healing ability, it was useless even if ten strong warriors on the same level as Emperor Charm used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy simultaneously.</p>

  <p>However, when the flames licked at Gerald's body, he began to feel something was wrong.</p>

  <p>While his black shell was extremely solid, the flames were causing cracks to form on it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the flames only lasted a moment, but the lightning bolts were like countless little earthworms that drilled into his body ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A bright green light was released from Gerald's body. The wounds inside and outside his body quickly healed. His tail, which had been cut off by Claire, also regenerated.</p>

  <p>However, the Element Destruction kept on attacking. Claire was going to stop at nothing until everything in this area was destroyed.</p>

  <p>A larger size would definitely attract more attacks. After Gerald realized this, his body began to shrink rapidly. He turned into a black scorpion the size of a person and rushed towards Claire.</p>

  <p>As a Chaos Ancient God who controlled the truth of life, Gerald had the ability to create lives and conversely, destroy lives. The latter involved poisons.</p>

  <p>However, these poisons were completely different from the usual ones. The poison surging through Gerald's yellow and green tail was called the Poison of Decomposition.</p>

  <p>This type was so lethal that it could poison not only creatures, but also substances.</p>

  <p>Once the substances, including those things without forms like souls and energies, were infected with the Poison of Decomposition, they would, as the name implied, start decomposing immediately.</p>

  <p>Even if Claire was now in the form of a fire giant, Gerald still had the potential to defeat her.</p>

  <p>However, before Gerald could even get close, the energy of Element Destruction swept towards him like a snowstorm, forcing him to take a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven had already summoned the Six Soul Flags. At the same time, he placed the Cyan Misty Sword in front of him with a pair of golden scissors in his hand.</p>

  <p>Flood dragons twined around the scissors, flashing a dazzlingly bright gold.</p>

  <p>It was another magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven: the Golden Dragon Scissors.</p>

  <p>It could cut through almost anything, even energy.</p>

  <p>However, the power of the Element Destruction gradually increased. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was still able to resist it, he knew he had to do something drastic if he wanted to make it out of this alive.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were at a disadvantage. Although the two of them were working together, their strength was relatively weak compared to the others. Their only advantage was Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi stood in front of the Snake Goddess and placed Zheng in front of him. At the same time, the Snake Goddess used her shadow to form a circular enchanted barrier to protect them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi kept turning around, trying his best to use Zheng as a shield to block the energy.</p>

  <p>However, the attacks came from all directions. There was no way he'd be able to block all of them.</p>

  <p>The slightest mistake could cause the Snake Goddess's enchanted barrier to collapse, rendering them vulnerable to the attacks of the Element Destruction.</p>
