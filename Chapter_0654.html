  <p>
</p>

  <p>These obelisks could be dated back to ancient times. The words on them were engraved by master cultivators from the Genuine Dragons, as they had a better understanding of laws than mortals.</p>

  <p>Cultivators from the Lower World could not compete with them in terms of comprehension of laws. Thus, these obelisks were placed here to help Dragon Lineage Humans from the Lower World to improve their understanding of laws.</p>

  <p>Among the varieties of laws, the fundamentals included Fire Law, Wind Law, Time Law, Space Law, and so forth. Laws evolved from these fundamentals were numerous, for example, the Artistic Mountain Conception was an evolution of the Earth Law, and the Heavenly Law was a satori from both the nature and Metal Law by weapon refiners.</p>

  <p>Cultivators had varying affinities with different laws. Luo Luo Zheng had chosen an obelisk that recorded information about the Space Law to cultivate. Elder Wei believed that Luo Luo Zheng had enough affinity with the Space Law, which would aid in his understanding and cultivation.</p>

  <p>Watching the events unfold in front of him, Elder Wei found that he had been wrong. His theory was far from the truth.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned their eyes to the top of Luo Zheng's obelisk, including the cultivators who were still attached to other obelisks. No one could stop staring.</p>

  <p>Such a strange thing had never happened before, at least in their lifetime.</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused, even Elder Wei. After thinking for a while, he finally realized that it was the legendary baptism by laws. As for other people present, they had never heard about the baptism by laws, and hence, they could not figure out what was happening!</p>

  <p>All they could see was that the obelisk was constantly shaking, and the Law Power continuously converging toward Luo Luo Zheng. Every cultivator envied him.</p>

  <p>What was worse, as the obelisks were shaking so wildly, some cultivators' souls could not stay attached to their obelisks. Most of them had struggled to reach a safe place on the obelisks. Some cultivators were not so lucky. As the shaking continued, more and more cultivators' souls were knocked down. This was definitely a horrible accident.</p>

  <p>Since baptism by laws was not a mystery for the elders, Zack Zhao also figured out what was happening. "Baptism by laws...it has not happened for so many years."</p>

  <p>Baptism by laws would not improve the strength of a cultivator. As a result, even though Luo Luo Zheng was experiencing it, his strength and cultivation would not be boosted. Baptism by laws was simply a way to increase a cultivator's affinities with laws.</p>

  <p>Cultivators were born with affinities for certain laws to some extent.</p>

  <p>Some had close affinities with the Thunder Law, while others had special affinities with the Wind Law. And Luo Luo Zheng, a typical example, showed his close affinity with Space Law by achieving a little power of Space Law through space transmission.</p>

  <p>What was more, after going through the baptism by laws, his affinities would be increased for all laws. That was to say, if Luo Luo Zheng were to cultivate the Thunder Law or Fire Law, he would not meet many troubles.</p>

  <p>This was a gift. If a cultivator wanted to get a baptism of laws, he or she had no choice but to wait for the chance.</p>

  <p>Zack and Wei had been Elders for many years. All the information they had about baptism by laws came from other people. Unfortunately, neither of them had seen such an event.</p>

  <p>They would never have imagined that such a miracle would happen and that Luo Luo Zheng would receive the gift.</p>

  <p>Christopher was among the cultivators. He was now securely attached to his obelisk and staring at Luo Luo Zheng with hatred. Although he didn't get a chance to figure out what was happening, what he did know was that Luo Luo Zheng had taken center stage.</p>

  <p>Christopher was born into a noble family with noble blood. And the blood of the Genuine Dragon in his body was the richest in his whole family. Even his ancestors could not compete with him. He had been the focus of everyone's attention ever since he was born. People envied him from his childhood. As soon as he reached the age of twenty, Christopher was sent to the Dragon Soar Arena. He was supposed to fly to the Upper World and become a member of the great race? the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Christopher thought that even though he was now one of the Dragon Lineage Humans, he would still be a privileged person, who would be surrounded by praise and envy. However, something happened that was beyond his expectation. As a new cultivator here, he had not shown his talent yet, and everyone's attention had been focused on this young man in front of him. Luo Luo Zheng had stolen his spotlight!</p>

  <p>How could Christopher tolerate this?</p>

  <p>But he knew there was nothing he could do about it. Christopher couldn't even climb the obelisk of the Space Law. Was he eligible to judge?</p>

  <p>Christopher gritted his teeth and refused to focus on the unfairness of this situation. He continued to cultivate the Law Power from the obelisk because he was determined not to lose to anyone!</p>

  <p>Standing on the high peak of the obelisk, Luo Luo Zheng silently received the baptism from the Law Power. Although the Law Power was continually washing his soul, he didn't feel much. As the baptism continued, Luo Luo Zheng sensed a connection with these obelisks. But this was not the actual state.</p>

  <p>To be more accurate, it was a connection between Luo Luo Zheng and the Law Powers!</p>

  <p>"It seems... these obelisks are calling me..." Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>He didn't summon his soul to his body until the Law Power finished the baptism. He opened his eyes and stood slowly. Something had changed.</p>

  <p>"M-Mr... I don't know your name, my friend." As soon as Luo Luo Zheng stood, Elder Wei quickly approached Luo Luo Zheng, with a warm smile on his face. His attitude towards Luo Luo Zheng had changed from before.</p>

  <p>Previously, Elder Wei didn't take Luo Luo Zheng seriously because he was not a clansman of the Dragon Lineage, but a stowaway who only had a few drops of flood dragon's blood in his body. Moreover, according to the rules, he would be imprisoned for a thousand years.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was lucky as the landlord had asked Elder Wei to take care of him.</p>

  <p>That was why Elder Wei had broken the rules and gave a drop of Genuine Dragon's blood to Luo Luo Zheng to protect him from being imprisoned.</p>

  <p>"You don't even know his name? So he could not have been a member of your Dragon Abyss Palace, right? That's great! My friend, are you interested in joining our Dragon Blaze Hall? There are 9, 316 halls and 1, 300 palaces here. We are confident that Dragon Blaze Hall can make it to the top 200! If you join us, I can bet that you will do well in the future!" Zack said, with a big smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Zack was unfamiliar with Luo Zheng's potential and talent, and both his cultivation and strength were not insignificant. Zack only wanted to recruit Luo Luo Zheng because the laws had baptized him.</p>

  <p>After all, baptism by laws could be very helpful in his further cultivation.</p>

  <p>In the future, Luo Luo Zheng would have close affinities with any laws, which meant that he would not face obstacles when cultivating laws! Zack had been guiding cultivators from the Lower World for numerous years. He had tremendous experience in identifying and selecting good cultivators.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew the importance of baptism by laws!</p>

  <p>After hearing Zack's proposal, Elder Wei's face darkened. He said coldly,</p>

  <p>"Zack, this friend has consumed a drop of Genuine Dragon's blood from the Dragon Abyss Palace. Isn't it quite impolite for you to poach him from us? I think you should know that we are not easy to mess with!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! No wonder the blood of the Genuine Dragon inside him is weak. It turns out that Dragon Abyss Palace has merely given him a drop of Genuine Dragon's blood! How generous you are!" Zack smiled ironically and continued, "My friend, if you join Dragon Blaze Hall, I will give you ten drops of Genuine Dragon's blood right now. What do you think? It's a great deal, right?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Leave him alone. We are not so stingy. After I report your achievement to our supervisor, you will get everything you want. Ten drops of Genuine Dragon's blood are not worth speaking of." Not to be outdone, Elder Wei fought back.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't intended to join any party when he flew to the Genuine Dragon World from the Dragon Soar Arena. However, the rules seemed not to work like that. Luo Luo Zheng had to choose one party, and it was hard for him to resist the temptation being offered to him. Luo Luo Zheng had previously thought of completing the trials here and then returning to the Central Region as there were still many issues that needed to be worked out, especially saving Yan, who was the most important person in his life.</p>

  <p>He had not expected things to go in a different direction. Before him stood two Elders, scrabbling to secure him for their group.</p>

  <p>'Ten drops of Genuine Dragon's blood...' Only one drop was enough for Luo Luo Zheng to feel a dramatic change in his blood and veins. If he consumed ten drops of blood, the change would be more fierce than Luo Luo Zheng could imagine.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng nodded to Elder Wei, "Sir, my name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. As I was in a hurry, I couldn't tell you my name in time. It's my fault. Please forgive me."</p>

  <p>After hearing his reply, the warm smile returned to Elder Wei's face. "Of course I forgive you, my friend. Luo Luo Zheng is a good name! Now that you have succeeded in the challenge of your obelisk, and are lucky to have ranked as an elite, you are qualified to take the next trial. Since you have just received the baptism by laws, you can also choose to cultivate laws on other obelisks. The choice is yours..."</p>

  <p>"I would like to cultivate other laws first," Luo Luo Zheng said promptly. He had now realized that the phenomenon he had endured was called baptism by laws.</p>

  <p>As he was going through the baptism by laws, Luo Luo Zheng felt a strong desire to cultivate the other obelisks. But he couldn't do that before because of the restrictions. Now, there was no reason for him to miss the chance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Elder Wei ignored Zack and continued to have a pleasant conversation. Zack's face darkened as he was in a bad mood.</p>
