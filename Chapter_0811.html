<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 811 The Ogre War Lord (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng had witnessed his family getting killed in a vicious plot and had gone into a state of decline when he was young. The upheaval had left a scar in his mind and he had been unable to find himself for quite a while. However, that did not necessarily mean he had become a cold-hearted man.</p>

  <p>To be honest, he had never expected that after comprehending the consummate sword intent, he would, one day, enter the Killing Sword Mountain and set on a path to cultivate in the killing way.</p>

  <p>However, even after cultivating in the killing way, Zheng had not accumulated too much malicious aura in the Central Region. Because he was not a bloodthirsty man by nature. He never killed his opponent unless the latter wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, in this chaotic continent, Zheng wasn't too worried about killing his enemies since they were not humans. The ogres he were facing were an alien race and wouldn't have hesitated to kill him.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly pulled out a sword in his hand, which was a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Waves of sword intent swirled in the air as it shot towards the ogres like a flying shuttle.</p>

  <p>If one were to compare the bodies of the ogres to that of eagles, then Zheng's figure was like a nimble skylark, quickly shuttling back and forth among his prey. He would slightly brush past his enemies and the next moment, they were finished. The ogres fell one after another, hitting the ground with hard, thudding noises, their eyes still wide open in surprise. As they breathed their last breaths, they were all wondering about the human in front of them with puzzlement, trying to understand how a seventh level war fighter could be so strong.</p>

  <p>In an instant, half of the hundred or so ogres Zheng was facing fell down and bit the dust. And they were not just guard dogs. In fact, the ones who had been killed first were the elites of the ogre race who were eighth level or ninth level war fighters. But somehow, this human was killing them like a farmer would harvest rice. They were nothing right now.</p>

  <p>Unable to contain himself any longer, the ogre war general let out a furious roar, with a forceful energy bursting out from his huge body in his anger. A pair of huge bronze hammers appeared in his hands, which he brandished and charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng had smashed the fifth level ogre war general to death. The ogre war general he was facing now was a level higher and definitely more powerful. But that one level did not do the ogre general any good. Faced with the pair of bronze hammers that were bigger than his own self, Zheng slightly waved the long sword in his hand and chopped the hammers in halves.</p>

  <p>After all, that bronze hammers were probably low grade fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>How could they withstand the long sword which was a sacred weapon in Zheng's hand?</p>

  <p>When the humans in the forest saw that the sword in Zheng's hand had chopped the hammers in halves, they were completely stunned. "Is that a sacred weapon that he is holding?"</p>

  <p>"Man! I didn't know that he is so rich! You know, he's merely a seventh level war fighter, but he has obtained a sacred weapon. Oh, my god! I think it's entirely possible that he's some master from a sacred place," the bearded middle-aged man remarked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"A seventh level war fighter? You're right. His cultivation base is indeed only at the seventh level of a war fighter. but what he has just exhibited gives me the impression that he is a lot more powerful than that. He just smashed a fifth level ogre war general to pieces, so there's no way we can gauge his strength using common sense or knowledge," the silver-haired young man coldly replied.</p>

  <p>Of course Zheng himself had no idea what other people were saying about him. After slicing apart the ogre war general's bronze hammers with a swift and simple move, his figure suddenly flashed. A beam of milky white light suddenly burst out from the forceful energy on his body. The next moment, his entire body seemed to turn into a fine, long thread, which charged straight towards the ogre general!</p>

  <p>The speed was somehow strange to him.</p>

  <p>In fact, sensing this speed, a trace of astonishment flickered in Zheng's own eyes too. Boosted by the forceful energy, his speed seemed to have increased several folds. He was now moving so fast that he felt like he wouldn't be able to control his own movements. To avoid bumping into the ogre war general, he slightly tilted the sword in his hand, which was about to stab into the body of the ogre war general. As a result, the sword realigned and grazed the ogre war general's neck, cutting it wide open.</p>

  <p>When the blood began to splash out from the wound on the ogre war general's neck, Zheng's figure had already disappeared without a trace. He had lost control of his own speed and crashed head-on into a small hill far away...</p>

  <p>Even the ogre general hadn't expected that Zheng's speed could reach such an unimaginable extent. He clutched his severed neck and heavily fell to the ground, finished for good.</p>

  <p>All the other ogres were transfixed with shock. Right after Zheng disappeared before their very eyes, they saw a cloud of dust rise from the hill in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That guy... How did he gain such a velocity in an instant?" A human hidden in the forest could not help ejaculating in shock.</p>

  <p>"Hush, keep it down. It is indeed very strange. His speed suddenly increased, and even he himself was unable to come to a halt in time," the bearded middle-aged man remarked with confusion written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Actually, they weren't the only ones who felt that it was strange. The ogres were also confused, and even Zheng himself didn't have a clue about what had just happened.</p>

  <p>When the forceful energy had burst out from his body, his speed had increased so much that it felt like he was riding on a storm cloud.</p>

  <p>He looked at his body, trying to figure out what had contributed to the sudden increase in his speed. The Phoenix Crystal which was embedded in his arm was no longer of much use for increasing his speed, since he had already achieved a much higher velocity. Therefore, he guessed that it could not have been the Phoenix Crystal that had caused the boost in his speed just now.</p>
