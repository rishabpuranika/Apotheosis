<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not have any ill feelings towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>The two of them had hardly interacted.</p>

  <p>But now that Nathan had spoken to Mu Ning like that, it meant he had ignored Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had not married him, but she was still his girl.</p>

  <p>There were many ways in which Luo Luo Zheng could be magnanimous. But how could he bear others lusting after his girl?</p>

  <p>"How ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, who was slowly floating up onto the stone, pursed her lips and said.</p>

  <p>She didn't believe Nathan's explanation of fate for a minute, but she was still a little panicked. She was afraid that her fate would take the path that Nathan had predicted.</p>

  <p>Nathan had just predicted her fate according to the situation on the Heaven Earth Board but he hadn't talked about Luo Zheng's fate. If what he said was true, what would happen to Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>"It's just a madman babbling his mad talk. Don't take his words to heart,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm not taking it to heart," Mu Ning said, winking at him. She'd been afraid that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be happy. But watching his relaxed expression relieved her to no end.</p>

  <p>How could she have known what went on in a man's mind? In many ways, a man had to bear a lot of pressure, but this was intolerable.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked relaxed, but he had already made up his mind to kill Nathan.</p>

  <p>The first battle had ended with Mu Ning admitting defeat, but since it was not an elimination battle, there were still eleven people.</p>

  <p>Soon, the second battle began.</p>

  <p>Just as Nathan had guessed, the two stones for the second battle had been chosen in a baffling manner. What was more, they were in different directions and neither of the fighters had been eliminated.</p>

  <p>At this stage, many of the winners and losers were crucial. But the black and white sides did not tangle with each other. Instead, they began to arrange their territories once again.</p>

  <p>This battle was one between Lawson and the ogre warrior Parker. Parker was the only Godly Genius of the ogres.</p>

  <p>The clash between the Godly Geniuses was usually extremely fierce.</p>

  <p>They were just one step away from acquiring a Godly Plate, so they were careful.</p>

  <p>Although Lawson was extremely powerful, Parker was also a Godly Genius. Both sides were on guard.</p>

  <p>But once both sides fell to the board, each waited for the other side to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>The truth was, if either side were to admit defeat, it might have had an effect on the entire game, but not much of an impact on themselves.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors who had come to this stage did not want to lose their momentum.</p>

  <p>Lawson had initially been arrogant. He knew that Nathan was stronger than him, but he was still willing to scheme and kill him. So how could he admit defeat now?</p>

  <p>Parker, on the other hand, was an ogre Godly Genius who saw admitting defeat as even more of a humiliation.</p>

  <p>The two sides remained in a stalemate for quite a while before they made a move.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that two Godly Geniuses had crossed swords.</p>

  <p>Lawson pulled out the Wolf Teeth Shadow, the supreme divine weapon of the Lie Clan. This was a divine weapon ranked 11th on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>Parker wasn't weak either. There weren't many talents among the ogres and Parker was the most breathtaking one.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, these two Godly Geniuses were well aware that the fiercer the battle became, the more advantageous it would be for the nine other warriors.</p>

  <p>If the next round turned out to be an elimination round and one of these two was chosen again, the one who had exposed their trump cards in this fight would have low chances of victory in the elimination round.</p>

  <p>Halfway through the fight, Lawson had succeeding in suppressing Parker.</p>

  <p>Parker was unwilling to admit defeat, but he had to do it if he wanted to conserve his strength.</p>

  <p>This battle was Lawson's victory.</p>

  <p>And just as the two of them had feared, the third battle turned out to be an elimination battle and Parker was chosen again.</p>

  <p>When Parker was pressed onto the Heaven Earth Board once again, the ogre warriors started cursing loudly.</p>

  <p>When Parker had admitted defeat, the ogre warriors had believed that it was certain that he would enter the top ten. After all, Parker's chances of being chosen consecutively weren't high. And if someone else were to leave in the elimination battle, Parker would obtain a Godly Plate without fail.</p>

  <p>But they hadn't expected Parker to be chosen to fight again moments after he had admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>And he was facing an elimination battle!</p>

  <p>His opponent was now Kurt, a young monk with fair skin and an unremarkable appearance. Kurt was the only Godly Genius of the Blessed Buddha Land, the reincarnated prodigy of the Hidden Spirit Temple.</p>

  <p>There were very few martial artists in this world who could figure out the mysteries of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>When most martial artists reincarnated, their memories were usually completely erased.</p>

  <p>As the greatest temple in the universe, the prodigy had all sorts of powerful people within it.</p>

  <p>Kurt had been reincarnated and had begun to circle the lap while he was still in the womb. He had absorbed the nature life energy and had been born with the ability to speak. He had started cultivating when he was three months old and broke through to the nature level at the age of one.</p>

  <p>Kurt didn't speak much and didn't have much of a presence. Very few people paid attention to him.</p>

  <p>If the strength of the Godly Geniuses were to be ranked, it was obvious that Kurt would be at the bottom of the list. Many people thought he was only a bit stronger than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Parker had been unhappy at first, but on discovering that his opponent was this little monk, his spirits rose. He thought that personally eliminating this little monk would be pretty good.</p>

  <p>But no one would have thought this white, clean little monk to be capable enough to use a Buddhist light to kill Parker in thirty seconds. It seemed to be too easy for him.</p>

  <p>This caused all other Godly Geniuses to grow wary. Kurt had the power to crush a Godly Genius!</p>

  <p>In the Hidden Spirit Temple, Buddhist light shone everywhere, and incense wafted about.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the Blessed Buddha Land were also watching the battle within the painting.</p>

  <p>On the main peak of the Hidden Spirit Temple, tens of thousands of monks sat cross-legged in a giant square-shaped formation in a hall before the main peak. Some of the monks had their eyes closed, but a majority of them were staring at the painting on the ceiling of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Kurt won against the ogre Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>"It's just an ogre Godly Genius. There's no need to be arrogant. Kurt's goal is to be in the top three. Even the Xuanyuan Clan's Godly Genius can be defeated!"</p>

  <p>"Amitabha! Everyone, don't forget that you're all monks. You can't resent others."</p>

  <p>The Hidden Spirit Temple was the holy temple of the Blessed Buddha Land. All other temples were controlled by the Hidden Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was a very powerful force in the universe, but it remained low-key and rarely participated in the struggles of the outside world. For the past few years, the monks of the Hidden Spirit Temple had been recuperating. The Hidden Spirit Mountain gave off a mysterious Mu Ning to outsiders.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the ogres were now growling and cursing even more fiercely.</p>

  <p>Their only ogre Godly Genius had been just a step away from acquiring a Godly Plate. And yet, he had been eliminated just before that.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder they had become so depressed.</p>

  <p>Apart from Shania, all of the other warriors on the painting were human.</p>

  <p>And the ogre warriors were finding it difficult to accept this result.</p>

  <p>Some of the ogre world lords, in order to express their dissatisfaction, had even used extremely precious Roaring Tokens and roared at the entire universe.</p>

  <p>But no matter how dissatisfied they were, they could only stare and do nothing.</p>

  <p>Once the ogre warrior was eliminated, the remaining ten warriors would each receive a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>Everyone rejoiced, but they knew that they had to work hard to advance to the top three.</p>

  <p>The next warrior who had been chosen to fight was Lone. And his opponent was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lone was the first to be pushed onto the board. When he saw the giant hand grab Luo Luo Zheng, he smiled with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"My luck isn't bad. I have been waiting for this moment for a very long time," Lone said as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lone had suffered a huge loss in the Hall of Causality thanks to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was worried that someone else would eliminate Luo Luo Zheng before he got the chance. But who would've thought that he would run into Luo Luo Zheng in this battle?</p>

  <p>It was a pity that he wasn't the one who had fought with Luo Luo Zheng in the previous round. Even if he defeated and killed Luo Luo Zheng now, Luo Luo Zheng would still be able to obtain a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>At Lone's words, Luo Luo Zheng merely smiled and pulled out the Saint Killing Spear. He knew that he had to be careful while he fought a Godly Genius.</p>
