<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2648 You Can't Pass </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man raised his head and clasped his hands together as he replied with sincerity, "You're right. Our race is indeed facing a crucial enemy invasion."</p>

  <p>The young man that stood on top of the tombstone chuckled.</p>

  <p>"By enemies, you mean the exiles in this world, right?" "Yes," the old man nodded.</p>

  <p>"You came to ask for my help. Is that right?" the young man asked again.</p>

  <p>The old man sighed to himself and could only nod in response.</p>

  <p>That young man might have looked crazy, but his strength sure was immeasurably compelling. Most importantly, he didn't get imprisoned in that world like the exiles.</p>

  <p>Instead, he just showed up in the space where the Warden race resided.</p>

  <p>The old man had no clue why his master arranged such an encounter.</p>

  <p>The young man had been their neighbor for countless years. Maybe he wanted to help them for that reason.</p>

  <p>"The old monster's Strength Equalizing token is really powerful. Even I am affected by it, so I am no different than any ordinary warrior now.</p>

  <p>My assistance might not make any difference," the young man smiled, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, a complicated expression crept up on the old man's face. All of a sudden, he bent his legs and knelt before the young man.</p>

  <p>"I ask you to please help our race," the old man said. The man with purple hair immediately grew anxious when he saw their leader kneel.</p>

  <p>"Sir!" he called out.</p>

  <p>Since the man had already mentioned about his cultivation base being weakened due to the Strength Equalizing token, he wondered why their leader still had to beg him like that. However, the old man's gesture didn't change the expression on the young man's face.</p>

  <p>He then jumped off the tombstone and walked straight to the old man as he clicked his tongue in annoyance, "I made a bet with Herbert in the past, which is why I've been imprisoned in this world for trillions of years. Up to this day, I still couldn't figure it out."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, both the old man and the man with purple hair were taken aback. They were surprised to know that he was also a prisoner of that world.</p>

  <p>In that case, he was an enemy of the Warden race. If he were to offer his help, it only meant that he was doing it for the selfish reason of escaping.</p>

  <p>After making such judgment, the old man and the man with purple hair grew in fear. The tomb keeper noticed the change in their expressions.</p>

  <p>He turned to them and said with a faint smile, "I've lived next to you for a long time. I've seen things. I can say that your conservative faction is indeed loyal and responsible to your duties. Unfortunately, you are unaware that Herbert doesn't care so much about this place."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to say?" the old man slowly stood up and asked with great concern. That got involved with the disputes among the conservative and the free factions.</p>

  <p>When the free faction wanted to leave that world in the past, they didn't fight against the conservative faction. Instead, they had an intense debate that lasted for many years.</p>

  <p>The most principal opinion of the free faction was that their master had given up on them and their world, making their race expendable.</p>

  <p>As for the conservative faction, they insisted that their master would return to their world sooner or later and that they should stick to their task.</p>

  <p>The old man had insisted on carrying out his task until now.</p>

  <p>"There isn't just one prison," the tomb keeper shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Herbert built sixty to seventy of these at the bottom of the chaos, and he repeated the process but failed each time. This one you've been guarding is just one of his failures. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"A failure? Why is it a failure? No one has ever escaped from here since the very beginning!" The old man demanded in a serious but quivering voice.</p>

  <p>He had spent his whole life guarding this place, only to be told that it was just a failure. That was unacceptable, not to mention that the Warden race had spent countless years in that place.</p>

  <p>Who could accept such a harsh truth?</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper maintained his lazy smile. Looking at the old man's distressed face, he couldn't help but sigh. "The Chaos Ancient Gods have already become significant figures of the entire chaos," he said. "Do you really think Herbert was bored enough to arrange such a prison and capture some insignificant people? Do the exiles have such values?"</p>

  <p>Even powerful people like Emily and Timotheus didn't have the qualification to be taken seriously by the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Chaos Ancient Gods, the exiles were nothing.</p>

  <p>That was why the young man's words rendered the old man speechless.</p>

  <p>He knew he was right.</p>

  <p>If their supreme master was one of the most powerful beings in the chaos, then why did he have to imprison the exiles in that place?</p>

  <p>For the Warden race to question their master's intention was disrespectful, so they never wondered about such matters in the past.</p>

  <p>"Our master... Why did he create this world? Why? Why did he create us?" The old man struggled to ask.</p>

  <p>The free faction had raised such a question countless times in the past.</p>

  <p>He understood their standpoint at that very moment.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on his face, the tomb keeper said, "You don't need to know that anymore. Your master has given up on you, so you don't have to be too hard on yourself anymore. If the exiles want to leave, you can let them go. It's not bad for things to end this way."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" The man with purple hair finally shouted after holding back for a while.</p>

  <p>The old man added, "Guarding this prison is the responsibility of our race. That is the reason why we were created. Even if our master turned his back on us, we won't give up. If you don't want to help us, then we shall take our leave."</p>

  <p>The old man bowed in respect to the tomb keeper then turned around to depart.</p>

  <p>The man with purple hair followed close behind. In his opinion, their leader made an unnecessary move by asking for the young man's help.</p>

  <p>There was no reason for them to ask assistance from a freak like him.</p>

  <p>As they began to walk away from the tomb, the young man said,</p>

  <p>"Although your determination bores me, I appreciate persistent people like you."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stretched himself which made cracking noises. "I've stayed here for too long. This tablet didn't do me any good. I think I'd like to get some good exercise now."</p>

  <p>His statement stopped the old man in his tracks. He turned back around and looked straight at the tomb keeper. His dim eyes lit up with excitement. "Are you going to help us?"</p>

  <p>On the other side, however, Emily, Luo Zheng, and others also stopped their steps.</p>

  <p>A man in a black robe stood before them. Blue butterflies danced around him.</p>

  <p>Although those butterflies were extremely beautiful, they contained deadly power.</p>

  <p>"You can't pass," the man in the black robe said flatly.</p>

  <p>More black-robed men began to appear on the roofs and both sides of the street.</p>

  <p>Some of the Wild Gods and exiles could not help but take several steps back. That was the first time that they had to fight against the Warden race, and they were very frightened.</p>
