<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's silhouette flew through the air, his sword light like wheels of light.</p>

  <p>Although these Sacred elite warriors had their own consciousness and techniques, Luo Luo Zheng was able to easily kill them without much effort.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, he had travelled nearly half the distance on the True Path.</p>

  <p>Freya, Livingston, Xun, and Saul stood at the starting point of the True Path in silence as they watched Luo Luo Zheng fight.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's cultivation speed is not slow. Two years ago, he was only at the first grade of Life and Death Realm," Saul commented. In truth, Luo Luo Zheng had not relied on his own strength to pass the second stage of the True Path two years ago.</p>

  <p>Freya glanced at Saul furtively. In two years, Luo Luo Zheng had crossed a great realm! Yet Saul's only conclusion was that Luo Zheng's cultivation speed was not slow. In her eyes, his cultivation speed was pretty unbelievable. Back then, she had expended a country's resources in order to break through that realm.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded in approval. "It is indeed not slow, but it is still not enough. Isn't the Illusion Battlefield about to open? Before Luo Luo Zheng enters the battlefield, his strength will need to increase even more!"</p>

  <p>As for Livingston, he stood frozen as he watched Luo Luo Zheng. He did not care whether or not Luo Luo Zheng had improved or how much he must improve further.</p>

  <p>He only cared for the weapon refining workshop in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>In just a few moments, each of the Sacred elite warriors had been eliminated by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Strangely, the Dark and Light energies on the True Path did not condense again. Luo Luo Zheng was the only one running on the path.</p>

  <p>"How is the third stage so easy to pass?" A look of doubt passed Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng naturally would not miss the chance to pass through the True Path.</p>

  <p>Since there was no resistance, his speed increased a bit.</p>

  <p>However, the situation did not last for long. After a while, the Dark and Light energies slowly began to circulate and gather once again. This time, they gathered at a single point. Ever so slowly, they morphed into a person.</p>

  <p>"Who is it? Who's there?" A grave look marred Luo Zheng's features as he took in the human figure. There was no way that such a flaw would appear on the True Path. This person must indeed be strong.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the human form became more and more distinct. It was a young man dressed in cotton clothes. His hands and feet were bare, and he did not hold any weapons in his hands.</p>

  <p>"A warrior at the early stage of Soul Sea Realm?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was puzzled as he sized up his opponent. The cultivation level of this young man was almost the same as his. Previously, the elite warriors from the Sacred race he had encountered had all been at the Soul Sea Realm. Some of them had even been at the later stage of the Soul Sea Realm. But now, a warrior at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm had materialized before him. This left Luo Luo Zheng rather confused.</p>

  <p>As the young man's figure was outlined and became more visible, his face revealed a strange smile. The next instant, he began to run ahead with all his might.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He ran on the side of the True Path, sprinting forward as he closed in on Luo Luo Zheng. He was, in fact, quicker than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"So fast?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly shocked, but the power of his grip on the Thunder Wind Divine Sword only increased. When the young man got near enough, Luo Luo Zheng would waste no time in killing him.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Fifty feet...</p>

  <p>Thirty feet...</p>

  <p>"Nether God Shadows!"</p>

  <p>When the young man was less than thirty feet away, Luo Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword vibrated lightly and seven Nether God Shadows leaped out. They shot toward the young man swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>A soft laugh escaped the young man's lips. He suddenly jumped up and turned his body.</p>

  <p>For some unknown reason, Luo Luo Zheng felt his vision blur as the man easily avoided the seven Nether God Shadows.</p>

  <p>"What is this movement technique? It is so odd!" A light passed through Luo Zheng's eyes as the Thunder Wind Divine Sword slashed down at the young man's head.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the young man uttered, "Wait! No hurry."</p>

  <p>As he said this, he stretched his fingers and lightly flicked Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz?</p>

  <p>With such a light flick, his strength should not have been great. However, the sword in Luo Zheng's hand began to vibrate heavily, almost making him unable to maintain his grip.</p>

  <p>As the power of the dragon scales surged through him, Luo Luo Zheng forcefully suppressed the vibrations of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. He took a few steps back and pointed the tip of the sword downward. A vigilant expression came over Luo Zheng's features.</p>

  <p>When the young man saw Luo Zheng's reaction and his suppression of the vibrations of the sword, he was a bit surprised. A smile appeared on his face as he said to Luo Luo Zheng, "Are you the new owner of the Immortal Mansion?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not answer his question, but asked instead, "Who are you?" The man before him had also materialized from the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>However, he seemed to be more special. Not only was his strength extraordinary, but he seemed eager to talk to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Me? Ha!" The young man laughed.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, Saul cut in, "Gus, he is Luo Luo Zheng, your junior fellow disciple."</p>

  <p>Hearing Saul's words, Luo Luo Zheng was utterly shocked. 'So Master has taken in more than just one disciple. This man in front of me is also his disciple.</p>

  <p>He is my senior fellow disciple?'</p>

  <p>The smile that the man named Gus sported only grew wider. He looked at Luo Luo Zheng more closely. "Back then I left this soul fragment here. Now it seems I had made the right move. I didn't expect Master to end up taking in another disciple!"</p>

  <p>As Gus spoke, he seemed to realize something. "Wait!" he said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If Master was willing to accept you as a disciple, does that mean you have cultivated the Primal Chaos Technique?" He looked Luo Luo Zheng up and down with disbelief in his eyes.</p>

  <p>For countless years, the master of the Immortal Mansion had only accepted two disciples. He had divided the cultivation methods of his lifetime into two sections and passed on to each of the two disciples a section. Gus was Luo Zheng's second senior fellow disciple.</p>

  <p>Gus remembered that his master had once said that he would not take in a disciple again, unless the person's physique was suitable to practice the Primal Chaos Technique. His master always kept his word. Since Luo Luo Zheng had become Gus' master's third disciple, he must have mastered the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at Gus, deep in thought. His expression was indifferent, but in his heart, he weighed the strength of the man before him.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, it would be difficult for him to find a suitable opponent at the Soul Sea Realm. However, this man made him feel a faint sense of danger.</p>

  <p>"Answer me, Luo Luo Zheng! Have you truly cultivated the Primal Chaos Technique?" A smirk still adorned Gus' lips as his gaze almost pierced through Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I have no need to tell you that," Luo Luo Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Gus crossed his arms over his chest, seemingly amused. He chuckled as he ambled toward Luo Luo Zheng. "Interesting. You seem to be very arrogant. My body might only have been formed through the Dark and Light energies, and I might only be at the Soul Sea Realm, but I think you will find yourself unable to pass through me. If you show me some respect and just answer my question, I will let you pass unharmed."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he got closer and closer, now only a few feet away from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a good idea." Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "But I don't want to do that."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng's sword light flashed, a chilling blue light leaking from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, straight toward Gus' head.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>Gus' feet were as if nailed to the ground, and his body did not move at all. Instead, he leaned to the side. He tapped at the Thunder Wind Divine Sword slightly, and it began to violently tremble once again and left Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have expected this move. He did not pursue his sword.</p>

  <p>Instead, with the power of over ten thousand dragon scales that had poured themselves into his two fists, he threw two punches at Gus with all his might.</p>

  <p>"Hey now, Luo Luo Zheng. Get this right. I am from the Sacred race. The difference in power between you and me is? "</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Gus did not take Luo Zheng's attack seriously. He chuckled, about to be at the receiving end of both of Luo Zheng's fists. He merely swung one hand out.</p>

  <p>It was not that Gus looked down upon Luo Luo Zheng. The Sacred race had originally been a perfect race. It was the origin of all primates. Humans had been born out of the Sacred race and had inherited some of their strength.</p>

  <p>However, Gus did not expect the formidable power stored in Luo Zheng's fists.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Soul Sea Realm. Before Gus knew it, he was sent flying backward by Luo Zheng's fists. He didn't drop to the ground until he had flown thousands of feet in the air.</p>
