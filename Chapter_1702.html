<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing Shania create a Luo Zheng in such a short period of time, the Supreme Lords found themselves holding their breath.</p>

  <p>Many world lords were stunned in disbelief. The scene in the painting before them had their eyes go wide.</p>

  <p>Before this moment, they had thought it possible for Shania to easily create a special plant or beast.</p>

  <p>Having cultivated the Life Law for many years, it wasn't difficult for Shania to do so.</p>

  <p>Once one reached the sixth level of the Life Law, one should be able to create creatures.</p>

  <p>Though it would take quite a while, one could create any creature that he needed.</p>

  <p>After reaching the seventh level, the creation process sped up. At Ying's level, one could create a creature to fight against the enemy in mere seconds.</p>

  <p>But before creating a creature, one had to have a thorough understanding of these creatures and they weren't exactly complete.</p>

  <p>But Shania managed to duplicate Luo Zheng so quickly.</p>

  <p>One Heavenly Destiny called the Heavenly Destiny of Creation in the heavens was the limit of the Life Law— it was the tenth-level profound mystery.</p>

  <p>Warriors with this Heavenly Destiny could create such life.</p>

  <p>And Ying, Queen of Life, was standing in as Shania.</p>

  <p>In strength, she might've matched a Supreme Lord, but she did not bear a Heavenly Destiny. It should have been impossible for her to know the profound mysteries of creating creatures.</p>

  <p>And yet, she created Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords just couldn't believe what happened.</p>

  <p>She wasn't a Supreme Lord… How did she do it?</p>

  <p>What followed was even more unimaginable. The green balls fell from the Staff of Life and turned into a real 'Luo Zheng, ' one after another until they all stood in a row.</p>

  <p>These identical copies of Luo Zheng wore indifferent expressions.</p>

  <p>"Even the Supreme Lord who bears the Heavenly Destiny of Creation isn't able to activate his skill at will."</p>

  <p>"Creation of creatures has a limit. This is an all too powerful ability. One should only be able to create one creature at a time."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that Ying didn't only break the restriction of the ninth level of the law…she also broke the very universe's restriction, right?"</p>

  <p>"This… this is power that crosses the heavens!"</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords revealed a look of shock upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>For thousands of lower-level warriors, they could clearly feel the restriction of the heavens.</p>

  <p>It didn't need to be said that it was already extremely difficult for a warrior to even reach the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>Not to mention, becoming a world lord or Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Even if they dedicated their lives to this goal, there was no guarantee that the effort would bear fruit.</p>

  <p>This restriction meant nothing to ordinary warriors— they knew they couldn't reach it in their own lifetimes.</p>

  <p>But it was different for these Supreme Lords. They were restricted by the heavens, unable to reach the next realm. They could only watch themselves grow old and fall into the Five Aging Processes. In the end, they would become a story in the universe to be submerged by the tides of history.</p>

  <p>What Shania had displayed was what they dreamed of for the longest time.</p>

  <p>It wasn't even an especially strong skill— even if she managed to create hundreds or thousands of clones, the Supreme Lords could kill them in seconds.</p>

  <p>But the profoundness of the skill was highly valuable, so much that none of the Supreme Lords could just ignore it.</p>

  <p>'How did this girl… How did Shania do it?'</p>

  <p>'I will personally visit the Demon Night race!'</p>

  <p>'After the Illusion Battlefield is over, I'll give them a visit and figure it out myself!'</p>

  <p>All the Supreme lords held such ideas in their minds. Some even wanted to set out immediately. But the battles in the Illusion Battlefield hadn't yet ended— they were afraid of missing any important details in their absence.</p>

  <p>In the palace surrounded by clouds, confusion struck the mysterious girl's face as she stared at the 'Zhengs' that Shania created.</p>

  <p>"It is the ability to create creatures…the tenth level of the Life Law," she muttered to herself.</p>

  <p>With a wave of her hand, a golden light appeared around it.</p>

  <p>"The Crown of Destiny used for creating creatures has already been taken back to the heavens. This woman is truly powerful," she said with a frown. After looking Shania up and down, the mysterious girl then stared at the Staff of Life in the latter's hand.</p>

  <p>"This supreme divine weapon only has the Law of Causality of the life flood. It cannot help her create creatures.</p>

  <p>How strange… this sort of thing hadn't happened for several grand eras."</p>

  <p>While the girl was still in a state of confusion, she fixed her gaze on a trace of green. After seeing the Life Law, she was still lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Somehow, she felt it ridiculous that an unsolvable puzzle existed in the universe.</p>

  <p>Just then, Shania unexpectedly raised her head while the mysterious girl examined her. With some contempt, Shania smiled at the thick clouds.</p>

  <p>No one could tell if she did it deliberately or unwittingly.</p>

  <p>"What? How dare she laugh at me?" The mysterious girl was angry, having felt that she was fooled.</p>

  <p>On the board, Shania turned to Luo Zheng and said, "I do envy the Godly Geniuses like you. You were born with talent and have the power to cross the heavens. We're just poor old people…"</p>

  <p>But Ying was not old by any means. Ying, Yao, and Xun were the new queens, extremely young for their positions compared to the Supreme Lords. Shania had the body of a mere twenty-year-old girl after reincarnation. In this manner, she was so much younger than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your strange sword holds great power," she smiled. "But are you sure you can defeat your own strength? Do you think you can defeat… ten of yourself?"</p>

  <p>With that, the ten clones started moving.</p>

  <p>Each hair and muscle they had were exactly like Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Technically, Shania's technique was not that of creating creatures.</p>

  <p>Instead, she cloned Luo Zheng using the ability.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a blink, the ten clones disappeared instantly from before Shania and were flying toward Luo Zheng from different directions.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng had entered the state of emotion closing. Otherwise, he would have felt too uncomfortable seeing ten of his clones completely naked.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng hadn't completely become a Godly Genius, therefore, he couldn't completely close off his emotions. The uncomfortable feeling was inevitable.</p>

  <p>But he didn't let that feeling affect his attacks.</p>

  <p>It was clear to him that this woman was displaying something for the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>He couldn't tell exactly what she wanted to achieve.</p>

  <p>But winning was the lone thing on Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Wielding the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, he made sharp sword intent shot out abruptly.</p>

  <p>The attack was aimed at the 'Luo Zheng' rushing toward him.</p>

  <p>But the sword light emitted by the Gods-intimidating Strike didn't manage to touch the clone as a white fog spread out of his body.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies?" Luo Zheng exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>The body of that particular 'Luo Zheng' twisted in the air incredibly as he attempted to dodge the strike.</p>

  <p>But the Gods-intimidating Strike was also undeniably fast. Though the Eight Smoky Melodies was indeed powerful, the former could easily break the three-inch limitation and cut the 'Luo Zheng'.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Blood started flowing. But still, the strike only cut the clone's skin.</p>

  <p>The 'Luo Zheng' made a strange turn in the air and rushed toward his opponent.</p>

  <p>Not daring to directly block the strong charge, Luo Zheng backed up quickly.</p>

  <p>But just as he did, three 'Zhengs' came charging at him from different directions.</p>

  <p>"Nether God Shadow!"</p>

  <p>Ten shadows akin to Luo Zheng shot out from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, flying toward the other copies of 'Luo Zheng.'</p>

  <p>This Nether God Shadow proved to be very useful— the moves they launched were of the same fist fighting technique which Luo Zheng had cultivated.</p>

  <p>But the Nether God Shadow was merely a sword technique— it couldn't withstand the "Zhengs".</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>In three seconds, the Nether God Shadows released by Luo Zheng himself was killed by his duplicates.</p>

  <p>Finally, the first 'Luo Zheng' stood before him and immediately went for a punch.</p>

  <p>"This Luo Zheng is famous for his strength. What will he do now in the face of his own?"</p>

  <p>"Haha! Ten Zhengs. They can probably punch him to death."</p>

  <p>"This ability to create creatures…it's truly magical. It seems that she can wholly clone a creature."</p>

  <p>At this point, most of them didn't care about how Shania had broken the rules.</p>

  <p>All they were interested in was seeing who would win the battle.</p>

  <p>Ten 'Zhengs' against the lone Luo Zheng— the crowd was certain of the real Zheng's defeat.</p>
