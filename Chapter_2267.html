<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly extremely difficult to remove the Ice Soul Flame from a body it had invaded.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary low-rank True God was frozen as such, Luo Luo Zheng would have already won.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Moore cultivated the Snow Divine Dao or because he had some special treasure protecting his body. He merely curled up into a ball and lay motionless on the ground, but by then the outcome of the Arena of Legends hadn't yet been decided.</p>

  <p>Still, Moore had lost the ability to resist. Luo Luo Zheng walked over and leaped high into the air. The tips of his toes had gathered a powerful force that he charged right at Moore.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng crushed Moore's body into a million pieces.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the world of ice and snow began to dissipate. When Luo Luo Zheng returned to his room, his injuries disappeared.</p>

  <p>"The eleventh consecutive win."</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips. He didn't expect it to be so difficult.</p>

  <p>In truth, he had already predicted such difficulty, and so had Joy. It was widely known that Moore ranked twentieth among the low-rank True Gods. He was much stronger than the low-rank True Gods that Luo Luo Zheng had fought at that stage? Luo Luo Zheng had practiced the Gods Killing Sword Array in preparation because of this.</p>

  <p>But never did Luo Luo Zheng expect that someone would lower his rank just to challenge him.</p>

  <p>If he really fought all the way up in the Hall of True Gods, he would surely have to use the Gods Killing Sword Array to deal with the powerhouses among the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>But if he used the Gods Killing Sword Array now, his opponents were likely to guess that he was from the Han Clan and the Purple Soul Hall? exposing himself too early was unfavorable to the Han Clan. By then, within the Hall of True Gods, many clans would do all they could to deal with the True Gods of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"I must be careful next time. I can't accept any more challenges," Luo Luo Zheng said to himself rather dejectedly. The warriors who lowered their ranks to challenge him were interrupting his plans.</p>

  <p>Even more dejected was Moore.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Arena of Legends, the fat on his round face kept shaking. "The Ice Soul Flame? How could it be the Ice Soul Flame?"</p>

  <p>It was no big deal to lose some points, nor did it matter to lose hundreds of divine might coins. But Moore was not satisfied losing to a proving godly warrior who fought with those beyond his level.</p>

  <p>Many disciples from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had gone to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land? Moore was no exception, and he had also gone to its interior world arranged by Holy Jay. Since he mainly practiced the Snow Divine Dao, it was natural for him to yearn for the Ice Soul Flame. If the Snow Divine Spear could be combined with the magical ice flame, his power would be enhanced remarkably.</p>

  <p>But in the end, he failed. It was said to be impossible for warriors to comprehend the Ice Soul Flame in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Was this young man Holy Jay's disciple?</p>

  <p>After leaving his room, Moore withdrew from the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Moore. I heard that you were defeated by the anonymous man too," a long haired man in white teased.</p>

  <p>Many people witnessed how the anonymous man accepted Moore's challenge. When he was defeated, the room's ranking changed once again. Those who paid attention to their fight immediately knew of the outcome.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I failed. So what?" Moore stared back at the man coldly.</p>

  <p>But the stranger was thick-skinned enough to ignore Moore's glare.</p>

  <p>"What about it? Have you found anything new? Since you were defeated by that guy, he will definitely win at least twenty times consecutively!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, Moore pondered before saying seriously, "He can't break my Snow Divine Spear, and I've successfully planted four frost marks on him."</p>

  <p>"Four marks! You must be joking!" The man's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Why did you lose, then? He should have been dead already."</p>

  <p>People familiar with Moore knew just how powerful his Snow Divine Spear was.</p>

  <p>With three frost marks, his opponents would most likely fail.</p>

  <p>With a fourth frost mark, many of the mid-rank True Gods could die from it.</p>

  <p>It was amazing in itself that the anonymous man survived and defeated Moore.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Moore? Don't lie to us. Maybe the guy seized the chance to defeat you from the very beginning. You must be feeling so ashamed that you fabricate a story, right?" someone chimed in. He was a monk with a large, bald head and big ears, as fat as Moore.</p>

  <p>In the area where Moore was, the best warriors of the Floating Island of the Moon Clan were gathered? there were nearly no weak warriors whatsoever.</p>

  <p>All of them had witnessed how strong Moore was. The power of his Snow Divine Spear had been multiplied, making the fourth strike incredibly strong. It was difficult to believe that the anonymous man could block his fourth strike.</p>

  <p>The accusation made Moore glare at the monk. "Believe it or not, it's true! I thought I would definitely win, but he was still breathing!"</p>

  <p>"He managed to defeat you with a single breath left?" the monk asked further.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what kind of method he used?" Moore merely shrugged.</p>

  <p>"It seemed like the Ice Soul Flame. That guy has reached the consummation level of this skill!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the long-haired man and the monk were stunned silent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a hoarse voice resounded from nearby. "He entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land," said a masked woman. "He must have come from one of the Floating Islands."</p>

  <p>The descendants of the Floating Islands had the luxury of entering the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land easily. Ordinary divine citizens in the divine land did not have such qualifications? those who were sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were considered extremely lucky.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. He's also likely to be a secondary creature," the monk retorted. "He grew up in a universe."</p>

  <p>"Are you certain he's a secondary creature?" the masked woman asked.</p>

  <p>But the monk shook his head. "I just think it's possible."</p>

  <p>Even Moore speculated about Luo Zheng's origins. After a moment of thought, he asked, "Is it possible that he's from the Gu Clan?"</p>

  <p>Not many Gu Clan warriors were on their Floating Island, but almost all of them were powerhouses.</p>

  <p>Though Holy Jay did not have his own Floating Island, he had a good relationship with Holy Bromley. If Holy Jay had his own disciples, it was highly likely that he sent his disciples to the Floating Island of the Gu Clan.</p>

  <p>"It's quite possible!"</p>

  <p>"There must be at least a 70% possibility that the anonymous man is from the Gu Clan."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we can draw any such conclusion until we know more about him, though."</p>

  <p>Many of them were rather convinced of Moore's conjecture.</p>

  <p>But the Moon Clan didn't care much about the ranking of their Floating Island. No matter how well the Gu Clan performed, they couldn't change the status of the Moon Clan in the top three. They were only interested in the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>But they were certain that both the Mu Clan and the Tang Clan would be very interested in the news as their rankings were one place higher and lower than the Gu Clan's respectively.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng had accepted Moore's challenge, many people were given hope. So the low-rank True Gods gathered at the gate of Luo Zheng's room filled with great passion. To challenge Luo Luo Zheng, even the battle for the 100 rankings higher and lower than his had grown intense.</p>

  <p>In order to lower their rankings to qualify for challenging Luo Luo Zheng, some masters even gave up and admitted defeat to each other.</p>

  <p>But much to their disappointment, Luo Luo Zheng no longer accepted their challenges and chose his own opponents randomly.</p>

  <p>In this way, his opponents had once again become the warriors at his level, making it much easier for him to win? he won over and over again.</p>

  <p>On that day, he had four consecutive wins. In total, he had 14 consecutive wins, earning him 112, 000 points. The extra points from winning a single round came up to almost 17, 000.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the low-rank True Gods in the same rank as Luo Luo Zheng usually had over a thousand points? to them, Luo Zheng's points made an astronomical figure.</p>

  <p>But 112, 000 points was by no means his final goal. According to Joy, he needed at least 1.2 million points to protect the Purple Soul Hall and change the ranking of the Han Clan's Floating Island. Luo Luo Zheng still had a long way to go in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>On each of the following days, Luo Luo Zheng only fought two matches.</p>

  <p>Four days later, he had accumulated 22 consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>Because of the string of wins, his ranking quickly rose from 500, 000 to the top 10, 000, top 1, 000, and top 100, until he was finally ranked at the 96th.</p>

  <p>After the last twenty-second round, his ranking rose directly from the 920th to the 96th. In other words, all the opponents he randomly selected were in the top 200.</p>

  <p>These were the best of the low-rank True Gods, as well as the talents among the disciples of powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that they were all eager to accept Luo Zheng's challenge.</p>

  <p>Whoever defeated the anonymous man would receive a great number of points.</p>

  <p>Never did they expect the anonymous man to quietly take his leave from the Hall of True Gods.</p>
