<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As they stood on the stone arch bridge and looked at the place they were supposed to enter, the three top-rank True Gods seemed hesitant.</p>

  <p>They knew that once they set foot in that dangerous place, they would have just a slim chance of survival.</p>

  <p>"It's not too late to turn around from here," Luo Zheng said, smiling lightly.</p>

  <p>He wasn't going to force these people to follow him into the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>He knew that apart from Leland, all the top-rank True Gods were only going to be a burden to him most times.</p>

  <p>"We've made our choices. No regrets," a top-rank True God said firmly.</p>

  <p>Every one of them had their own reasons for leaving here.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The five of them left the stone arch bridge.</p>

  <p>Leland's soul began to vibrate the moment they passed the bridge.</p>

  <p>A strong spiritual sense spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Demi-Holy Being's spiritual sense covered quite a large radius. He could immediately discover any danger the moment it came into existence.</p>

  <p>The others looked over at Leland, feeling his spiritual sense, and understood his actions.</p>

  <p>"This area is huge and empty. Everyone hide your aura and move forward carefully," Leland warned.</p>

  <p>The others nodded, trying their best to hide their auras and glided quietly along the ground. There were rivers of lava all around this area, the dark red lava illuminating their faces.</p>

  <p>There was indeed nothing unusual about this area, nor were there any vicious beasts, just as Leland had said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng used the Reincarnation Soul Weapon to link to the Reincarnation Land. He wanted to observe the movements of the alliance of powerful clans from the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse had said that Gregorio would definitely come back to the Reincarnation Land. It was also highly possible that Samuel would take advantage of this opportunity to return to the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would be in real trouble if Samuel were to bring Nicholas here.</p>

  <p>He didn't stand a chance of winning against the large group of Holy Beings all by himself, which was one of the reasons why Luo Zheng wanted to leave.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he would have spent more time reading the Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>After all, there were still many questions that Luo Zheng hadn't gotten the answers to yet.</p>

  <p>But fortunately for Luo Zheng, he now had the Reincarnation Soul Weapon and even if he wasn't there, he could control the Reincarnation Land and read the Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>These five people flew silently for hundreds of miles in just about an hour.</p>

  <p>Along the way, they encountered more and more lava rivers below them.</p>

  <p>These lava rivers converged into a huge, wider lava sea.</p>

  <p>The shore of the lava sea was a beach that had green sand.</p>

  <p>After a brief discussion, they decided to cross the lava sea.</p>

  <p>They had only just made their decision but Leland turned around and his expression shifted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused at the change in Leland. So he released his spiritual sense to scan the edges of the lava sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't notice anything out of the ordinary along the endless coast.</p>

  <p>After they had left the Reincarnation Land, what they had witnessed made them think that the Abyss Demon Region did not live up to its name.</p>

  <p>They had thought that the Abyss Demon Region was filled with all sorts of vicious beasts. Instead, all they had encountered was emptiness.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Leland was confused. "There is something on the beach that's keeping an eye on us!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods became nervous.</p>

  <p>"I didn't find anything of the sort," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"That feeling just occurred to me. I wonder why though." Leland thought for a while before turning back to the others and saying, "Forget it. We'd better hurry up."</p>

  <p>According to Leland, the most important thing that they had to do right now was to confirm their position and then rise up, stage by stage, to leave.</p>

  <p>However, the Abyss Demon Region spanned several regions and was simply too vast.</p>

  <p>As they were about to set off again, the sand under one of the top-rank True Gods' feet began to move.</p>

  <p>It spiraled crazily, forming a powerful force that sucked down the top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reaction was lightning fast.</p>

  <p>He stretched out a hand and grabbed the shoulder of the top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>This suction force was beyond Luo Zheng's expectation. It was so strong that he couldn't hold on to the top-rank True God's shoulder and ended up tearing a piece of cloth off the True God's shirt before he was pulled into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Down there!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!"</p>

  <p>The other two top-rank True Gods were shocked at this and immediately rose up into the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Leland were still calm.</p>

  <p>At their levels of strength, it wouldn't be dangerous as long as they didn't encounter the fiends in the abyss.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Leland looked at each other, Leland taking the lead in making a move.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands. .</p>

  <p>Having been pushed apart by an invisible force, the green sand rolled apart.</p>

  <p>A ditch that seemed to be a thousand feet deep appeared on the beach.</p>

  <p>Multiple green tentacles wriggled on both sides of the ditch, the top-rank True God caught in one of them.</p>

  <p>It looked like there was a huge octopus hiding beneath the beach.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng flew towards the top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>As he did so, the tentacles swept towards Luo Zheng from both sides of the ditch. ?</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>A golden red whip appeared in Leland's hand.</p>

  <p>He waved the long whip around.</p>

  <p>Many colorful shadows of the whip extended from its end.</p>

  <p>Leland had practiced the Five Elements Godly Way for many years and his mastery of it was great. He had even comprehended three theurgies beyond way on his own.</p>

  <p>The power of his attack couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The great number of whip shadows almost shrouded Luo Zheng and had cut the tentacles off before they could touch him.</p>

  <p>The tentacle that gripped the top-rank True God recoiled rapidly.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng had arrived, the tentacle had managed to pull down the top-rank True God deeper into the sand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and punched the dust heap beside the ditch.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's power was so powerful, it stirred up a large area of sand, the beach rolling down to one side like sandy waves.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had managed to completely overturn the surface of the beach.</p>

  <p>The beast that had been hiding in the beach finally revealed itself.</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand green tentacles scattered across the beach, and at the convergence of these was a huge head.</p>

  <p>The head was triangular in shape and had an ugly-looking, hateful human face.</p>

  <p>And as they watched, it was about to stuff the top-rank True God who was trapped in one of its tentacles into its large mouth.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God smelled the unpleasant odor and was filled with despair.</p>

  <p>But before the beast could swallow the True God, a sword light flashed across the beach.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The thousand tentacles that were connected to the head were all mutilated.</p>

  <p>The giant head let out an ear-splitting shriek of pain and turned to burrow back into the sand.</p>
