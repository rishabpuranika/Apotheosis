<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3827 The Void Sand </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before stepping out of the room with hexagram array, the fox girl signaled Zheng to stand still, and then she gently pressed her white fingers onto Zheng's forehead.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew the power her hand possessed was very formidable. As he was about to retreat, two of the fox girl's fingers had already touched his forehead, and a wisp of black gas instantly penetrated his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a chill seep into his forehead, but the chill immediately disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The fox girl shrugged her slender shoulders and explained, "I just did you a favor, and now you can move more smoothly in the big vortex."</p>

  <p>Zheng suspiciously stared at the fox girl for a few seconds before he stepped into the hexagram array and turned into a flat picture.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng became a painting, a strange feeling stirred in him.</p>

  <p>Previously, after he had transformed into the painting, his angle of sight had been fixed, and he could only view the scenery within a limited range.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, his angle of sight had slightly changed.</p>

  <p>What was happening now?</p>

  <p>Reflexively, Zheng raised his head. He suddenly gazed straight ahead and discovered the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Only then did he realize that he was standing on the Eternal Scroll Painting!</p>

  <p>He was still a painting, but he had turned into a painting that had stood up.</p>

  <p>"This is a skill of the Worm Tapir!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was momentarily stunned before he realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>Both the fox girl and the Worm Tapir could temporarily disappear from the Eternal Scroll Painting, which meant they could jump out of the painting.</p>

  <p>Right now, he had stepped on the No-break Maze. The wall that resembled a line didn't seem to exist to him, and he could cross it with just one leap.</p>

  <p>If someone saw Zheng in the No-break Maze, they wouldn't be able to see his whole body, but only the soles of his feet.</p>

  <p>"No wonder the Worm Tapir is so powerful. Its ability is utterly remarkable." Zheng immediately understood the creature's ability.</p>

  <p>In his current form, it was a piece of cake for him to kill the other creatures of the Other Shore. Those Other Shore creatures were not in the same league as him at all. They would not even know who attacked them if he stepped on them.</p>

  <p>Zheng no longer moved along the maze's pathways. Instead, he moved to cross the walls and headed straight for the end of the No-break Maze.</p>

  <p>When he reached the gate at the end of the No-break Maze, Zheng lowered his body back into the painting and moved out through the gate.</p>

  <p>After passing through the No-break Maze, he reached the third page of the Eternal Scroll Painting and drew within sight of the huge vortex, which appeared in the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage all sighed.</p>

  <p>"It's the Black Disaster. They must have faced it!"</p>

  <p>"This time, the Black Disaster is too powerful. Almost all of them have been slain!"</p>

  <p>"Only a handful of people survived..."</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the Eternal Scroll Painting was known for being extremely dangerous, and this particular sort of danger was known as the Black Disaster.</p>

  <p>Every time the Black Disaster materialized, it could cause havoc and completely destroy the Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>However, the chances of meeting the Black Disaster were very small, and it had never appeared on the first page before.</p>

  <p>When most of the Other Shore creatures perished and only a scraggly few survived, they were convinced that they had met their ends due to the Black Disaster. This time, those who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting would probably be completely annihilated.</p>

  <p>"At least there is one of our members left. Our race still has some hope," an elder of the Life race said.</p>

  <p>"There's no one left of our Swallow Victory race..."</p>

  <p>"It's a great fortune for our Three Eyes race to have two warriors still alive!"</p>

  <p>Just as the Other Shore races were tallying the surviving warriors, someone pointed at the Eternal Scroll Painting and exclaimed, "They're coming out.</p>

  <p>They're about to enter the vortex!"</p>

  <p>After entering the third page, the shapes of the Other Shore creatures were clearly visible. Many Other Shore creatures had materialized at the bottom of the huge vortex.</p>

  <p>Inside the Eternal Scroll Painting</p>

  <p>Egan, Kirk, and the other survivors stood to the side. Instead of entering the vortex immediately, they were quietly checking things out.</p>

  <p>Something floated in the large vortex? a kind of black sand, which was called the Void Sand.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a grain of Void Sand floated towards them and hit the bodies of Egan, Kirk, and the others, after which the sand instantly vanished, leaving a sand sized hole on the surface of their bodies as an agonizing pain filled them.</p>

  <p>Those who had all entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the big vortex on the third page had an instinctual fear of the Void Sand. Even those who had already achieved the Eternal Realm were no exception. Every time they even mentioned the Void Sand, their expressions would be greatly charged with fear.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore creatures might have been able to cultivate to become Eternal Realm warriors, but after being tortured by the Void Sand for some time, they all chose to quit.</p>

  <p>The Void Sand could pierce into the physical body of any creature and dissolve it one bit at a time. And the agonizing pain it caused was not something that could be easily borne by most.</p>

  <p>While they were still quietly watching the big vortex, Zheng stepped through the gate of the No-break Maze.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you okay?" When Egan saw Zheng, a pleasantly surprised look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>When the other creatures of the Other Shore laid eyes on Zheng, they let out a collective sigh of relief. They were glad that Zheng had made it through alive.</p>

  <p>Although these Other Shore creatures all had their own viewpoints, Zheng had saved their lives in the end. At the very least, they could fight together on the same side here.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Zheng replied. "Why haven't you entered the big vortex yet?"</p>

  <p>"We're waiting for you," Egan said with a bashful smile.</p>

  <p>In fact, so many terrible things had transpired on the first and second pages, so these warriors were all a bit scared.</p>

  <p>Although there were neither beasts, nor the Black Disaster on the third page, they were afraid that an accident would happen again. If someone as powerful as Zheng could lead them and face the dangers first, it would fill them with a certain sense of security.</p>

  <p>"In that case, we should go in now!" said Zheng.</p>

  <p>He finally reached the final step, so he became a little excited.</p>

  <p>Before he had taken more than a few steps, a grain of Void Sand came hurtling at him from the distance and hit the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>Ba!</p>

  <p>The moment the grain of sand impacted with Zheng's body, it instantly vanished. A sharp and lancing pain instantly pierced him as if a needle had shot right into his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Although the pain lasted for a short while, it had a burning intensity. It seemed that there was nothing Zheng could do to eliminate or avoid it.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Void Sand?"</p>

  <p>Earlier, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had instructed Zheng that this large vortex was constructed from a massive amount of Void Sand, with each grain being able to devour the material it impacted with.</p>

  <p>If enough Void Sand were to hit someone, their physical body would be utterly dissolved by the sand.</p>

  <p>But it didn't seem to faze Zheng at all since he had the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Zheng gently stroked the area where the Void Sand had hit. With the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, his body remained intact and unscathed. "It doesn't seem to have had any lingering effect."</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits are really able to block the Void Sand..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven also seemed a bit surprised. He then cautioned,</p>

  <p>"That's indeed good news for you, but don't become careless. The Void Sand can dissolve more than just your body."</p>

  <p>"Dissolve my soul." Zheng frowned tightly.</p>

  <p>Although the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body could physically fend off the sand, he didn't have an effective method to protect his soul. Without anything else to rely on, he would only have the protection of the nine Holy Soul Imprints.</p>
