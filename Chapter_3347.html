<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that the several members of the Nine Li race didn't need to cultivate the Flow Strike, so there was no need for them to go out.</p>

  <p>For most of the time, they would put their Souls of Light on the Other Shore and cultivated there.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had first met with Sally, the girl had been upset about how she could get two thousand soul pills.</p>

  <p>That meant the remaining members of the Nine Li race lacked money and therefore, it wasn't easy for them to improve their Souls of Light to reach Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>After the six members of the Nine Li race had settled down, Zheng ordered them to enter the Other Shore the next day.</p>

  <p>The order confused Sally and Hutton a little. They wondered what Zheng wanted to do.</p>

  <p>"You are the members of my race, so you may take all of this as a gift from me," Zheng spoke.</p>

  <p>Then, he took out 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal from the Sumeru Space. When divided, each of the six of them could naturally get five finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>A chill ran down Sally's, Hutton's, and Umar's spines as soon as they sensed the pure aura that emanated from the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>They knew that Zheng's physical body was so powerful that he could do anything he liked on the Other Shore, and that it wasn't difficult for him to obtain some Other Shore Tokens and soul crystal. Even then, it still shocked them to see him casually take out 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal and just give them to them.</p>

  <p>Last time, they had entered the Grand Sky Temple and offered those soul pills which had been raised by the elders of their race after they had sold an Other Shore Token to the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>Now, the 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal were worth 30 million soul pills, and it was absolutely impossible to buy so many chunks of soul crystal with even 30 million soul pills!</p>

  <p>"Young master... The gift is too precious," Hutton muttered, his eyes glued to the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>He had indeed thought of refusing, but any Soul of Light that cultivated on the Other Shore couldn't resist such a temptation. After all, the soul crystal was almost the same as cultivation of the Soul of Light. Their soul cultivation could improve according to the amount of the soul crystal they absorbed.</p>

  <p>"When I first entered the Source World, I also wanted to search for the members of the Nine Li race, but the Source World is too large. At that time, my cultivation base was low and I could not find anyone. After that, I have stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace to cultivate until now. I have made some achievements. I am glad to meet you all and give you the gift. If the rest members of the Nine Li race have any difficulty, please tell me. I will do my best to help all of you," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew that if he wanted to rebuild the Nine Li race, he would have to put a great amount of effort for it. Compared to that task, what he gave to the members of the Nine Li race was really nothing.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had given them the soul crystal, he went back to his own house.</p>

  <p>A member from the Phoenix Palace informed him that Flamine invited him to meet her.</p>

  <p>As for Elvinia, it had been more than ten days since she was taken away.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know her situation, but since Flamine invited him now, he quickly rushed to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>The last time he left the Phoenix Palace, Flamine had already given him the token to enter it. This time, he naturally didn't need to break the fog with his Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he arrived. After he entered the Phoenix Palace, a maid ushered him into a palace on the side.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the door of the palace, however, he heard Elvinia's loud screams from inside. "Get out of the way! I want to get out!"</p>

  <p>In the palace, golden chains made of flames twined around Elvinia's hands and feet.</p>

  <p>No matter how much she struggled, the chains firmly locked her and she couldn't move at all.</p>

  <p>Several servants in the palace kept encouraging her, but they all looked distressed for her.</p>

  <p>"How... How could this be?" Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine has used many ways to treat Princess Elvinia, but they didn't work. She clamors to leave every day, and she just made Lady Flamine so angry that she left," the maid answered.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't work well..."</p>

  <p>It was well known that an injury on the soul was truly difficult to cure.</p>

  <p>After last time when Milo had used the taboo method, he still hadn't returned to the Flow Sword Sect yet.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Elvinia returned, Flamine was confident about curing Elvinia. Zheng also thought that it might not be that hard to cure her, but he didn't expect that there was no progress at all these days.</p>

  <p>Elvinia still struggled, but she couldn't do whatever she wanted because she was not on the Other Shore now.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked towards her. Elvinia, who had been burning with anger, was stunned to see him. Her hysterical shouts quickly calmed down at the sight of him. She looked at him and pleaded, "Zheng, you are here! Take me out of here! My mother wants to kill me!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine is your mother. Why would she want to kill you?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"She wants to kill me!" Elvinia repeated firmly. At that moment, Zheng didn't notice that Flamine was already behind him until she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to get rid of the messy memories in her mind, but a considerable amount of memories have been integrated into her Memory Flame and become a part of her."</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard for Flamine to remove memories, but the purified being's memories had been integrated with Elvinia. Deleting those memories would be equal to destroying Elvinia. That was why Elvinia believed that Flamine wanted to kill her, but in reality, Flamine only wanted to remove the memories of Teague.</p>

  <p>In Elvinia's point of view though, she still believed that her mother intended to kill her.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, why did you invite me to come over?" asked Zheng. Although Zheng had controlled the Reincarnation Land in divine land, his method of dealing with or curing souls was far off from Flamine's advanced techniques.</p>

  <p>He didn't think he could help much. Yet, she still summoned him, so there had to be a reason.</p>

  <p>"I have to remove the memories when she is awake, but those messy memories which don't belong to her are hidden in the deepest part of her Memory Flame. I can't dig them out," said Flamine.</p>

  <p>When Elvinia became a purified being, she didn't recognize or talk to anyone except for Zheng. After careful consideration, Flamine decided to ask Zheng for help.</p>

  <p>She had planned to invite him to help her since the very beginning, but she realized that he had just gotten out of the Other Shore. Thus, she waited for a few more days.</p>

  <p>"I will try my best to do what I can," Zheng promised.</p>

  <p>He knew he also had to take some responsibility for Elvinia's bad situation, though back then, Elvinia insisted on entering the Grand Sky Temple and he couldn't stop her.</p>

  <p>Then again, the only reason Zheng was able to leave the Dark Region was because he had Elvinia to rely on.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had agreed to help Flamine, she left the palace for a moment and came back with three old men.</p>

  <p>The three old men quietly took their respective positions, and then a big array on the ground began to flash.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the light horrified Elvinia, who had just calmed down.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, they want to kill me again! Kill them for me!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng knew that such a kind of fear was out of instinct, but the pleading look on her face made him sympathize with her.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat up straight in front of Elvinia and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Elvinia!" she exclaimed. Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You are not Elvinia. If you are, you won't be afraid," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm not Elvinia?" She was a little confused by Zheng's words. "Then who am I?"</p>

  <p>"You are Teague, a creature from the Dark Region. I have destroyed your race! I am the one who killed all of the pig-faced monsters," Zheng gravely said.</p>

  <p>Teague's memories only occupied a small part of Elvinia's memories. If Zheng hadn't mentioned such things, Elvinia wouldn't have remembered them. He had verified it in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>So when Zheng mentioned that one memory, some of Teague's memories flashed through Elvinia's mind. It wouldn't be so easy for Teague to forget the fact that his race had been destroyed, nor could he simply set aside his resentment for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Elvinia's pretty face suddenly turned ferocious, as if she wanted to swallow him. "How dare you destroy my race! I'll kill you!" she roared.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng quickly said to Flamine, "Lady Flamine, it's the time!"</p>

  <p>Delight filled Flamine's eyes. How could she be willing to miss this opportunity?</p>

  <p>She winked at the three old men, and the array in the palace was fully activated. Then, Flamine's hand transformed into a claw and covered Elvinia's head.</p>
