  <p>
</p>

  <p>Was this woman mad?</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still on the spot hearing her words which made him flabbergasted. "Cleanse the entire divine land? What do you want to get rid of?"</p>

  <p>"All arrogant humans," the woman answered seriously.</p>

  <p>"You mean you want to kill everyone?" Zheng asked as he couldn't comprehend why was the woman thinking about such a plan.</p>

  <p>The woman raised her head and stared at Zheng's eyes. Her eyes flashed with a gleam as she said earnestly, "That's for sure! What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Confirming that the woman was indeed serious, he tried his best to calm down.</p>

  <p>He collected his thoughts about what the woman had said. She just mentioned that she wanted to find a way to own a real body, which meant that she herself had been relying on the Faith Energy. It also signified that she was a monster born in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>From what he had experienced in the Sea of Meditation, Zheng believed that it was very likely that this woman was born in the Sea of Meditation. Was it possible that she was also an unknown fearful thing?</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to kill all the humans?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>The expression on the woman's face changed as a vicious light flashed once more. "Because the divine land belongs to our Nine Li race! How could we let these insects without our race's blood control the divine land? Our Nine Li race should have been the real Holy Beings in the divine land! But such positions have been occupied by those humble nobodies. They all should die!"</p>

  <p>"But you are not a person of the Nine Li race, either. You also don't have Chiyou's blood," stated Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was only him and Lorena who really had the Nine Li race's blood in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The woman in front of him wasn't even a real living creature, so naturally she was not considered as someone with the Nine Li race's blood.</p>

  <p>The woman was unaffected by Zheng's rebuttal and just smiled faintly. Her gaze continued to linger at Zheng revealing a hint of passion, as if she was looking at her true love. "So it's really lucky for me to find you in the Sea of Meditation. Having you, I can own the Nine Li race's blood."</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed that the woman did not show any enmity towards him, but her gaze still made him feel creepy. Why would such a strange woman be born in the Sea of Meditation?</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng suddenly felt a tremor under his feet.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>An explosive sound came from afar.</p>

  <p>The sound was heard from far away, but it still spread out such heavy power. One could imagine that there must be some powerful masters in the upper part recklessly destroying the ice palace.</p>

  <p>"What's that sound?" Zheng was disturbed as he raised his head and looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled and answered, "Those Holy Beings have entered the palace."</p>

  <p>"How did they find this ice palace?" His eyebrows slightly raised as a look of vigilance appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The woman might not have some good intentions but she wouldn't kill Zheng for the time being. However, the moment he would meet Nicholas, he could be in trouble!</p>

  <p>She then indifferently glanced at Zheng and confessed, "I let them in!"</p>

  <p>"Let them in? Why?" Zheng asked and wondered what the woman could be planning.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't respond and simply said, "You wait here..."</p>

  <p>For her, Zheng had no decisive effect on what would happen next in her eyes.</p>

  <p>After all, the most important for her was the blood in his body.</p>

  <p>Saying the words for Zheng to stay, she slightly tapped the tip of her toes as her body had instantly passed through the ice and shot upward.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the upper part of the ice palace, the Holy Beings had successfully entered the ice palace and decided to explore down after a period of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The woman had provided such useful information. And as she said that the supreme treasure of belief that could control the Abyss Demon Region was located at the ice palace, they didn't mind digging into the entire palace!</p>

  <p>They had been digging for quite some time, and only then did they discover how huge the ice palace was.</p>

  <p>After several Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods took turns to take action, Clark got impatient and wanted to have a try.</p>

  <p>He put his feet on the crystal clear ice surface and suddenly punched downwards!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Cold air was originally surrounding the area, but because of the hit, a scorching heat spread in all directions immediately dispelling it.</p>

  <p>The ice walls surrounding Clark had dissolved quickly.</p>

  <p>Following after, a circular fire column descended!</p>

  <p>The ground and ceiling of the ice palace could not withstand such a blow. In an instant, massive white mist had arose!</p>

  <p>It all happened in the blink of an eye, and a passage of about fifty to sixty thousand feet long was right away dug out by Clark!</p>

  <p>The fire column continued to crack down and halted to a stop until it reached sixty thousand feet.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because Clark had restrained himself a bit while giving that blow or he was exhausted. As long as his internal momentum was abundant, the fire column could extend indefinitely in theory.</p>

  <p>He turned his gaze from the fire column. As he looked into the big hole, the expression on his face suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>"That woman has blocked my fire below..."</p>

  <p>During the previous encounter, he had lost his arm just after one round.</p>

  <p>Now seeing this woman, he was naturally full of fear.</p>

  <p>"Let's go downwards!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Nicholas jumped off the big hole dug out by Clark.</p>

  <p>Despite knowing that the woman was quite powerful, Nicholas wouldn't flinch and back out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Seeing his bold move, the others had followed suit and jumped off.</p>

  <p>All along, the woman was just leisurely seated at the bottom. As she saw the Holy Beings flying down in the air, her lips curved up slightly. She stretched out her finger and knocked on an ice column beside her.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The black mist over the Abyss Demon Region rapidly moved downwards and drilled into the ice palace.</p>

  <p>The first one who found the abnormal situation was Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>He was the last one to enter the ice palace. Upon entering, he sensed Zheng's location by the help of the sword that Zheng had inserted in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>It didn't took a long time before he finally determined Zheng's sole position, and he suddenly got stunned. "The ice palace is so big."</p>

  <p>He felt a bit relieved confirming Zheng's presence. As long as he held the sword, he could always sense his location.</p>

  <p>However, before he could go down two or three layers, a thick black mist had suddenly surged in from outside of the ice palace!</p>

  <p>The black mist not only spread in the space of the palace, but also in the ice blocks. The crystal clear building suddenly corrupted and changed to black as charcoal.</p>

  <p>"What kind of mist is this?"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was soon lost in the black mist.</p>

  <p>As he sank into the black mist, a strong sense of fear rose from the bottom of his heart!</p>

  <p>"The force of primitive fear?"</p>

  <p>He halted going down as the surrounding area was gradually enveloped by darkness. The situation made him confused and alert at the same time. All of a sudden, he felt a gust of cold wind blowing from behind, as if a ghost was blowing on his back.</p>

  <p>Without any second thought, he flew forward and at once, a small gold piece was taken out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>The small gold piece was the 'Scorching Gold' that was used in the dark water.</p>

  <p>The Scorching Gold released a ray of dazzling golden light. It eventually helped him scare the unknown things hiding in the darkness away.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen breathed a sigh of relief as his sense of fear disappeared at that moment.</p>

  <p>It seemed that after the dark water had been sucked into the sky, it had now spread down. This meant that the ice palace had also turned into another dark water area. It was fortunate that he had quite a few pieces of Scorching Gold on his hands. Otherwise, it would be troublesome.</p>
