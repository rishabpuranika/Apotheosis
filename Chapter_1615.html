<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were many powerhouses hiding inside the main city.</p>

  <p>After seeing this scene, they went deeper into hiding.</p>

  <p>The method Mu Ning had used to kill the ace talent had alarmed the other ace talents in the city.</p>

  <p>They had secretly investigated her background and found out that she came from the Purple Power World and possessed an extremely rare first-rank Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>That long-haired youth had been ranked 74th in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>After being killed by Mu Ning, half of the massive amount of Illusion Points within his body had been taken by her. Therefore, her ranking had skyrocketed.</p>

  <p>From a bit below the 100th, she rose all the way up to the 64th rank.</p>

  <p>The top 100 martial artists always attracted wide attention throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>The news of Margaret's new rank soon spread to the Purple Power World, causing a loud round of cheers and applause to erupt from the Apeiron Tower.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning has entered the top 100!"</p>

  <p>"The top 100 martial artists are the ace talents from the various clans.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning has really lived up to everyone's expectations!"</p>

  <p>"She boasts a first-rank Purple Power Body, and she can almost be called the leader of the Purple Power World. It is not surprising that she has gotten into the top 100."</p>

  <p>99% of the martial artists who were qualified to join the Purple Power World possessed Purple Power Bodies, but the disparity between the power of the Purple Power Bodies was extremely great.</p>

  <p>A few years ago, the martial artists in the Apeiron Tower had welcomed a junior.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Margaret's seniority was incomparably high in the tower. After all, she had directly taken Elder Apeiron as her master, so she was two or even three ranks higher than most of the disciples in the tower.</p>

  <p>However, she was young in age, so the others treated her as a junior.</p>

  <p>Before she had left for the Illusion Battlefield, however, quite a few people had been extremely worried about her.</p>

  <p>Although her strength and talent were extraordinary, she was innocent and artless, and didn't know much about the world. In the Illusion Battlefield, she would likely suffer many setbacks. After all, when martial artists fought, many times it would not be a contest of strength, but of wisdom and tricks.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning is always talking about that man."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if she will be able to see him in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's going to be a bit difficult. Mu Ning is outstanding, but that man is from the Lower World. I'm afraid he will be eliminated soon.</p>

  <p>How could she possibly meet him?"</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was discussing this, a tall woman appeared. She was also a disciple of Elder Apeiron, and she was Margaret's legitimate senior.</p>

  <p>"Eliminate? Mu Ning is an ace talent. How could her man be eliminated?" the woman asked, disagreeing with all of them.</p>

  <p>During her years at the Apeiron Tower, Mu Ning had only been on good terms with one person— her. So naturally, she knew many secrets about her.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning is from the Lower World, so is her husband. How could he possibly compete with martial artists from the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>"To put it simply, whether that man will be able to enter the top one million in the Illusion Battlefield remains a mystery. I bet he will be eliminated sooner or later!"</p>

  <p>"I think so too."</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the Lower World couldn't cultivate super talents.</p>

  <p>Although the martial artists who were discussing this rarely left the Apeiron Tower or went outside, they knew that there were many famous powerhouses that had flown up from the Lower World, like the famous Supreme Lord Illusion.</p>

  <p>But in the great world that Mu Ning resided in, she was the only one to have a first-rank Purple Power Body. This was already a remarkable feat.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful could the man she missed be?</p>

  <p>However, that girl only smiled faintly. "The man that Mu Ning cares about is called  Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had only mentioned this name to her before, so no one else knew it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"It sounds quite familiar."</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World was located at the edge of the universe, and it was a small broken world. Its location was quite special. In fact, the Purple Power World could be considered to be floating outside the universe, so they were unable to hear the voices transmitted by the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>However, some of the disciples of the Apeiron Tower who traveled across the supreme worlds would bring back news from the outside world.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember! He's the guy who told stories in the universe! It's said that he tricked and killed several Supreme Lords, and his Roaring Token can be used for an unlimited number of times."</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to remember. I've already seen his name. He is currently ranked 125th."</p>

  <p>"It's surprising that Margaret's man is  Luo Zheng Luo. I've heard of him in another world. It's said that several races have ganged up on him and that he is currently hiding in a fairy palace."</p>

  <p>Zheng's name was now near the top of the pyramid, but he had yet to enter the top 100. As such, the people in the Purple Power World hadn't paid much attention to him before. But after finding out that he was Margaret's man, many of them began to look down from the peak of the pyramid and instantly discovered his name.</p>

  <p>Then, the female disciples in the tower began to animatedly discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was someone they were extremely envious of. She was young and highly talented. Moreover, she was the disciple of Elder Apeiron.</p>

  <p>From the moment she had stepped into the tower, she had been blessed.</p>

  <p>All the members of the tower took good care of her. They did everything they could to make her happy and coax her into cultivating and taking bitter pills.</p>

  <p>And just like that, the young Mu Ning had grown up, rising to the top 100 of the Illusion Battlefield without much effort.</p>

  <p>The man that she had been missing was also close to the top 100 now.</p>

  <p>Without doubt, the other girls were tormented by jealousy.</p>

  <p>After all, they also possessed the Purple Power Bodies and had been sent by their clans from faraway places to the Apeiron Tower for cultivation, but they'd never been able to reach Margaret's level. And this final disparity concerning Luo Zheng was too great for them to accept.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng led Janet and the others to climb the peak of the Hall of Causality. They were about to enter the final Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Can this even be called a hall?"</p>

  <p>Coleman shouted as he stared at the row of stone pillars.</p>

  <p>Although it was likely that there had indeed been a large hall on the mountain peak, all that was left in front of them now were circular stone pillars that lined up in a row. The actual hall seemed to have collapsed a long time ago.</p>

  <p>"This is the final test. Do not underestimate it. The difficulty of this hall may be much higher than before," Luo Zheng said vigilantly.</p>

  <p>By now, they had come to a tacit understanding. At Zheng's words, they all followed him at the same time.</p>

  <p>Although the roof of the hall seemed to have disappeared a long time ago, there were still two tall pillars standing by the door. This was the door of the fifth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng walked into the Hall of Causality, a strange feeling bubbled up from the depths of his heart.</p>

  <p>After Janet and the rest walked past two pillars, their expressions also changed slightly.</p>

  <p>Creak…</p>

  <p>The crowd heard an ear-piercing sound that made their teeth ache. It was the sound of the door's shafts badly in need of a repair.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>That ear-piercing sound was followed by the sound of a heavy door closing.</p>

  <p>The warriors immediately turned around in surprise. There was no door between the two pillars, so where had this sound come from?</p>

  <p>Hailey's brows slightly furrowed in thought. Taking light steps, she charged toward the space between the two pillars and reached out with her hands.</p>

  <p>"The door is closed," she said softly.</p>

  <p>Curiosity appeared on all their faces. They all walked back and reached out their hands like Hailey.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, they found an invisible door between these two pillars.</p>

  <p>"Since the door is closed, we will continue to move forward. I assume that none of you wants to leave, right?" Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>They had fought very hard to finally reach this place, so naturally, none of them would be willing to give up. From the second to the fourth halls, they had received an astonishing number of Illusion Points. What would the fifth hall bring them?</p>

  <p>"Meow," the flame kitten in Janet's arms whimpered lightly. Janet laughed and said, "Look, Flame agrees. Let's keep going."</p>

  <p>Women were creatures of emotion. In just a short period of time, Janet had already given the flame kitten a name: Flame.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ancestral Dragon had followed Luo Zheng for a long time, yet he still hadn't given it a name. In fact, he had never even thought about giving it a name.</p>

  <p>Janet didn't have a contractual beast, so she didn't have a spirit beast bag with her. Now, she could only hold the flame kitten in her arms.</p>

  <p>Just as she finished her words, a thin bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky above the mountain peak. The lightning extended all the way down and wrapped itself around a stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Just as the lightning struck the stone pillar, countless fragments began to appear at the top of the pillar. They constantly regrouped around the pillar and soon, a small portion of the roof appeared.</p>
