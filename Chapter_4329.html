<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4329 The Last Downgrading </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the Evil God was in the third-grade world, his state of mind had transformed.</p>

  <p>From being a troublemaker, he became a controller. After controlling the Black Ship, a province, and the whole Source World, he began to respect order and even maintain order.</p>

  <p>However, when the chaos ended, his Source World was destroyed. He lost everything he owned, including the black ship and his beloved wife. He was left all alone.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he began to hate the world again and wanted to destroy it even more.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng was the only other living creature in the area, the Evil God vented his anger on him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, a huge, long, and colorful line appeared.</p>

  <p>It was an energy plate, which looked about ten billion miles in length. The energy plate was so gigantic that it looked like an ocean, which could easily drown Zheng with its multi-colored energy waves.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>An octagon-shaped blue energy shield surrounded Zheng, blocking the gigantic, powerful energy trying to attack him. While he was dealing with this, he tried to appeal to the Evil God. He said, "What if we can bring back everything we had in the past?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!" the Evil God replied with frustration.</p>

  <p>The colorful energy began to change its hue. Several colors disappeared, leaving behind the red and blue colors. The red and blue energies melted into each other until they became one single color: purple.</p>

  <p>Although the ocean of purple energy looked beautiful, it was more destructive. It was destroying Zheng's energy shield much more effectively.</p>

  <p>Thinking on his feet, Zheng quickly changed his energy shield, blocking the purple energy. He was becoming more and more frustrated with the Evil God's attacks, but he still tried to communicate with him.</p>

  <p>"No! I mean it.</p>

  <p>Clarence is the controller, which means he has all the memories.</p>

  <p>If the whole world is restarted, all realities will be realized. The energy and materials will be restored. Everything in the past will reappear!"</p>

  <p>Zheng screamed through the noise, doing his best to persuade the Evil God.</p>

  <p>When he said this, the Evil God began to listen, putting his attacks on Zheng on hold. The purple energy calmed down, gently gathering around Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Then who will make all of this reappear?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>"I will," Zheng answered with no hesitation.</p>

  <p>"By devouring me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"No way!" the Evil God retorted. He never trusted Zheng, and Zheng never trusted him.</p>

  <p>When they were in the third-grade world, they could not put their distrust aside and reconcile their differences. The same happened in the second-grade world.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God finished talking, he launched another round of attacks on Zheng. The once gentle purple energy began to charge at Zheng again.</p>

  <p>While this was happening, the downgrader made his move quickly.</p>

  <p>The scope of the second-grade world was different from those of the other worlds. The spiritual sense in the second-grade world reached about thirty billion times further than it would in the third-grade world. Even more, the range of movement in the second-grade world was thirty billion times larger than that of the third-grade world.</p>

  <p>The downgrader wanted to find Clarence, so he quickly spread out his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>After spatial transference, he released his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>After another spatial transference, he released his spiritual sense for the second time.</p>

  <p>In just a short period, the downgrader had already moved far from where he was. His spiritual sense had already swept through a large area.</p>

  <p>"Lines, lines, lines...</p>

  <p>There are lines everywhere!</p>

  <p>Eh? The flower blossoming in the fourth-grade world has actually been preserved very well. It's a shame that only I can see and appreciate it," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>Even after crossing such a long distance, the downgrader still couldn't find Clarence. He became more and more frustrated.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>He used the spatial transference again, but only this time, he felt an energy wave back.</p>

  <p>Although the energy wave was very weak, it was active. 'Those low-level worms couldn't have released this. That would be impossible, ' the downgrader thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"That direction!" He said, going on.</p>

  <p>After feeling the small clue, the downgrader used the spatial transference over and over again. Each time he used the spatial transference, he felt the energy wave becoming stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>"Could it be? Could this energy wave be coming from Clarence? If it is, what is he doing? No threat in the second-grade world would need such energy," the downgrader said in confusion.</p>

  <p>After using the spatial transference hundreds of times, he reached the area where Zheng and the Evil God were battling each other.</p>

  <p>As he stepped foot within the area, Zheng and the Evil God immediately sensed his presence.</p>

  <p>Although the downgrader's form had changed a lot, they could still tell it was him by his aura.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A thin, purple line appeared in front of the downgrader. He used his spiritual sense to check what it was.</p>

  <p>He discovered it was a huge sea of energy. In its center was a human-shaped creature. This only made the downgrader even more confused.</p>

  <p>Was this Clarence? Did he morph into a human form?</p>

  <p>From what the downgrader remembered about Clarence, Clarence didn't like the human form, but the sea of energy was made by him. What was it for?</p>

  <p>As the downgrader was thinking about this, the space behind him began to fluctuate. After a few seconds, from it appeared a powerful bug with sharp spikes.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are. Don't you even dare move," the bug said through its spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>When the downgrader heard the bug's voice, he felt a shiver run up his spine.</p>

  <p>The bug was none other than the Evil God!</p>

  <p>'How is this even possible? How is he here?</p>

  <p>Only Clarence and I could survive the Wall World, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"How... How did you even survive?" the downgrader asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God didn't say anything. Instead, he stabbed his sharp spikes into the downgrader. The spikes' turbulent flames pierced through the downgrader's body, causing an intense burning sensation to spread through it.</p>

  <p>The downgrader's body was huge and broad, but in the blink of an eye, it burned into ashes.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God was in the third-grade world, he didn't take the downgrader seriously. The same went for the second-grade world. Right after he killed the downgrader, he turned around and continued to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the Wall World's black light emerged the downgrader, who was able to come out of the Evil God's attack reborn, although ashen.</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>He was furious.</p>

  <p>He couldn't accept that the Evil God had escaped his downgrading.</p>

  <p>'This is a humiliation!</p>

  <p>A great humiliation!</p>

  <p>The Wall World couldn't kill them. What about the World of Nothingness?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The first-grade World of Nothingness was very special.</p>

  <p>It had everything, but at the same time, it had nothing. Even the downgrader couldn't understand how this worked, but he was sure that the Evil God wouldn't have been able to survive it.</p>

  <p>In a burning rage, the downgrader's mental state began to decline.</p>

  <p>'Begin to downgrade!</p>

  <p>In the World of Nothingness, nothing can exist. You are not the exception!</p>

  <p>You can not survive!' the downgrader thought resentfully.</p>

  <p>The Wall World shook gradually until it started to shrink from the edge to the center. The black light in the center of the world transformed into a vortex, pulling everything from the world down to its dark core.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Evil God, who were still attacking each other, felt a great traction force, making them pause their fight.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and the energy sea became distorted.</p>

  <p>He and the Evil God were unable to resist the traction force happening in the Wall World.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?" Zheng asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>"It's Mastema. He's begun a new round of downgrading," Clarence answered.</p>

  <p>"A new round of downgrading?" Zheng said, stunned by what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Mastema must have been very furious with you two to have done this. This time, we will be entering the World of Nothingness," Clarence continued. "That will be his final destination."</p>
