  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he realized that his saber had been cut straight off, Timotheus' heart sank.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's identity was of great importance to the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Timotheus didn't want Luo Zheng to take too much risk. Hence, he was more willing to protect him.</p>

  <p>In spite of his will, after the Strength Equalizing token had been activated, Luo Zheng's performance was outstanding, and persuading him had become a difficult - if not impossible - task.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for all the warriors involved, Luo Zheng had truly displayed his extraordinary talents and he led everyone safely into the city.</p>

  <p>Now that they had faced the Warden race, they found themselves trapped in another desperate situation. Had he known what was to come, never would he have brought Luo Zheng to this place.</p>

  <p>Just when Timotheus was at a complete loss and felt like nothing could get any worse, a whirlpool suddenly appeared in the sky above.</p>

  <p>"This token..." he uttered.</p>

  <p>The ray of star light reflected itself in Timotheus' old eyes, now shining with a green hue.</p>

  <p>After Emily threw her annular saber out, she jumped up into the air and hooked her arm onto a beam of the roof, hanging herself in midair.</p>

  <p>As she performed this movement, she was very anxious, without a doubt.</p>

  <p>Although she was extremely powerful, her special skills and theurgies didn't work to her advantage now.</p>

  <p>'You must rely on yourself, Luo Zheng, ' Emily thought to herself.</p>

  <p>She believed in miracles, because the mere process of her growing up was a miracle in and of itself. She knew that Luo Zheng could perform his own kind of miracle.</p>

  <p>And she was right. His results truly didn't disappoint her. Beneath the light, she smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>Bergen hadn't imagined that Luo Zheng would apply this token whatsoever.</p>

  <p>To the contrary, he'd thought that his sword strike would kill Luo Zheng directly, seeing as he was standing no more than a foot away from him.</p>

  <p>The starlight had instead smashed his heavy sword to pieces.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as the starlight hit Bergen's heavy sword, the vast amount of blue energy spread quickly and the sword broke in an instant.</p>

  <p>Bergen's right hand that held the heavy sword also let out a crisp snapping sound. He hadn't had any time to withdraw his hand from the sword hilt. Under the great pressure from the huge force, his arm broke.</p>

  <p>Once the starlight had effectively smashed the heavy sword, it crashed to the ground, forming a black crater the size of a watermelon. The deep, dark crater appeared bottomless.</p>

  <p>As he watched what was going on, Bergen fell into a daze. Adrenaline rushed through him to such an extent that he completely forgot the pain from the broken bone in his arm.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think is going to come save you now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at Bergen coldly and smiled, raising his right hand above his head again.</p>

  <p>Another Truth Crystal was condensed and began rotating. It quickly picked up speed.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a second green whirlpool appeared in the sky, and a little star was produced from the latter.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the situation wasn't good, Bergen didn't hesitate a second more and retreated quickly.</p>

  <p>Despite his quick act, it was already too late. The star began falling fast.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't been deprived of their cultivation by the Strength Equalizing token, they would have been able to dodge the falling star.</p>

  <p>With his physical body's current state though, it was simply impossible for Bergen to escape.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The starlight smashed down onto him and crushed half of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>By the time it had fallen to the ground and exploded, it had devoured his entire body.</p>

  <p>Bergen died on the spot.</p>

  <p>Arvin and Bonnie weren't far away. Both of their faces were full of panic at the scene that played out before them. Furthermore, their undulating chests indicated their great unease.</p>

  <p>Sure, they were always on bad terms with Bergen, but they were still very sad to see Bergen die in such a miserable manner.</p>

  <p>More importantly, even Bergen had been killed by Luo Zheng! Who was ever going to stop Luo Zheng now?</p>

  <p>For their race, there was just no way back now.</p>

  <p>Arvin and Bonnie were leaders. Even if they knew that they were no match for Luo Zheng, they still couldn't retreat or run away. They had no choice but to show themselves confidence.</p>

  <p>"Arvin!"</p>

  <p>Determination flashed in Bonnie's eyes. She wasn't ready or willing to give up!</p>

  <p>Arvin nodded back in response.</p>

  <p>Before the battle had even begun, they had already made up their minds that they would fight to the end. It didn't matter if they had to risk their lives or even die.</p>

  <p>Even now, the Warden race still had chances of pulling through. As long as they could kill Luo Zheng in front of them, they were willing to risk their lives in order to perish together along with him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Arvin and Bonnie began running in circles around Luo Zheng, while pushing the blue energy to its extreme.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Bonnie was now running at full speed. The flying knives drew thin white lines in the air as they came straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just recently broken away from the cage that they had created.</p>

  <p>How could he possibly repeat the same mistake?</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, he jumped to the right and charged toward Bonnie.</p>

  <p>"Bonnie!"</p>

  <p>Also watching what was happening, Arvin was in great shock. As he rushed over to Bonnie, he controlled the butterflies in order to make them surround Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly ran over to the long sword inserted by the roadside and picked it up.</p>

  <p>As the green light flashed, Luo Zheng quickly bombed the butterflies outward, and the distance separating him and Bonnie quickly decreased.</p>

  <p>Gritting her teeth, Bonnie became ruthless. Instead of retreating, she confronted Luo Zheng with might.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!"</p>

  <p>She charged toward Luo Zheng and the flying knives in her hand exploded at the same time. They formed a jumble of fragments that covered him in an instant.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to be hit by one of these fragments, his whole body would be beaten to pieces.</p>

  <p>Arvin, who crept in from behind Luo Zheng, also summoned a large number of butterflies, once again forming a siege.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate at all, not even for a split second. He stopped straight in his tracks as he reached out his hand and flicked it.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>A starlight zipped toward Arvin.</p>

  <p>Arvin had witnessed the green starlight's power before. When he saw Luo Zheng casually moving his hand in this way, his heart skipped a beat and he immediately jumped backward. He knew what was coming.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, he succeeded in avoiding the falling starlight.</p>

  <p>Despite such, just as he avoided the starlight, a flying knife as thin as a cicada's wing zoomed straight at him, slicing through the air with grace.</p>

  <p>Before Arvin could even land back on the ground, his neck was cut by the flying knife. Blood began spurting from his neck, and he knelt down, covering his wound with both his hands and rolling on the ground. To a mortal's body, this kind of injury was generally fatal.</p>

  <p>"Arvin!"</p>

  <p>Bonnie cried, her young face twisting in sadness. Her pain was obvious to all.</p>

  <p>In a heartfelt rage, Bonnie rushed toward Luo Zheng with two flying knives in her hands. She was ready to take her revenge!</p>

  <p>She, of course, was no match for Luo Zheng, especially not in such a close combat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his sword in the air several times, causing the flying knives in Bonnie's hand to break into pieces. At last, he stabbed his sword directly between her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he spat as he performed his final attack.</p>

  <p>Bonnie was courting her death. In both Bonnie's and Arvin's eyes, Luo Zheng saw nothing but helplessness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's goal was opposite to theirs, and thus, his only resort was to kill them both. There was no right or wrong in this battle.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had killed Bonnie, Arvin and Bergen all in a row, the Warden race's situation changed drastically.</p>

  <p>These three warriors were the leaders of the three Warden race' teams.</p>

  <p>As they died one after the next in such quick succession, the Warden race's morale had greatly decreased. No one was willing to fight anymore.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the people wearing black robes fled in disarray.</p>

  <p>A few of them were even killed in all the chaos.</p>

  <p>The few of them who struggled really hard were quickly surrounded and killed.</p>

  <p>After a while, the area quieted down once more, leaving nothing but a strong, disheartening smell of blood.</p>
