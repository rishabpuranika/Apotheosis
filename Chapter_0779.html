<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Imogen pointed her walking stick toward the door and tried to ram it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Aside from a muffled sound, the small door simply remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>All of the people shot glances at each other in utter horror. God knew what Ning Yudie could have come up against upon entering that door.</p>

  <p>The look on Luo Zheng's face went dark. Stretching out his arm, he reached for another small door right next to the one Ning Yudie had chosen, and opened it.</p>

  <p>He went in just as well, but on the very instant he had done so, he felt an immense force dragging him further in. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't resist the mysterious force pulling him in, so much so that he didn't have a chance to go back anymore.</p>

  <p>The door immediately flung shut behind him.</p>

  <p>Now, it wasn't as surprising that Ning Yudie somehow let the door shut behind her as well. There was no way for her to go back where she came from upon walking into the door after all.</p>

  <p>At the end of it, Luo Luo Zheng had found himself in the middle of a jet-black space.</p>

  <p>Setting aside the light shining in front of him, everything else had been swallowed by the darkness.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing else I can do but to grit my teeth and keep moving forward." Luo Luo Zheng paced forward and got himself engulfed by the darkness, with nothing but the light at the end of that passage guiding him. Soon enough, he stepped into the light and exited the dark tunnel. By then, he suddenly found himself on some kind of platform, which was about ten feet long and five feet wide.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!" Yudie's voice came from his left side.</p>

  <p>Confirming that Ning Yudie was safe and sound, Luo Luo Zheng was finally able to feel at ease. She was there standing on a platform right next to the one he was on.</p>

  <p>The gap between the two platforms was but a couple of feet. A mature person could probably make it through with just a single step, but the second Luo Luo Zheng tried to walk over to where she was, an emerald green enchanted barrier stopped him in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of this?" Luo Luo Zheng had confusion written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Leaning over toward one side of the platform, Ning Yudie used her fingers to inspect its bounds. As her fingertips got into contact with the edge of the platform, an emerald green enchanted barrier promptly rose up as well. "An enchanted barrier has been put up around the platform. I don't think there's a way for you to get through it."</p>

  <p>Realizing the futility of trying too much, Luo Luo Zheng decided to examine the things around him in the meantime.</p>

  <p>They were in a massive, ring-shaped dark chasm. He tried to peer into the seemingly endless darkness, and true enough, he couldn't see the bottom at all. The only thing he could lay his eyes on was the multiple layers of the darkness, making it look as though this was actually some kind of gateway leading to hell itself. That being said, in front of Luo Luo Zheng, as well as to both his left and right sides, was a blanket of an emerald green enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Even if he were to decide that he wanted to jump straight into that darkness, he wouldn't be able to do so.</p>

  <p>This chasm could be anywhere between four or five thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>Upon looking around, Luo Luo Zheng took notice of the fact that there were nine areas somewhat identical to the one surrounding him. And within those areas, there were about forty to fifty platforms sticking out.</p>

  <p>"Nine." For a while, he had been so deep in thought. The number "nine" probably stood for the nine enchanted lamps.</p>

  <p>Taking into consideration that all of the nine enchanted lamps had been enkindled, it would be reasonable to think that nine powers should have entered the celestial tomb. But in spite of that, they didn't chance upon any other powers on their way there, so it appeared that they were actually heading to different paths and would eventually gather in this place at some point.</p>

  <p>With that being the case, what was Immortal Mist's intention?</p>

  <p>Could he have possibly fabricated an overwhelming death trap to lead everyone to this mysterious place?</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was still pondering about the situation, Imogen had also passed through the small door already, stepping foot onto a platform to the left of Yudie's. And one by one, the other members of the Cloud Hall appeared on each of the platforms.</p>

  <p>Moments after each person had filled a platform, someone suddenly showed up right in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit! Members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect!"</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng saw more people continuously appear on the platforms right in front of him. At the end of it all, he counted around thirty-four of them.</p>

  <p>This just showed that the Ethereal Spirit Sect had dispatched at least thirty-four people to enter the celestial tomb this time.</p>

  <p>"Imogen, I never would have imagined that the Cloud Hall would actually possess an enchanted lamp." The instant Xander stepped foot onto his platform, a smile crept onto his face.</p>

  <p>Imogen, albeit faintly, politely smiled back at him and responded, "Never in my wildest dreams had I ever thought that one of the nine enchanted lamps would somehow end up being in the hands of the Ethereal Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>In all of the Central Region, lots of warriors had been wondering who possibly could have been taking care of the nine enchanted lamps for the past hundreds of years. And at that point, it was clear as day that the answer to that question was about to be revealed.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!" A somewhat playful voice called out to him from the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shifted his gaze over to where the voice was coming from and let out a feeble smile. As it turned out, it was Brent, the one who was a divine-level talent from the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"You still owe me a fight!" No matter how childish the voice sounded, it was still rather coherent and firm.</p>

  <p>Shrugging it off, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "We'll see about that if the opportunity presents itself."</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had actually withdrawn from the Martial Arts Contest at the last minute, Brent was the one who had gotten most dispirited. He had always lamented the idea that he wasn't able to get the chance to fight Luo Luo Zheng head-on.</p>

  <p>It reached the extent that he even mentioned it repeatedly upon coming back to the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take your word for that!" Brent blurted out while pulling a face.</p>

  <p>"Hmm." Luo Luo Zheng just gave him a weak response. In this situation, he couldn't be bothered to worry about the little child.</p>

  <p>During the Martial Arts Contest, Eddie had mentioned at some point that he was a holder of an enchanted lamp. With that in mind, he should also be showing himself any minute now.</p>

  <p>And while he had been pondering about that, a strong and powerful voice suddenly resounded throughout the chasm, "It seems we meet again, boy."</p>
