<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2074 The Pill Refining Room (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Why not just go inside?" Saul said with a smile and a gentle expression.</p>

  <p>"This is what your master has left for you."</p>

  <p>Bromley had made some arrangements before he left the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>After he considered Luo Zheng's talents, Bromley expected Luo Luo Zheng to be able to make it through the True Path and open the different places of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head as he decided to follow Saul's suggestion. The main door of the pill refining room was already open, so Luo Luo Zheng walked through it with hopeful eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped into the pill refining room, he instantly felt as if the brown fog around him was a real substance. The fog was so condensed and heavy that Luo Luo Zheng felt like he was surrounded by water as he walked. There was even a slight resistance force in this fog that tried to push him out. Additionally, the medical fragrance he inhaled tasted bitter. Luo Luo Zheng felt that his nostrils were filled with rich bitterness.</p>

  <p>"What's this fog? I can't see anything!"</p>

  <p>Due to the obstruction of the brown fog, Luo Zheng's vision was very clouded.</p>

  <p>Irritability began to invade his eyes. Soon, it began to hurt even to look.</p>

  <p>Pain enveloped his pupils and eyelids. He could only close his eyes and release his soul force to sense everything in the pill refining room.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Luo Luo Zheng released his senses, he was startled. He noticed that there was a strange face in front of him. The face looked extremely ferocious. Sharp teeth and a powerful jaw armed the face. It opened its mouth and was about to bite Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tilted to the side and dodged the bite. At the same, he tried to counter-attack and threw a kick to the face.</p>

  <p>"Waah!"</p>

  <p>A loud scream echoed, and the face immediately disappeared into the brown fog.</p>

  <p>The human face had finally disappeared. However, more human faces with their mouths wide open came out of the brown fog from different directions. Each of the faces tried fiercely to bite Luo Luo Zheng. He even doubted that he had not entered a pill refining room, but ended up in some evil and wicked place?</p>

  <p>"What the hell? This is what Holy Bromley left for me? What are his intentions?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately threw dozens of punches to the faces. With speed as fast as the wind. Luo Zheng's fists shattered the faces in front of him one by one.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of such weird things. Worse enemies were defeated by him before. However, just as Saul had said, the objects in this pill refining room were left behind by Holy Bromley. Who would have thought that such a bunch of weird faces would appear and attack him?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was entirely at a loss about his stressful situation.</p>

  <p>Saul stood at the door and smiled. A mild voice came out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Actually, the more of these things, the better."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. There was confusion reflected in his eyes as he raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"These things are all pill souls, I thought that if there were two or three of them in the pill refining room, it would be excellent, but I didn't expect there to be so many." Saul continued to explain with a calm voice,</p>

  <p>"The ranks of the medicinal pills in the divine land are decided by how many times they are refined. The worst ones are the one time refined pills, while the best are nine times refined pills. Only the seven times, eight times, and nine times refined pills will be able to form spirits. They are powerful yet harder to produce. After a long time, they would condense pill souls."</p>

  <p>Everything had a spirit. The mountains had the mountain spirit, the earth had the earth spirit, and as the golden pills were refined, they gathered the most intelligent spirits in the entire divine land. Therefore, the spirit of the pills was naturally something that the spirit of common things could not compare. The numerous souls that attacked Luo Luo Zheng were evidence that the pills were of high quality.</p>

  <p>Once a seven times refined pill was created, it would have a free spirit.</p>

  <p>The spirit would grow even stronger as time passed. Afterward, a soul of nature would be born from the spirit of the pill. The shapes of those pill souls were initially strange and amorphous. However, the pill souls around Luo Luo Zheng all condensed into human faces. There must be some reasons behind it.</p>

  <p>"Are seven times refined pills good?" A curious tone accompanied Luo Zheng's query.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had rarely used any pills since he began his cultivation. As such, he had no idea about the ranks of the pills in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Haha." Saul laughed but didn't answer. However, the message behind his chuckle was apparent to Luo Luo Zheng. Presumably, pills that were ranked as seven times refined pills were no ordinary objects. They were extremely rare and exceptional, even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's continuous strikes, the strange faces were all destroyed.</p>

  <p>Soon the brown fog that floated around the pill refining room also gradually dissipated. Although the fragrance of the medicine was still repugnant, its scent had begun to weaken.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had opened his eyes again, he could finally see everything in the pill refining room clearly?</p>

  <p>Although the pill refining room was small, everything was arranged in an orderly manner. On three sides of the room, there were exquisite wooden cabinets. Within the shelves, there were little golden cauldrons that contained medicinal pills the size of eyeballs. The patterns on the surface of these medicinal pills were all different. Additionally, the color and smell of the pills were different too. As different kinds of fragrances gathered together, it formed the extremely strong scent that Luo Luo Zheng had smelled before.</p>

  <p>However, the most noticeable thing in the pill refining room was the round furnace in the center. On top of the furnace, there was a purplish- gold square lid. The lid constantly moved up and down as if something inside of it wanted to jump out and escape.</p>
