<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It looks like if I fail or even flutter, I'm going to die," Zheng muttered softly.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" The strong men across the ravine grabbed the rope, drew a circle and tied it around their shoulders. Then they motioned Zheng to tie himself with the rope, just as they did by imitating their actions.</p>

  <p>"Is the test of strength a tug of war? How could I possibly match the strength of 100 men all by myself?" Zheng, grasping the powerful men's intention and the test's concept, gently swung the rope and tied it around his shoulder in a strong loop.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng tugged at the rope and nodded at those men. The test of strength had been initiated.</p>

  <p>"Hey-oh!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden roar, the hundred intimidating men began to pull at the rope as hard as they could.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was well prepared, he suddenly lost his strong footing due to the sheer force of the hundred mighty men and slowly slid toward the cliff's edge.</p>

  <p>After being dragged six or seven steps toward the opposite side, Zheng put an end to it with all the strength he could muster. His feet gripped the ground, like a bull, and he stopped sliding as he adjusted to the steady position.</p>

  <p>"This strength test is not so easy to pass and is deceptively tough!" Zheng tried to lean back, stretching the rope straight and asserting more strength.</p>

  <p>The collective strength of a hundred men was so great that despite his best efforts, Zheng was dragged towards the cliff's edge.</p>

  <p>Zheng had not launched the power of dragon scales just as yet. He relied solely on his own strength against the strong men.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth, flexed every muscle and every tendon bulged.</p>

  <p>However, even with all his strength, he could not hold his ground and slid toward the cliff's edge inch by inch.</p>

  <p>'This is the limit of my physical strength, ' Zheng realized. 'I'm only two or three steps away from the drop. If I don't utilize the power of dragon scales, I'm afraid I will fall into the ravine!'</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted, and the dragon scales lit up in his head, giving off a green glow. Then, a rush of strength pushed into every muscle of his body like a sudden surge of electricity.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Zheng's power had exploded beyond what he expected!</p>

  <p>Upon Zheng's sudden surge of tremendous power, the rope creaked, and the hundred strong men were shocked into a movement towards the cliff's edge!</p>

  <p>Just moments before the mighty men standing across were about to fall into the ravine, they suddenly let out a roar again at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Hey-oh!"</p>

  <p>The hundred men simultaneously pulled the rope and withstood the test of power while stopping it from moving toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng and the strong men were in a match all over again!</p>

  <p>'How did that happen?' Zheng's mind was bubbling with curiosity. Over a hundred dragon scales inside his body had been ignited, and the force of each dragon scale was very terrifyingly mighty, not at the very least weaker than the strength of any man standing across him.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Zheng was barely able to withstand the power of these men only based on his physical strength. So now he activated the power of dragon scales, and his power would greatly surpass that of his opponents.</p>

  <p>But with a loud yell, yet again the strong men actually steadied the rope!</p>

  <p>What did this mean?</p>

  <p>It simply meant that the strength of those men was not fixed and varied depending upon the opposition. As Zheng's strength grew, so did their strength to level the field.</p>

  <p>With the rope on Zheng's shoulder, Zheng used his overwhelming strength to confront the strong men in the dual yet again.</p>

  <p>Neither side would budge and it grew tedious. Whenever Zheng took a few steps back, the men then pulled him forward a few steps.</p>

  <p>As a result, the tug-of-war became like a game of seesaw, with one side retreating and the other moving forward and then vice versa.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brow furrowed at the situation.</p>

  <p>'It can't go on like this!' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The men across him, his competitors were not real beings, but were magically made by the owner of this fairy palace with the help of illusions.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this proved their strength was simply inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>Unlike their unwavering strength, not only would Zheng's strength fail, but his dragon scales would deter after overuse and needed a little rest before he could recover.</p>

  <p>Evidently, if it went on like this, sooner or later Zheng's strength would be exhausted and he would be dragged into the abyss by those men standing across him!</p>

  <p>'I must win this situation as soon as possible. The more time this takes the lesser chances I have, ' Zheng told himself.</p>

  <p>But all of this was easier said than done. This strength test was too difficult than what he first anticipated!</p>

  <p>"Boy, having a tug-of-war with a hundred people does not require only strength, as one may think, but also skills!" Saul's voice came through again motivating him. "If you had paid attention to the minute details, you'd have figured it out by now!"</p>

  <p>"Details?" Zheng was startled for a second upon listening to Saul.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I can't tell you what they are. If I give you too many hints, I might be wiped out, so that's all I can say. The rest is up to you and I have said enough," Saul said in a soft motivating tone.</p>

  <p>'Details?' Zheng was lost in thoughts. 'On the face of it, the strength test seems like an unsolvable puzzle.</p>

  <p>The strength of the hundred men opposite is equal to mine each time. So, when my strength is increased ten times, the strength of the opposite too will be increased ten times, and when my strength is increased a hundred times, the strength of the opposite will also be increased to the same level to balance the scales and make it a fair match.</p>

  <p>That is to say, no one can win the opposition.</p>

  <p>So what are these minuscule details?</p>

  <p>There are a hundred mighty men...</p>

  <p>When I pull the rope hard, they too pull it with equal might. The only difference is when they all tug at the rope together they all let out a roar.</p>

  <p>Why must they always roar?</p>

  <p>The roar... This difference doesn't enhance their strength. The immortal would not add any unnecessary element when setting the dreamland, so this was deliberately arranged and placed here. Everything has meaning and significance.'</p>

  <p>The thought of that terrifying roar reminded Zheng of a story he read as a child.</p>

  <p>It was the tale of Lancang River. There was a shallow section of the river which small boats could cross, but big ships could not maneuver through.</p>

  <p>In order for the big ship to pass smoothly, it must be pulled by men. Boat trackers pulled a ship along the shore with ropes on their backs, assisting the ship to move forward through the shallow water slowly yet steadily.</p>

  <p>But despite dozens of men were towing a ship, their power was uneven and insufficient. If there was no unified force, it was impossible to drag the ship deep in the mud.</p>

  <p>In order to combine the power of dozens of people, they would sing songs, which were actually some rhythmic slogans driving motivation and synchronous movements!</p>

  <p>These slogans were used to synchronise their movements and combine their forces to ensure mobility and success.</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, an idea suddenly occurred to Zheng!</p>
