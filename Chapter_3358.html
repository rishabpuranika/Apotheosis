  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've heard of them," Luo Zheng responded along with a nod.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was not merely aware of them.</p>

  <p>He had the full support of the Green Jade Civilization, one of the top ten civilizations.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's improvements on the Other Shore, the Green Jade Civilization would have a far-reaching advantage if they were to join the games again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Taiyi gazed deeply at Luo Zheng, as if deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Ever since the establishment of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he had seen a number of young people with extraordinary strengths and talents.</p>

  <p>However, no one had ever come close to Luo Zheng's excellence.</p>

  <p>After their short discussion, Eastern Emperor Taiyi found that Luo Zheng kept many secrets, which made him feel that he could not see him through.</p>

  <p>"You know much, but your cultivation is still too low," Eastern Emperor Taiyi muttered. "But as you know, the Chaotic Source World will be opened soon. For the Other Shore Realm warriors, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement is an important threshold they must cross. You must seize this opportunity."</p>

  <p>"I have been fully prepared," replied Luo Zheng, bowing his head.</p>

  <p>He had said this but in actuality, he was a little confused.</p>

  <p>Based on Chance's performance, the corporeal body of the Chaotic Source Realm proved to be very strong.</p>

  <p>However, if Luo Zheng absorbed a few more Shade Stones and used them to protect his body, he would surely have the physical strength as strong as those who went through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, maybe even stronger than them.</p>

  <p>Was it even necessary for the warriors at the Other Shore Realm to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement?</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, Luo Zheng left Eastern Emperor Taiyi's place.</p>

  <p>Their meeting didn't last long, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't actually given Luo Zheng anything. But at the end of the day, Luo Zheng had gotten exactly what he wanted, namely Eastern Emperor Taiyi's promise.</p>

  <p>There had to be countless rare treasures and theurgies in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but Luo Zheng wanted nothing to do with them. Moreover, he was not interested in garnering a bubble reputation.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng left, a person emerged from a corner in Eastern Emperor Taiyi's pavilion. The long cerise dress outlined her slim figure. It was Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, why didn't you summon me but Luo Zheng after you woke up?" said Concubine Yan, flustered and frustrated. Before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, she was a very gentle woman.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you know very well of Luo Zheng's importance," Eastern Emperor Taiyi responded, taking her in his arms. "If I get the Truth Enlightenment, I may be able to make a further breakthrough in swordsmanship."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you will make progress in swordsmanship sooner or later," she responded in a coquettish tone. "Take your time."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head. "In fact, there is not much time left.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, a catastrophe is happening on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"A catastrophe?" Concubine Yan gasped, holding her finger tips to her lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm afraid they are eager for action." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes revealed his worry. "At this point, it doesn't matter if I die. But I can't bear to see the countless living creatures in the Bloom Divine Province suffer."</p>

  <p>In the several provinces under the jurisdiction of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, many clans were thriving with populations of at least ten billion. If the Taiyi Heaven Palace became involved, how would these people ever be able to defend themselves?</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan noticed the look on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face and comforted him, "They were born at this time, so they won't be able to escape such a catastrophe. If we lose, they will have nowhere to stay in the whole chaos, let alone the Bloom Divine Province. Unless they have the needed qualifications to hide on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>The only shield in the chaos was the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But who knew how many people could just hide on the Other Shore in a round of civilization?</p>

  <p>"Even if we escape to the Other Shore, we may not escape death," Eastern Emperor Taiyi continued.</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" Concubine Yan asked, wondering what could be so bad about the escape.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at her, seeing that she did not know much.</p>

  <p>"They want to destroy everything, including the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan's eyes grew wide, her hands suddenly covering her mouth. "What?!</p>

  <p>That's crazy!"</p>

  <p>Even if the chaos was destroyed, the supreme masters in the Source World would eventually have a way out. They could hide on the Other Shore to save themselves.</p>

  <p>This was the privilege of the strong.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan knew the consequences of destroying the Other Shore, so this idea took her by surprise.</p>

  <p>"I will not discuss this now." Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head, changing the subject. "Several days ago, you said you wanted a talk with me. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>In fact, Concubine Yan was going to ask Eastern Emperor Taiyi for help. She was at a loss of what to do with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>But when she needed help, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was still on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan smiled and said, "Don't worry about it. Feng Ge has recovered well."</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge? What happened to her?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked with concern. He was always concerned about his youngest daughter, Feng Ge, who had extraordinary talents.</p>

  <p>"She... She has become a purified being," Concubine Yan said.</p>

  <p>"A purified being?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned by the news.</p>

  <p>He knew exactly what purified being meant. A purified being was a powerhouse who ruled an entire stage on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Concubine Yan nodded.</p>

  <p>"How could this be possible? Purified beings only come from the Other Shore. How did Feng Ge become one?" This surprised Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"Actually, Luo Zheng has something to do with it," said Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>"It's him again!" After Eastern Emperor Taiyi departed from the Other Shore, he was able to gather interesting information that had something to do with Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng's name appeared too many times for him to forget it.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," Concubine Yan expressed. "But I'll make sure to explain it to you in detail."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned to the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, he saw that Nelly, Xun, and Liusu had packed their clothes and were about to leave.</p>

  <p>After everything that happened with Jean, it was pointless for them to stay at the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>However, just as they approached the gate of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, Feng Ge suddenly appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"You have recovered?" Luo Zheng asked with a genuine smile.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's posture was tall, and her expression was as cold as ice. She wore a long blue dress, looking quite elegant and sophisticated.</p>

  <p>It was hard to read her, especially with coldness in her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flame recorded everything. After Teague's memory was removed, her memory had been completely restored. This made everything clear to her, especially the incident in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Recalling that she had followed Luo Zheng like a little puppy, she blushed in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Little Master!"</p>

  <p>"Little Master, you've finally recovered!"</p>

  <p>Nelly, Liusu and Xun were happy to see Feng Ge healthy and well, most especially because of Feng Ge's kindness towards them all.</p>

  <p>"It seems that you're heading somewhere." Feng Ge blinked, looking at all the bags they carried. "Are you leaving?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Liusu responded. "Thanks to you in these days, our cultivation base has improved by leaps and bounds. But we seem to have offended Lady Jean, and we don't want to cause more trouble by staying in the Phoenix Palace."</p>

  <p>"Lady Jean? What happened?" Feng Ge frowned. She was unaware of this.</p>

  <p>"When you were gone, they..." Nelly told Feng Ge what had happened recently.</p>

  <p>After hearing Nelly's explanation, Feng Ge felt a chill come over her.</p>

  <p>"Chance? Ahmad? They are quite bold!" she sneered.</p>

  <p>No descendants of the Phoenix Palace ever dared to offend Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Even a Chaotic Source Realm cultivator like Chance would make a detour if he ever came across her.</p>

  <p>Little did she know that they started a fight when she was gone.</p>
