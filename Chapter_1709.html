<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1709 The Beginning Swordsmanship </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng's "No Move" was like a small snake that hovered in the air, poised to strike.</p>

  <p>After dodging Tianming's Soaring Snake, it lunged straight for his opponent's face.</p>

  <p>Facing this move, Tianming remained as indifferent as before. The Soaring Snake in his hand circled once, as three silver sword lights, like torrents of mercury, shot out from the wake he cut through the air.</p>

  <p>Ding, ding, ding!</p>

  <p>With three crisp ringing sounds, the three sword lights struck the body of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>It was like crushing a snake's head, one grinding step at a time.</p>

  <p>With every sword strike by the silver sword lights, the sword intent of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword would weaken a bit.</p>

  <p>After three strikes, the sword intent that had originally been condensed on the blade's surface was forcibly dispersed by Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Your sword moves do not offer you any advantage," Tianming said with an indifferent shrug.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike was indeed powerful, but Tianming's swordsmanship had proven to be even stronger!</p>

  <p>What he cultivated was the Beginning Swordsmanship created by the Lord of Weapons himself.</p>

  <p>In the universe, there were countless forms of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, all these had evolved from the Beginning Swordsmanship, which was the source of all forms of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Whether it was speed or sword moves, Zheng had been completely undone by Tianming.</p>

  <p>However, even though Tianming was clearly a superior swordsman, he did not let his guard down.</p>

  <p>He was convinced that it was impossible for Zheng to be so weak.</p>

  <p>However, after suppressing Zheng, Tianming gradually became emboldened, and his attacks increased in intensity, drawing power from his rising bravado.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Accompanying the sound was a brilliant silver sword light.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake was once again released. The mercury-like sword light began to flicker again as Tianming stepped on the light once more.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>As the swords clashed together, the sounds of steel grinding together rang out.</p>

  <p>Chop, slash, stab, tap...</p>

  <p>The Beginning Swordsmanship was very similar to the basic swordsmanship that Zheng had mastered early on.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it could be said that it was the complete version of the basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Combined with Tianming's innate speed, it appeared to be flawless.</p>

  <p>With Tianming now taking the initiative to attack, it was difficult for Zheng to avoid his opponent's sword moves. He could only passively defend and was forced to dodge and retreat.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming's speed was so fast that he seemed to be dancing with a glittering bolt of lightning. When he had stepped on the light, Zheng had already been surrounded by danger. Even after the Eight Smoky Melodies was activated, it was still proving difficult for him to dodge Tianming's attack.</p>

  <p>Strangely, Tianming didn't display any intention of ending this battle.</p>

  <p>Instead, he was extremely patient, and continued to wait.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I said so! Zheng is no match for Tianming."</p>

  <p>"He simply doesn't have the strength or the skill to fight back."</p>

  <p>"He lacks the advantage in sword moves, speed, and power. How could he be able to fight against Tianming?"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, I bet on Tianming. I'm going to win a large fortune."</p>

  <p>"What kind of swordsmanship is Tianming using? It appears to be exactly the same as the basic swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't Zheng capable of the same?"</p>

  <p>On the board, Zheng only moved about within a space of ten feet.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was different. He was like a butterfly, rapidly flurrying back and forth. Occasionally, he would stab Zheng with his sword. After pausing for a moment, he would then disappear.</p>

  <p>In the past, whenever Zheng had faced off against an opponent, his speed had always lent him the advantage.</p>

  <p>But now, even though Zheng had already activated his forceful energy and had used the Eight Smoky Melodies, he still wasn't able to follow his opponent's footsteps. He lagged behind, seeming almost lethargic when compared to Tianming.</p>

  <p>Against Tianming, Zheng was indeed at a very obvious disadvantage.</p>

  <p>However, as Tianming's sword strikes came slashing down from overhead, Zheng also entered into a state of enlightenment.</p>

  <p>"Tianming's swordsmanship..."</p>

  <p>The moves of the Beginning Swordsmanship were extremely simple and matched well with Zheng's basic swordsmanship. However, there was something in this Beginning Swordsmanship that Zheng couldn't fully understand.</p>

  <p>The momentum contained in the movements was a force that exceeded the bounds of basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's basic swordsmanship was rated as "one," then the Beginning Swordsmanship was a solid "zero." It had come first and was a foundation that Zheng lacked.</p>

  <p>It contained an extremely marvelous and fantastical momentum.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Zheng's perception had been lacking!</p>

  <p>After all, the momentum of the Beginning Swordsmanship had been accumulated by the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>This swordsmanship was called the Beginning Swordsmanship, and it was the foundation of all forms of swordsmanship. In terms of moves, it was original and simply unbreakable.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>When Tianming's sword came slashing down again, Zheng used the same sword move.</p>

  <p>The actions of the two were practically the same, but Zheng's sword attack was missing something vital.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was the form, speed, or momentum, Zheng's sword move remained inferior to Tianming's.</p>

  <p>'What exactly is missing?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>He held his sword horizontally, poised in front of his chest, as he stared at Tianming flying overhead.</p>

  <p>Tianming circled around in the distance before he returned to his original position. This time, the Soaring Snake circled around his side and savagely hacked straight at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng also slashed out vertically with this sword.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The blades of the two swords slipped away from each other as their paths crossed. However, in the moment that they met during the savage blow, a long and narrow gash appeared on Zheng's body, forming a zigzag line down his side.</p>

  <p>As for Tianming, he quickly moved out of range.</p>

  <p>"You are unable to break my sword moves. The difference between us is too big." Tianming held an overwhelming advantage, but he still addressed Zheng with full respect. In his eyes, however, there was a faint trace of disappointment.</p>

  <p>He had always seen Zheng as a true opponent! His strongest opponent!</p>

  <p>A few years ago, even if he were to run after Zheng at full speed, he would not have been able to catch up to him.</p>

  <p>But in just six or seven years, as he stood in front of Zheng again, he found that he had already surpassed this goal.</p>

  <p>Tianming did not like this feeling, and he felt cheated— Zheng could clearly be stronger!</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, a hint of frustration appeared in his eyes. With a thrust of his sword, he charged straight at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Zheng once again mirrored the same sword move as Tianming's.</p>

  <p>However, there was now something else in Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>After the two swords intersected, a look of surprise appeared on Tianming's face as he looked at Zheng. He stood rooted to the board as the beam of light beneath his feet slowly expanded.</p>

  <p>He had felt the momentum within Zheng's sword strike— it was the momentum within the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Even though it was still very insignificant, it was already in its infancy.</p>

  <p>"Things are getting interesting..."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tianming's eyes seemed to radiate with vigor and he smiled briefly.</p>

  <p>Beginning Swordsmanship...</p>

  <p>In order to acquire this sword technique, he had spent nearly three years in extensive practice.</p>

  <p>It had been three years in the outside world.</p>

  <p>In truth, while in the treasure trove of the Lord of Weapons, Tianming had been trapped there for three hundred years. The Time Law there had been altered, and the flow of time there was now at a ratio of 100 to 1.</p>

  <p>As the three hundred years had passed, he had repeatedly practiced the Beginning Swordsmanship, which was so similar to the basic swordsmanship, yet so significantly different.</p>

  <p>He had gained ten percent of the momentum after he had practiced for almost twenty years.</p>

  <p>After another eighty years, he had gained twenty percent.</p>

  <p>After a hundred and fifty years, thirty percent.</p>

  <p>Another two hundred and twenty years, forty percent.</p>

  <p>After a full three hundred years, he had finally obtained fifty percent of the momentum of the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Tianming had invested a total of three hundred years of his long life to master fifty percent of the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had already gained ten percent of its momentum, and it had happened in less than five minutes!</p>

  <p>'Through watching and testing my swordsmanship, has Zheng managed to comprehend the essence of the Beginning Swordsmanship? What a monster he is!' Tianming thought, with both awe and delight.</p>
