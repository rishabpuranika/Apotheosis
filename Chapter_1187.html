  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was no longer any need to avoid the Soul Purifying Light at the time Zheng and the other four rulers stepped onto the thirteenth floor given that it was the top floor.</p>

  <p>The top floor was an open, circular platform wherein one could enjoy the view of the entire Divine Emperor Secret Land - except, there wasn't really any view to enjoy. The entire scenery consisted of corpses and graveyards and nobody really appreciated looking at dead bodies.</p>

  <p>On the platform were coffins arranged in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>The corpses placed within the structure, from the first to the thirteenth floor, were no doubt core members of the Dragon Lineage Human. Each coffin that they had passed by on every floor was exquisitely well-crafted.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't compare to the coffins that were on the top floor.</p>

  <p>Mysterious divine textures had been carved onto the surface of the rich, elaborately crafted coffins.</p>

  <p>Most of the runes glowed brightly indicating their activation.</p>

  <p>Zheng was immediately filled with curiosity upon the sight. These divine textures needed a continuous supply of life vitality in order to keep running. Could it be that there was a massive life vitality crystal buried underneath this cemetery? It was the only explanation he could think of as he looked at these still-active runes.</p>

  <p>"How could this be? Just how many life vitality crystals could be enough to keep them active?" he couldn't help but voice out his thoughts. Zheng figured that not even one massive life vitality crystal would be enough to keep these divine textures running for thousands of years given that the Dragon Lineage Human had been destroyed in the blood sacrifice more than ten thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>Turner smiled at Zheng's puzzled expression. "These divine textures don't get energy through life vitality crystals! Just look at the ground and you'll understand."</p>

  <p>Zheng followed Turner's instructions and looked down. Indeed, there was a huge divine texture that was also carved onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng could recognize the divine texture and immediately understood.</p>

  <p>This was a seven-star divine texture - Spiritual Energy Gather. It was an extremely important divine texture, as emphasized by the cyan dragon when he taught Zheng the divine texture techniques.</p>

  <p>This Spiritual Energy Gather that the divine textures on the coffins relied on to keep running could continuously gather the spiritual energy between heaven and earth and transform it into life vitality.</p>

  <p>"However, these coffins are all engraved with divine textures. It would be a little difficult to occupy the bodies in the coffins, right?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The owners of these corpses were all at the top-level of Soul Sea Realm. They were probably stronger than us when they were alive,"</p>

  <p>Turner told him.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't wrong when he assumed that the bodies inside these coffins would be hard to occupy. In fact, there was only one successful case recorded in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>That was 36 years ago and the person that managed to do it was War King Wind. It was with the help of a powerful corpse from the thirteenth floor that he was able to further explore the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>However, that was the first and last time War King Wind had succeeded.</p>

  <p>The four country leaders had tried time and again to take over the corpses of the thirteenth floor but none of them ever succeeded. Every time they failed, they would be forced to take over the twelfth floor's corpses instead. From this, one could imagine how difficult it was to take over the top floor's corpses.</p>

  <p>"Why is it so difficult?" Zheng couldn't help but ask with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Even if these corpses had been top-level Soul Sea Realm masters and had been stronger than Turner and the others when they were alive, the gap shouldn't be that large. Turner, War King Wind, and the others were all at the top level of Soul Sea Realm, after all. The only reason why they hadn't gone any further with their cultivation was only due to the limited resources in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>"The reason is actually very simple," Turner said, smiling to him bitterly.</p>

  <p>"We can't remember any of their names."</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback by this explanation. It made him even more confused, "What?!"</p>

  <p>Turner's consciousness drifted over to communicate with him, "You will understand in a bit. The corpses here on the top floor belonged to the most important people in the Dragon Lineage Human. How can they allow other people to desecrate their bodies? Of course they'd make it hard for someone to occupy their bodies!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, Scott, and War King Wind walked along the platform followed closely by the other Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>Scott stopped in front of a snow-white coffin surrounded by several small trees. These trees had been growing by the side of the coffin for thousands of years now but not one was even tall enough as a person.</p>

  <p>"Name," Scott's consciousness spread out and asked the question.</p>

  <p>"The owner of this corpse was called Alessandro Feng. He was once the leader of the sacred land of the Dragon Lineage Human and has been dead for forty thousand years…" a Soul Sea Realm master answered.</p>

  <p>This was the Dragon Lineage Human's graveyard and those that lay here must have died long before their people's destruction.</p>

  <p>"Alessandro Feng? Alessandro Feng…" Scott's consciousness kept repeating the name.</p>

  <p>Scott's actions made Zheng even more curious. Was the name really that important? Why was there a need to repeat it over and over again? Zheng was completely at a loss.</p>

  <p>Once Scott repeated the name a couple dozen times, he called out, "Open the coffin, I'm ready!"</p>

  <p>It would be difficult for Scott, who was still in the form of his soul, to open the coffin given that his soul was still at the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Luckily, there were already many Soul Sea Realm warriors who had occupied bodies for their own.</p>

  <p>It wasn't as good as their own living, breathing bodies, but the Soul Sea Realm masters could still display around seventy percent of their full strength while occupying another's corpse. Several of them came over and attempted to open Alessandro Feng's coffin.</p>

  <p>An important figure surely had strong protective measures implemented in his final resting place. The coffin shook violently when the Soul Sea Realm masters made a move to open it and the divine texture carved on it flickered like crazy.</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz buzz…"</p>

  <p>As the coffin trembled, there was a loud, unmistakable roar of a fierce dragon!</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>A couple of small dragons formed by life vitality shot out from a divine texture and immediately headed for the Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>'A six-star divine texture, Cyan Dragon Seal, ' Zheng quickly realized as he looked at those small dragons.</p>

  <p>A five-star divine texture was enough to defend against a Life and Death Realm master while a six-star divine texture was enough to defend against a powerful Soul Sea Realm master!</p>

  <p>However, the six-star divine texture couldn't really go against so many powerful Soul Sea Realm masters that abounded on the platform.</p>

  <p>It also helped that the Soul Sea Realm masters that had opened the coffin were incredibly skilled. Right after they activated the Cyan Dragon Seal, they immediately gave up trying to open the coffin and lured the dragons to chase after them instead.</p>

  <p>Just as they ran away, several other powerful Soul Sea Realm masters approached the coffin and started attacking the six-star divine texture.</p>

  <p>The divine texture quickly shattered under their combined efforts which made the seven to eight small, life vitality dragons slowly dissipate as well.</p>

  <p>During this entire debacle, Scott merely stood to the side and continuously repeated Alessandro Feng's name over and over again. He didn't even pay any attention when the dragons suddenly showed up and tried to chase the others.</p>

  <p>'It looks like that name is really important, ' Zheng couldn't help but surmise.</p>

  <p>Once the defensive rune was broken, the Soul Sea Realm masters quickly put their borrowed bodies to work and slowly opened the coffin.</p>

  <p>Inside lay a silver-haired, middle-aged man - Alessandro Feng himself.</p>

  <p>Even with his eyes closed as a corpse, a powerful, domineering aura still emanated from him, indicating his superiority as a being.</p>

  <p>The four rulers also had this aura, but not as sharp as Alessandro Feng's.</p>

  <p>He was, undoubtedly, a top master at the Soul Sea Realm when he was still alive. Perhaps he was even the strongest martial artist of the great world during his time.</p>

  <p>Scott immediately grew wary as he was hit by the corpse's aura but he didn't dwell too much on it. He turned around and gave a nod to the other three rulers before suddenly jumping into the coffin.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered Alessandro Feng's body, Scott immediately stretched out his hand and pressed the spot between the corpse's eyebrows. The corpse opened its mouth as if on reflex and Scott's soul quickly entered through it.</p>

  <p>The Soul Core's power spread throughout the corpse's body very quickly.</p>

  <p>It went through its arms, legs, and viscera. Shortly after, the tall and sturdy body of Alessandro Feng crawled out from the coffin.</p>
