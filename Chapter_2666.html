<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2666 Breakthrough </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi wasn't someone who could get shocked easily.</p>

  <p>The divine land, after all, was just a world created in the chaos by Chiyou.</p>

  <p>The Source World remained as the main world of the whole chaos.</p>

  <p>There were just too many amazingly powerful people who had done unbelievable things there since ancient times.</p>

  <p>Fuxi pressed on the Eight Diagrams Chart with his finger. The sheet that had formerly covered Zheng's head suddenly returned to his hand.</p>

  <p>With the sheet no more, Zheng slowly opened his eyes and turned to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>He had just comprehended the Emotion Closing Godly Way but he wasn't about to leave just yet. Instead, Zheng chose to remain cross-legged by Fuxi's side.</p>

  <p>His incarnation was currently condensing in his inner world...</p>

  <p>Below the continent of Zheng's inner world, tens of thousands of Spiritual Darknesses shuttled through numerous, small, weaving caves.</p>

  <p>These Spiritual Darknesses had grown in number and were now divided into different forces.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, they would even fight each other for territory.</p>

  <p>Zheng's arrival did not attract the attention of anyone in his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, as a thought came to his mind, a force suddenly grasped the Spiritual Darknesses. They were suddenly pulled out of the complicated caves they resided in and unceremoniously thrown into the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop!"</p>

  <p>As soon as they hit the brown water, it immediately began to boil.</p>

  <p>Huge clouds then rose from the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at these clouds and his entire temperament suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>He had already cut-off all his emotions since he was in the state of Ripping Consciousness.</p>

  <p>His eyes might look energetic but there was no vigor in them.</p>

  <p>He was like a stone carving, or perhaps a frozen iceberg that had been submerged under the still oceans for thousands of years.</p>

  <p>With the change of his consciousness, the brown clouds began to emanate the aura of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, turning into sword clouds.</p>

  <p>These sword clouds were infinitely fiercer than the ones Zheng had made before.</p>

  <p>Once the Spiritual Darknesses turned into sword clouds, Zheng would then be able to use them in condensing his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>He was previously trapped in his own comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way which prevented him from reaching the consummate level. However, the situation was now different.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough!" he exclaimed. There was an evident frown on his face and the light in his eyes once again shone.</p>

  <p>"Formless State!"</p>

  <p>His aura changed once again. Zheng had now lost any form at this point.</p>

  <p>"Nothingness In One!"</p>

  <p>His aura surged in strength before gradually becoming weaker until it faded away.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he had completely comprehended the state of Nothingness In One.</p>

  <p>The world no longer existed for Zheng, and to the world, Zheng also did not exist.</p>

  <p>As his aura changed, so did the momentum from the sword clouds. The force that burst out had now actually doubled.</p>

  <p>The amount of the sword momentum was dozens of times higher than when Zheng was in the Ripping Consciousness state.</p>

  <p>Countless sword shadows circled the clouds as if a hidden sword kingdom hid there.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>An idea flashed through his mind and all the clouds rolled towards the Godly Tile and entered.</p>

  <p>Without the Infinity Ruler, Zheng could keep on comprehending the Emotion Closing Godly Way, use the Spiritual Darknesses to wash his Godly Tile and help him reach the higher cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng activated the Infinity Ruler, he absorbed way too many Godly Ways and was led astray to some extent. He had gotten absorbed in blending the Godly Ways which led to the slow progress in his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Now everything was back on track.</p>

  <p>This was also one of the reasons why Mike arranged for him to cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way. He needed to rely on a main part of the Godly Tile in order to become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>As Zheng concentrated on flushing the Godly Tile, he felt a sudden space fluctuation by his side.</p>

  <p>A figure suddenly appeared!</p>

  <p>The sight of this figure made him raise his eyebrows. "Evil God?"</p>

  <p>After leaving the divine land, Zheng had gotten too caught up with his affairs to take care of the people in his inner world.</p>

  <p>He could not help but look at Evil God in surprise. "You have proved the Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>"Creator," the Evil God muttered as he bowed to Zheng. His stance indicated respect but there was a noticeable gloom on his face. "My two grandsons and I have become True Gods... Moreover, I have comprehended all the Godly Ways arranged by you. However, my cultivation base is limited, and I can only comprehend twenty to thirty percent of them..."</p>

  <p>There was a noticeable sadness in his tone. Zheng had promised to let him be free but ended up disappearing for countless years!</p>

  <p>"You've comprehended hundreds of Godly Ways?" Zheng repeated in shock.</p>

  <p>He had initially absorbed hundreds of Godly Ways by means of the Infinity Ruler but never expected the Evil God to comprehend them. Zheng was indeed impressed by his talent.</p>

  <p>However, this did not mean that Zheng's comprehension was inferior.</p>

  <p>After all, the gap in the time flow rate was huge between the two places.</p>

  <p>Zheng had only spent a few years in the prison created by the Chaos Ancient God after leaving the divine land.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate within his inner world was much faster. The Evil God was incomparably strong and invincible in the inner world. He also spent most of his time focusing on cultivation. Thus, his cultivation speed was much faster.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the Evil God affirmed. "Creator, when will you let me go out of this world?"</p>

  <p>Zheng gave him a faint smile. "I have had a lot to deal with these past few years and have not given you a chance to go out. It won't be too long now though!"</p>

  <p>He had no intention of explaining the divine land and the outside world to the Evil God right now.</p>

  <p>It would be quite difficult for the Evil God to understand the structure of the outside world by mere description. He would only be able to do so after he entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's reply was enough to satisfy the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He could really do nothing else but wait. He had already waited for so long, so what was a few more years?</p>

  <p>During their conversation, the sword clouds had already merged into Zheng's Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>There was a thunderous sound that came from afar.</p>

  <p>It was then that a sharp light burst out from the Godly Tile and soared into the sky!</p>

  <p>The Evil God was clever and immediately realized that Zheng had just made a breakthrough in his cultivation base. He cupped his hands and bowed. "Congratulations Creator! Your cultivation base has reached a new level!"</p>

  <p>Only when Zheng's own cultivation was promoted could the creatures in his inner world also be qualified to reach a higher level. Seeing his Creator prosper filled the Evil God with joy, and perhaps it could be said that he was even happier than Zheng himself.</p>
