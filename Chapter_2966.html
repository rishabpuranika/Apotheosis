<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2966 The Ring Of Chaos Clouds </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng was curious about the relationship between Gerald and the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. However, No. 9527 was unwilling to reveal any details and so he had no way of learning the truth of it.</p>

  <p>Once he returned to the Trumpet Flying Ship, Leopold, Emily and the members of the Snake Goddess race were all staring at him, as if he were some sort of hideous monster.</p>

  <p>The Sky Rending Rhinoceros left, leaving the space pitch black. Everyone wasted no time in using their spiritual sense to explore their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Yan was smiling, thinking that this was a piece of cake for her brother, and she was so proud.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. The Sky Rending Rhinoceros has agreed to build a space cave that leads to the Source World for us. We should be very close to the Source World after we cross the space cave." Luo Zheng then added in response to the confused faces surrounding him, "Don't ask. I too do not understand what the Sky Rending Rhinoceros said."</p>

  <p>He had spoken with the Sky Rending Rhinoceros for a long while, and now he said he didn't understand what the Sky Rending Rhinoceros said. Luo Zheng was fooling no one.</p>

  <p>The others didn't question him on seeing the sincerity across his face.</p>

  <p>"I have to say, I didn't see us being able to take a shortcut like this, travelling through the space cave with the help of the Sky Rending Rhinoceros..." Emily said smiling joyfully.</p>

  <p>They had escaped danger, gotten the help of the Sky Rending Rhinoceros, and saved a lot of time. Everyone believed Luo Zheng was responsible for bringing this great fortune upon them.</p>

  <p>Leopold activated the Trumpet Flying Ship once more, continuing to advance silently through darkness.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a small white dot began to reveal itself in the distance.</p>

  <p>The white dot was like a tiny hole on a large black cloth. Although small, it was eye-catching in the darkness. The moment it appeared, Leopold had spotted it.</p>

  <p>"It's the other side of the space cave. The entrance is pure pitch black, and the exit is clean and brilliant white. Let's go over!" Emily was excited at the sight of white dot too.</p>

  <p>Leopold nodded and maneuvered the Trumpet Flying Ship to charge straight for the white dot.</p>

  <p>They were still tens of thousands of miles away and already the dot had become a huge stunning white cave.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship began to tremble with a loud sound. They were being pulled in by an inescapable gravitational force coming from the white cave.</p>

  <p>Eventually the ship dove right into the white cave. Everyone was covered in the dazzling light and forced to shut their eyes tighter than they ever did, desperately trying to avoid the blinding pain.</p>

  <p>Everyone began to feel that the Trumpet Flying Ship was clearly picking up speed. The whole ship shook violently and they held on tight, resisting the vibrations and intense speed. With a sudden stop, the Trumpet Flying Ship shot out of the white hole.</p>

  <p>It took around half a minute for Luo Zheng to finally open his eyes.</p>

  <p>The huge white hole had disappeared, and the brown chaos clouds had once again revealed themselves in front of him.</p>

  <p>"We're not in the Source World, are we?" All he saw were tens of gigantic chaos clouds forming a ring. The area around the clouds was still empty.</p>

  <p>Emily stared at the enormous mass of chaos clouds and a smile flashed onto her face. "Of course we are in the Source World now!"</p>

  <p>Leopold nodded in agreement. "If such a fierce beast like the Sky Rending Rhinoceros comes close to the Source World, it will cause disaster. It has indeed led us to the right destination."</p>

  <p>Seeing the puzzled faces of Luo Zheng and Yan, Emily pointed to the chaos clouds and said, "The Source World is right above those clouds! It's just that the chaos clouds cover the Source World. We'll be able to see it after passing through them."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's still a long way from here," Luo Zheng said, staring in awe at the huge clouds.</p>

  <p>How huge were the chaos clouds? Back when Luo Zheng was in the Immortal Mansion, he had learned from Bromley's travel notes that even the divine land was only a drop in the ocean when compared to the chaos cloud.</p>

  <p>A Source World needed tens of chaos clouds to cover it. It was even larger than what Luo Zheng had imagined. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>"It could possibly take three to four months to get close to it," Leopold announced.</p>

  <p>"We are already fast. It would only take less than six months for us to travel from the edge of the chaos to the Source World... The other guys are probably still at the edge. It would likely take twenty to thirty thousand years for them to make it here." Emily pursed her lips and smiled. She was ecstatic to have found this shortcut to the Source World.</p>

  <p>'The other guys' she mentioned were actually the Other Shore Realm warriors from the bone towers at the bottom of the chaos. They did not possess the help of divine crystals nor the Trumpet Flying Ship. They would fly across the chaos using only bodies. It would take a great deal of time, and they might encounter all manner of obstacles along the way.</p>

  <p>"Three to four months." Luo Zheng nodded contemplatively. After pondering a while, he asked Emily suddenly, "I want to create a Rebirth Land in my inner world and enfeoff it to someone. Do you know of any specific method?"</p>

  <p>"The Rebirth Land?" Emily was stunned. "Why do you want to do that?"</p>

  <p>In Emily's eyes, giving the Rebirth Land to others was thankless work.</p>

  <p>Giving out the Rebirth Land meant handing over the control of part of the world to someone else.</p>

  <p>"There is an extremely gifted talent in my inner world. I want to give him a Rebirth Land," Luo Zheng uttered honestly after thinking over it for a moment.</p>

  <p>He didn't have to hide anything else except the matter about No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"Talent? How talented is he? Is he more impressive than you?" Leopold asked smiling wryly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly, a modest grin on his face. "Perhaps in some aspects, this person really is more impressive than I am. I'm afraid that if I let him out, I won't be able to stop him in the future. Giving him the Rebirth Land can be considered a precaution to prevent the worst from arising."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Emily's and Leopold's interests were piqued.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shared a very close blood relationship with Chiyou. He was after all the talent born from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. Now Luo Zheng claimed that there was someone more incredible than him in his inner world. This was truly amazing.</p>

  <p>"In ten years, he has mastered 3, 000 Divine Dao. Does that make him outstanding?" Luo Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>Leopold blinked in shock and Emily's eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>According to the masters in the Source World, the 3, 000 Divine Dao were the definitions of the various kinds of energy existing within the chaos.</p>

  <p>According to different classification methods, the number of the Divine Dao varied. Even the large majority of the True Gods in the Source World only needed to master one or two in order to challenge the Sea of Truth and cross it.</p>

  <p>Only a minute amount of supernatural talents were qualified and capable of comprehending several Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Of course, some top masters in the Source World attempted to master 3, 000 Divine Dao, and Chiyou was one of them.</p>

  <p>"In ten years? Luo Zheng, you must be kidding?" Emily asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 didn't have much interest in the Divine Dao. Even if the Evil God's talent was astounding, it was not surprised at all. The only thing that shocked No. 9527 was that the Evil God even managed to merge the internal momentum of 2, 994 Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>As for Emily and Leopold, they were completely taken aback to learn that one would master so many Divine Dao. If one person comprehended 3, 000 Divine Dao alone in ten years, it was a shocking feat even in the Source World.</p>
