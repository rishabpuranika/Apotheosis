  <p>
</p>

  <p>Long ago, Mastema had tried to swallow Clarence.</p>

  <p>The attempt wasn't just undertaken once. He tried to swallow Clarence in the eleventh, ninth, and eighth grade worlds but failed every single time.</p>

  <p>However, Clarence had just given his abilities to a human, which proved to be the greatest opportunity that had ever come for Mastema.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of Clarence but being chased by him irritated him.</p>

  <p>Swallowing this troublesome guy's abilities would solve everything once and for all.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could prepare for the next round of counterattack, he found his body pierced through by leeches.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>The leeches were literally sucking away the ancestry-level bloodline in his body.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, leave him!" the ancestry-level bloodline told him.</p>

  <p>It had previously resisted splitting itself before it awakened so there was no way it was going to let the downgrader do the same thing.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied, immediately moving away from where he once stood using his omnipotent power.</p>

  <p>This teleportation method had a very high priority in the primitive land. It was so fast that it did not even cause any space fluctuations.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In just the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng found himself already on the other side of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>"Move away..."</p>

  <p>Astonishment was evident on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He had just moved tens of millions of miles but the downgrader was able to keep up with him. No leech dislodged itself from his body while the downgrader remained at his heels, keeping a certain distance.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and once again used his omnipotent power but the results remained the same. Wherever he went, the downgrader followed.</p>

  <p>"Resistance is futile," the downgrader told him with a maniacal laugh as the leeches continued to absorb Luo Zheng's ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>No matter where Luo Zheng went, he immediately followed so much so that it almost seemed as if the two of them had become one. The Extreme Form energy exerted by his constant movements practically covered the entirety of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not convinced and moved eight more times.</p>

  <p>The result was always the same and Luo Zheng soon realized that there was no way he was going to get rid of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"I'll cut you off!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted in irritation.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, a new moon appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>"One Token Slash!"</p>

  <p>This was a token he had obtained from Clarence's memories. He released an infinite amount of energy to maximize its power.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng summoned his strength, the new moon expanded from a few hundred miles to billions of miles long!</p>

  <p>This humongous moon was magnificent but only a few people could enjoy its majesty.</p>

  <p>Those in the Immortal Mansion had no idea of the ongoing fight between Luo Zheng and the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Li Shan mountain, the Ruin Graveyard, and the divine land were all but destroyed along with the families, friends, and clans that once lived there. Only a few dozen people were left alive in the chaos and an unprecedented sense of loneliness rose from the survivors' hearts.</p>

  <p>"Look at that moon!" Luo Nian burst in awe as he pointed up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"Is Luo Zheng making a move?" Luo Xiao asked, his voice tinged with concern.</p>

  <p>"It should be him. The battle's not over yet!" Yan exclaimed with hope.</p>

  <p>The entirety of the sky was covered by the new moon, which painted an incomparably shocking and beautiful scene.</p>

  <p>Whilst everyone looked at the moon, the Snake Goddess chose to ruminate in solitude.</p>

  <p>She stared at the direction of what was once Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Despite being forcefully taken away from the Source World, in the end, the Li Shan mountain was still destroyed.</p>

  <p>That was just how fate worked, it seemed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, an idea suddenly came to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>She felt like a struggling insect that, no matter how high she flew, could not escape the trap she had stumbled into.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The new moon slashed down, aimed at the leeches between the downgrader and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite its size, the new moon remained as thin as a blade.</p>

  <p>As it fell, it began to shrink as all the Extreme Form energies gathered and condensed into one thin line of unimaginable power.</p>

  <p>However, all the downgrader had to do was gently push forward at the direction of the new moon and an invisible enchanted barrier enveloped around them.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>This barrier inevitably collided with the thin blade of the new moon.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a sharp voice echoed within the void.</p>

  <p>There was no way infinite energy could offset infinite energy.</p>

  <p>The strongest spear could not break the strongest shield.</p>

  <p>It was the case in the Immortal Mansion before, and the same held true now.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>With that, several new moons once again floated in the air.</p>

  <p>These new moons surrounded Luo Zheng, slashing at the downgrader one after the other, to no avail.</p>

  <p>"Dispersing state!"</p>

  <p>In this seemingly hopeless situation, Luo Zheng chose to turn to his last resort: the disintegration of his body. As the owner of the primitive land, his ability was to disperse his body if ever he was killed. It was equivalent to suicide but it was a choice he had to make for the sake of everyone.</p>

  <p>However, at the moment of his body's collapse, an extremely strong binding force held him together. His body collapsed without dissipating!</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." the downgrader sneered.</p>

  <p>He was always one step ahead of Luo Zheng in this fight.</p>

  <p>They had the same abilities but the same could not be said when it came to strength.</p>

  <p>As the ancestry-level bloodline was completely absorbed by the leeches, Luo Zheng's body floated, empty and devoid of everything.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>With a single glance, the downgrader set Luo Zheng's body aflame and burned it until it was nothing but ashes.</p>

  <p>"Infinity plus infinity is still infinity.</p>

  <p>My strength has not increased but I saved so much trouble. It feels good."</p>

  <p>The downgrader's six pairs of compound eyes flashed green, indicating his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a slight buzzing noise, the downgrader's body disappeared and then materialized in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>His presence quickly threw everyone in deep despair.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Zheng would've allowed the downgrader to enter the Immortal Mansion unless he was dead. Thus, there was only one reason why the downgrader was here.</p>

  <p>"Where is my father?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian asked through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"He's dead. Your father has been absorbed by me. He is now a part of my own body," the downgrader replied.</p>

  <p>"You... You're lying!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian screamed as he ran to the downgrader at breakneck speed and threw a punch to his face.</p>

  <p>The force from Luo Nian's punch had the ability to reach tens of millions of miles. However, despite his strength, the downgrader remained unmoved and unbothered.</p>

  <p>But Luo Nian did not care.</p>

  <p>He was angry and he had to vent his anger so he continued to throw dozens of punches towards the intruder.</p>

  <p>Nobody dared stop him. Nobody, not even Tianming, Yan, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, or Li Luoshui, made a move.</p>

  <p>Their combined strength could not be compared to that of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>There was no need to fight a lost battle.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the fight, the downgrader finally made his move and caught Luo Nian's fist. With a slight twitch of his wrist, he was able to sever the young man's arm from his body. "I felt nothing. Your punches couldn't even tickle me. You're poorly weak."</p>

  <p>As he ridiculed Luo Nian, fist-sized marks of the darkest black began to appear over the surface of the downgrader's body.</p>

  <p>These ink marks expanded and created cracks upon the downgrader's skin, signaling his body's collapse!</p>
