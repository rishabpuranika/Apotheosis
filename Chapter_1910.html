<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In the exterior world of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Kaleidoscope race owned the Wind Exterminating Valley.</p>

  <p>Reaching high up into the sky, the tablets were standing in the Wind Exterminating Valley. Beneath the light, these said tablets had a beautiful, dazzling hue.</p>

  <p>On the tablets was a recording of Holy Jay's understanding on all kinds of laws. Here, he exhibited his comprehension concerning the laws in order to help the warriors who came here to better understand them.</p>

  <p>Among the six great cultivation sacred places, the Wind Exterminating Valley wasn't a popular one for cultivation.</p>

  <p>In other words, any warrior from the divine land showed no interest in particular for this place.</p>

  <p>Because these said warriors were actually qualified to practice the most orthodox of laws all throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>Any law in a universe was actually the Holy Being's comprehension over such in the divine land. They were created directly through the Holy Being's understanding. If anyone from the divine land wanted to practice the laws, there was no need for them to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They could just stay within the divine land instead.</p>

  <p>On the contrary though, warriors from the universes as well as the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were very interested in the Wind Exterminating Valley.</p>

  <p>Tianming had been sitting in front of a tablet for three days now.</p>

  <p>The tablet in front of him recorded the Thunder Law. The tablet had ten levels. If one took the time to observe the tablet, it was possible to observe very conspicuous level of law.</p>

  <p>The lowest one recorded the first layer of Thunder Law, where the Law Power was intense, however easy to understand.</p>

  <p>The higher the layer was, the more intense the Thunder Law was.</p>

  <p>Starting from the fourth level, a blue lightning appeared and intertwined continuously around the tablet. Every time a lightning bolt would strike, its streak of light would speedily climb upward, like a snake. The lightning grew stronger and stronger and the rapid and frequent color changes began to spread out.</p>

  <p>The azure blue color of the lightening changed into white, then black, over to purple and into cyan...</p>

  <p>These numerous, different colors were a representation of the Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>As the lightening reached the top of the tablet, it transformed into thunder, sounding out a violent rumble before disappearing completely.</p>

  <p>Tianming only had a limited amount of time.</p>

  <p>He searched for the Law Power he required in the Wind Exterminating Valley and made a record of such, all while reconstructing this same law within his own inner world. By doing so, he could master the Thunder Law completely.</p>

  <p>What was more, he had to go to visit Skyland race. Pristine Life Vitality was critical for him, too. Due to the limited time, he had to comprehend the law in tablet as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A bolt of lightning spread out across the whole tablet, from the bottom all the way to the top.</p>

  <p>However, once the bolt had spread out and turned into a rumble of thunder, the lightning failed to disappear. Instead, a faint flash circled in a downward spiral, shooting toward Tianming. The flash was so fast that it only impressed the people who stood directly next to it, with its dissipating glare. That was when it hit Tianming's body.</p>

  <p>"This boy..." someone began. "Really has an amazing comprehension ability!"</p>

  <p>"In just a few days, he has already mastered the laws in three tablets!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, every member of our Kaleidoscope race is born with a sensitivity to the Law Power and has received thirteen baptisms by laws.</p>

  <p>However, in comparison to him, our speed of understanding the law is far inferior to his."</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't pay any attention to these astonished comments and instead, held an expression of happiness on his lips.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, he was actually rather puzzled at the situation before him.</p>

  <p>Although he was very confident in his own talent, Tianming still couldn't believe that he was capable of comprehending the laws in such a short period of time. During his first few days upon entering the Kaleidoscope race, he had felt that the laws were so simple.</p>

  <p>In a single glance, he could easily solve the abstruse laws, like a simple math equation for a child.</p>

  <p>With this subtle feeling of comprehension accompanying him and increasing his confidence, Tianming's rate of mastering the Law Power was upgraded by no less than a hundred times.</p>

  <p>He thought carefully to himself, 'I didn't have much luck in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. How could there be such a miraculous change here?</p>

  <p>Perhaps my perception has increased?' Tianming was immersed in his own mind.</p>

  <p>That sliver of lightening had pierced into his cinnabar field and absorbed the life vitality within his inner world immediately. On such a bare continent, a tiny tablet of the sort was completely condensed.</p>

  <p>And Tianming wasn't new to this kind of tablet, in fact, he had probably received over thirty of them. Among them, each tablet stood for a layer of a law. If he could completely comprehend the law within the Thunder Law tablet in front of him, Tianming would create a total of ten tablets in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Forging the Law Tablet was actually a very common way for one to practice and cultivate.</p>

  <p>Once he had successfully forged this tiny tablet within his inner world, Tianming didn't move at all. Instead, he sat there, very still and quietly, in an attempt to comprehend the Thunder Law. He had just acquired a profound meaning of the seventh layer of Thunder Law. His next goal was to break through to the eighth layer!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a few warriors from the Kaleidoscope race rushed toward Tianming, confidently led by Carney, the leader of Kaleidoscope race.</p>

  <p>Carney, as well as several others from Kaleidoscope race, walked over to Tianming. Tianming continued to comprehend the tablet before him and paid no attention to people heading his way. It seemed as though he hadn't seen them at all.</p>

  <p>The other warriors were curious as to why this race leader had come over and if it was the boy's astonishing talent that had attracted Carney's attention.</p>

  <p>Nathan, standing a hundred meters from Tianming at the time, pursed his lips together upon seeing this.</p>

  <p>After selecting the Wind Exterminating Valley as their cultivation sacred place, both Tianming and Nathan wanted to comprehend the laws before they started cultivating in the Skyland race. Tianming really gave him a blow after they had entered the Wind Exterminating Valley.</p>

  <p>What Nathan cultivated was Truth Godly Way, which was the root of enacting laws. Nathan was more sensitive to laws than any other geniuses.</p>

  <p>Nathan was half a month earlier to enter the Wind Exterminating Valley than Tianming was. In those fifteen short days, his comprehension over the laws was so astonishing that the people from the Wind Exterminating Valley began to look at him differently. Other races were quick to join the amazement.</p>

  <p>Originally, Nathan felt good about the idea and thought he was making the right decision to enter the Wind Exterminating Valley.</p>

  <p>It was simple. The laws were one of the fundamental elements. The more profound one's law comprehension was, the stronger the effects of life vitality would be.</p>

  <p>However, only 2 weeks later, Tianming arrived…</p>

  <p>Tianming was the first acquaintance that Nathan had met in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The two of them didn't have any conflicts with one another in the past, however, due to Nathan's personality, the two of them only exchanged small talk.</p>

  <p>Tianming's following performance left Nathan completely dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>Within a single day, he had completely comprehended a Fire Law tablet.</p>

  <p>On the second day, he had switched over to an Ice Law tablet, which he understood at the same speed as the first. On the third day, he comprehended…</p>

  <p>There was no way he was going to be able to do it that fast! Nathan felt nothing but astonishment at Tianming's speed. Comprehending this profound and mysterious tablet in front of Tianming was as simple as eating and drinking to him.</p>

  <p>Now, as he watched the Kaleidoscope race leader reach Tianming personally, Nathan could do nothing but sigh silently.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Hua Tianming?" Carney asked.</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't reply. He did raise his head though, his gaze fixated on the massive tablet.</p>

  <p>"Our leader is asking you a question." A Kaleidoscope race member couldn't help but berate.</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt him," Carney said, as he demonstrated extreme patience, stopping his clansman from egging forward. Then, Carney stood to the side and waited, all while hinting at his clansmen not to make a ruckus.</p>

  <p>Although Tianming's eyes were wide open, it seemed more as though he had entered a meditative state. His two eyes stared blankly at the tablet without any motion.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Another bolt of lightning rose from the bottom, shooting up into the sky and spreading into a glowing net.</p>

  <p>Buzz…</p>

  <p>A thin streak of lightning once again appeared from within the thunderstorm. It was released from the top of the tablet and drilled into Tianming's cinnabar field. Once again, it transformed into a small tablet within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Only then did Tianming slowly turn his head. With a smile on his face, he looked at Carney and said, "Sorry, just now, I …"</p>

  <p>"You were completely immersed in studying the law and I should be happy about that. How can you say you're sorry?" Carney smiled slightly and said, "However, the prophet from our race has personally invited you, which might delay your learning for a short while."</p>

  <p>"Prophet?" Tianming frowned, but soon after, he relaxed. He didn't have many concerns and said, "OK."</p>

  <p>What he knew was already more than what Zheng did. There were many things that didn't require explanation, and he could guess at a rough idea.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Tianming," said Carney, as he headed towards the depths of Wind Exterminating Valley. Together, they followed a long, winding tunnel deep into the valley.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a tent appeared at the end of the tunnel. Naturally, the old man sitting in the tent was the Kaleidoscope race's prophet.</p>
