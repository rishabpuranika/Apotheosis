<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eddie's face darkened, the killing intent in his heart growing even stronger.</p>

  <p>The Fiery Star Flame didn't kill Luo Zheng. He was really tough!</p>

  <p>If he had the chance to kill Luo Zheng in the celestial tomb, he would have done it without any hesitation. Eddie was extremely careful. He wouldn't wait until Luo Zheng became really strong to challenge him.</p>

  <p>If he didn't have the chance to kill Luo Zheng in the celestial tomb, Eddie would have to come up with another way to break the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array. Either way, he would not spare Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>The beam of light continued spinning rapidly. After Zheng's round was over, it landed on the short man— the Poison King Simon.</p>

  <p>This time, Simon got the number four. But the fourth disk was red!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, many people secretly let out a sigh of relief. Simon had held a deep enmity with the warriors of the Central Region. If he were left alive, it would be a disaster. However, he was a Life and Death Realm master, so it still remained to be seen whether he could get through this time.</p>

  <p>Everyone assumed that the red disk meant that it was some kind of a punishment for Simon. However, when he stepped on it, a voice suddenly rang in everyone's ears, "Free challenge."</p>

  <p>"What?" "Free challenge?"</p>

  <p>"So does that mean Simon can challenge whoever he wants?"</p>

  <p>"This is worrying. There are too many people who have offended him back then in the Central Region."</p>

  <p>Many warriors' faces fell. They had thought that Simon would be punished, but instead he was being given the right to challenge anyone he wanted.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance looked calm. He did not seem to be worried about Simon choosing him. But the three fat leaders of the World Commercial Alliance didn't look good. With the three of them working together, they could take on a Life and Death Realm warrior. But if they fought alone, none would be able to defeat Simon.</p>

  <p>Simon chuckled and spoke menacingly, "Free challenge, who shall I choose?" His gaze swept past Imogen, Ning Yudie, and the rest without a pause.</p>

  <p>However, when his eyes met Eddie's, he paused for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Eddie sneered and said, "You dare challenge me?"</p>

  <p>"I will take your life sooner or later, but not now," came Simon's retort. His gaze swept over the people from the divine kingdom and fell upon the Bloodwood Cliff. Lady Poison-blood's face was drained of color when she noticed that Simon was staring at her, as if what she faced was a formidable foe.</p>

  <p>Simon sneered, "Lady Poison-blood, what are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"No, nothing..." Lady Poison-blood strived to appear calm as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"You're afraid that I'll challenge you, aren't you?" Simon asked.</p>

  <p>"You are a Life and Death Realm master while I am only in the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Of course, I wouldn't want to fight you," Lady Poison-blood said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"No, that's not the only thing you're afraid of," Simon said.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood suddenly shook her head. "I, I don't understand what you're talking about…"</p>

  <p>"Back then, I was being hunted down by the several sects because I had the Scripture of Five Poisons. The world of warriors is a cruel one, I can understand that, but… Whether it is the Ethereal Spirit Sect, Cloud Hall, or the World Commercial Alliance, they only targeted me but not my family. I wonder if Lady Poison-blood has ever heard the saying, 'Never take revenge on somebody's family.' All two thousand members of my family, from the old to the young, all of them were killed by you, Bloodwood Cliff!" Simon said coldly, "It is time to settle the score!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Simon finished speaking, Lady Poison-blood's face turned pale!</p>

  <p>Everyone let out a gasp when they heard this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng agreed with what Simon had said. Never take revenge on someone's family. It was best not to involve the family members no matter how great the hatred between the warriors. Otherwise, the war would never cease until the one responsible paid with his life.</p>

  <p>If it was Luo Zheng who had suffered this, he wouldn't let it go either.</p>

  <p>Once Simon chose to challenge Lady Poison-blood, a circular platform appeared in the air above the abyss. Lady Poison-blood and Simon stepped onto the platform.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's usually coquettish face was now white as a sheet!</p>

  <p>"Lady Poison-blood, in the Dreamy Swampland, I have waited for this day for many years. In fact, I should have settled this a long time ago," announced Simon. As he spoke, colorful life vitality began to flow out of his body. He was known as the Poison King, so even his life vitality was extremely poisonous.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's expression turned vicious. At this moment, she had no choice but to go all out to fight Simon.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Blood-clotting Waves!"</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood yelled as she started the first attack. Blood mist gushed towards Simon like the waves of the ocean.</p>

  <p>Facing Lady Poison-blood's billowing blood mist, Simon sneered. "Lady Poison-blood, after all these years, your cultivation level has risen from the preliminary stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm to the late stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm. Unfortunately, your strength has not increased much!"</p>

  <p>With that, Simon thrust his hand forward and five-colored smoke gushed out from his palm. The smoke was formed by five bright colors. It looked extremely beautiful. This meant that the more beautiful it was, the more poisonous it was!</p>

  <p>How could Lady Poison-blood not know this? She quickly stirred the blood mist to block the five-colored smoke.</p>

  <p>"Hah! You are too weak."</p>

  <p>Everyone heard Simon sigh softly. In a flash, he moved behind Lady Poison-blood. A leaf was visible in his hand.</p>

  <p>The leaf was not green. It was transparent, and the textures on it were like the blood vessels of a human body. There was a trace of blood on the edge of the leaf.</p>

  <p>Blood was also trickling down Lady Poison-blood's neck.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie shook her head, "Lady Poison-blood is dead."</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the crowd saw Lady Poison-blood reach out to touch her neck. However, just as she covered her neck, her snow-white skin gradually turned black. Her gorgeous body, which had many men spellbound before, began to emit white smoke.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>All the warriors present had been in numerous bloody fights, but most of them still felt bad when they saw Lady Poison-blood's miserable death.</p>

  <p>Soon, Lady Poison-blood's body was completely corroded by the poison, leaving behind only a pile of bones scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>Simon bent down and picked up Lady Poison-blood's space ring and stuffed it into his own pocket. A sneer spread across his face before he leaped back to where he stood before.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's space ring held the Bloodwood Token of Bloodwood Cliff as well as their sect leader's token and other inheritance of the Bloodwood Cliff. But the elders of Bloodwood Cliff didn't dare ask the Poison King Simon to return these important items to them.</p>

  <p>With Simon setting a precedent to take the free challenge, everyone immediately became vigilant.</p>

  <p>Initially, everyone thought that this was just a game, a test of luck. And the warriors present would pose no threat to each other. But after Simon's round, they knew that as long as one got the 'free challenge', the person could pick a fight with anyone. Of course, this was under the assumption that the person was strong enough to beat the one he chose.</p>

  <p>After Simon, it was Yudie's turn to throw the dice.</p>

  <p>"Six!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie smiled and took six steps forward. On the sixth disk, a halo of yellow light shone brightly.</p>

  <p>"Throw it again!"</p>

  <p>"Six!"</p>

  <p>"Throw it again!"</p>

  <p>"Six!"</p>

  <p>"Again..."</p>

  <p>This scene left everyone speechless. Their eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>It was incredible that Ning Yudie had such a good luck!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie took 60 steps all together, including the previous 12 steps she got from last rounds!</p>

  <p>Standing on the transparent disk, Ning Yudie was very close to the center of the abyss. Everyone else was almost at the beginning of their journey. Luo Zheng probably felt the most depressed because he had only managed to take three steps away from the platform.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie was already far ahead of them. Standing alone in the middle of the abyss, she became the center of attention!</p>

  <p>"Yudie's luck is really great!"</p>

  <p>"Don't joke. She is the chosen one of the Cloud Hall. I heard that Ning Yudie comes from a common family without any strong background. She has managed to become one of the strongest women in the Central Region despite having such a low identity. How many can match her luck?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! 60 steps! It seems like the game will end in 100 steps. If Ning Yudie were to throw a few more rounds, she would probably pass the test, right?"</p>

  <p>As the crowd discussed among themselves, the face of the Holy Maiden from the divine kingdom, had already completely darkened.</p>

  <p>Women were sensitive creatures, and they liked to be the focus of everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Prior to Yudie's round, she had been the front runner. She did not expect another woman, merely an ant in her eyes, to have such a good luck. She was the Holy Maiden of a prominent clan. How could she be defeated by an ant?</p>

  <p>A malicious light flashed in her eyes, and exactly at that moment, the beam of light from the dice stopped on her.</p>
