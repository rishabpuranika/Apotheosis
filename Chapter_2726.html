<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2726 Find Out The Truth </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this time, the Han Clan began to dissolve the Purple Soul Hall because of Joy's disappearance.</p>

  <p>In order to prove his innocence to Nicholas, Samuel drove everyone from the Purple Soul Hall out of the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The children of the Han Clan, especially Liusu, quarreled with Samuel over it and tried their best to stop it, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Soon after that, Samuel requested Pascal, Aleyna, and Liusu to cultivate in seclusion. The two girls were initially resistant to this but eventually agreed.</p>

  <p>But right before they left, Samuel said something puzzling; he stated that during their cultivation, he would help them reach the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Reaching the consummation of True God Realm was not something that could be decided or learned, even by the members of powerful clans on Floating Islands. It had to be decided by fate.</p>

  <p>Even the Dongfang Clan would not dare to say that they could cultivate three consummate True Gods through a short-term closed-door cultivation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, at that time, Aleyna was only a proving godly warrior and Liusu was only a low-rank True God. It was impossible to even think that they could reach the consummation of True God Realm in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the three of them started cultivating in seclusion, and everything went fine for the first few days...until something strange happened.</p>

  <p>The last scene in Liusu's memory was the sight of Samuel appearing in front of her and reaching out his hand toward her forehead.</p>

  <p>Before she could scream, her memory came to an abrupt end.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the Memory Flame that danced gently in his hand with a complicated expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>It seemed that to some extent, Liusu was dead.</p>

  <p>As long as someone was alive, their Memory Flame would constantly be updated.</p>

  <p>With every second that passed in the Divine Land, a memory would be accumulated in one's Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether a moment revolved around pain, despair, boring cultivation, or an important event in one's life, like weddings or funerals, it would all be added to the Memory Flame in real time.</p>

  <p>So in the Reincarnation Land, when no new memories were added to a Memory Flame, it could be said that the owner of that Memory Flame was dead. By this logic, Liusu, Aleyna, and Pascal were all dead as their Memory Flames hadn't been updated for a long time.</p>

  <p>'I wonder what's going on with Liusu and the other two now, ' Luo Zheng wondered with a frown.</p>

  <p>Since Liusu's Memory Flame had stopped updating, he could not find out what had happened to her.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a name popped into Luo Zheng's mind. "Kelsey! She has a good relationship with Aleyna and Liusu. She must know what happened to them!"</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Zheng continued to search the sea of Memory Flames and soon spotted Kelsey's Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his finger, the light pink Memory Flame shot toward him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately grabbed hold of it and started to view Kelsey's memories.</p>

  <p>He skipped the parts about Kelsey's childhood and directly went to her memories of the last few years.</p>

  <p>He had thought he would be able to find out some important information from Kelsey, but he was left disappointed.</p>

  <p>Kelsey had also been in seclusion for the past few years and hadn't come out yet.</p>

  <p>It seemed that she had more likely been put under house arrest than sent to cultivate in seclusion. She didn't know what had happened to her two sisters at all.</p>

  <p>Standing at the top of the stairs, Luo Zheng looked at the boundless sea of Memory Flames as he paced back and forth.</p>

  <p>Samuel had hidden his Memory Flame, and Pascal ended similar like Liusu. Then, who else in the Han Clan could help Luo Zheng find out the truth?</p>

  <p>At this moment, several extremely bright dots flashed in the distance in the sea of Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Most of the light spots in this sea of 77 million quadrillion Memory Flames were very dim.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames of those who had become True Gods were slightly bright. The Memory Flames of those who had reached the consummation of True God Realm were glowing, while the Memory Flames of the Holy Beings dazzled like stars.</p>

  <p>It was not that the brightness of a Memory Flame was decided by one's cultivation; it was decided by the length of one's lifetime and the richness of their memories.</p>

  <p>The people that had the longest lives might not necessarily be Holy Beings, but in general, Holy Beings had a long lifespan.</p>

  <p>So, the Memory Flames that emitted the brightest lights mostly belonged to Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know whether Nicholas knew any information regarding Liusu's situation, he could find some information about his mother and even about the recent actions of the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. This was an opportunity he couldn't miss.</p>

  <p>Without any further ado, Luo Zheng carefully searched the sea of Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Soon, a dazzling golden Memory Flame started to move in the sea of Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>'This is Nicholas's Memory Flame!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the golden light dot and began to view the memories in it...</p>

  <p>It turned out that even before Nicholas was born, the Dongfang Clan was already a very powerful clan.</p>

  <p>So, Nicholas faced great competition in the Dongfang Clan, but relying on his solid foundation, he made great contributions to his clan...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng naturally wanted to learn each and every single detail about his opponent, but there was just too much information to absorb.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had so many divine eras' worth of memories in his Memory Flame that it was impossible for Luo Zheng to look at all of them in detail. He quickly fast-forwarded to the part of the Memory Flame which contained memories from the recent decades. What he was most concerned about was the news about his mother.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng saw the memories about his journey to the Silverwing Divine City.</p>

  <p>"A powerful master at the Other Shore Realm, Master Hamish! Is this man a Yellow Emperor Guard?"</p>

  <p>This was the first time Luo Zheng had seen a Yellow Emperor Guard in the Divine Land. He hadn't expected a powerful master at the Other Shore Realm to assort medicinal materials in the Silverwing Divine City!</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Zheng saw Nicholas leading the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans deep underground to search for Lorena.</p>

  <p>By the time that had happened, Luo Zheng had already been thrown out of the Divine Land by Lorena and had fallen toward the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, my mother was taken away by Nicholas!"</p>

  <p>Hatred filled Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Just when he had finally been reunited with his mother and started to believe that everything was going to change for the better, Nicholas and Hamish had ruined everything!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to watch Nicholas's memories, he was surprised by what he saw.</p>

  <p>Nicholas built a delicate palace for his mother and protected her carefully.</p>

  <p>In front of his mother, this man was no longer the overbearing Holy Being that he usually was. He even promised to her that he would find her a body in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>'It seems that my mother is not in danger for the time being, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself in relief.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng got a general idea of what was happening next with Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Then, after learning about Luo Zheng's return, Nicholas decided to go with Murphy to the Murphy Universe to test Emily, Timotheus, and others.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Nicholas was already feeling a sense of crisis. He summoned the leaders of the alliance of the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands to Goldenrain Hall for a meeting.</p>

  <p>From Nicholas's Memory Flame, Luo Zheng was able to learn what had happened in Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>In Goldenrain Hall, he finally saw Liusu, Aleyna, and Pascal, who had returned from their cultivation in seclusion.</p>

  <p>They had really reached the consummation of True God Realm as Samuel had told them they would.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's heart ached when he saw Liusu.</p>

  <p>She was no longer the Liusu that he knew.</p>

  <p>The bodies of Samuel's three children seemed to have become containers that held other people's Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had discovered that by absorbing the memories in a person's Memory Flame, one could obtain a massive amount of cultivation experience in a minimal time and improve their cultivation level at an unimaginable speed.</p>

  <p>However, for Luo Zheng, that had purely been a hypothesis. He had never imagined that someone would actually do it!</p>

  <p>'Samuel... In order to avenge himself, he has done everything he can, and he has even sacrificed his own children!' Luo Zheng sighed.</p>
