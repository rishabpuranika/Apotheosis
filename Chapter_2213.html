<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ferryman's words alleviated Mae's anger.</p>

  <p>With a light flick of her hand, she threw two divine might coins toward the ferryman.</p>

  <p>But instead of taking the two divine might coins, the ferryman just waved his hand lightly and sent them flying back to Mae. He shook his head and said, "You have already paid the price. We won't charge you twice."</p>

  <p>Then, the ferryman suddenly stood up and turned his face to the Time Sea with his eyes still closed. He moved his lips, but no sound left his mouth. No one knew what he was saying.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind members had a special ability.</p>

  <p>No matter where one was in the Time Sea, as long as they stood on the shore, they didn't need to send any messages or inform anyone, and the Sun Blind members would come to them as soon as possible without wasting any time.</p>

  <p>In the remote ages, the Hall of Holy Beings hadn't been established and there were no Floating Islands in the Time Sea. At that time, if a True God wanted to explore the Time Sea, they only needed to bring a few divine might coins with them. After the Sun Blind members reached the shore, they would ask if the True God wanted to explore the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Later, the Hall of Holy Beings was established and the Time Sea became occupied by the wealthy clans. The Hall of Holy Beings and the leader of the Sun Blind race reached an agreement. Other than the members of the wealthy clans, the Sun Blind members usually wouldn't ferry a True God who didn't belong to these wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>That was why after Mae and Luo Zheng stayed at the shore for a while, a Sun Blind member came with a boat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Mae waited in the boat for a long time.</p>

  <p>Finally, two small black dots appeared on the surface of the colorful sea.</p>

  <p>Two boats were approaching them rapidly, one after the other.</p>

  <p>The boat in the front was controlled by a burly man, while the boat in the back was being steered by a stooping old man. Apparently, these two men were the ferryman's brother and father respectively.</p>

  <p>The two men slowly drew the boats and came closer. Once the three Sun Blind members converged, they talked to one another in secret for a while without making so much as a sound. The only sign that they were even communicating was the slight trembling of their lips. Luo Zheng and Mae had no idea what they were talking about.</p>

  <p>After this secret exchange, the old man said to Luo Zheng, "Get in my boat and I'll take you there."</p>

  <p>Seeing that the old man had agreed to ferry Luo Zheng, Mae let out a sigh of relief. She nodded at Luo Zheng and said, "Go ahead. See you on the Floating Island."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leapt up and landed firmly in the old man's boat.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng was seated, the old man set down the two huge bone oars he had been holding and gently swung his arms to row the boat. This boat was like a flood dragon that dove into the water, closing toward the colorful sea.</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>The pair of bone oars made a piercing sound, sending waves rolling on both sides of the boat. A few waves leapt up in the air, releasing a strong power of Time Law.</p>

  <p>The Time Law was not condensed by life vitality. It was the real time and history of the divine land. For example, although Luo Zheng had only come on board the Sun Blind member's boat an hour ago, that event had already become a historical record in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, the Time Sea had recorded everything that had happened since the divine land was born, but all of that information had turned into time fragments and joined the Time Sea. It was almost impossible to accurately find a period in such a vast sea as it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>As the boat drifted farther and farther away, it sped up.</p>

  <p>It was not until then that Luo Zheng noticed the cyan light that had begun to emit from the old man's bone oars. Every time he rowed the boat, the cyan light would spread out and circle the bottom of the boat. It was this cyan light that allowed the boat to travel in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race had been in the Time Sea for so many years that it was no surprise that they had their own secrets. Otherwise, why would the wealthy clans here rely on the Sun Blind members to ferry them?</p>

  <p>The old man kept his head low in an attempt to avoid communication with Luo Zheng, but Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask, "Just now, your son said that he didn't want to ferry me because he was afraid of me. Why did he say that?"</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>As the waves flowed, the old man continued to row the boat with his sturdy arms, spreading cyan light into the sea. After a long silence, he opened his mouth and said, "The Time Sea is a sea of death for people like you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. "I've heard that any creature that falls into the Time Sea will be torn into pieces by the Time Law, and then travel to different times."</p>

  <p>The old man of the Sun Blind race chuckled as he rowed the boat. He then said, "That's true for people like you. Even the best of the True Gods would die if they were to fall into the Time Sea. But that's not the case for the creatures living in this sea."</p>

  <p>"Living in this sea? You mean there are other creatures in the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face lit up with surprise.</p>

  <p>"If not, how did you think the Sun Blind race conquered this sea area?</p>

  <p>Where did this boat and this pair of bone oars come from?" the old man asked in reply.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng had asked Master Evil about this before, but Master Evil had only told him that the Sun Blind race had their own way of traveling in the sea, and Luo Zheng hadn't thought much about it after that.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng was immediately enlightened by the old man's words.</p>

  <p>"You mean the boat and the bone oars came from the creatures in the Time Sea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the old man answered with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>The bone oars were made from the spine of the Ghost Swimming Fish.</p>

  <p>After the Sun Blind warriors caught the Ghost Swimming Fish using a special method they had developed, they would peel the whole fish alive and extract the spine to refine it through the method passed on to them from their ancestors. It was from using this method that they obtained this special pair of bone oars.</p>

  <p>As for the boat they were using, it was covered with the skin of the Magic Dragon Fish, which allowed the boat to travel freely in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Both the Ghost Swimming Fish and the Magic Dragon Fish were creatures that lived in the Time Sea. Owing to their many years of evolution, these creatures were free to roam through time without fear of the tearing power of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that the Time Sea is not a dead sea," Luo Zheng muttered as his eyes flashed. The evolution of nature was indeed miraculous. He then asked, "But what does it have to do with your son being afraid of me?"</p>

  <p>The old man paused for a moment before answering, "There are many unknown powerful creatures in the Time Sea; the strongest one is called the Emperor Resentment. You have a peculiar Mu Ning that is very similar to that of the Emperor Resentment."</p>

  <p>Rowing in the Time Sea was not a smooth journey for the Sun Blind race. Although the Time Sea looked beautiful and quiet on the surface, there were many dangers lurking underneath. The Sun Blind members could die if they were not careful enough, which was why there were many taboos and rules in their clan.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, as long as they followed the rules, it was very safe to travel in the Time Sea. However, there was one risk that could not be avoided: encountering a sea monster— the Emperor Resentment.</p>

  <p>The legends of the Emperor Resentment existed not only in the Sun Blind race, but also in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the Emperor Resentment was too mysterious. No one had seen its complete form so far. If the sea monster truly began hunting in the Time Sea, there was no possibility of any warrior inferior to a Holy Being making it out alive.</p>

  <p>Once, in the middle ages, an Emperor Resentment had dragged a Holy Being into the Time Sea, intending to kill him. However, as long as the universe created by a Holy Being existed, the Holy Being would be immortal and their body would not be destroyed. As such, the Holy Being finally escaped from the Time Sea after years of entanglement with the Emperor Resentment. Although the Holy Being hadn't been taken down by the Emperor Resentment, he had still been very embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Some people listed the Emperor Resentment as a true spirit, but most agreed that the strength of the Emperor Resentment was far beyond the strength of an ordinary true spirit, because even a Holy Being could not do anything to it.</p>

  <p>"I have an Mu Ning similar to that of the Emperor Resentment?" The old man's answer had only increased Zheng's puzzlement. Luo Zheng hadn't been aware that he had such a peculiar Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the old man said. "My son is young, and hasn't seen the Emperor Resentment. But I saw the Emperor Resentment in the last divine era.</p>

  <p>Well, technically, I saw its hand."</p>

  <p>His face was full of fear and sadness, as if talking about it reminded him of a sad memory.</p>

  <p>It was said that the appearance of an Emperor Resentment would bring about a devastating disaster. It would not be unreasonable to think that the Emperor Resentment had caused a heavy blow to the old man. Even though a divine era had passed since the last time he had seen one, he became immersed in sorrow as soon as he thought about it.</p>
