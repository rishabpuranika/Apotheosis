<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2336 The Soul-killing Ghosts </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng never intended to join the discussion regarding the ownership of the broken arm.</p>

  <p>He didn't really have much to rely on in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The fusion of several hundred kinds of internal momentum was way too violent and he still couldn't control it.</p>

  <p>His Emotion Closing Godly Way had been greatly improved by his cultivation base but he really couldn't use it since it was a forbidden way.</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways and the theurgies beyond the Godly Ways he got from the powerful clans above the Time Sea through the Infinity Ruler were alright.</p>

  <p>However, the greatest thing Zheng relied on was the unbelievable amount of strength source within his body.</p>

  <p>His top priority right now was to refill the nine stars in his inner world as fast as possible so that he would be ready by the time the next wave of vicious beasts arrived.</p>

  <p>The nine stars slowly rotated within his body, exerting a huge gravitation force that continuously drew the chaotic energy into them. His strength source was now filled at around 15%.</p>

  <p>Reginald announcing that this arm belonged to him came as a bit of a surprise for Zheng.</p>

  <p>What Reginald said was indeed reasonable. Zheng cut the arm so it was perfectly justifiable for him to claim it. It resolved the dispute and even earned Zheng a really rare and useful item.</p>

  <p>Nobody would be willing to hand over such a precious thing to Zheng under normal circumstances. Whoever cut it off was irrelevant in the dispute given how everyone wanted a piece of this arm. The strongest warrior could very well take it for his own benefit.</p>

  <p>However, to bring an end to this messy dispute and ease the tension among the top-rank True Gods, Zheng being the arm's rightful owner only seemed to be right.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea, Reginald. I also think the arm should go to Tianxing,"</p>

  <p>Soren agreed with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That's right. The arm was cut off by him anyway," Nelly said on behalf of her clan.</p>

  <p>Bevan also agreed with this.</p>

  <p>Several top-rank True Gods also voiced out their agreement. If anyone else was dissatisfied, they didn't make it known.</p>

  <p>"Since everyone agrees, then I won't refuse," Zheng said, reaching out his hand in order to put the 10-foot-long arm into his space ring.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a mid-rank True God of the Fang Clan stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, hold on."</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to the fellow. The other True Gods frowned. A consensus had already been reached, so what was this fellow doing? This was simply too embarrassing.</p>

  <p>Soren also frowned. He regarded Zheng as a member of his clan.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to burst in anger, the mid-rank True God realized that everyone was looking at him in fury. He quickly raised his hands in an effort to quell the crowd's anger. "Everyone, you've misunderstood.</p>

  <p>As you all know, my clan is famous for making pills. This broken arm is really something that my clan can potentially reap a lot of benefits from.</p>

  <p>Tianxing, can you sell it to me? You can name the price."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and put the broken arm into his space ring. "If you want to trade, we should probably wait until we return to the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid this place isn't such a suitable venue for a deal."</p>

  <p>He didn't really know much about the uses of the Abyss Demon's broken arm so he wasn't really willing to sell it so casually. Besides, he wasn't lacking in divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"You're right," the mid-rank True God said, bowing and retreating to the side.</p>

  <p>The fourth wave of beasts killed eight True Gods; six were low-rank while two were mid-rank.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods quickly flew into the air the moment the Abyss Demons activated the Promise of Absolute Beginning, so all of them were safe. Everyone suffered in trying to kill the Abyss Demons so they now sat down and recuperated their strength around the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also sitting down and resting.</p>

  <p>After the fourth wave, the forbidden land provided them with the necessary amount of time to gather their strength. However, after about fifteen minutes, tremors once again came from the valley entrances.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood up in attention. They all looked at the direction of the tremors with vigilance.</p>

  <p>Eight True Gods had died earlier and the following waves would no doubt be even fiercer. Any carelessness on their part could result in death.</p>

  <p>It was true that they had obtained three Promises of Absolute Beginning which they could use to survive; however, they still needed to be smart.</p>

  <p>There might truly be supreme treasures of belief that waited for them later on.</p>

  <p>The warriors craned their necks and saw lights flickering in the distance.</p>

  <p>They waited for a long time but couldn't find any sign of any beasts.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at each other in dismay. Where were the monsters?</p>

  <p>A gust of cold air blew on Reginald's face. His expression immediately changed. "The monsters are good at hiding themselves! Everyone, use your spiritual sense!" As soon as he finished speaking, he spread out his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>He drew the outline for the world around him and soon found a group of low shadows crawling at an extremely fast rate. The closest was already in front of him.</p>

  <p>The shadow immediately sprang up and swung a sharp hook at Reginald's head.</p>

  <p>"Watch out! The Soul-killing Ghosts are coming!" Reginald roared. He quickly retreated backwards, barely avoiding the monster's attack.</p>

  <p>The sharp hook slid across his head but did not really cause him any major, physical harm. A chill then began to flow through his brain and made his face turn pale.</p>

  <p>As a soul creature, the Soul-killing Ghost's hook did not harm people but it could drag out the souls out of their brains.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Retreat quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Why didn't we notice them?"</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The scream came from a mid-rank True God whose eyes rolled up to the back of his head.</p>

  <p>His soul had been dragged out of his brain by the invisible hook.</p>

  <p>With his soul out of his body, the Soul-killing Ghosts immediately erupted into a frenzy. They surrounded the soul and slashed their hooks, tearing it apart. In the blink of an eye, the soul no longer existed. It had been swallowed up by the terrifying creatures.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God stood motionless in his place. Without his soul, he was now merely a walking corpse.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one. Despite Reginald's warning, the group already found themselves surrounded by the ghosts.</p>

  <p>The targets of each wave of beasts differed. The Dark Crows, for example, targeted the Goddess Statue first, while the others, such as the Abyss Demons, aimed for the True Gods themselves.</p>

  <p>These Soul-killing Ghosts were obviously going for the souls of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Everything was a blur. In an instant, seven to eight True Gods trembled and spasmed as their souls were dragged out and devoured by the monsters.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the other members of the Han Clan were not in the outermost circle, but the sight of their comrades having their souls sucked out of their bodies made a few of them tremble. Under Zheng's lead, the Han Clan chose to retreat immediately.</p>

  <p>As he released his spiritual sense, Zheng's eyes flashed with a faint green light.</p>

  <p>Others could only see faint shadows but with Zheng's magic vision, everything was just a bit clearer.</p>

  <p>He looked into the distance and saw a few cloaked dwarves crawling on the ground. They moved at an extremely fast rate and held thin hooks that were used in taking souls.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, two Soul-killing Ghosts suddenly jumped up and threw their hooks at him.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he snorted.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum flashed on his arm and shot out two bolts of blue lightning.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>The lightning shot the two Soul-killing Ghosts and hit them square on the chest.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>These Soul-killing Ghosts were without flesh and blood and couldn't resist the power of lightning. As Zheng's attack hit them, everyone heard mice-like squeaks before the two monsters vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Who cultivates the Thunderstorm Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"Other thunder methods will also work!"</p>

  <p>"Bombard them all to death!"</p>

  <p>These creatures disgusted the True Gods. Just thinking about their souls getting devoured sent a chill down their spine.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Numerous True Gods who cultivated the Thunderstorm Godly Way had begun to display their most powerful methods one after another.</p>
