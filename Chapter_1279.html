<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Immortal Book heard Luo Zheng's words, he chuckled.</p>

  <p>Bewildered, Luo Luo Zheng asked. "What are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>Saul, who was staying beside Luo Luo Zheng, looked impatient and grunted, "This old man has read too many books and likes to put on an act like this."</p>

  <p>Immortal Book just snorted at Saul and was not even bothered to quibble with him at all, but he quickly disclosed, "There is no good or bad cultivation methods in the world. And that Transcendent Divine Might you're referring to must be related to the Law of Causality. That kind of cultivation methods are extremely rare, but yes, we do have some."</p>

  <p>Taking in all the information Immortal Book had revealed, Luo Luo Zheng then queried the cyan dragon in his mind, "Is all Transcendent Divine Might related to the Law of Causality?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only realized that the Law of Causality was so powerful soon after he took hold of Black Star. At that time, Luo Luo Zheng was still practicing the Stellar Body. But until now, he hadn't finished the first half part of it yet.</p>

  <p>So he had no understanding as to whether the Stellar Body had some kind of correlation with the Law of Causality or not.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng entered the Immortal Mansion, the cyan dragon was also extremely astonished by the diversity of things inside. He merely maintained his silence, but he snapped out of his musing when Luo Luo Zheng threw him a question. He then commented, "Yes, you can say so. The Law of Causality is contained in the large majority of Transcendent Divine Might. However, I only obtained the first half part of the Stellar Body, and the Law of Causality might be hidden in the second half part."</p>

  <p>"I see..." Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book took a glance at Saul and seemed to be annoyed by the way how he described him. He then spoke amiably to Luo Luo Zheng, "I know you want to choose a cultivation method suitable for yourself, but there are simply too many cultivation methods here. However, since the owner of this Immortal Mansion has constructed such a large library, which is for the benefit of the later generations, he has told me the method of determining and selecting the suitable cultivation method for each warrior." With these words, he led Luo Luo Zheng and the others to show the different row of shelves. Then glancing back to Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, he stated, "The cultivation methods on this row are suitable for women, so you two come over here."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Mu Ning both looked at Luo Zheng's direction, who tilted his chin as if permitting them. Only then did the two ladies follow Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>Promptly, Immortal Book pointed to the ground and a circle of light became visible. Within that circle of light, there was a thin line that shot out continuously right from its edge. "Who wants to come in first?"</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes flashed, and she immediately stepped into the light circle.</p>

  <p>As soon as Ning Yudie was inside the light circle, the entire bookshelf started to shake non-stop. The mountainous bookshelf shook as if there was an earthquake.</p>

  <p>"Bang..."</p>

  <p>All the books on the bookshelf started to emit a faint golden light. After a while, a large book unforcedly came out from the top shelf and eventually landed in front of Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book gaped at her and then let out a laugh. "You are very lucky to get the Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture. At the later stages of the cultivation method, you will find that it also contains the Law of Causality. I think it also belongs to the Transcendent Divine Might that Luo Luo Zheng mentioned." Judging by his words, Immortal Book disdained this so-called Transcendent Divine Might!</p>

  <p>A gentle smile tugged at the corner of Luo Zheng's mouth after he listened to the exhilarated outburst of Immortal Book. He mused that although Immortal Book loved to show off, he was nicely accommodating. Apart from this, Luo Luo Zheng also learned from the cyan dragon that the Transcendent Divine Might was the best kind of cultivation methods in the universe.</p>

  <p>Since Ning Yudie could get one Transcendent Divine Might, she was in luck.</p>

  <p>"Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture..." Yudie's face also beamed with excitement. "Is it that powerful?"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book glimpsed at Ning Yudie briefly and then answered, "You cultivated the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess before and dispersed your cultivation base nine times. So I must say, you indeed laid a good foundation for yourself. But the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess is not impeccable and not a complete cultivation method, and finishing it off will not be easy. So cultivating the Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture is naturally ten or a hundred times better. You can enter the book and have a look to check whether what I say is correct or not."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie agreed. She realized that ever since she entered the Immortal Mansion, there were many things she had seen that were so difficult for her to understand. Thus the cultivation methods in the library might surely be complicated!</p>

  <p>With this in her thoughts, she hastily immersed her perception into the Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture in great anticipation. It was after five minutes when Ning Yudie withdrew from the book. Her face wore an excited expression as she grabbed Luo Zheng's hand and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, this cultivation method..."</p>

  <p>"Is this cultivation method good and suitable for you?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled and asked her gently.</p>

  <p>"This cultivation method is perfectly tailor-made for me! On top of that, the mysteries contained within are all exceptionally marvelous. I, I..." As the leader of Cloud Hall, Ning Yudie had experienced a lot of major events.</p>

  <p>Whenever hearing her subordinates in the Cloud Hall report everything to her, Ning Yudie could remain calm, no matter how important or urgent those matters were. However, she was so excited at this moment and couldn't control her emotion at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was now curious as to what kind of cultivation method the Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture held, and how it had aroused so much excitement for Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Only after a while did Ning Yudie calm down. Just like Immortal Book had said, the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess she cultivated was to build a solid foundation for her. If she wanted to break through and make great progress, the Green Frost Mysterious Ice Scripture was the most suitable cultivation method for her.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Ning Yudie had regained her composure, Luo Luo Zheng gently probed her,</p>

  <p>"You still haven't told me what happened to you."</p>

  <p>The corner of Yudie's mouth curved into a teasing smile, and she snorted. "I might surpass you if I were to practice this cultivation method!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chuckled, "Then I'll have to do my best!"</p>

  <p>While they were still engaged in their talk, a cultivation method had been chosen for Mu Ning to practice. A large book slowly fell and landed beside her. Compared to Ning Yudie, Mu Ning was a little more indifferent towards the cultivation method that she got. What she obtained was a cultivation method with wind attribute.</p>

  <p>Even though Aura's expression was indifferent, she was as determined as Ning Yudie. Knowing that both the resources and the cultivation methods in the Eastern Region were nothing as compared to those in the Central Region, she needed to push herself harder to catch up with the warriors in the latter. She desired to be as outstanding and powerful like them.</p>

  <p>Since the two women had chosen their cultivation methods, it was Luo Zheng's turn now.</p>

  <p>The cultivation methods on this row of bookshelves were suitable for women to cultivate. Now that it was time for Luo Luo Zheng to choose a cultivation method, Immortal Book brought him further into the depths of the library.</p>

  <p>After stopping at another row of bookshelves, Immortal Book once again drew a circle of light on the floor and said to Luo Luo Zheng, "You can go in now."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tilted his head and took a step into the light circle. Soon after, the entire bookshelf began to shake once again!</p>

  <p>"Bang..."</p>

  <p>This process was considered normal. As the bookshelves rumbled, a book at the second row of the shelves emerged.</p>

  <p>With an amused expression, Immortal Book exclaimed, "Not bad. It seems that the Heaven and Earth Sword Skill has chosen you..."</p>

  <p>However, another large book from the bookshelf slowly moved out, halting Immortal Book in midsentence!</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, both Saul and Immortal Book looked surprised.</p>

  <p>There was no restriction imposed on selecting books in the library. So it was only appropriate for Luo Luo Zheng to pick out a few more cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Only Immortal Book could pick out the most suitable cultivation method for the warrior who wanted to choose one. Under normal circumstances, only one book would appear at one time, and now it seemed like there were two cultivation methods suitable for Luo Luo Zheng to cultivate at the same time.</p>

  <p>"It's rare to see two cultivation methods appearing at the same time, but I've seen such a scene before." Immortal Book's astonished expression immediately vanished as a faint smile appeared on his face again.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was done commenting, a third book on the bookshelf slowly moved, revealing half of it, seemingly to be about to fall from the bookshelf as well.</p>

  <p>"The third book..." Immortal Book's face now was wearing startled and amazed expression!</p>

  <p>Saul frowned and asked Immortal Book, "Does something wrong happen to your secret method? Why would three cultivation methods appear at the same time?"</p>

  <p>The secret method of Immortal Book was to help the warriors choose the most suitable cultivation methods for them. And there was usually one fitted for every warrior. Sometimes, there would be two books appearing, which could be because the warrior was almost equally good in two aspects. But now, three cultivation methods had appeared, and Saul suspected that there was something wrong with the secret method.</p>

  <p>Soon after Saul raised his suspicion, the other books also started to fall.</p>

  <p>The fourth book, the fifth book, the sixth book...</p>

  <p>Witnessing what was transpiring, there was a hint of fear emanating from Immortal Book. "Back off!"</p>
