  <p>However, for war sages and Soul Sea Realm masters, they were baits and could end their lives.</p>

  <p>Back then, many war sages and a small number of Soul Sea Realm masters from different races ended up dead in the Cursed Land. This resulted in they being duped and sweet-talked to enter the transmission arrays. That was how they perished.</p>

  <p>Later it had become an unwritten rule on the Sea God Continent that both war sages and Soul Sea Realm masters didn't use transmission arrays.</p>

  <p>Nothing prepared them to what they would encounter if they randomly entered any transmission array. They had to be extra cautious, since not refraining from entering the transmission array that led them to the Cursed Land was dangerous. They would encounter a shameful death.</p>

  <p>In front of them were the two war sages who suddenly appeared in the Tower of Sin. Lots of top-level war lords who witnessed stood in disbelief.</p>

  <p>There were tests that were carried out by the Demon Night and ogre race earlier on.</p>

  <p>They had tried to make their top-level war lords break through to the next level directly in the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>There was a curse. Anyone who fought in the Cursed Land would suffer the consequences. The effect was death. Such barriers didn't exist in the Tower of Sin. This led to races figuring out that if war sages and Soul Sea Realm masters were not allowed to enter the Tower of Sin, would it work if war lords made the breakthrough in the Tower of Sin and became war sages there? Would the whole process elude them from the punishment?</p>

  <p>The result was surprising.</p>

  <p>The curse never inflicted any casualty at first. Those martial artist who managed to become war sages in the Tower of Sin were not eliminated by the curse. However, that was short lived. After they promoted themselves to war sages and stayed in the Tower of Sin for ten days, the effects of the curse were seen since one after the other newly-turned war sages died.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because they were in the Tower of Sin, those who completed their breakthrough and became war sages in the Tower of Sin did not die immediately. While those war sages who had directly rushed into the Cursed Land almost died a miserable death right on the spot in an instant.</p>

  <p>The few war sages who reached the new level from the top-level war lords in the Tower of Sin had a chronic death. Their body would fester and start rotting gradually. They would suffer all kinds of pain and finally die in agony.</p>

  <p>That experience frightened the top-level war lords of any race. The thought of that held them back from breaking through in the Tower of Sin. Instead, they opted to leave the Tower of Sin and the Cursed Land when they planned to make a breakthrough. They went for good without returning.</p>

  <p>Colin and Neil were not strangers to Esther Ling and the top-level war lords of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Having been the top-level war lords previously, the two ogres also had been seat owners. They had searched for golden chances in the Dark Nether Cave which cut their lives short.</p>

  <p>It shocked Esther Ling as well as the other creatures who thought they were dead all this while. As if that was not enough, they had broken through and become war sages. The most shocking part was to see them in the Tower of Sin. Esther Ling was more shocked by this news. This revelation too shocked the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"According to the situation at hand, the ogres were alert and knew of the two ogres. They knew they had a backup support!" Now Madeline and Elder Mei realized why Malcom and Maurice were full of themselves when they confronted them. After all, they had two more superior beings.</p>

  <p>"we are ruined..." Fabian looked at Jarrod. Fear took control of his body.</p>

  <p>How would he act like everything was normal now?</p>

  <p>Jarrod wasn't any better than Fabian and fear also engulfed him. Everything took a different turn now. After believing that they had seen a light at the end of the tunnel, hey suddenly found that everything was shattered.</p>

  <p>Everything not even the surrounding was safe and fresh to feel confident in.</p>

  <p>The human race was troubled. They had counted their eggs before they hatched. They had felt lucky to have the Demon Night on their side, but the emergence of the two ogres ruined everything. They tried figuring out how the ogre war sages had managed to appear here without receiving any punishment.</p>

  <p>Had the ogre race worked out a way to break the spell of the Cursed Land and be alive? This was impossible! Having existed for many years, the curse of the Cursed Land was not easy to break. It was next to impossible for anyone to survive the curse and break it.</p>

  <p>The two being in front of them alive and kicking answered their questions.</p>

  <p>They had survived. And now their presence had one agenda?.</p>

  <p>"Esther, ha-ha! You are still a top-level war lord. Me being alive and kicking was the last thing you would have thought, right?" Colin burst into sarcastic laughter.</p>

  <p>There was a reason Esther Ling didn't become a sage earlier. Neither the Demon Night nor the Heavenly Feather Sacred Land wanted Maurice to be the strongest person among the seat owners. The competition was intense in the Tower of Sin; if she broke through, she had no option but to leave the Tower of Sin. This would leave Maurice with all the privileges, which was something that neither Demon Night nor the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would expect to see.</p>

  <p>Unless another top-level war lord emerged and was able to overcome Maurice, Esther's hands were tied and she had to continue to suppress her cultivation level. But if a top-level war lord appeared in the Demon Night and could defeat Maurice, Esther Ling would then leave the Tower of Sin, leave the Cursed Land, and return to the sacred place of Demon Night to break through.</p>

  <p>Back then Colin and Neil were both top-level war lords, the same as Esther Ling. However, Esther Ling was way much ahead of Colin and Neil. At that time, Collin and Neil only ranked after top forty, which made them no matches for Esther Ling.</p>

  <p>Tables turned?</p>

  <p>Collin and Neil had both become war sages while Esther was still a top-level war lord.</p>

  <p>The once defeated foes had surpassed her. Her facial expression was like an open book that both Collins and Neil could read.</p>

  <p>The two ogres' appearance destroyed everything. The equity and balance created would now be in favour of the ogres. This would mean that the Demon Night was in hot soup. They would face the wrath of the ogres.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how did you pull through? You have already become war sages.</p>

  <p>What's the secret to you having no barriers entering the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>Esther Ling asked.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" Patriarch Colin laughed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Hahahaha!" Neil joined him as he let out a hysterical laugh.</p>

  <p>There was a sarcastic laughter in the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Maurice, Malcom and the ogre top-level war lords laughed all in unison.</p>

  <p>Their faces described happy souls trying to mimic the surprised face of Esther Ling.</p>

  <p>Before the other races came to protest the monopoly of the ogre race on the Tower of Sin, the ogre race was at the height of power and splendor and it almost dominated the Tower of Sin. However, after the other races formed allies and forced them to share the Tower of Sin, the situation for the ogre race declined. After Amber appeared, the black horse led the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to soar to the top. For the past hundred years, whether it was outside of the Cursed Land or inside the Tower of Sin, the Demon Night had been suppressing the ogres wherever they went.</p>

  <p>Although the ogres were extremely annoyed, they didn't have any way to change the situation. Most of time, they could only bear with it and swallow the pain.</p>

  <p>Everything was turned around. Today. The two ogre war sages were present in the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>A war sage was so mighty that it could sweep through the entire Tower of Sin. Considering the strongest martial artist in the Tower of Sin was only a top-level war lord, the two mighty war sages with the ogres meant super powerful combination.</p>

  <p>The powerful collaboration of ogre war sages and ogre war lords implied that the Tower of Sin would be under control of the ogres again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was so pissed off by the hysterical laughter of the ogre top-level war lords and the two war sages. How could they dare laugh especially on this critical situation? Luo Luo Zheng suddenly shook his head with a bored look. He took a deep breath, then infused his life vitality into his chest and suddenly shouted out loud, "What is so funny that you two dunderheads are laughing about? What's so special about being war sages?"</p>

  <p>The ogre top-level war lords and the two war sages only laughed in a hasty manner. They did not use their forceful energy when they laughed to intimidate the crowd, while Luo Luo Zheng had infused life vitality when he shouted.</p>

  <p>So his loud voice instantly drowned out all the laughter.</p>

  <p>There was a grave silence on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin. One would think there was no one present. This was after Luo Luo Zheng ended uttering his words.</p>
