  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just at that moment, a beautiful young girl suddenly floated in and casually asked, "Luo Luo Zheng, need some help?"</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner hadn't even been able to detect that the young girl was there before hearing her voice, 'When did this young girl come? Was she here the entire time? Why didn't I, or rather, why couldn't I notice her?</p>

  <p>Is this girl a cultivator of the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>Who is she? Is there actually a young girl of the Illuminating Soul Realm among the members of Luo family?'</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's strength had astonished the Blood Prisoner, this guy was a nature creature and couldn't defeat him. The Blood Prisoner wasn't powerful enough, but he was still able to fly. Luo Luo Zheng was a nature creature and couldn't catch up with him, so the Blood Prisoner had a great advantage and confidence when fighting against him.</p>

  <p>But it would have been different if Luo Luo Zheng, along with all his strength, also had the help of a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm. And this young girl was at a cultivation level several grades higher than him. The Blood Prisoner didn't have the confidence to defeat her.</p>

  <p>"No thank you sis. I don't need any help. I am going to end this battle now." Luo Luo Zheng replied sweetly with a smile.</p>

  <p>What did that mean? The Blood Prisoner couldn't understand. Luo Luo Zheng thought he could end this battle without the girl's help? His tone suggested that he was about to kill the Blood Prisoner at any time? 'Is this guy so na?ve as to believe that?'</p>

  <p>Before the Blood Prisoner could recover from his shock and come to his senses, he saw another silver light flashing in Luo Zheng's hand and rushing towards his face.</p>

  <p>The silver light was the broken flying knife!</p>

  <p>It came instantly and unexpectedly. Hurriedly, the Blood Prisoner tried to dodge, but before he could even move, he felt a severe pain which almost stopped his mind.</p>

  <p>"Boo!"</p>

  <p>The broken flying knife flew right across the Blood Prisoner's neck, dismembering it from the body as easily as hot lava through butter. Fresh blood spurted from his broken neck.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner's head rolled down to one side, and the gloomy red light in his eyes dimmed slowly. It turned out that it was in fact him, who was too na?ve.</p>

  <p>Seeing the inclining dead body of the Blood Prisoner, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. When it came to plain and simple fighting capacity, the Blood Prisoner, with his ability to turn into a blood ogre was powerful indeed.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he could have easily defeated Dick and was perhaps, even qualified to fight against Jacques.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, warriors practicing in common places other than the Cloud Sect had very few resources around them and were rarely able to find a chance to cultivate the soul. Such warriors couldn't have resisted Luo Zheng's Spiritual Thorn attack.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had wanted to end the fight sooner, he could have easily used that attack and turned the Blood Prisoner's mind into a complete mess. The latter would have been left a complete idiot in that case.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, warriors who practiced and grew up in Cloud Sect had either a powerful soul or a special way to protect the soul.</p>

  <p>After the Blood Prisoner had died, malicious Mu Ning emerged from his body and rose continuously for some time. Generally, the malicious Mu Ning was colorless, but if being strong enough, it would often be a bright shade of red. And given a large enough quantity condensing all at once, it could even turn fresh red.</p>

  <p>However, the malicious Mu Ning of the Blood Prisoner was even worse-- dark red!</p>

  <p>'He had taken in so much malicious Mu Ning! How many creatures had this guy killed?' Luo Luo Zheng thought indifferently.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning entered Luo Zheng's body continuously and gathered inside.</p>

  <p>If one were to compare, the malicious Mu Ning Luo Luo Zheng had gathered after killing those people just now was hardly worth mentioning against this large amount from the prisoner's body.</p>

  <p>It was a long while before the Mu Ning in the body of the Blood Prisoner had finished gathering into Luo Zheng's. It finally turned into three dark red crystals.</p>

  <p>'Three blood-colored crystals stand for three wisps of malicious Mu Ning, I believe?' Luo Luo Zheng could feel that these three blood-colored crystals had a special energy, which was made from the curse of thousands of creatures, cast before they died. It was obvious that the curse of dying people was not something nice to hold on to.</p>

  <p>However, everything had its advantages and disadvantages. The malicious Mu Ning could devour a person's body if kept long enough, but if the person made use of it, its powers could be significant and terrible.</p>

  <p>For example, the Blood Prisoner didn't have a foundation as solid as Dick had, but the strength he had burst was far more powerful than Dick's, which was the result of the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>'These three wisps of malicious Mu Ning are hidden in my body, but they can be harmful to me. Fortunately, I have connection with the Killing Sword Mountain and can keep them on the mountain.' Luo Luo Zheng ordered in his mind.</p>

  <p>The three wisps of malicious Mu Ning disappeared from inside his body in an instant, and appeared on the mountain. He sensed a new energy flow somewhere in his body.</p>

  <p>'Wow. It looks like it's super easy to save the malicious Mu Ning on the Killing Sword Mountain. I wonder how much malicious Mu Ning I can save there.'</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, a figure standing not far tried to flee.</p>

  <p>This was Ken.</p>

  <p>It was beyond his imagination that Luo Luo Zheng could have killed the prisoner so easily.</p>

  <p>After all, the Blood Prisoner was being chased by the government and Cloud Sect jointly. He was supposed to be almost invincible in these counties. The government and Cloud Sect had sent several powerful men to surround and attack the Blood Prisoner, but he had still managed to run away.</p>

  <p>Now his neck had been cut off by Luo Luo Zheng in an instant...</p>

  <p>Ken felt a chill running through his back. In his mind, he couldn't think of anything else except to flee.</p>

  <p>However, just as he had moved a few steps, a young girl blocked his way out of nowhere. She had a really big smile. Yan asked in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Uncle, where are you going?"</p>
