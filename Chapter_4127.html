<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Othniel was the most powerful among the six Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Only a few could be a match for Chaos Ancient Gods. Even if the Chaos Ancient Gods confronted those who were stronger than them, they could manage to run away unscathed.</p>

  <p>That was why Othniel successfully fled from the battle in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he encountered an unprecedented crisis.</p>

  <p>He activated the truth power in an attempt to teleport himself away.</p>

  <p>But even after releasing all his truth power, he couldn't escape nor get rid of the space cage that enclosed him.</p>

  <p>Othniel was shocked that someone in the chaos could disable his space theurgy.</p>

  <p>He was fully aware that the Evil God couldn't do that.</p>

  <p>'This guy is using the power of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Had we been outside the Source World, he wouldn't be able to trap me even if he was ten times stronger.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately, we are in the Source World.</p>

  <p>I was caught unaware.</p>

  <p>If I had known that he possessed such powers, I wouldn't have come here.</p>

  <p>But it's too late to regret now, ' Othniel pondered as he fumed with anger.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Ways-blending Energy that over ten thousand Evil Gods released blasted simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Each Ways-blending Energy exploded, producing a blazing golden light.</p>

  <p>It was understandable how thousands of Ways-blending Energy could be fatal.</p>

  <p>"You want to take my life? That's not gonna happen!" Othniel shouted.</p>

  <p>Faint energy started to fluctuate on the surface of his body, spreading from his trunk and across the length of his limbs.</p>

  <p>The energy turned into a layer of azure space armor, quickly covering his huge body.</p>

  <p>Making the space armor almost cost Othniel all the truth power. The thick space armor protected him from any energy including the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The space armor shielded Othniel from the outburst of thousands of Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>After all the deadly explosions of the Ways-blending Energy, he remained uninjured.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Little useless tricks! You really thought you can hurt me?"</p>

  <p>Othniel provoked triumphantly.</p>

  <p>The Evil Gods condescendingly looked at Othniel. One of them asked,</p>

  <p>"Have you always been this stupid?"</p>

  <p>Othniel was confused. Then he realized that there were still over ten thousand Evil Gods standing on his back.</p>

  <p>He almost forgot that he had to deal with so many opponents. This was the first time that he had been in such a dangerous situation!</p>

  <p>The Evil Gods stretched out their hands as they mustered the strength to gather the Ways-blending Energy once more.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>All the Ways-blending Energy flew to the sky emitting blazing lights that shone as bright as the sun.</p>

  <p>Each Ways-blending Energy pierced Othniel gaping a hole on his body.</p>

  <p>After being hit too many times, his massive body became riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>He started to descend from the sky like a giant wrecked ship.</p>

  <p>Just like that, a Chaos Ancient God perished in the hands of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In the past chaotic eras, there had also been cases where the Sons of Truth, namely Chaos Ancient Gods had been slaughtered.</p>

  <p>However, those powerful beings were killed by ruling forces.</p>

  <p>Even in the battle of the Pear Hill, the two Chaos Ancient Gods were killed by the crowd and not a single person.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God finished Othniel off on his own. It was indeed an unforeseen event.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer stared blankly at the falling Othniel as he sensed fear overwhelming him.</p>

  <p>'Othniel died like this?</p>

  <p>Having been killed by a human?' Divine Farmer thought to himself in sheer shock.</p>

  <p>When Divine Farmer transformed into a monster a few moments ago, he felt invincible as if nothing could hurt him a bit.</p>

  <p>But after he witnessed Othniel's death, he was not sure if he could survive the Evil God's attacks. At that moment, he only wanted to escape; but at the thought of even Othniel failing to escape, panic and frustration flooded him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>More Evil Gods teleported themselves to Divine Farmer's side. Once they were near him, the Ways-blending Energy could explode in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Please don't...</p>

  <p>It doesn't have to come this far!</p>

  <p>What do you want from me? I can..."</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer tried to beg for mercy, but the Evil God was indifferent and simply ignored his pleas.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! His voice slowly faded as he ended up being blasted into pieces.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch, on the other hand, was more courageous compared to Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>He raised the sword in his hand with a face full of determination. It was evident that he wanted to fight until his last breath.</p>

  <p>"Life and Death Holy Way!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Life and Death Holy Way!" he shouted more ferociously.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Holy Way surrounded him at his command.</p>

  <p>Every time an Evil God approached him, the Evil God would be trapped in the Life and Death Holy Way and die on the spot.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of Evil Gods started to walk on the Life and Death Holy Way a few seconds later. Even before they realized, all of them had already stopped breathing.</p>

  <p>The Evil God could, in fact, terminate Yellow Thearch more efficiently.</p>

  <p>However, he preferred to torture him.</p>

  <p>"Hey, aren't you Zheng's enemy?" an Evil God asked casually as he floated beside Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>"That's none of your business!" Yellow Thearch roared, "Life and Death Holy Way!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God who spoke to him was dragged to the Life and Death Holy Way and walked down it silently.</p>

  <p>After he got rid of one, another Evil God appeared.</p>

  <p>"He created me. I ought to be grateful to him," the Evil God said.</p>

  <p>"You? A grateful person? Who are you kidding?" Yellow Thearch stared at the Evil God scornfully and dragged him to the Life and Death Holy Way as well.</p>

  <p>'If the Evil God was really grateful, he wouldn't have joined the Black Ship, ' Yellow Thearch thought as he dismissed the Evil God's words.</p>

  <p>"If I take you down, then Zheng wouldn't have a chance to get even with you. He might be disappointed," another Evil God said.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to let me go?" Yellow Thearch asked lifting his head.</p>

  <p>"No," the Evil God replied as he flashed an evil grin. "I will be happy to see him disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Quit playing me and shut up!" Yellow Thearch said furiously. He stuck another Evil God in the holy way again.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Holy Way was indeed powerful. No one could survive and make it out alive.</p>

  <p>Although it was a brilliant bloodline theurgy, one needed to use the bloodline power to make it work. Once the bloodline power ran out, any theurgy couldn't be unleashed anymore.</p>

  <p>One by one, the Evil Gods stepped into the holy way and gradually died.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yellow Thearch's bloodline power was quickly decreasing.</p>

  <p>His face turned pale as Yellow Thearch was running out of the bloodline power. His handsome face started to wrinkle and he had aged in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>He couldn't hold on any longer and it hit him–he was already dying. He suddenly recited the Truth of Godly Way and went to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch had married a woman from the Pure race on the Other Shore. Male members of this race looked like monsters while its female members resembled ordinary human women who gave off an unworldly aura.</p>

  <p>When he was depressed back then, he spent most of his time keeping this woman company on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch knew that he was about to die, so he seized one last moment to enter the Other Shore to say goodbye to her.</p>

  <p>When he saw the woman, she almost ran to come and greet him. Her eyes glowed ecstatically the second she met him.</p>

  <p>As a creature on the Other Shore, she couldn't go to the Source World to be with Yellow Thearch. She could only patiently wait for his return.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, honey..." Yellow Thearch said.</p>

  <p>The woman frowned as she asked curiously, "What happened? Are you alright?"</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his sentence, his body in the Source World had been shattered by the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>He vanished in front of the woman as soon as his entire flesh was destroyed.</p>
