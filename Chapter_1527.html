  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Layne was again preparing to launch the same attack by spreading his wings and flying at Luo Luo Zheng. He was hell-bent on destroying Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To wantonly indulge in his brute strength and practice by using Luo Luo Zheng as a target, this was a bit of a pleasure for Layne!</p>

  <p>However, this time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't appear to be evading Layne's attacks, but instead, he chose to face him head-on. His left hand twisted slightly, while his right hand was raised to one side!</p>

  <p>"Grappling..."</p>

  <p>As the martial artists saw this, their expressions became both awed and concerned. They exchanged curious looks and then turned back to the titanic battle which raged outside the city.</p>

  <p>Ogre martial artists mostly focused on practicing body refining.</p>

  <p>Grappling was the most basic of martial arts. It could be classified as a basic fighting technique! How could such a technique beat the might which Layne wielded?</p>

  <p>Was Luo Luo Zheng counting on capturing Layne by using the grappling technique?</p>

  <p>Would Layne even fall for that?</p>

  <p>More and more, they felt that there must be something wrong with Luo Zheng's head. Clearly, the sun had addled his brains!</p>

  <p>Layne also laughed coldly as he flapped his wings slightly behind his back. His flying posture became even more elegant as he accumulated speed, and then launched himself to charge straight at Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Although the strength that Luo Luo Zheng had displayed couldn't even withstand a single blow, Layne's alertness hadn't decreased in the slightest.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng had shown his true strength and skills!</p>

  <p>But no matter what tricks this guy was playing, Layne always thought that Luo Luo Zheng was under his control. Playing tricks under his absolute strength was meaningless.</p>

  <p>"It's over!"</p>

  <p>As he rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng, the purple flame in his hand rapidly bloomed like a wildly growing flower!</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Zheng's right hand shot out like a bolt of lightning, and with a gentle squeeze of his hand, he snuffed out the purple flame in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Then, like a snake, his left hand grabbed onto Layne's arm. Having underestimated Luo Zheng's strength, Layne was dumbstruck as an unfathomable force now quietly appeared!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A clear shattering sound could be heard by all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just broken Layne's arm using only one hand!</p>

  <p>A hint of disbelief flashed across Layne's face as another ball of fire appeared in his free hand. He wanted to smash it right against Luo Zheng's head again!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng once again extinguished the flames with lightning speed, and at the same time he grabbed Layne's remaining hand!</p>

  <p>Within this grasp, Layne felt as if he was being clamped down on by a pair of pliers. There was almost no chance for him to move at all.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene from the top of the city wall, the surrounding martial artists became even more confused.</p>

  <p>Once warriors reached the Soul Sea Realm, the competition between them was either based on their life vitality cultivation or their martial skills.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden use of the grappling technique was already quite inconceivable. Why would Layne also want to 'play' with Luo Luo Zheng? The two of them were locked in a stalemate. Were they going to compete in terms of strength?</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Layne had also been secretly complaining in his heart. Although Layne had guessed that Luo Luo Zheng possessed his own trump card, he hadn't considered that Luo Zheng's trump card would actually be using his own immense physical strength.</p>

  <p>Where did this guy get such a terrifying strength?!</p>

  <p>Layne's size was considered to be small, when compared to the other ogre warriors, but he was still more than twice as tall and sturdy as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a strange thing to be grappled by Luo Luo Zheng like this.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng did not give him time to think it over for long.</p>

  <p>Layne had cultivated both body and life vitality. Besides cultivating the Fire Law, his body refining technique was also extremely powerful!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't even give him the chance to use this!</p>

  <p>While Layne was still puzzled and plotting a counterattack, a force ten times stronger than before was being transmitted from Luo Zheng's powerfully muscled arm!</p>

  <p>With such a boundless force, Layne simply didn't have the strength to resist. Or, it could be argued that he simply had no time to resist.</p>

  <p>He rapidly felt a heart-wrenching pain. His body, which was twice the size of Luo Zheng's, was being forcibly torn apart by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a red dot of light rapidly flew into the main city, a dense cluster of Illusion Points emerged from the ravaged body of Layne, and these yellow dots of light immediately shot into Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>Ten thousand?</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand?</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand?.</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty thousand!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had originally thought that Layne only had 200, 000 Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng killed him, he would have been able to obtain one hundred thousand Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Layne had accumulated nearly three hundred thousand Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng originally had 70, 000 Illusion Points. However, after absorbing the 140, 000 Illusion Points, the number of Illusion Points within his body suddenly shot up to 210, 000!</p>

  <p>However, as for the many cultivators on the city wall, they were not envious of Luo Luo Zheng. The vast majority of them even held expressions of suspicion on their faces.</p>

  <p>They weren't even able to evaluate what had just happened, because they couldn't even begin to understand what had just happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been able to fight back before, so why had the two of them become locked in an inexplicable fight, and how did Layne suddenly become torn to shreds by Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>This kind of battle was beyond common sense.</p>

  <p>After a long while, one of the ogre martial artists finally said, "It's such an injustice that Layne lost like this? He simply didn't display his true strength!"</p>

  <p>"Layne is probably very upset!"</p>

  <p>"You are right. His true strength had not been unleashed at all!"</p>

  <p>"After he revives, he'll definitely come and find this human warrior."</p>

  <p>An almost imperceptible smile once again appeared on Luo Zheng's face when he heard this.</p>

  <p>This was exactly what he desired.</p>

  <p>Layne had so many Illusion Points. Killing him only once was simply too much of a waste!</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Luo Zheng had shown weakness earlier was not because he wanted to deceive Layne, but to turn the tide when he was later caught off guard. Although Layne's strength was not weak, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't put him in his place yet.</p>

  <p>In this Illusion Battlefield, there might be a martial artist who Luo Luo Zheng had difficulty defeating or even had the power to defeat Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, the universe was too big. Luo Luo Zheng was very talented, however, the super talents in the universe, like Layla, couldn't be underestimated. In the Passing the Torch, Luo Luo Zheng might have been able to suppress her in all directions. In terms of strength, he was definitely a little better than her, but it had still not been an easy task to defeat Layla. Moreover, there were still many other ace talents in the universe. They might even be stronger than Layla and with a richer heritage.</p>

  <p>The battle outside the main city was just the beginning on the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not expect to learn from these battles or achieve further growth.</p>

  <p>His only goal was to gain as many Illusion Points as possible.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had pretended to be weak and allowed Layne to thrash him over and over again. Now, he had used an extremely ordinary skill-- grappling, to capture Layne. Then he had used his powerful strength to kill Layne.</p>

  <p>Layne was definitely not convinced. With his background, he must still have had many trump cards that he could not have used in time. Feelings of unwillingness filled his heart. After Layne revived in the main city, he would immediately challenge Luo Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>This would give Luo Luo Zheng a second chance to kill Layne.</p>

  <p>Although he had killed Layne once and already obtained half of his Illusion Points, Layne still had 140, 000 Illusion Points. If Luo Luo Zheng could kill Layne once again, then he would obtain another 70, 000 Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>"Hey, don't you want to hide in the city for a while? If Layne revives, he will definitely come to find you!"</p>

  <p>The person who spoke was a human warrior. Most people felt that Luo Zheng's victory was inexplicable. They also suspected that Luo Luo Zheng must have won by a fluke.</p>

  <p>The human warrior showed concern about Luo Luo Zheng out of good intentions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just gotten such a large amount of Illusion Points, it would be a huge loss if Layne had to take them back with interest.</p>

  <p>Hearing this kind reminder, Luo Luo Zheng only smiled and nodded towards the human warrior. However, he didn't move his feet. He remained standing outside the city, looking in the direction of the main gate with an indifferent expression as he quietly waited.</p>

  <p>In the main city, a dot of red light was slowly floating.</p>

  <p>As the red dot of light continuously fluttered about, it slowly began to grow larger. The fingertip-sized dot of light gradually became the size of a fist, and then rapidly expanded to become a ball of light with a diameter of ten feet. This ball of light was filled with a strong Life Law!</p>

  <p>Revival in the Illusion Battlefield was a bit different from the revival in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>After one died in the Illusion Space, they would be kicked out of the space. When a defeated martial artist entered the Illusion Space again, there would be another projection of him.</p>

  <p>While on the Illusion Battlefield, after a martial artist had died, he had to rely on the power of the heavens to completely 'revive' himself. Thus, when some martial artists discovered that this ball of light was filled with an intense Life Law, they simply didn't go outside of the city. Instead, they specifically searched for these masses of light that had been revived to perceive the Life Law in them.</p>

  <p>In any case, there were endless deaths outside of the main city, causing endless resurrections. Thus, the main city was filled with floating red lights, one after another. For many martial artists that didn't have the chance to perceive high-level Original Laws, this was also an opportunity for enriching their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a figure slowly formed within the ball of light!</p>

  <p>After the figure was fully formed, his body suddenly trembled. He came out of the ball of light and shot a fierce stare at the group of martial artists that had surrounded him to meditate on the Life Law. Then, he flew out of the city!</p>
