<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3162 Senior Disciples </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As they made their way to the back of the Flow Tower, they went down a long path silently. Not long after they moved a certain distance, Luo Zheng looked up to see a large bell hanging over his head.</p>

  <p>It immediately hit him that this bell alone was responsible for alerting the entire Heart Flow Sect of the passing of a month.</p>

  <p>He stared at it in wonder till they passed it and went further along the road and stopped once they reached the end of the cliff.</p>

  <p>It was perfect to just stand and overlook the scenery as there were no clouds that could block the view. Nature's beauty was laid bare to them.</p>

  <p>On the other end of the cliff, there was an exquisite terrace with railings etched with intricate designs.</p>

  <p>Imran continued to lead Luo Zheng till they arrived on the patio. They weren't the only ones there. Instead, there were more than twenty people gathered there already.</p>

  <p>At first, these people seemed slothful, but an unusual light in their eyes vouched for their excellence.</p>

  <p>"Greetings my brothers. I have brought Luo Zheng here." Imran respectfully bowed and cupped his hands towards them.</p>

  <p>Back at the Flow Tower, when Luo Zheng had entered for the first time, only Milo was present among the elite members. Therefore, no one here knew his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're here! I've heard a lot about you!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, please sit here!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the atmosphere in the terrace had changed with them walking over to Luo Zheng, putting their arm around him, greeting him and escorting him to the seat of honor. It was as if Luo Zheng was a noble figure to be treated with such respect.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this, Imran shook his head at their reactions.</p>

  <p>The treatment he had received from these same senior disciples was worlds apart from what Luo Zheng had got.</p>

  <p>This was the core circle of the Heart Flow Sect. Ninety percent of the resources of the sword sect had been poured into them, and the strength and seniority were seen as very important.</p>

  <p>Not that long ago, Imran had joined this very circle, but compared to Luo Zheng, he was treated more like a servant. Watching all this unfold at a distance, he couldn't help but feel slightly discredited.</p>

  <p>Of course, Imran wasn't jealous of Luo Zheng, and he had no right to be. After all, Luo Zheng deserved this treatment for performing so well.</p>

  <p>Milo was hailed to be the core of the Heart Flow Sect, and his talents were unmatched. Since Luo Zheng had surpassed Milo, who was the most powerful disciple, Luo Zheng deserved every bit of this treatment and more.</p>

  <p>After being carefully escorted, Luo Zheng took his seat. One by one, each senior disciple stood before him and gave their proper introduction.</p>

  <p>Most of these elite disciples enjoyed a high social status, and more than half of them were descendants of the leaders in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. It was overwhelming how none of them came from humble origins.</p>

  <p>It was common. If one wished to enter the vicinity of Dragon City, they had to pass through numerous barriers and tests like the Sword Wall. Going up the mountain after getting into the Dragon City was no easy task either.</p>

  <p>Most people were only able to become a Oneness Guard.</p>

  <p>Even if somehow they managed to reach the top of the mountain, there were more challenges like getting a separate courtyard house and becoming the elite of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, even the disciples with humble origins yet outstanding talents were hardly able to make it in the end.</p>

  <p>Once the introductions and greetings were finished, they all became more familiar with one another.</p>

  <p>One of the elite disciples of the Heart Flow Sect, who was wearing a cyan hat, walked up to Luo Zheng. His name was Konnor Gao. "I've heard you just entered the Other Shore. I'm amazed by how quickly you've progressed in such a short time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already reached the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm. Not only was he able to integrate with the Strength God Totem but also get much soul crystal on the Other Shore. Naturally, his aura had improved significantly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his remarks, Luo Zheng sat upright and fixed himself before speaking innocently. "Yes, that is true. I explored the Other Shore just a few days ago and I have already entered the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>"So soon?"</p>

  <p>"You must have met with a golden opportunity, right?"</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, Stage Four of the Other Shore is not that easy to reach. It took me a lot of effort to get into the fourth stage!"</p>

  <p>They began discussing among themselves and passed their individual remarks over Luo Zheng's achievements in shock.</p>

  <p>"All of you flatter me." Luo Zheng chuckled, looking at their bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The elites that stood before him all originated from prestigious clans. It was true that it was challenging to get to the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm in such a short time. However, with enough soul crystal, it became a lot easier.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mekhi Chu, another elite disciple sitting next to Luo Zheng, turned to him and spoke up, "Going through the thirteen stages of the Lust World is not difficult for us. However, leaving the Lust World to the next world is a completely different thing."</p>

  <p>Konnor got up and added to Mekhi's statement enthusiastically, "Exactly.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, soul crystal is rare to find and is extremely expensive. It's awfully challenging for one to surpass the Lust World."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he listened intently to the discussions taking place before him, and he curiously asked the senior disciples, "What's the price of the soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>The soul crystal could directly increase the level of his Soul of Light, and Luo Zheng also needed it. When he was on the Other Shore, he didn't ask how much it was worth, and Dorothy didn't mention it either.</p>

  <p>If there was some way he could buy it from somewhere using his divine crystals, he would take advantage of it. He was even prepared to give away the legacies left to him by Chiyou.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng asked his question, all the senior disciples paused to look at each other with their brows raised, switching their gaze between Luo Zheng and themselves. Soon after, they broke out in explosive laughter.</p>

  <p>Helplessly watching their reaction, Luo Zheng leaned forward with curious eyes to ask, "What are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>"As long as you have enough soul crystal, you can pass through all the thirteen stages of the Lust World and reach the Desire World, and your soul can advance to a higher level. It can be called as a holy pill. If anyone were to possess it, why would they want to sell it, Luo Zheng?" Konnor replied, wiping the tears from his eyes from laughing so hard.</p>

  <p>In fact, they were all surprised by his question. They all began to wonder whether the guy who was capable of Instant Enlightenment and who could go up to the tenth floor in the Flow Tower had any common sense at all.</p>

  <p>"That's too exaggerated, Konnor. Although very few people use it for sale, quite a few people are willing to use it for exchange. What's more, the Mice League has auctioned soul crystal before. A finger-size chunk of soul crystal was sold at the auction for sixty million divine crystals," Mekhi said as he gestured the size of the soul crystal using his finger.</p>

  <p>"A finger-size chunk? Sixty million divine crystals?" A hint of astonishment could be seen all over Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The problem is that all the super forces keep soul crystal to cultivate their own people, so you have nowhere to buy it from even if you have divine crystals," Mekhi smiled warmly at Luo Zheng as he explained. "I do wonder how big was the chunk of soul crystal you obtained from the temple."</p>

  <p>The first time when people entered the temple, they could some soul crystal from the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Even the elite disciples who had come up to the mountain weren't able to get a lot of it. Luo Zheng had seen it that day.</p>

  <p>"I only got a finger-size one..."</p>

  <p>"Mine was just a bit bigger than yours..."</p>

  <p>"I heard that Milo had got three finger-size chunks," someone whispered in the distance.</p>

  <p>Once everyone told their experiences, they all eyed Luo Zheng up patiently to hear his answer.</p>

  <p>These elites were well-respected by the Taiyi Heaven Palace, yet they were given a finger-size chunk of crystal on average...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rubbed his forehead and said, "I've got a fist-size chunk of soul crystal in the temple..."</p>

  <p>He made it apparent by a gesture with his fist.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the lively atmosphere faded away as the crowd went into pin-drop silence. After inhaling a few deep breaths, they began eyeing up Luo Zheng as though he wasn't human.</p>

  <p>The rareness of soul crystal was such that the quantity of stored soul crystal in the temple was probably only the size of a few fists. How could Luo Zheng get a fist of it alone for himself?</p>

  <p>After a while, Konnor broke the silence and glanced at Luo Zheng with narrowed eyes. "They said you were of humble origin. I don't believe it..."</p>

  <p>If Konnor were not an elite disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and did dare to be disrespectful to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he would have presumed Luo Zheng to be the illegitimate son of the emperor.</p>

  <p>Seeing their reaction, Luo Zheng began to construct thoughts of his own. 'No wonder Dorothy said that I was well treated by the Heart Flow Sect. But now, it seems that I could obtain a big chunk of soul crystal not because of my own performance, but because Qiu Yinhe was looking out for me secretly.'</p>

  <p>Even though Qiu Yinhe seldom showed up at any event, it was apparent he was helping Luo Zheng out secretly.</p>

  <p>While everyone was still in a daze at their different fates, Konnor quickly changed the topic. "There is only one chance to take the soul crystal. It's also extremely difficult for elites like us to get more of it. But this time, there is another chance. I wonder if you are interested in it, Luo Zheng."</p>
