<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2636 Exhausted </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After entering this world, Emily and the other powerful masters with her had served as the main force.</p>

  <p>She had never even thought that Luo Zheng could be someone who could help.</p>

  <p>After all, the gap between their cultivation was huge, and it was impossible for him to catch up to her. Therefore, Luo Zheng, together with the other elders, and the Wild Gods were all weaker people who needed her protection.</p>

  <p>At first, Emily only considered letting the many exiles, Luther, and Zelda enter this world. After all, in the eyes of the exiles, anyone else was just a burden!</p>

  <p>But after the Strength Equalizing token took effect, the strength Luo Zheng had displayed was no weaker than that of those exiles and even on par to that of Emily and Timotheus.</p>

  <p>Now that they were in dire need of warriors to help clear the path, Emily had naturally let Luo Zheng join them.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't hesitate at all. With a flash, he moved up from behind.</p>

  <p>In the face of the Wights that were constantly advancing like a tide, they would all eventually die of exhaustion if they remained trapped here.</p>

  <p>Now, they could only pull together and fight their way out.</p>

  <p>After that, Emily ordered two exiles from the bigger races to bring up the rearguard, and the group began to make headway!</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Light Spear!"</p>

  <p>Now Ramzi blazed the way for the others, and the silver gray spear was like lightning, launching more than ten strikes in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>More than ten Wights howled in pain and fell writhing to the ground.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, two exiles of the Snake Goddess race rushed up to take the lead. One of them wielded more than ten short swords, and the other one brandished a blade of a strange configuration. With their ferocious attacks, tens of Wights were quickly butchered.</p>

  <p>Then came Timotheus, Leopold, and the others...</p>

  <p>The exiles took turns to attack and slowly forged a path to escape.</p>

  <p>Those who came behind them walked on the path of bodies as they trod over Wight corpses to move forward!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hesitate or relent in his attacks, and he fought fiercely.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't use the Ways-blending Energy in his inner world, his swordsmanship had been perfected while cultivating in the universe.</p>

  <p>Now, his body had risen in the air, and the long sword in his hand struck down at the backs of those Wights that blocked their path in quick succession.</p>

  <p>After the attacks continued for a while, both he and Emily rushed to the front line.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>Emily who was in the front was facing down a group of Wights that had advanced to surround her. Her eyes flashed, and as she tapped her toes on the ground, she let out a wild shout and attacked.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden twist of the saber, she broke all these Wights' necks.</p>

  <p>But this time, she had ignored a Wight to her side. The Wight quietly approached, opened its big mouth, and moved to bite Emily's white neck!</p>

  <p>Under the impact of Strength Equalizing token, even Emily would be a mess of flesh and blood if she was bitten!</p>

  <p>Her expression changed, knowing that there was no way to avoid it, and she closed her eyes as she waited for the inevitable fangs to close in on her flesh.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>However, as the Wight's mouth was only two inches away from her neck, the blade of a flying knife as thin as a cicada's wings, suddenly pierced into the Wight's forehead, knocking it to the ground where it lay twitching.</p>

  <p>A faint smile of relief appeared on Emily's face when she saw the Wight slowly falling down. She had never thought that she would be saved by a young man who was only at the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Then she yanked out the flying knife from the Wight's body using the saber in her hand, and tossed it back to Luo Zheng with a slight nod of her head.</p>

  <p>Both of them kept silent and continued to battle forward!</p>

  <p>Although the number of Wights didn't decrease, they were dumb beasts, and they continued to charge forward without any other thought.</p>

  <p>As for the exiles and Wild Gods, they had initially panicked at the beginning, but now they had quickly calmed down, resolutely advancing with the group.</p>

  <p>They were becoming more and more skilled to fight against these Wights. At first, they had suffered losses, and six of them had died.</p>

  <p>Later, some of the Wild Gods had been injured, but now no one had perished.</p>

  <p>Everyone fought valiantly as they surged forward. They advanced in this way for dozens of miles.</p>

  <p>The number of Wights facing them had slowly begun to decrease. At the beginning, the Wights had just flocked towards them like a mindless wave of death. Later, with the group's tenacious efforts, there were only a few of the Wights standing. And in the end, they were all butchered.</p>

  <p>Now no one obstructed their way.</p>

  <p>At this point, everyone slowed their pace and eventually stopped moving forward.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they didn't want to continue their advance. It was just that the Strength Equalizing token had affected them and drained them in every aspect, until even their physical strength was greatly lessened. As they had continued fighting to gain ground against the Wights, most of them had completely depleted their strength.</p>

  <p>When the group members saw that the Wights were no more, their tensed nerves suddenly relaxed, and they quickly collapsed to the ground. They didn't even want to move their fingers again!</p>

  <p>Even those who had mastered skills in preserving their strengths began to gasp heavily for air.</p>

  <p>And Timotheus, Emily, and the other warriors were no exception.</p>

  <p>Emily was covered in splatters of Wight blood and other smaller bits of Wight bodies. She lifted a corner of her dress and wrung it, producing a gush of blood from the soaked fabric?</p>

  <p>While she was wringing the blood out of her dress, her gaze quietly settled on Luo Zheng, who was calmly sitting opposite to her. A surprised expression had formed on her face.</p>

  <p>After the Strength Equalizing token had taken effect on everyone, their strengths became about the same. Now many exiles were utterly exhausted, but only Luo Zheng looked calm and relaxed.</p>

  <p>"You... Aren't you tired?" Emily asked, both curious and surprised.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>He had killed a number of Wights more than those that Emily had slain.</p>

  <p>It was likely that he had killed the most Wights from the whole group!</p>

  <p>He should have been exhausted.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was using a special kind of swordsmanship. The sword skills he had practiced were distilled to their simplest form. He used the most economical movement to get the best effect. Every time he had brandished the sword, it had consumed only a little bit of physical strength, and therefore, he looked less tired than the others!</p>

  <p>"Let's take a breather," Emily said lightly. "For now we certainly don't have to move on."</p>

  <p>These once powerful exiles now had to rest like the ordinary mortals.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the energy they had consumed would become irreparably lost.</p>

  <p>In many of the exiles' eyes, this was an absurd thing. After all, the physical energy that had been expended was not nearly as much as a billionth of the physical strength they had possessed before. However, they all had to consider that the Strength Equalizing token was domineering, and their massive strengths had been reduced to that of mere mortals now.</p>

  <p>"Okay. I'll be the lookout." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded vaguely and settled against a corner. She leaned back against the pillars at the base of the high platform and closed her eyes helplessly. She couldn't remember when last she had closed her eyes to sleep. It might even have been many tens of thousands of years ago.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she was too tired, for she drifted off to sleep in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>As for the other exiles and Wild Gods, they were also soon snoring in a bone-weary sleep.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng plunged his long sword into the ground and swept his gaze over these warriors. A smile spread over his face. It was indeed strange that the mighty exiles had run out of energy!</p>

  <p>Now that everyone had fallen asleep, Luo Zheng sat cross legged and quietly began to meditate, circulating his bloodline token.</p>

  <p>When they had fought the Wights just now, No. 9527 had urged him continuously to activate the bloodline token and use the Falling Star Palm to vanquish the enemy...</p>

  <p>The Strength Equalizing token was also a truth token.</p>

  <p>No one could resist an attack that used the truth token.</p>

  <p>All the souls, their physical bodies, the life vitality from inside their inner worlds, and the Wild God Power were made equal, to the same level as that of mortals.</p>

  <p>Even all the visual acuity and physical strength of the creatures were made equal.</p>

  <p>However, No. 9527 had told Luo Zheng that only the truth token could not be affected.</p>
