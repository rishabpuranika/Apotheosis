<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3033 Winchell Lin </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Felicity had a confused look plastered on her face as she watched Daisy take off. She asked, "Isn't that man supposed to be outside the Source World? How did he suddenly appear here?"</p>

  <p>Evaristus stared at Dorothy, rubbing his chin in confusion. The news gave him some hope. But if what Dorothy disclosed was untrue, he would feel a sense of dread creeping up his neck until every hair seemed to stand on end.</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head. "He's very discreet in disclosing his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>If not for the present dilemma he is burdened with, he wouldn't have opened up to me."</p>

  <p>Whenever Dorothy attempted to pry into Luo Zheng's background, he resolved to be as prudent as possible, and avoid, as far as he could, any discussion with her.</p>

  <p>"It's okay," Felicity spoke lightly, "and it would be convenient if we recruited such an individual."</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded, weighing her words without surprise. "I hope Uncle Winchell can rush over in time."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Daisy turned into an eerie glow that appeared to ignite as a beacon of light. She rushed over quickly into a cavern.</p>

  <p>Inside the dim cavern was an entryway leading to the main hall where meetings were held. Winchell and Goran sat on the far end of the long table, deep in conversation, their voices hushed. It was almost too quiet to be heard by anyone.</p>

  <p>Daisy rushed inside, her abrupt arrival drawing the attention of both men.</p>

  <p>Winchell hurried to meet her and asked, "Daisy, what makes you look so anxious?"</p>

  <p>"The affairs in the palace keep you occupied that you neglect your own household!" Daisy scowled at her husband, her sharp tone cutting through the silence. "Have you ever considered checking up on your own son?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Winchell wrinkled his nose, his frown deepening.</p>

  <p>"Somebody can rescue Evaristus out of the whirlpool!" Daisy heaved a heavy sigh.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Winchell and Goran stood very still, surprised by the news.</p>

  <p>"But he is now at the Seven-Star Province, besieged by a group of nonhuman monsters. He would only live for five more days if you don't go save him," Daisy echoed what Dorothy just stated.</p>

  <p>One eyebrow cocked, Winchell landed his gaze on Daisy, and he could tell from her expression that she was serious.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Light Palace?" Goran remained silent but widened his eyes significantly.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of it, Master Goran?" Winchell asked.</p>

  <p>Goran responded, "It's the sect that Qiu Yinhe founded. Back then, he had laid out a few Lofty Swords and created several sects, but most of them got destroyed. The Sword Light Palace is one of those that survive and thrive under certain circumstances. I can even recall how I once rewarded a Latent token to someone there."</p>

  <p>Daisy tapped her foot with annoyance and butted in, "Time is limited, Winchell! Who cares whether it's true or not? You have to go!"</p>

  <p>Following his wife's anxious stares, Winchell chuckled and spoke with a faint smile, "Don't worry, Daisy. Although I have a long way to go, five days is enough."</p>

  <p>Goran tilted his head sideways and proceeded, "I'll send Winchell to the Seven-Star Province with the Guiding Sword. It won't take him five days to go to the Seven-Star Province. Three and a half days should be enough!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Daisy felt reassured. She gently smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for the trouble I have caused you, Master Goran. Thank you for your help."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained motionless on his Truth Boat and waited.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, he saw a figure which seemed familiar to him. Dorothy finally returned by her Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>"Dora, how's it going?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled good-naturedly and said in her calm voice, "My uncle has already set out."</p>

  <p>"Uncle?" Luo Zheng quizzed, his eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>Dorothy leaned inward and revealed, "It's my cousin's father. His son got trapped in the whirlpool and got stuck there. I notified them that you could save him, so he hastily set out and might arrive soon."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Save your cousin?" Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dorothy beamed. "I badly need your help. Only you in this world can come to rescue my cousin."</p>

  <p>In reality, Luo Zheng had a bad feeling about taking the candle at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 revealed to him that those candles were valuable and could be beneficial someday, so Luo Zheng planned to retrieve them after finding those whirlpools.</p>

  <p>However, it cautioned him of the dangers in case he took too many. The owners guarded those candles, and he would probably provoke trouble on himself once caught. No. 9527 explained that no help would reach Luo Zheng if it did happen. The forewarning gave him chills, so he dismissed his plan.</p>

  <p>However, he needed to take just another candle away. The idea settled his uneasiness.</p>

  <p>What was more, Dorothy tried to save his life. He had to return this favor.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I offer my hands in service. But, I seek your word to hide this secret about my body going into the Sea of Truth," Luo Zheng begged.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>"If I may add, what's the name of your uncle?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"His name is Winchell Lin," Dorothy stated, her relaxed brow free of frown lines.</p>

  <p>After their brief chat, Luo Zheng departed the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene woke up before Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>As Elgin forced to open his eyes, a look of indignation surfaced on his face as he spoke, "I met the members of the Bearing race. Those fools were swollen with arrogance. They refused to help, and they even taunted me!"</p>

  <p>Before Elgin finished his words, Laura gave a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Bearing race held the reputation as the most influential race in the Source World. They proudly distinguished themselves as the only legitimate descendants of the human race. It seemed impossible to request for their support when needed. Moreover, they settled in a territory too far away, and time was limited.</p>

  <p>Beldene mumbled as he ran his hands through his hair, "In the eyes of the disciples who support those famous sects, the Sword Light Palace is of little significance. They don't give a damn about us at all."</p>

  <p>"Even from the viewpoint of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, we are not especially relevant. Master Qiu Yinhe built our sect but just left behind a Lofty Sword," remarked Ingram.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace needed to prove its worth first to deserve the protection from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. A meager force like them lacked asylum due to its smallness. The ways of the world existed like this for a long time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered as he opened his eyes, slowly adapting to the natural light extending from the sun.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone's eyes gathered on him. Luo Zheng previously stated that it was very likely for him to succeed. His words gave them assurance.</p>

  <p>But before Laura could ask Luo Zheng, she heard a soft, rustling sound coming from outside.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head and blinked rapidly, raising a hand to shield his eyes from the brightness. He saw a few members of the Black Armor race flying back and forth. They scattered snow-white powder into the air, which resulted in steam forming above them.</p>

  <p>"Apparently, they are trying to kill all of us," cried Ingram with a shaky smile, his eyes frozen on the incident in front.</p>

  <p>The powder isolated the nearby areas, so no one had the chance to create a space channel or perform the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>"Even without this impediment, we still won't be able to leave," Laura gasped, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. Ignoring what was happening outside, she looked at Luo Zheng and asked, "How's your talk with your friend?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shared, "Someone's on his way here."</p>

  <p>"Is he a Taiyi Guard?" Laura asked again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tugged on his bottom lip, shaking his head. "I don't know. I only know that his name is Winchell Lin."</p>

  <p>"Lin?"</p>

  <p>After hearing the family name, Laura felt disappointment in her heart.</p>

  <p>She hadn't heard of a Lin Clan in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but when the name Winchell came up, a feeling of strange familiarity enveloped her. A light sparkled from her beautiful big, brown eyes.</p>
