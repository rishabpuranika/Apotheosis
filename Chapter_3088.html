<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3088 Heart Slaughtering Strike </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng used the demonic eye, but he didn't take this opportunity to kill Fergus.</p>

  <p>He just wanted to break the illusion created by the Frigid Sword Prison.</p>

  <p>As Fergus' body stiffened, Zheng found this window of opportunity to strike his enemy, yet he chose not to finish him off.</p>

  <p>Instead, he waited for Fergus to come to his senses.</p>

  <p>After Fergus maneuvered the Flow Strike, the mirage not only affected his opponent but changed himself as well.</p>

  <p>While Fergus functioned like a puppet, he was hardly affected by other things. Still, he couldn't escape the red light in Zheng's eye.</p>

  <p>As soon as Fergus recovered from his immobile state, he quickly discovered that Zheng did not take the opportunity to kill him. He thought he still had a chance!</p>

  <p>Both sides paused in mid-air to inhale quick, shallow breaths that lasted six seconds before the formidable sword of Fergus struck towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his Snow Sword at the same time, and the Ways-blending Energy began to gather again.</p>

  <p>"Six Annihilation Strike!"</p>

  <p>The more layers of Ways-blending Energy merged, the more explosive power it brought. With the Six Annihilation Strike, he actually combined five layers of Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>While he practiced the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, Zheng often sighed with admiration as he regarded Eastern Emperor Taiyi as a real genius.</p>

  <p>If he carried on and just cultivated the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship without going to the Other Shore, he could still fight against the top warriors in the Source World using the Thousand Annihilation Strike. He would be equipped to confront the toughest Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The Snow Sword and the Wild Snow Sword collided again.</p>

  <p>At first, Fergus was overjoyed that Zheng gave him a break.</p>

  <p>However, the second their swords clashed, Fergus' heart quickly sank to the bottom of his stomach.</p>

  <p>It was then he realized that his strength was not on the same level as his adversary's.</p>

  <p>The power Zheng unleashed was not something he could contend with!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A mass of white light that was several times larger than before spread out and once again wrapped the two of them.</p>

  <p>The massive ball of white light covered the wilderness outside of the Dragon City as if it was covered with a thick blanket of snow.</p>

  <p>At the gate of Dragon City, the old man responsible for distributing the flags walked out of his room and looked up at the white light. His dimmed vision became bright under the radiant glow from a distance.</p>

  <p>"He already mastered the Six Annihilation Strike. He did it really fast!" the old man muttered as he walked into the room with his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>The light grew faint and faded away.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw Zheng standing in the air on his own.</p>

  <p>Fergus lay on the ground not far away from him; fractures were seen all over his body. Streams of blood trickled out, and he was in the jaws of death.</p>

  <p>"Latent Theurgy?"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Fergus and flew towards his flag.</p>

  <p>The moment the Six Annihilation Strike exploded, a Latent Theurgy popped out from above Fergus' head, which turned into a layer of solid ice and wrapped around him. This helped him neutralize a considerable amount of energy that Zheng released.</p>

  <p>Since Fergus survived this attack, Zheng decided not to kill him.</p>

  <p>Everyone went silent as the scene unfolded in front of them.</p>

  <p>They were utterly shocked by the final sword attack.</p>

  <p>A few talents resided in Dragon City. Occasionally, these rising new stars would be sent to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But nobody could be as powerful as Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A white light dot streaked through the dusky sky from inside the Dragon City, and night fell.</p>

  <p>When the Alliance Chiefs noticed this white dot of light, they all frowned.</p>

  <p>If one didn't stay within the circle of light released by a flag when nighttime came, even an Alliance Chief would die.</p>

  <p>They could only come down from the sky. Walter inserted his flagpole to the ground to shield the others.</p>

  <p>One of the Alliance Chiefs gently tossed the flag he was holding and placed it in the spot where Fergus was lying.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng spared the life of Fergus, they decided to prevent him from being killed by the raining swords.</p>

  <p>No matter what, the mood of these Alliance Chiefs was complicated.</p>

  <p>Gant puckered his lips in surprise and stared at Zheng as if he were a monster.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Light Palace were full of worship toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Beldene appeared extremely happy. After this battle, no one in or out of the Dragon City would even dare to provoke them!</p>

  <p>They were lucky to be able to join Zheng. It could be imagined that more people would join Zheng in the future.</p>

  <p>On one of the peaks of the Oneness Mountain, a gourd-shaped tower was located on one side of the peak.</p>

  <p>This tower, known as the Flow Tower, was also the core item of the Flow Sword Sect. All those who practiced the Flow Strike had to go through the test of this tower.</p>

  <p>The Flow Tower had a total of 19 floors, and it was not easy for anyone to pass through so many floors.</p>

  <p>It was said that even some five-star Oneness Guards failed to pass through the last floor.</p>

  <p>The door of the thirteenth floor suddenly opened.</p>

  <p>A young man in a coir raincoat flew outside. After floating in the air for a while, he landed on a courtyard at the foot of the tower.</p>

  <p>Within the open area of the court, there stood cyan-stained stone pillars, and a person was locked on each of the pillars.</p>

  <p>The young man looked at them and said in an indifferent tone, "Set them free."</p>

  <p>Tink! Tink! Tink! Tink!</p>

  <p>As a series of mechanical sounds came from the courtyard, the metal chains that restrained these people all broke.</p>

  <p>These people were all powerful warriors in the sixth or seventh stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Some of them had violated the commandments of the Oneness Sky Palace, and several more betrayed the human race by siding with the nonhuman creatures. These warriors were remarkably ferocious and were sentenced to death.</p>

  <p>"As per tradition, if you can kill me, you can leave this damned place. All your past mistakes will be written off," the young man said.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of hope flashed in the eyes of those people who heard this.</p>

  <p>The young man in front was only in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm. There were thirteen of them in total.</p>

  <p>Without courtesy or any pleasant words, these people used their own unique skills and rushed towards the young man.</p>

  <p>But the moment they approached him, the young man suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>On his palm was a cloud of air, as if he carried an invisible sword in his hand. But in fact, there was nothing.</p>

  <p>"Flow Strike, Heart Slaughtering Strike!"</p>

  <p>The young man waved his empty hand gently in the air.</p>

  <p>With different kinds of sounds, the warriors who had not even rushed up to him yet spewed blood from their chests, heads, abdomens, and backs.</p>

  <p>All thirteen people died in an instant.</p>

  <p>The invisible air actually infiltrated directly to their hearts, penetrating their elixir fields and souls.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>On one corner of the courtyard, a girl dressed in an orange garb stood straight, applauding softly with her slender hands.</p>

  <p>"When did you come, Kate? Why didn't you tell me in advance? You could get hurt by accident," the young man smiled when he saw her.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know I'm here?" Kate sniffed, wrinkling her nose.</p>

  <p>The young man chuckled, "You always appear and disappear mysteriously.</p>

  <p>How could I know that?"</p>

  <p>Kate reached out her hand and rubbed the spot between his brows. Then she answered, "The income in the Dragon City has reduced by 50% in the past few months, and it reduced further by 90% in this month."</p>

  <p>"What happened? What did Fergus do?" The young man scowled, the creases on his forehead showing.</p>

  <p>He was in urgent need of divine crystals at this moment, and the income in the Dragon City was his only source of funds. Obviously, he attached great importance to it.</p>
