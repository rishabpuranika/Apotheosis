  <p>After Luo Zheng left, the old man came back to his senses. He looked up at the sky and his eyes were filled with awe.</p>

  <p>"Elder Hu, how did he do that?"</p>

  <p>"He was able to master a Divine Dao in only half a minute. Not even Holy Beings can do that!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it impossible to reach the consummation of the incomplete Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." The old man shook his head, amused. "But now we know one thing: one could also reach the consummation of the incomplete Divine Dao! This means we have to work extra hard to be on the same level."</p>

  <p>The past few decades had been tumultuous for the entire divine land. It went through a drastic change unseen even in the last hundreds of divine eras. But plenty divine citizens and True Gods remained nonchalant. They did not seem to be affected by the changes. Instead, they continued minding their own business and pursuing their own path.</p>

  <p>Up in the bright sky, Luo Xiao could be seen taking Luo Zheng by the hands and teleporting away.</p>

  <p>Together they headed east, towards the direction of the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>The Ray Tree was the highest divine tree in the divine land. It was so tall that one could still distinguish it from several regions away.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had withdrawn from the Floating Island following the death of Nicholas. Despite this, they were still worried. Any moment, Samuel could appear at the Ray Tree, still full of rage.</p>

  <p>So they had put up a lot of measures to protect themselves. For one, they had asked their elite disciples to change names. They were also sent to faraway places. In general, their clan had been staying under the shadows trying not to call any attention to themselves.</p>

  <p>Three days later...</p>

  <p>As they approached the Ray Tree, Luo Zheng suddenly requested a change in direction. Instead, he asked his father to head north.</p>

  <p>Throughout their trip, Luo Zheng had absorbed over a thousand kinds of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>As soon as they stepped into the Heavenly Stellar Region, Luo Xiao's eyes flickered. "It seems that you have an old acquaintance in the Bright Night Region," he announced.</p>

  <p>"An old acquaintance?" Luo Zheng's lips curled into a knowing smile. He knew exactly what his father was talking about. "Which Godly Genius is in the Bright Night Region?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Harold hadn't found all the Godly Geniuses in the divine land. The Godly Geniuses that had gathered at the Immortal Mansion were Xi Youqin, Kurt, Lucille, and Lone.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Xiao's presence made things easier.</p>

  <p>He could easily sense the existence of the Godly Geniuses no matter how far they were from him. After all, they were creatures of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The changes in the Floating Islands prohibited Luo Xiao from taking them back to the Immortal Mansion as soon as he returned. This time, when he took Luo Zheng to absorb the Divine Dao Tablets all over the divine land, he could take the chance to find the rest Godly Geniuses and send them back to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>"It's Nathan," Luo Xiao said flatly.</p>

  <p>"It's him."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had always considered Nathan to be one of his strongest opponents.</p>

  <p>Even before their encounter, he'd been considered as the number one Godly Genius in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Zheng thought of Nathan. He was curious to know as to how he'd been faring in the divide land. He was a talented man and he always stood out. It was unthinkable for him to remain unnoticed by the powerful clans on the Floating Islands all those years.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the internal momentum in the Divine Dao Tablet of the Bright Night Region, Luo Zheng and Luo Xiao had moved to the north of the region.</p>

  <p>The Bai Clan, one of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands occupied the Bright Night Region, but it wasn't their ancestral land. The Bright Night City was such a large divine city that it had a Hundred Commandments Slate to guard it.</p>

  <p>If it was an ordinary first or second tier clan that controlled the large region, Luo Zheng and Luo Xiao would not have any hesitation to take action. Probably they would have directly rushed into the divine city and taken Nathan away.</p>

  <p>Even if they were to trigger the Hundred Commandments Slate, it would be nothing big deal.</p>

  <p>The divine land was vast enough for their visits to those regions to potentially remain unheard of. Even there was a small chance that the news spread out, by the time it would reach the Floating Islands, Luo Zheng might have already absorbed all the internal momentum of the three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, they would try their best to avoid attracting any attention when they visited the regions that belonged to the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. The Bai Clan was a powerful clan. If they were alerted by their presence, the news would easily spread to the Floating Island of the Bai Clan.</p>

  <p>Upon landing at the entrance of the divine city, the two made sure to hide their auras. They paid the required divine might coins as they entered the Bright Night City.</p>

  <p>Right in the middle of the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, a pile of divine might coins stood like a small hill.</p>

  <p>Alfredo wore dozens of space rings on his fingers.</p>

  <p>These space rings all could hold a lot of things, and over a dozen of these space rings were now filled with divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, news got out that Leyton killed Gibson with only one swift strike, and all the powerful clans on the Floating Islands submitted to Samuel.</p>

  <p>The rankings of the powerful clans were determined by the Arena of Legends. Although the rankings didn't change, the Han Clan was now the most powerful and had the most control over all the Floating Islands. Thus, all the powerful clans submitted themselves to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>This was something that Nicholas hadn't even achieved in the past!</p>

  <p>Alfredo was the master of the Han Clan. The rise of the power of the Han Clan also made him the master of all the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. This placed him on a pedestal and earned him a lot of respect.</p>

  <p>Alfredo felt a thrill inside him. He couldn't imagine Holy Beings bowing their heads at his mercy, when he was only a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Samuel found a quiet spot to cultivate in seclusion. He left Alfredo to collect the divine might coins alone.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Alfredo was a little nervous.</p>

  <p>Despite the excitement it gave him, he knew it wouldn't be easy to make the Holy Beings hand over the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>All these years, the powerful clans had been pushing the disciples of the clans to go to the forbidden lands. This way, they would be able to train while collecting the divine might coins hidden in these areas.</p>

  <p>There was a lot of power play on the Floating Islands. Everyone was trying to make or change the rule. It was important for every powerful clan to have rules on the Ruling Slate that worked to their own clan's advantage.</p>

  <p>An exorbitant amount of divine might coins might allow one to change the rules. Unfortunately, most powerful clans did not have such a large amount.</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas could only do so little with the rules. He couldn't afford to make any significant changes, which would cost him enormous amount of divine might coins.</p>

  <p>It would only be possible if all powerful clans were willing to cooperate and gather all their divine might coins together. That way, they could collect enough to make an extremely powerful rule.</p>

  <p>Alfredo also felt that something strange was up. Who were the Yellow Emperor Guards and Samuel dealing with to require such a powerful rule?</p>

  <p>It was rumored that even the Other Shore Realm master in the Sword Clan who created the Non-combat Zone had been killed. Who was powerful enough to stand up against the Han Clan in the entire divine land now?</p>

  <p>Though confused, Alfredo always took it seriously to accomplish every task given to him by Samuel.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a consummate True God from the Liu Clan jumped off to the edge of the square and activated his space ring. As a result, black divine might coins poured out of the ring like water spilling over and piled up into a small hill on the ground.</p>

  <p>The consummate True God and Alfredo exchanged glances. Then, the True God snorted and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>Alfredo ran after him and blocked his path. "Leander, do you have any complaints you want to air out on behalf of the Liu Clan?"</p>

  <p>Leander Liu's expression changed immediately as he thought of all the rumors he heard these days. His sneer turned into a polite smile. "No," he said with a low voice. "We don't have any complaints."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to hear that," Alfredo responded with a nod.</p>

  <p>With a huge sigh, Leander Liu left hurriedly.</p>

  <p>The powerful clans held a lot of grudges against the Han Clan, but they were all too powerless compared to them. Most of them resorted to doing nothing.</p>

  <p>Thus, the popularity of the powerful clans had decreased significantly. All the disciples of the powerful clans, together with the Holy Beings of the clans were like fish on the chopping block.</p>
