<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was thoroughly alarmed the moment the Evil God had succeeded in completely blending the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The power within the diamond-shaped energy greatly exceeded the expectations of the Evil God. It was also way beyond Zheng could have ever imagined.</p>

  <p>As the diamond-shaped energy exploded, it released a huge amount of energy that transcended ten thousand divine megatons of force. Without a doubt, Zheng thought he probably wouldn't have been able to withstand this extreme amount of force if it had happened outside his inner world.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, this didn't pose much of a problem inside Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Here, he was an omnipotent being. He was the absolute ruler of this place and his power was unparalleled. Therefore, he could easily restore everything in their original forms.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had intended this enormous amount of energy to explode completely. He wanted to observe and ascertain its full might.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng halted his experiment midway. He was annoyed and frowned at the sudden interruption.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have to raise his head and look at the Evil God for he knew that there was a change in his emotions. He felt the annoyance and bitterness the Evil God felt. "I'm afraid this huge amount of power would obliterate more than half of my inner world if it completely explodes. You have to understand why I stopped it," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that it? So you also have something to be afraid of, huh?" The Evil God sneered at Zheng's remark. He still couldn't keep the annoyance out of his tone.</p>

  <p>Zheng held the diamond-shaped energy on his palm as he slowly flew over to where the Evil God was. "Well theoretically, there shouldn't be anything that could make me afraid in my own inner world. However, your presence is an exception."</p>

  <p>Essentially, the creation of the Evil God took up some of Zheng's best talents.</p>

  <p>There were always pros and cons to his existence. If the Evil God stayed inside Zheng's inner world, then as a primitive land, it would go through many tribulations. These ordeals also served as great trials for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng hovered in front of the golden fence and handed the diamond-shaped energy to the Evil God. "You did a great job." He faced the Evil God and praised him sincerely. He had to admit that he was impressed at this display of power.</p>

  <p>"It didn't do me any good, though, did it?" The Evil God seemed dejected as he scowled at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it did. For that, I will give you a handsome reward," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Evil God wasn't surprised by Zheng's words. He also didn't seem interested in it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once set the Evil God free after he helped him blend the many Godly Ways. However, he believed that Zheng wouldn't make the mistake of doing that again after his open betrayal of him. He desired nothing else but his freedom. Therefore, he showed absolutely no interest in Zheng's so-called reward.</p>

  <p>"Would you kindly repeat the process of blending the Godly Ways to me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked courteously.</p>

  <p>From inside the fence, the Evil God merely glanced sideways at Zheng as he disintegrated the diamond-shaped energy in his hand. He couldn't be bothered to repeat the whole process in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"My dear, the Creator himself demands this from you. So please, just do it again," coaxed Edna who was standing behind the Evil God. She never thought it was a wise move to go against the will of their creator.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't really need me to do it again. He is able to get the knowledge by himself," retorted the Evil God coldly.</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth curled into a smile. He reached out in front of him and clenched his fist. A long sword instantly appeared in his hand. He conjured it out of thin air.</p>

  <p>Normally, a sword created in such a casual way was fragile and of poor quality. However, this was Zheng's inner world. Therefore, he was able to improve and enhance it to the highest level with just a single thought.</p>

  <p>He remained motionless with the sword in his hand for a short time. Several visions playing one after another flashed in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's mind, the scene of the Evil God blending the Godly Ways began to unfold. Impressively, it didn't leave out any details at all!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy began to gather around the long sword in Zheng's hand. Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine kinds of internal momentum assembled first. These were followed by the Thunderstorm Godly Way and the Blood Essence Godly Way. The arc light energy came in last!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After Zheng blended them in order, he encountered the same accident that the Evil God had experienced a while ago. There were more than thirty kinds of internal momentum of the Godly Ways that automatically split from the others.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already observed this odd occurrence so he was well prepared for it. With a flick of his hand, these more than thirty Godly Ways formed into a mass of energy and merged into the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>There was a flash of purple light that emanated from it. This signaled that Zheng was successful in blending all of them together.</p>

  <p>As Zheng held the sword in his hand, he said, "I don't have any spare time to cultivate the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. Fortunately, it is much similar to the diamond-shaped energy you have created. Therefore, I can just learn from your experience of creating this energy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had to admit that he was a bit envious of the Evil God's sheer talent of blending the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was able to create this method almost instinctively. Even though the diamond-shaped energy he created was not a specific skill, it still had a much greater stability and comprehensibility than the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship written by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>It was extremely noteworthy that it took Eastern Emperor Taiyi a lot of time and energy to complete the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. This was regarded far and wide as a supreme swordsmanship manual. Compared to that, it was only a short span of time from when the Evil God had first grasped the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>It was true that there were times when Zheng had felt the urge to devour the Evil God and take his talent as his own. However, he would immediately pull himself together as he thought of the Regal Jade Spirit's warning.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there was a clanging sound.</p>

  <p>Three gleams of purple sword radiance merged together. Zheng summoned them according to the methods of the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. But during the course of it, Zheng made some changes and turned the sword radiance into diamond-shaped energy. He used the method he had just learned from the Evil God while he blended them.</p>

  <p>When Zheng returned the Evil God to his inner world, he gathered all of the Evil God's Other Shore Tokens and everything else that belonged to him.</p>

  <p>These included his memories and experiences as well.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not pry into the Evil God's memories out of respect. He only acquired his knowledge of blending the diamond-shaped energy.</p>

  <p>Ten layers...</p>

  <p>Fifty layers...</p>

  <p>One hundred...</p>

  <p>One hundred and ninety...</p>

  <p>As the number of the energy layers gathering on the sword increased, the Ways-blending Energy also became increasingly formidable.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Ways-blending Energy on the long sword became so intimidating that even the Evil God gasped in astonishment. "This energy will be unbelievably powerful when used in swordsmanship," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi is one of the most powerful masters in the Source World. His strength is comparable to that of the Black Ship's captain. It can be expected that the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship he wrote has its merits. If you are interested to read it, I can get it for you," offered Zheng.</p>

  <p>As mentioned before, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was regarded as a supreme swordsmanship manual. Therefore, it was not allowed to be handed down to outsiders. However, Zheng could lend it to the Evil God if he wanted.</p>

  <p>As he finished saying this, Zheng suddenly raised his hand that held the sword.</p>

  <p>The sword slashed and pierced the air at the distance. The purple sword radiance contained almost twenty thousand divine megatons of force. As it erupted forth, the space in its path was shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>But before the sword radiance had completely exploded, Zheng created a huge black rift in space using his mind. It appeared in front of the sword radiance and swallowed it whole.</p>

  <p>He could not allow the sword radiance to explode inside his inner world. It was powerful enough to obliterate the entirety of this world.</p>

  <p>"What's the point of learning this swordsmanship if I cannot leave your inner world? It will only be a waste of time and talent." The Evil God hung his head and replied sourly.</p>

  <p>Zheng fixed his gaze at the Evil God. "Well, I agree. It will be such an awful waste to keep you imprisoned inside my inner world."</p>

  <p>As he heard these words, the Evil God instantly raised his head. He stared confusedly at Zheng and wondered whether he was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out his hand toward the Evil God and offered him a handful of Chaotic Source Spirits. Then, he said, "Here's two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits. These will be enough for you to reach the Chaotic Source Realm."</p>

  <p>The Evil God was fully aware of the Chaotic Source Spirit's absolute importance because he had once been sent into the Chaotic Source World by the Black Ship. However, he had given up hope of ever reaching the Chaotic Source Realm after his rebellion against Zheng failed. Never in his wildest dreams had he expected that Zheng would freely hand him such a gift.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that the Evil God would plainly refuse any other kind of reward.</p>

  <p>However, if he offered him Chaotic Source Spirits...</p>

  <p>The Evil God took them from Zheng without any second thoughts.</p>
