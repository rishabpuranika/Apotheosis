  <p>
</p>

  <p>An expression of surprise flashed across the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face, "You have already made it?"</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a light shadow appeared on the wall again. The figure formed by the light shadow seemed to be a complex, futuristic craft.</p>

  <p>"Although the size of our members is already small, we are still not small enough." The green figure continued to explain, "After we had processed the sand, we were able to display a stronger calculation ability. However, it took us more than half of the chaotic era to obtain this method..."</p>

  <p>The complicated craft slowly morphed into black boxes, quite similar to the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's Civilization Artifact that Luo Zheng had fused with.</p>

  <p>"Such a powerful thing is actually made of sand..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the green figure was not concerned with the Primeval Lord of Heaven's exclamation. It knew that their Calculation Civilization was such a unique existence.</p>

  <p>While the form on the wall transformed, a world of ice and snow appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>"This is the Blooming Jade Stage," Li Bianxue finally voiced out.</p>

  <p>She knew what she was talking about, especially because she had passed through the Blooming Jade Stage just now.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the green figure responded. "If you came from the upper ice field, you would have noticed the light dots distributed in the Cold Prisons."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement. "That must be from the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>The scene on the wall quickly switched to a Cold Prison, and then the black boxes reappeared. As the green light on the boxes flashed, an illusory outline formed and glowed with green as well.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the light spots in the Cold Prison were confirmed by the extremely high-speed calculation.</p>

  <p>It was during the presenting process of the wall picture that the green figure murmured words about the calculation. These most probably would have to be the unique words of the Calculation Civilization.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not decipher those words, they assumed the Calculation Civilization had the ability to restore the things in the Abstruse Energy World by means of quick calculations.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a deformed, odd monster curled up in the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>It was imprisoned in the Cold Prison, but was not dead. The picture showed its eyes that blinked a couple times.</p>

  <p>"The monster is still alive?" Phoenix gasped.</p>

  <p>A trace of fear rose in her heart when she thought of the Cold Prisons she had passed by just now.</p>

  <p>"Yes, most of them are alive. Only a few died," the green figure acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Do the monsters in the Cold Prisons belong to the Instant Civilization?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The green figure heaved out a huge sigh. Like most human beings and other ambitious civilizations, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was on the hunt for the Instant Civilization and the meaning of its existence.</p>

  <p>"Since you can see through the world outside the chaos, why haven't you discovered the real way to complete the Finale Way?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued to ask.</p>

  <p>"It's not like we haven't tried! We have considered many methods, including using powerful Other Shore Tokens," the green figure replied.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard about the Other Shore Tokens, his eyes lit up. "We human beings have collected the Other Shore Tokens within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, such as..."</p>

  <p>The green figure listened intently as the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. When he finished, the green figure couldn't help but smile. "You must have failed, right?"</p>

  <p>"They did. If they had succeeded, we wouldn't even be here right now,"</p>

  <p>Phoenix spat.</p>

  <p>The green figure shook its head. "I didn't draw the conclusion through this.</p>

  <p>It is because we have calculated the power needed to put up against that needle."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven scoffed, "You figured out how much strength is needed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." The green figure continued, "Around one hundred and sixty-one million Jun..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Li Bianxue, Phoenix and the Primeval Lord of Heaven took a deep breath after they heard this answer.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Luo Zheng only had the power of tens of thousands of Jun as of the moment.</p>

  <p>Plus, if the power of hundreds of thousands of Jun was released, that would be terrifying to be around.</p>

  <p>Considering the amount of power needed, there was no way they could succeed and make it out alive.</p>

  <p>There was no telling what such a formidable force could do.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven expressed, shaking his head. "In the past, when the human ancestor used his strongest method, he sacrificed himself by releasing over nine million Jun of force.</p>

  <p>He almost succeeded in completing the Finale Way..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was inclined to believe his words.</p>

  <p>When he saw King Manard and the human race on the Other Shore, he had learned that the human race had almost completed the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Over nine million Jun of force was already so threatening, but it was nowhere near the power of one hundred and sixty-one million Jun.</p>

  <p>However, the green figure couldn't care less about the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction. "We've collected much information regarding Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Taking into account of all the existing Other Shore Tokens, we calculated the greatest possible power we could obtain, which is nine million seven hundred and thirty thousand Jun.</p>

  <p>I wonder if your ancestor used the same amount of power."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was stunned to hear this, and his eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>Previously, when they saw that the Calculation Civilization consisted of a bunch of insects, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Luo Zheng looked down upon them. After all, what could a bunch of tiny insects do?</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that the Primeval Lord of Heaven believed these insects developed a powerful civilization on their own.</p>

  <p>They calculated anything correctly.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven recalled that before the human ancestor sacrificed himself, his voice echoed throughout the entire starry region.</p>

  <p>"Today, I will do my best to complete this. With the burning of all these tokens, I will unleash the terrifying power of nine million seven hundred and thirty thousand Jun..."</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization had never obtained these Other Shore Tokens before, but they could calculate the amount of power so accurately. The Primeval Lord of Heaven could not believe that.</p>

  <p>"The things left behind on the Other Shore seem mysterious, but they prove to be mere illusory traps which lure rounds of civilizations into them. They all assume that they could complete the Finale Way," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>"But no matter what you do, even your most perfect plan won't get you through the Finale Way."</p>

  <p>Convinced, the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded at the green figure with great reverence. However, his eyes gleamed with an ounce of hope, "So what method can be used to complete the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>"The Energy Shaft," the figure responded. "Only the Energy Shaft can transform endless power."</p>

  <p>In the past, when the Calculation Civilization discovered they couldn't complete the Finale Way relying on the Other Shore, they came up with different methods to do so. So far, the Energy Shaft was the most promising one.</p>
