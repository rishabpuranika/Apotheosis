<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1703 Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng had no way of dodging the incoming punch.</p>

  <p>But he remained calm.</p>

  <p>Although these 'Zhengs' looked extremely real and retained all of his characteristics, in the end, they were still just physical bodies.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical body was strong, his strength bordering on tyrannical, but it still relied on the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Would that woman be able to duplicate the Genuine Dragons and Divine Flame Cauldron?</p>

  <p>It wasn't highly possible despite looking like it was.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Life Law was powerful, but people couldn't duplicate everything in the world. They could only create things related to life.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly launched a counterattack against the punch.</p>

  <p>The clone had obviously obeyed Shania's command. And in that instant, all the forceful energy within his body erupted in a great rush. He hadn't borrowed strength from the dragon scales, but the explosive power was still astonishing.</p>

  <p>But it showed quite clearly that the clone and the real Zheng were not on the same level.</p>

  <p>Zheng gasped.</p>

  <p>He had underestimated 'himself'.</p>

  <p>The 'Zheng' that Shania had created might not be as strong as Zheng after all.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean they weren't the living 'Zheng'.</p>

  <p>When the punch was thrown, the clone use the Eight Smoky Melodies again and circled around his wrist. He dodged the punch within a distance of three inches.</p>

  <p>Soon, a faint halo of light enveloped Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thunderbolt Annihilation!" the clone shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng froze.</p>

  <p>Mysterious law began to appear in the sky. The brewing of the Heavenly Tribulation!</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was familiar with the power of the Thunderbolt Annihilation, took a step forward and before anyone could react, passed through space and escaped.</p>

  <p>But the moment he charged out of the circle of light, another circle of light appeared beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Ten clones of himself were standing opposite him.</p>

  <p>The Thunderbolt Annihilation the clone Zhengs had simultaneously unleashed had surrounded Zheng on all sides.</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts of the Heavenly Tribulation had crashed down before Zheng could get out of the range of the Thunderbolt Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The descent of the Thunderbolt Annihilation had been shocking enough.</p>

  <p>But when ten Thunderbolt Annihilations came crashing down at the same time, it felt like the Heaven Earth Board was filled with lightning and thunderbolts.</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts had covered Zheng's body, making it impossible to determine where he was.</p>

  <p>Shania's face contorted when she saw the power of the Thunderbolt Annihilation.</p>

  <p>It was true that she had created these clones, but they were living people after all. She could not control them like puppets, and could only give them certain instructions.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected them to unleash such power.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before the thunderbolts slowly dissipated.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still standing at the center of the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked terrible. His body was charred and even if it was powerful, it wouldn't be any good once struck by so many thunderbolts.</p>

  <p>The clones looked like they were planning on joining forces to use the Thunderbolt Annihilation again.</p>

  <p>"You're going to launch it again?" Zheng murmured disbelievingly. Zheng's gaze focused as he took a step forward, traveling through space for a distance and appearing before one of them in almost no time at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng had cast out Eight Smoky Melodies at the same time.</p>

  <p>If the both of them activated the Eight Smoky Melodies at the same time, they would cancel each other out. This was because Zheng himself had no weight, and his opponent couldn't rely on the Eight Smoky Melodies to dodge his attack.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The first clone was caught off-guard by Zheng's punch and went flying.</p>

  <p>His body swayed with the power of his own punch. He dodged another clone's attack and punched at him again.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure strength, Zheng had almost completely defeated the ten clones in front of him.</p>

  <p>These clones were like sandbags as they were thrown in all directions by Zheng's punches.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the battle had become clear in just a few moments.</p>

  <p>"I hate this kind of battle," Zheng said as he brandished his sword and shook his other fist. "But I have to say, these puppets of yours are too weak."</p>

  <p>This surprised Shania.</p>

  <p>"Your power is not yours."</p>

  <p>Although Shania had created ten Zhengs, they were still not her puppets and she could not control them. And the clones could not use the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked indifferent, as if he was not going to answer this question.</p>

  <p>Instead, he said, "Since your performance has come to an end, let me help you out."</p>

  <p>Saying this, he jumped into the air. Threads of sword intent began to condense on his sword.</p>

  <p>The sword intent was faint, an earthy yellow luster reflecting off of it as it stretched back and forth on the blade of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng had outdone himself this time, having drained more than 10% of the chaotic energy in his body.</p>

  <p>Half of it had been converted into sword intent and was being compressed on the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, as if on a loop.</p>

  <p>The other half of the chaotic energy had turned into Metal Law. It then combined the metal elements into one and fused it into the sword intent.</p>

  <p>This could be seen as an improved version of Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>It was also a move that Zheng had learned to use while he had fought Lone.</p>

  <p>His sword attack was complete once the two energies had condensed.</p>

  <p>Zheng had, by doing this, created a new technique that brought the Metal Law and the chaotic energy together.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Metal Law had become diamonds embedded in the sword intent, and at the center of the diamonds was a form of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>A new world seemed to open up in Zheng's field of vision now that he was inspired by Lone.</p>

  <p>Zheng's accumulated power hadn't yet been unleashed but the entire world seemed to be frightened.</p>

  <p>The vitality between heaven and earth in this picture was abundant, but Zheng's sword force had thrown it into disorder.</p>

  <p>"This sword attack is called the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!" Zheng said.</p>

  <p>But Shania made her move just as Zheng was gathering his power.</p>

  <p>The ten clones retreated and moved to stand in front of Shania, who waved her hand, causing ten long swords to fly to the clones.</p>

  <p>"Your greatest accomplishment is still of the sword. Then they will be exactly the same as you," Shania said.</p>

  <p>The clones didn't even look back as they easily caught the swords thrown to them by reaching behind their backs with their right hands.</p>

  <p>All these swords were ordinary divine weapons. Most were at the third rank while the rest were at the second rank. Only two of them were first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>However, the quality of the sword did not matter. The key was the person who used the sword.</p>

  <p>The clones that were wielding the sword also entered a state of emotion closing.</p>

  <p>They were also using the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>But there were ten of them.</p>

  <p>If these ten clones were to launch the Gods-intimidating Strike simultaneously, it would be fatal to the person at the receiving end because of how unimaginably great the power contained within it was.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't hesitate.</p>

  <p>He slashed out with his sword.</p>

  <p>The gold and the gray lights spread along with the sword intent. The three of them fused together into a strange golden light. Like the setting sun, the light spread out from his sword and covered the entirety of the Heaven Earth Board with a faint golden afterglow.</p>

  <p>It also covered the Godly Geniuses and the clouds in the sky with a layer of golden powder.</p>

  <p>Even Shania looked around cautiously.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's opponent was ten of himself. What was more, he would be attacked by his strongest sword strike.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike that Zheng had created was not inferior to anyone or anything in the slightest. The radiance emitted by his sword seemed to be capable of shaking the entire world.</p>
