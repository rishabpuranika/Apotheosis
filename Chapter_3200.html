  <p>
</p>

  <p>Warriors from the Su City and Xu City gradually felt the gravity of the situation. Horror filled their minds.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan was the weakest among all clans around the Clear Lake. They only majored in weapon refining, which had no high requirement in terms of cultivation base.</p>

  <p>But the heads of the Xu Clan, Li Clan, Zhao Clan and others were all at the peak of Lust World. Some of them had even crossed the Lust World and reached the threshold of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>They knew exactly how powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were! The realm was the first limit that many of them would physically encounter.</p>

  <p>Lazlo was a mere half-step from the Chaotic Source Realm, while Drystan was also close to the realm.</p>

  <p>But just within a few minutes, Luo Zheng had killed both of them.</p>

  <p>This was an unthinkable turn of events for many of them.</p>

  <p>The head of the Xu Clan was at first motivated to stop Luo Zheng. He was even willing to kill him if he had to.</p>

  <p>But this motivation was replaced by fear as soon as he saw Drystan get killed. He halted in mid-air and slowly backed away from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew he was no match for Luo Zheng, but he also knew that he shouldn't just let Marco die at the hands of Luo Zheng. He was in a dilemma: should he try to counter Luo Zheng's attacks or flee to safety?</p>

  <p>As soon as he killed Drystan, Luo Zheng no longer had any hesitation in him.</p>

  <p>He flew swiftly like a big hawk and went straight to Marco.</p>

  <p>Marco only had Grayson for a guard.</p>

  <p>And Grayson was the weakest among the three.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that he had his Other Shore Token, the Spying Mirror, with him. With it, he was able to detect his opponents in secret.</p>

  <p>"You brat! I'll fight you to death!"</p>

  <p>Grayson's eyes opened wide with fury. A small mirror appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>A beam of radiance shot out of the mirror's surface. It went straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to dodge it at the last second. He focused on reaching Grayson all while avoiding the light. The long sword in his hand left a long trail in the air.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't even be bothered to use the Sword Texture Technique as well as the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>Instead, a silver light beamed in the air and pierced right through Grayson.</p>

  <p>It sliced him from top to bottom and cut him in half. Finally, the all of the three were gone.</p>

  <p>With Grayson out of the way, Luo Zheng and Marco were finally looking at each other eye to eye.</p>

  <p>Marco was still lying on the waters, protected by the diamond-shaped light curtain. Above him hovered Luo Zheng, gazing at him coldly.</p>

  <p>Just a few moments earlier, Luo Zheng launched an all-out attack. Marco ended up badly injured, with only the light curtain to protect him. The Latent token had saved his life once, but it wasn't going to save him each time.</p>

  <p>With Lazlo, Drystan, and Grayson dead, he no longer had anyone that could save him from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Marco's eyes filled with fear as Luo Zheng loomed overhead. He stared at Luo Zheng with his remaining energy and, with a trembling voice, declared, "You can't kill me!"</p>

  <p>"You tried to kill me more than once!" Luo Zheng said with gaze so piercing it would make anyone shiver.</p>

  <p>"But I failed every time! You survived!" Marco retorted desperately.</p>

  <p>"I survived?" Luo Zheng laughed. A mocking smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The moment of their first encounter in the temple, Marco had already attempted to kill Luo Zheng. During their second encounter at the Seven Mountains Meeting, Marco barely held himself back. The third time, he rushed into the Heart Flow Sect to challenge Luo Zheng. Now, they were face to face once more.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng let him go, there would be no assurance that Marco would give up.</p>

  <p>"If you kill me now, you will regret it! People of the Vastness Mountain will not let you off, neither will my father!" Marco resorted to using his status and identity as a way out. He knew begging Luo Zheng and enticing pity out of him was useless.</p>

  <p>He knew that no ordinary disciple of the Heart Flow Sect would dare offend the Vastness Mountain, one of the seven mountains in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the head of the Xu Clan and Cailen arrived. "Young man, I implore you to think about what you're about to do," the head of the Xu Clan persuaded. "His death would cause the entire Taiyi Heaven Palace to go into chaos. There will be no place for you in the palace!"</p>

  <p>He turned to wink at Cailen.</p>

  <p>Cailen had never intended to get involved in this matter at all, but he wanted to maintain their clan's close relationship with the Xu Clan, and the Xu Clan had asked for his intervention.</p>

  <p>Cailen also agreed that Luo Zheng should not kill Marco.</p>

  <p>Unlike these declining clans around the Clear Lake, the Vastness Mountain was a great power that Luo Zheng couldn't afford to offend.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, they're right. Please think twice before you kill a direct descendant of the Vastness Mountain," Cailen pointed out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at them both. "So what do I do? Not fight back and pretend he hasn't repeatedly attempted to kill me? Are we going to allow this power play just because I was born inferior?"</p>

  <p>"But..." the head of the Xu Clan stammered through a response. He knew Luo Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>"He's not the first of his kind to have given me threats, nor will he be the last," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned towards Marco and swung his sword at him.</p>

  <p>The light curtain created by the Latent token was about to collapse. Luo Zheng's attack weakened the shield and cut Marco's head.</p>

  <p>Marco opened his mouth to plead more, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>His dead body fell and floated into the water.</p>

  <p>"Oh no. This is going to be a serious trouble for all of us!" the head of the Xu Clan exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Marco's presence was a big honor to their clan, but now he was killed before his own eyes. How was he going to explain to the Vastness Mountain?</p>

  <p>Cailen's eyelids widened. Anxiety filled his heart. He knew that what Luo Zheng did was impulsive and reckless, but at the back of his mind he felt deep admiration. Luo Zheng had once more proven how extraordinary he was. If he continued growing, he would end up as a legendary figure.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Many warriors of Xu Clan who witnessed the murder flew into the air to approach Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not everyone was well-aware of what was truly happening. All they cared about was that Marco was a member of the Xu Clan. They would not allow Luo Zheng to escape their sight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was strong, but the members of the Xu Clan outnumbered him. They were confident they'd win against a single person.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and placed his long sword horizontally across his chest. "Anyone who stands in my way will die," he warned.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a white light flashed across his right eye.</p>

  <p>The warriors floating above the Clear Lake felt shivers go down their spines. With fearful gazes, they stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let him go," said the head of the Xu Clan in an exhausted voice.</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng could easily escape their hands. He didn't want to risk any more lives just to stop him from leaving.</p>

  <p>He wanted to act smarter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned to the Su Clan's crowd. The blank faces of Ruben, Reid, and all the others welcomed him.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan knew they were in big trouble if they were to be implicated.</p>

  <p>Only Gant stepped forward with a look of admiration on his face. "Flag Master, you truly are formidable!" he praised.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng patted his shoulder. "I killed Marco. Aren't you afraid of being implicated?"</p>

  <p>Cailen and all the others were cursing Gant in their minds. All they wanted was to disassociate from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of being implicated?" Gant raised his brows. "There must be several thousand direct descendants in the seven mountains, but there are only a dozen of disciples capable of Instant Enlightenment as you are. I highly doubt they'd do anything against you, Flag Master!"</p>
