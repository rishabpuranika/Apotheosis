<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1755 The Information In The Blood </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"He's surprisingly able to bear the pain," a Supreme Lord said. His cold yet slightly impressed voice echoed against the walls.</p>

  <p>Their eyes gravitated towards Luo Zheng's thick meridians, and they were sure that the Sky Origin Blood still raged fiercely within his body. Luo Luo Zheng on the other hand had no choice but to endure it.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for his inhumane physical strength, he would've exploded by now.</p>

  <p>"He'll need at least a few days if he wants to keep the Sky Origin Blood for his own use. Let's see how he endures it," chimed another voice.</p>

  <p>Right after the words died down, Luo Zheng's eyes shot open. His face had been ghostly pale a few moments ago, but it had now returned to its normal state. He even gave everyone present a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The warm current in his body, also known as the primordial energy wrapped around his meridians and continued to resist the Sky Origin Blood's erratic energy.</p>

  <p>Although the immense force didn't disappear, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to suppress it.</p>

  <p>It meant that even if Luo Luo Zheng looked terrifying at that moment, he was actually no different from a normal person since the energy in his body had reached a balance.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" everyone around him exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords gawked at Luo Luo Zheng as if he was a monster, completely at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, the Celestial Position had changed several people's blood. Four of the top ten warriors in the Illusion Battlefield had changed their blood into the Earth Origin Blood, which was different from Luo Zheng's. To them, it felt like a walk into the jaws of death.</p>

  <p>In reality, Luo Luo Zheng was able to move. He didn't really need to bear the pain at all, but he had to remain in his position and absorb the Sky Origin Blood first just to be safe.</p>

  <p>After what seemed like ages, the Sky Origin Blood finally subsided. It was as if a berserk beast had exhausted all its energy within Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The snake-like meridians around his limbs calmed down and shrunk as well.</p>

  <p>At last, Luo Luo Zheng had changed his blood into the Sky Origin Blood.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he felt his entire body was filled to the brim with a unique power.</p>

  <p>The power was completely different from the dragon scales'. He had borrowed the power of the dragon scales in many fights, but the power in the Sky Origin Blood belonged to him. Thus, he could control the latter more freely.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Luo Zheng still hadn't realized how precious the Sky Origin Blood was to the Celestial Position even until now.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for the extremely dangerous disaster in the universe, the Celestial Position couldn't have taken out the Sky Origin Blood. Even their leader didn't have the rights to use it by force.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Zheng's ears were greeted by heated arguments between the Supreme Lords the moment he entered the place.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Master Feng ordered for Luo Luo Zheng to be taken somewhere to rest.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had left, the seniors of the Celestial Position looked rather calm and normal, but there seemed to be a wicked glint in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The voice belonged to Supreme Lord Silas. He was the second strongest powerhouse of the Celestial Position, second only to Master Feng. He could be considered a mid-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Master Feng shook his head and said, "I can't tell for the time being.</p>

  <p>Although we've succeeded in changing his blood, the Sky Origin Blood is not to be trifled with. I'll have to observe for a few days before I can tell."</p>

  <p>"I really hope that these young fellows can grow quickly," Supreme Lord Silas said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>The other masters nodded in agreement. They had already felt the footsteps in the darkness get closer and closer.</p>

  <p>In fact, a lot of things had recently happened in the universe.</p>

  <p>A few of the weaker races disappeared overnight. A fissure appeared somewhere faraway in the universe. Eight world lords of the Humanity Alliance had died without reason.</p>

  <p>While those events weren't a big deal in the universe, they hid some clues.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position had joined forces with the Thoughtless Minds and other great powers to quickly lay out their plans, in hopes to gain more time. Yet based on the information from the previous grand era, they wouldn't have high chances of victory if they only relied on their strength.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng was brought to a large mountain. He and Freya saw rows and rows of exquisite buildings as they slid down the rocky slope.</p>

  <p>Just as he had landed, he met Tianming once again.</p>

  <p>"Why is he here as well?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as his eyes tried to focus when he saw Nathan who stood on top of a large rock, dressed in white as his eyes stared off into the distance.</p>

  <p>Nathan felt Luo Zheng's stare. Then he looked back and glared at him in return.</p>

  <p>Clearly, Nathan still held a grudge towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng remained indifferent. He didn't have a good impression of Nathan and besides, the guy wasn't a nice person anyway.</p>

  <p>Then, he saw his many other acquaintances including Kurt, Lawson, and Lucille.</p>

  <p>They also saw Luo Luo Zheng, and came up to greet him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng originally thought that after the Illusion Battlefield had ended, they would all go on their separate ways for new cultivation. However, they were all gathered here. Could it be that they had all changed their blood?</p>

  <p>It was possible. According to what the cyan dragon said before, those who had their blood changed could conceal themselves to prevent others from finding them. The Celestial Position, Thoughtless Minds, and other powers had joined forces to complete the arrangements, so that the top ten warriors of the Illusion Battlefield would inevitably have to change their blood.</p>

  <p>It was then that Luo Luo Zheng realized that he didn't know much about things, so he could only deduce from clues he had obtained.</p>

  <p>But since these people were gathered in the same place, the Celestial Position must've had their own plans. It could possibly be related to the universe's impending crisis.</p>

  <p>"Why don't I see Mu Ning?" Luo Luo Zheng asked Tianming. In turn, his friend simply shrugged.</p>

  <p>"She's still on the way. Aside from Shania, the other nine must all be here," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just nodded. He would eventually find out along the way, regardless of the Celestial Position's motives. However, he noticed that Tianming's gaze was transfixed on Freya, but with a hint of hostility.</p>

  <p>He then remembered what happened after he got drunk. He was curious, so he brought it up.</p>

  <p>Freya who stood beside him balled her hands into fists. She tried to keep calm, but her nervousness betrayed her. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng would mention it sooner or later, but she didn't expect for it to be so fast.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming simply smiled and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, you were drunk. You must've misheard."</p>

  <p>"Oh really?" Luo Luo Zheng said as his eyebrows creased.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't sure either, so he could only hope to keep it out of his mind.</p>

  <p>In reality, Luo Luo Zheng didn't actually know what Tianming was up to even until now. His friend who used to never lie to others, now hid so many things from him. Tianming had more secrets than half of what he said last time, which made Luo Luo Zheng feel that he was becoming increasingly mysterious.</p>

  <p>The Sky Origin Blood had undergone some subtle changes in Luo Zheng's body recently. Aside from the strong power, there was also something else lurking within the blood.</p>

  <p>Some races, such as the Genuine Dragon and the Genuine Phoenix hid important information within their blood. Then, the information within their blood would be passed onto the next generation when they had grown up.</p>
