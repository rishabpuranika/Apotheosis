<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The dreary battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race had finally come to an end. Since the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi showed up, the remaining members of the Bearing race were either captured or killed in the battle.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the Sun Crow race didn't suffer a heavy loss. However, in exchange for that, they had lost Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Most of the elite warriors of the Sun Crow race, including most members of the Divine Lair and Emperor Charm's royal guards, survived the battle.</p>

  <p>During the war, when Emperor Charm was still alive, Elizabeth, Micah, and their other colleagues had undergone fierce mental struggles. When Zheng ordered them to attack their emperor, there were a lot of contradictory feelings that couldn't be pushed aside.</p>

  <p>Likewise, because they were his loyal subordinates, Emperor Charm wasn't able to fully harm them.</p>

  <p>Now that Emperor Charm was no more, it meant that the core of the Sun Crow race had disappeared, and they had no other choice but to follow Zheng with all their hearts.</p>

  <p>Also, after defeating Emperor Charm, the energy soul of the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi gave up the body out of his own accord.</p>

  <p>By then, Flamine, Pearce, and the others had already realized that the Eastern Emperor Taiyi that they knew was still in slumber, and there was someone else who occupied his body. This person was none other than the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi that was inside Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Considering the troubled times, I must say that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi can still stay in his body since the current one hasn't returned from the Other Shore yet," Pearce suggested.</p>

  <p>In Pearce's mind, the most important thing at present was to ensure the safety of the Oneness Sky Palace. If there came another being that was as powerful as Emperor Charm and attacked them at their chaotic state, he knew that they might not be able to last.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already returned to Zheng's inner world and entered the Civilization Artifact. Zheng served as a mediator to deliver him Pearce's message.</p>

  <p>After a while, Zheng received Eastern Emperor Taiyi's response and a slight frown became visible on his face. "He refuses. He says that if the Oneness Sky Palace was in danger again, he would definitely help with all his might.</p>

  <p>However, he doesn't want to stay in his body if it isn't necessary."</p>

  <p>"Really? I heard that all the creatures on the Other Shore are reluctant to leave the chaos.</p>

  <p>Why would he refuse to stay?" Pearce asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Since he had been working for Eastern Emperor Taiyi for so long, Pearce was quite knowledgeable of the situation.</p>

  <p>Those creatures that had been born in the chaos and then later entered the Other Shore, all missed their past old lives in the chaos because they were already trapped on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore creatures were even willing to be carried and become other people's Other Shore Tokens so that they could have a chance to cross and see the chaos again.</p>

  <p>However, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi seemed to be unwilling to experience that.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's because he knows that this is just a temporary matter. He may be afraid that he can't give it up later," Auden chimed in and gave his opinion.</p>

  <p>Most of the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace who managed to survive were all seriously injured.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, due to their high cultivation level, recovery would be a sure thing.</p>

  <p>That was why Auden, who also took severe damage during the earlier battle, looked much better now.</p>

  <p>"Oh, at least someone understands!" Houyi suddenly appeared and commented on Auden's remark.</p>

  <p>"We have been locked in the dark temple for countless years, motionless as a statue. We have lived without any desire, any greed or anything. Yes, it is so exciting to be able to come back to this world and experience the previous life. And that exactly is the main reason why he will be reluctant to leave later. So, he made the right choice!" Houyi explained.</p>

  <p>He saw everyone staring at him in a daze. "And yeah, I'm leaving too!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he returned to Zheng's inner world too.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, who was that man?" Pearce couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Now they understood that none of the people residing within Zheng's body was ordinary, especially the old man that just appeared suddenly and talked directly to the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>"That was Houyi. I borrowed his bow to extinguish Emperor Charm's suns."</p>

  <p>Zheng explained that the bow and arrows he had used to shoot down Emperor Charm's suns were from Houyi.</p>

  <p>Pearce and the others present were all amazed by the story. They had never imagined that humans had once possessed such tremendous abilities.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Libby was helping others treat their wounds in a nearby place. Naturally, she heard all the tales told by Zheng. A trace of sulk appeared on her delicate and pretty face.</p>

  <p>In this war, all her pride turned into dust.</p>

  <p>This man, who had advanced so much faster than her, had turned the tide of the entire war all by himself. He had relied on his own abilities to suppress and defeat the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>He put under his control the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and the members of the Sun Crow race, and ultimately defeated Emperor Charm to end the war.</p>

  <p>With that said, everyone else in the Oneness Sky Palace just acted the supporting role.</p>

  <p>As for Libby, it was already a great performance from her to be able to help and support Athemar and Goran in their battles.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>While Libby was lost in thought, sounds of explosions were heard coming from inside the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>During the fierce battle between Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm, the center part of the Oneness Mountain had been riddled with huge holes. Moreover, this part was the weakest point of the mountain. As the mountain couldn't bear the pressure from the upper area, the inner part gradually collapsed, and it began to slowly crumble.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Mountain is collapsing!" someone immediately shouted.</p>

  <p>If the upper part of the mountain fell, Dragon City, which was at the foot of the mountain, would be completely crushed to nothingness.</p>

  <p>Although the Dragon City had already been in ruins, thanks to the members of the Bearing race, it was not completely destroyed. It could still be salvaged and be brought back to its original state. However, if the Oneness Mountain smashed it down, there would be nothing left to rebuild.</p>

  <p>Boom! Crash!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that the mountain was continuously tilting sideward, Zheng immediately directed his order to the Sun Crow race, "Hold back the Oneness Mountain!"</p>

  <p>As soon as they heard the order, the members of the Sun Crow race appeared on the side of the upper part of the Oneness Mountain in a flash.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The combined strength unleashed by several powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Also, some of the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace that had already recovered rushed forward to help the members of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>However, even with the combined efforts of the two groups, it wasn't enough to stop the sliding of the upper part of the Oneness Mountain The mountain was just too huge.</p>

  <p>Compared to it, their bodies were like insects who were trying to push off an enormous boulder.</p>

  <p>When they exerted their forces and pushed the mountain wall, the soft surface of the mountain began to crumble. As a result, they sank into it.</p>

  <p>When the members of the Sun Crow race found this problem, they spread out their wings and tried to increase the surface area of their contact against the mountain. However, this tactic still failed and they also sank into it.</p>

  <p>In this kind of situation, it would be easier if the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi used his Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>However, since the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already returned into Zheng's inner world, it was not appropriate to call him right away.</p>

  <p>As Zheng perceived that the situation was getting out of hand, he also dashed and appeared on the side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>'There's no other choice. Wild God Body!'</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng turned into a colossal giant, and started pushing the falling part of the mountain with his entire body.</p>
