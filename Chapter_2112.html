  <p>
</p>

  <p>"And the Time Law. These three laws have been suppressed in the divine land. The use of them is limited by the rules stated on that stone slab,"</p>

  <p>Saul reminded with a callous look.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean even the Holy Beings can't fly?" Luo Luo Zheng raised another question. Curiosity began to invade his mind.</p>

  <p>Saul shrugged his shoulders. "Not really. In reality, the top-rank True Gods can resist the suppressive power and fly. Master Evil and Wayne are both only at the peak of mid-rank True Gods' level, so they are unable to resist the suppressive power. Therefore, they can only run on the ground. However, as warriors grow stronger, their resistance to the limits of the stone slab also improves."</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Luo Zheng nodded as he digested his newfound knowledge.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished his words, a sharp, high-pitched sound could be heard from outside the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>As the high-pitched sound reverberated, the ground under Luo Zheng's feet also began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Everything in the Swirl Forest was unfathomable. Moreover, the divine land was extremely stable. The thing that could cause such a commotion must be an extremely powerful existence. It could shake the earth beneath. Such power would be extremely mighty.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng's gaze pierced through the eaves of the Immortal Mansion. Suddenly, a huge white ape entered his field of vision.</p>

  <p>The ape, which was about two thousand feet tall, stood at the edge of the Immortal Mansion's outer wall. As its slender and powerful arms dropped to the ground, it sized up Luo Luo Zheng with its bright yellow eyes. It opened its bloody mouth slightly and howled ferociously.</p>

  <p>As he was stared at by the ape, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if his entire body was suddenly pressured by the weight of trillions of tons of power. The intense pressure made it even more difficult for him to move.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. All the beasts in the Swirl Forest are very powerful. Normal True Gods are not even matches for them. Their raw power is extremely destructive. The ape is calling upon its own kind. It may attack at any time," Saul said to Luo Luo Zheng with a voice full of caution. "You can release Blackie now."</p>

  <p>The bubble enchanted barrier of the Immortal Mansion covered quite a large area. The huge white ape had already reached the borders of the Immortal Mansion. Within seconds, the ape would already be inside the territory of the Immortal Mansion. Luo Luo Zheng was left with no time to activate the enchanted barrier to keep it out.</p>

  <p>The first time he stepped into the Immortal Mansion in the Eastern Region, he encountered a huge white tiger at the edge of the barrier. Luckily, the bubble enchanted barrier was able to divide the space of the divine land into two worlds, the inside and the outside of the Immortal Mansion. Otherwise, with Luo Zheng's strength at that time, he would have been already killed by the tiger's glare. Such was the power of the beasts in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>At his current predicament, Luo Luo Zheng had already grown much stronger.</p>

  <p>However, he still felt an intense pressure when he faced the giant white ape.</p>

  <p>His expression remained calm, but a single thought had already flashed through his mind. Since he had been in complete control of the Immortal Mansion, a single thought of his could affect the Immortal Mansion. All of its property and amenities were easily at his disposal.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>In the backyard of the Immortal Mansion, the Fairy Chain that was tied to Blackie was quietly broken. Suddenly Blackie was freed!</p>

  <p>The lion-sized Soul-shaking Mastiff charged out of its house. It then immediately turned into a black stream of light and rapidly shot onto the wall of the Immortal Mansion. With great haste, it rushed over via the Immortal Mansion's roof.</p>

  <p>"Awoo!"</p>

  <p>The huge white ape directed its ferocious eyes straight at Luo Luo Zheng. However, as it sensed the arrival of the Soul-shaking Mastiff, the huge white ape suddenly waved its hands which were thousands of feet long. As its enormous hands penetrated through the wall of the Immortal Mansion, the huge white ape tried to grab Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Back off!" Saul warned with a low voice.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng felt a great pressure, he naturally knew that it was better to retreat first when he saw the giant hairy hands that approached him. With extensive battle experience, his instincts had grown quite sharp.</p>

  <p>Unable to fly in the air, he had no choice but to leap backward. His body rose up from the ground and drew an arc in the air as he jumped.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to fall into the pond in the Immortal Mansion, the huge white ape acted quickly. The moment Luo Luo Zheng jumped up, it changed the direction of its two giant hands and grabbed him in midair. An enormous fist tightly gripped Luo Zheng's body. Then, it tried to drag him out of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>The Swirl Forest was one of the forbidden lands for True Gods. In addition to huge white apes, there were also some other unimaginable and dangerous monsters. If Luo Luo Zheng was taken to the forest, he would not be able to protect himself with his current strength.</p>

  <p>However, before the huge white ape could retract its hand, a black shadow jumped up from the roof of the weapon refining workshop. The Soul-shaking Mastiff named Blackie let out a series of roars. Intense pressure accompanied each of his barks.</p>

  <p>Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</p>

  <p>The power contained in the roars could make many creatures feel fear, and the huge white ape was no exception. Its giant hand that held Luo Luo Zheng trembled involuntarily. Terror seemed to devour the huge white ape's feral mind.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the Soul-shaking Mastiff had already bit onto the arm of the giant white ape.</p>
