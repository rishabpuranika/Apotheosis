<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1110 Sun Flame Attack (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Because Fiona had mainly cultivated the Fire Law and the Time Law, the contractual beast she had summoned through her bloodline was a fire phoenix!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's body was a fairy weapon, and it made him completely immune to fire. He was just worried that he didn't have a chance to increase the strength of his physical body!</p>

  <p>The higher the strength of the body, the more power of the dragon scales Luo Zheng would be able to use. It was a piece of cake for Luo Zheng to gather weapons to refine heavenly essence, but his physical body would not be able to withstand too much force. If he utilized too much of the dragon scales' power, his physical body would disintegrate.</p>

  <p>Fiona leaned backwards until she was finally sitting on the feathers of the great phoenix behind her. Then, she pointed at Luo Zheng with her finger and said, "Fiery Shine, Sun Flame Attack!"</p>

  <p>"Aoo!"</p>

  <p>The Genuine Phoenix named Fiery Shine suddenly raised its head and opened its mouth. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth began surging through its body and it gathered in its mouth.</p>

  <p>'It could directly absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?' Luo Zheng thought, fully taken aback by what had happened.</p>

  <p>When the phoenix absorbed enough spiritual energy of heaven and earth, it locked its gaze on Luo Zheng, who was standing not too far away.</p>

  <p>Just as the Genuine Phoenix was about to launch its attack on Luo Zheng, Fiona suddenly appeared in front of it. She placed her hand on the phoenix's head and said something not audible to anyone but the two of them. It was as if she was whispering something to its ear. Then, they seemed to begin having a conversation. After a few moments of seemingly exchanging sentiments, the two came to an agreement. Fiona turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Tianxing, I've already proven my ability! You should understand that if the Sun Flame Attack comes out from my Genuine Phoenix, you will definitely turn into ashes!" Fiona shouted, her eyes locked with Zheng's. She was not fooling around. "Before you do anything dumb, consider what's in front of you carefully. It's not too late to back off!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wondered what Fiona was trying to do. He didn't expect that she would order her contractual beast to stop attacking moments before it would. 'What is happening?' he thought to himself, totally flustered.</p>

  <p>Fiona reminded Luo Zheng of the danger he was up against out of goodwill.</p>

  <p>Although her contractual beast was a young phoenix that was only at the ninth level, it was still a super legendary beast. Its power was not something that any ordinary fierce beast could even compare with.</p>

  <p>"I think that Tianxing should just admit defeat. To be able to force the royal family to use a super legendary beast, he has already caught much attention. With his current achievements, I'm sure the Harlen Divine Kingdom will reward him greatly!"</p>

  <p>"People like Tianxing wouldn't admit defeat easily. He would have already admitted defeat earlier if he were that kind of a cowardly man."</p>

  <p>"Well, if he doesn't admit defeat, he'll just have to wait for death. If he wants to die that badly, no one will stop him. Our princess Fiona has already given him chances to save his pathetic life!"</p>

  <p>No one from the spectators believed that Luo Zheng would come out of this duel alive.</p>

  <p>The martial artists in the Divine Kingdom Continent had a much wider range of knowledge and experience than those of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they also had a great deal of materials that were passed down from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>They had a clear concept about the legendary beast and the super legendary beast. For instance, many people could estimate that the strength of this ninth level Genuine Phoenix in front of them was at least equivalent to that of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm. Even martial artists at the fourth or fifth level of the Life and Death Realm would not be a match for it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and even if he had extraordinary talents, what could he do to resist the Genuine Phoenix's force? It was sure that he would be burnt into ashes before he could even get close to the beast.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Luo Zheng said calmly to the princess,</p>

  <p>"Thank you, but sorry."</p>

  <p>He said "thank you" to thank Fiona for giving him a chance to reconsider his decision, and he said "sorry" to tell her that he wouldn't admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Fiona revealed an expression full of regret. Summoning Fiery Shine was the decision made after careful thought. As a martial artist, she would never be able to escape a duel with another warrior. It was as necessary as eating was to humans: it was a rule that she could not break, no matter what.</p>

  <p>Since she couldn't avoid it, she could only accept it. Fiona finally decided to fight with Luo Zheng with her real strength.</p>

  <p>This battle with Luo Zheng made her realize what her mission and responsibilities were, and she understood more clearly what expectations her royal father had for her!</p>

  <p>Before, she would've chosen to surrender rather than summon Fiery Shine to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But this time was different. She did not want to disappoint her royal father.</p>

  <p>After seeing that her warning had no effect on Luo Zheng, Fiona's eyes narrowed greatly. She turned back to her phoenix, and patted its head in a knowing manner. Fiery Shine had been waiting for a long time. After it received Fiona's orders, it opened its mouth, and a ten feet wide beam of flame shot towards Luo Zheng.</p>
