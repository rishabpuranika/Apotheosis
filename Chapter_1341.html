<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1341 Weapons Under The Dome </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Standing at the entrance of the Weapon House, Luo Luo Zheng keenly observed for a while and then saw two people walk over.</p>

  <p>They happened to be those who had clashed with Luo Luo Zheng on the stairs of the Mist Palace previously. Each of them held a small jade pendant in their hands. After waving it in front of the two Spirit Supreme Realm guards, they were permitted to enter the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>Then a sudden realization hit Luo Luo Zheng as he took in this scene.</p>

  <p>'I'm so stupid, ' he mused. The jade pendant, which was given to him by Yolande, of course, had its uses.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he walked up to the guards and also waved his jade pendant before entering the Weapon House right behind the two warriors.</p>

  <p>The other warriors standing outside the House made a ruckus and wanted to squeeze in just behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The faces of the two guards at the entrance darkened as they swiftly blocked their path.</p>

  <p>"We're just going in to take a look. Given that we don't have a jade pendant, we can't choose weapons."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't affect anything. Please let us in."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his head to look back and was speechless. 'I'm only picking a weapon. What is there to look at?' he thought, shaking his head. It seemed that there was no lack of gossips everywhere, even in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that their pleas would be so effective. The guards just said, "Don't make a ruckus in there! Anyone who doesn't obey the rule will be thrown out."</p>

  <p>After receiving the approval of the two guards, those warriors gladly followed Luo Luo Zheng into the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Hey! Hey, newcomer." A warrior at the eighth level of Life and Death Realm patted Luo Zheng's shoulder from behind.</p>

  <p>However, before he could touch Luo Luo Zheng, his body gently twisted, easily dodging this patter. He then asked indifferently, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>The warrior was surprised for a moment before he probed, "What rank of weapon do you want to choose?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "Naturally, the more suitable the weapon, the better."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, that's a good answer. These juniors are now staring at the powerful weapons. They don't know what suits them the best!" said a white-eyebrowed elder who was seated in a corner of the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head towards the old man and smiled. The old man then said, "If you want to choose a weapon, you can now hand over the jade pendant to me."</p>

  <p>After turning over the jade pendant, Luo Luo Zheng carefully looked around the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Weapon House was a wide dome, and under this dome, there floated numerous balls of light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng silently scrutinized these balls of light. Then he figured out that they, in fact, contained weapons of all shapes and sizes.</p>

  <p>"There are loads of divine weapons!"</p>

  <p>No wonder when Luo Luo Zheng asked Yolande whether there were divine weapons in the Weapon House, her face showed an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. She probably thought that he had underestimated the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Each one of the weapons wrapped in these balls of light was a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>It was probably Luo Zheng's words that made the white-eyebrowed elder feel very comfortable, so he gleefully added, "All these weapons in the Weapon House are divine weapons. But they are also divided into different ranks. Those divine weapons at the bottom are of the secondary third rank, which is the lowest level."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. The secondary third-rank divine weapons in the Weapon House were semi-divine weapons in the eyes of the warriors from the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>"The higher a weapon is, the higher its rank. And the difficulty of obtaining a weapon also increases as you move up. If you want to secure one of the high-rank divine weapons, you'll have to rely on your own abilities!" the white-eyebrowed elder said.</p>

  <p>Right at this time, the two warriors who had been at loggerheads with Luo Luo Zheng strolled over from the other side of the Weapon House. There was another person beside them. This person was already at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Luo Zheng had taunted the two warriors in front of the vice leader of Mist Palace. How could their faces look good after they'd discovered Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>When one of them saw Luo Luo Zheng, he immediately told the Soul Sea Realm warrior, "Rhydian, it's him!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" The Soul Sea Realm warrior casually sized Luo Luo Zheng up and sauntered over. "You are just a brat at the Life and Death Realm and even from the Lower World. I've never seen someone act so arrogantly."</p>

  <p>This Soul Sea Realm warrior was very young, so it was unbefitting for him to call Luo Luo Zheng a brat.</p>

  <p>When the warriors who came to watch Luo Luo Zheng select a weapon noticed the Soul Sea Realm warrior, their expressions also became cautious. They were muttering to themselves, "How did this new guy offend him?"</p>

  <p>The thirteen palaces were originally places to train talents from the 3, 000 supreme worlds. The ultimate goal was to gather all of the most talented warriors and produce even more powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was only one of the thirteen palaces, and it held a very competitive stance against the other twelve palaces.</p>

  <p>By the same token, the warriors in the Mist Palace were also severed into two groups.</p>

  <p>Those warriors who had just gained entry in the Mist Palace belonged to the Ice Cloud House. Luo Luo Zheng was classed as a new disciple since he hadn't gone through a series of formalities yet, so he also belonged to the Ice Cloud House. The stronger ones could enter the Swallow Cloud House.</p>

  <p>This Soul Sea Realm warrior before him was called Rhydian Xie.</p>

  <p>Although he was also a member of the Ice Cloud House, he was ranked significantly higher. Perhaps he could be promoted to the Swallow Cloud House in the next semester.</p>

  <p>Rhydian Xie was not only powerful and talented, but he was even the son of a world lord. His younger brother, Matteo Xie, had also been enrolled into the Mist Palace. He took his brother here to choose a suitable weapon.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Matteo Xie did not lose the opportunity to inform him that there seemed to be a newcomer, who was supremely arrogant and appallingly daring to talk back in front of the vice leader of the Mist Palace. When he met Luo Luo Zheng, he would inevitably ridicule him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm after he listened to what Rhydian Xie solicited.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had answered back only to help Yolande. Although the other party had openly provoked him, Luo Luo Zheng was too lazy to open his mouth. Instead, he asked the white-eyebrowed elder, "Do I only have one chance to choose a weapon?"</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder assented, "Yes. According to the rules of the Weapon House, you only have one chance!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grinned slightly and was just about to fly up to retrieve a weapon when Rhydian Xie halted him. "My brother came first, so he should take it first."</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder seemed to like Luo Luo Zheng more. Upon hearing that, he gazed at Luo Luo Zheng as if asking for his opinion. Luo Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and revealed a casual expression. Then the white-eyebrowed elder said,</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter who comes first. Both of you can enter and obtain a weapon."</p>

  <p>Rhydian Xie tapped Matteo Xie on the shoulder and cast a warning glance at Luo Luo Zheng. All the people within the thirteen palaces were talents from many supreme worlds. And Rhydian Xie had a high ranking in the Ice Cloud House, so he looked down upon Luo Luo Zheng, thinking he was a mere warrior from the Lower World. Subsequently, there would be lots of chances to make Luo Luo Zheng suffer, and he wouldn't even need to do it himself.</p>

  <p>He then urged his younger brother, "Do your best and strive to obtain a secondary first-rank divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>Although the majority of the warriors here virtually possessed a solid background, not everyone could acquire a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>For example, the State Sword that Fenton was using didn't belong to him. It was given to him by the Saint Lord, and if Fenton left the Myriad Spiritual Force House, he would have to return the sword.</p>

  <p>Matteo Xie lightly bobbed his head as he listened to his brother before walking to the center of the hall. After sweeping a glance at the dome, he immediately leaped up.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>All the balls of light under the dome began to dance about as soon as Matteo Xie jumped sharply into the air.</p>

  <p>By the time Matteo Xie had jumped to a height of 20 feet, his speed had already slackened down. From the looks of it, he seemed to be struggling a bit.</p>

  <p>Keeping their eyes glued on this rueful scene, the surrounding warriors couldn't help starting to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Rhydian Xie is extraordinarily powerful, but his little brother is nothing special."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he can get a secondary first-rank divine weapon. Maybe he is even unable to get a secondary second-rank divine weapon. Tsk! Tsk!</p>

  <p>How embarrassing!"</p>

  <p>"Such a waste! I'd rather exchange my secondary second-rank divine weapon for his jade pendant so that I can give it a try. Maybe I can snatch a good one."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng originally not understood what was going on with the balls of light, but now he finally comprehended. Matteo Xie was also a warrior at the ninth-grade of the Life and Death Realm, which made him comparable to Fenton in terms of cultivation level. However, it was not easy for him to seize a good weapon.</p>

  <p>Matteo Xie's face turned red as he struggled harder and harder until he, at last, managed to get hold of a ball of light before plummeting down from the air.</p>

  <p>He had only clutched a third-rank divine weapon, which was an ax. And its estimated value was to be around 20 to 30 life vitality jades. The question whether it was valuable aside, he had undeniably lost his face.</p>

  <p>"I don't want this!" Matteo Xie protested stubbornly after he got up.</p>

  <p>Throwing the golden ax to the side, he steadied himself and was about to fly up to the dome once again.</p>

  <p>However, the white-eyebrowed elder reached out his hand and gently pinched it. An invisible force suddenly pressed Matteo Xie down, who had just left the floor. He felt a sudden pang of pain as if he had been struck by a hammer as he fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Only the first time is for free. If you want to try again, you need to pay 300 life vitality jades first," the white-eyebrowed elder stressed coldly.</p>

  <p>"If you want another chance, you must pay upfront!"</p>
