  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every time the blood-red lightning struck Luo Zheng's body, the Truth of Divine Dao surged and flowed through his limbs and bones in waves.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Divine Dao surged around his body and brought the weakened Chaotic Source Spirits back to life. dozens of blood-red lightning bolts struck his body in a row and made him look immensely dangerous. When the Blood Spirit Tortoise looked at Luo Zheng, its huge blood red eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>"He's? completely unharmed? How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise couldn't believe what it saw!</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had just obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body, he could only bear a limited power of about ninety thousand Jun. After he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the Eternal Realm, he could further increase his strength.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the blood-red lightning strike could still tear his body into pieces, even if it couldn't kill him. Yet he was completely unscathed.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise had seen such a strange occurrence before.</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Realm masters, who had fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits, were the same with general injuries. The Chaotic Source Spirits in their bodies absorbed the power unleashed upon them, so their bodies remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>The Blood Spirit Tortoise had always loathed those powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm. They weren't qualified to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, nor were they exceptional or strong enough.</p>

  <p>Although they could use the Chaotic Source Spirits to make up for their physical bodies' weaknesses and even create a realm called the "Chaotic Source Realm", all of those simply served to cover up their flaws.</p>

  <p>Even those masters at the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm could only bear about twenty thousand Jun of force. They weren't worth mentioning at all.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible! It can't be the Chaotic Source Spirits!"</p>

  <p>The maximum power that the Chaotic Source Spirits could bear was quite low, and they definitely couldn't withstand about eighty thousand Jun of power.</p>

  <p>But why was Luo Zheng still uninjured after the blood-red lightning had hit him?</p>

  <p>"You can try again," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the Blood Spirit Tortoise got a little impatient, so he deliberately provoked it.</p>

  <p>As long as the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attacks didn't exceed a force of one hundred thousand Jun, it wouldn't cause him substantial damage.</p>

  <p>Even if its power did exceed one hundred thousand Jun, his newly acquired Myriad Tribulations Body could still endure it.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, his Myriad Tribulations Body had nine Holy Soul Imprints, which made it more powerful than an ordinary Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he did not forget that he was still trapped on the Other Shore of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was highly likely that the Blood Spirit Tortoise couldn't do anything to him, but it was also difficult for him to kill it.</p>

  <p>His greatest chance at killing it lay on the Celestial Spear in his hand. The spear could increase his strength by about four times now, but he could only use it once.</p>

  <p>He only had one chance. He hoped that he could hit his opponent in one spear strike!</p>

  <p>At that point, the Blood Spirit Tortoise increased its guard. After all, it didn't believe that Luo Zheng could resist the lightning it spat out without sustaining any injuries.</p>

  <p>It thought that Luo Zheng must have a special method to save his life, but no matter what magical method it was, there were still limits.</p>

  <p>He couldn't withstand everything infinitely.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom"</p>

  <p>The thicker blood-red lightning rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blood-red lightning spread around Luo Zheng until an area with the radius of ten thousand feet looked like a purgatory.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how powerful the creatures present were, it was hard for them to stay safe in that area.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng had survived.</p>

  <p>Above the Taiyi Heaven Palace</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden, and the others also watched the scene with undivided attention. "Is this the strength of the Myriad Tribulations Body?" Pearce asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Although Pearce and the rest never had the chance to cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Body their whole lives, they knew how powerful the Myriad Tribulations Body was, since they had stayed in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for a long time.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Tribulations Body itself served to strengthen one's physical body, unlike the Chaotic Source Spirits, which made one's physical body invincible to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>In other words, if a force of over ten thousand Jun hit a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, the warrior would remain unharmed.</p>

  <p>However, if that same power struck a warrior with the Myriad Tribulations Body, the warrior might sustain slight injuries.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible!" Auden shook his head firmly and said, "The Myriad Tribulations Body couldn't be unscarred in such a situation. Perhaps he has relied on the Chaotic Source Spirits to absorb so many Jun of power..."</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>Pearce, Qiu Yinhe, and many powerful warriors from the Taiyi Heaven Palace were stunned.</p>

  <p>"It's true," Winchell stated. "It seems that Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits have absorbed all the energy..." he trailed off.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Spirit Tortoise is one of the ten fiercest beasts of the chaos, and it can casually launch an attack with at least seventy thousand Jun of force! Do you mean that Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits are so strong that they could bear such a large amount of power?" Pearce asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Many of the Holy Soul Realm warriors present had already cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits to the extremes.</p>

  <p>They could bear twenty-five thousand Jun of power at most with the help of other body protection treasures and cultivation methods, and that was the limit. It was common sense.</p>

  <p>So, the meaning of Pearce's words was very simple? no matter how powerful Luo Zheng was, he couldn't withstand such a strong force with only the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Winchell just shrugged and said, "I don't know the specific reason, but from his performance, it's true."</p>

  <p>After all, there were many strange things that had happened to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And so, it didn't seem odd for something strange to happen to him again.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce, regardless, it's still advantageous as Luo Zheng could resist the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attack," Li Bianxue suddenly reminded.</p>

  <p>Because what happened just now was too unusual, no one paid attention to the core issue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swayed back and forth in the streaks of blood-red lightning, but in the end, he was still unharmed.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Although the Blood Spirit Tortoise can't do anything to Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng can't do anything to it either. I wonder if he can break free from it,"</p>

  <p>Auden commented.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a bolt of blood-red lightning hit Luo Zheng hard and he bounced upwards.</p>

  <p>"A chance?"</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng quickly jumped up, turned into a meteor, and flew towards the Blood Spirit Tortoise.</p>

  <p>"You little human, how dare you fight back? Scram!" the Blood Spirit Tortoise hissed.</p>

  <p>It opened its huge mouth and spat out blood-red lightning again.</p>

  <p>The thick, blood-red lightning whipped and lashed at Luo Zheng several times and sent him flying more than ten thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng stabilized his body, and with narrowed eyes, he retorted, "You are just a coward. You aren't strong at all, but you have the gall to make such reckless remarks. It's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Blood Spirit Tortoise, Luo Zheng was just a nobody that the Element Spirit race ordered it to eliminate.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was enraged when an unimportant being like Luo Zheng mocked it. It immediately spewed out lightning to consume the unknown body protection token on Luo Zheng's body out of infuriation.</p>

  <p>However, its series of attacks did not affect Luo Zheng at all. Instead, he just laughed at it. How could it tolerate him?</p>

  <p>In the end, it lost its patience in anger. It suddenly opened its mouth, which revealed rows of fangs, with blood-red lightning bolts that surrounded them.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think I can't do anything to you? I'm going to swallow you!"</p>

  <p>The moment the Blood Spirit Tortoise finished speaking, its head abruptly extended from its turtle shell and dashed towards Luo Zheng like a long dragon.</p>

  <p> </p>
