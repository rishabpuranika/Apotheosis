<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1809 The Godly Genius Named Maha </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Master Feng's expression was cold as he stared at Maha the warrior.</p>

  <p>If the huge mountain had been split open, even if it later closed, it should have left a crack behind. However, with just a light step by Master Feng, the crack running down Breaking Cloud Mountain began to heal itself just like a human's wound would do.</p>

  <p>Even though his opponent was only a world lord, he represented the invader side. This person must be an individual of great significance, so Master Feng did not choose to immediately attack.</p>

  <p>The collapse of the Sighing Wall was completely beyond everyone's expectations. Furthermore, the Spring race was destroyed too quickly for the Celestial Position to take any action to prevent it.</p>

  <p>It was only to be expected that after the Sacred race had occupied the three supreme worlds, they would rapidly advance, taking over one supreme world after another!</p>

  <p>Given their current strength, the Sacred race could easily achieve their goal without difficulty.</p>

  <p>However, it was at this moment, that instead of advancing they had suddenly begun negotiations. Even the Supreme Lords were puzzled.</p>

  <p>They wondered what the Sacred race was trying to achieve?</p>

  <p>"Haha, the rumors said that, although he is a Supreme Lord, the Heavenly Destiny this old man carries is very special. He has the strength to fight a True God, it seems like the rumors are true," Maha slowly rubbed his nose and said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Although the ten Godly Geniuses sometimes secretly called the head of the Celestial Position race "old man", in the entire universe only Xenia dared to call him that publicly.</p>

  <p>This Maha was merely world lord, yet he spoke so casually. He respected the head of the Celestial Position in his words, however, in fact, everyone could tell just how arrogant he was.</p>

  <p>"A mere world lord dares to act so presumptuously? The dignified Sacred race isn't that big of a deal," the Supreme Lord of Oracle could also bear it no longer. Her beautiful face clouded with gloom.</p>

  <p>After being scolded by Supreme Lord of Oracle, Maha remained calm.</p>

  <p>He turned his head to take in the appearance of Supreme Lord of Oracle, and then clicked his tongue twice, "It's said that among the four greatest Supreme Lords in the universe, Supreme Lord of Oracle is known for her unrivalled beauty. Seeing is believing."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke, Maha didn't bother to conceal the lewd and evil intent lurking in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum was unable to watch any longer. With a flip of his hand, he sent a slap flying!</p>

  <p>When a Supreme Lord took action, the world would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>This slap contained sufficient power to kill a world lord.</p>

  <p>In his anger, Supreme Lord Healum did not hold himself at all!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The slap from Supreme Lord Healum had transformed into a gigantic golden palm image.</p>

  <p>However, Maha didn't show the slightest sign of panic. As he stood there on the spot, a faint treasure light emerged from his body!</p>

  <p>The palm shadow suddenly struck Maha's light and it instantly shattered, disappearing without a trace!</p>

  <p>When the other Supreme Lords saw this, they all frowned.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum was one of the top three Supreme Lords in the Humanity Alliance, second only to Supreme Lord Illusion and Supreme Lord of Oracle.</p>

  <p>The slap might seem a simple thing, but it contained the ultimate Wind Law!</p>

  <p>If it was so easily blocked, then this Maha was definitely in possession of a great treasure?</p>

  <p>A great treasure that could block an all-out attack of a Supreme Lord didn't exist anywhere in the universe. Truly, no power in the universe could compare to what the Sacred race had.</p>

  <p>"Humph, a trivial mid-rank Supreme Lord dares to attack me. You really overestimate yourself." Maha mocked as he stared defiantly at Supreme Lord Healum.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord's temperament wasn't easily shaken, but at this moment, Supreme Lord Healum was extremely angry, his complexion already becoming ugly. A mere world lord dared to speak so rudely and to humiliate Supreme Lord of Oracle!</p>

  <p>The most insulting part was that even though Maha was a world lord, he wasn't even a hundred years old! And the Supreme Lords that stood in front of Maha were easily over ten million years old!</p>

  <p>"This Maha is courting death," Nathan said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this guy too arrogant?" Lawson's expression had now also turned unfriendly.</p>

  <p>The two Supreme Lords that clashed with Maha were not Supreme Lords of Thoughtless Minds, but, after all, they were humans and they were in the same universe!</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses were of an age where their blood ran hot.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they could not remain calm and unperturbed like the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng's complexion had darkened. Just what sort of strength did Maha have to act so arrogantly in front of these Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>This time, Supreme Lord Healum was planning on taking serious action!</p>

  <p>However, just as Supreme Lord Healum was about to make his move, the nine Supreme Lords from Sacred race that had been floating in the distance all descended!</p>

  <p>Of these nine Supreme Lords from Sacred race, there were actually five mid-rank Supreme Lords! Four of them were top-rank Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>At the moment Supreme Lord Healum was about to make his move, a top-rank Supreme Lord from Sacred race blocked his path!</p>

  <p>The battle was about to begin!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords in the universe had the numerical advantage. Once they attacked, with over fifty Supreme Lords working together, they should be able to completely devour every single one of these Supreme Lords from Sacred race.</p>

  <p>But, who could guarantee that the Sacred race would not have reinforcements?</p>

  <p>If a True God from the Sacred race appeared, how would they be able to resist?</p>

  <p>With a flash of her body, Supreme Lord of Oracle lightly brushed past Supreme Lord Healum with her hands, dissolving his attack. With a cold expression, she looked at Maha and said, "I want to hear what exactly you want to negotiate. The nature and results of the negotiation will decide whether you'll die or live."</p>

  <p>As one of the most powerful Supreme Lords in the universe, when had Supreme Lord of Oracle ever had to fear for her life?</p>

  <p>She was the only female of the leaders of the three great human forces, and with just her power alone, she had carried almost the entire burden of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>However, there had to be strange things in this abnormal situation. Maha wasn't an idiot. Even if he was, the nine Supreme Lords from Sacred race beside him weren't. Those who behaved arrogantly usually had a reason to act that way.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle's attitude was resolute. If Maha were really an idiot, speaking nonsense in front of her, Supreme Lord of Oracle would naturally take his life.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," Maha faintly smiled. However, this fellow continued to speak to Supreme Lord Healum, "You still seem unconvinced? A Supreme Lord of Humanity Alliance, I've never heard of you even though I've searched many souls. You can't be that famous in the universe, right? To deal with you, all I need to do is to carry a Heavenly Destiny! If I become a True God in the future, I will kill you with just one finger!"</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race had invaded the Spring race, they began to search the souls of the warriors. They gathered a lot of information from the universe. They also gained a good understanding of the power distribution within the universe.</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he extended his little finger and pointed it at Supreme Lord Healum.</p>

  <p>"Reckless!"</p>

  <p>This time, even Supreme Lord of Oracle couldn't tolerate this. A massive Mu Ning suddenly swept out. She didn't choose to directly attack, she only wanted Maha to suffer!</p>

  <p>Her extremely sharp Mu Ning was an attack that was powered by her soul.</p>

  <p>The secret soul technique had become a patch of thorny roses that rapidly shot towards Maha's head!</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lord from Sacred race standing in front of Maha suddenly waved both of his hands. A pale purple light wrapped around his hands, and he began to tear apart all of the roses one by one!</p>

  <p>Physical attacks normally could not be directed at the soul, but this Supreme Lord from Sacred race was able to do just that.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all of the roses had been crushed!</p>

  <p>Maha faintly smiled and was about to speak when an intense pain enveloped his mind. His entire body instantly fell to the ground and he began to wail.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle stared at Maha coldly. She had held back just now. Otherwise, she would have completely destroyed Maha's soul!</p>

  <p>"Damn it, this is great!"</p>

  <p>"This fellow should be taught a lesson!"</p>

  <p>"He has probably been tortured quite miserably!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Maha's miserable condition, Lawson and the others felt their hearts start to swell with joy.</p>

  <p>After Maha had rolled on the ground for a good while, the pain gradually dissipated. As he slowly got to his feet, a trace of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth!</p>

  <p>Maha wiped away the blood, but still retained a smile on his face. "Ha-ha, a beauty gifted me flowers that left behind a lingering fragrance?"</p>

  <p>It was probably Maha's plan to continue insulting them. But, that Supreme Lord from Sacred race that stood in front of Maha finally couldn't help but remind him. "Godly Genius, don't play with them. Let's get down to business!"</p>

  <p>"Godly Genius?"</p>

  <p>"Is this guy also a Godly Genius?"</p>

  <p>"His cultivation is much higher than ours. This is unfair."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this form of address, Lucille and the rest were also stunned.</p>

  <p>Now that the ten Godly Geniuses from the universe had been selected, the one with the highest cultivation was Nathan, who was only at the middle stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>As for the others, they were still at the early stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm. As Mu Ning had entered the Illusion Battlefield, she had not gone through any serious battles or experiences, and her cultivation was still only at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>But this Maha, who was also a Godly Genius, was actually a world lord?</p>

  <p>The guy who could break through to the True God realm at any time?</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng and the others finally understood why Maha was so confident.</p>
