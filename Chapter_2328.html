  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reginald had originally trailed behind Soren because he was afraid that the latter might kill Luo Zheng. All his senses were on high alert in case such a thing would happen.</p>

  <p>To his utter surprise, Soren seemed to have sensed a natural enemy in front of him and suddenly flew backwards. He kept a huge distance from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the valley that blocked Soren's way, no one would know where he was now.</p>

  <p>The others were also confused and didn't know what on earth Soren, a top-rank True God, was afraid of. Was he afraid of Luo Zheng? But how?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng really could not control the raging energy in his inner world. He didn't even have a way to activate it. He had tried many times back in the Secret Time Room, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Having been threatened by Soren, Luo Zheng had no choice but to activate the raging energy. If he forced that ball of energy out of his body in a short period of time, then there would be a quick but terrifying explosion.</p>

  <p>Yet, he never thought that Soren would react that way.</p>

  <p>Soren remained glued on the cliff of the valley. The fear in his eyes eventually dissipated, but he still remained highly vigilant.</p>

  <p>He had quite sharp and powerful perception. Furthermore, he could always trigger a strong fighting instinct, especially in the face of life and death. It was one of his talents, and at that moment, his instincts told him that Luo Zheng would kill him if he didn't run away.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, he would launch his most powerful counterattack to kill his opponent when such a feeling arose.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, however, requested that he refrain from hurting Luo Zheng. Thus, he was left with no choice but to leave Luo Zheng's vicinity and run. Of course, the others did not know that.</p>

  <p>Until now, he still couldn't understand how the strange internal momentum in Luo Zheng's body came out and why it made him feel so stressful.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he turned to Nathaniel again once Soren was out of the way.</p>

  <p>A shiver coursed through Nathaniel's spine when he saw that Luo Zheng seemed to have scared his brother away.</p>

  <p>He was weak all over and Luo Zheng's Long Vine Sword still bound him, which left him no room for resistance. If he was pale before, now his skin was the color of a dead person.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really killed Nathaniel, Nicholas, who was outside the forbidden area, would not let him go.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought about it, his right hand suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The frozen ice shell on the surface of his right hand quickly broke apart; then he stretched his hand out and gently waved it downwards. This caused the Long Vine Sword to drag Nathaniel down from the air. As Nathaniel descended, a small amount of blood from his wound caused by the Blood Breaking Bite gushed out.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng slowly walked towards Nathaniel, Soren kicked the mountain wall hard. Then, he flew upwards and landed gracefully on the side like a majestic falcon.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Reginald also calmly stood on the other side and tried to convince Luo Zheng by saying, "Tianxing, don't be impulsive. If he is willing to return the divine might coins to you, then we can let him go!"</p>

  <p>"Nathaniel, give the divine might coins back to Tianxing," Soren ordered. He was starting to have a headache. All he wanted right now was to quickly end this matter!</p>

  <p>He knew that Nicholas kept an eye on him, so he couldn't do anything to Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng was a strange man. Of course, he would be humiliated if Luo Zheng defeated him. He wouldn't have any face to show to the Dongfang Clan if that happened.</p>

  <p>"Give my divine might coins back!" Luo Zheng coldly said and stretched out a hand to Nathaniel. The air between them was filled with tension.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel refused to give up. He looked at his elder brother for help and wondered why he was afraid of Luo Zheng. Soren was an elite warrior among the top-rank True Gods, and to kill Luo Zheng would be a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>"Give the divine might coins back to Tianxing and apologize to him," Soren commanded.</p>

  <p>"I can return them to him, but I don't think I have to apologize." Anger and humiliation were written all over Nathaniel's face. 'When did the Dongfang Clan ever make an apology?' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Do as I say!" Soren bellowed. Needless to say, Nathaniel was sullen at the sight of his angry brother.</p>

  <p>He fumbled around his space ring with some difficulty and brought out the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Before the whole fiasco had started, Luo Zheng had exterminated as many Poisonous Wolf Scorpions as the top-rank True Gods had killed.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel took out all the divine might coins that he had taken from Luo Zheng and piled them up like a small mountain. It was likely that the total number of coins was over a hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently waved his hand, and an invisible force surrounded all the divine might coins. He shook his hand and the force was poured into his space ring.</p>

  <p>His method to keep the divine might coins looked simple but in reality, he had transformed his power into an invisible funnel. The funnel was near Luo Zheng, and that skill had the same principle as the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>'This guy is really able to separate his strength source from his body at will. I wonder how he managed to master the Cross-world token, ' both Soren and Reginald thought to themselves as they watched.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng was done, he turned around and walked down to the Goddess Statue. "I don't need an apology from such a guy," he said to Soren plainly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Nathaniel shouted angrily at Luo Zheng's retreating back.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, never looked back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Kelsey couldn't control her excitement after the whole incident had ended.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, you are so awesome!" she praised and clapped her hands. Her eyes were full of admiration while Luo Zheng trooped back to them. What more couldn't he do?</p>

  <p>The disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands always had similar conflicts, but few of them could intimidate the disciples of the Dongfang Clan like what Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel was fuming mad at Luo Zheng, but he could do nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Kelsey felt that Luo Zheng was really powerful.</p>

  <p>"He is so awesome! It's good that Soren hasn't tried to side with his brother. Otherwise, everything would've gone worse," Aleyna said worriedly.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Liusu knew Luo Zheng better than Kelsey. They knew that he still had a chance to defeat Nathaniel, but they didn't expect that the latter was no match for Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>What the two of them worried about the most was Soren joining the fight. If Soren wanted to kill Luo Zheng, no one could stop him except the top-rank True Gods like Reginald. Moreover, whether or not Reginald was willing to sacrifice his life for Luo Zheng was another question.</p>

  <p>"It's okay. I just want to get my divine might coins back," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Liusu was relieved now that Luo Zheng was safe, but Langston, who stood next to her, looked more miserable.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods noticed that the dispute had ended, and they had killed all the remaining Poisonous Wolf Scorpions together. After all of the scorpions had died, another tremor shook the valley.</p>

  <p>"The beasts of the third wave are coming for us. Everyone, disperse!</p>

  <p>Don't stand together. According to previous experience, the beasts of the third wave are usually birds," Reginald warned in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, black objects flew out from the four entrances of the valley.</p>

  <p>In addition, loud croaking sounds echoed throughout the area.</p>

  <p>Just like Reginald had said, the third wave of beasts that were going to attack them were indeed birds.</p>

  <p>The black birds were called the Dark Crows. They were usually found in the Dark Fog Forest, which was a fourth-grade forbidden area. The Dark Crows flew at a highly fast speed, but they did not attack the True Gods in the valley. Instead, they went straight to the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>It was known that if the Goddess Statue was destroyed, everyone would fail and lose their chance to enter the second stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Therefore, all of them immediately launched into action.</p>

  <p>"Stop those Dark Crows!"</p>

  <p>"Shoot them down!"</p>
