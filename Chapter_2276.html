</p>

  <p>Hearing the boy's words, Augustus was quite confused. "What do you mean? Has Zheng already ascended to the divine land? And is he currently on one of the Floating Islands?" he asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The boy threw a sharp look at Augustus. "If Zheng had ascended to the divine land, then his ascension must have been guided by a member of the Jiang Clan. Do you think those Holy Beings would let him go? Why do you think Harold has been giving so much trouble to the Jiang Clan in the recent times?" he asked, his voice rising.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes!" Augustus patted his forehead.</p>

  <p>Although he was much more talented than his senior fellow disciple in terms of cultivation, he was quite slow as far as analyzing a situation was concerned.</p>

  <p>Augustus then said, "So he entered the divine land in an illegal way.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng is on one of the Floating Islands now, how about we bring him here? I will train him personally, and he is sure to make a rapid progress."</p>

  <p>"Augustus, can you really find him? Do you really think that he is as careless as you are? Let's just say that you found him, then what? Do you think that you can keep him safe on the Gu Clan's Floating Island?" The boy said impatiently, his tone indicated that he perceived Augustus as an ignorant person.</p>

  <p>Bromley had been roaming the boundless chaos for countless years without coming back. If Zheng entered the Gu Clan's Floating Island and the Holy Beings wanted to take him away, there was nothing anyone could do about it.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng knew that he was quite close to his two senior fellow disciples, Augustus and Hallet, he had no intentions of going to the Gu Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The boy named Hallet carried the fishing rod on his shoulder and whistled. At this, the big cyan bull, which had been crawling on the side of the pond, slowly stood up and walked toward him. Hallet then jumped on the bull's back. "Take all the craps you've made and let's go from here," he shouted.</p>

  <p>Augustus was still pondering whether he should go find Zheng or not.</p>

  <p>When he saw Hallet jumping on the bull, he asked, "Where are we going?"</p>

  <p>"To the right place," Hallet said solemnly.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, saw Joy smiling at him when he got out of the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Joy also knew what Harold meant with his words.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling now, Zheng?" Joy asked. She wore a pretty smile which made her look quite attractive.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, I don't feel anything," Zheng said dully. Although he was a bit excited, he felt a bit depressed as well.</p>

  <p>He knew that his father's plan was working wonders as soon as he entered the divine land. He knew that he was indeed the most important person, around whom the whole plan was built. But the fact that he didn't know much about his father's plan saddened him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't expect Harold to say something like this. I'm afraid we have no choice but to change our initial plan," Joy said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>According to her plan, Zheng was expected to win consecutive victories in the Arena of Legends in order to earn a great deal of points for the Purple Soul Hall. This could help the Han Clan raise the ranking of its Floating Island.</p>

  <p>And with Zheng's current strength and progress, it was very likely that he could accomplish this feat.</p>

  <p>However, Harold gave a signal in his open battle against Rachelle and mentioned the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Although he also mentioned three other powerful clans, people were very likely to guess that Zheng was the anonymous man if he won a great deal of points.</p>

  <p>"But I am in an anonymous state, how on earth will they find out who I really am?" Zheng asked with a curious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Up until now, no one in the Hall of True Gods really found out his identity. Thus, he thought that he would be safe regardless.</p>

  <p>Joy gave a look at the Jade Wall of Legends on which the warriors' rankings kept changing. "When the points are being calculated, your points will go to Han Clan. Thus, they'd figure out who you really are," she explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then what are we supposed to do?" Zheng asked, his voice deep with concern.</p>

  <p>"Here is an idea," Joy said. "In the last match you can lose to Liusu."</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment. It was indeed a radical solution to transfer a great deal of points to Liusu. "But I need the points to get the treasure that is rewarded by the Han Clan," he said.</p>

  <p>"What treasure do you wish to acquire?" Joy asked with a smile. She thought of Zheng as a stubborn fellow. She knew that he wouldn't ask her for help even if he needed it desperately.</p>

  <p>It was quite true that Zheng didn't like asking for help, no matter how dire the circumstances were. He had no plans of asking Joy for help.</p>

  <p>"I want the Golden Beast Statue. After I accumulate enough points, I'm going to— " Joy interrupted Zheng midway through his speech and said,</p>

  <p>"Hold on." She gave her waist a sudden twist and disappeared.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later she reappeared, making her way towards Zheng. She had something in her hands.</p>

  <p>Clang! She threw the mysterious object in her hands on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue lay right in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>He looked at the statue with astonishment. It was as big as a fully-grown human being. He didn't expect Joy to fetch the statue just for him.</p>

  <p>Zheng examined the Golden Beast Statue. He had an intense awareness in his inner world again. The target of the consciousness of his inner world was the mud at the bottom of the Golden Beast Statue.</p>
