<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the heavenly essence could help the cyan dragon restore a fraction of his strength, there was only a little of this essence. There were too many scales on his body, and more than a hundred dragon scales only occupied a small section of him.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon noticed that piece of the flood dragon bone on the battlefield, he finally decided to communicate with Luo Luo Zheng. Usually, a cyan dragon hardly paid attention to a small part of the flood dragon's spine.</p>

  <p>As a genuine dragon, he thought the flood dragon was just a kind of beast many generations away from him. Therefore, there was not much genuine dragon blood within a flood dragon.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how little genuine dragon blood there was in a flood dragon, it would still help the cyan dragon, already too weak at this point, recover. Even a small amount of genuine dragon blood as a supplement could slowly restore the cyan dragon's strength.</p>

  <p>After swallowing the spine of the flood dragon, the cyan dragon finally regained strength and was able to communicate with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Did you just say this is the Killing Sword Mountain?</p>

  <p>Does this only exist in my mind?</p>

  <p>Why can't I pull out the sword stuck in this mountain?" Luo Luo Zheng fired the questions rapidly in a show of confusion. Since the cyan dragon knew what this mountain was, he must also be aware of the secret of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Haha! How is it possible that the Killing Sword Mountain exists only in your mind?</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain is a sacred place for practicing sword skills.</p>

  <p>It cannot belong to any one person. But it is almost dreamlike," the cyan dragon explained. Smiling gently, he went on, "There was a resonance between your soul's consciousness and the Killing Sword Mountain when you comprehended the consummation of the sword intent, and then you were chosen to practice in the mountain. It is an opportunity for you!</p>

  <p>And your opponent today, the boy named Tianming, must have gone for practice in another place, but I guess wherever that is, it cannot compare to yours here. The one who has the chance to be chosen into the Killing Sword Mountain is... Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Abruptly, the cyan dragon stopped what he was saying as he laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>As curious as he was, Luo Luo Zheng didn't dare ask the cyan dragon any more questions since it seemed he no longer wanted to say anything about the Killing Sword Mountain. What Luo Luo Zheng was most concerned about now was how to practice in the sacred mountain.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he thought of the question when the cyan dragon continued, "The Killing Sword Mountain is one of three sacred places for practicing sword skills. More than that, it is a way of practicing the killing sword skill! When the swordsman comprehends the consummate sword intent, there will be a slight chance for him to project his consciousness into the Killing Sword Mountain and have a contract with it. And what you need to do now is climb the mountain!</p>

  <p>Those swords under your feet? They are actually projections of weapons left by climbers who came before you. They are simply projections of other people's weapons, so of course, you can't pull them out!"</p>

  <p>Incredulous, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "All those swords were left by others?"</p>

  <p>Only then did he understand why he was unable to pull any of the metal blades embedded in the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to feel strange about that. The world is much bigger than you can imagine, and there are billions, no, trillions, of creatures practicing sword skills. Just as you have the chance to cultivate your skills in the Killing Sword Mountain, so do others. How high you can climb the mountain depends on your ability," the cyan dragon continued to speak in a calm tone.</p>

  <p>"Climb the mountain? That's easy!" Luo Luo Zheng said confidently.</p>

  <p>Although the Killing Sword Mountain's Mu Ning came out much too strong, it was only a mountain after all.</p>

  <p>Mocking laughter was followed by, "You can give it a try to test whether or not it's easy. But let me remind you that the higher you climb the Killing Sword Mountain, the more benefits you will reap. It's a rare opportunity for you, so you must take it!"</p>

  <p>Once the cyan dragon had finished speaking, he kept quiet, just waiting for Luo Zheng's performance.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's words were replayed in Luo Zheng's head. 'The higher I climb the mountain, the more benefits I will get.'</p>

  <p>Staring at the swords scattered on the mountain, Luo Luo Zheng arched an eyebrow, inhaled deeply, then took on the challenge. With the Streamer Sword in hand, he advanced towards the Killing Sword Mountain a step at a time.</p>

  <p>He had only taken two steps when a few low-grade mysterious weapons suddenly began to vibrate. Then to Luo Zheng's surprise, a handful of sword intents shot out from those very weapons and headed towards him.</p>

  <p>Several thoughts raced in Luo Zheng's mind as he tried to comprehend all that was happening.</p>

  <p>'These sword intents come from the masters of these low-grade mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>And they're at the marrow refining level?'</p>

  <p>He furrowed his brows in fascination.</p>

  <p>Based on what the cyan dragon just said, only those able to comprehend the consummate sword intent had the opportunity to practice on the Killing Sword Mountain. But at the same time, not every swordsman who fully understood the sword intent had the chance to get to this mountain!</p>

  <p>Because he comprehended the consummate sword intent when he was at grade two of the nature level, Luo Luo Zheng was considered talented enough, yet someone was even more skilled than the young disciple!</p>

  <p>How could any person understand the consummate sword intent at the marrow refining level?</p>

  <p>The thought was a great shock to Luo Luo Zheng. This kind of genius couldn't exist in the Eastern Region or even the Central Region, and for that matter, it was rare anywhere in the world!</p>

  <p>So it was truly unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Although unsettling, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't depressed by his discovery.</p>

  <p>'There is always something unfair in this world, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Using himself as an example, Luo Luo Zheng recalled he was imprisoned at age 15, while disciples from the noble clans had the privilege of taking pills, practicing tier 4 cultivation methods, and using spiritual weapons that even masters of ordinary families did not have.</p>

  <p>And yet, all of these warriors had been surpassed by Luo Luo Zheng by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>It took a very long time to practice and be a master in martial arts.</p>

  <p>Maybe it seemed inconceivable for Luo Luo Zheng to comprehend the consummate sword intent at the marrow refining level, yet there was no question that he was a man of great power. After all, he surpassed the descendants with great family backgrounds and supreme blood. They were born with gifts that others couldn't even imagine, while all Luo Luo Zheng had now was only enough for their meals.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Luo Zheng thought about all the inequity in the world, he didn't care about them one bit.</p>

  <p>Since he wasn't born to a family with a great background, he would try his very best to take everything he desired little by little!</p>

  <p>"Break into pieces!" Luo Luo Zheng shouted.</p>
