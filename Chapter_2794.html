  <p>
</p>

  <p>The eruption of the ice volcano had taken more than ten lives!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked. He looked around but couldn't find anyone else. Had everyone succumbed to the chill?</p>

  <p>Had Tianming also died?</p>

  <p>"Where are the others?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Although the cold air that was erupted from the ice volcano was horrifying, it only shot straight up into the sky and didn't spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Duh duh..."</p>

  <p>The woman slowly took a few steps forward and stopped at the edge of the mouth of the volcano. She pointed downward as she said, "Of course they are hiding there!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked over to her and looked in the direction she was pointing. The edge of the volcano mouth was very smooth.</p>

  <p>But there were huge grooves that were cut on the smooth walls of the volcano mouth.</p>

  <p>These grooves seemed to have been made by knives or swords. Although they were not large, every groove was big enough for over a hundred people to hide.</p>

  <p>Right now, Nicholas and the other Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods were all huddled together in a groove.</p>

  <p>Just now when they had climbed to the peak of the snow mountain, they had had no idea what was awaiting them. When they had looked around to check their surroundings, the snow mountain had suddenly trembled, and a cold stream of air had erupted from the bottom of the snow mountain!</p>

  <p>Everyone who had been near Nicholas was lucky. They had instantly rushed into a groove on the wall of the ice volcano and avoided the attack of the cold white air.</p>

  <p>However, some of the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods had not been so lucky. They had directly turned to ice and plunged to their deaths.</p>

  <p>The faces of the crowd in the groove were pale. The Abyss Demon Region was truly the most dangerous place. Sometimes, life or death was decided in a split second.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng and the woman showed up, Nicholas spotted them.</p>

  <p>"He is still alive!" There was a murderous look in Murphy's eyes.</p>

  <p>Although it was sometimes hard for him to even protect himself in this dangerous place, he still had a mad desire to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes also gleamed. He gently pressed the black ring on his thumb.</p>

  <p>His Spear of Supreme Harmony was hidden in this black ring. He was confident that if he used the Spear of Supreme Harmony, he would be able to kill Luo Zheng. After all, only he could use the spear to activate Grand Teleportation!</p>

  <p>However, he quickly suppressed the idea...</p>

  <p>After all, he knew that they were in a critical situation now. Nothing good would come out of killing him now.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really revealed his identity now, he would probably choose to attack Nicholas immediately.</p>

  <p>He had been suppressing this idea for so many years, but he had never found a suitable opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a complicated look in Tianming's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why is Luo Zheng with that woman? Is he also a clone?" Tianming naturally hoped that Luo Zheng would escape from the Abyss Demon Region safely.</p>

  <p>In Tianming's eyes, this woman was not easy to deal with...</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention lingered on Luo Zheng only for a moment. Right now, they were far more concerned about the crisis they were facing, as well as the whereabouts of the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>"You made us scout the way in the front while you followed behind like a lurking predator. What a great plan!" Nicholas said to the woman as cold air surged between them.</p>

  <p>Even though the cold air had whizzed up from the bottom of the mountain with a piercing sound, Nicholas' words could still be heard clearly.</p>

  <p>The woman looked down at Nicholas and sneered. "You came here all by yourselves. How can you blame it on me now? Even if I wasn't here, you would have still entered this place. Besides, I'm the one who cut these grooves. You should be thanking me, not blaming me. How awful!"</p>

  <p>She was the one who had manipulated Sword Chen's clones to perform the strikes in order to create the grooves on the walls inside the volcano.</p>

  <p>The ice volcano went down so deep that no one could see where it ended, and there were only small gaps between the bursts of chilly air that shot up to the sky.</p>

  <p>It was wishful thinking to think that one could reach the bottom of the ice volcano by taking advantage of the intervals. Finally, the woman had come up with the idea of using grooves.</p>

  <p>The grooves on the walls of the volcano could serve as a shelter to hide in when the volcano erupted. By hiding in these grooves, one could avoid the cold air.</p>

  <p>"Thank you? Just because you created some holes on the wall? I could do it too!" Clark cursed. Standing in the depth of the groove, he threw a hard punch at the ground.</p>

  <p>He had channeled quite a lot of power into the punch, too.</p>

  <p>However, the ground didn't budge even a little!</p>

  <p>"That's weird..."</p>

  <p>There was a flicker of surprise and displeasure in Clark's expression.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a dignified Holy Being. Even the famous mountains and great rivers in the divine land would have been shattered by his punch.</p>

  <p>Destroying mountains and rivers was a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>However, in the ice volcano, nothing had happened after he had thrown the punch. He could not explain it. It was as if all his strength had been absorbed by the mountain wall!</p>

  <p>Like the Demon Ice Sculpture, the ice mountain was not hurt at all. But then how had the woman cut these grooves?</p>

  <p>"If it were that easy to break the ice here, I'd have already obtained the True Demon Body a long time ago. Why would I have waited for you to come?"</p>

  <p>The woman pursed her lips with a hint of derision.</p>

  <p>She had racked her brains in order to figure out a way to reach the bottom of this ice volcano, and had finally chosen to create grooves on the walls!</p>

  <p>To accomplish it, more than 20, 000 of Sword Chen's clones had died...</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The sound of the chilly air blowing up from the bottom of the big volcano was getting louder and louder.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at them carefully and reminded them, "The cold air erupting from the ice volcano will pause soon. You can take that chance to rush into the next groove below. There will be enough time for you to achieve that!"</p>

  <p>By moving down from one groove to the next, one could reach the bottom of the volcano step by step.</p>

  <p>"Why should we listen to you? It's too dangerous here. Let's go up!"</p>

  <p>Jeremiah said with a frown.</p>

  <p>It was indeed too dangerous for them to stay in this narrow groove. And none of them wanted to move down and risk their lives.</p>

  <p>When the chill air that was erupting paused a little, they would naturally return to the mouth of the ice volcano and make further plans.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the woman smiled faintly and said, "Too bad, you can only go down. I'm blocking all your ways of retreat..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the over a dozen Holy Beings who had been standing behind the woman rose and floated toward the edge of the volcano mouth.</p>

  <p>They began to gather their internal momentum, giving off an overwhelming aura.</p>

  <p>"So you'd better go down now," the woman said with a beautiful smile.</p>

  <p>Nicholas took a deep breath when he saw his clone.</p>

  <p>The current situation was very dangerous, but it was even more unwise to fight with this woman at the volcano mouth. And fighting with those clones wasn't a good idea either.</p>

  <p>Now, the only choice they had was to move downward.</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas had to yield in such a situation.</p>
