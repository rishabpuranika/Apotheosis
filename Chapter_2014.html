<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique allowed warriors to instantly appear from one place to another in great distances.</p>

  <p>It was known that only warriors at the world lord level and above were fully able to grasp this technique. The use of this technique in battles between world lords or Supreme Lords often made it difficult for the warriors to kill their opponents, as it provided an escape.</p>

  <p>The warriors who were proficient in the Grand Teleportation technique were well aware that the so-called "Teleportation" wasn't as easy as it sounded.</p>

  <p>First, a normal space channel was needed. Then, it would use the Space Law to construct a path and fold the two ends of space together.</p>

  <p>The stronger the Space Law was, the higher the ratio of folding.</p>

  <p>The space channels of the great worlds could reduce a distance of a thousand miles to just ten miles, while the Upper World's space channels could reduce a ten-thousand-mile distance to just ten miles as well. Even more astonishing were the trans-border channels, for they could reduce a distance of a million miles to just ten miles.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique the Supreme Lords used was no different as it needed to create the same space channel as well. However, only a few people could use this space channel and it could not exist for long. It could only exist for several seconds or so, but it could reduce the distance of millions of miles to only a foot!</p>

  <p>To put it simply, a Supreme Lord who had executed the Grand Teleportation technique only needed to move one foot to cross millions of miles in reality.</p>

  <p>This teleportation didn't mean that they actually disappeared, but rather, they traversed millions of miles away at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>It was naturally impossible to even catch up to such an extreme speed.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if a Supreme Lord used it to escape in battle, the opponent would have to use the same technique to keep up as well.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ancestral Dragon's situation was a bit special. Its understanding of the Space Law had surpassed everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>It was true that Supreme Lord Korbin had successfully used the Grand Teleportation technique to escape. He should be able to get away from the Rosy Cloud World in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Never did he expect that, just when he had escaped into the space channel and started to move inside it, the Ancestral Dragon had suddenly dragged him out and bit him!</p>

  <p>Shock was written all over Zheng's and everyone else's faces. Supreme Lord Korbin looked equal parts surprised and enraged. He quickly set his thoughts aside and launched a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Yet, it was no use because the Ancestral Dragon had absorbed all of the Faith Energy in the two Pools of Faith. This present Ancestral Dragon was already a full grown adult and was terrifyingly strong. Supreme Lord Korbin fought fiercely and struggled, but the Ancestral Dragon had eventually swallowed him up.</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Korbin's demise, the heavens shook and roared.</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe had sensed the tremor at the same time. At that moment, they understood that a Supreme Lord had just passed away.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't exactly know who among their kind had died. Five Supreme Lords had died in the Evolutionary Universe in the last couple of years. Three of them belonged to the Humanity Alliance, and the other two were from two small races.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the number of Supreme Lords who had died in the last two decades had already surpassed ten. Such an event would've been quite unlikely back then.</p>

  <p>From that situation alone, it was safe to say that the entire Evolutionary Universe was undergoing a violent change.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon belched before it swayed its massive body like a pendulum. Then, it opened its mouth and coughed twice.</p>

  <p>Its guttural sound was as loud as a clap of thunder and as it continued to cough, cyan blue flames burst from its throat. It was clear that Supreme Lord Korbin had died a tragic death as he had struggled some more even after being swallowed.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin was known for his extremely powerful type of flames. The Ancestral Dragon continued to cough some more until the flames in its mouth decreased rapidly. However, it didn't seem to be gone completely.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the Ancestral Dragon roared in anger. It raised its head in a snap and opened wide its enormous mouth!</p>

  <p>The ground shook and trembled as the vibrations from the dragon's roar rippled in waves.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a red-hot demonic breath shot out from its mouth!</p>

  <p>The cyan smoke was a blend of the red hot embers and some traces of the cyan flames. However, the cyan flames didn't last long and were soon gone in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>After the Ancestral Dragon had purged all of the cyan flames from its body, it sighed in satisfaction and crouched down to the Inauguration Altar. Meanwhile, its burning breath continued to spread in the sky, leaving demonic red clouds that didn't dissipate for a long time.</p>

  <p>A nervous gulp rolled down Supreme Lord Shadow's throat as he watched the scene, followed by a chill that ran down his spine. Even he, a Supreme Lord, was in awe of the colossal dragon.</p>

  <p>Just then, Xun's gaze drifted to Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Supreme Lord Korbin was much stronger than Supreme Lord Shadow. While the latter had good assassination skills, his strength had been greatly reduced because of the Death Chain that bound him with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn now," Xun said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>It was now her time to purge. She had just learned about the current situation from Luo Zheng and knew that the Demon Night race was in dire need of powerful warriors. Even though a Supreme Lord's value varied from race to race, Xun did not intend to spare Supreme Lord Shadow's life anyway.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Death Chain wouldn't break if Supreme Lord Shadow didn't die. Luo Zheng couldn't just be linked to him forever.</p>

  <p>"Please spare my life, my queen!" Supreme Lord Shadow pleaded.</p>

  <p>He was so desperate that he had completely collapsed in despair. At that moment, he was no longer the dignified Supreme Lord that he once was.</p>

  <p>However, Xun remained impassive. Her state of mind was as cold and hard as ice.</p>

  <p>She had reflected on her past life countless times back when she was still hidden in Zheng's body. Now, she decided that she would no longer show mercy except for Luo Zheng for the rest of her life.</p>

  <p>As Xun held her Saint Killing Spear and slowly approached, Supreme Lord Shadow still didn't give up begging her, "Please have mercy on me, my queen. I swear that I will do everything I can to protect the Demon Night race, and I won't regret even if I die for the sake of our race..."</p>

  <p>"Oh really?" Her lips stretched into a thin smile. She looked immensely charming, but Supreme Lord Shadow could feel nothing but fear.</p>

  <p>"Please give me a chance to turn over a new leaf. There is no basis for my words, so I will swear with my will of martial arts..." Before he even began to speak, Xun's Saint Killing Spear had already started to spin, and a spear shadow was headed straight towards him.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice, he quickly hid himself in the shadows with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Dance!"</p>

  <p>A cloud of black shadows appeared and swarmed Supreme Lord Shadow until his whole body was completely concealed, and his Mu Ning had dissipated.</p>

  <p>Once he was gone, the black cloud actually moved towards Xun.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow wailed desperately and made a split-second decision to attack.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Dance was one of Supreme Lord Shadow's most powerful concealment abilities. Theoretically speaking, no one in the entire universe would be able to track him if he used such an attack.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, things were made more complicated because he was bound by the Death Chain that exposed his every move.</p>

  <p>"Hmph," Xun simply snorted.</p>

  <p>She suddenly accelerated her pace and surprisingly did not dodge the cloud of black shadows when she charged straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Just then, the others who were present heard several piercing sounds.</p>

  <p>Fresh blood splattered everywhere and painted everything it touched red.</p>

  <p>When the black shadows were gone, Xun slowly returned with the Saint Killing Spear in her hand. Supreme Lord Shadow froze on the spot with his eyes wide open as three fist-sized holes appeared on his heart, stomach, and the center of his chest.</p>

  <p>Right after, the heavens shook violently once more.</p>

  <p>Another Supreme Lord had died.</p>

  <p>The Death Chain that bound Supreme Lord Shadow and Luo Zheng together dissipated when the Supreme Lord was no more.</p>

  <p id="top_8"><a id="p11197" class="calibre2"></a>It was only then when Luo Zheng had finally regained his freedom.</p>

  <p>A relieved sigh escaped his lips and he returned the Death Chain to his space ring. Although the Death Chain was a valuable treasure, it had its disadvantages. He could've just escaped right now if it wasn't for the light band that bound him to his opponent. Therefore, he realized that he had to think twice the next time he thought about using it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Xun turned to face Yao and Ying this time.</p>

  <p>"You are controlled by the Soul-sealing Needles. The crimes that you have committed against the Demon Night race can't be blamed on you,"</p>

  <p>Xun said.</p>

  <p>However, Yao couldn't help but snort coldly at her words. "So what?</p>

  <p>Even if I wasn't controlled by the Soul-sealing Needle, I wouldn't spare your life as well," she said.</p>

  <p>"I know. It's why I'm not letting you go," Xun shot back as her eyes glowed red.</p>

  <p>The grudges she and Yao held against each other didn't really involve the Soul-sealing Needle. It was just that Xun was self-righteous to a point that she chose to tell right from wrong.</p>
