<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Saul's body had been created by the first owner of the fairy palace. He wouldn't go through the Five Aging Processes, and his body would not break. In other words, even if he wanted to kill himself, he wouldn't be able to do so. His soul was tightly sealed within, making it impossible for him to disperse his own soul.</p>

  <p>For Saul, guarding the fairy palace was a rather boring task. Dying was an extravagant hope for him.</p>

  <p>If only someone stayed in the fairy palace, it would be so good for him.</p>

  <p>All the previous owners had attempted to take control of the fairy palace, but all of them had failed. Saul had even hoped for the return of Immortal Mist, but in the end he also died because of the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng was slowly gaining control of the fairy palace. Not only had he obtained the token of water, he had even managed to get the token of mountain.</p>

  <p>"Carry the fairy palace around with me? Is the fairy palace movable?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Saul nodded. "The token of mountain is the most special one of the six tokens. It is the projection of this fairy palace, and is equivalent to the entrance. You can regard it as the fairy palace itself. As long as you have the token, you can return to the fairy palace at any time you want." It seemed like Saul was in a good mood. "You can also treat the fairy palace as this woman's Sky Purple Body and the token as a space node," he explained, pointing at Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is," Luo Zheng remarked. This way, if he wanted to return to the fairy palace in the future, he wouldn't need to travel tens of thousands of miles to get to the Eastern Region. He could do so with the token of mountain in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to continue?" Saul asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already obtained two tokens in a short period of time, but this time he chose to give up.</p>

  <p>In the next stage of the test, a large group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors would probably appear. Although Luo Zheng could completely transfer all the attacks faced by him, the problem was that the Magnetic Sacred Mountain also had a limit to its carrying capacity. If a large group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors used the fifth layer of any Original Law, their power would become unimaginably strong.</p>

  <p>If the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was destroyed, the overflowing power would probably damage the foundation of the entire great world. Luo Zheng was not willing to take this risk. Besides, now that he had the token of mountain, he could wait for his strength to increase and then return to the fairy palace in the future to obtain the other tokens.</p>

  <p>He still had the token of water in his hand. He smiled and said, "Then, can we head to the library now?"</p>

  <p>"No problem," Saul said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed, and he asked, "Can others also enter?" He was naturally referring to Ning Yudie and the others.</p>

  <p>"Possessing any token is equivalent to being the owner of the fairy palace. It's up to you to decide whether or not they can enter the library,"</p>

  <p>Saul said.</p>

  <p>"Got it!"</p>

  <p>Previously, although Luo Zheng was considered to be the owner of the fairy palace, he couldn't control anything. The token of wind was at most just a ticket into the fairy palace, and the token of thunder gave him the right to challenge the True Path.</p>

  <p>Now that he had the tokens of water and mountain, his mastery over the fairy palace was growing more and more. Someday, he would be able to acquire the other four tokens, and even the tokens of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>So everyone turned around and began to walk back. However, when they were halfway there, a violent and savage Mu Ning suddenly erupted from the depths of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange cry was heard.</p>

  <p>Even though it was at a great distance, the vicious Mu Ning was abnormally terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face fell while Yudie's was as pale as a sheet. As for Mu Ning and Mu Ning, they fainted on the spot.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Luo Zheng asked Saul as he helped Mu Ning up while Ning Yudie went to support Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The evil Mu Ning was not released from the front. Moreover, it was quite far from Luo Zheng. However, it shocked and terrified him. One can imagine just how dangerous that thing must be.</p>

  <p>Saul's expression changed. He then said, "Looks like someone is getting impatient."</p>

  <p>"Where did that sound come from?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The dog house," Saul replied simply. "Luo Zheng, now that you've obtained the token of water, you can go to the library yourself. I'll just go take a look inside now."</p>

  <p>Not waiting for Zheng's answer Saul flew straight to the depths of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>There was an exquisite backyard in the depths of the fairy palace. And a ferocious beast was tied with a chain in a corner of the backyard. The beast was on the ground, not moving at all.</p>

  <p>Saul walked towards the beast expressionlessly and asked, "What are you so anxious about?"</p>

  <p>Roar! The beast's voice was softer this time, but its head was still facing the deep pit.</p>

  <p>"Are the guys in the prison being naughty again?" Saul walked towards the deep pit. In it was a row of fences, and underneath these fences was absolute darkness.</p>

  <p>Saul yelled into the pit, "You've endured so many years. Why are you being so impatient now?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>Saul continued to speak. "The young man's talent is very strong, and his luck is not bad either. He has actually obtained four tokens. The important thing is that he has the tokens of mountain and water. In the future, he might even be able to get the tokens of heaven and earth."</p>

  <p>There was pin-drop silence in the deep pit.</p>

  <p>"I know you're not optimistic, but this time it might really be different.</p>

  <p>You have already waited for so many years. Believe me, you will only have to wait for a thousand years at the most. For you, this amount of time is nothing! Just be a little more patient," said Saul trying to encourage them.</p>

  <p>Seeing that there was no response, Saul was ready to leave. However, just as he turned away, he heard a voice from the pit saying, "Then call him in. I'll teach him. I promise it won't take a thousand years. A hundred years is enough. After that, he will be the strongest warrior in the whole universe. He will beat the shit out of those Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>Saul didn't turn back around; he just stood there. He shook his head and said, "Master's rules cannot be broken. If he can't obtain the tokens of heaven and earth, then he can't enter this place."</p>

  <p>With that, he left the backyard.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man with long, straggly hair was sitting next to the fences in the deep pit. He looked up indifferently and muttered, "Even if I have to wait for a hundred million years, I won't complain. A thousand years is nothing. But the problem is, I'm afraid the monsters in the lower level of the prison can't wait any longer."</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng have known what was going on?</p>

  <p>He and Ning Yudie revived Mu Ning and Mu Ning, and gave them some pills to calm themselves. Only then did they head towards the library.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the gate to the library was inordinately tall. Luo Zheng raised his head, but it was hard to see the top of the door frame.</p>

  <p>"Can I open the gate by just using the token of water?" Luo Zheng took out the token of water, and the moment he did so, a golden light flashed from the top to the bottom of the gate. With a muffled sound, the entire gate revealed a crack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sprang into action and attempted to push open the gate. The gate looked as tall as a mountain, and Luo Zheng thought that it would take much effort on his part to push open the gate. However, the gate opened just with a light touch, and the scent of books wafted up his nose.</p>

  <p>Books don't have a natural fragrance of their own. Surely the books in the library must be made from special wood pulp. Countless years later, the natural fragrance was still intact. It was an intoxicating smell.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Luo Zheng smiled at Ning Yudie. He was the first to enter the library.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, Mu Ning, and Mu Ning followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Even after being shut for countless years, the library was still free from dust. In front of Luo Zheng stood bookshelves that were comparable to small mountains. As for the books on these bookshelves, each of them was thirty feet tall and twenty feet wide.</p>

  <p>"How can I read them?" Luo Zheng looked miserable when he saw such huge books.</p>
