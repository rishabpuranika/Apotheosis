  <p>
</p>

  <p>The downgrader made his debut from the black light.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng knew that this black light was essential to the downgrader.</p>

  <p>His real body was most likely hidden within it.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had attempted to destroy the black light with the Destruction Extreme Form, but in the end, he only failed.</p>

  <p>Now that he realized his attacks couldn't hurt the downgrader even the slightest bit, he once again fixed his attention on the black light.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to destroy the black light just by relying on the Destruction Extreme Form; however, Luo Zheng discovered a token in Clarence's memories.</p>

  <p>"Light Clearing Skill!"</p>

  <p>A circular ring of light floated towards the black light and enveloped it, now beginning to rotate.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the ring of light revolved, the black light also swayed non-stop.</p>

  <p>"Is it taking effect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng observed as his eyelids twitched slightly.</p>

  <p>He had tried several other methods before, but none of them could affect the black light even a little. The black light seemed to be in another world.</p>

  <p>Now, the Light Clearing Skill could actually impact the black light, which brought Luo Zheng a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>"Contract!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The ring of light then contracted inward from its rotating motion.</p>

  <p>The moment the edge of the ring of light touched the black light, the black light shrunk slightly and surprisingly freed itself from the ring of light's control.</p>

  <p>"The black light escaped?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and pointed at it with his finger. He deployed the Light Clearing Skill once more.</p>

  <p>One hundred rings.</p>

  <p>One thousand rings.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand rings.</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand rings of light continuously appeared, all rotating and contracting at the same time. The black light started to shake violently, but without any further effect from the rings.</p>

  <p>"You're really stupid, aren't you? Instead of putting up a fight, you actually want to destroy my Source Light." The downgrader suddenly appeared above Luo Zheng's head. He had already dealt with the energy flow released by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his hands and stared at the downgrader without saying anything. He then drew his hands closer to the black light. Fingernail-sized crystals started to float out from his palms, gathering towards the black light.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>With a faint shattering sound, the small crystals merged into the black light.</p>

  <p>One by one, the crystals emitted a small dull green light as they broke.</p>

  <p>Soon, the black light was entirely colored green, and at the same time, turned into a solid object.</p>

  <p>This was another way of changing the shape and form of light.</p>

  <p>After the crystals had solidified the black light, Luo Zheng immediately yanked his fist and punched it forcefully.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The solidified black light was smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, the broken black light remained floating in its place.</p>

  <p>The downgrader, standing with crossed arms, didn't have any intention of attacking Luo Zheng at all. Instead, his eyes flashed with a faint yellow light as he showed a mocking expression.</p>

  <p>There were a great number of theurgies in Clarence's memories, all of which had been extracted from the Extreme Form energies. Many of them were indeed worth a try.</p>

  <p>Every time that Luo Zheng did, he looked at the downgrader and observed his reaction. Not a single token was able to make the downgrader flinch.</p>

  <p>His face stayed plain and unbothered.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng failed six or seven times in a row, the quiet Clarence finally broke his silence. "It's useless, Luo Zheng. The Source Light is the privilege I gave him. It can't be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Privilege?" Luo Zheng was stunned as he heard what Clarence just said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Before he grew up, he had made this request, which was the privilege of never being destroyed. I thought carefully for a long time before I came up with this method. After I gave the Source Light to him, even I could not strip him off his power," Clarence recollected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed as he was lost for words.</p>

  <p>Clarence himself had actually created a powerful enemy who couldn't be killed. What was he thinking?</p>

  <p>"Since the Source Light can't be destroyed, how did you deal with him?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked again, deeply thinking of a solution.</p>

  <p>From the higher-grade worlds all the way to the lower-grade worlds, Clarence chased Mastema and later got defeated in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>"Suppress him to the point that he can't get out of the Source Light anymore," Clarence replied. "Every time I suppressed him in the Source Light, he could not bear it and would begin to downgrade the worlds, which I couldn't stop him from doing. In the fifth-grade world, we had both suffered great losses. He failed to complete the downgrading while I had to stay in the Heavenly Ring Staff."</p>

  <p>"But we have the same energy and neither of us can do anything to each other. How can I even suppress him?" Luo Zheng asked with hesitation.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, Clarence responded, "In my opinion, not only would you fail to suppress him, but you will eventually lose to him."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Up to now, he hasn't even used his real strength. He and I know much more about energy than you do. Although you have absolute infinite energy, you're like a reckless man flailing a powerful saber around. Your skill is undoubtedly great, yet it is useless," Clarence commented harshly.</p>

  <p>If the downgrader heard those words that Clarence uttered, he would probably raise his thumbs in agreement.</p>

  <p>However, it was not Luo Zheng's fault.</p>

  <p>Even though he had obtained a portion of Clarence's memories, he had no other choice but to fall inferior to the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"Then you..."</p>

  <p>"No. I won't make a move," Clarence said, immediately predicting what Luo Zheng was thinking. "I've already told you the reason."</p>

  <p>Clarence had never been able to stop Mastema from downgrading the worlds, so he quit and had simply given up trying.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity to give up like this. After all..."</p>

  <p>"Remember, human," Clarence directly interrupted Luo Zheng again. "I've already helped you understand my past to the greatest extent. As a human, you have your limits and you know it. It's meaningless to encourage me, persuade me, or even urge me. I have already given everything to you.</p>

  <p>This time, you have to strive for success on your own."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking his truth frankly, Clarence fell silent again.</p>

  <p>No matter how many times Luo Zheng called him, he didn't reply anymore. He had already made up his mind to just be an onlooker.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, we can only rely on no one but ourselves now," the ancestry-level bloodline suddenly told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Clarence had awakened, he hadn't erased the intelligence of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Rely on ourselves..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes slightly while gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>"You're right. Come on!"</p>

  <p>This time, the ancestry-level bloodline released vigorous life energy which was the bloodline power of the life quadrant.</p>

  <p>The bloodline powers of the fourth-grade world could not offer any substantial help to Luo Zheng, but they offered him great comfort that made him feel a little warm inside.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the voice of the downgrader suddenly echoed again.</p>

  <p>"I have given you so many chances, but you chose not to seize even one of them. Now let's end this boring battle!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader then stretched out his long and slender arms.</p>

  <p>Several Extreme Form energies started to circulate on the surface of his body, which later intertwined and merged together? this formed fat leeches that slowly crawled all around his body.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, the downgrader came flying straight to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng instantly avoided him by using his omnipotent power to move to the corner of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>However, the strange thing was that the downgrader also arrived at the spot at the same time. His slender arms had already grabbed Luo Zheng's neck, and the leeches that originally lay on his body transferred quickly to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>One end of the leeches drilled into Luo Zheng's body, and the other remained stuck to the body of the downgrader, connecting the two to each other.</p>

  <p>"It's such a waste to give you the ancestry-level bloodline, don't you think? Why don't you leave it to me instead?" the downgrader said with an evil smirk.</p>
