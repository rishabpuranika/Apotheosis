<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2889 The Ruler And The Will </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings was emerging? Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>Mike clenched his hand, around which cyan wisps of the internal momentum of the Evolution Godly Way, were constantly rotating.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to infer what was unknown. Even Mike couldn't predict the real intentions of the Infinity Ruler. He could only make an educated guess.</p>

  <p>After the cyan wisps around his hand converged to a point, Mike said cautiously, "It should be because of the Infinity Ruler. It is pointing in the direction of the Mountain of Holy Beings. It seems that Bromley was worrying too much."</p>

  <p>Bromley was the only one who had ever entered the maze in the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, he had failed to figure out the secret of the maze, because he could not find his way out of it.</p>

  <p>Even after leaving the Mountain of Holy Beings, Bromley had kept thinking of the maze, so much so that, with his amazing memory, he had copied the entire maze on the True Path.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that the Infinity Ruler isn't merely leading us to the Mountain of Holy Beings?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. "It's very likely that it's leading us to the exit of the maze."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes burned with passion when he heard his father's words.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was waiting for him at the end of the maze, but it didn't stop him from making all kinds of conjectures. In his eyes, Chiyou wouldn't have given something useless to his mother.</p>

  <p>In the north of the Time Sea in the middle of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Under the constant vibration, the waves in the Time Sea turned turbulent.</p>

  <p>All the Sun Blind people who were sailing in the Time Sea immediately ducked. They stretched out their hands and feet to stabilize their boats as much as possible and ensure that they wouldn't be overturned by the waves in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>There was an endless plain in the north of the Time Sea. Now, a crack appeared in the center of that plain.</p>

  <p>It was noon, and the sunlight fell from the sky straight into the crack, from which silver radiance was reflected.</p>

  <p>The vibration in the area became more and more intense, and it seemed as if a huge monster was about to spring out of the crack.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Finally, a pointed mountain peak shot out of the crack and rapidly rose. In no time, a huge silver mountain body was visible above the plain. The crack in the plain was expanding to accommodate the size of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, the huge mountain was finally released from the crack, but it continued rising until it hovered several hundred feet above the ground.</p>

  <p>The whole mountain was now floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the powerful clans promptly left their Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>They flew over to the plain and, from high up in the sky, looked at the silver mountain below with surprise on their faces.</p>

  <p>They were all completely at a loss for what was happening in front of them.</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings appears in advance?" a Holy Being of the Bai Clan said in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Just a short time earlier," Murphy said, gazing at the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings always appears on time. There has been no change in this for so many divine eras. Why has it come ahead of schedule this time?" said Zeke as he turned around to look at the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings had never been affected by things happening on the outside. It was common knowledge that the mountain was buried under the ground at the north of the Time Sea and would ascend every now and then to select new Holy Beings. Once they were selected, the mountain would return underground.</p>

  <p>Once, a Holy Being had gone to the plain and dug the ground in an attempt to enter the mountain, but he had come to a miserable end. If it had not been for his universe, he would have died once and for all.</p>

  <p>Since then, no one had ever dared to try and enter the Mountain of Holy Beings in an unconventional way.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying it's because of the Yellow Emperor Guards?" Clark asked.</p>

  <p>It had been a while since the Yellow Emperor Guards had entered the Time Sea, but no one knew what they were doing in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, even from afar, they could feel the strong malicious aura emitting from that place.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards had overpowered all the Holy Beings and forced them to join the alliance of the powerful clans and submit to Samuel.</p>

  <p>Although the Holy Beings did not dare to disobey the Yellow Emperor Guards, they hadn't done any of these things wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>"That's the only reasonable explanation." Zeke was very sure about his guess.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the Mountain of Holy Beings was always a significant event for the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>The powerful clans weren't the only ones who concerned themselves with it.</p>

  <p>There were a large number of first-tier clans in the divine land that had Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods among them.</p>

  <p>Anyone who was selected to be a Holy Being by the Mountain of Holy Beings would possibly be able to lead his or her clan to join the Floating Islands. This was the ultimate dream of every clan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Hall of Holy Beings, Hamish, Zavier, Salim, and Lorcan were gathered.</p>

  <p>Half of the over thirty teeth of the Sea Cracking Skull were shining with blood lights.</p>

  <p>Every time Zavier attacked a central divine city, he could feed over a million people to the skull, which greatly increased the speed.</p>

  <p id="top_4">But this time, there was a surprisingly cautious expression on Leyton's face.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, you're overthinking things! It's not a big deal that the Mountain of Holy Beings has appeared in advance. Don't think too much about it!"</p>

  <p>Zavier urged.</p>

  <p>Leyton fixed his sparkling eyes on Hamish and said, "Hamish once tried to break into the Mountain of Holy Beings and explore the secrets in it, but in the end, he gained nothing."</p>

  <p>Hamish made a bow of acknowledgment to Leyton. "Yes. I was seriously injured and had to spend many years healing my wounds. I'm afraid even you can't break into the Mountain of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"Even the restriction in the outer layer of the divine land was unable to keep us out, but the Mountain of Holy Beings easily blocks us. The things hidden within the mountain are very likely to be the original will of world," Leyton said, squinting his eyes.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Source World cultivated the Grand World Cultivation Method, so they were familiar with secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>The universes, the inner worlds, and the divine land that Chiyou had built using extraordinary theurgies needed to be ruled by will.</p>

  <p>In normal cases, the rulers of the worlds would always exist. True Gods were usually the rulers of their own inner worlds. When they died, they would cease to be the rulers because their inner worlds would die along with them.</p>

  <p>However, in this vast chaos, accidents often occurred.</p>

  <p>For example, sometimes a ruler's soul would vanish but their body would remain. In that case, their inner world would still exist, but it would be left without a ruler.</p>

  <p>This would give rise to two possibilities. One, if a strong being in the inner world noticed that the ruler had disappeared, they could then take the position of the ruler and even control the ruler's body. However, such a situation was rarely seen as the beings of an inner world were seldom that smart. It was very uncommon for beings to realize the death of their rulers.</p>

  <p>The second possibility was the awakening of the will of the inner world.</p>

  <p>The will would appear to replace the original ruler of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Mike had been half-dead for so many years that his inner world was slowly beginning to awaken. However, his universe was already well-prepared.</p>

  <p>When the will was awakened, it would merge with Zheng's body. Then, Zheng would be an immortal in that universe and could calmly control it to resist all attacks for Mike.</p>
