<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3207 Warrior Of The Stone Hill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The stone statue's right hand was so frighteningly powerful that the space in front of Luo Zheng bent out of shape.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" Luo Zheng was knocked back for dozens of feet from the massive force.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>It looked as though he was wiping the ground with his entire body as he continued to be swept away from the impact, leaving a ditch in front of him before he finally crashed into a huge building.</p>

  <p>The building was called the Sword Bearing Hall. It was a dwelling built explicitly for the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace to cultivate sword skills.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate events caused an imperfection in the form of a large hole on the wall of the Sword Bearing Hall!</p>

  <p>"What just happened?"</p>

  <p>"Who dares to fight in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>Apparently, the commotion happening outside had distracted the direct descendants from practicing in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.</p>

  <p>Most of them paused their practice to come out and make sense of what they just heard. As a result, their jaws dropped to the floor when their eyes fell on the broken wall, and the tiles piled up on the ground.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge scoffed at the ruins and rolled her eyes indifferently. She had full faith Luo Zheng wouldn't get back up from that attack. If anything, she thought he was dead.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to say a word till she saw it for herself, Lady Concubine Yan remained quiet and kept her gaze fixed at the ruins. A few seconds after, she noticed something that made her gasp.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Minor turbulence could be seen coming from the pile of tiles as they shook noticeably. A huge boulder about ten feet wide was flipped over by a black hand as a black figure emerged from the ruins.</p>

  <p>Curious at the sudden appearance of a man cloaked with black substance around his body, Feng Ge squinted her eyes to focus on his direction. She was shocked to see it was Luo Zheng, who now wiped the debris off his shoulders and cracked his knuckles as if unfazed by her move.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token she possessed was called the Warrior of the Stone Hill.</p>

  <p>The Stone Hill race had deep ancient roots.</p>

  <p>Similar to the legendary "Stone God," they would grow in the form of rocks. When they'd reach the age they matured in, they would emerge from the rocks.</p>

  <p>The strong warriors from that race were called the Warriors of the Stone Hill.</p>

  <p>In search of this Other Shore Token, the Taiyi Heaven Palace had dug out an entire mountain in Stage Thirteen. It took them several decades to do so.</p>

  <p>It was a descending type of Other Shore Token, which was extremely powerful because it had the potential to evolve further. The "Warrior of the Stone Hill" could further upgrade itself to the "Saint of the Stone Hill." The day it happened, the power of it would multiply by dozens!</p>

  <p>To attain that ascension in power, Feng Ge had to get to the Stone Hill Temple on Stage Twenty-two. However, she had a ways to go yet.</p>

  <p>Even with the current level of her Other Shore Token, Feng Ge's single attack had exceeded 600 Jun of force!</p>

  <p>That kind of power was way beyond her physical strength, so it was borne by the Other Shore Token itself. How come Luo Zheng resisted an attack of that intensity and took no damage?</p>

  <p>The black layer of Shade Stone cloaking Luo Zheng's body began to dissipate from his skin, and permeated into his bones from his pores. Once it disappeared completely, Luo Zheng regained his usual appearance.</p>

  <p>He never imagined Feng Ge would play so rough and prove to be a nuisance.</p>

  <p>What more could he expect from a direct descendant like her!</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng did not intend to stand down from this fight.</p>

  <p>He could compromise on many things without caring about them, but letting his women bear the pain for him wasn't one of them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Securely gripping the Snow Sword in his hands, he pointed the end in her direction as if to challenge her. Swiftly, he took one step back to gain momentum and pushed himself forward, he dashed towards Feng Ge once more.</p>

  <p>The mysterious movements of the Snow Sword made it tough to foretell the direction of the attack. When Luo Zheng got halfway through to her, the sword's actions became as fast as lightning. They were hard to be seen through the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword morphed itself into dazzling flashes of light that all shot towards Feng Ge vengefully from all directions.</p>

  <p>"Pathetic!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge spited at him as she raised her hand and shook it slightly.</p>

  <p>She opened up a space ring, from which long swords shot out one after the other.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With its fifteen left hands outstretched, the Warrior of the Stone Hill reached out and grabbed those long swords coming from the space ring.</p>

  <p>Now armed with fifteen long swords in its fifteen hands, Feng Ge's Other Shore Token looked more frightening than ever.</p>

  <p>"Slash at him now!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pointed towards the light shooting through Luo Zheng's sword and commanded her Other Shore Token dominantly.</p>

  <p>At her wish, the fifteen armed hands slashed vigorously at Luo Zheng in frantic movements. They moved swiftly and even overlapped with each other, but there was not a single collision between them. Each attack had precision and accuracy!</p>

  <p>From their rapid continuous movements, the swords formed a silver shield to deflect any attack and keep Feng Ge out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>"Cling! Cling! Cling!"</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship was formidable, it still failed to break through the silver curtain that protected her.</p>

  <p>Even so, he had no plans on backing down, as the speed of the sword in his hands grew gradually. It became faster and faster!</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! The swords are moving too fast!"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe Feng Ge has progressed again!"</p>

  <p>"Who is this guy, and why is he challenging someone like Feng Ge? He doesn't seem to be like one of us."</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace discussed among themselves without keeping their eyes off of the intense scene.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was the youngest of the direct descendants, despite that she had the most potential. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was quite fond of her. Due to that, they never dared underestimate her skills.</p>

  <p>On many occasions, she had proven herself to have talents beyond the reach of her peers. She was always ahead of them. Even without the aid of her Other Shore Token, she could easily beat any of them in battle.</p>

  <p>"Nice sword shield, but I wouldn't count on it to protect me if I were you!"</p>

  <p>A confident smirk appeared on Luo Zheng's face as one corner of his mouth tilted upwards. He continued his relentless attacks to break his way through.</p>

  <p>Not holding back, he charged fearlessly into the sword curtain guarding her.</p>

  <p>Before he made his way through it, the black layer on his skin appeared once more and covered his entire body up like armor.</p>

  <p>"Cling! Cling! Cling!"</p>

  <p>One after another, the long swords rained down on Luo Zheng, but failed to pierce through his body. It was like he was made up of pure iron!</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng draw closer with every passing second, Feng Ge felt slightly panicked.</p>

  <p>Taking caution to the situation, she began to move backward gracefully as if gliding on the surface of the water. Stalling for time before she could make her move, she kept retreating to keep Luo Zheng in the sword curtain.</p>

  <p>"Cling! Cling! Cling!"</p>

  <p>Within just ten seconds, the swords had hit Luo Zheng tens of thousands of times!</p>

  <p>However, his movements remained quick. There was no hint of staggering or injury on his body.</p>

  <p>Having witnessed this incredible spectacle, the spectators were rendered speechless. Each of their jaws had made their home on the floor as they stood there rooted to the ground.</p>

  <p>These direct descendants from the Taiyi Mountain received a better education than the ordinary people, and they had had their fair share of experiences. However, nothing compared to what they were observing just now.</p>

  <p>Was that body covered in black substance still human?</p>

  <p>Feng Ge kept at her attempts on retreating, but Luo Zheng was faster.</p>

  <p>He finally caught up to her and managed to pass through the sword curtain!</p>

  <p>With a determined look on her face, she raised her right hand. As if to mimic her gestures, the Warrior of the Stone Hill raised its right hand as well and aimed for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng was resilient enough to withstand the sword curtain, Feng Ge was sure he couldn't survive the Warrior of the Stone Hill!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>With quick action, the Warrior of the Stone Hill launched its attack on Luo Zheng with its right hand. It wanted to smash Luo Zheng like a bothersome insect.</p>

  <p>The strength held by the enormous palm apparently reached a specific limit.</p>

  <p>Anything that came under it would be reduced to little silver dust.</p>

  <p>"Look at that! It's unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>At the sight of the large palm, Luo Zheng prepared himself. He tightened his jaw and twisted his face while he drew massive power from his Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?"</p>

  <p>"The power of the Warrior of the Stone Hill reaches the limit of the Lust World! He doesn't stand a chance!"</p>

  <p>"The ultimate force should exceed 1, 000 Jun! This is suicide!</p>

  <p>Is he going to get smashed under it?"</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace shared pitiful looks as they found out that Luo Zheng refused to move from his spot and wanted to take the Warrior of the Stone Hill head-on. To them, he was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood straight as he composed himself. The Other Shore Power he had gathered from the Strength God Totem was ready. With a determined look on his face, he dashed to hit the gigantic palm falling down on him.</p>
