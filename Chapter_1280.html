<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each of the books was thirty feet tall standing upright, and the entire bookshelf in itself was basically a mountain, standing at least ten thousand feet tall. There were roughly three hundred or so rows in a single bookshelf. So all in all, the books must have numbered in tens of thousands just on a bookshelf.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the massive books seemed to have begun being dumped from the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>With each book's weight equal to that of a mountain range, the huge crashes were rather horrifying!</p>

  <p>Holding out his hand, Immortal Book caught a few that were crashing down. Still, he couldn't support them all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Knowing that they had to move quickly, Luo Zheng grabbed Mu Ning and retreated with Ning Yudie, Immortal Book, and Saul following after.</p>

  <p>By the time they escaped, the entire bookshelf was empty— all the books were strewn about the floor, piled up into a mountain.</p>

  <p>"Idiot! I told you there was something wrong with your method!" Saul shook his head in frustration.</p>

  <p>For a moment, all Immortal Book could do was stare at the scene before them in silence. Finally, he opened his mouth and said, "No, that's not the case."</p>

  <p>"What is it, then?" Saul returned, rolling his eyes at Immortal Book. The latter was in charge of the library, but it hadn't been opened for several years. Given what just happened, Saul was convinced that he was merely incompetent, having blown his chance after Luo Zheng finally got the library open.</p>

  <p>"I can hear these books," Immortal Book muttered. "All of the cultivation methods should be suitable for Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>The words shocked Saul almost speechless. "Impossible!"</p>

  <p>All warriors had their strengths and weaknesses, without exception.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng first comprehended the Law Power, he was rather good at the Space Law, and then the others, most especially after the baptism by laws. Still, it had to be impossible for him to attract all the books on the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>Some of the cultivation methods were not divided by attributes, nor did they require warriors' comprehension of the laws— some cultivation methods only required a certain level of the soul.</p>

  <p>There could only be one explanation— Luo Zheng was extremely balanced in every aspect and simply didn't have any weakness.</p>

  <p>But even so, it was unheard of to attract such a large volume of cultivation methods. Even with no weakness, he would stand out in only certain aspects. The method Immortal Book used was to pick out the cultivation method that suited Luo Zheng the most— not all of them could be suitable to him.</p>

  <p>But no matter how baffled the others were, the truth was as such— the method used to find Zheng's most suitable cultivation method had caused such a disaster.</p>

  <p>While the two bickered, Luo Zheng walked straight toward the mountain of books with a bitter smile on his face. "Which book should I get?" he asked.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "Don't bite off more than you can chew." Luo Zheng was well aware of this. Immortal Book's method of selecting cultivation methods was indeed good, but it was basically useless on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ning Yudie walked toward Luo Zheng and jokingly remarked,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you can cultivate them all!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng merely rolled his eyes. Of course, it would be great if he could cultivate them all. The Law of Causality was nothing in his eyes, according to Immortal Book. So all the cultivation methods there couldn't hurt to choose.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng looked over, he saw a single book on the bookshelf that had yet to fall.</p>

  <p>It was thirty feet tall and twenty feet wide as well, but it was thin. With all the other books having fallen out, it seemed like a strange sight as it remained alone on the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Ning Yudie noticed it as well. "Why is there one that hasn't dropped yet? It must be a proud one as it refuses to let you learn it!"</p>

  <p>"Hey, what is that one about?" Saul asked when he and Immortal Book took notice as well.</p>

  <p>"Strange…" Immortal Book examined it curiously. "I've never seen that book before!"</p>

  <p>His exclamation was followed by Saul's dramatic sigh. "Having you stay in the library for so many years to become Immortal Book was in vain.</p>

  <p>Didn't you say you had read every single book in the library? Were you just boasting?"</p>

  <p>Still, Immortal Book looked confused. With him being nearly immortal, he had gone over all the books in the library over and over.</p>

  <p>With confidence, he could claim to have flipped through each book at least ten thousand times.</p>

  <p>But this book was new to him— a chill crept up his spine.</p>

  <p>In the midst of all the questioning, Luo Zheng leapt onto the row where the book sat.</p>

  <p>Because it was on the 20th row, Luo Zheng flew up over six thousand feet to reach it.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Mu Ning slowly followed suit, with Immortal Book and Saul catching up eagerly.</p>

  <p>Reaching the end of the row, Luo Zheng examined the book carefully.</p>

  <p>The book was clearly different from the rest— all of the others had a rune on the cover. When Immortal Book activated these runes, he could infuse his perception into them and absorb the books easily.</p>

  <p>But the massive book in front of Luo Zheng didn't seem to have any kind of means to open it.</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Zheng put a careful hand on the book's cover. Since he couldn't use his perception to read it, he thought he could try opening it with his own strength.</p>

  <p>But with a single tap, the book didn't budge at all, leaving Luo Zheng with a frown.</p>

  <p>Then, the power of two thousand dragon scales erupted.</p>

  <p>But the book refused to budge.</p>

  <p>Three thousand dragon scales…</p>

  <p>Four thousand…</p>

  <p>Five thousand…</p>

  <p>Still, the book remained motionless.</p>

  <p>It was as if the book were fake and could not be opened at all.</p>

  <p>"Let me open it!"</p>

  <p>"I'll do it."</p>

  <p>While Saul and Immortal Book would be stronger than Luo Zheng, he was taking control of the fairy palace step by step, meaning he could be considered their master as well.</p>

  <p>So instead of fighting over the book, the two tried to work the book open together.</p>

  <p>Still, the book didn't budge.</p>

  <p>"Old man, what do you think the situation is?" Saul asked in frustration.</p>

  <p>While his curiosity was overflowing, he had no clue how to attempt to open the book.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Immortal Book responded, "I've tried searching for a solution in our master's memoirs, but to no avail. I don't know what to do!" From the very beginning, Immortal Book tried to find answers within the memoirs.</p>

  <p>Having flipped through each book in the library thousands upon thousands of times, he could probably recite any book he wished— it was too simple a task for him at that point. But never did his master mention such a book without a rune. Was it that important that it had to be hidden?</p>

  <p>"It must be some kind of deceptive trick. Master probably doesn't wish for anyone to find this book. If that's the case, there must be a seal on the book somewhere. With only our strength, I'm afraid we can't open it,"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book concluded.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng stared at the unmovable book, thinking about how to get it open, he knew that the books on the floor were already more than enough for his cultivation.</p>

  <p>But no one could deny that the strange book tugged at everyone's curiosity— no matter what kind of cultivation method was held in the book, Luo Zheng was determined to see what was inside.</p>
