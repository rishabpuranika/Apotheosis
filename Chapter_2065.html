<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2065 Zheng's Sudden Disappearance (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Marko, stop blabbing nonsense! What are you waiting for? Just hurry up and kill the old guy!"</p>

  <p>As Pranav spoke, he continued his precise control of the five-colored small swords with which he attacked Zheng ferociously!</p>

  <p>Even Zheng, having deployed his Wishing Spell, could only handle three five-colored small swords at most. Every time the five-colored small swords simultaneously shot towards him, at least two of them would break through Zheng's defenses, penetrating his armor, leaving a deep, bloody wound on his body.</p>

  <p>But because Pranav had now been forced into a corner, he had no other choice but summon another two True Gods for help. Pranav was more than just pissed though, and in order to vent the boiling fury in his system, he loosened his attack on Zheng. In other words, as the five small swords drilled toward him, they didn't do so with the direct intention to take his life. Instead, the small, five-colored swords avoided Zheng's vitals parts, only leaving a painful lesion behind every single time!</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was wearing his Redemption Armor in order to protect his body, the small five-colored swords pierced through to his body with a ridiculous ease. Despite Zheng's best attempt at defending himself, he had at least two or three dozen wounds covering his whole body.</p>

  <p>Marko, who had just been scolded by Pranav, didn't show the slightest intention of shutting up. Instead, he chuckled and said, "Pranav, might you've taken a fancy to the boy? Since when have you had an interest in this mere little world lord?"</p>

  <p>These two True Gods had been summoned here by Pranav. They had crossed tens of thousands of supreme worlds, all the way from the Murphy Universe and entered directly into the Evolutionary Universe to come to Pranav's rescue.</p>

  <p>They had believed that Pranav was unable to defeat the True God of the Evolutionary Universe and had thus asked them for help.</p>

  <p>What they had never expected was that the battle they were walking into was actually against a secondary creature who was equally a world lord.</p>

  <p>And that even more so, Pranav had actually used the Five-element Divine Sword! The only explanations they could think of for using the Five-element Divine Sword against a world lord was either Pranav was completely out of his mind or he had developed a liking for that world lord. Other than that, the two of them couldn't think of any other plausible reason.</p>

  <p>However, once Marko had had the opportunity to observe the fight for a moment, his eyes revealed a hint of surprise. "Huh? This world lord actually looks like he has some ability. Did I just see him successfully block three small swords from Pranav?"</p>

  <p>The Five-element Divine Sword was Pranav's unique technique. Both Marko and Mateo were extremely wary of the latter.</p>

  <p>Neither of them had ever imagined that a single secondary creature in the Evolutionary Universe could resist a True God's unique technique. Even less coming from someone with nothing but a world lord cultivation level. There were no words: this was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>"The kid isn't weak whatsoever..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, and the kid even employed the Wishing Spell. I wonder how much he hates you, Pranav!"</p>

  <p>"Stop messing around with him, will you? Just kill the boy, damn it!"</p>

  <p>Marko actually seemed to enjoy watching the fight as he continually offered his unpopular commentary.</p>

  <p>In comparison to Marko, Mateo didn't say much at all. He and Marko had entered the Evolutionary Universe together, but he was making himself useful and had already started to fight with Wynn.</p>

  <p>Mateo was Marko and Pranav's senior fellow apprentice. He was the strongest out of the three True Gods, and at this moment, he wasn't at anywhere near a disadvantage. If Marko were to join in on the battle, Wynn would probably be defeated in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, Marko, who was still busy nagging Pranav, didn't appear to have any intention in making his first move. Instead, he watched with interest as Pranav attacked Zheng with his five small swords.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, many others still paid silent attention to the ongoing battle.</p>

  <p>Deep in the divine land, a dense mist was hanging motionlessly in the air.</p>

  <p>From the patches of thick fog, a corner of a jade building could only vaguely be seen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an angry voice resounded, "Murphy!" it shouted. "Three True Gods have been sent out for the war of the two universes. Do you dare break the rules?"</p>

  <p>As the voice echoed in the air, it seemed to contain a special kind of magic that enabled the voice to linger in one's ear. Even after a long period of time, the voice didn't dissipate but continued ringing tirelessly in one's head.</p>

  <p>After a long while, another voice rang out in reply, "So what?" it asked.</p>

  <p>"This is the new rule that has been set up by the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha! You can do that too."</p>

  <p>"The rules of the Hall of Holy Beings cannot be violated. Murphy's actions are not against the rules," a third voice was quick to answer.</p>

  <p>"But if rules can be changed at random, wouldn't it be too reckless? This rule that was set three thousand divine eras ago is changed right now, at this critical moment. It is indeed completely unfair!"</p>

  <p>"If you have the ability, then you too can also change the rules on the stone tablets yourself!"</p>

  <p>Numerous voices sounded out, interrupting one another as they argued.</p>

  <p>As they quarreled back and forth endlessly, an even more majestic voice sounded above theirs. The voice contained an irresistible aura as it spoke and said, "Stop arguing! The rules of the Hall of Holy Beings are not violated, and no one has the right to criticize Murphy. Have you forgotten the original intent for creating the Hall of Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>As this dignified voice was heard, everyone else quickly fell silent.</p>

  <p>A few of the Holy Being were actually quite sympathetic to what had happened to Mike.</p>

  <p>With a Holy Being's power, anyone was able to destroy Mike's inner world easily, which, of course, was the Evolutionary Universe.</p>
