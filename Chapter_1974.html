<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1974 In A Dilemma (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Maha indifferently looked at Supreme Lord Denzel. He didn't refute his words, though.</p>

  <p>"The master of the Murphy Universe has urged his disciples to repeatedly emphasize that no one else in the Evolutionary Universe is important, except for the Godly Geniuses, and everyone should spare no effort to go all out and kill them! This is your negligence to let that Godly Genius go, and you should trust that I will send a message back to the Murphy Universe!" Supreme Lord Denzel said.</p>

  <p>The master he spoke of was the creator of the Murphy Universe, Holy Murphy.</p>

  <p>In fact, from a racial-interest perspective, the Sacred race didn't have a strong motive for invading the Evolutionary Universe at all.</p>

  <p>The Murphy Universe was already so large, it was enough to hold the entire Sacred race. More so, there were still many supreme worlds within the Murphy Universe that the Sacred race had never occupied or even explored before.</p>

  <p>Taking over the Evolutionary Universe wouldn't do the Sacred race any good.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was ultimately created by Murphy though, and Murphy was the father of their race. He wanted the Sacred race to break the Sighing Wall and take over the Evolutionary Universe. There was simply no reason for the Sacred race to refuse!</p>

  <p>Before the Sighing Wall was opened, Murphy had sent a message through his disciples, saying that his primary goal was to occupy the entire Evolutionary Universe while his another goal was to kill all the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>If he could occupy the Evolutionary Universe, he knew he could kill Mike.</p>

  <p>By killing the Godly Geniuses, he'd be capable of severing any remaining hope that Mike might be able to make his own comeback.</p>

  <p>This was a common game between Holy Beings. As for the Sacred race, they didn't really comprehend what was going on. They didn't need to, either.</p>

  <p>Maha just shrugged his shoulders and rose from his seat in a single motion. He sauntered to the front of Supreme Lord Denzel, and the sneer on his face became even more intense. "That day, you weren't too far away from the Seven Ultimate World! Seeing as you've called me negligent for letting Luo Zheng get away, then tell me, why didn't you personally make a move to catch him?!"</p>

  <p>As Maha spoke, he let his tone blame everything on Supreme Lord Denzel.</p>

  <p>How could Supreme Lord Denzel not recognize the meaning behind his words? Just as he was about to refute Maha, both Supreme Lord Noel and Supreme Lord Barrie spoke up at the same time instead, "That kid's treasure is definitely extraordinary. Even if we tried our very best, we still wouldn't be able to break that fairy palace! The fairy palace must be a treasure from the divine land!"</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Denzel, it's easy for you to say that. But even if you had been there that day, I'm afraid you still wouldn't have been able to do anything!"</p>

  <p>With both Supreme Lords supporting him, Maha once again shrugged his shoulders. "Of course he knew that he couldn't do anything. That's why he didn't step out that day." Maha laughed obnoxiously. "But now, you actually want to report this to the master of the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel, your Heavenly Destiny is very strong, but your trickery seems to be even more powerful."</p>

  <p>Maha, Supreme Lord Noel and Supreme Lord Barrie had obviously colluded with each other beforehand. As the three of them echoed with one another, together they muddied the waters and shirked a portion of the responsibilities onto Supreme Lord Denzel's shoulders.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel, on the other hand, had his own thoughts on the situation, of course.</p>

  <p>He was one of the top 10 Supreme Lords of the Sacred race. After the Sighing Wall had been broken through, he felt as though he should have been named leader of this expedition team and come forth to attack.</p>

  <p>Never had he ever imagined that the leader position would be given to a child less than 100 years old!</p>

  <p>It was only natural for him to perceive this as unfair.</p>

  <p>Sacred race was not as united as it seemed. There were different branches inside the Sacred race. Supreme Lord Denzel had long since disliked Maha. It was just that the entire Sacred race was controlled by Maha's family - and Maha's father was also the number one Supreme Lord within the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Though extremely angry, Supreme Lord Denzel could only swallow his fury.</p>

  <p>He'd finally found an opportunity and decided to report the matter directly to the master of the Murphy Universe. The master attached great importance to these ten Godly Geniuses of the Evolutionary Universe, it therefore wasn't a small sin for Maha to have let that Godly Genius Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>But, just as he was about to go ahead and make things difficult for Maha, he was bitten by the boy. Supreme Lord Denzel was taken aback and felt quite depressed!</p>

  <p>Maha indifferently stared at Supreme Lord Denzel, as if he didn't take him seriously at all. He turned around and his figure flashed as he sat down, looking around at all the Supreme Lords present. He rested his chin on his hand and said, "Everyone, we've gathered here today in order to find a solution, not to argue. In such a situation, what sort of brilliant plan might you have for dealing with this?"</p>

  <p>It was true that the Sacred race had occupied over three thousand supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance, but in reality, they had also been dragged into a quagmire.</p>

  <p>If the Sacred race wanted to continue expanding toward the supreme worlds of the Thoughtless Minds, they would have to stabilize the supreme worlds that had already been seized, which was why they used the Blood Curse Array. This Blood Curse Array though, was very troublesome to employ and was also very expensive. It greatly slowed the speed of the Sacred race's expansion.</p>

  <p>Currently, the three great human forces, the Celestial Position, the ogre race, as well as the small races had all declared war on the Sacred race. If the Sacred race didn't take any more steps forward, it would greatly affect their morale!</p>

  <p>Thus, the Sacred race found themselves in a dilemma, to say the least.</p>
