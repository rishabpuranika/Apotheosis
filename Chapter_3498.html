<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3498 Taking The Palm Strike Head-on </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief saw the large palm print, a small smile graced their lips.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Cleon was a nice man as he had patiently explained the rules to Zheng, but when the fight began, he showed no mercy.</p>

  <p>Most disciples from the first floor couldn't withstand the large palm print at all!</p>

  <p>Given that Zheng had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, this time, the palm print's force could not only drain the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body, but also slap him half to death.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Elvinia, Dorothy, and Chaim weren't so worried at that moment.</p>

  <p>They knew that what Zheng had experienced in the Chaotic Source World was far worse than Cleon's palm print.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't summon a world and activate the Inheritance of World, he would still be able to cope with it.</p>

  <p>Just as the large palm print was about to strike his head, he looked like he wouldn't dodge it.</p>

  <p>These days, he had constantly summoned the Regal Jade sculptures to refine his body.</p>

  <p>He'd summoned from the first sculpture to the tenth to refine his body from the beginning, and the Truth of Godly Way in his physical body was enough to meet the needs of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>But as their strength increased, so did their need for the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng could only summon stronger Regal Jade sculptures. Later, the Regal Jade sculptures that he used to refine his body were basically the sculptures from the tenth to the twentieth.</p>

  <p>Recently, he had activated the twentieth to the thirtieth sculptures!</p>

  <p>His Chaotic Source Spirits were so strong that even when under the siege of those ten sculptures, they could still hold on for a while. Indeed, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had improved by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, how could a palm print with merely the force of three thousand divine megatons possibly hurt him?</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The huge palm print finally struck down on Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>When Cleon saw Zheng simply raise his hands to cover his face, he smiled lazily and muttered, "How naive..."</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud thud when the huge palm print hit Zheng's skull hard.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body became extremely active. The light dots repeatedly jumped around and at the same time, a golden light circulated around the surface of Zheng's body once. Then it entered into his body.</p>

  <p>It was a fascinating sight, and everyone's eyes were focused on him.</p>

  <p>Cleon also looked at him in curiosity.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had received such a heavy blow, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body should be quickly exhausted. While the strong Other Shore Power simultaneously repressed his body, all his internal organs, even the bones and flesh would explode.</p>

  <p>Most people could foresee such a thing to happen as well.</p>

  <p>Yet, it didn't happen…</p>

  <p>Zheng still stood there unharmed with a small smile on his lips. It seemed as if he had not been hurt at all.</p>

  <p>Silence befell around the arena.</p>

  <p>Those who knew Zheng well like Elvinia, Dorothy, Chaim, and some others were also utterly surprised.</p>

  <p>They were sure that Zheng had a way to deal with the huge palm print, but they never expected that he would be able to use his physical body to resist it head-on.</p>

  <p>They had refined the Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm on the same day as Zheng!</p>

  <p>It had only been a month!</p>

  <p>Could it be really true that Zheng had already strengthened the Chaotic Source Spirits to such a level in just one month?</p>

  <p>When it came to magic pills and treasures, Elvinia and Dorothy were in no way inferior to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Origin Mountain and the Phoenix Palace had taught them some exclusive body refining methods which specialized in the cultivation on the Chaotic Source Spirits. Such body refining methods, however, were barely different from each other, so the speed of their improvement was almost about the same.</p>

  <p>Even then, Zheng's progress was way beyond the others' imaginations.</p>

  <p>If Dorothy, Elvinia, and the rest of them were all shocked, then more so the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief, whose eyes were wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>Most especially Chance and Abdul, who almost dropped their jaws.</p>

  <p>Chance had been so eager to see the time when Cleon could slap Zheng to death with that huge palm print, as it would relieve the hate he felt.</p>

  <p>He was pleased when Zheng didn't dodge Cleon's attack, as it was exactly what he wanted to see.</p>

  <p>But, the result was totally different from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>As for Abdul, he couldn't speak nor move. His eyes just stared in shock.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Land of Sword Grief for such a long time, but he could only achieve a strike with two thousand and five hundred divine megatons of force at most.</p>

  <p>The force of the palm strike that had hit Zheng was much greater than the strike Abdul could launch.</p>

  <p>In other words...</p>

  <p>Abdul realized that he could never defeat Zheng, even if the latter just stood still and let him beat his body as he liked.</p>

  <p>Although Abdul did not come to the arena to fight himself, what he saw was like a hammer that pounded his heart. He was absolutely crushed.</p>

  <p>On the second floor, the warrior with the white face and his burly companion, Yusuf, were also taken aback. Aside from being astounded, Yusuf also felt a little excited.</p>

  <p>"Do you still think he is stupid now?" asked the warrior with a white face.</p>

  <p>A deep sigh came out from Yusuf's lips.</p>

  <p>"It seems that there is another remarkable figure in the Flow Sword Sect after me!" he said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't blow your own trumpet," the white faced man said and glared at him. "You had stayed on the first floor for a long time back then. This man just came to the Land of Sword Grief, yet he is able to challenge Cleon. Can you even compare to such a freak?"</p>

  <p>Forget about Yusuf...</p>

  <p>Perhaps in the whole history of the Land of Sword Grief, there had never appeared such a figure.</p>

  <p>In turn, Yusuf immediately kept quiet upon hearing what the warrior with a white face said.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, the crowd began to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>"What happened?</p>

  <p>Did Cleon hold back his strength?" "It's impossible!</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power the giant palm print has released is at least three thousand divine megatons, and Cleon used eighty percent of his strength!"</p>

  <p>"But that guy didn't move a bit!</p>

  <p>Logically, three thousand divine megatons of force is enough to crush him into pieces, right?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cleon stood in the arena with his right hand still in the position of launching the palm strike.</p>

  <p>His eyes were full of disbelief, as if he was in front of a monster and not a warrior.</p>

  <p>"Please, go on," said Zheng, who stretched his hand and made the same gesture as Cleon's.</p>

  <p>At that point, Cleon even suspected that Zheng had used some special Other Shore Token which blocked the attack for him.</p>

  <p>However, there was no way to use the magical powers of any Other Shore Token in that arena. If Zheng attempted to do so, it would activate the arrays around the arena and he would have been kicked out already.</p>

  <p>The arrays were not activated, which meant that Zheng had relied on himself to take the attack.</p>

  <p>"Go on?" Cleon hissed. His eyes flashed coldly at his opponent.</p>

  <p>Cleon had held back a little of his strength. After all, it would be troublesome if he had accidentally killed Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, he decided to strike with his full power. He flipped his hands, and numerous large palm prints began to take shape and circle around Zheng.</p>

  <p>The palm prints intertwined to form a dangerous killing trap!</p>

  <p>Experienced Other Shore Realm warriors knew that one should get out of those large palm prints immediately, but Zheng did not intend to escape at all.</p>

  <p>Instead, he just let himself be trapped.</p>

  <p>"Smash him!"</p>

  <p>A killing intent flashed in Cleon's eyes. He flipped his palm, and the many palm prints swept over Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had a special way that helped him to resist his palm strike just now, the Chaotic Source Spirits inside his body would eventually be exhausted. Now that he launched a continuous attack of his palm prints, Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits would be worn out at a faster rate.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe that Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits were different, unlike anything he had ever seen!</p>
