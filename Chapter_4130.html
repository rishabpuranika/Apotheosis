<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4130 Bad News </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It took a long time for the Snake Goddess to recover. She slowly opened her eyes as she lay weakly in Fuxi's arms.</p>

  <p>"Are you feeling better?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded and gently freed herself from his arms.</p>

  <p>She realized that she had almost been completely lost. Her consciousness was controlled by that destructive force.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, was that the limit of your strength?" A turtle about ten feet long was crawling on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>On his right side was a sloth, and on his left was a scorpion.</p>

  <p id="top_18">Gerald, Judson, and Kendrick had been hiding inside the Li Shan mountain. To conveniently communicate with the others, they each created an avatar.</p>

  <p>"Well..." The Snake Goddess paused as she thought for a while. She shook her head and denied, "No."</p>

  <p>Just now, she felt her power almost becoming limitless. It was because of this infinite destructive power that she was lost. The power seemed to give her everything.</p>

  <p>Kendrick smiled bitterly. "It appears that I can't block your black flame."</p>

  <p>"You are strong indeed, but this power can make you lose your mind.</p>

  <p>You'd better not use it," Fuxi suggested worriedly.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, "Maybe it's because we don't know much about the bloodline power. After we master the Blood-controlling Method, it will take us some time to adapt."</p>

  <p>After he, Ying, and King Ieuan mastered the Blood-controlling Method, their strength also increased greatly. It might be incomparable to the Snake Goddess's or Fuxi's level, but they were almost the same.</p>

  <p>In the Dark Haze Peak, Luo Zheng, Yan, and the others saw what happened in the sky.</p>

  <p>"The strength of the Snake Goddess is frightening!" Xun couldn't hide the surprise from her eyes.</p>

  <p>Yan smiled. "The strength of the Snake Goddess has improved so much.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, you should make more progress, too!"</p>

  <p>"My situation is a little special. I haven't made much progress," Luo Zheng said as he looked to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Blood-controlling Method he cultivated was the most basic one. It could help him improve his strength, but the improvement wouldn't be as great as those of other Eternal Realm cultivators. After all, he didn't really control the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>While he was lost in thought, a girl walked to him. She had hair put up in pigtails, a small round face, and a pair of eyes as pure as big black gemstones. She faintly resembled Xi Youqin.</p>

  <p>"Father, I want a hug!" The girl requested while stretching out her arms to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the girl in his arms and lifted her above his head. She giggled.</p>

  <p>The girl was Salome, he and Xi Youqin's daughter. She had been in the Immortal Mansion after being born in his inner world.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had returned from the Other Shore, he enjoyed some rare leisure days and invited all the women out of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Although Salome was less than two years old, she was intelligent enough to read over a thousand words under the guidance of her mother and the others. Now she could read some simple Sanskrit words on her own.</p>

  <p>She had the ability similar to Luo Nian's, but she was much more obedient than him.</p>

  <p>This was only the second time Salome had seen Luo Zheng, but the two of them didn't feel estranged from each other.</p>

  <p>After playing with Salome for a while, Luo Zheng handed her to Xi Youqin. Only then did he catch Yudie's glance and notice her. She stood not far away with eyes filled with sadness.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had been in the Deleting Space for a long time, but there had been no news about him yet.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng tried to communicate with Ziya through the Descending Ring and failed.</p>

  <p>Yudie grew more worried with each passing day that Luo Nian's condition remained unknown.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards her and placed his hand on her shoulder. Yudie looked up as she smiled tearfully. Luo Zheng held her in his arms, comforting her.</p>

  <p>He couldn't go to the Deleting Space and he couldn't do anything to help.</p>

  <p>He felt helpless as he could only place his hope on Ziya.</p>

  <p>A few days later, shocking news started to spread throughout the Source World and the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God Othniel died.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan died.</p>

  <p>And the Divine Farmer also died!</p>

  <p>With the support of the Element Spirit Civilization, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were undoubtedly the strongest super forces in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The news that the leaders of these two super forces and a Chaos Ancient God had died was no less shocking than the battle of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Since the Moon Shield City had not suffered a devastating blow, many people witnessed the battle. The scene that the Evil God fought against three masters alone had also spread.</p>

  <p>When the news reached the Li Shan mountain, it immediately attracted attention, causing great discussion among the people.</p>

  <p>All the important figures of the Li Shan mountain arrived and assembled on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>The death of the Xuanyuan was good news, yet a heavy atmosphere surrounded them.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had killed not only the Chaos Ancient God Othniel but also the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer. It was too amazing that he had done this all alone.</p>

  <p>The three Chaos Ancient Gods guarded the Li Shan mountain mainly to defend against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. Now the leaders of the two super forces had been killed, but they were facing an even more terrifying enemy.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God can produce many avatars, and each of them has his strength.</p>

  <p>His power of the Ways-blending Energy is astonishing.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer were also very powerful. They must have obtained the Blood-controlling Methods from the Element Spirit Civilization. The Xuanyuan had actually killed hundreds of the Evil God's avatars." After Fuxi initiated the conversation, he threw the green crystal in his hand to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The green stone was known as the Memory-recording Crystal. As its name suggested, it was a kind of crystal that recorded memories in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The owner of the Memory-recording Crystal hid in a corner of the Moon Shield City. He watched the battle from an excellent angle, wide enough to observe everything that took place.</p>

  <p>His Memory-recording Crystal became known and was sold at a very high price. The Ear Mouse race afforded to buy it and sent it to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng caught the Memory-recording Crystal and put it on his forehead.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it was as if he had been present in the Moon Shield City. He witnessed how over ten thousand avatars of the Evil God killed Othniel.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng carefully threw the Memory-recording Crystal to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who later passed it to Ying after his reading.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell into a deafening silence after they had read the Memory-recording Crystal.</p>

  <p>With their insight, they had a collective intuition of the strength of the Evil God. It was intimidating indeed!</p>

  <p>"Those who have something to do with you are all monsters, Luo Zheng," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Aside from Luo Zheng, his children also had special talents. Even the Evil God who popped out of his inner world could grow to such a terrifying level.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess interrupted, "But one thing is very strange about this."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God will definitely target the Li Shan mountain and Luo Zheng next," the Snake Goddess concluded. "However, if he wants to attack us, he shouldn't have left so many survivors in the Moon Shield City. His ability could kill all its people and even those in the Blood Sea Province. Why would he let these people live and spread the news?"</p>

  <p>If the Evil God sneaked into the Li Shan mountain and used his exceptional power, the Li Shan mountain would be left defenseless and completely defeated.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Luo Zheng after hearing the Snake Goddess's analysis. He was the one who knew the Evil God best.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng answered instantly, "Because he's certain of himself."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Evil God, this was a sure win. No matter how hard Luo Zheng resisted, he would never be able to escape.</p>
