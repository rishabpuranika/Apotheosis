<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Dance Palace had mediocre talents. However, they had connections with the higher-ups of the Seven-Star City and the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Each of them had a different sort of link with them. They were either direct descendants of some elders, or members of the large clans in the Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>Due to these links, they were spoiled rotten by their families. When they collectively joined the Sword Dance Palace, they became well acquainted with one another and formed an alliance. This proved cancerous for the Sword Light Palace. If anyone dared provoke them, they would find themselves facing severe consequences.</p>

  <p>After learning the rules of the palace, he made up his mind on what he had to do and headed back to the backyard through the same path he came.</p>

  <p>As he made his way back, an explosive sound coming from the backyard made him stop in his tracks. Shortly after, he witnessed a strong wave of heat spread across the walls. Before he could process anything, he heard disturbing outcries coming from the direction of the sound. He quickened his steps to see what was going on.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Kenelm and the others lay splayed out on the ground in the backyard. Each of their bodies was charred and badly injured from the impact.</p>

  <p>In a state of shock, one of the injured warriors became furious and shouted,</p>

  <p>"We are now fellow disciples of the Sword Dance Palace after we joined.</p>

  <p>How could you treat us like this?"</p>

  <p>The man who spoke out was a respectable authority figure at the Excellence City. He had been recommended by the city lord to become a disciple at the Sword Dance Palace. His arrogant nature did not stand for this behavior towards him. How could he stomach being treated with such disgrace by the members of the Sword Dance Palace?</p>

  <p>"Who are our fellow disciples? Do you think you are even qualified?" An authoritative voice came from the group. A silver-haired young man pushed aside the disciples and walked over to the protesting man. The approaching figure had handsome features, and was the youngest of the group.</p>

  <p>Overflowing with arrogance he took two steps towards this man before stomping him down on the ground. He looked at the man and scowled.</p>

  <p>"Whether you can join the Sword Dance Palace or not is not the decision of the higher-ups or Ingram. It is us, who make the final call. Understood?"</p>

  <p>The man gritted his teeth and glared at him. "What should we do to join the Sword Dance Palace?"</p>

  <p>The silver-haired boy shrugged his shoulders and chuckled in amusement.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have to pass five tests. What you've experienced just now was the first test: the burning test!"</p>

  <p>"What's the second test?" the man asked looking displeased.</p>

  <p>"The second test is the statue test," the silver-haired boy replied as traces of ice particles began to spread from his fingertips. "I'll freeze you into statues and place you in our backyard for ten to fifteen days. If you are willing to accept the test, I'll do it right now. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>As the boy continued talking disrespectfully, Kenelm could feel himself fuming with anger. He dug his nails into the ground and gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>The humiliation from the disciples kept testing his patience. Everything was getting on his nerves.</p>

  <p>Normally, he was gentle and kind. But the disciples had driven him off the edge. He felt a strong killing intent generate inside of him, and he scowled,</p>

  <p>"I'll fight you to death. Right here, right now!" With a cold look on his face, he got up and knocked his fists together.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As his internal momentum burst out from his body, Kenelm charged towards the silver-haired boy like a sharp knife.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was a consummate True God, and his power was not to be underestimated. He dashed towards the silver-haired boy and unleashed all his energy. Because of the short distance between him and the boy, the attack would prove more effective.</p>

  <p>However, just as he made his move, a disciple stepped up and reached for a silver bead. The silver bead in his hand shone a flash of silver light on its surface. Suddenly, Kenelm's internal momentum dissipated into thin air rendering him powerless.</p>

  <p>Before he could get to the silver-haired boy, the boy flipped in the air and gave Kenelm a hard kick on his chest.</p>

  <p>He felt his chest cave in as he was knocked back for several dozen feet from the impact. His back knocked against a rock as he fell with a loud thud and passed out from the pain.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to fight me to death? You bastard!" The silver-haired boy scoffed while fixing his hair.</p>

  <p>These disciples were not strong in terms of physical strength; they were not the most gifted in talents either. But, they were each from a noble clan.</p>

  <p>Each of them possessed powerful treasures handed down to them from their families. All of them were given Latent Theurgies for protection. Ordinary consummate True Gods like Kenelm were no match for them.</p>

  <p>The faces of the others from the Excellence City turned pale when they saw what Kenelm had gone through for protesting against them. They did not wish to suffer the same fate.</p>

  <p>Before coming here, they had heard the Sword Dance Palace was not a serious place for cultivation. The only thing that attracted them was the fact that it was under the jurisdiction of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Despite all the warnings, they had never imagined to encounter such a cruel group in the Sword Dance Palace. They recalled Ingram telling them about the "little devils" of the Sword Dance Palace. Little had they known that he was referring to the disciples in front of them!</p>

  <p>"Anyone who wants to pass five tests will line up before me. The rockery in this backyard is too monotonous for my taste. Although you are all terrible-looking, you will be good decorations for this place. If you are unwilling to do that, you can just quit joining the Sword Dance Palace and go back home," the silver-haired boy said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>The other disciples behind him burst into laughter. Every time there was a newcomer, they would toy around with them. It became a ritual for them.</p>

  <p>"We'd better give up joining the Sword Dance Palace."</p>

  <p>"These guys are making things difficult for us on purpose!"</p>

  <p>"Even if we agree with their requirements, they won't let us be in peace in the future!"</p>

  <p>The people from the Excellence City discussed among themselves. They had realized these disciples did not plan on making things easy for them. If they bowed to their wishes now, they would suffer forever. They would not stop until they had driven them all away.</p>

  <p>"You're goddamn right," the silver-haired boy said nonchalantly. "The resources in the Sword Dance Palace are limited. You trashy guys expect us to share them with you? It's wishful thinking. You'd better get out of here as soon as possible..."</p>

  <p>Before the boy could finish what he had to say, Luo Zheng walked in from the corridor.</p>

  <p>He ran a quick gaze around the backyard and found Kenelm unconscious on the rockery.</p>

  <p>The group watched as Luo Zheng made his way towards Kenelm in silence. He helped Kenelm down and wrapped his arm around his shoulder. A green light flickered in Luo Zheng's hand as he pressed it against Kenelm's frail body. It was the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the light got absorbed into Kenelm's wounds and began healing them. He slowly recovered and opened his eyes. Kenelm groaned slightly and blinked several times to make out Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Where did you go?" Kenelm asked as he regained his full consciousness.</p>

  <p>"To know the rules, of course," Luo Zheng replied with a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>"To know the rules? What do you mean?" Kenelm asked again in confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced towards the disciples and loosened his grip on Kenelm. He slowly stood up and said indifferently, "I heard that all disciples can fight freely as long as no one dies in combat. I didn't expect the rules of the Sword Light Palace to be so loose."</p>

  <p>When the silver-haired boy heard this, he smirked mockingly. "Why do you trouble yourself to learn these rules? Do you want to fight with us?"</p>

  <p>In the Seven-Star City, they were always the ones who would bully others.</p>

  <p>No one dared to stand up against them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng balled his hands into fists and tightened his jaw. He glared at the silver-haired boy and smiled, "That's exactly what I've been thinking about!"</p>

  <p>The moment these words left his mouth, Luo Zheng dashed towards the silver-haired boy like an arrow released from its bow. The ground beneath his feet turned to powder as he stomped on it with massive strength.</p>

  <p>The boy froze in place unable to react. Baffled from Luo Zheng's sudden advancement, the boy saw a vicious flash of light sparkled in front of his eyes. Before he could say anything, Luo Zheng's fist made contact with his face and sent him flying.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a grating sound, the silver-haired boy rolled over in the air and crashed into the wall of the backyard. The impact of his back hitting the wall so hard cracked it into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only used one-tenth of his whole strength in this punch. Had he used up his full potential, he could have cracked the boy's skull open.</p>

  <p>The silver-haired boy's handsome face had been deformed from the blow as he lay motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Everyone who witnessed the scene gasped in utter bewilderment. After all, the young boy's father was the head of the noble Yuebai Clan!</p>
