<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Central Region, which was also called the Sky Northern Region, and the Sea God Continent, were separated by hundreds of thousands of miles and Luo Zheng could not think of any other way of traveling across these two continents than through the massive transmission array in the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>But could there really be such a coincidence?</p>

  <p>The Yolande in front of him had the exact appearance, clothing, and temperament - there wasn't the slightest difference at all from the Yolande he knew, save for her cultivation base and method.</p>

  <p>The Yolande in White Emperor City mainly cultivated a method related to enchanted barriers but the one in front of him used finger movements.</p>

  <p>As he mulled this over, the orc on the battle stage suddenly let out an earthshaking roar. He crazily rushed towards Yolande, his feet heavy and strong and the giant axe in his hand surging with gales of wind as he waved it around wildly.</p>

  <p>The orc's heavy strength was a sharp contrast to Yolande's soft, lithe dodges. It was as if she was a leaf floating amidst a strong wind as she constantly shifted from left to right, avoiding the killer swing of her opponent's huge axe.</p>

  <p>Olivia saw Zheng's expression and smiled, "You seem to be worried about her?" she giggled on her sleeve. "There's no need to worry at all! Yolande…</p>

  <p>She's a very strange person."</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed at her statement. "Strange? How so?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She's been in the tower for six years and she's been stuck on the tenth floor for the longest time," Olivia said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened in surprise. "Six years?! Stuck on the tenth floor?"</p>

  <p>Olivia nodded, confirming her words. "She'll fight six matches a month and accumulate a lot of Lucky Light. I bet the amount she has obtained till now is enough to create around twenty war lords but she never refines it. Instead, she gives it all away to other people."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless by Olivia's revelation. "She… She gives her Lucky Light away?" he repeated, almost choking in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Olivia nodded, "Yes. Sometimes, when a human warrior challenges her, she immediately admits defeat. In this way, all her accumulated Lucky Light will automatically belong to the challenger."</p>

  <p>Such a method was indeed feasible if one took a look at the rules of the tower, but what was Yolande's purpose in doing so? Why stay here on the tenth floor? Why remain as a tenth level war general? Why give away all the Lucky Light? What was her real purpose?</p>

  <p>Warriors generally entered the Tower of Sin to rapidly improve their cultivation base through the use of Lucky Light. Yolande, however, seemed to be doing the exact opposite: she was actually freely giving her Lucky Light away!</p>

  <p>Another question popped up in Zheng's mind. "Since she has been able to stay in the Tower of Sin for so long, why would anyone still dare to challenge her?"</p>

  <p>Olivia shrugged, "There will always be brave men in search of great reward," she said with a soft smile. "Yolande likes to amass an enormous amount of Lucky Light and, sometimes, people overestimate their own strength and challenge her thinking that if they defeat her, they'd be able to get a shocking amount of reward."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at her explanation, "Makes sense."</p>

  <p>As they talked, the situation in the arena had suddenly been reversed.</p>

  <p>Yolande was now the one who suddenly sped up and rushed towards the opponent. She narrowly avoided his swing and jumped high, stepping on the orc's face with her small, wooden clogs as she floated into the air.</p>

  <p>Her slender body flipped softly in midair as she gathered an invisible forceful energy in her hand.</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth and her cold, clear voice rang out in the entire arena,</p>

  <p>"Nether Finger!"</p>

  <p>"PUFF!"</p>

  <p>The immense power from Yolande's finger shot out, directly piercing through the orc's skull and the arena floor, leaving behind a large, smoking hole.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly raised his brows. "Transparent forceful energy!" He had remembered the Yolande in White Emperor City using a special kind of colorless and formless life vitality. He had never seen anyone else with the same pure and transparent life vitality and this might be conclusive evidence in establishing a relationship between the two Yolandes.</p>

  <p>Oblivious to his thoughts, Olivia was focused on the match and heaved a big sigh, "The people on the ninth floor have probably suffered again…"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was pulled out of his mulling and gazed at the huge, gaping hole in the middle of the arena. He couldn't help but agree with Olivia. Yolande's strength had directly penetrated through the floor and onto the arena below.</p>

  <p>Such a display of strength was astonishing and, even if she was just a tenth-level war general, Luo Zheng didn't have any confidence in defeating her.</p>

  <p>The hole in the arena bubbled and squirmed as it healed, almost as if it was the mouth of a monster. The orc, on the other hand, had a small hole through his head that would never heal. His dead body fell heavily onto the floor and into the awaiting arms of the arena that quickly absorbed him like water permeating through dry, arid sand.</p>

  <p>The crowd was immediately abuzz.</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have challenged Yolande. That woman already has the strength of a war lord. Challenging her means certain death!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but sometimes the temptation is too great! Yolanda has already accumulated six months' worth of Lucky Light and it hasn't been gifted to anyone else yet. Anyone who successfully defeats her will no doubt be able to become a war lord instantly with that amount of Lucky Light."</p>

  <p>"The greater the temptation, the greater the risk. About a hundred war generals have already died at her hands, am I right? The human race is such a weak race and yet such a talented person has appeared among them.</p>

  <p>Yolande's basically the lord of the tenth floor! Yet she doesn't show any intention of advancing to the next floor. It'd be best if she just ascends and gets killed by those war lords."</p>

  <p>"It's not just her! I've heard the human race had gained another talent recently. That guy called Luo Zheng has just advanced to the tenth floor. Really makes you wonder if the human race will truly rise again."</p>

  <p>Despite the weakness of the human race, a special figure like Yolande could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>A streak of Lucky Light shone from the orc's token and shot towards Yolande's. After the exchange, she looked around with an expressionless face, "Who else wants to challenge me?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Nobody made a sound.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked once and walked down the arena.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a chance for her to advance freely after three consecutive days of default victory?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, but… so what?" Olivia said, shrugging with a smile. "I bet she's already encountered a hundred default victories by now. The longest she stayed with no challenges was about a month. Anyway, I don't think she'd want to be promoted. If she had been willing to advance, then the human race might've gotten another seat."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Yolande had walked down from the arena and was heading directly in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>He watched her colorful skirt sway left to right as her clogs clattered on the floor. The sight had him thinking back to the one known as "Killer Girl" in White Emperor City. He briefly wondered if this Yolande had the exact same scars on her back like the one he knew.</p>

  <p>She stopped about a foot away in front of Luo Zheng. He did not intend to ask her about his suspicions since he did not want to reveal to anyone that he came from the Central Region. If anything, he'd prefer to ask her in a more private conversation.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, she suddenly closed the distance between them to lean her small head and sniff.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found himself moving back in astonishment. Olivia and the other human war generals all sported puzzled expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>However, they were used to Yolande's strangeness and did not think too much of it. She was an enigma even to the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Five years ago, a human war lord named Cecilia Yue was said to have ascended to the top of the tower after receiving a large amount of Lucky Light from Yolande. Cecilia's ascension inevitably led to her obtaining the fourth seat for the human race. Though her success was a result of her own efforts and strength, it could not be denied that Yolande's Lucky Light had been a huge contributing factor to be considered.</p>

  <p>Yolande took a deep breath and gave Luo Zheng an ice-cold gaze, "The smell from your body is very good. I really like it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really know what to reply. What kind of smell could he exactly have? Her actions made Luo Zheng certain that this Yolande and the Yolande in White Emperor City were not the same person but he got even more confused with this conclusion.</p>

  <p>What then was the connection between the two Yolandes?</p>

  <p>Despite the innumerable amount of people in this boundless universe, it was impossible for this to just be mere coincidence. Their names, appearance, clothing - everything was the same!</p>

  <p>Olivia revealed a strange smile and shook her head, 'This young girl is truly a strange person, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"Fight me. If you can beat me, I'll give you my Lucky Light," Yolande added.</p>

  <p>Her words made him roll his eyes. He had no confidence in defeating her as of the moment though he might have a narrow victory if he activated his Stellar Body. However, he didn't really think there was a need to go so far since both of them were from the human race. Also, if Luo Zheng were to defeat Yolande, her Lucky Light would naturally belong to him. Why would he need her to gift it to him? It didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Dylon was puffing up his cheeks in jealousy, 'Where'd this guy even come from anyway?' he thought to himself. 'He probably doesn't even know Yolande, right? Even if a human war lord came over to her, Yolande wouldn't even spare a glance but now, she actually came over to talk to Luo Zheng. This doesn't make any sense at all! And she also told him he smells good? What kind of smell can a man have? Aren't all men just stinky?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I won't fight you," he said, refusing her offer.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Yolande asked before staring at him intently.</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from?" he asked, partly from curiosity and partly because he wanted to change the subject.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked before showing a rare, meaningful expression on her face,</p>

  <p>"You've seen me before?"</p>
