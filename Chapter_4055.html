  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bacchus was after all not an ordinary Glede Demon.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he quickly reacted in just the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, Tate had caught the soft Wolf Owl King, so Bacchus, who was wrapped by the Wolf Owl King's body, naturally got dragged along as well.</p>

  <p>Now, all Tate had to do was to cut open the Wolf Owl King and crush Bacchus into pieces.</p>

  <p>He was sure that he would kill Bacchus, who had always defeated him, this time, and it would be glorious!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, Bacchus' reaction was faster.</p>

  <p>Bacchus did his best not to panic in such a critical moment, but he made a wise decision to take back the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>That Treacherous Being had a particularly unique form.</p>

  <p>When it was soft, it was as soft as feathers or even water.</p>

  <p>But when it was sturdy, it became similar to the most powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>When Bacchus thought of it, the Wolf Owl King turned into pieces of white gauze and shrank back into his body.</p>

  <p>Of course, Tate wanted to snatch it, but he could not. He could only stand and watch the white gauze slip away.</p>

  <p>"You want to run away?" he shouted as he headed straight for Bacchus.</p>

  <p>In turn, Bacchus' wings unfurled, and he quickly rose into the sky.</p>

  <p>He sighed in relief, but it was short-lived. Right after he temporarily got away, something suddenly appeared in front of him. "What is that white light?" he said in shock.</p>

  <p>Still, no matter how powerful that thing was, he was not afraid.</p>

  <p>After all, he could defeat everything with the help of the Wolf Owl King.</p>

  <p>The Wolf Owl King was his most powerful magical weapon, and also his closest comrade in arms.</p>

  <p>After countless battles, he and the Wolf Owl King became one.</p>

  <p>Just now, the Wolf Owl King felt a sharp stab of pain, and Bacchus felt sorry for it.</p>

  <p>The white light of the Red Demons was so terrifying that it could directly injure Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>How did such a thing appear in the Night View Island?</p>

  <p>For so many years, the members of the Night View Island depended on the Treacherous Beings to fight their enemies.</p>

  <p>They were indeed powerful, but so were the many races.</p>

  <p>Currently, the white light in the hands of the Red Demons made the resentment-level Treacherous Being lose its strength and hostility-level Treacherous Beings collapse. It was terrifying to even think about it.</p>

  <p>It was like when a group of people fought using sticks, and suddenly, one of them got a knife. Of course, it was an unfair advantage.</p>

  <p>What made things worse was that every member of the Red Demon race possessed that white light.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Bacchus felt desperate and almost wanted to give up.</p>

  <p>"Leader, what should we do?"</p>

  <p>"The white light can kill our Treacherous Beings!"</p>

  <p>"If we lose the Treacherous Beings, we can't defeat the Red Demon race..."</p>

  <p>At that point, the Glede Demons panicked in fear and gathered behind Bacchus.</p>

  <p>Although he was also at a loss on what to do, as the leader of the Glede Demons, he had a great mindset and quickly forced himself to calm down.</p>

  <p>Six Glede Demons had already died in the current round of the battle.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Wolf Owls on the seven other Glede Demons' bodies had fallen.</p>

  <p>All in all, thirteen Glede Demons lost their powers.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the small stones in the hands of the Red Demons still glowed brightly as ever. Additionally, such a deadly treasure was not disposable.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Bacchus came to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>They couldn't fight against the Red Demons. If they failed to escape from the birdcage, they would die.</p>

  <p>"Don't confront the Red Demons head-on! Fly around the birdcage!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"But we can't fly out!" said one Glede Demon. Howls filled the air as the other Glede Demons behind him kept clawing at the birdcage for dear life.</p>

  <p>Bacchus did not answer.</p>

  <p>Now, they were really in a hopeless situation.</p>

  <p>Their only hope was that the birdcage would not last long. When the birdcage collapsed by itself, they could escape.</p>

  <p>If Bacchus could flee, he would surely ask about the news and find a way to get those kinds of stones like crazy!</p>

  <p>To avoid being easily caught by the Red Demons, he asked the Glede Demons to fly around the birdcage. After all, they could still quickly get rid of the Red Demons even in the small space.</p>

  <p>However, it was not easy to catch and kill them.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the Red Demons did not have the slightest intention to fly and capture them.</p>

  <p>Instead, they all stood on the ground and watched them fly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng and his group lurked around under the protection of the Magic Camouflage Skin and watched the battle between the two races.</p>

  <p>Even the two strongest races had a fatal weakness when they used the Treacherous Beings, which was they could not resist the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng and the others had felt confident that with the Light of Annihilation, they would win against these races.</p>

  <p>However, no one among them expected that just as the two races began fighting, the Red Demons brought out the Holy Stones!</p>

  <p>There was no Holy Stone on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>That was what Decker had said, and based on Bacchus' expression, they saw that he also thought the same.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization has arrived," the Snake Goddess prompted.</p>

  <p>"It seems that they acted faster, and they allied with the Red Demon race so quickly..." Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Since the Element Spirit Civilization had handed over the Holy Stones to the Red Demons, he and the others also needed to do something.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, they could be allies with the Glede Demons in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Even then, they were still hesitant as they hid in the Magic Camouflage Skin. It was not wise to expose their whereabouts too early. Besides, it was highly likely that the Element Spirit Civilization also tracked them.</p>

  <p>While they thought about it, Tate had already grown tired of the Glede Demons' movements.</p>

  <p>He chuckled and said, "This birdcage is for you. Now, you cannot fly out, and you will suffer greatly!"</p>

  <p>With that, he reached out and pinched the birdcage hard.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...</p>

  <p>As a result, the birdcage that covered the mountain began to shrink.</p>

  <p>Then, the relatively large space began to shrink continually as well.</p>

  <p>Bacchus saw the shrinking birdcage and became even more desperate.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings could not help them in such a narrow space, so they had no choice but to suffer the Red Demons' torture.</p>

  <p>As the birdcage continued to shrink, its edges suddenly touched something.</p>

  <p>Tate looked towards it and saw a "space" that moved as the birdcage shrank.</p>

  <p>There was something hidden inside it!</p>

  <p>His blood ran cold.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>Whoever got trapped in that birdcage, they would surely be ground into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Holy Stone was strong, but it was a secret weapon. One could use its maximum power only during surprise attacks.</p>

  <p>In actuality, Tate wanted to eradicate both the Glede Demon race and the Grand Mighty race.</p>

  <p>"Come out!"</p>

  <p>He took out a bone spear from behind and threw it towards that space, which kept changing color.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The bone spear flew towards the target at once.</p>

  <p>Just as it was about to hit the target, a hand stretched out from the space and firmly caught the bone spear.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Tate was surprised.</p>

  <p>The Red Demons were also stunned.</p>

  <p>There were very few creatures on the Night View Island that could catch the bone spear Tate had thrown.</p>

  <p>Also, all of those who could catch it relied on Treacherous Beings to do it for them.</p>

  <p>Zheng who caught the bone spear lifted the Magic Camouflage Skin and smiled. "I just wanted to watch..." he said.</p>

  <p>When the Red Demons and the Glede Demons saw him and the other human beings, they were stunned again.</p>

  <p>Tate and Bacchus were the most surprised.</p>

  <p>How could they not, when they knew more about the Ghost Mountain than Decker did?</p>

  <p>Decker had only seen Zhurong, and that was because only Zhurong had occasionally appeared over the years.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Ghost Mountain, however, there were still dozens of human beings!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Ghost Mountain had recognized three humans as the Great Ghost Priests of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Both Bacchus and Tate dreamed of becoming the Great Ghost Priests, and that was why Bacchus collected the Arcana like mad.</p>

  <p>The truth behind it was if he became the Great Ghost Priest, he could fuse with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, and become an invincible entity on the Night View Island.</p>
