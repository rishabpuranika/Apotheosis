  <p>
</p>

  <p>Being tricked and trapped in the Fishing Drum by the Grandmaster of Heaven filled Othniel with hatred and anger.</p>

  <p>In a rage, he activated his bloodline power in an attempt to break free from the Heart-piercing Lock.</p>

  <p>He was the master of the truth after all!</p>

  <p>Was this guy so powerful that he could defy even the truth?</p>

  <p>Othniel was unconvinced; he didn't believe such a ridiculous freak existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>He had been trapped for some time when something flashed in the distance and another figure flew in. It was Zheng.</p>

  <p>He appeared to still be unconscious, floating aimlessly in the space.</p>

  <p>Othniel sighed helplessly as he looked on at this new trophy of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Even with no Chaos Ancient God to support them, the Nihility race had still come out of this battle totally victorious.</p>

  <p>As Othniel was growing more and more upset, Zheng suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng's real body was still in the Oneness Sky Palace when he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting from the Grand Plain Stage. He had his concerns for the Oneness Sky Palace but assumed not too much could happen in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>However, he opened his eyes to find that he was not in the Flow Sword Sect, but in some strange space.</p>

  <p>If circumstances were normal, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace would not move him.</p>

  <p>If they were left with no choice but to move him, they must have suffered something catastrophic.</p>

  <p>These thoughts began racing through his mind when he felt there was someone behind him. He turned around and saw Othniel.</p>

  <p>"Mount?" Zheng queried, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The Othniel in front of him was in human form and looked exactly the same as the Mount he had encountered before. Naturally, at a glance, Zheng recognized him as Mount.</p>

  <p>"No, you're not Mount. You're much stronger. You are the Chaos Ancient God Othniel!"</p>

  <p>This person before him had an aura incomprehensibly stronger than Mount's. It was impossible for him to have improved his strength to such a level, no matter how fast he worked. Zheng knew the relationship between Mount and Othniel very well and so quickly surmised that this was in fact Othniel in front of him.</p>

  <p>"So what?" snorted Othniel.</p>

  <p>He treated Zheng as simply the loot of the Grandmaster of Heaven. They were trapped here with no possibility of getting out and so he reacted unpleasantly in his unhappiness.</p>

  <p>"Where are we? Why am I here with you?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Othniel glanced over at him with a hint of pity in his eyes. It seemed as though Zheng still didn't understand the situation he was in.</p>

  <p>"This is a space treasure," said Othniel flatly, "the space treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven to be exact. He's trapped you here!"</p>

  <p>"The space treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven?" Zheng's face changed and his voice trembled slightly with nervousness. "The Grandmaster of Heaven! He's descended to the chaos?"</p>

  <p>Zheng knew Fuxi had handed the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits over to the Black Ship, but would the Grandmaster of Heaven really descend to the chaos so soon? "Did he land at the Bloom Divine Province?"</p>

  <p>This change in Zheng brought joy to Othniel's heart. He then couldn't help himself and blurted out, "Bloom Divine Province? The Oneness Sky Palace is gone. How could he possibly have landed on the Bloom Divine Province!"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace is gone?" Zheng's face darkened and his voice seemed distant, lost in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"My guess is that anyone left from the Oneness Sky Palace is dead. I wonder whether the two old fellows: Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, have died. You know what, they're probably dead too..." Othniel said mockingly.</p>

  <p>Zheng burned with anger at these words.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected such a horror to befall the Oneness Sky Palace once he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"Anger is useless. Even I can't break free from the Heart-piercing Lock and all you can do is stay here and do nothing," Othniel remarked as he stretched his hand out and pulled at the chain at his chest which sealed the space truth.</p>

  <p>"Heart-piercing Lock?" Zheng looked down at himself and said, "I don't have any chains on me."</p>

  <p>"What?" Othniel exclaimed perplexed.</p>

  <p>He then realized Zheng had been unconscious and so the Grandmaster of Heaven probably didn't think about it too much when he threw him into the Fishing Drum. Zheng was not trapped by the Heart-piercing Lock.</p>

  <p>But...</p>

  <p>As fast as this little glimmer of hope appeared, it disappeared just as quickly.</p>

  <p>The Fishing Drum itself was also an extremely powerful space treasure.</p>

  <p>Even if he was in his best condition, it would still require some great theurgies to break it. This was impossible for Zheng with his current strength.</p>

  <p>He might be able to break the Heart-piercing Lock for him, but the lock was under the Grandmaster of Heaven's control. The slightest movement would alert him so that wouldn't work either.</p>

  <p>Both Othniel and Zheng observed each other closely.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw the subtle changes in Othniel at this news; he could see how eager he was to escape this place!</p>

  <p>He thought it through and asked, "Does the Grandmaster of Heaven carry this Fishing Drum on him?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," answered Othniel.</p>

  <p>"If I help you get out, can you take care of the Grandmaster of Heaven?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, serious and hopeful.</p>

  <p>Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were enemies too. Since he had trapped Othniel, it must mean they were against each other.</p>

  <p>"You? Get me out? I think you've underestimated this place," Othniel said with a cheeky smile. He believed it impossible for Zheng to pull it off. But his eyes festered with hatred and he said, "But if I do get out, I'll tear that guy to pieces, no doubt!"</p>

  <p>"Underestimated?"</p>

  <p>Zheng then unfurled a finger and waved it gently and a hint of space fluctuation spread from his fingertip.</p>

  <p>Othniel rolled his eyes when he felt it.</p>

  <p>As the Son of Truth in charge of the entire space in the chaos, anyone using the space theurgy in front of him was but a jester juggling before a king.</p>

  <p>This human brat knew who he was and still dared attempt this. He was too full of himself.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your energy. You can't break the Fishing Drum," Othniel said disdainfully.</p>

  <p>But then, a ripple appeared in this strange space inside the Fishing Drum.</p>

  <p>The entire space sank in towards Zheng's fingertip and then spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Othniel's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Ordinary beings would not have been able to understand what he had done, but Othniel was so sensitive to space that he immediately understood that he had changed the state of the space within the Fishing Drum in an instant!</p>

  <p>He was actually capable of controlling a top space treasure quickly and effortlessly.</p>

  <p>This was not something a human should be able to do!</p>

  <p>Even he could only break the Fishing Drum by force. Controlling the space treasure from the inner space would take ages!</p>

  <p>"Now do you believe that I can get you out?" Zheng asked solemnly. "I can help you remove those chains as well, but you have to help me deal with the Grandmaster of Heaven once you're out."</p>

  <p>"You can break the Heart-piercing Lock too?"</p>

  <p>Othniel was still in shock, and truthfully, a little confused by all this.</p>

  <p>Although he still did not believe it, this time he was not so highly skeptical as he was before.</p>

  <p>"It'll be easy."</p>

  <p>With a blank face, Zheng approached Othniel. The ancestry-level bloodline in his body began to surge and the three chains disintegrated at his fingertip.</p>
