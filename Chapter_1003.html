<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the life vitality was condensed at its maximum, it would slowly liquefy. For the Life and Death Realm warriors this was a very smooth process.</p>

  <p>But tonight Ning Yudie just couldn't get the hang of it. Her mind was distracted. She couldn't focus on her task so she kept failing.</p>

  <p>It was very dangerous for her to cultivate in this state of mind. Anything could go wrong in the martial arts cultivation and she could get seriously injured. Most warriors would choose to stop cultivating under such circumstances until their minds were in the right place again.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie was very persistent and while her mind was wandering she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her lower abdomen. She lost control of a strand of life vitality which suddenly charged up. As this small wisp of life vitality got out of control, it caused the rest of the life vitality in her belly to become erratic.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie tried to calm herself down and stabilize her life vitality with slow and steady breathing. Unfortunately it was already too late.</p>

  <p>The life vitality shot upwards uncontrollably, piercing through her elixir field.</p>

  <p>She felt the taste of blood in her mouth.</p>

  <p>She spat it out, realizing that if a wisp of life vitality had penetrated her elixir field it would cause damage to her belly. The elixir field was also the core and most fragile part of a warrior's body and it would still be severely destroyed even after being partly damaged.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie tried to control the life vitality in her belly as she swallowed the pills. Slowly she started to feel better. The pills had taken effect but didn't change her complexion. Her face was still as pale as before.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie decided to stop cultivating for a while because she was not able to focus on her tasks. She walked to the window and looked at the bright moon and noticed there were just a few stars in the sky. Suddenly, she noticed that one of the stars had a peculiar orange glow.</p>

  <p>"What kind of star is that?" Ning Yudie frowned. She could feel that the light from the star was coming from far away and was shooting towards the Cloud Hall. It seemed like someone in the Cloud Hall had triggered the power of the star. She wondered how this was possible. In astonishment she decided to get closer. Her body gently floated from ground and suddenly disappeared from the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not overthink things like Ning Yudie and Mu Ning. Right now he focused on releasing his perception into the universe to communicate with the stars. He had tried many times to communicate with the stars before but failed almost every time. On his first attempt however, he had been successful.</p>

  <p>But failing for so many times had affected him.</p>

  <p>Compared to other cultivation methods, the Transcendent Divine Might was much more difficult than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Tonight, Zheng's consciousness successfully activated a star. It was a beautiful orange star. It irradiated a gentle and calming glow. Most importantly, it didn't resist Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>With every extra star activated, the power of the Stellar Body became stronger. There was still a gap between Zheng's strength and Eddie's. Even though they hadn't fought each other, Luo Zheng believed his strength would match Eddie's very soon. If he continued to activate stars, it would not be long before he could kill Eddie.</p>

  <p>While he was practicing the Stellar Body, Zheng's body was covered in a layer of faint purple light which was the same light that covered a purple star he had already activated. That was his first star. Now, Luo Zheng had successfully activated a second star and became covered by its orange light. As the two different lights intertwined with each other, a layer of magical colorful light appeared around Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was observing Luo Zheng standing on the roof from afar. "It's really him!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>She wondered how Luo Zheng was able to absorb the power of the stars. Maybe he studied a powerful cultivation method she hadn't heard about. Now that she knew it was Luo Zheng who triggered the power of the star, she became even more curious.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's thin face from afar, Ning Yudie sighed with emotion, her head deep in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>In just two years this young man had stepped from the Illuminating Soul Realm to the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Even though Luo Zheng was only in the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he had killed Emanuel who was no match for him. Ning Yudie was afraid that Zheng's strength was growing strong too fast matching hers quickly.</p>

  <p>She also guessed that he might have suffered a lot in the past two years.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie really wanted to approach Luo Zheng and talk to him. She suddenly thought of Mu Ning and held back her impulses. She sighed and sadly murmured, "I'd better talk to him next time. It doesn't feel like the right time." Then she quietly retreated into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The next morning, Mu Ning paced back and forth in front of Zheng's room.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng appeared, she looked at him with a smile.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had suffered through intense changes. She now seemed to be a completely different person.</p>

  <p>In the past, Mu Ning was arrogant and had a commanding attitude towards everyone. But now, whenever she met him, she would become a completely different person.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, in her heart, she was thinking of Luo Zheng as the one she could stay with and rely on for the rest of her life. Luo Zheng however didn't seem to think the same. After seeing Mu Ning, Luo Zheng quickly glanced at her and kept on walking towards the depths of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for what had happened in the underground palace, Luo Zheng would've chased Mu Ning away. He had already left her behind once in the Fire City, so now he couldn't do it again.</p>

  <p>All he could manage was to try and tolerate her as long as he had to.</p>

  <p>Feeling Zheng's indifference, Mu Ning pursed her lips. She didn't feel angry nor mad at him. Instead, she smiled in a silly almost childish way and followed Luo Zheng. She knew Luo Zheng didn't like when she talked a lot, so she just kept quiet.</p>

  <p>As they arrived at the meeting hall of the Cloud Hall, they could hear the whispering voices of all the elders that had arrived earlier.</p>

  <p>"It is a tragic situation. Eddie has gone mad. He even killed those mortals who can't cultivate!"</p>

  <p>"Those independent warriors are not good people at all! They are just a rabble. They would kill everyone without mercy given the opportunity!"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the innocent warriors who stayed in the Ethereal City had to endure such danger!"</p>

  <p>All voices went silent as soon as Luo Zheng and Mu Ning stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked in, Morphens approached him as if about to say something, but fell quiet as soon as he saw Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Zheng asked when he saw the hesitating expression on Morphens's face.</p>

  <p>"The Ethereal Spirit Sect has been attacked by the Heavenly Evil Sect!"</p>

  <p>Morphens finally responded.</p>

  <p>The news wasn't a surprise to Luo Zheng, but he couldn't help but frown his eyebrows in anger. Mu Ning however was astonished at hearing this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had teamed up before with the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit to set up a trap to kill Eddie. They never expected that Eddie would be so strong.</p>

  <p>His true strength was beyond their imagination and the attempt was a complete failure. Now, since Eddie and Simon, who were Life and Death Realm warriors, were the leaders of the Heavenly Evil Sect, it was only a matter of time before the Heavenly Evil Sect destroyed the Ethereal Spirit Sect. After all, it was difficult for Xander of the Ethereal Spirit Sect to resist their attack on his own.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been attacked and destroyed for quite some time. However, since the transmission arrays had been damaged, it took a long time to spread the news out from the Ethereal City. Until today the Cloud Hall members had no idea of its destruction.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stood blankly without moving and looked at Morphens. "Then, what about the Ethereal City? Is there any news about the Ethereal City?"</p>

  <p>Morphens looked at Luo Zheng. "Please tell us the truth," Luo Zheng said deeply.</p>

  <p>"In order to repay those independent warriors, the Heavenly Evil Sect destroyed the entire Ethereal City and the city members have been massacred. The entire city has been plundered and the top seven noble clans were exterminated," Morphens spoke frankly.</p>

  <p>"The seven noble clans? Are you sure that all the seven noble clans have been exterminated?" Mu Ning asked with a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>There were seven influential third-grade clans in the Ethereal City, namely the Lin Clan, the Huang Clan, the Chang Clan, the Xu Clan, the Xiao Clan, the Chen Clan, and the Xi Clan. The Xi Clan occupied a leading position among the top seven noble clans. Mu Ning didn't dare ask directly about the Xi Clan. It was too painful to even think about the destruction of the noblest clan.</p>

  <p>Aware of what she meant, Morphens went straight to the point. "The Xi Clan has also been attacked. I've heard that the Xi Clan was their major target and that the Heavenly Evil Sect wouldn't rest until they were all gone. All members of the Xi Clan have been slaughtered, and the Xi clan's castle has been burnt to the ground!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning couldn't believe it. Her legs felt weak and she felt like she was about to faint after hearing Morphens' words. She knelt on the floor and stared in the distance with two glassy eyes. Streams of tears flowed down her face.</p>

  <p>She never believed such a large Ethereal Spirit Sect could be attacked and destroyed so easily. In Margaret's eyes, her great-grandfather, Xander, was invincible. The Ethereal Spirit Sect had existed for tens of thousands of years and it was known as the Top Sect in the world. Now it had been completely destroyed. It was gone just like that.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Cloud Hall couldn't help but shake their heads while seeing the miserable, helpless expression of that young lady. Suddenly Ning Yudie also walked in the hall and coldly announced, "I just received news that a group of Xi Clan members is on its way to our Cloud Hall now."</p>

  <p>"The Xi Clan? That means that there are survivors?" Hearing Yudie's words, Mu Ning felt hope again, and showed a glimmer of excitement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie replied, "Yes. They will arrive today. I might need your cooperation this time."</p>

  <p>"Cooperation? What do you mean?" Mu Ning asked again.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie felt that her answer would be too cruel. So she decided to let Mu Ning face the facts and accept the situation when the time was right.</p>

  <p>She said flatly, "You will know as soon as they arrive here."</p>
