<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Previously, Kincaid had used "Elder Xue" to calm everyone down, including the human spirits in the Bold Conjecture House and the people in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, these people were all smart. Leaving aside the question of whether or not Elder Xue was still alive, Geoffrey had a very slim chance to even find Elder Xue in the Deep Space, not to mention get the other weapon.</p>

  <p>But hope was still hope no matter how small it was. They rarely mentioned Geoffrey these days, but everyone was obviously worried about him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although Tianming only received a slight response, they immediately surrounded him.</p>

  <p>Tianming could clearly feel the Lone Sword vibrate for the second time, then for the third time, and then the fourth time... He deciphered the message according to the rhythm and put it into words.</p>

  <p>"I'm... coming... back..." he said.</p>

  <p>The people on the jadeite platform looked at each other with joy.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked Tianming directly, "Is Geoffrey bringing Elder Xue back?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was eager to hear the answer, but everyone remained silent because they were afraid that they would disturb Tianming when he was receiving the message.</p>

  <p>After a while, Tianming said, "No."</p>

  <p>Disappointment was apparent on everyone's faces. Zheng frowned but said nothing.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, however, asked, "Has he seen Elder Xue yet? Did he get that object?"</p>

  <p>Although everyone no longer had any expectations, they still stared at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming felt quite awkward to be the focus of everyone's attention, but he threw all these trifles to the back of his mind when he received Geoffrey's message. He said happily, "He's seen Elder Xue and obtained that object..."</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>Everyone on the jadeite platform burst into excited cheers.</p>

  <p>The three Chaos Ancient Gods weren't an exception. In their excitement, the dens that held their huge bodies were also swaying.</p>

  <p>The people living in the Pear Hill even felt that the mountain was shaking.</p>

  <p>"Shh, he's still talking," Tianming said.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was still a little merry with joy a moment ago but now, although everyone was extremely excited inside, they were all silent.</p>

  <p>"I've already obtained the Heavenly Ring Staff. Elder Xue can't enter the main world and can only stay in the Deep Space. I'm going back to the chaos with Master Ziya now." Tianming continued to deliver Geoffrey's words.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others were surprised to hear this.</p>

  <p>After spending a brief while at the holy pillar to transmit news, Geoffrey and Ziya began their journey back to the chaos.</p>

  <p>The chaos was still quite a distance away from the holy pillar. In the past, Geoffrey had to drag Ziya along the way.</p>

  <p>Now that Ziya had completely adapted to the main world and Geoffrey's strength had greatly increased, they were naturally able to return at a much faster speed. The two of them jumped down from the top of the holy pillar like two nimble swallows gliding down.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>A few hours later, the two of them had returned to the grassland where they stayed before.</p>

  <p>After they passed through this grassland and crossed a river, they would be able to enter a large mountain where the entrance to the Deleting Space was located.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when the two of them were flying across the grassland, a strange sound suddenly came from below.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...</p>

  <p>There seemed to be many slender things flying speedily across the grassland. Geoffrey and Ziya sensed them almost at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What are they? Snakes?" Ziya frowned.</p>

  <p>Although he had already gone through the Soul Reincarnation, he needed to resist the pressure of the Abstruse Energy World, so he didn't release his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"No, they're those tentacles," Geoffrey replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they won't be a problem for us then." Ziya nodded.</p>

  <p>Ziya had also killed those tentacles-like creatures in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>They weren't that powerful.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The tentacles flew above the grassland for a while, but then they suddenly flew towards Geoffrey and Ziya.</p>

  <p>Ziya's expression changed in an instant. There were probably hundreds of thousands of them. When they simultaneously flew towards the two of them, they looked just like a black cloud that rose to the sky.</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>Ziya pulled out his God Lashing Whip and swung it down fiercely.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>Countless whip shadows flew out, looking like golden lights that shred the tentacles they came into contact with into pieces.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the God Lashing Whip was formidable, those tentacles still maintained their vitality even after they were shredded into pieces. Ziya had already seen their amazing vitality in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>While Ziya was busy beating those tentacles, Geoffrey only raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and ordered, "Destroy them."</p>

  <p>As some power in Geoffrey's body was drawn away, two huge mirrors suddenly appeared in this world. One appeared under Geoffrey's feet and flew downward, while the other one appeared on the ground and flew upward.</p>

  <p>In mere seconds, the two mirrors merged together, forming a thin line.</p>

  <p>The thin line grew short at a lightning speed before vanishing completely.</p>

  <p>Of course, everything caught between the mirrors vanished along with them.</p>

  <p>Ziya, who witnessed this, gulped and said, "This ability is too overbearing..."</p>

  <p>In the chaos, Ziya had seen all sorts of incredible techniques and weapons, but they were all nothing compared to the Heavenly Ring Staff in Geoffrey's hand. The Heavenly Ring Staff was the real supreme weapon.</p>

  <p>After the tentacles were removed, they continued their journey back. They had to go along a river before they could finally enter the mountain.</p>

  <p>Although he had left for quite a long time, Geoffrey still remembered the way back clearly. He took a path down at the mountainside, went a few hundred feet forward, and then stopped in front of a mountain wall.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Although it was Ziya who had dug and created the cave in the Deleting Space, since he didn't go through the Soul Reincarnation before, he didn't know about its concrete location and had to get in and out by tying himself with a rope before.</p>

  <p>Ziya went towards the direction Geoffrey pointed in, but to his surprise, he only found a cold mountain wall. "Geoffrey, do you forget the entrance? It's not here..."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" Geoffrey looked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>He stepped forward to look for the entrance. His expression became more and more baffled. "This is impossible! There is a stone step here, and we should be able to enter the cave by stepping on it. The stone step still exists, but is the cave gone?"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Geoffrey was so certain about the path he showed, Ziya realized that something must be wrong.</p>

  <p>The two of them kept walking around the mountain wall and searched all over the area, but they still couldn't find the entrance!</p>

  <p>"The entrance has disappeared," Geoffrey said as he looked at the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>"It took me a long time to dig this entrance, and it has never disappeared since then. Could we perhaps be mistaken?" Ziya suspected that they might have come to the wrong place.</p>

  <p>"No!" Geoffrey said solemnly and then made a light leap. While facing the mountain wall, he said, "Since the chaos is within this mountain, I just have to create an entrance!"</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Geoffrey now had the power equal to the power of the Fostering race's top warriors.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't use all his power when he launched this punch, it was still so powerful that the entire mountain range was shaking. A huge crack was created on the mountain wall in front of them. A huge hole gradually appeared in the middle of the crack. Nevertheless, this cave-like hole wasn't really deep. The deepest part of the hole was still mountain rocks.</p>

  <p>The passageway that Geoffrey expected to appear was nowhere to be seen.</p>
