<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2570 Dispute Among The Same Race </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Even until now, Doran remained unconvinced. "Doran, our race has activated the Cave of Wildness to let us cultivate so we could enhance ourselves and win the battles against the Yellow Emperor race. Zheng is much stronger than you," Romeo advised.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Nine Li race rarely gave Chiyou's blood to a warrior of a foreign race. The only exception was when the race was facing a strong enemy.</p>

  <p>Romeo was the one who recommended Zheng to the race, but he himself didn't know that Zheng was actually a member of his race.</p>

  <p>However, Doran's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Stronger than me?" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>After all, he was one of the most outstanding warriors in Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>He just might be a little weaker than the others such as Elsa and Romeo, and he admitted that he was inferior to them in both talent and bloodline.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng was only a warrior from the wilderness and Chiyou's blood was not inborn to him.</p>

  <p>Doran was much more powerful than warriors of the same cultivation level from the wilderness. He could deal with five warriors of the same cultivation level from the wilderness at the same time.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Zheng had a very weak Wild God Power in his body. He was clearly only a beginner in cultivating the Wild God system, and he didn't absorb much of the wild bones. Thus, Doran couldn't believe that Romeo said that Zheng was stronger than him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right. He is stronger than you and maybe even me," Romeo answered seriously.</p>

  <p>He had killed two of the enemies back in the battle in the Immemorial Wilderness, but this was all because of Zheng. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had much chance of defeating anyone from Yellow Emperor race. More importantly, Zheng had also defeated one of the enemies before he helped him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't say anything more, Romeo was sure that he might even be able to kill the three warriors from the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I don't believe it! Hey, you!" Doran exclaimed as he pointed at Zheng. "I won't leave the Cave of Wildness unless you can defeat me!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng felt rather helpless. He didn't expect to cause trouble even in just finding a training place.</p>

  <p>Giacomo looked at Doran dimly. Even the prominent figures in the race who seldom appeared in front of the clansmen had to worship Zheng. His bloodline was unprecedented. Even the Grand Elder was much inferior to him in terms of the purity of bloodline. What the hell was Doran doing to humiliate their race?</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Wild God Power hidden in his body became too overwhelming. It seemed that he would kill Doran any time.</p>

  <p>'He is so powerful!' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He stood beside Giacomo so he naturally felt thrilled and pressured.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the elders of the Nine Li race who practiced the Wild God system were also the most powerful ones in the world.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he had just entered this world and had recently seen a Wild God who stood thousands of miles tall in the Immemorial Wilderness. If he had the same cultivation base as Giacomo's, would he also become a giant of the same size?</p>

  <p>Now, ordinary people would flinch in fear if they saw an enraged Giacomo.</p>

  <p>Doran, however, was stubborn and arrogant since his mother was an elder of the race. He even dared to talk back. "Elder Giacomo, since you are partial to a foreign warrior, I won't be convinced even if you kill me!</p>

  <p>My mother will seek justice for me if you kill me!"</p>

  <p>"Let me see how your mother will seek justice for you!" Giacomo sneered. With a murderous glint, he waved his hand and was about to kill Doran.</p>

  <p>"Elder Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>"Elder Giacomo!"</p>

  <p>Both Romeo and Zheng shouted and blocked Giacomo's way.</p>

  <p>After all, they were of the same race. If Giacomo insisted on killing Doran, it would inevitably hurt the harmonious relationship among the clansmen.</p>

  <p>Then again, Giacomo was an elder and a senior who clearly felt disrespected when a junior of the race didn't listen to him and even questioned his decision. He was in a dilemma, and he finally decided to kill Doran.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice interrupted the fight and said, "Giacomo, you are an elder. Don't bully a junior! Don't you think it's too much?"</p>

  <p>They all turned their heads and saw a woman dressed in a yellow robe, who stood not too far away. Her face was covered with a thick layer of frost.</p>

  <p>"Mother!" shouted Doran.</p>

  <p>His face quickly lit up with joy at the sight of her.</p>

  <p>The woman was Elder Celia of the Nine Li race, Doran's mother.</p>

  <p>Elder Celia was a warrior with a cultivation level higher than Giacomo's.</p>

  <p>She had made many contributions to the race, and was highly protective of her son.</p>

  <p>"Elder Celia, don't you know who this man next to me is? I was ordered to come here and arrange Zheng to cultivate in the Cave of Wildness, but your son refused to accept my orders. How can I explain it to the Grand Elder?" Giacomo said coldly.</p>

  <p>"That man? Isn't he just a foreign warrior from the wilderness?" Doran mocked. A smug smile was plastered on his face because of his mother's presence.</p>

  <p>Elder Celia gazed at Zheng and said, "I heard that even the Blood Stone can't measure out the purity of his blood. He is the grandson of the Grand Chieftain and has the imperial-grade bloodline. As a member of the Nine Li race, I'm willing to devote myself to the grandson of the Grand Chieftain."</p>

  <p>After that, she respectfully bowed to Zheng.</p>

  <p>In turn, Romeo and Doran were dumbfounded, as well as Baldwin and others.</p>

  <p>They had no idea what the imperial-grade bloodline was, but they knew the Grand Chieftain.</p>

  <p>As the exiles of the Nine Li race multiplied, they also passed on the stories about the Source World to their descendants.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of legends about the Grand Chieftain and they were very familiar with them— they worshipped the Chiyou statue every time they went in and out of the Nine Li race's territory. To them, Chiyou was a spiritual totem. No one could dirty him and no one dared to do him dirty.</p>

  <p>Now they were all extremely shocked when Elder Celia announced that Zheng was the Grand Chieftain's grandson.</p>

  <p>"What...what the hell is going on?" Romeo looked at Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Zheng needed to have a blood transfusion and that he shouldn't have come to the Cave of Wildness so soon, but he didn't expect that Zheng himself had Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>It was too coincidental and exaggerated to be believable.</p>

  <p>"Mother, what do you mean?" Doran hissed in a low voice. If it wasn't his mother who had said Zheng was the Grand Chieftain's grandson, he would never have believed it.</p>

  <p>Elder Celia paid no attention to her son and continued, "However, we must win the battles against the Yellow Emperor race and take over the Sky South Bone Tower. The five warriors who will participate in the battles must be the elite members of our race. Zheng's cultivation base is still low, and there are only three months left. I'm afraid he won't be able to take over my son's position in three months. Why don't we wait for three months and then let him cultivate in the Cave of Wildness?"</p>

  <p>She was still partial to her son as evidenced by her words, which suggested that even if Zheng had a pure bloodline and a high status, he was still weaker than her son.</p>

  <p>"My mother is right. If he were to take over my position, I'm afraid he would be smashed into meat paste in one second," echoed Doran.</p>

  <p>Giacomo couldn't help but shake his head. It really gave him a headache whenever he had to face the unreasonable mother and son duo.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a smile tugged at the corners of Romeo's lips as he said,</p>

  <p>"We'll know whether he has the strength or not after a fight. Elder Giacomo, do you think it's a good idea to ask Zheng and Doran to duel?"</p>

  <p>Yet before Giacomo could say anything, Doran hastily said, "I agree.</p>

  <p>Zheng, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that even though they were all members of the same race, they were involved in so many conflicts. In the end, he could only nod helplessly and say, "I agree."</p>
