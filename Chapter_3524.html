<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just then, the black bear was sent into the air, feeling as if the world was spinning around him.</p>

  <p>When he landed, he noticed that he was thrown near that delicate human girl. This excited the creature.</p>

  <p>Sure, the human man who'd just thrown him into the air was powerful - but there was no way this measly girl could match him. The perfect prey, he thought.</p>

  <p>What the black bear didn't know, was that the girl in his sight was Feng Ge, who was frighteningly powerful even when only relying on her physical strength. If Zheng hadn't relied on the Chaotic Source Spirits, he wouldn't even be a contender against Feng Ge on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>A cold expression flashed in Feng Ge's eyes. All of a sudden, she waved the sword in her hand. The hemline of her dress, which was made of light, fluttered and emphasized her gracious figure.</p>

  <p>Her petite body burst out with immense power, and her skin appeared transparent enough to see the blueness in her veins.</p>

  <p>"Chop!"</p>

  <p>The treasures the Oneness Sky Palace had on Stage Fourteen were too weak, including the sword Feng Ge was holding. How could it bear such a powerful strength?</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge struck her sword, the blade broke into hundreds of fragments.</p>

  <p>Just then, the moon-shaped sword radiance had managed to form. It wrapped around the fragments, and came straight towards the black bear!</p>

  <p>At first, the black bear was planning to keep the girl hostage and run away.</p>

  <p>He had no idea that she actually had such immense power, power that proved to be a lot more intense than the man's.</p>

  <p>At this point, the black bear was shocked and at the same time, confused about what was happening now.</p>

  <p>How did these two humans appear in the first place?</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>In one swift movement, the sword radiance Feng Ge slashed out hit the black bear's chest with great precision, slicing him in half.</p>

  <p>After the job had been done, she lightly tapped the ground and her body retreated instantly, making sure to avoid the black bear's body that was gushing out blood left and right.</p>

  <p>The area around the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was usually rowdy and noisy.</p>

  <p>But at the sight of Feng Ge's battle with the bear, the Other Shore creatures all grew silent, as if they had reached an agreement with each other.</p>

  <p>On the circular terrace, the Souls of Light from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race stood motionless and speechless. They felt bitterness fill their hearts.</p>

  <p>"That Feng Ge had entered the Chaotic Source World the same time as we did..."</p>

  <p>"How in the world did she become so powerful when she just entered Stage Fourteen! There's no way her strength in the Source World can be stronger than mine!"</p>

  <p>"What about the other human? The man named Tianxing? He's very likely to actually be Zheng. Do you think he's stronger than you though?"</p>

  <p>Some of these warriors had entered the Chaotic Source World with Zheng and Feng Ge, while some had been staying on Stage Fourteen for a long time, like those senior members of the Land of Sword Grief. They had heard about the battle between Zheng and the Evil God, making them quite knowledgeable of his existence.</p>

  <p>They were concerned if Zheng would be finally killed or not. But to some other Other Shore creatures, now that Zheng had killed the black bear, it probably meant something else.</p>

  <p>There were many Other Shore races residing in the Myriad Spirits City. But there were only three forces that could actually control the city, namely the Dark Bear race, the Giants, and the Guide Weasel race. In the past, the Giants had taken absolute control in the Myriad Spirits City, but now, the powers were divided.</p>

  <p>In recent years, the Dark Bear race suddenly rose in power. As they grew stronger and won a fierce battle, the City Guard House fell into their hands in the end. At this point, the leader of the Dark Bear race became the governor of the City Guard House, which made him almost the ruler of the whole Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>He said that he could represent the law of the Myriad Spirits City, and this was no lie.</p>

  <p>If killing the Ghost Scorpion could cause a commotion underground in the northern part of the city, then the death of the governor would most probably shake the entire Myriad Spirits City!</p>

  <p>Not too far away, three members of the Guide Weasel race were filled with excitement, their eyes gleaming.</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel race had once been a large group on Stage Fourteen, but over the past years, they had struggled to defeat the Dark Bear race.</p>

  <p>Squeak, squeak... "Look how the Dark Bear race lost today!"</p>

  <p>"Humph! All these years, the Dark Bear race only won because they relied on the support from the upper stages! Now they definitely got what they deserved!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems like these two humans are very powerful, but they're just passing by Stage Fourteen. Maybe we should just support them! I will report to our leader! You two stay here!"</p>

  <p>With a whooshing sound, one of the Guide Weasels rushed out. He transformed into a streak of light and disappeared at the corner of the street.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Guide Weasel race, the other Other Shore races also began to move.</p>

  <p>The news of the City Guard House's defeat spread out quickly all throughout the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a look at the wooden building, then turned towards the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>"This building is too shabby to be the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace," he told them with much concern. "Do you have any suggestions about where we can find a better place?"</p>

  <p>At this point, the Ear Mice were all very giddy. Since the governor of the City Guard House was dead, it put an end to the Dark Bear race's rule over the Myriad Spirits City. Hence, they would all embrace a new era from today.</p>

  <p>"This place really isn't fit for the Oneness Sky Palace!" an Ear Mouse responded respectfully. "I might know a place that could be perfect." The Ear Mouse smiled, glad that it could help Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Well then, please lead the way," Zheng said, gesturing towards the Ear Mouse with his hand.</p>

  <p>"If you two would prefer it, you may take rides on the giant mice!" an Ear Mouse offered in delight.</p>

  <p>A free ride was so tempting that Zheng and Feng Ge couldn't refuse. They leapt onto the giant mice and rode them like horses.</p>

  <p>Though the two giant mice seemed ferocious, they were trained very well by the Ear Mice. They carried the two humans with utmost caution as they walked steadily out of the small path. Eventually, the group had walked along the widest road in the Myriad Spirits City and reached the end.</p>

  <p>Because there were countless races in the city, no matter who was appointed the lord of the city, it would cause a quarrel among the many large races on the Other Shore. There was no pleasing everyone. Eventually, they had come up with a compromise and accepted the system of the City Guard House. And in fact, the governor of the City Guard House was the lord of the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>The reason why the black bear was able to rule the City Guard House was because he relied mostly on his powerful strength and continuous support from upper stages on the Other Shore. Without these advantages, the Dark Bear race were nothing.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and Feng Ge headed towards the City Guard House, the forces in the Myriad Spirits City could hardly sit still.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ear Mice had completely taken over the underground cave in the northern area of the city.</p>

  <p>This was possible only through force. The Ear Mice got rid of all the creatures that tried to resist, like the Tail Insect race and the other scorpions.</p>

  <p>With the help of the giant mice and other mice that had very strong combat abilities in the Myriad Spirits City, they were able to successfully take over the place. Once the Ghost Scorpion died, his subordinates were just a group of weaklings.</p>

  <p>The stench of blood and rottenness filled the entire underground world in the north of the city. At this point, the Ear Mice had plundered all the savings of the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>When the Dark Bear race had learned that their leader was murdered, they quickly reacted. They even started to gather the strong warriors of their race to go against Zheng and Feng Ge. But before they could set out, they were killed by the joint attack of the Giants and the Guide Weasel race. Even the members of the Dark Bear race that guarded the City Guard House had been slaughtered.</p>

  <p>So when Zheng and Feng Ge arrived at the entrance of the City Guard House riding on the giant mice, the members of the Guide Weasel race were already there, all lined up to greet them respectfully. The stench of blood still permeated the air.</p>
