<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Martial Province was located at the top of the Source World. It was the biggest exit from the Source World to the chaos.</p>

  <p>In the past, the exit of the Heavenly Martial Province had been very bustling and prosperous. The flying ships of trade groups from various races had passed through it to engage in commerce. After all, it was much faster to travel through the chaos than through the crystal walls of those provinces.</p>

  <p>However, after the Evil God took control of the Source World, he issued a ban that affected all those making a living in the area. No race in the Source World was allowed to go out without permission; otherwise, they would be killed.</p>

  <p>Because of this, most of the trade in the Source World stopped, and even if they were to trade, they could only take the routes within the Source World.</p>

  <p>At the huge exit of the Heavenly Martial Province, there were tens of thousands of merchant ships docking.</p>

  <p>The people in charge of the flying ships grew depressed. The longer they stayed, the more divine crystals they would lose. They could not do anything about their situation.</p>

  <p>"How long is the ban going to last?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? According to our patriarch, the Source World is now being controlled by a human being named the Evil God. He can lift the ban whenever he wants."</p>

  <p>"Why? Have all the Eternal Realm masters in the Source World died?</p>

  <p>Why are they giving him so much power? How could a young man of the human race be so arrogant?" someone shouted, being very indignant.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the Eternal Realm warriors were the top-level masters in the Source World, and the Evil God was at most at the Holy Soul Realm. How could someone of his stature control the Source World?</p>

  <p>"Shh!" one of the warriors said, making a gesture with his pointer finger. "Don't talk nonsense. I have heard that the Evil God is lurking everywhere."</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! Even the Eternal Realm warriors can't do that, let alone a Holy Soul Realm warrior. Do you think the Evil God is at the Eternal Realm?</p>

  <p>Do you really dare say he has surpassed those who are far greater than him?" one of the people in the area said, devoid of fear.</p>

  <p>Obviously enough, the man did not believe the Evil God could be so powerful.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Other Shore environment had changed, there had been no sign of an Eternal Realm warrior appearing in the world. The newcomers were destined not to reach the Eternal Realm. They couldn't surpass the Eternal Realm warriors; therefore, that man thought that the Evil God being there was nothing but a rumor told to instill fear within the public.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished talking, the body of the warrior in front of him suddenly shook, and his face became blurry.</p>

  <p>As the warrior continued to shake, his body, appearance, and aura began to go a drastic change. None of them knew how this was happening.</p>

  <p>Soon, from the warrior's body, a new Evil God appeared.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stared at the man with a scornful smile and asked, "The Eternal Realm? Tell me, what is that?"</p>

  <p>The man who made those rude remarks earlier was left shocked, unable to throw out his words. He stammered, "You, you, you... You are..."</p>

  <p>"I'm the Evil God," the Evil God said, completing his sentence.</p>

  <p>"I... I didn't mean to... Don't kill me..." the man begged, making it more difficult to control his urge to cry. He didn't expect for the Evil God to truly be able to hear all that was being said from every corner of the Source World. He feared he had realized this too late.</p>

  <p>"Why should I kill you?" The Evil God showed a puzzled expression. It was difficult to determine if it were genuine or not.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to kill me?" the man asked, a glimmer of hope sparkling from within his heart. "You are a broad-minded man. Please don't take my words seriously." he continued.</p>

  <p>The Evil God chuckled at him. "I won't kill innocent people indiscriminately, especially when I need more people. But I will possess your body," he uttered, coming toward the man.</p>

  <p>"Possess..."</p>

  <p>The man's body began to tremble, and his face began to blur. In the blink of an eye, he had become the second Evil God.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God did have the ability to monitor all the creatures in the Source World, it was still considerably large, requiring an enormous amount of effort from him. There were countless creatures in it. If someone cursed the Evil God, the Evil God would not be able to find the culprit from all those who were there.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Evil God happened to come to the Heavenly Martial Province to deal with the heads outside of the Source World, so he naturally heard the two's ongoing conversation on the flying ship.</p>

  <p>When the others on the ships saw this scene, they couldn't even dare to breathe. They did not want to attract the Evil God's attention. If their bodies were occupied by the Evil God, who knew whether they would come out of the possession dead or alive?</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God did not have the intention of possessing other people's bodies. Instead, he looked at the Heavenly Martial Province's exit leading to the chaos. This was the weakness of the Source World. The speed at which the heads bit and devoured things was very fast, and they nearly bit through the Heavenly Martial Province.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>At this time, a harsh biting sound came from near the exit. The sound was incredibly loud, and every time it was transmitted, the entire Heavenly Martial Province trembled.</p>

  <p>"What's that sound?"</p>

  <p>"Creatures in the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"Are they attempting to enter the Source World?"</p>

  <p>The people of different races on the flying ships discussed in a hushed tone.</p>

  <p>The Evil God waved his hand at the trade groups. "All the flying ships, retreat."</p>

  <p>When the people on the flying ships heard the Evil God say this, they did not even dare to stay any longer. They steered their flying ships and retreated immediately, desperate to get out.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The sound near the exit was getting louder and louder, and the Heavenly Martial Province quaked more and more violently.</p>

  <p>Unlike the others, the Evil God did not try to rush out of the Source World rashly. It was not because he was timid. It was because it was unnecessary for him.</p>

  <p>It was abnormal for these heads to appear in the chaos all of a sudden. The Evil God's intuition told him that this was not a simple matter. He knew he had to be more cautious in dealing with this.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The exit of the Heavenly Martial Province finally collapsed.</p>

  <p>The flying ships of the trade groups opened their shields at the same time, trying to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>They had traveled around the Source World for a long time and were very familiar with the environment of the chaos. Once the exit collapsed, a large amount of chaotic energy would surge in. They opened their shields to block the chaotic energy coming to engulf them.</p>

  <p>However, what they didn't know was that the chaos clouds in the entire chaos had disappeared, being replaced by the huge heads.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the moment the exit collapsed, it was not the chaotic energy that surged in, but fierce heads.</p>

  <p>After they devoured the outer wall of the Source World, their bodies expanded in a second. Each head was one million feet high, like a mountain flying in the air, and these heads were off to bite people.</p>

  <p>"About two hundred heads are invading the Heavenly Martial Province!" someone screamed.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The two Evil Gods raised their hands at the same time, and the Ways-blending Energy gathered upon their palms.</p>

  <p>A trace of space truth enveloped the Ways-blending Energy. After a few moments, the Ways-blending Energy disappeared from the hands of the Evil Gods and appeared right in front of the two heads.</p>

  <p>These heads could not discern the matters of the outside world. They only had one purpose: eat!</p>

  <p>They would devour both energy and materials. If it were possible, they would surely even devour the void!</p>

  <p>Facing the sudden Ways-blending Energy, the heads swallowed it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Explode!" the two Evil Gods commanded at the same time.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy exploded. A blazing white light flashed from within the mouths of the heads, causing them to explode into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>Cheers came from the flying ships in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Two huge heads have been killed just like that!"</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God's face darkened.</p>

  <p>He had planned to kill all the heads with the explosion created by the Ways-blending Energy, but the strength of these heads greatly exceeded his expectations! He had underestimated them greatly.</p>

  <p>About two hundred heads were no threat to the Source World, but the Evil God knew there were more of them coming. There were probably millions of heads crazily biting on the outer wall of the Source World. Their number was increasing exponentially!</p>

  <p>He knew that if he did not stop the heads, the entire Source World would be bitten into pieces.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God thought of this, the two hundred or so people on the flying ships began to convulse, and their features began to disappear from their faces. After a few seconds, they all turned into about two hundred Evil Gods, raising their hands to release bursts of Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy appeared in the mouths of about two hundred heads. This destroyed them in an instant, and shards from the rupture of the heads fell to the ground at a dramatic rate.</p>
