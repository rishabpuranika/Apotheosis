  <p>
</p>

  <p>Until now, the other Royal Monkeys remained seated on the horseback as their eyes cast playful looks below.</p>

  <p>At the top of their group was Linus. The impact of the blow was enough to pulverize Zheng into bits of flesh.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Insect Masters immediately felt frightened and scampered away in all directions when they saw Linus jump down. "Run! Right now!" the old insect raiser shouted at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He ran towards Zheng's direction as he yelled, and then pushed the latter away in order to take the blow instead.</p>

  <p>Yet, all the Insect Masters were very clear that no matter what they did, Zheng and Elvinia would definitely die.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng held on to the old insect raiser with one hand, and reached upward with the other.</p>

  <p>When Linus saw that Zheng had tried to grab his long stick with his bare hand, he couldn't help but laugh mockingly. Zheng was a lunatic. Not only was this guy from nowhere so arrogant, but he was also stupid!</p>

  <p>'This blow is enough to smash him into a pile of mud. How dare he take it with his hand?'</p>

  <p>While Linus thought about it, the long stick had already touched Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng grabbed and pulled the stick. Suddenly, his right arm released its strength and stopped the stick from falling.</p>

  <p>The other side of the stick endured Linus' power. The entire stick curved like an arch bridge, but it didn't break.</p>

  <p>"The stick is good," Zheng praised.</p>

  <p>Linus stared dumbfoundedly at Zheng, not knowing what just happened.</p>

  <p>Just then, the stick turned and Linus felt a burning pain in his hands. Zheng had taken the stick away!</p>

  <p>A painful tremor hit Linus' chest right after, and it turned out that the stick had pierced through his breastbone.</p>

  <p>The stick started to spin, and Linus' burly body spun as well. A strong surge of Other Shore Power travelled along the stick and as it spun some more, Linus' body collapsed.</p>

  <p>Zheng grabbed, pulled, and turned the stick. In three simple movements, Linus ended up dead. The whole process took only a few seconds.</p>

  <p>To top it all off, Zheng's other hand was even holding the trembling insect raiser!</p>

  <p>The whole col was silent. After all, the Insect Masters didn't think that the two strange visitors who came from far away were terribly powerful, and were able to kill Linus so easily.</p>

  <p>Of course, Mercer and Miller lit up with joy. They knew that Zheng was a powerful cultivator, but they were still surprised at the strength he had just shown.</p>

  <p>Unlike them, however, the Royal Monkeys above the col did not look happy. Their horses smelled the tangy odor of blood in the area and didn't dare to move.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had killed Linus so easily, it meant that his strength was far beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>Zimba was the quickest to react. He pulled the horse's mane and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The Royal Monkeys quickly tried to escape but the second they did so, Zheng cried out, "Since you're back, how could you still want to leave?"</p>

  <p>"You can't stop us!" Zimba turned around and angrily shot back at Zheng, who was in the col. This time, however, Zimba's horse suddenly let out a neigh because it was too nervous and terrified.</p>

  <p>Another horse had thrown out the Royal Monkey that sat on it due to its anxiousness.</p>

  <p>The horses in the Dark Region were by no means ordinary. In fact, the horses the Royal Monkeys rode were Demonic Blood Horses. They were incomparably strong and had immense fighting power, and there were very few things that they were afraid of.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zimba was confused. His eyes narrowed into slits, and then he saw a human woman who stood in front of the horse.</p>

  <p>He was still puzzled. Why could this human woman scare his horse to such an extent?</p>

  <p>Before Zimba could find out the reason, he saw the woman spread her hands, and two beams of blazing white light shone brightly.</p>

  <p>Zimba looked at the white light with fear.</p>

  <p>As a Royal Monkey, he had spent so many years in Stage Fourteen. He had met the stage ruler and witnessed the Great Sanskrit Light. He clearly knew that everything that the light illuminated would vanish without a trace, as if they had never been in this world.</p>

  <p>He was also aware that the Great Sanskrit Light had purified the west part of the Dark Region some time ago. Thus, everything within a hundred-mile radius of it was completely gone.</p>

  <p>There were many rumors that attempted to explain the situation. Some said that it was the stage ruler who had done it, while others said that there was something wrong with the stage.</p>

  <p>When Zimba saw the white light that came from the human woman's hands, he put the pieces together and came to a realization.</p>

  <p>It seemed that it wasn't the stage ruler who had done it, but rather a new purified being who was in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zimba did not have the chance to bring the news back to his race.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The moment Elvinia flicked her fingers, the white light had touched the horses and the Royal Monkeys. The light swept around only a few times, but the Royal Monkeys and the horses were cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>This ability of Elvinia enabled her to make them disappear without a trace.</p>

  <p>She, however, had already consumed too much of her power before and had been restraining herself since she entered the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>After Zheng climbed out of the col, the Insect Masters followed one by one.</p>

  <p>They stared numbly at the chopped up body parts on the ground, as they never thought that such a thing would happen. The two humans in front of them had killed the superior Royal Monkeys! Who on earth were they?</p>

  <p>"Clean this place up," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Several insect tamers took out small round boxes and released a swarm of black bugs. The numerous tiny bugs looked like a mass of black sand as they covered the corpses of the Royal Monkeys and the horses.</p>

  <p>They had eaten up the bodies in no time, and even the bloodstains on the ground were gone.</p>

  <p>"Even if we have cleaned this place up, I'm afraid the Royal Monkey race won't let us go," said one of the Insect Masters with a bitter look on his face. "We will die in a couple of days," Mercer wailed miserably.</p>

  <p>More than a dozen Royal Monkeys had died. It was highly possible that the Royal Monkey race would vent their anger on the Insect Masters and kill all of them.</p>

  <p>"It won't happen," Zheng comforted.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Mercer asked. "Because all of the black monkeys will die," Zheng replied calmly. There were some things that he might concede to, but threats to him that involved Yan were not something he could allow.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of force stood behind these black monkeys, he would never give in to them.</p>

  <p>Despite his words, the Insect Masters still looked uneasy.</p>

  <p>Although he and Elvinia had just killed more than a dozen Royal Monkeys, the Royal Monkey race had many other masters.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng had already sensed the Shape-shifting Spirit's direction, so there was no need for him to stay any longer. He and Elvinia decided to continue their pursuit.</p>

  <p>Just as the two of them were about to leave, Mercer and Miller plucked up the courage to ask Zheng if they could follow along.</p>
