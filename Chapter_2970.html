<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even Ramzi, an outsider, was familiar with the Slaughtering Moonlight Array.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards were well aware of the power of this array.</p>

  <p>They knew from experience what damage could be done.</p>

  <p>The silver moons shimmered. Without warning, an invisible force leaped across the space between.</p>

  <p>A sharp, earsplitting crack sounded.</p>

  <p>As the invisible force sped towards the Trumpet Flying Ship, a pale purple light appeared on the surface of the vessel. An enchanted barrier had been raised.</p>

  <p>This enchanted barrier was the main protection of the body of the ship.</p>

  <p>Normally, the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm would find it difficult to pierce the barrier without extended time and effort. However, as Emily chopped the air, the barrier trembled and seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>

  <p>Another crack sounded.</p>

  <p>The invisible force went deeper, piercing through the shield to touch the exterior of the ship. A thin, clear line appeared in the middle of the ship from the force of Emily's blow.</p>

  <p>Within, several Yellow Emperor Guards groaned in horror as lines whipped across their bodies, leaving behind a trail of broken arms and legs.</p>

  <p>Two unlucky Yellow Emperor Guards didn't even have time to react before a thin line split their bodies in half. They died instantly, their souls and inner worlds cut off without warning.</p>

  <p>The carnage was terrifying to Telmo and the other Yellow Emperor Guards, who didn't dare to stay in the danger zone anymore.</p>

  <p>They fled in all directions, trying desperately to avoid the thin lines.</p>

  <p>Telmo felt like he was choking on his bitterness. He saw that the Slaughtering Moonlight Array was brutal and merciless in attacking and killing the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>If another opponent took the initiative to attack him, he would definitely question them and check their identity at the same time.</p>

  <p>The hard reality was that he was virtually defenseless against the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. His only choice now was to stay alive, no matter what.</p>

  <p>"Run! Run in every direction! Save yourselves!"</p>

  <p>Telmo warned the other Yellow Emperor Guards with his life vitality while he was escaping.</p>

  <p>But there was still a problem. Telmo knew it was possible for the Slaughtering Moonlight Array to seal the space.</p>

  <p>It didn't even matter at this point what the enemy intended. The actions they had taken made it crystal clear that they sought to kill every Yellow Emperor Guard they could.</p>

  <p>Given enough time, the Slaughtering Moonlight Array would probably succeed in killing every single one of the ten or so Yellow Emperor Guards in the ship.</p>

  <p>At first, Telmo felt hopeless. But as he evaded the slashing lines, an idea came to him. Was there a way out of this situation? Perhaps time could save them.</p>

  <p>After all, the bottom of the Source World wasn't desolate. Telmo realized that the other party in this battle wouldn't dare to continue the fight if it dragged on for much longer. If they failed to kill the Yellow Emperor Guards within a short period of time, they'd have no choice except to retreat.</p>

  <p>Emily, meanwhile, was still busy. She let out a cry of energy.</p>

  <p>Her arm moved, slashing towards a Yellow Emperor Guard floating in the void. There was a flash. The body split into two, dead in an instant.</p>

  <p>Telmo was right. Emily had indeed planned this surprise attack as a quick and unstoppable way to kill all of the Yellow Emperor Guards in the space.</p>

  <p>It came as a surprise to her that the Yellow Emperor Guards immediately chose to flee at the first attack from the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. She had expected them to stand their ground while she cut them down.</p>

  <p>Emily knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep track of everyone trying to escape. Even if she sought to chase them one by one, it would take too much time. If they called in stronger reinforcements, then she would be the one at a huge disadvantage.</p>

  <p>She made a decision. "Let's go! The Trumpet Flying Ship has been destroyed." Clearly, she had decided not to hunt down the fleeing Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Leopold nodded. He agreed with her judgment of the situation. He quickly removed the Slaughtering Moonlight Array and activated the jade plate.</p>

  <p>They began to accelerate, leaving the Yellow Emperor Guards and their ship behind in space.</p>

  <p>As Emily and the others vanished, Telmo finally slowed down. He heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>But beneath the relief at his survival, hatred and anger boiled inside Telmo.</p>

  <p>He flipped his hand. Immediately, Yellow Emperor Magatama appeared. As soon as it was activated, he spoke, his voice ringing out loudly.</p>

  <p>"Attention! At the bottom of the Source World, a Trumpet Flying Ship has been captured by the outsiders!" He repeated the message and then added,</p>

  <p>"They are heading north, and I guess they will enter the Source World through the Wild Goose Pass. This is urgent! They have the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. I hope that our mighty Yellow Emperor Guards can defeat them once and for all."</p>

  <p>It was through the Yellow Emperor Magatama that Yellow Emperor Guards were able to communicate with each other over long distances.</p>

  <p>The device could spread the news over a broad area at the bottom of the Source World. Within this range, all Yellow Emperor Guards would be able to receive the news.</p>

  <p>At one part of the bottom of the Source World, there was a triangular gap named Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>To get into the Source World from this region, the nearest entrance was the Wild Good Pass. Missing it meant that the travelers would have to journey for several months more to find the next entrance to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Telmo felt sure that Emily and her companions would try to enter the Wild Goose Pass. It was the only logical option.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a huge black ship drifted slowly into the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>The enormous ship was easily a million feet high, like a moving mountain.</p>

  <p>A colossal pavilion was perched on the top.</p>

  <p>Inside the pavilion, standing at a corner window, a young man in white picked up his Yellow Emperor Magatama and heard Telmo's urgent warning.</p>

  <p>He was surprised and slightly disbelieving. "Could this be true?" he muttered. "Some outsiders have kidnapped a Trumpet Flying Ship? And even worse, they have the Slaughtering Moonlight Array?" The young man mulled over these developments.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he activated his Yellow Emperor Magatama. He said, "How much information do you have on the enemy? Who would be so bold as to kidnap our Trumpet Flying Ship? Reply to me as soon as you can."</p>

  <p>The young man in white understood that it had to be something very serious. He knew that only the esteemed members of the Sky Guard Pavilion were qualified to use the Slaughtering Moonlight Array.</p>

  <p>A voice came through. "Excuse me, who are you?" Telmo was on the other side, responding to the man's call.</p>

  <p>The young man in white replied, "This is Sanjay."</p>

  <p>As Telmo heard the name, his spirits lifted. With enthusiasm and respect he said, "Master Sanjay, it's you! I am honored to have made contact with you."</p>

  <p>Sanjay was among the most well-known and highly respected people of the Sky Guard Pavilion. Telmo had heard of him and admired his successful ventures.</p>

  <p>Quickly and in great detail, Telmo relayed to Sanjay what had happened and what he had seen. He concluded by saying, "It is my judgment that they will choose to enter the Source World through the Wild Goose Pass. This means they will be there in a day, maybe a bit sooner."</p>

  <p>Sanjay listened closely. "I see," he said, already thinking ahead. "Then they will find us waiting for them."</p>

  <p>He ended the conversation, and the light on the Yellow Emperor Magatama dimmed.</p>

  <p>He got up. He paced for a moment, thinking, and then he went to the door and left the room.</p>

  <p>This ship was not among the fleet of the Yellow Emperor Guards. It belonged to a trade caravan of the Source World, where Sanjay had hitched a free ride.</p>

  <p>He could no longer stay here. The urgent events of today and the impending arrival of the enemy had made it impossible for him to just stand by. He would have to make preparations for battle at the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>Inside their own ship, Emily and the others had convened. They all wore serious expressions, for they knew the plan had to be adjusted.</p>

  <p>"We have the advantage since the Yellow Emperor Guards don't know who we are," said Zheng. "Yet they will definitely see us and treat us henceforth as their enemy."</p>

  <p>Leopold nodded. "If I were them, I would try to predict our next move. I wouldn't give up. That means they know we will try to enter through the Wild Goose Pass."</p>

  <p>Zheng agreed with him. "Are there other options? Could we take another route?" he asked. Zheng faced Emily, to whom he had directed the question.</p>

  <p>Emily looked deeply conflicted. "The path is already the most desolate one, the one which will be safest for us. But I didn't expect to meet the Yellow Emperor Guards so soon, given the vastness of the Source World."</p>

  <p>Now the element of surprise was lost, and they were in a dilemma. They would have to guess and counter the movements of the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Everyone waited silently as Emily analyzed the situation and considered alternatives. Finally, she said, "We will take the Wild Goose Pass. At this point, any change in our route will lead to months of delay and possibly even more accidents."</p>
