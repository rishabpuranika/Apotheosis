<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were too many secrets between life and death.</p>

  <p>There weren't many martial artists in the universe that specialized in the Life Law. This Life Law could bring the dead back to life but it wasn't so deadly.</p>

  <p>As a result, of the three queens of the Demon Night, Ying was the weakest.</p>

  <p>The Heart Eating Insects were considered a powerful weapon when they were used to deal with Soul Sea Realm ace talents. However, when used to fight against Supreme Lords they were useless. The Supreme Lords knew many ways to restrain the Heart Eating Insects.</p>

  <p>Ying had also used her life energy to nurture other plants to fight.</p>

  <p>Ying was the only one in the entire universe who cultivated such powerful Circle of Life and Death. It was a cultivation method she achieved when she cultivated the Life Law.</p>

  <p>So when Shania displayed the Circle of Life and Death, the Supreme Lords knew immediately who she was.</p>

  <p>That was an ability that only someone with a really strong life energy could possess.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Circle of Life and Death was not a method of attack.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Shania's one hand released a dense amount of life energy, while her other hand released a dense amount of death energy.</p>

  <p>When she unleashed both powers at the same time, Shania was dragged into a state of life and death.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also dragged into this state.</p>

  <p>This was called the Life-or-Death Space.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would enter the Life-or-Death Space would fall into a very unique state.</p>

  <p>A state in which they were both dead and alive.</p>

  <p>In the Life-or-Death Space, to take a step forward meant to live and to take a step backward meant to die.</p>

  <p>Creatures would fall into an extremely difficult situation and their souls would be tormented.</p>

  <p>This kind of state would also affect Shania. Even as one of the queens of the Demon Night race, she would still suffer this torment. However, she was proficient in the Life Law and was constantly exploring the profound mysteries of life and death, so this wouldn't affect her as much as it would anyone else. To her opponent, however, it was extremely disadvantageous.</p>

  <p>This was the same as when a martial artist who cultivated the Ice Law dragged their opponent into the Land of Extreme Chillness. Both of them would face great pressure, but the martial artist that cultivated the Ice Law would naturally find it much easier.</p>

  <p>The vigorous life energy fused with the thick death energy began to rotate within the Heaven Earth Board turning into a gray fog.</p>

  <p>Standing in the mist, Luo Zheng could feel a sense of serenity growing within him.</p>

  <p>His body suddenly started to feel heavy and sluggish.</p>

  <p>He was actually feeling tired.</p>

  <p>The need for battle and courage to fight were disappearing.</p>

  <p>Negative emotions slowly started to creep in, and a feeling of impending doom slowly spread through him.</p>

  <p>Shania stood quietly in front of him like a dusty Equinox Flower. She looked bright and beautiful, but her real face could not be seen through the haze. A faint smile hung on her face, and a strange look appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"To be able to maintain a clear mind and soul in Life-or-Death Space, that's outstanding. No wonder Xun is willing to follow you. She is a fool, but she is not stupid. She still has good eye."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Shania walked towards Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng was standing with a clear and firm mind, and a resolute warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists that were caught in the Life-or-Death Space would be overwhelmed by a sudden fear of death.</p>

  <p>This fear was something that many martial artists couldn't escape.</p>

  <p>To the martial artists, death meant returning to zero and that everything that mattered and that they cared about would disappear.</p>

  <p>The fear of death would be strong or weak depending on the strength of the person affected by it.</p>

  <p>Some people saw death as a natural thing, so they would be less affected by it. For people that had nothing to live for, it was better to die.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if someone was obsessed with this world, then the impact of the fear of death would be greater.</p>

  <p>Zheng's attachment to this world was strong, very strong.</p>

  <p>He was determined to find Yan, who was outside the heavens. He was determined to pursue greater power and to protect all the people he loved. These were all the things that he wanted to fight for, so he had to remain alive at all costs.</p>

  <p>As the fear crept in, Luo Zheng fought hard to resist it.</p>

  <p>But the longer he stayed in the Life-or-Death Space, the stronger his fear became.</p>

  <p>The lines and stones on the Heaven Earth Board slowly began to disappear.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's feet there was an endless abyss, and he was standing on a thin line above this abyss just about to fall.</p>

  <p>The stronger the obsession with this world, the more afraid one would be of death.</p>

  <p>"I can't die... I can't die! Not today!"</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Shania, on the other hand, was calmly staring at him. The Life-or-Death Space was a test of one's determination to live.</p>

  <p>The stronger the will, the stronger the backlash.</p>

  <p>Anyone's own state of mind would be completely shattered by his own obsession.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>But instead of falling into the abyss before him, he sped towards Shania.</p>

  <p>The fear in his heart was real and it was not an illusion. This life and death experience that was forcefully being applied to his heart felt real as any other feeling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no way to resist or escape the fear. His only way out was to kill that fear before it grew any stronger and led him to commit suicide.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was decisive in his attack.</p>

  <p>But Shania was quick in her response. She placed her hands behind her back and with a grin on her face, just like a dragonfly touching the water, her toes tapped on the thin line several times and she instantly retreated a thousand feet. Her move was quick, gracious and effortless.</p>

  <p>"It's no use to fight or to try to destroy me. Your warrior spirit is indeed strong because you have a strong obsession. But you know that the stronger the obsession, the more intense your fear will become. When that fear reaches a certain level..." Shania said as she held out one hand as if she was holding Zheng's heart. "At that time... Bang! Your heart will burst and you will die! You'll be scared to death!"</p>

  <p>In the universe there was a type of illusion, whose method of killing was very similar to Shania's.</p>

  <p>While using this method, one would use the illusion to draw out a realistic picture, causing the opponent to be unable to remove himself from it. In the end, the opponent would be guided towards death.</p>

  <p>But illusions were just illusions after all. They couldn't be compared to Shania's Life-or-Death Space.</p>

  <p>The Life-or-Death Space represented Shania's understanding of life. It was not an illusion and it couldn't be broken.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wanted to survive the Life-or-Death Space, he had to overcome his own fear of death.</p>

  <p>Kurt was quietly sitting on top of a stone. Although he had not been caught in the Life-or-Death Space, the Mu Ning that was emitted by the Heaven Earth Board had attracted him.</p>

  <p>"Amitabha!" Kurt muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He had long regarded Shania as one of his greatest opponents.</p>

  <p>The Life-or-Death Space had no effect on him.</p>

  <p>Buddhist followers had peaceful minds and few desires. They were usually detached from life's desires and attachments. His obsession in life was to sacrifice himself for Buddha. If he was able to transcend life and death, he would achieve his purpose.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for him to give up his obsession.</p>

  <p>Tianming's and Nathan's faces looked just as solemn.</p>

  <p>They might encounter the same difficulties that Luo Zheng was facing.</p>

  <p>The Life-or-Death Space would be a great test for them.</p>

  <p>They needed to think of a way to deal with it beforehand.</p>

  <p>Right now, that fear was like a demon taking over Zheng's will and growing more and more.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was growing more anxious by the second, which made the fear grow stronger. All that Luo Zheng could feel now was a burden in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>The instant he dashed forward, Luo Zheng unleashed all the forceful energy in his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was like a gust of wind trying to get closer to Shania. He was moving at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Shania kept on smiling and moving swiftly. With a twist of her body, she was like a nimble butterfly dancing on a thin line.</p>

  <p>Wandering on the edge of life and death was familiar to her. She had no fear.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng missed his attack, he turned around and the Thunder Wind Divine Sword appeared in his hands.</p>

  <p>But before he could prepare his next wave of attacks, he felt a sharp pain in his chest.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!" Luo Zheng screamed painfully.</p>

  <p>His heart began to contract violently.</p>

  <p>Shania could hear the sound of his heart beating.</p>

  <p>"Ah, what a beautiful sound!" she said happily.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was beating crazily. He had encountered this once in the sorcerer race's secret land.</p>

  <p>But that had been because of the stimulation from an external source, and Luo Zheng had been able to endure it and think of a way to break it.</p>

  <p>Right now, his heart was beating so violently because of his own emotions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept on screaming in pain. His face showed how much pain he was experiencing.</p>

  <p>Shania stood not far away and smiled while she said, "You have a strong heart. Unfortunately, you have an even stronger obsession with survival.</p>

  <p>That will be your end!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a loud crack was heard from the inside of Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart thumped violently once again.</p>

  <p>In that instant, a sweet and fishy taste filled Zheng's throat. He spat out a mouthful of blood and knelt on the thin thread.</p>
