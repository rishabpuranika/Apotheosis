<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2481 Precious Memory </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the other True Gods were so far away from the woman that they didn't hear her.</p>

  <p>Edmond had used spatial transference to dodge the sword strike from the Soaring Sky Sword Array. Reinhard then manipulated the sword array to fly back towards him again.</p>

  <p>When he was midair, he spotted the woman with long hair.</p>

  <p>"Another incarnation of fear!"</p>

  <p>"The aura that this woman is giving off is more terrifying than that of the fiend!"</p>

  <p>"I'm doomed!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan, including Reinhard, were ashen-faced.</p>

  <p>The huge sword shadow also came to a halt. It looked like they had nothing to do but wait for death.</p>

  <p>But what happened next was beyond their wildest expectations.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what the long-haired woman had said to Luo Zheng, but she floated towards Edmond and before anyone could react, smashed his body into smithereens.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard was dumbfounded. So were the disciples of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman had actually cut Edmond into pieces!</p>

  <p>This sudden change was hard for them to accept. A powerful fiend as Edmond had amounted to nothing, just as fragile as a piece of paper before this woman.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Edmond had only been able to utter one word before he was killed, a trace of panic appearing on his huge face.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His mountain-like body was cut open, and his body began to collapse.</p>

  <p>His flesh and bones began to fall and disintegrate.</p>

  <p>His corrosive blood spurted in all directions like a fountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng retreated quickly with Yan in his arms, avoiding the rain of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>Duke was also confused.</p>

  <p>But he managed to escape, given that he still had the desire to survive deep in his heart.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman floated in the air, letting the rain of blood and flesh fall around her. But not a single drop of blood splashed on her.</p>

  <p>At this scene, Atlas, who was hiding in the distance, began to shiver.</p>

  <p>This woman was so much more powerful than he was!</p>

  <p>The only thing he could now do was run away.</p>

  <p>With a crack, he turned into a flash of lightning and disappeared into the mist.</p>

  <p>The woman cast a casual glance in his direction. She didn't intend to chase after him.</p>

  <p>All incarnations of fears in the debate venue would disappear after the end of the debate, including her. So no matter where Atlas was hiding, chasing him would be futile.</p>

  <p>She didn't care about the life or death of these incarnations of fears.</p>

  <p>She had killed Edmond because Yan had been affected by the shadow of Snake Goddess because of him. Killing him had simply been an act to release her anger.</p>

  <p>She would have been okay with leaving Edmond alone if he hadn't done what he did.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman floated over to Luo Zheng as she descended. She looked at Yan with concern in her eyes and said softly, "Let her down."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng still had some doubts about her, he did as she said. After all, this woman had killed Edmond.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he didn't seem to have any other way to save Yan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng obediently lowered Yan on the ground.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman pressed her hand to Yan's forehead.</p>

  <p>A ray of red light spread along her slender fingers.</p>

  <p>And a ray of purple light emerged on Yan's forehead. She was about to resist the red light.</p>

  <p>Although the two lights were of different colors, the auras they were emitting were similar.</p>

  <p>Still, the purple light that Yan was releasing was weaker. After the brief tangle, the purple light retreated quickly, allowing the red light to enter Yan's brain without resistance.</p>

  <p>"Umm..."</p>

  <p>Yan groaned and began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Her breath, that had begun to pick up, quieted down gradually, as if she had fallen into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman, thinking that what she had done wasn't enough, gestured with her fingers, spreading a soft, yellow light into Yan. It looked like she was comforting Yan's soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Yan and the long-haired woman, a strange feeling coming over him.</p>

  <p>They looked almost the same, like twins. She was Yan's and his mother.</p>

  <p>After the treatment, the woman caressed Yan's face affectionately.</p>

  <p>She then stood up slowly and took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The beautiful eyes looked at Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>She was so excited to see her son and daughter, but she didn't know how to express herself.</p>

  <p>"Mother" was a strange word to Luo Zheng. He hadn't expected to meet her under such circumstances.</p>

  <p>He didn't even know his mother's name and surname!</p>

  <p>She walked hesitantly towards him.</p>

  <p>Her shiny black hair spread on both sides of her like satin, surrounding her like a sheet of rain.</p>

  <p>"Can I hug you?" the long-haired woman asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was about to refuse, but paused when he saw her expression.</p>

  <p>Moments later, he found himself nodding.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman walked up to him and took him into her arms.</p>

  <p>Choking with sobs, she said, "I've been waiting for this day for so long. I didn't expect to meet you here of all places."</p>

  <p>She was just an incarnation of fear.</p>

  <p>Her real body wouldn't save this memory, but this incarnation inherited all the memories of her real body, including all her emotions and self-awareness.</p>

  <p>"Why have you been waiting for this day? Yan and I are..."</p>

  <p>If the passage of time in the divine land were to be considered, Luo Zheng had only been born a few years ago.</p>

  <p>"You and your sister had been placed in the Evolutionary Universe a long time ago. It's just that your father arranged for you to grow up in this grand era," the long-haired woman said softly.</p>

  <p>Mike had been experimenting with the previous grand eras in the Evolutionary Universe. And when this grand era had arrived, the two hopeful seeds of Luo Zheng and Yan were finally nurtured and began to grow healthily.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman shook her head. "It seems that your father's arrangements are not necessarily correct. It's because you're lucky. If I hadn't become your incarnation of fear and landed in the debate venue, I'm afraid you and Yan would have been killed."</p>

  <p>She looked like a decisive woman, one who knew what she was talking about.</p>

  <p>She couldn't bear to put Luo Zheng and Yan in such dangerous situations. Going by her words, she seemed to be dissatisfied with Mike's and Harold's arrangements.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng, she was like an ordinary mother who had been wronged.</p>

  <p>She behaved strangely with Luo Zheng, but he still felt a sense of familiarity from the bottom of his heart when he heard her voice.</p>

  <p>"It's been a long time, but it has also passed so fast! You arrived in the divine land in the blink of an eye, and are already strong enough to be on your own," she said, relieved. And then, she raised a finger. "I don't want to forget what happened here. You have to help me keep this memory.</p>

  <p>Return it to me when you see me again."</p>

  <p>A gentle light burst out of her fingertip. It continued to condense and formed a small cocoon of light that hit Luo Zheng squarely between his eyebrows.</p>
