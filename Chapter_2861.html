<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Harold pointed out the crux of the matter. "It is impossible for the Holy Beings to favor Samuel. Because the Holy Beings of the alliance will never let him go."</p>

  <p>Nicholas had been operating in the Time Sea for years. To have survived for that long, he not only relied on his strength but also on mutual interest and prestige.</p>

  <p>After the revival of the Holy Beings belonging to the alliance of the powerful clans, such as the Mu Clan and the Leng Clan, they would exact their revenge on Samuel.</p>

  <p>However, Mike shook his head and said, "I'm afraid the situation is far different from what you thought. Those Holy Beings have come back to life before me. They allegedly gathered on the Floating Island of the Han Clan some days ago, but they didn't take any action."</p>

  <p>Harold and Sword Chen raised their brows slightly in askance.</p>

  <p>Zheng said, "Only one person can suppress the anger of the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans."</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. As expected, Zheng was quick to react.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Harold also understood. "You mean that Yellow Emperor Guard?"</p>

  <p>"They call him Master Hamish," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Hallet inquired, "You mean to say that the Yellow Emperor Guards want to utilize Samuel?"</p>

  <p>Mike nodded with a frown and said, "Nicholas is dead, so the Yellow Emperor Guards can't place their hope on him anymore. If, as you said,</p>

  <p>Samuel has taken control of the Abyss Demon Region, then the Yellow Emperor Guards will need him to remove the Mixed Element Seal. That is our biggest problem." He continued in a serious tone, "Hamish is the weakest among the Yellow Emperor Guards. The Mixed Element Seal that imprisoned him was not complete, so Nicholas could release him. If the other Yellow Emperor Guards are released by Samuel, the consequences will be disastrous."</p>

  <p>Mike, Holy Jay, and Bromley had only taken Hamish into account when they formulated their plan.</p>

  <p>Mike knew nothing about the other Yellow Emperor Guards; he only knew that their strength far surpassed that of Holy Beings and that as adversaries, they were invincible.</p>

  <p>Noticing the dark look on Mike's face, Harold and Hallet glanced at each other. Then, Harold turned to Zheng and said with a smile, "Haven't you told your father the news?"</p>

  <p>"What news?" Mike asked, confused.</p>

  <p>The way that Harold said it, the news seemed to be able to affect the whole situation, but was that even possible?</p>

  <p>"I didn't have enough time to tell you in detail back in the prison on the Ray Tree. Back then, Mother and I were trapped underground..." Zheng proceeded to tell his father what had transpired outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say, the reinforcements of the Nine Li race are outside the divine land?" Mike had always been a calm man, but his raised voice at that moment betrayed his elation.</p>

  <p>He knew exactly what it meant.</p>

  <p>"That is correct," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Good. That is good. Good."</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the hall, Mike repeatedly murmured "good" and let out a long breath. He looked at his son with a meaningful look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He, Bromley, and Holy Jay had racked their brains to make a plan in the Evolutionary Universe. They had pinned their last shred of hope on Zheng in order to resist Nicholas.</p>

  <p>However, what actually happened was completely different from what they had foreseen when formulating their well thought-out plan.</p>

  <p>After all, the whole situation was dynamic; any slight deviation could cause massive changes in the end result.</p>

  <p>Even though Mike was good at planning, it was impossible for him to predict all potential scenarios and have everything under control.</p>

  <p>What he did not count on was that Zheng messed up the plan of the alliance because of a measly mouse. This unforeseen circumstance caused Nicholas' premature demise even before the growth of the other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Neither did he expect Gregorio to be reborn and eventually replace Nicholas in controlling the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, what surprised him the most was the fact that Zheng had left the divine land and brought back those masters at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"We should go and meet up with them," said Mike, "but for now, I'm going to see your mother."</p>

  <p>With those words, he left.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others watched his receding back with smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult for him to solve the problem of Lorena and Joy.</p>

  <p>On top of the Lofty Tree, Samuel and Hamish stood on a branch with their hands clasped behind their backs.</p>

  <p>Below them, Pascal sat cross legged, black energy flowing around him continuously.</p>

  <p>"Why is the Mixed Element Seal so powerful? Not even you can remove it.</p>

  <p>Who set such a powerful seal?" asked Samuel curiously.</p>

  <p>He felt a sense of disquiet. Surely the one who was able to establish such a strong seal must have the ability to kill the Yellow Emperor Guards, right?</p>

  <p>With a faint smile flirting with the corner of his mouth, Hamish explained,</p>

  <p>"The Mixed Element Seal is, of course, formidable. A man named Harper Yuan brought us here and activated the seal, but he did not fashion it by his own strength. The Mixed Element Seal had always been in the divine land, and he only activated it. As a matter of fact, the seal was designed by Chiyou himself, so it is extremely powerful."</p>

  <p>"The seal was designed by Chiyou?" Samuel exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>Nicholas learned about the Source World through Lorena, so Samuel also knew a few things about the subject.</p>

  <p>For one, he knew that Chiyou created the divine land. Such a mighty being was simply beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Hamish nodded. "My brother guessed that the only means to remove the Mixed Element Seal lay in the Abyss Demon Region. It appears that he was right."</p>

  <p>In the past, he had tried every means to forcibly remove the Mixed Element Seal, but his efforts proved to be futile.</p>

  <p>The black energy flowing at the tip of Pascal's finger rolled toward the sphere before him.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the energy eroded the exterior of the sphere. It could only leave minute cracks each time, but the Mixed Element Seal would not be able to withstand the continuous damage for long.</p>

  <p>In a day, a pit as thick as an arm had appeared in the center of the Mixed Element Seal.</p>

  <p>After two days, the pit had become much deeper.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the center of the Mixed Element Seal was incomplete, and the pit was all but touching the person inside.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zavier said triumphantly from inside the Mixed Element Seal,</p>

  <p>"All right! Now, ask him to make way for me."</p>

  <p>Samuel nodded. Pascal stopped, jumped slightly, and distanced himself from the sphere.</p>

  <p>Soon after, they felt a strong, domineering aura emanate from the sphere.</p>

  <p>It was as if a gigantic beast was struggling to get out of the seal.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With a loud cracking sound, a fracture appeared in the center of the sphere that held Zavier captive.</p>

  <p>After sounds of breaking and several loud thuds, the Mixed Element Seal finally succumbed to Zavier's power. The eroded middle part of the seal completely shattered.</p>

  <p>A solid figure emerged from the Mixed Element Seal and shot up at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Haha! After so long, I'm free at last!"</p>

  <p>Zavier's wild laughter boomed through the sky with such strength that even the top of the Lofty Tree was swaying.</p>

  <p>He had been suppressed while imprisoned for so many years. Now, he was full of excitement as he savored his long-awaited freedom.</p>
