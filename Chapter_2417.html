<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current speed, it was impossible to completely dodge the rain of swords coming straight at him.</p>

  <p>If he used the jade seal, however, he'd be capable of dodging the rain of swords with ease. After all, those bugs could devour an entire period of time in which Zheng was invincible.</p>

  <p>It was only natural that Zheng wasn't quite so willing to make use of the jade seal that easily.</p>

  <p>Another technique that he could rely on in this moment was the Truth of Cultivation Nature, of course.</p>

  <p>Originally, he didn't want to use the Truth of Godly Way now.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, having come this far, he definitely wasn't going to give up this early.</p>

  <p>As soon as this thought came to his mind, Zheng began to make his move.</p>

  <p>Less than a second later, a tiny strand of Truth of Godly Way began slowly circling around his body.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way wasn't a cultivation method, but a deep understanding of the Godly Way instead.</p>

  <p>If the Truth of Godly Way was combined with any other cultivation method, it would thus have a very magical and unique effect.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng had already tested this himself before.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!" Zheng roared at once.</p>

  <p>After summoning just a hint of Truth of Godly Way, Zheng flew backward with might.</p>

  <p>Right then, he looked like he had no bones in his body whatsoever, as if he were a slowly flowing liquid!</p>

  <p>Even though the flying swords were coming at him extremely fast and were densely packed, they did not form an inescapable wall, after all.</p>

  <p>Directly from the rain of the swords, Zheng penetrated out in a very weird gesture.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, if someone were to stand within the magic array at this very moment, they'd see that Zheng's body had contorted, like a fried dough twist, in a completely inhuman shape.</p>

  <p>On the other hand though, in the eyes of people outside the magic array, there was nothing unusual with this scene.</p>

  <p>"I can see it!"</p>

  <p>A satisfied smile appeared on Zheng's face as he shouted aloud. He identified the Truth Spiritual Sword from the rain of swords and removed it immediately.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had already used the Truth of Godly Way, he no longer hesitated when doing so again.</p>

  <p>He didn't even search for a place to avoid the rain of swords. After fusing the Truth of Godly Way with the Eight Smoky Melodies, he resembled a fish swimming through water, freely shuttling through the rain of swords.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the combination of techniques, his speed of grabbing the Truth Spiritual Swords had increased ten-fold, at least.</p>

  <p>Hayden and Marley were pretty convinced that Zheng would only be capable of retrieving seventeen Truth Spiritual Swords. More so, they were ready to watch him suffer.</p>

  <p>Hence, they did nothing but wait patiently.</p>

  <p>From where they were standing, they noticed a strange wave coming from Zheng's body in the magic array. Before they even had the time to think about what this wave was, Zheng took a step back, and under the buzzing of the few Truth Spiritual Swords on the ground, they floated upward.</p>

  <p>"What? No way! He grabbed the eighteenth one! He must really be suffering great pain with his strong will," Hayden exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Marley wanted to agree with Hayden. He opened his mouth to speak but didn't have the time to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the nineteenth Truth Spiritual Sword flew high into the air.</p>

  <p>"What?" Hayden didn't have the chance to finish his sentence, either.</p>

  <p>The twentieth Truth Spiritual Sword went flying into the air.</p>

  <p>Hayden said nothing more. Simply put, he was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>Marley also looked at Zheng solemnly, although he had a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Before this all started, he had said jokingly that Zheng might be capable of grabbing twenty-three Truth Spiritual Swords, but he wasn't serious. Would Zheng really succeed?</p>

  <p>The three white-robed True Gods in charge of the magic array also widened their eyes. Looking at this strange scene that played out before them, they too, couldn't find the words to speak aloud. They could only watch the Truth Spiritual Swords flying upward, one after the next!</p>

  <p>Although the place had been a little too noisy before, it was now too quiet.</p>

  <p>Many others equally stared at the scene, unable to pull their eyes away, knowing that they were probably witnessing a miracle.</p>

  <p>The twenty-first one...</p>

  <p>The twenty-second one...</p>

  <p>And the twenty-third one!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Looking at the Truth Spiritual Swords, Hayden couldn't help the bad feeling that came over him.</p>

  <p>As it appeared, after Zheng had taken out the eighteenth Truth Spiritual Sword, they began vibrating more frequently, as if they were trying to get away from Zheng. He had them under a tight control though; thus, the swords only swirled around him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng obtained the twenty-third Truth Spiritual Sword, he had reached the end of the road.</p>

  <p>With a thick bundle of long swords in hand, Zheng stepped off the road with a grin plastered on his face.</p>

  <p>The moment he strode off the road, the Truth Spiritual Swords he held onto disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>These Truth Spiritual Swords were only illusory. The real swords were actually circling around Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the illusory Truth Spiritual Swords disappeared, they were actually completely liberated from Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>The real Truth Spiritual Swords circling around Zheng were in a hurry to get rid of him too, and right now, they were flying in every direction in an attempt to flee.</p>

  <p>"Get down! Danger!"</p>

  <p>Hayden shouted out loud before the Truth Spiritual Swords flew outward and caused any harm.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The twenty-three Truth Spiritual Swords circling Zheng now recklessly rushed in all directions.</p>

  <p>All of these Truth Spiritual Swords were considered supreme primordial weapons. There were a total of eighty-seven divine cities with two thousand and one Truth Spiritual Swords in all. Together, they could form the Sword Clan's Sword Singing Array, which was known as an extremely powerful sword array.</p>

  <p>It was only during the period of debate over the Godly Ways that the Sword Clan would distribute such swords. They would assign three True Gods in white robes to establish the temporary magic array in order to test the True Gods.</p>

  <p>When these Truth Spiritual Swords shot out, the speed and power they contained weren't slight.</p>

  <p>Hayden was both smart and quick enough to notice something was wrong.</p>

  <p>He warned the others ahead of time.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods bent their bodies completely in half, and a few of them even rolled on the ground.</p>

  <p>Even the three True Gods in white robes, who were in charge of the magic array, didn't care about their image right now. Not in the least. Fortunately for them, they had been sitting on the ground. All they had to do was lie on the ground as soon as the warning was heard.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The Truth Spiritual Swords scattered, and in a split second, most of them were nailed to the buildings on both sides of the street.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>One of the Truth Spiritual Swords was nailed to the west entrance's thick wooden gate, and the sword's blade shook continuously.</p>

  <p>"Aaaargh!"</p>

  <p>As they screeched at the top of their lungs, two True Gods were stabbed by the swords.</p>

  <p>One of these two True Gods was Rufus Wang, who was the closest to Zheng.</p>

  <p>From his position on his stomach, Hayden glanced at the True Gods who had been stabbed, and he let out a sigh of relief. Neither of them was hit in their vital parts.</p>

  <p>As soon as he let out his sigh of relief, he noticed Rufus Wang, who was lying on the ground, rolling over. He shrank himself into a ball, screaming madly, his face distorted and he looked to be in an extremely horrible state.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" Rudolf Wang, Rufus Wang's younger brother, didn't expect his brother to be in such pain. He hurried over and glared at Zheng before he began to check on his brother.</p>

  <p>"It's the Red Fire Thunder..." A helpless expression appeared on Hayden's face.</p>

  <p>The eighteenth to twenty-third Truth Spiritual Swords had the nature with the illusory swords in the magic array. In other words, this meant that they possessed the Red Fire Thunder. Touching the sword in the magic array was alright, but now that the sword had hit Rufus Wang, it had released the Red Fire Thunder.</p>

  <p>Now that the Red Fire Thunder had penetrated into his body, Rufus Wang would undoubtedly have a hard time.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, stood at the edge of the magic array, still a little stunned.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came out, he saw the Truth Spiritual Swords shooting out, and he felt as though he was at a loss.</p>

  <p>When he came to his senses, the first thing he noticed were the two True Gods lying on the ground.</p>
