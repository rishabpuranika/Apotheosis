  <p>
</p>

  <p>Without wasting any time, Flamine rushed over from the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>When she saw Feng Ge had already woken up, she broke into tears of joy.</p>

  <p>She immediately walked towards Feng Ge and embraced her. At this point, Feng Ge spoke. In a cold voice she asked, "Who are you? Why are you hugging me? Do I know you?"</p>

  <p>Flamine was stunned by this reaction. She looked at Feng Ge and with a questioning look upon her face, she turned to Zheng.</p>

  <p>A little while ago, Zheng had already explained what happened to Yudie and the others. Now, he had to recount the events for Flamine's sake.</p>

  <p>"While we were in the Dark Region, a purified being occupied Feng Ge's soul," Zheng instantly told Flamine.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, Flamine responded to this very calmly. "I am aware of it," she said.</p>

  <p>"You know about it?" Zheng asked. He was thoroughly intrigued.</p>

  <p>Flamine nodded. "The purified being in the Dark Region actually wanted to take Feng Ge's soul away. However, I was able to kill him."</p>

  <p>After hearing that, Zheng finally saw the whole picture. He now understood what had truly happened.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been wondering about why Teague had failed to take Feng Ge's soul, since his soul was so much stronger than hers.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that Feng Ge would die when she fell into the tomb. Much to his surprise, she became a purified being instead!</p>

  <p>"What happened after that?" Flamine asked. She was obviously still confused as she brought her gaze back to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge emerged as she is right now. She has become a purified being and has obtained a new body on the Other Shore. She is now very powerful,"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied while staring at Feng Ge as well.</p>

  <p>With that, a hint of surprise streaked across Flamine's face. She was aware that this would be too troublesome because there was a huge disturbance in Feng Ge's soul. Moreover, she didn't know what would happen next. No one had ever experienced something like this before.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how strong she is now? Is she stronger than you?" Flamine asked curiously and looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"She's a lot stronger and powerful than my body. There is no one in Stage Thirteen that can defeat her. In addition to that, she is able to kill any creature in the Dark Region in an instant," Zheng admitted as he stared back at her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's physical body on the Other Shore was already far stronger than Zheng's. He didn't know whether she could stand against the three-eyed boy and the giant ape. But even if they were stronger than Feng Ge, she had the ability to activate the Great Sanskrit Light. The creatures in the Dark Region had no power to fight back under the light.</p>

  <p>"Will she be able to leave Stage Thirteen?" Flamine continued to ask once more.</p>

  <p>A purified being was a creature from the Other Shore. They usually inhabited and dominated a certain stage. There were purified beings existing in the upper stages of the Other Shore as well.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they could only stay in their respective stages regardless of their strength and power. If Feng Ge could make it to the upper stages, then her identity as a purified being would have absolute significance.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't thought about this possibility before. With that he said, "The moment we left the Dark Region, we withdrew from the Other Shore. We still haven't tried it yet."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Flamine said with a nod. Bringing her gaze back to Feng Ge, she gently caressed her face. "It appears that when I vanquished the purified being, his Soul of Light remained in Feng Ge's soul and merged with her Memory Flame."</p>

  <p>"Is there any way for her to recover from this?" Zheng inquired with unabated curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The Memory Flame is very fragile and complicated. I am sure there is a way. However, the process will be very troublesome," said Flamine carefully.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already borne witness to many Memory Flames before. The Memory Flames in the divine land had created an ocean. Liusu's Memory Flame was once taken out and then given back.</p>

  <p>However, these Memory Flames were complete and intact while Feng Ge's was broken.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace had no shortage of very talented people. They would find a way to fix this problem.</p>

  <p>"Come back to the Phoenix Palace with me. I am extremely worried about you these days," said Flamine to Feng Ge with so much pity and longing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Shockingly, Feng Ge pushed her away and said loudly, "I won't go anywhere with you! I don't even know you! I have to stay with my husband."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'husband'?" Flamine demanded. Her facial expression darkened.</p>

  <p>Even though Flamine had much appreciation of Zheng, her daughter was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Feng Ge was the princess of the Phoenix Palace. How could she call Zheng her husband? With that said, Flamine began to wonder what Zheng had done to her daughter.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Yudie, and the others glanced at Zheng and grinned. Zheng had already explained to them that Feng Ge had been quite dependent on him after she climbed out of the tomb.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt embarrassed by this. Once again, he had to explain it for Flamine's benefit.</p>

  <p>It had been established that Feng Ge had lost her memory. So now, she was much like a six-year-old girl and depended on him by instinct.</p>

  <p>Flamine wouldn't leave Feng Ge here. She was hell-bent on finding a cure for her.</p>

  <p>She proceeded to ignore Feng Ge's refusal. She stretched out her fore finger and gently touched Feng Ge's forehead. This made Feng Ge fall into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>It was true that Feng Ge was invincible on the Other Shore. However, she had no power to fight back against Flamine. And so, she was carried off to the Phoenix Palace by her mother.</p>

  <p>Dorothy also left after she grasped the gist of everything that happened in the Dark Region. However, she appeared downcast right before she left.</p>

  <p>Zheng's return was a cause for celebration. His courtyard house became lively again.</p>

  <p>During the past few days, Yudie and Margaret were severely worried about Zheng. Trish and Carrie felt uneasy as well. They were all tired and dispirited.</p>

  <p>But now that he was back, they felt relieved and excited.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a little guilty that he caused them to suffer over the past days. In order to make up for it, he accompanied them all day long.</p>

  <p>A week later, he chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>Merging with the Civilization Artifact was now his top priority. It was too important to be put off any longer. The earlier he merged with it, the earlier he could feel relaxed.</p>

  <p>In addition to being a powerful Other Shore Token, the Civilization Artifact also contained a flaw of the Godly Ways Great Unity.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Zheng was more interested in this flaw rather than the Other Shore Token itself.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Slowly and steadily, the Truth of Cultivation Nature was spreading inside Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>All at once, the entirety of his inner world became more harmonious and smooth while it underwent this process.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the inner world were unable to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. However, even just the aura released from the Truth of Godly Way would graciously benefit many talented beings.</p>

  <p>With the intention of breaking through under the aura, there were warriors and True Gods with outstanding talent that began to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>During that time when Zheng merged with the Strength God Totem, his inner world experienced an extremely strong pressure. This was the effect of that terrifying Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Compared to that, it was much quieter when he merged with the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>It also looked as though the Civilization Artifact was just an ordinary diamond-shaped handicraft.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the entire Thousand Sanskrit Land trembled the moment it appeared.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words were bathed in golden light as they began to flash.</p>

  <p>A hundred and four Sanskrit words lit up all over the Thousand Sanskrit Land when the Truth of Goodwill and Malice merged with the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>And then, a hundred and forty Sanskrit words lit up during the time that the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent merged with the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>This time, however, a total of three hundred and sixty-six Sanskrit words lit up when the Truth of Cultivation Nature merged with the Civilization Artifact!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With each Sanskrit word that shone, a chain would stretch out.</p>

  <p>And so, three hundred and sixty-six chains shot out. Afterwards, these chains had wrapped around the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. It's possible that the Civilization Artifact is not considered as an Other Shore Token from the Lust World," Zheng murmured as he looked at the Civilization Artifact nearby.</p>

  <p>In principle, the Other Shore Tokens found in the Lust World could be applied to the Hundred Sanskrit Land regardless of how powerful they were. Take the Strength God Totem for example. It was an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen that only needed a hundred and forty Sanskrit words to bear it.</p>

  <p>"Haha..." Zheng suddenly heard a soft laughter.</p>

  <p>It was the Regal Jade Spirit that laughed. The sound came from the Civilization Artifact. It said, "This is the result of us hiding in Stage Thirteen and being suppressed by the rules. Otherwise, even the Thousand Sanskrit Land might fail to bear it."</p>
