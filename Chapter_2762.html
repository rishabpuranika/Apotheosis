<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2762 Under The Black Water </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sword Chen sighed, suddenly sensing something. He talked to Luo Zheng through his life vitality, "Hide your aura! Something is coming!"</p>

  <p>Heeding this instruction, Luo Zheng hid all his aura.</p>

  <p>They floated in the black water, as motionlessly as they could.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng felt a wave emerge from the thick black water.</p>

  <p>He knew that there was probably a huge monster swimming in the black water, swilling the water around and forming an undercurrent.</p>

  <p>The mere manner in which the undercurrent reached Luo Zheng terrified him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart seemed to stop beating in that moment.</p>

  <p>The hair on his back stood on end, and his mood began to fluctuate violently.</p>

  <p>He had tried his best to restrain himself but fear had prodded his instincts.</p>

  <p>And now, he was trying to gather all his strength and hit back.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Sword Chen put a hand on Luo Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>A warm current flowed from his palm and into Luo Zheng's shoulder, causing him to feel immediate relief.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the sudden feeling of returning home, as if he had, all this while, been in a cold, frozen land and then spring had made its appearance again.</p>

  <p>His fear had disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>He had experienced this feeling before, when he had faced fear incarnations in the debate venue. But it hadn't been as strong as it was now.</p>

  <p>The undercurrent disappeared after a while and the monster was also a significant distance away. It was only then that Sword Chen released Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What was that? Is there a monster in the black water?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"No?" Luo Zheng repeated, puzzled. He had clearly sensed a huge monster just moments ago.</p>

  <p>And now, Sword Chen was saying that there was no ferocious monster here! What was Luo Zheng to make of this contradiction?</p>

  <p>"Do you know what the black water is?" Sword Chen asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>He only knew that the black water, like the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, was extremely complex.</p>

  <p>It would weaken all kinds of energy that were poured into it.</p>

  <p>Neither Liusu's fire nor Samuel's spear worked in the black water.</p>

  <p>"This is the Sea of Meditation," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"Sea of Meditation..."</p>

  <p>To the west of the Desperation Plain was the Reincarnation Land. To the East was the black water. This must be the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>But the name didn't matter. Luo Zheng memorized it and waited for Sword Chen to give further explanation.</p>

  <p>"That thing is not a ferocious monster. It is referred to as 'the unknown' in the Sea of Meditation," Sword Chen explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still confused. "What is 'the unknown'?"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen smiled, knowing that Luo Zheng would ask this question, and continued, "Not all fears have forms. What we fear most is usually colorless and formless. It is just a concept. For example, when you suffer sleep paralysis, you feel that something is pressing down on your body, but in fact, there is nothing. What makes you scared is the unknown."</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was a gathering of all the fears in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Like other forbidden lands, all the monsters here had their sources and legends.</p>

  <p>There were fiends, Abyss Demons, sea monsters, and all kinds of ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>They were truly illusory, formed by Faith Energy. However, the divine citizens fabricated them.</p>

  <p>The fears didn't really exist in many cases.</p>

  <p>As Sword Chen had said, some fears were formless.</p>

  <p>Formless fears were also a kind of Faith Energy, and the creatures that were formed by this kind of Faith Energy could be found in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>"So the unknown won't harm us? They'll only scare us?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart fluttered with fear.</p>

  <p>He had experienced life and death. Even in the most desperate situations, he never was scared because he knew that fear was useless and would only push him into adversity.</p>

  <p>But in the face of the unknown just now, Luo Zheng's fear was instinctively awakened, and he couldn't find a way to stop it.</p>

  <p>Without Sword Chen's warmth, Luo Zheng would probably become desperate enough to attack the unknown.</p>

  <p>"Scare us? Ha-ha!" Sword Chen chuckled mirthlessly and then asked Luo Zheng,</p>

  <p>"It is said in the divine land that fiends rule the Abyss Demon Region, right?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it true?" Luo Zheng asked back.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Abyss Demon Region was home to fiends.</p>

  <p>"Even the most powerful fiends shiver with fear in the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>They'd die here if they aren't careful enough. They can be reborn, but once they die, they will have to start all over again," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows went up at this information.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt that hiding in this damned place was not a good choice.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Sword Chen had been hiding here for a number of years, so he must be very familiar with the Sea of Meditation. He could probably ensure their safety to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment and asked, "Why do the fiends come here if this place is so dangerous?"</p>

  <p>The fiends seemed to have lost interest in the Reincarnation Land since they couldn't enter it.</p>

  <p>The Sea of Meditation was dangerous, making it impossible for the fiends to come to it.</p>

  <p>"This is the cultivation place of fiends. If they want to be stronger, they must come here," Sword Chen answered.</p>

  <p>"The cultivation place of fiends? Do the fiends still need to practice?" Luo Zheng became even more puzzled at this.</p>

  <p>The monsters would become stronger and stronger as long as they stayed in the forbidden lands, because they had an inexhaustible source of Faith Energy there.</p>

  <p>Another way of becoming stronger was to devour other beasts, a way in which they could get extra Faith Energy quickly.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it's necessary," Sword Chen said, calming down. "If the fiends only relied on Faith Energy, they wouldn't have the strength they have now.</p>

  <p>They would have been just some obscure monsters. But in the Sea of Meditation, they can come in contact with the most wonderful ideas, some even beyond the limitation of the divine land."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat at this.</p>

  <p>He had heard the strange fish mention that the fiends were looking for a way to leave the Abyss Demon Region. This was impossible, because it violated the rules of the divine land.</p>

  <p>And according to what Sword Chen was saying, did the fiends find the way out of the Abyss Demon Region through the Sea of Meditation?</p>

  <p>The moment Sword Chen finished talking, Luo Zheng felt the pressure around him loosen and he stepped into a space he couldn't quite explain. The black water that had clung to his body peeled and flowed away from him like reeling silk from cocoons.</p>
