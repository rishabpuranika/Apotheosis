<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nearly all of the palace had disintegrated. Only Luo Zheng, Barnaby, Natasha, and the men in black remained intact.</p>

  <p>From the looks if it, Qiu Yinhe only needed to activate a simple command to dissolve them into pieces as well.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood frozen, careful not to make even the smallest movement.</p>

  <p>Barnaby wasn't incredibly inferior to Qiu Yinhe, but his special ability, the Illusory Eye was almost useless during a face-to-face battle. If he really fought with Qiu Yinhe head-on, he'd probably lose to him.</p>

  <p>Natasha was definitely powerful, but not as powerful as Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>The men in black were the backbone of the intelligence agency. They were warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm and they were unable to challenge Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>Since Qiu Yinhe had told them that Gethin had already given up, none of them could resist. They would easily die if they did.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Barnaby withdrew his Illusory Eye.</p>

  <p>The illusion went away and Luo Zheng reverted back to normal.</p>

  <p>He finally saw Qiu Yinhe who was standing not far away. "Master Qiu Yinhe!" he greeted enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" Qiu Yinhe asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and smiled. "I'll be alright," he assured.</p>

  <p>"This is my fault. I did not expect that they'd have the audacity to take you away." Qiu Yinhe shifted his glance towards Natasha and Barnaby and added,</p>

  <p>"Don't let me see Holden again if you don't want him to suffer."</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe couldn't deal with Gethin, but he had his confidence in beating Holden.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Qiu Yinhe said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going, Master Qiu Yinhe?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"To the Mighty Sword Hall. We can't let them think that they can get away easily," Qiu Yinhe replied coldly.</p>

  <p>Then, he grabbed Luo Zheng as they flew up swiftly.</p>

  <p>Barnaby straightened his robe, ensuring that it was crisp and perfect. He realized just how strong Qiu Yinhe had become and how little progress he had been through in comparison in the past few years. Suddenly, sadness washed over him.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to the Mighty Sword Hall, too," announced Natasha.</p>

  <p>Gethin would have never allowed Qiu Yinhe to come. Someone must have forced him to do it.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe took Luo Zheng to have Gethin explain. What they did not know was that Natasha would soon be standing beside Gethin ready to defend her husband.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was brought into the Mighty Sword Hall, Qiu Yinhe sneered.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Gethin, you said with absolute certainty that Luo Zheng wasn't here.</p>

  <p>Then who is this guy?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe tried his best to sound as polite as he could be.</p>

  <p>Gethin had no defense. He merely shrugged his shoulders and acted innocent. "I really was kept in the dark about this." He turned to the others behind him. "Why is he here? Would you know?"</p>

  <p>Ying responded from her golden throne, "Quit playing dumb. You can't save yourself by lying."</p>

  <p>Flamine added, "Emperor Gethin, please explain yourself."</p>

  <p>Gethin's face felt hot. As a man occupying a high position, he wasn't used to being confronted.</p>

  <p>He knew they wouldn't let the matter go so easily.</p>

  <p>Neither Ying, Flamine, nor Qiu Yinhe would let go of this matter just because Luo Zheng had returned unharmed. They needed an explanation from Gethin.</p>

  <p>Despite the pressures, Gethin maintained his calm.</p>

  <p>He kept silent and fixed his eyes on the exit of the hall.</p>

  <p>Natasha came rushing in. She went straight towards Gethin and knelt down in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What's going on, Natasha?" Gethin asked, pretending that he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>"This is all my fault," Natasha cried. "I shouldn't have kidnapped Luo Zheng and taken him to the Vastness Mountain. I only did it to avenge Marco's death.</p>

  <p>I'm so sorry to have caused you trouble!"</p>

  <p>Tears poured down her face.</p>

  <p>"Marco's death? What happened to Marco?" Gethin asked in shock.</p>

  <p>Natasha wiped her tears as she got up on her feet. "He killed him." She pointed at Luo Zheng and went on to tell his husband how their son had died a tragic death.</p>
