<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3774 Sudden Change </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With everyone looking on, Luo Zheng drove the bone plate forward once more.</p>

  <p>He passed the twelfth layer.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth layer...</p>

  <p>The fourteenth layer...</p>

  <p>The fifteenth layer...</p>

  <p>The sixteenth layer...</p>

  <p>He moved inwards for a hundred and sixty feet and finally arrived beside the centipede-like creature.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The small water drops within the sixteenth layer rained down hard on Luo Zheng like a violent storm.</p>

  <p>His whole body was wrapped in the black cracks that tore wildly at his body.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body continued to absorb the battering he took, but they dimmed fast at the same time.</p>

  <p>As the Chaotic Source Spirits dimmed, the Truth of Divine Dao continued to gush out. The warm current was like the water of an oasis in a desert, nourishing everything it flowed over.</p>

  <p>Before the Chaotic Source Spirits fell into absolute fatigue, the Truth of Divine Dao had already restored them.</p>

  <p>'I'll stay here!' Luo Zheng thought to himself, assessing the situation.</p>

  <p>This was a point of perfect balance for him.</p>

  <p>If he continued onward, his Chaotic Source Spirits might not be able to withstand the force. Once they were fatigued, Luo Zheng would not be able to hold on much longer.</p>

  <p>And on the sixteenth layer, he could not only refine his tribulation skeleton quickly, but he could also cultivate the Chaotic Source Spirits at the same time!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Countless small drops of water fell on the surface of his tribulation skeleton, and wisps of golden light swiftly covered it.</p>

  <p>Passing the trial of the Land of Bone Tribulation usually took a long time because the tribulation skeleton would only begin refining on the outermost layer. But as the refining effect was so unsatisfactory on the outer layers, it would take a long time surely to complete the trial.</p>

  <p>In fact, from the sixteenth layer onward, the speed of refining would increase greatly!</p>

  <p>"He... What the hell is he?"</p>

  <p>"He went straight to the sixteenth layer!"</p>

  <p>"If I were there, I'm afraid those little water drops would tear me apart!"</p>

  <p>They had just been thinking Luo Zheng wouldn't last long on the eleventh layer, yet now he stood steadily on the sixteenth layer. Getting there would take most of them a great deal of time but he did it in an instant!</p>

  <p>His speed stunned the Other Shore creatures to their core...</p>

  <p>"Is this real?"</p>

  <p>"How ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>"I finally understand why the Element Spirit race wants him dealt with!"</p>

  <p>Such rapid growth would pose a terrible threat to anyone.</p>

  <p>When the centipede stared at Luo Zheng, the rings on his body began to crack!</p>

  <p>His cultivation method relied on his extremely powerful belief.</p>

  <p>The stronger his confidence was in himself, the stronger the protection power of the rings would be!</p>

  <p>With the help of this token, the centipede, like Luo Zheng, had also crossed the first six layers in an instant and entered directly into the seventh layer for cultivation. His speed was clearly far beyond the others.</p>

  <p>This gave him massive confidence, making him feel as though he was the most talented there was. Thus, the power of his rings was greatly increased.</p>

  <p>Soon, after his tribulation skeleton grew stronger, he would be able to enter the seventeenth layer!</p>

  <p>If he then passed another three layers, he would be able to obtain the Myriad Tribulations Body. Imagining how powerful he would become once he fused with his tribulation skeleton excited him a whole lot.</p>

  <p>The centipede was silent not because this was his personality, but because he felt that he was special and decided not to communicate with the others.</p>

  <p>It was true the others that entered the Land of Bone Tribulation were also outstanding in their respective races, but he was still above them.</p>

  <p>Now however, Luo Zheng had brutally shattered his stable and confident state of mind.</p>

  <p>It was his first time in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and yet here he was, on the same layer as he was!</p>

  <p>Such a talent was unheard of!</p>

  <p>The centipede cried out in his heart continuously.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he tried to deny this, even closing his eyes again and again in the hope it wasn't real, Luo Zheng was still sitting steadily beside him.</p>

  <p>The undeniable fact that he was not the greatest ever began to discourage the centipede. His cultivation method had its flaw and cracks began appearing on the rings.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his token was no longer able to help him resist the small water drops of the sixteenth layer, he had no choice but to retreat back ten feet and enter the fifteenth layer.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>But even the water drops of the fifteenth layer still tore his rings and forced him to continue his retreat.</p>

  <p>On the fourteenth layer, he retreated again...</p>

  <p>On the thirteenth layer, he retreated again...</p>

  <p>On the twelfth layer, he retreated again...</p>

  <p>He finally stopped on the eleventh layer, only ten feet away from the Sturdy Bull.</p>

  <p>The centipede's downfall attracted the whispers of the other creatures.</p>

  <p>They had cultivated together for so long and knew what kind of token they each used.</p>

  <p>They also knew that the centipede's body protection token was connected to his state of mind. It seemed that Luo Zheng's performance had dealt a heavy blow to the centipede.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng didn't know he had unwittingly made the centipede retreat again and again.</p>

  <p>After maintaining balance, Luo Zheng also calmed down and sat upright on the bone plate to be baptized by small drops of water.</p>

  <p>One day passed.</p>

  <p>Two days passed.</p>

  <p>Three days passed...</p>

  <p>In the Myriad Tribulations Storm, all that could be heard was the patter of the small drops of water that smashed onto everyone's body.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, when the Other Shore creatures couldn't bear it, they would retreat ten feet. If they felt that their condition had improved, they would advance back ten feet.</p>

  <p>When the centipede was on the eleventh layer, he did a lot of self-reflection and after calming down, he advanced twenty feet and entered the thirteenth layer once more.</p>

  <p>Ten days passed...</p>

  <p>Twenty days passed...</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits in Luo Zheng's body had experienced an unprecedented torture.</p>

  <p>At the same time being repaired by the Truth of Divine Dao, the Chaotic Source Spirits didn't take a break...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had often performed this kind of oppression after he came out of the Chaotic Source World. It was thanks to this method he was able to step into the later stage of the Chaotic Source Realm in such a short period of time!</p>

  <p>However, after staying in the Myriad Tribulations Storm for twenty-eight days, his Chaotic Source Spirits finally encountered some issues.</p>

  <p>They had integrated into his body and suddenly disappeared and changed into another form. This process caused them to no longer absorb energy for him!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>When the tiny water drops struck the surface of his body, it immediately caused a terribly intense pain!</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>The pain had shocked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to protect his head with both hands and drive the bone plate to retreat.</p>

  <p>His body had originally been as sturdy as a weapon. Moreover, in the past nearly a month, the tribulation skeleton had been greatly enhanced to protect him.</p>

  <p>If not for this, the moment the Chaotic Source Spirits disappeared, the black cracks that the small water drops created would have torn him to pieces!</p>

  <p>After retreating to the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, Luo Zheng stopped.</p>

  <p>The surface of his body looked horrible and was covered in wounds caused by the black cracks that burst out.</p>
