<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 453 Blood Burning (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianming's brave and bold words, all the disciples took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>None of them had ever thought that Tianming could be so ambitious.</p>

  <p>Everyone had dreams. Warriors from humble backgrounds wished to reach high levels so as to help their family's survival and to seek better social status for themselves. Business minded folks wanted to make vast amounts of fortune in this world.</p>

  <p>However, warriors from the noble clans dreamed bigger. They had to fight their way out among their brothers and sisters, contending for the position of the head of the whole family. Then, they would make great efforts and spend vast amounts of time in leading their family to a place where it could stand out among all the other clans and families.</p>

  <p>However, none of them had ever dared to compete with families from other regions.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was much bigger than the Eastern Region. The top seven noble clans could ride roughshod in the Eastern Region but they would be a completely fool if they ever dared to do that in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Tianming was either remarkably brave, or foolishly bold. He thought that he could beat those families from the Central Region and from the other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>The world was vast in size. Most of it hadn't even been explored yet.</p>

  <p>He was more like a beggar from a small town in his efforts; a person who had no idea of how big his country was. However, all of a sudden, he had announced that he would be the king one day.</p>

  <p>This sounded laughable. But, even an emperor, before founding the Burning Sky Empire, was born a beggar before he had finally become a ruler.</p>

  <p>Anybody with such an ambitious plan was better than most of the disciples from the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>"Meeting you before I leave the Eastern Region is such a surprise to me.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, do you know that? You, with just two steps into the nature level, used some basic sword techniques and beat my Four-in-One sword. I practice the Heavenly Sword and that allows me to strike a sympathetic chord with the heavens. I think our meeting is a gift from the God.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you're a test to me. If that is the case, then I simply have to defeat you and move further, because I can't defy the wish of God."</p>

  <p>The blood on Tianming's Blood-corroding Sword seemed to come alive and vibrated slowly on the blade itself. A few seconds later, a seed appeared between his eyebrows. He raised his sword slowly and calmly told him, "I have prepared this for Patrick. But now I have to use it to defeat you."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the seed ruptured.</p>

  <p>With a crack, blue light shot from inside Tianming's eyes, and his temperament changed fundamentally.</p>

  <p>"My precious sword, I'm appealing on behalf of the heavens. Help me and drive the endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth."</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>With the spell that Tianming had just used, the weather suddenly became more violent and fought itself restlessly.</p>

  <p>"The wind rises!" Patrick remarked, eyes still closed.</p>

  <p>Sitting outside the fighting pit, he could even feel the currents moving around him, which was the abnormal phenomenon Tianming had caused and now, those currents seemed to be in his command.</p>

  <p>The wind got stronger as the vitality from the skies and the earth accumulated into one more and more quickly.</p>

  <p>The sword technique used by Tianming in the last round was called Four-in-One Sword, which had gathered the power from the sky to strike Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It had looked like the sky itself was falling towards Luo Zheng, trying to crush and kill him.</p>

  <p>However, this time it was different. Tianming had collected the sky's strength and was holding it in his sword.</p>

  <p>A few moments later the wind stopped and Tianming stood there with his sword in his hand. The currents of a violent storm were now trapped inside his sword, begging to be released. At this very moment, he was extremely normal, except for his blue eyes.</p>

  <p>He seemed like a regular sword man, standing there quietly.</p>

  <p>However, this seeming silence was a great threat to Luo Zheng. He clearly knew that the strength behind his abnormal calmness was much more terrifying than his Four-in-One Sword had been.</p>

  <p>That did not mean that Luo Zheng was afraid. At this moment, he found that his blood was racing around in his veins and his heartbeat was accelerating more and more quickly. He was getting extremely excited.</p>

  <p>'I come from a humble family. Before joining the Cloud Sect, my biggest dream was seeing my sister one more time, though it hasn't been achieved yet. But my dedication to the practice of martial arts is no less than you, Tianming. I also really want to climb up to the top of the mountain and see the big world.'</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Zheng's eyes suddenly became as red as burning fire.</p>

  <p>He wielded his sword, and the sword intents which were now being released, looked like lotus flowers in full bloom. The demonic life vitality he had hidden, was mixed with starlight and flowing on his sword.</p>

  <p>Both of them gathered their strength for a long time before their swords finally clanged one more time. One more furious move about to decide the outcome of this battle.</p>

  <p>However, only normal impacts were produced and limited power was released.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the fencing in the last round had been much more terrifying and stunning. To be very frank, even the training of the disciples usually looked more stunning than this round of sword fight.</p>

  <p>Two sword shadows met for a moment and then they separated. Not even a sound was made.</p>

  <p>"What's happening? Much cry and little done? I thought the whole world would be turned upside down once again. Such a disappointment!"</p>

  <p>"Is it over? Is it done? Who won? Is the referee saying anything?"</p>

  <p>"What's he trying to do? Trick us? It's gonna be a total disappointment. I have been waiting for this for such a long time. I just can't believe that the game is over in such a simple and ordinary way."</p>

  <p>The sudden end of the competition gave rise to much discussion among the audience. None of them knew what had happened.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the saints of the Sect and even Patrick kept their eyes open, as they stared at the fighting pit, surprised and shocked.</p>

  <p>Tracy, hiding in a corner, had to cover her mouth to prevent herself from screaming out, because she seemed to have figured something out. She also looked horrified.</p>
