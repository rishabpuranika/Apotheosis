</p>

  <p>Before they could fathom what was going on, Marco had come dangerously close to the stone of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was maneuvering the boulder with finesse. However, when the gaze of the onlookers fell on Marco charging fiercely at them, they doubted Luo Zheng would be able to dodge such an attack.</p>

  <p>They expected Luo Zheng to be out of the competition once Marco's stone made contact with theirs, judging by his aggression and the height Luo Zheng was at with his boulder.</p>

  <p>Additionally, only seven disciples remained on the Heart Flow Sect's stone. Their combined strength was already insufficient to pull it up, not to mention they had to bear the attack of an approaching stone.</p>

  <p>However, under the watchful gazes of the exceedingly anxious spectators, the giant boulder of the Heart Flow Sect suddenly changed its course.</p>

  <p>The flexibility with which it maneuvered its way away from Marco's attack was far beyond anyone's conjecture.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Swiftly, Luo Zheng had controlled his giant stone to ascend above Marco's boulder.</p>

  <p>It rolled over as it escaped from harm's way.</p>

  <p>The two stones grazed against each other, and the shrieking noise caused by the friction reverberated in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Since he planned on going above Marco, it was evident Luo Zheng didn't intend on just evading, he wanted to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Now that Marco's boulder was underneath Luo Zheng's, it was the perfect opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Now! Go down!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pointed towards Marco's stone and yelled to command the giant boulder. He focused his energy and unleashed the Strength God Totem once more.</p>

  <p>As the Other Shore Power erupted below his feet, Luo Zheng's stone crashed down on to Marco's like a comet freefalling from space.</p>

  <p>Already on the verge of falling from attempting to attack Luo Zheng, Marco's boulder accelerated further down after Luo Zheng's action to tackle him head-on!</p>

  <p>Before his giant stone could touch the ground and eliminate him from the competition, Marco turned to one of his companions and shouted, "Jabril!</p>

  <p>Speed up!"</p>

  <p>The giant boulder of the Vastness Mountain suddenly rushed away from Luo Zheng's crushing stone and shot up with a strong force. In their attempt to escape the fierce attack, four disciples of the Vastness Mountain fell off their positions and were eliminated.</p>

  <p>So close to being out of the competition made Marco break out in a cold sweat as he composed himself.</p>

  <p>"Awesome move, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy clapped her hands subconsciously after witnessing the fierce battle of the two from afar.</p>

  <p>Like everyone else, Dorothy was sure Luo Zheng was screwed when Marco was preparing to launch his attack. She felt proud as he maneuvered himself out of it and turned the tables the other way around.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy..."</p>

  <p>Jermain feebly reminded her to stay focused as he operated the giant stone of Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>After all, Dorothy was the direct descendant of Origin Mountain, and Luo Zheng was her opponent in this competition. Her concern for him would affect the morale and performance of their mountain.</p>

  <p>'Unbelievable, Luo Zheng is as agile as Milo was three years ago, ' Konnor thought to himself as he watched the air battle with his mouth agape.</p>

  <p>His gaze followed Luo Zheng's movements like daggers. The eyes that reflected darkness a while ago now shone bright with hope.</p>

  <p>He had tried to push the stone back as an act of desperation. Never would he have thought Luo Zheng could maneuver his way out of that mess. He applauded Luo Zheng's quick thinking in his head.</p>

  <p>Now, he regretted not putting his faith in Luo Zheng. If he had realized his abilities before, he would have let him operate the boulder from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the top of the mountain, there lay a hollow opening where Qiu Yinhe sat leisurely watching the entire competition while sipping his tea.</p>

  <p>As he brought the cup to his lips to take a sip, a satisfying smile etched across his face. "As I expected, Luo Zheng wouldn't let anyone down."</p>

  <p>"Even though he got lucky in evading Marco's attempted smash, he won't be able to win against him. There are only seven people left on the Heart Flow Sect's stone, and it's not enough to control the giant stone. Last year, when Milo led the Heart Flow Sect to get the top ranking, he had fifteen people on the giant stone who were assisting him," Goran said while peering over and rubbing his chin with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Goran had spectated last year's Seven Mountains Meeting. Milo's memorable performance was still fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>In terms of his understanding of the Truth of Divine Dao, Luo Zheng was at the same level as Milo. However, he was not the only disciple that was capable of Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>As time went on, the battle between the two mountains heated up.</p>

  <p>Bright Mountain was the first to get kicked out of the game. Then Feng Ge successfully smashed into Golden Mountain's boulder, and watched them hit the ground.</p>

  <p>Although other sword sects were still in the game, many people still fell off due to the collisions between their stones with the others.</p>

  <p>When the sword sects began to make their way towards the first weight rune, the competition became more fierce. There were constant violent collisions near the metal mountain, and from time to time, someone would be thrown off the giant stones.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Feng Ge was successful in obtaining the weight rune on the first layer with an absolute suppressive force. Followed closely behind by Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Upon possessing the weight rune, the pressure of the giant stone under their feet suddenly doubled. Adjusting to their new situation, they had to lift the boulder up by inserting in more effort. Moreover, the giant stone now flew more slowly than before.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the first weight rune, the disciples of each mountain had to make their way to the second layer of the metal mountain. Once they reached there and successfully got the second weight rune, they could advance to the top. It so happened that the second layer was much closer to the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Neither Feng Ge nor Jermain would let either side take the lead, and they would go head to head on the second layer to stop one another from reaching the top rank.</p>

  <p>Although Marco was almost eliminated, he got back to the previous state after dissolving the crisis and followed closely behind Luo Zheng for another chance to throw him off.</p>

  <p>In an attempt to ditch Marco, Luo Zheng changed his course of direction and circled the stone wall of the cave. But Marco showed no hints of letting up.</p>

  <p>He persistently followed him at every turn he took.</p>

  <p>"Gain some speed and get rid of that guy," Luo Zheng ordered Mekhi while glancing back at Marco, who was still in pursuit.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's command, Mekhi got in position and released the Truth of Divine Dao once more.</p>

  <p>The stone quickly accelerated to lose Marco, but they were taken by surprise when Killing Sword Sect's and Unique Array Sect's giant boulders appeared right in front of them.</p>

  <p>These two sects worked together from the very beginning. They had secretly reached an agreement that if any of them managed to win, they would split the prize in half among themselves.</p>

  <p>They didn't dare go near Feng Ge or the Origin Mountain because they knew they were no match for them and would be instantly thrown off. Therefore, they worked together to get rid of the other sword sects.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that the Heart Flow Sect has made it this far!" one of the disciples of the Killing Sword Sect hissed and made a mocking gesture.</p>

  <p>Before they could process their next move, the two giant stones rushed towards Luo Zheng's boulder a second time.</p>

  <p>The old situation had repeated itself.</p>

  <p>The Heart Flow Sect was sandwiched between Marco approaching them from behind and the two sword sects attacking from the front. They were cornered.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now, Luo Zheng?" a helpless Mekhi called out to Luo Zheng anxiously.</p>

  <p>Konnor wasn't with them to guide them on what to do next, and they were about to be squished between three giant stones coming from all sides.</p>

  <p>Mekhi's knees began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Judging the circumstances, Luo Zheng gestured Mekhi to move with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Mekhi, get out of the way. Let me deal with this!"</p>

  <p>All the elite disciples respected Konnor and trusted him to keep them out of harm's way. Since he left, they all relied on Luo Zheng with the same amount of faith. Upon hearing Luo Zheng's orders, Mekhi nodded and obediently moved away.</p>

  <p>Swiftly, Luo Zheng placed one foot on the controlling rune and the other on the speed-up rune.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for him to turn the tables around by evading three attacks simultaneously at once alone.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng remembered the time when Konnor had mentioned the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent would help him a lot during this competition.</p>

  <p>The higher level of understanding of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the easier it would get to control a giant stone. That was why the enchanted barrier of Vastness Mountain was thicker than that of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>Jax from the Heart Flow Sect was weak when it came to the understanding of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, which affected the strength of their enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was a much stronger warrior than Jax. He had the capability of Instant Enlightenment. Thus, he faced no trouble operating the controlling rune. It explained how their stone was much more flexible in terms of maneuvering compared to the others.</p>

  <p>Since the three runes on the boulder were similar to the Imperial Sword Seal, was it possible for them to absorb the latter part of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?</p>

  <p>After all, those two Sanskrit words were linked to the previous ones. Luo Zheng had grasped more than a hundred words of the translation, but since he couldn't control the white energy cyclone, he had never tried to understand the rest using the Imperial Sword Seal.</p>

  <p>Once he had processed all the possibilities in his mind, it was time to execute them. He began to unleash the truth aura again while reciting the follow-up of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>In response to his recitation, the cyclone made out of white energy spiraled violently in his mind again.</p>
