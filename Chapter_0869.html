<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 869 Adoration </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two war sages charged toward the door of the Tower of Sin at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Even though the door of the tower wasn't opened yet, the two war sages had already pushed the forceful energy in their bodies to the limit. Just what sort of impact was there going to be?</p>

  <p>They were going fast enough to form a big hole in the wall of the tower, let alone the door.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>As expected, the door of the tower was instantly smashed into pieces and the two war sages charged into the first floor.</p>

  <p>Aside from those on the tenth floor and above, the war fighters and generals below were completely unaware of what was happening.</p>

  <p>On the first floor of the tower, a fierce battle was currently taking place.</p>

  <p>A war fighter from the Night Group was battling with a war fighter from the Giant.</p>

  <p>The war fighter of the Night Group was skilled at assassination in concealment, so his movements were extremely agile. He circled around his opponent, waiting for an opportunity to strike a deadly blow.</p>

  <p>However, the war fighter from the Giant brandished a black iron rod, protecting himself thoroughly without leaving any room for his opponent to attack him.</p>

  <p>As the two war fighters sized each other up, everyone watching them suddenly heard a heaven-shaking sound coming from the door. They turned and saw two ogres standing in the hall on the first floor of the tower.</p>

  <p>Fear appeared in the eyes of all the creatures as they stared at the ogres.</p>

  <p>"How strong are these two ogres? Why can't I see through them?"</p>

  <p>"They seem to be ogre war lords."</p>

  <p>"No. Two years ago, I met a top-level ogre war lord, but he didn't give me this much pressure. These two ogres are probably war sages."</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! How can war sages enter the Cursed Land? As soon as they step into the Cursed Land, they will be killed by the curse!"</p>

  <p>The war fighters on the first floor discussed seriously among themselves as they looked at the two ogre war sages.</p>

  <p>Neil and Colin had exhausted too much forceful energy just now. They were war sages, and their bodies had been stimulated by body refining techniques and were incomparably strong, but they were panting heavily now.</p>

  <p>"So, so close?" Neil heaved.</p>

  <p>"The Cursed Land isn't as powerful as we thought." Colin turned to look at Neil, and a mixture of shock and fear appeared on his face. Pointing at Neil, he stammered, "You, you?"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" There was a puzzled expression on Neil's face, but it soon turned into terror.</p>

  <p>Large black spots began appearing on their faces. Some of the spots split open and black pus flowed out.</p>

  <p>The curse was finally beginning to show its power.</p>

  <p>The bodies of the two war sages suddenly began to collapse. Their skin, flesh, and their bones festered.</p>

  <p>Their bodies, which had originally been like small mountains, were now like melting snowmen. Neil and Colin howled in pain as their bodies disintegrated.</p>

  <p>In the end, they turned into a puddle of tainted blood on the ground.</p>

  <p>The scene gave the ogre war fighters on the first floor a fright.</p>

  <p>"What... What is going on?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? You were right. These two ogres weren't top-level war lords. They must have been war sages at least. That was why they were killed by the curse!"</p>

  <p>"But it's strange. How did the two of them get past the Cursed Land and enter the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>Even if the two ogre war sages had come through the transmission array, they would have still had to cover quite a distance from the transmission array to the Tower of Sin. The Cursed Land was not small by any means.</p>

  <p>They should have been cursed to death as soon as they entered the Cursed Land. But why didn't they die until now?</p>

  <p>Many of the war fighters couldn't understand it either.</p>

  <p>At this moment, on the tenth floor of the tower, the hole in the wall began to wiggle and quickly clamped close like a monster's mouth.</p>

  <p>There was silence on the floor and all the creatures had an incredulous expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Esther shot a meaningful glance to the side. A war general of the Demon Night floated out like the wind, heading toward the ninth floor of the Tower of Sin. It was obvious that he was going to the other floors to gather information.</p>

  <p>Maurice ordered a junior member to climb to the first floor of the tower as well.</p>

  <p>But of all the creatures present, the top-level ogre war lords were the most nervous.</p>

  <p>Maurice knew very well that Colin and Neil weren't truly immune to the curse of the Cursed Land. The truth was that the ogres had thought of a way to keep the war sages in the tower.</p>

  <p>The tower itself could counteract a portion of the curse's killing ability in the Cursed Land. Once, after an ogre top-level war lord became a war sage, he lived for a month in the tower before being killed by the curse.</p>

  <p>In theory, if there was a transmission array in the Tower of Sin, the war sages and the Soul Sea Realm warriors of various great races would be able to temporarily stay in the tower. As long as they could leave through the transmission array within a month, they would be able to safely return to their respective sacred places.</p>

  <p>But because of the tower's special characteristics, it was impossible to draw a transmission array inside. Other than living beings, the tower would devour almost anything inside it, including weapons and corpses. Whatever was left in the tower for a period of time would be absorbed by the tower.</p>

  <p>Some races had thought of ways to set up transmission arrays in the tower, but the arrays could only be set up halfway before being devoured by the tower.</p>

  <p>Therefore, using a transmission array to deliver war sages and Soul Sea Realm warriors wouldn't work.</p>

  <p>However, ten years ago, the ogres had come up with another idea.</p>

  <p>During the month when the Dark Nether Death Light in the Dark Nether Cave was greatly weakened, the seat owners at the top of the tower had led their respective clansmen into the cave to explore.</p>

  <p>At that time, Neil and Colin had been two of over twenty ogre seat owners.</p>

  <p>After a month of exploration, regardless of whether they had obtained the right opportunity or not, all creatures had to return to the Tower of Sin. If they didn't return by then, they could never return.</p>

  <p>The power of the Dark Nether Death Light was not something a war lord could withstand.</p>

  <p>But at that time, Neil and Colin had unexpectedly discovered a secret passage at the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>The secret passage was small and could only accommodate two people.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it just happened to be able to avoid the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>Colin and Neil had hidden in this secret passage to cultivate instead of returning to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Even among the ogres, only the top ten top-level war lords and a few of the higher-ups of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place knew about the two trump cards.</p>

  <p>Today, since an irreconcilable conflict had occurred between the ogres and the Demon Night, the ogres had decided that it was time for them to use their trump cards.</p>

  <p>They had thought that once the two war sages appeared, Esther and the other top-level war lords of the Demon Night would be too weak to face them, giving the ogres an overwhelming advantage.</p>

  <p>Never had they imagined that Luo Luo Zheng would use some strange method to expel the two war sages from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, this scene would become a nightmare that would be repeatedly played in the minds of the top-level ogre war lords.</p>

  <p>As for Fabian and Jarrod, the two top-level war lords of the human race, they had extremely excited expressions on their faces now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was revealing his cards one by one, shocking them time and again.</p>

  <p>Every time they saw Luo Luo Zheng pull a mind blowing stunt, it would take them some time and effort to finally manage to accept it, but Luo Luo Zheng would follow it up with an even bigger miracle.</p>

  <p id="top_10"><a id="p4471" class="calibre2"></a>In fact, many people, including Fabian, Jarrod, Olivia, and Dylon, had been shocked by Luo Luo Zheng so many times that they almost felt numb now.</p>

  <p>Even if someone were to come and tell them that Luo Luo Zheng was the savior sent by the heavens to save them, they would accept it numbly because they no longer knew what to think.</p>

  <p>No one had imagined that the ogres would send two war sages, but Luo Luo Zheng had defeated them as easily as falling off a log. Who else but him could be the savior?</p>

  <p>In a corner of the arena, Olivia's eyes were filled with tears. Luo Luo Zheng had become the only man in her heart. He was perfect!</p>

  <p>She had already loved Luo Luo Zheng, but now, the affection in her heart had been replaced by adoration.</p>

  <p>Before long, the people that Esther and Maurice had sent to the upper floors to collect information returned.</p>

  <p>After they reported what had happened through their life vitality, Esther's face revealed a faint smile. As for Maurice, his face was filled with dejection.</p>

  <p>Although the two of them didn't announce the fate of the ogre war sages out loud, their expressions clearly showed everything.</p>
