<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 812 The Ogre War Lord (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng remembered clearly that his speed had exploded right after the forceful energy had shot out a beam of milky white light. So it must have something to do with that milky white light. But what was that?</p>

  <p>A deep crater had appeared after Luo Zheng had collided with the hill. He stood to his feet and slowly crawled out of the crater. At that moment, the red dragon in Zheng's mind suddenly asked, "Ha-ha, oh boy! Feel strange?"</p>

  <p>"You know what happened?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A portion of the forceful energy that burst out from your body just now is from the Hundred Meetings Platform," The red dragon replied.</p>

  <p>"Does the Hundred Meetings Platform usually have such an effect?" Luo Zheng asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"The real function of the Hundred Meetings Platform is not to boost speed.</p>

  <p>It's the function of the Wind Gate Platform, which is one of the Eight Path Platforms," the red dragon explained, "But your Hundred Meetings Platform is made from the bones of the Cloud-chasing Lion. The Cloud-chasing Lion is considered one of the fastest legendary beasts, and its speed is only inferior to that of the Celestial Mouse. So you have benefited from the Cloud-chasing Lion's talent too."</p>

  <p>"Really? I never thought that things could work this way." Luo Zheng was both surprised and pleased to know this.</p>

  <p>To be honest, compared to the life vitality system, there was a great disadvantage in utilizing the body refining system. Although a warrior could, in theory, transform the forceful energy into an entity, but because of its slow circulation speed and due to the fact that it was evenly distributed throughout the whole body, to transform it into an entity was extremely difficult to realize. Even if one did succeed in doing that, it was known to be extremely impractical.</p>

  <p>In comparison, life vitality was much stronger and flexible in its usage. It was also easier to visualize. To top that all, it could almost produce endless power.</p>

  <p>But the body refining system also had its own unique advantage, and that was the Eight Path Platforms.</p>

  <p>The Eight Path Platforms needed to be constructed by bones. The stronger the bones that were used to build the Path Platforms, the greater would be the benefit of the construction to the cultivator. This was because for the body refiners, the Eight Path Platforms were equivalent to eight chances they had to strengthen themselves. Every time a cultivator completed one Path Platform, they would inherit the talent or strength of the bones' original owner.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, some body refiners who had already reached the late stage of the body refining technique felt that the Path Platforms they had built were not powerful enough, so they would often try to reconstruct the Path Platforms in order to inherit greater talent and power!</p>

  <p>When Zheng's Hundred Meetings Platform was unlocked, he was using the bones of the Cloud-chasing Lion. When Luo Zheng had utilized the forceful energy that had flowed through the Hundred Meetings Platform, the Cloud-chasing Lion's talent had exhibited itself on Zheng's body. So in the instant when it had increased his speed, even Luo Zheng himself was completely caught off guard.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there were still dozens of ogres floating around in the sky.</p>

  <p>From the lesson they had just paid for with blood, they realized that they could not contain this enemy. When they saw Luo Zheng slowly fly back, these ogres all scattered away.</p>

  <p>It was known to all that ogres loved to fight. However, when the humans in the forest saw this scene, they were left speechless in bewilderment. When had they ever seen the ogres be so cowardly? The ogres were the sort of creatures that fought like they didn't even care about their own lives.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in a war between ogres and humans, even if it were humans who had the advantage, they would often lose in the end because they weren't willing to die.</p>

  <p>Ogres were slow in their reactions, but they were not halfwits. It was clear as day to them that they were no match for Luo Zheng. They would not go and die under Zheng's sword with the knowledge that they didn't stand a chance to win.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng was flying back to where he had been, a powerful voice rang out. "Human kid, you have to stay!"</p>

  <p>"Here comes another ogre..." Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes as he saw an ogre floating in the sky and flying towards him at a calm and unhurried pace.</p>

  <p>The ogre's skin was red, and the two fangs protruding from the corner of his mouth were a blood-shade of scarlet. "An interesting human brat! A puny war fighter, but you actually killed my ogre war generals in succession. I wonder if you can kill me, an ogre war lord."</p>

  <p>"This ogre is very powerful!" Zheng's face fell as he saw the ogre. An ogre war lord's strength was equivalent to that of a human who was a Virtual Tribulation Realm master. At his current level of strength, he would be unable to stand up against such an enemy alone.</p>

  <p>There was a chance for him to escape, but the problem was that he had a group of ordinary humans following him. Luo Zheng could, of course, choose to leave them behind, since the lives of these common and ordinary people were not worth mentioning in a world full of powerful warriors. However, Luo Zheng was not the sort of person who gave up halfway.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could say anything, the ogre war lord had already landed and was rapidly charging towards him, his figure as big as a hill.</p>

  <p>As the ogre war lord raced forward and drew closer, Luo Zheng watched him get bigger in his eyes. A sense of extreme danger weighed down on him. He suddenly felt his heart tighten. This ogre war lord possessed the strength to kill him and was going to do so too!</p>

  <p>In his moment of despair, Luo Zheng summoned the sword spirit he had condensed� Lily. In a flash, a beautiful girl popped out from thin air, together with the huge sword that had originally belonged to the Blood Fiend Emperor.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Demon Night, who were observing the scene from afar, were suddenly left aghast. One of them was a young lady who was sitting on top of a tree. At the sight of Zheng's sword spirit, her eyes became wide as saucers and her mouth was left hanging open in surprise.</p>
