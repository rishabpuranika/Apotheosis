<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4302 Infinity And Everything </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I had been in the perfect land for such a long time. I thought I could control everything, so I released Mastema.</p>

  <p>Then, I started cultivating him bit by bit. I was glad to see him become much stronger.</p>

  <p>Especially when we were in the Boundless Shock World, I was deeply elated when I saw the range of destruction that he made. At the same time, I also despised the perfect land. Perfection means that it's already done, and there is nothing else to change. That's why I liked the imperfection of the Boundless Shock World more.</p>

  <p>Mastema brought death, but he also brought forth creation and rebirth.</p>

  <p>However, he went out of control. That was my biggest mistake and failure."</p>

  <p>Clarence's voice became too dispirited.</p>

  <p>His confidence was crushed by repeated failures.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng wasn't able to respond right away.</p>

  <p>He had never thought that Clarence would actually have a depressing personality.</p>

  <p>"But, isn't there still a chance?" Luo Zheng finally asked.</p>

  <p>"Chance? What do you mean?" Clarence replied.</p>

  <p>"You have awakened. With your absolute infinite energy and the ancestry-level bloodline, don't we have a chance to defeat him?" Luo Zheng answered with positivity.</p>

  <p>"Forget it?" Clarence said with a bitter smile. "I have already defeated him many times. It's still no use. I still wasn't able to stop him from downgrading the worlds," he continued.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's better than doing nothing!" Luo Zheng retorted, not showing any hint of willingness to give up.</p>

  <p>When he first heard of Clarence's name, he had several guesses and high expectations for him. Thus, he was disappointed and frustrated that this person wasn't what he thought he would be.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Clarence could actually read all of Luo Zheng's thoughts and memories. He could even feel his emotions, but he still didn't care.</p>

  <p>The downgrader always treated the creatures born outside of the perfect land as tools, while Clarence saw them as a process.</p>

  <p>This included the human beings, the four spirits, the Fostering race, the Cinnabar race, and the Sacred Spirit race.</p>

  <p>He saw their existence as a process, and now, that process would finally come to an end. All the positive and negative things that occurred within the process were actually insignificant. Everything would still end at the appointed time.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you still want to resist, I can help you. You're already skillful in using the Extreme Form energies, right? The only difference between you and the downgrader is the amount of energy, but I can also give you what he already has," Clarence said unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"Really? You'd do that?" Luo Zheng's eyes instantly lit up as he heard this.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's not that difficult for me," Clarence replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Well, then?" Luo Zheng took a deep breath and sincerely said, "Please entrust it to me!"</p>

  <p>Clarence didn't say anything but just directly infused some memories into Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly and silently read these memories as he received them. After he finished, he suddenly understood why there was such a huge gap between him and the downgrader.</p>

  <p>If the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline was likened to a line on a plane, then countless points could be acquired out of this line. This would be deemed as an infinite amount of energy.</p>

  <p>However, what the downgader possessed were all the points in the plane.</p>

  <p>It was a different kind of infinity that would surely overwhelm even the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>With this, Clarence had already bestowed Luo Zheng everything he needed.</p>

  <p>"Now, you know what you are about to face.</p>

  <p>Let me see your resolve. I want to witness what this infinite strength could change."</p>

  <p>Clarence had somehow become excited that his voice was even trembling.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Come out!</p>

  <p>You can't just hide for the rest of your life!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader knew that he had many ways to kill Luo Zheng. However, he still needed to completely destroy the Burial Land before he dealt with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In order to downgrade the worlds, he needed the primitive land. He didn't want to create a new one, which was why he hadn't destroyed the Burial Land just yet.</p>

  <p>For a while, he had been shouting in the whole Burial Land, but Luo Zheng was still nowhere to be found and wasn't making any move.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the downgrader looked towards the center of the Burial Land, where many tiny creatures were currently gathered.</p>

  <p>"Ha! The Troubled Creatures have arrived. If you still plan on hiding, the remaining creatures in your primitive land will all be eaten up!"</p>

  <p>About seventy billion Troubled Creatures shrank into a ball with a diameter of tens of millions of miles, tightly wrapping around the Li Shan mountain, the Ruin Graveyard, and the other places.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ruin Graveyard was actually located at the edge, and the Troubled Creatures had already invaded it.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Those monsters are coming!"</p>

  <p>"We have to run!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Where do you plan on going? Didn't you listen to what Luo Zheng said? We have no choice but to fight against them! There's already no way to escape!"</p>

  <p>The masters in the Ruin Graveyard had already been ready to fight or die.</p>

  <p>Previously, when they had escaped from the heads, they were able to hold on to a glimmer of hope. They thought that perhaps, they could do the same with the Troubled Creatures. These creatures looked dreadful, but if they worked together, they might be able to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>However, when the Troubled Creatures already appeared in the Ruin Graveyard, everyone was utterly dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>These creatures possessed demonic space theurgies. Their bodies flickered, making it very hard for them to capture their movements with just their naked eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ha! You may be fast, but let's see how powerful you are. I'll send you back to the hell you came from!"</p>

  <p>Augustus roared as he rushed towards the Troubled Creatures. He was one of the masters responsible for guarding the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>He released a huge diamond-shaped space, which spun crazily and dashed towards the first Troubled Creature.</p>

  <p>Augustus's Other Shore Token had the space attribute, which was considered outstanding among the Other Shore Tokens possessed by the warriors in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely inferior against the strength of the Troubled Creatures, which possessed the Hyperspace Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Augustus only saw a blur in front of him. The next moment, he was already grabbed by a huge Troubled Creature in one of its hands.</p>

  <p>"These silly humans!</p>

  <p>You're so pathetically weak, yet you still struggle?"</p>

  <p>Right after the Troubled Creature spoke, it stuffed Augustus into its mouth.</p>

  <p>Before he was chewed, Augustus's remaining consciousness had fallen into endless despair, and everything else went hazy.</p>

  <p>'These Troubled Creatures are this powerful? There are tens of billions of them, for crying out loud!</p>

  <p>What an unjust world this is!'</p>

  <p>In his fleeting thoughts, Augustus couldn't do anything but blame his weakness and the unfair world.</p>

  <p>"Augustus!"</p>

  <p>Not far away, Hallet was fast approaching.</p>

  <p>He shook the fishing rod in his hand, and a golden thread swept across towards the Troubled Creature. He was desperately trying to save Augustus by attempting to cut off the Troubled Creature's head using the fishing thread.</p>

  <p>However, just when the golden fishing thread flew out, Hallet suddenly felt that a huge black shadow brushed past him. Then, he noticed that his body became lighter. As he looked down, he saw that the lower part of his body was already cut off. Beside him, he saw a floating Troubled Creature, and the lower part of his body was hanging on its sharp nails.</p>

  <p>"Do you even know how weak you are? Ha-ha! These people have a death wish!" The Troubled Creature licked the blood off its nails as it stared at Hallet.</p>

  <p>"These? These creatures? They're just soldiers, yet they are this powerful."</p>

  <p>Hallet coughed out blood as he looked at the Troubled Creature in disbelief.</p>

  <p>He knew that he wouldn't be able to survive after the damage he suffered.</p>

  <p>He even thought at first that with his strength, he might be able to kill at least a thousand or ten thousand of them. Never did he expect that he couldn't even deal with a single one.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>As Hallet's body was falling to the ground, the Troubled Creature launched another attack.</p>

  <p>Its movements were so fast that Hallet didn't even have any time to react.</p>

  <p>As the Troubled Creature's fist landed on Hallet, his body instantly turned into a blood mist.</p>

  <p>The other warriors at the Other Shore Realm had initially mustered their courage to guard the Ruin Graveyard against the Troubled Creatures and put their lives on the line. However, when they saw what had happened to Augustus and Hallet, they all fled and dispersed in all directions.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, in the face of these vicious creatures, no one could get away from them.</p>

  <p>In an instant, all of them were mercilessly killed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't even a battle. It was just a massacre. Only the Li Shan mountain was able to resist the Troubled Creatures, and it was all because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had used the Hyperspace Extreme Form to create a huge blue ring of light. Whenever a Troubled Creature passed through the blue ring of light, their Hyperspace Extreme Form would be countered.</p>
