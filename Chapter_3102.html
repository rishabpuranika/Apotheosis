<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Raphael was trying to figure out a way out of his dilemma, but there was simply no way he could get his hands on so many divine crystals so quickly.</p>

  <p>When Gant spoke up, Raphael was greatly surprised. He gave his nephew a strange glance. "First, why would you help me? And also, how did you get your hands on that amount of divine crystals?" he asked.</p>

  <p>As far as Raphael knew, Gant's father had refused to provide his son with financial support after they fought over Gant's plans to go to the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Gant looked coldly at his uncle. "Where I got the divine crystals is none of your business. As for why I'll help you, I have just one request. Tell me about Eira," he said bluntly. "And if you don't, I'll leave you to the dubious mercies of these Taiyi Guards."</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards, listening to Gant and Raphael, felt even more disdain for the fraudulent sword-seller. They wondered how such a man could be part of the Su Clan. At any rate, the Su Clan or not, they would make him suffer if he declined his nephew's offer and failed to give them their divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Raphael was hesitant, but he knew he had no other choice. With some reluctance he agreed to Gant's terms.</p>

  <p>He studied Gant with trepidation, wondering if he really had hundreds of thousands of divine crystals on hand.</p>

  <p>Gant turned to Luo Zheng. "Flag Master, please!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng extended his hand, turning up his palm. Light flashed from his space ring. In a moment, a pile of divine crystals appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards collected them, gave Raphael a last mocking sneer, then turned and left them alone.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Taiyi Guards were gone, color returned to Raphael's deathly pale face. What a close call! He shuddered to think what would have happened if Gant hadn't bailed him out.</p>

  <p>Gant had no time for further distractions. He asked, "Well? Where is Eira?</p>

  <p>Is she all right?"</p>

  <p>Raphael sighed and seemed to be deep in thought. "The truth is that she is very weak. She hasn't been able to recover any strength and has been in a coma because too much of her blood has been drained..."</p>

  <p>"How could they do that?" Gant murmured. A vision of Eira's pale, bloodless face came to him, and his own face darkened. His heart ached.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they won't stop until they've squeezed everything they can out of Eira," said Raphael gloomily.</p>

  <p>The weapon refiners of the Su Clan, famous for their skills, were also notorious for being rather cold-blooded in exercising those skills. The refinement of legendary weapons often required a higher price than just effort and diligence. Raphael was one of the exceptions? he did not approve of the lengths to which the Su Clan members would go in order to refine weapons.</p>

  <p>"Can't they take just a few days off?" asked Gant helplessly.</p>

  <p>If they kept draining Eira's blood to refine weapons, her body would wither and she would die.</p>

  <p>She needed time, time to rest and recover. Blood-producing magic pills would help the recovery process too.</p>

  <p>"There's no time to waste. The Jin Wu keeps attacking us. Everyone is desperate for weapons. Not to mention, the Shade Stone can't be moved at all. The Su Clan believes they have no choice but to sacrifice Eira,"</p>

  <p>Raphael said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Gant clenched his jaw. Of course the Su Clan would never consider choosing Eira's life over their own reputation and traditions.</p>

  <p>"Let me talk to my father!" Gant demanded. There was a look of deep resolution in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Talk to your father? Are you crazy? If he found out you were here, he would find a way to prevent you from ever leaving again," Raphael said. He put a hand on Gant's shoulder. "Thank you for your help. And now, I advise you to return to the Dragon City as soon as possible. This is a dangerous place, and your father will not receive you with open arms."</p>

  <p>Gant ignored the advice. "Take me to my father! Otherwise, I will retrieve my three hundred thousand divine crystals from those guards," he threatened.</p>

  <p>Raphael fell silent. He did not actually think Gant could recover the divine crystals from the Taiyi Guards, but he felt impressed by his nephew's determination. He thought Gant was being foolish, and very brave.</p>

  <p>He considered for a moment. Then he said, "Very well. I will take you there, but not to talk to your father, only to visit Eira. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Gant quickly.</p>

  <p>Raphael put away his swords and closed his booth. He began walking into the heart of the city, with Gant and Luo Zheng following behind him.</p>

  <p>As they walked, Gant spoke to Luo Zheng through life vitality. "Flag Master, I appreciate your help. I will repay you for the divine crystals no matter how long it takes."</p>

  <p>He knew that three hundred thousand divine crystals, such a large sum to him and his uncle, was only a small number to Luo Zheng. Nonetheless, he could not take such an amount without vowing to pay it back.</p>

  <p>"It's not a big deal for me. Please forget it," said Luo Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought Gant was among the most hardworking of his subordinates.</p>

  <p>Not to mention, Luo Zheng's Sword-reading Liquid business was doing well and raking in large amounts of money. Three hundred thousand divine crystals was truly an insignificant sum to him, especially in the face of Gant's plight.</p>

  <p>He would give his followers divine crystals if they needed them, Gant included.</p>

  <p>Gant said nothing. He stayed silent for the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>Finally, they reached the wall, which was still patrolled by the Taiyi Guards. The guards moved to block their way.</p>

  <p>However, Raphael showed them a token, and the Taiyi Guards immediately allowed them to pass.</p>

  <p>Just before they entered, Luo Zheng saw the magic array. It was comprised of vibrant red lines, and supposedly able to prevent the Soul-depriving Jin Wu from seizing human bodies.</p>

  <p>As they walked past the wall, Luo Zheng saw several glowing green columns ahead of them.</p>

  <p>A dark, square-shaped stone floated in the center of these columns.</p>

  <p>The stone was suspended in midair, and hung completely still, as though it was placed on top of some invisible structure. There was magic in its aura.</p>

  <p>This must be the Shade Stone that Gant had mentioned to him earlier.</p>

  <p>"After so many years, another Shade Stone has popped up. Haha! But I'm afraid there isn't much time left..." The voice of No. 9527 suddenly rang in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much time left? What do you mean by that?" Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 chose not to answer Luo Zheng's question. "I wonder what kind of Other Shore Token is stored within this Shade Stone..."</p>

  <p>"So you are interested in this?" Luo Zheng asked, feeling deeply curious.</p>

  <p>Over the years, not much had caught the attention of No. 9527, not even the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to remember everything Gant had told him about the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>It could only be refined into the premium Other Shore Treasure that was comparable to a primary Grand Nature Treasure, but Luo Zheng had some doubts about that.</p>

  <p>"My interest has nothing to do with the refinement of weapon. Actually, this is a sign," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>"What kind of sign?" Luo Zheng said, confused.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 sounded reflective. "You can regard it as a timer. Think of it as a grain of sand falling from the sand clock... it is a sign of the degradation of order into chaos."</p>

  <p>"Can you be more specific?" Luo Zheng sounded a bit frustrated.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, then..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed. It wasn't the first time that No. 9527 said something mysterious and indecipherable.</p>

  <p>He walked with Gant and Raphael past the stone, and around the huge Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array. Eventually, they reached a simple building.</p>

  <p>Raphael entered the building first. He emerged a short while later, waving for Luo Zheng and Gant to come closer. "Remember, you must leave as soon as you have seen Eira. If your father finds out about this, all of us will be in big trouble."</p>

  <p>Gant and Luo Zheng quietly slipped inside. Raphael led them to a room with a small blood-red array in one corner. A girl dressed in white lay at the center of the array.</p>

  <p>The young girl was quite pretty. But her lovely face was white as a sheet, and her breathing was slow and shallow. It was obvious that she had already lost too much blood.</p>

  <p>The red array flashed, and more drops of blood oozed out of the young girl's body.</p>

  <p>"Eira!"</p>

  <p>The sight of Eira, so pale and weak, sent a pang of pain through Gant. He rushed forward as though to pull her to safety.</p>

  <p>Raphael seized him by the arm. "Stop it!" he hissed. "Are you insane?"</p>

  <p>Gant was furious. "They are the ones who are insane! Eira is dying, and still they drain her of more blood!" he shouted. He tried to shake his arm free, but Raphael maintained his grip.</p>

  <p>"You know there's nothing I can do! If you want to save her, good luck persuading your father to do so! After all, you don't have the ability to remove her from the array either... or do you?" Raphael asked. He met his nephew's eyes.</p>
