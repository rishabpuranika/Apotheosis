  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng had no plans of backing off. It did not matter whether it was Yates or James that he had to face. It was simply out of the question.</p>

  <p>The reason why he did not back was simple. He was confident in his own strength.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw the sword energy trying to destroy him, he could not help but start to retreat.</p>

  <p>It was not out of fear though. He was simply not a fool or a coward.</p>

  <p>After all, his body, which was a spiritual weapon, possessed a defensive power much stronger than that of an ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the opponent was a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>What he had in his hand was a fairy weapon, and no one would wish to be at the receiving end of the sword energy!</p>

  <p>The sword energy did not have high speed at the beginning. In fact, it had the same pace as ordinary people who aimlessly trotted. However, after it focused on Luo Luo Zheng as the target, its velocity greatly increased all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>The sword energy brought a baby blue shadow in the air, and then it tried to cut Luo Luo Zheng at an incredibly high speed.</p>

  <p>It was rapid, indeed, but Luo Luo Zheng was not slow either.</p>

  <p>Moving backward, he swung a fist at the sword energy.</p>

  <p>A part of him had hoped that the Heavenly Ogre Fist could counteract the power of the sword energy.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he gave it his best shot and unceasingly tried to subdue his opponent's power. Each time he swung his fist, a dark purple fist shadow dashed towards the sword energy.</p>

  <p>With the power of the Phoenix Crystal, he made dozens of fist shadows in an instant.</p>

  <p>To his great surprise, however, the first fist shadow that had struck the sword energy went through it directly. The sword energy was unscathed.</p>

  <p>'It's useless?'</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng realized that his attack did not affect the sword energy, he felt a pang of disappointment. Slowly, the reason dawned on him.</p>

  <p>The sword energy merely emitted from a low-grade fairy weapon with strong power. It was not made from life vitality, so his Heavenly Ogre Fist could do nothing to it.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw that the first fist shadow had failed to counteract the sword energy's power, he reacted quickly and changed his tactic.</p>

  <p>When the second fist shadow reached the sword energy, he decisively ignited the star power in his life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The explosion from the star power created a violent and bright light, releasing an immense force of annihilation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, right after the bright light disappeared, the sword energy showed no sign of weakening and still rushed to slash Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'It's still useless, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As all his methods had been weak against the sword energy so far, he could not help but feel a bit frustrated.</p>

  <p>The master at the Illuminating Soul Realm was too powerful.</p>

  <p>Even if the Mo Clan was only a declining clan, as the master, James still possessed a remarkably powerful strength, which was beyond what Luo Luo Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had fought against someone at the Illuminating Soul Realm twice and did not suffer any loss. This time though, he deeply realized the horrible power of the masters at this realm.</p>

  <p>Due to his astonishment, he thought but quickly forgot about his realm.</p>

  <p>The nature creature and master at the Illuminating Soul Realm had a large gap in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>There was a world of difference.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could force James to show the master card, the Ruin Sword, and it was enough to make every nature creature in the world feel deeply ashamed.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng could resist James' sword this time, then all the nature creatures might commit suicide. After all, Luo Luo Zheng was only at grade 1 of the nature level.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng retreated hastily, he had moved back to the edge of the courtyard. Facing the high wall made of green bricks, he did not have time to think and dashed to the wall with his tough back. In almost a humorous manner, he dashed through the wall and created a human-shaped hole, as if it was jerry-built.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the sword energy trailed after Luo Luo Zheng as if it was his shadow and entered through the hole in the wall. Except that the shadow was taller than Luo Luo Zheng. It had the height of about nine feet, so it cut the wall with a tiny crack.</p>

  <p>All the people stared at the wall with different expressions.</p>

  <p>The people who stood on the Mo Clan's side naturally thought that Luo Luo Zheng was going to kick the bucket, as they did not think that he could avoid the sword energy. How could a nature creature avoid the attack of a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm with all of his strength?</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Luo Zheng had deflected James' attacks with all kinds of weapons successfully. If he could stay alive despite the sword energy chasing after him, that would be incredible.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the disciples of Cloud Sect like Wurth and Nina wore worried expressions. Without a doubt, they hoped that Luo Luo Zheng could escape from death and avoid the sword energy. Regardless, they could not deny thinking that it was impossible.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>The violent clash appeared continuously from the side of the wall. It appeared that Luo Luo Zheng had run through so many walls just to dodge the sword energy.</p>

  <p>At this time, Nina could not stand it anymore. Creasing her beautiful brows lightly, she tried to calm down and then spoke to James,"Master Mo, Luo Luo Zheng is just a junior and has said something unpleasant to hear, but he doesn't deserve to die. Please forgive him."</p>

  <p>At that moment, James still held up the long sword and pointed out the direction of the sword's tip with his fingers. When he was controlling the sword energy to chase Luo Luo Zheng, he saw that it was almost about to kill him, but the man managed to run away because of Nina's interruption.</p>

  <p>However, James was not anxious. If this sword energy could not kill Luo Luo Zheng, James would have wasted so many years cultivating.</p>

  <p>When James heard Nina's words, he smiled casually,"Since he has said something wrong, he needs to pay the price. I am just teaching him a lesson."</p>

  <p>James was unwilling to let the man go. Although he said he was simply teaching Luo Luo Zheng a lesson, how could the man stay alive if the sword energy chopped his body?</p>
