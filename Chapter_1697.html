<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Shania was at the Soul Sea Realm, she was still the reincarnation of the Queen of Life.</p>

  <p>All these years, Ying had remained silent about the chaos of the entire Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Whether it was Yao or Xun, Ying had always pretended that she'd never seen any of their fights. Sometimes, she would even add fuel to the fire.</p>

  <p>None of the previous Queens of Life had stirred up troubles, but Ying was an extremely special case.</p>

  <p>In Ying's eyes, Xun was just a cold but passionate little sister.</p>

  <p>She only knew how to lead the Demon Night race to battle so that they could expand their influence and power; she represented the fighting strength of the Demon Night race. Many Supreme Lords would flee when facing them.</p>

  <p>And Yao was destined to be a schemer with great ambition but short sight. Controlling the Demon Night race seemed to be the greatest pleasure for her.</p>

  <p>But the interests that Ying had were completely different from theirs.</p>

  <p>She had always had an extraordinary commitment to the Life Law as well as an extraordinary sensitivity.</p>

  <p>Giving people life and trying to make them grow and reproduce was the greatest pleasure for her.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was a lot more to the joy of the Life Law. The unique power of the curse that appeared when a life came to an end also piqued her interest.</p>

  <p>Why did the power of the curse gather into a malicious Mu Ning before a life came to an end? Why couldn't a martial artist live forever? Why did the strong fall into the Five Aging Processes?</p>

  <p>Long ago, there had been many questions in young Ying's mind about mysteries that everyone else just took for granted.</p>

  <p>After all, these rules had always existed without any rhyme or reason.</p>

  <p>But this was Ying's character. Once she was curious about something, she wouldn't be able to rest until she found some answers.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of others, becoming the Queen of Life was already the end of Ying's life. The queen of the Demon Night race was comparable to a Supreme Lord, and was considered the highest existence in the entire universe. In many ways, her position of power was even higher than a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>But Ying had known that it was just the beginning for her.</p>

  <p>There were so many things in her mind that she still hadn't unraveled.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because she was at the level of Queen of Life that her comprehension of the Life Law increased day by day, becoming more and more thorough.</p>

  <p>Sixth layer, seventh layer, eighth layer, ninth layer...</p>

  <p>The Law Power could not reach the tenth layer, which was the perfect level.</p>

  <p>Only a Supreme Lord would be able to achieve perfection after bearing a Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>This was a clear demarcation.</p>

  <p>She couldn't break through that boundary.</p>

  <p>It was said that only those who opened 36 lotus petals and possessed a Mahayana Lotus Flower would be able to cross this boundary.</p>

  <p>Then what exactly was the Lotus Flower that floated above one's head when one reached the Life and Death Realm? Why was it right above everyone's heads? Why would everyone's fate be dictated by such a Lotus Flower?</p>

  <p>Instead of her doubts being lessened, Ying found that they were increasing.</p>

  <p>Most people wouldn't think about why a Lotus Flower was necessary in order to become a Godly Genius. They would mindlessly work towards that goal without thinking why such a goal was there in the first place.</p>

  <p>Ying was an exception. She had questions about everything. However, no matter how hard she tried and how much she studied, she could not cross the line that would allow her to obtain some answers.</p>

  <p>She knew that the divine land existed, but to all the living creatures in the universe, the divine land was but an ethereal concept. There were many things that were deliberately hidden.</p>

  <p>There was no such relationship between the Lower World and the Upper World of the universe.</p>

  <p>The Lower World consisted of many great worlds with relatively mild and weak vitality, but the channels that linked the Upper World and the Lower World were not sealed. Thus, it wasn't too rare for martial artists from the Upper World to return to the Lower World.</p>

  <p>However, none of the True Gods that crossed that line had returned.</p>

  <p>They had all gone silent.</p>

  <p>"This is a deliberate restriction,"</p>

  <p>Ying finally concluded.</p>

  <p>Following the Life Law, when a martial artist reached the Soul Sea Realm, their physical bodies would be near perfect. In theory, they would have reached eternal life, but they would fall into the Five Aging Processes within 30, 000 years.</p>

  <p>In Ying's eyes, the Five Aging Processes was a kind of curse, a curse cast by the heavens. It forbade the perpetual existence of living creatures in the universe.</p>

  <p>Each time before a living creature died, a curse would be placed on the killer to add to their malicious Mu Ning. This was to prevent all the creatures in the universe from killing too many people.</p>

  <p>These rules were arranged very deliberately. It was obvious that someone was deliberately restricting them like this.</p>

  <p>What Ying wanted to do was to remove these restrictions, to unbind the laws of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Back then when she was exploring these things, Yao had already made a move against Xun, trying to kill her.</p>

  <p>This was an earth-shattering event for the Demon Night race, but Ying hadn't questioned it. The Supreme Lord behind her had also warned her about Yao's ambitions.</p>

  <p>The three queens should have been mutually controlling and restricting each other.</p>

  <p>If Ying had been willing to step in from the start, perhaps Yao's ambition would not have expanded to such a degree. It was Ying's laissez-faire attitude that had allowed her to become so unscrupulous.</p>

  <p>She was unbothered about worldly events, and she focused her entire attention on exploring the deepest mysteries of the universe.</p>

  <p>But she didn't know that she wasn't the only one doing this.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race and Supreme Lord of Original Sin had more or less explored these areas as well, but in vain. None of them had found any tangible answers.</p>

  <p>Ying had once wondered whether that mysterious young girl was the controller of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she had used the Roaring Token to ask the mysterious girl about this. However, the mysterious girl hadn't responded to her question at all.</p>

  <p>So, Ying had stopped pestering her and chosen to reincarnate before the crisis of the world of chaos came.</p>

  <p>Being reincarnated had cost her all of her cultivation and talent, almost equivalent to a rebirth. Moreover, that wasn't the only price she'd had to pay. She had spent nearly a third of the Pool of Faith's faith to be reincarnated. This Pool of Faith had been accumulated over the endless years by the Demon Night race, so the fact that she would need to consume one-third of it had come as a shock to her race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she had also been strongly opposed by the Supreme Lord at first.</p>

  <p>But everyone had their own goals. Since Ying had insisted on being reincarnated, the Supreme Lord had decided that it would be useless to oppose her.</p>

  <p>In the end, her wish had been granted and she'd entered the Illusion Battlefield. She had even walked through the Hall of Causality and encountered the True Gods she had yearned for.</p>

  <p>But those True Gods, in the end, were just marks.</p>

  <p>They had only discussed the techniques needed to achieve the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>When it came to Ying's questions, the marks of the True Gods had remained silent.</p>

  <p>Ying, who now went by the name 'Shania, ' did not feel discouraged.</p>

  <p>She knew that she would understand more after walking further into the Illusion Battlefield. Since everything had a set of rules, she would follow those rules and then break them.</p>

  <p>As for why she needed the Saint Killing Spear, she wanted to gather all three of the Demon Night race's supreme divine weapons. However, she had her own reasons for that. It was all about an inheritance of the Demon Night race. Originally, the inheritance would be activated when the Demon Night race met a crisis, but Shania intended to ignore this rule.</p>

  <p>This was her personality. Once she was certain of something, she had to accomplish it. Anyone who stood in her way would be crushed by her.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Zheng was extremely uncooperative.</p>

  <p>Hence, after she came up, she released an extremely cruel and profoundly mysterious skill— the Circle of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>A black and white wheel appeared in her hand, but Luo Zheng, who was one step ahead of her, had already begun to retreat rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Life Law gave Luo Zheng an exceedingly strange feeling, and he almost instinctively wanted to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng retreated quickly, but the dual-colored wheel moved with Shania's thought. In theory, it was impossible to avoid it.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng was enveloped by the dual-colored wheel.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Shania's face. At this moment, her eyes turned into two different colors. One of them was black, exuding a strong Mu Ning of death, while the other was light green, full of vitality.</p>

  <p>"Enjoy it," she said. She didn't care about these Godly Geniuses at all.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't possess the strength she'd had before her reincarnation, her comprehension of Laws was still intact. How could these juniors possibly contend with a powerhouse that had once stood on par with the Supreme Lords?</p>
