  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I can obtain this bloodline when they reproduce to the limit?" Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned around and stared at the little boys who pounced on him.</p>

  <p>He finally understood what they meant.</p>

  <p>These little boys couldn't reproduce infinitely. They would reach their limit if he continuously killed them.</p>

  <p>And when they did, then he would be able to obtain the bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Well then, let me try!"</p>

  <p>He violently kicked another boy who pounced on him to the ground. The moment the boy fell, dozens of more boys appeared.</p>

  <p>"It's too slow..."</p>

  <p>He lifted his leg and rushed towards the little boys.</p>

  <p>He was like a shuttle as he flew and left only a long series of shadows behind. He killed nearly a hundred boys in an instant, who all immediately disappeared except for their skins.</p>

  <p>After that, thousands of more boys appeared in the deserted space.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to speed up the slaughter to make the number of the little boys closer to the limit of their reproduction, the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization said, "Pass through the crack and move forward, then you can find the next origin-level bloodline, which is named the 'Ultimate Cycle'."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Zheng stiffened slightly and descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>He trampled dozens of little boys as he went down. "How did you know that?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because I have deciphered the other Sanskrit word," answered the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>There was a Sanskrit word on each side of the crack in the middle of the bronze wall.</p>

  <p>What the Civilization Artifact said just now was the meaning of the other Sanskrit word. "Are you going there to have a look or stay here to merge with this bloodline?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng himself should make the decision about the bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he kicked back, and his body rotated dozens of times in the air before he landed steadily in front of the bronze wall. He looked at the light dots in the crack and said, "I want to go and have a look."</p>

  <p>There were four origin-level bloodlines, which should all be different. Thus, he wanted to understand them first before he merged with any of them.</p>

  <p>However, he still doubted if he could pass through the Abstruse Energy World or not.</p>

  <p>That was because although he had entered the Abstruse Energy World before, his understanding of it was not as good as Geoffrey's. It would be terrible if he couldn't move a single step after entering the passage.</p>

  <p>While he thought and hesitated, a large number of little boys swarmed towards him.</p>

  <p>Since he didn't have much time to think about it carefully, he decided not to think about it anymore and directly went into the crack.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered the crack, he turned into countless light dots and flew far away.</p>

  <p>In that form, he couldn't control most of his own body, nor could he even tell what form he was in.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the whole process didn't last long. He suddenly felt heavy a few seconds later, then he fell.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It turned out that he fell from the sky of the second world.</p>

  <p>Now, the top of the world he was in was also a bronze wall with a downward crack.</p>

  <p>He fell dozens of feet more then he began to float steadily in the air. He looked down and saw the entire world.</p>

  <p>It was a large cave, and a massive bronze mountain floated in the center. A long, strangely shaped snake was drawn on the mountain's surface. The snake circled, and it seemed that it was devouring its tail.</p>

  <p>"What does this painting mean?"</p>

  <p>When he was about to get closer to the mountain to see it better, he felt a powerful force that pressed down on him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He dropped several thousand feet. He felt the scene in front of him flash by, and he was in front of the mountain again.</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>Before he could say anything else, the gravitational force pressed down once more. He plummeted fast and returned to the side of the mountain again, where he saw the snake that ate itself.</p>

  <p>This time, he didn't say anything. He quietly waited for the power to descend.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the gravitational force pressed down again, and he fell in front of the bronze mountain again.</p>

  <p>At that point, he roughly understood what was going on: he had entered a special "cycle", while the snake that ate itself on the bronze mountain also represented a unique cycle.</p>

  <p>"I guess that you have to obtain the bloodline of the 'Ultimate Cycle' through constant circulation," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>"That snake is called the Ouroboros. I've seen one in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore once. Its meaning was once compared to the chaos because the chaos is also a cycle that continuously repeats," he explained.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of the Ultimate Cycle bloodline?" Zheng asked. "Well, I don't know..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven shrugged.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven also found it hard to understand these worlds, but there was one thing he was sure— none of these four origin-level bloodlines was weak.</p>

  <p>"At least we know how to obtain the bloodline of the Infinite Reproduction, but there is absolutely no clue about the Ultimate Cycle. I'd better see the next one..."</p>

  <p>When he reached the bronze mountain again, Zheng abruptly flew towards the side.</p>

  <p>The gravitational force did not follow, but allowed Zheng to escape from it.</p>

  <p>Once he left the circle, he arrived at the far right side of the world. There was another crack there, and on both sides of the crack were two Sanskrit words. The Heavenly Obsession Civilization helped him decipher the messages as well.</p>

  <p>The first Sanskrit word explained the meaning of the "Ultimate Cycle", and it was almost the same as he had guessed before. He had to understand the painting of the Ouroboros through repetitive circulations of meditation.</p>

  <p>When he completely understood it, then he would naturally obtain this bloodline.</p>

  <p>The second Sanskrit word was worthy of his attention. After he entered the crack, he could acquire a bloodline called "Myriad Birth and Destruction".</p>

  <p>"The Ways-blending Energy in the chaos already has all essences, and the meaning of the 'Myriad Birth and Destruction' is not hard to imagine. Can it control the birth and destruction of all kinds of energy? If we analyze it literally, it shows that the bloodline is even more powerful," he said in a serious voice.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, that's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If the bloodlines could be understood literally, you will be able to reproduce millions of you once you obtain the Infinite Reproduction bloodline. Although these are origin-level bloodlines, they can't be that powerful."</p>

  <p>"You're right." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"But you have already mastered the Ways-blending Energy. Will the Myriad Birth and Destruction be helpful to the Godly Ways Great Unity?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at those words. He immediately entered the crack.</p>

  <p>In less than a second, he passed through the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He had first thought that the place of Myriad Birth and Destruction might have mixed with all sorts of complex energies.</p>

  <p>To his great surprise, the world in front of him was just a flat plain with some dead trees in the center. Purplish-black flowers continuously grew on the branches of the dead trees, and the new blossoms floated and disappeared in the wind.</p>

  <p>Zheng floated over and stood in the center of the dead trees. Suddenly, a strange feeling filled his heart, and he said, "Things are constantly born and grow; things constantly die and disappear. Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Myriad Birth and Destruction bloodline doesn't refer to energy, but all kinds of things."</p>
