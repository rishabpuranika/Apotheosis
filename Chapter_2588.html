  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lisa stared at Zheng, stunned.</p>

  <p>In the way she saw it, since Roy killed Monty, it was only natural that Zheng killed her too.</p>

  <p>But fortunately for her, Zheng showed mercy to her in the last moment.</p>

  <p>"I admit defeat," choked Lisa.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and loosened his grip on her.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng had spared his sister's life, Jerome, who was standing at a distance, breathed out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Then, both of them transformed, turned off their Wild God Power, and returned to their own races.</p>

  <p>"Amazing, Zheng! How did you break her sword net?" Romeo said excitedly as he bounded over to hug Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Nine Li race also looked eager to hear.</p>

  <p>Out of previous several battles, only Romeo won a battle and sadly, one of their members also got killed. It was a crushing defeat!</p>

  <p>If Zheng had lost and the news spread out, the sects which relied on the Nine Li race would have most likely lost respect for the Nine Li race and left.</p>

  <p>"With your strength, you'd have no trouble defeating everyone in the Yellow Emperor race," said Elsa, her big eyes crinkling happily.</p>

  <p>Adele also smiled at him. "There are still two tough battles ahead. You can't let your guard down, especially when fighting David."</p>

  <p>"Okay." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>When Zheng won the sixth battle, the members of the Nine Li race felt their hearts burst with pride and they had trouble containing their excitement.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the atmosphere on the Yellow Emperor race's side was grey, dull, and depressing.</p>

  <p>They didn't really care about losing this round, but the strength Zheng had shown in the battlefield struck them with fear.</p>

  <p>Lisa had fought with all her might and yet, she was easily defeated by Zheng..</p>

  <p>More importantly, Zheng hadn't moved from his spot for the entirety of the battle.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Zheng's strength was on a whole other level.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! That guy is really something. I bet Jerome won't be able to defeat him. It's my turn, isn't it?" said David as he sat on the ground.</p>

  <p>He was probably the most cheerful in the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Zheng, he would be lying on the ground all day, which was why he decided that he didn't dislike Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Lancelot, however, was getting pissed off and David's jests only soured his mood even more. He threw David a dirty look and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Jerome!"</p>

  <p>"I'm here!"</p>

  <p>Jerome, who was comforting his sister, immediately answered.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn now," barked Lancelot.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Jerome nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's a waste of time to let him fight now. I still have to fight in the end..."</p>

  <p>David muttered under his breath.</p>

  <p>"You may be disappointed," Jerome sneered.</p>

  <p>David licked his lips and laughed grimly. He didn't say anything else.</p>

  <p>Then, Jerome transformed into a giant ten thousand feet tall, with an eighty feet long broadsword in his hand.</p>

  <p>When Zheng appeared in front of him, he threw his sword into the ground and cupped his hands in front of him. "Thank you for sparing my sister's life!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised by the unexpected display of humility. He shook his head. "As long as the result of the battle comes out, I will stop. There's no need to fight with her life. It's normal that I don't kill her. You don't need to thank me."</p>

  <p>Jerome nodded as he reached for the broadsword. "But even in this case, I will still go all out!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't expect any less," Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>"Ha..."</p>

  <p>The moment Jerome pulled out the huge broadsword, his aura changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Wild Body emitted a wisp of golden light which constantly circled the surface of his body. His broadsword also emitted a tyrannical aura.</p>

  <p>Jerome's fighting style greatly differed from his sister's.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Zheng raised his arm lightly and the green sword circled around his arm and pointed to Jerome.</p>

  <p>Jerome stamped his foot lightly and a powerful force burst out.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The ground under his feet bulged. Aided with the explosive force, Jerome came at Zheng at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Compared to Lisa, Jerome had a weaker sense of space. However, he had the upper hand on the use of the Wild God Power!</p>

  <p>"Fast." Zheng's eyebrows raised slightly.</p>

  <p>Facing Jerome's attack, Zheng held his sword horizontally with his right hand and rested his left hand on the tip of the sword.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Jerome launched the domineering sword strike and hit Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>A strong force was produced by the impact and caused two ditches, several hundred feet wide and tens of thousands of feet long, to appear on the ground where Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Jerome stomped on the ground and leaped up like a giant ancient beast. His broadsword cut through the air, creating a bright silver radiance.</p>

  <p>"Earth Splitting Slash!"</p>

  <p>The power that Jerome burst out that instant was astounding.</p>

  <p>Some of the Wild Gods watching in the distance were rendered speechless by the display of such power.</p>

  <p>"Jerome is still as violent as before..."</p>

  <p>"He has such formidable power!"</p>

  <p>"Even though the brat from the Nine Li race defeated Lisa, it'll be difficult for him to defeat Jerome."</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng won against Lisa, these outsiders still thought he was only lucky to have defeated her.</p>

  <p>"Such incredible strength..."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Jerome with indifference and the power within his body began to surge.</p>

  <p>Up to now, he hadn't tried to use the full extent of his power.</p>

  <p>The power of the Wild God was far greater than that of the True God.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, the pure power did not have a huge effect. The True Gods all relied on the three thousand Godly Ways arranged in the divine land by Chiyou and the use of the strength source was not exactly seen as important.</p>

  <p>Zheng had learned from the exiles that even in chaos, the Wild Gods didn't play an important part in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors in the Source World all used the Grand World Cultivation Method because it was impossible for a cultivator to reach the Other Shore Realm while cultivating the Wild God system.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng had become the mid-rank Wild God and his body was filled with a massive amount of the Wild God Power. Plus, he could now use the strength source of the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>While the two were complementary to each other, the instant explosive power would be extremely terrifying!</p>

  <p>"Zheng, hurry up and dodge this strike!"</p>

  <p>"It's too late!"</p>

  <p>"Don't face it head on!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race got worried as they shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng could easily dodge the blow and launch a counterattack, but he stood firmly, unmoving.</p>

  <p>'Let's try something...'</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he side stepped smoothly, his cool and precise movements making him look like a fierce tiger.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Wild God Power all over his body erupted!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The emerald sword radiance cut through the sky and made a sharp whistling sound.</p>

  <p>Zheng had really planned to take that strike head on!</p>
