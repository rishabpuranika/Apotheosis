<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2373 Sneak Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Is the Heavenly Wheel Snake... dead?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Eagle, the Roc, and Swallow races were all shocked hearing Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>The snake that had threatened them for so long was finally gone!</p>

  <p>In fact, these three races despised one another all because of this Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of everything, they didn't really have a problem with each other at all.</p>

  <p>However, because of the Heavenly Wheel Snake, they had to offer their children at intervals. This was unacceptable for everyone, and it began the conflict between the races.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they began to snatch at each other's young boys and girls, offering them to the Heavenly Wheel Snake. Gradually, there grew a fierce conflict among the three races, which turned into an irreconcilable hatred.</p>

  <p>If the Heavenly Wheel Snake had really died, everyone knew that the hatred wouldn't disappear instantly, but would gradually fade over time.</p>

  <p>In the end, the source of the three races' hatred was merely a beastly snake.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" asked the chief who had been talking to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He asked with his eyes wide open, hardly believing what Luo Zheng had said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled, clutched the jade seal in his hand and infused an idea into it.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he pointed at a place not far away and said, "Look over there."</p>

  <p>The chief and other people looked in that direction, puzzled.</p>

  <p>For some reason, they saw nothing but a desert amidst them.</p>

  <p>As they squinted and searched for something to look at, a snake's hiss came from the ground. A small sand dune was blown up in the desert, as if something was about to break out of it.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be Heavenly Wheel Bugs?"</p>

  <p>"That's... impossible. The bugs in the desert won't appear during the day."</p>

  <p>The group murmured as they stared at the small sand dune.</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>"Chirp..."</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>The people were nervous, but the mysterious birds, golden rocs and eagles all fixed their eyes at the small sand dune with vigilance.</p>

  <p>As sharp as these birds were, they already knew that the Heavenly Wheel Bugs were coming out.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>It was exactly as they guessed. Within seconds, there were over a hundred Heavenly Wheel Bugs emerging from the desert, squirming and making hissing sounds all around.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavenly Wheel Bugs did not launch any attacks unlike what they'd expected. They just stuck out a part of their bodies outside the sand dune but refused to move at all.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, the chief widened his eyes and stared at those Heavenly Wheel Bugs. He then asked, "So you have controlled those bugs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," responded Luo Zheng. "I have controlled all the Heavenly Wheel Bugs in the desert and the sea of bugs." He then pointed to the bugs, and the bugs immediately retreated back to the ground. Then he said, "In the future, you won't need to offer your children. If you want to offer sacrifices, offer them to me."</p>

  <p>Everyone exchanged glances and held back their gasps. The chief and all the people were shocked. However, shock turned into excitement as they all roared, "Bravo!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo!"</p>

  <p>All the people in front of the altar rejoiced and gave each other high fives.</p>

  <p>At this point, they had endured so much humiliation for a long time.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while, they had to offer their descendants to the Heavenly Wheel Snake, which was a torment and nightmare for all of them. How could they not celebrate the news like this?</p>

  <p>As they rejoiced, the birds around them chirped in excitement, too. It seemed to be a victory for everyone.</p>

  <p>Holding the little boy in her arms, Nelly stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before they went to the Heavenly Wheel Temple, she once asked Luo Zheng how to save these children.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just told her to take it easy and see what would happen. She hadn't expected that Luo Zheng could really solve such impossible problems.</p>

  <p>Just then, a shadowy figure slowly moved forward among the crowd.</p>

  <p>The man moved in a strange way, making sure not to attract anyone's attention as if he were a wandering ghost.</p>

  <p>Brushing past everyone, he eventually approached Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The closer he got to Luo Zheng, the faster he began to move.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a transparent saber appeared in his hand and he held it up in the air.</p>

  <p>Wisps of purple lightning flowed through the blade of the transparent saber. It was a saber made by the famous weapon refiner named Mitchell, ranked among the top of the first-rate supreme primordial weapons in the divine land.</p>

  <p>So even though that man couldn't use any Divine Dao, he had used the power of his saber to its fullest potential. With all the strength he could muster up, he sliced across Luo Zheng's wrist with an accurate and swift speed.</p>

  <p>It was so strong that the full-force strike was irresistible.</p>

  <p>Because he moved so quickly, Luo Zheng did not notice him, and it was too late for him to activate the Redemption Armor to save his hand.</p>

  <p>By the time he noticed, he had already lost a hand, and a lot of blood was trickling down his side.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Luo Zheng's arm and the jade seal flew out.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>With a loud shriek, Nelly realized who the man was. It was Alfredo, the consummate True God of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Not all of the consummate True Gods were able to find the right path after entering this world.</p>

  <p>Some of them, such as the one from the Sword Clan, found the Heavenly Wheel Temple in advance and ended up dying alone in the desert.</p>

  <p>In the same way, Alfredo had also been searching for a long time in this world. He made some inquiries and finally found the Roc race which led him to find the clues about the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>By the time he arrived here, however, the consummate True Gods had already entered the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>Left with no choice, he had to go into hiding.</p>

  <p>He never would have guessed that Luo Zheng would have been the one to take out the jade seal from the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>Besides, Nelly, the girl from the Mu Clan, had become very intimate with Luo Zheng. What happened?</p>

  <p>Confused, Alfredo decided to take action.</p>

  <p>Initially, he had never taken Luo Zheng as a clan member. To him, Luo Zheng was just a foreign talent, something useful to the clan. No matter whether he was Mike's son or not, he knew that he would never accept him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng expected it the least, Alfredo launched a surprise attack on him.</p>

  <p>Weirdly enough, Luo Zheng was pretty calm when his arm was cut off. His body leaned back slightly and then he rushed forward at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>The moment he grabbed onto the jade seal, his first instinct was to reconvene the bugs through the seal.</p>

  <p>Right there and then, the giant bugs that lay resting began to move again.</p>

  <p>They swallowed a period of three seconds.</p>

  <p>As the bugs reemerged, Luo Zheng's figure flashed in a strange pattern.</p>

  <p>Just like that, his severed arm was once again connected into one.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" With his eyes wide open, Alfredo watched the scene in a daze. Did he just do that?</p>

  <p>Within seconds, Luo Zheng held the jade seal with one hand, took Nelly with another hand and launched them up to the sky. He hovered in the air and looked down at Alfredo, with a self-satisfied smirk across his face.</p>

  <p>He had no idea that Alfredo would go and attack him. However, he smirked because it seemed he still succeeded despite Alfredo's attempt.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not have much time to study the jade seal, and he was not sure if he would become its owner.</p>

  <p>Also, if Alfredo took the jade seal, Luo Zheng would lose absolutely everything.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Alfredo didn't expect that Luo Zheng would be able to retaliate so quickly. His expression changed several times before he said,</p>

  <p>"Tianxing! As a member of my clan, you must give me the jade seal after you get it!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng sneered and said coldly, "If you thought I would just hand it to you, you wouldn't have had to attack me." He chuckled and continued, "Why do you speak such nonsense?"</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes, Alfredo added, "Give me the jade seal. Give it to me and I'll protect you from the Mu Clan's attack..."</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his words, Nelly interrupted with a hissing tone, "You are stupid, but I didn't think you'd be this stupid. What a dumb excuse coming from you!"</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Nelly choked Alfredo off, and Alfredo was rendered speechless. His eyes were twitching constantly, and he began to regret the course of actions that he just took.</p>

  <p>But as he pondered, Luo Zheng had already flown away.</p>

  <p>He knew that he didn't want to waste his time on consummate True Gods. Heck, he had more important things to do besides getting the jade seal.</p>
