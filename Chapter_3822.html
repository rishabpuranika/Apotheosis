<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3822 Glazed Body </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts stopped when they saw the broken limbs on the ground suddenly move.</p>

  <p>Was she still alive?</p>

  <p>Creatures that had reached the True God Realm possessed immensely strong and persistent life energy. To lose hands, legs, and even internal organs wasn't a big deal.</p>

  <p>However, even when warriors reached the Other Shore Realm, their two most important body parts, namely the soul and the cinnabar field, couldn't sustain serious injuries. If their cinnabar field was destroyed, they would lose all their cultivation; if it was their soul, then they would die.</p>

  <p>None of the creatures Luo Zheng had encountered could break such a rule. Even the Blood Spirit Tortoise, one of the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos, was no exception. It would die like the others if its Soul of Light was damaged.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng showed no mercy at all to the fox girl, with the only desire to kill her.</p>

  <p>His powerful attack had crushed her into pieces? but she was still alive?</p>

  <p>"She... is fine?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of monster is she? Her soul was not hurt at all?"</p>

  <p>"This is impossible..."</p>

  <p>At first, everyone assumed that Luo Zheng and Egan had killed the fox girl. They felt ecstatic as they thought that they could finally escape death, but now, it didn't seem like it.</p>

  <p>The maimed limbs on the ground moved slowly, and at the same time, the black clumps merged and reconstructed.</p>

  <p>By the time the pool of black clumps and body parts reached the door of the room, it already took the shape of the fox girl.</p>

  <p>"She's back," Egan said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Then let's do it again," Luo Zheng answered indifferently.</p>

  <p>In any case, there was no other efficient way to deal with the fox girl now.</p>

  <p>If they could still tear her to pieces, then they would do it all over again.</p>

  <p>There was no way the fox could be reborn infinitely!</p>

  <p>Egan had already pulled back his Soul-trapping Rope. However, when the fox girl entered the hexagram array again, he quickly tossed the Soul-trapping Rope to bind her once more.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng suddenly unleashed his power and blasted it towards the fox girl.</p>

  <p>However, the fox girl's body now shone with a glassy luster. Her snow-white skin became translucent, and her body became extraordinarily strong after her transformation.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The moment she saw Luo Zheng's fist coming at her, she had already raised her hand and smoothly grabbed it.</p>

  <p>She had effortlessly blocked a punch that contained eighty thousand Jun of force! "Do you think the rope can trap me?"</p>

  <p>The fox girl grabbed his fist with one hand and the Soul-trapping Rope with the other.</p>

  <p>"It can't?" Egan narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>He already had a bad feeling when he saw the fox girl's skin become a glazed color. If the Soul-trapping Rope had restrained her, she wouldn't be able to change into such a state. The only possible explanation was that the rope had lost its effect on her.</p>

  <p>At that point, the fox girl grabbed the Soul-trapping Rope and slightly pulled it. The other end of the rope slipped from Egan's grip, and then she casually threw it on the ground. Her big eyes shifted to Luo Zheng, and a smile graced her translucent face. "You haven't given up yet? The rest gave up already."</p>

  <p>Most of the Other Shore creatures in the room lost their will to fight. They either pinned their hopes on Luo Zheng who still fought, or waited for death. Only Egan and Kirk looked determined to battle.</p>

  <p>However, the man in front of her was completely different. His eyes burned with fire, and although he was silent, his fighting spirit fiercely surged inside him. He had no intention of giving up.</p>

  <p>"Why should I give up?" he shot back.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and put his hand on the fox girl's shoulder.</p>

  <p>After the fox girl's body became translucent, it became smooth and extremely tough. Luo Zheng tightly grasped her shoulder and swept her off the ground, then forcefully threw her behind him.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The energy waves from the impact spread out in all directions. Those Other Shore creatures who leaned against the wall felt that it was so strong that they could hardly breathe.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization had built the room that contained the hexagram array using rules, and it was almost unbreakable. Since the ground was quite solid, it caused a loud collision.</p>

  <p>However, the fox girl with the glazed body did not have any cracks on her body.</p>

  <p>Her body still remained upside down and she looked at Luo Zheng with a mocking smile. "Ninety thousand Jun of force? Is this your limit?" she sneered.</p>

  <p>In a close combat, Luo Zheng could release about two hundred thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, his Chaotic Source Spirits would be temporarily exhausted. Although the time was short, it was still quite dangerous.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he made sure that he released no more than one hundred thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the fox girl's mocking expression, he kicked her high into the air. Then, he bent down and released a large amount of force.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he threw another punch at her chest.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the fox girl flew away and slammed into the wall.</p>

  <p>She landed beside an Other Shore creature who trembled violently in fear. If she had hit him, then he would've died already.</p>

  <p>"That's not enough," the fox girl said with a taunting smile. She was getting serious in killing him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, her body's translucent glazed color gradually faded away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently raised his left hand and winked at Egan. "Egan!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as the Soul-trapping Rope wound around her body once again.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul-trapping Rope tied the fox girl, her face froze for a moment. She hurriedly put her slender index finger and thumb together, but she couldn't trigger the power of the token. The Soul-trapping Rope had taken effect.</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows shot up as her somewhat childish face sneered. She felt humiliated now that they saw through her. "Very good. Since you want to die more miserably, I'll satisfy you!" she scowled.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Soul-trapping Rope worked after all. At the very least, it stopped her from putting her fingers together and using the strange token. She could still turn into her glazed form but was unable to use the token.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng's idea. Earlier, when the fox girl had snatched the Soul-trapping Rope and threw it on the ground, he secretly asked Egan to pick it up through his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Even though he didn't know what tricks and theurgies the fox girl had up her sleeves, he couldn't withstand the strange power she released when she put her index finger and thumb together. With the help of the Soul-trapping Rope, he could at least prevent her from using that kind of token.</p>

  <p>Just then, her skin turned into the glazed color again. At the same time, she stretched out her hand then tried to snatch the Soul-trapping Rope.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Egan was very smart. He pulled back the Soul-trapping Rope in time and watched over the fox girl vigilantly.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was a life-and-death battle, so he was not afraid of offending her.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I'll just kill you!"</p>

  <p>The fox girl didn't want to play the seesaw game with Egan. Her face became filled with rage, and she immediately stabbed the head of the Other Shore creature beside her with her glazed hand.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>The head of the Other Shore creature exploded like a watermelon.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, her petite body, which didn't reach Luo Zheng's chest, crashed against him.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As a result, Luo Zheng was thrown away and crashed against the wall on the other side.</p>

  <p>The fox girl was very confident in her glazed body, and that was exactly what he wanted.</p>
