  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled with satisfaction and said, "One more point. I shall take half the heritage of the sixth-grade sect."</p>

  <p>"Half?" Tia was enraged. "Half the heritage of the sixth-grade sect? Do you know what that means? You are not able to bear that. It's too much for you!"</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall was merely a fourth-grade sect but enough to be highly reputed in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>And the only fifth-grade sect could rank No.1 in the Central Region. If this sixth-grade sect did not wither away and lasted till now, it was definitely the most highly reputed and all other sects and forces would kneel before them.</p>

  <p>Though the sixth-grade sect founded by the Blood Fiend Emperor had been destroyed, and most of its heritage had been seized as time passed, Cloud Hall could not match the sixth-grade's legacy that remained.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Tia thought Zheng was greedy.</p>

  <p>Zheng chuckled. "Don't worry. I am a big eater. Of course, you could choose to refuse and deal with that enchanted barrier by yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>The fiery dragon spirit roared and knocked the ice phoenix down. The surface ice layer of the ice phoenix turned to steam due to the high temperature.</p>

  <p>Tia was forced to calm down and deliver freezing air to the ice phoenix via the jade.</p>

  <p>'It seems I have no choice but to reach a compromise with this guy.' Tia thought, 'His condition sounds exorbitant, but how much inheritance could he carry by himself? Perhaps this is not a bad agreement. After all, he is a disciple of Cloud Hall, and he is honorable.'</p>

  <p>After thinking through her options, Tia knew she had no other alternatives. She gnashed her teeth as she replied, "Okay, I promise. By my will of martial arts, I swear I won't kill you and that I will give you half the heritage!"</p>

  <p>Tia was reluctant. She had schemed and tried several times before coming this far. It was hard to accept that half of her reward would be taken away.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tia swear by her will of martial arts, Zheng smiled, turned, and moved toward the enchanted barrier. He then threw a punch at it.</p>

  <p>"Snicker!"</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier did not shatter under the impact. However, a red cobweb-like vein spread across it.</p>

  <p>This barrier was far stronger than Yolande's. Even though he yielded the energy of the Emerald Crystal, Zheng could only cause such a subtle vein, which was invisible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"Emerald energy?" Tia was intrigued, and her beautiful eyes reflected the shock she felt.</p>

  <p>'How could this guy summon the energy of an Emerald Crystal by using his mortal body?</p>

  <p>Very few people possess an Emerald Crystal. It has limited usage as well.</p>

  <p>Thus, it's difficult to get one. Even if people acquire one, they are likely to set it in their weapon.</p>

  <p>But how can Zheng's punch be powered with the energy of an Emerald Crystal? Did he set the Emerald Crystal in his body? How could that be?</p>

  <p>The human body rejects most gems, and some are fatal as they are poisonous. An Emerald Crystal will affect a human body even if it's nontoxic. But Zheng's punch shows the energy of an Emerald Crystal, which indicates that he must have set it in his body.</p>

  <p>But how could he utilize and control this energy? His body is not a weapon, after all.'</p>

  <p>Tia was intelligent enough to recognize Zheng's cultivation method and identify his basic swordsmanship at first sight. However, she didn't know that Zheng's body had become a spiritual weapon. He was a weapon! That was why the Emerald Crystal could be set in his body.</p>

  <p>Though shocked, Tia knew she selected the right person to help her break the enchanted barrier. After all, Zheng yielded the energy of an Emerald Crystal. At the same time, she realized she knew little about Zheng.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier was so robust that it couldn't be broken by one punch, but one crack was enough.</p>

  <p>Then……</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>This time Zheng threw a blow with his right fist. Simultaneously, he released the condensed demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Ogre Fist!"</p>

  <p>Having learned from the experience of breaking Yolande's enchanted barrier, Zheng threw this punch at the red cobweb-like vein. The billowy demonic life vitality flowed into the enchanted barrier like a flood.</p>

  <p>This layer of enchanted barrier contained a hint of spatial power, which was so strong that the enchanted barrier remained intact though Zheng had done this much. However, the internal space of the enchanted barrier had filled with demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, Zheng whispered, "Explode!"</p>

  <p>The starlight mixed with the demonic life vitality exploded, and dazzling light was emitted.</p>

  <p>"Rumble……"</p>

  <p>Cracks finally appeared. These cracks spread, and within seconds, the enchanted barrier collapsed with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>"It is broken!"</p>

  <p>While Zheng dealt with the enchanted barrier, Tia battled with the fiery dragon spirit. She was delighted when she heard the barrier break. She pressed down with two fingers, and the ice phoenix screeched as it subdued the fiery dragon spirit.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a flow of purple light rushed into the furnace.</p>

  <p>It was so fast, yet Zheng and Tia recognized it to be a tiny flood dragon!</p>

  <p>"This is the spirit of the flood dragon. Zheng, catch it!" The cyan dragon's voice exploded in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>However, the tiny purple flood dragon was well prepared as it rushed into the furnace as soon as the enchanted barrier broke. What was worse, it carried the crystal key in its tail as it fled.</p>

  <p>"Ahahah, I have the heritage of the sixth-grade sect. Using this, I will be able to rebuild my body. I will take back all that I have lost!" The flood dragon's spirit cackled as it spoke.</p>

  <p>Tia became upset when she saw the flood dragon's spirit flying away with the crystal key. She returned the ice phoenix into her jade, ignored the fiery dragon spirit, and turned to chase the flood dragon's spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed her as he wanted the crystal key and the flood dragon's spirit.</p>

  <p>However, the two did not notice that the fire extinguished when the fiery dragon spirit returned to the furnace. An instant later, a giant fiery dragon rushed out of the furnace. The fiery dragon spirit grew tenfold before it chased Zheng and Tia.</p>

  <p>Although as tiny as a human's arm, the flood dragon's spirit still flew as fast as before even though it was carrying the crystal key. Fortunately, there was only one long and narrow path through the dragon's body.</p>

  <p>Thus, the flood dragon's spirit could not shake Zheng and Tia quickly.</p>

  <p>Tia was infuriated with this situation. After innumerable trials and hardships, and compromising with Zheng by giving up half the heritage, she had still not achieved her mission.</p>

  <p>Quickly, she pulled out her jade and crushed it between her fingers. Once the blue jade had crumbled, the phoenix lost its place and began flying around Tia.</p>

  <p>Tia murmured, "Ice phoenix! Possess me!"</p>

  <p>The little ice phoenix warbled and rushed toward Tia. Then, she was surrounded by a crystal sheen. It seemed as though she were wearing ice armor. Even a pair of ice phoenix wings sprouted from her back! From under the wings, two long phoenix feathers extended to the ground.</p>

  <p>Overall, Tia looked as though she were wearing a gorgeous evening dress knit from ice.</p>

  <p>"Tia merged with that little ice phoenix?" Zheng said, astonished.</p>

  <p>Tia's speed increased manifold. Without waiting for Zheng, she doubled her efforts as she chased the flood dragon's spirit!</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, Tia was twice as fast as Lewis. And now, her speed was far more than Zheng's, so she left Zheng behind as she caught up with the tiny flood dragon's spirit.</p>

  <p>This was a great chance for the flood dragon's spirit to alter its life. It was not easy for it to escape from the seal, and so, it would not give up easily. Holding the crystal key tightly, it flew as fast as it could. Since spirits had no weight, it wasn't hard for the flood dragon's spirit to gain speed.</p>

  <p>"Zoom, zoom!"</p>

  <p>Tia waved her hand, and a row of ice darts flew to the flood dragon's spirit. The spirit dodged the ice darts.</p>

  <p>The ice darts missed their target and crashed into the wall. As tremendous ice power was released, the wall became covered with a layer of ice and frost before it cracked.</p>

  <p>'Ice power is horrifying! I'm afraid I will become an ice sculpture if the darts hit me.' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Though terrifying, the ice power was useless as the flood dragon spirit was extremely nimble. It escaped all the ice darts Tia had thrown at it.</p>

  <p>However, continually dodging Tia's attacks slowed down the flood dragon's spirit. Tia got closer and closer.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon's spirit realized that it could not get rid of Tia like this.</p>

  <p>So it swerved into a crevice in the wall.</p>

  <p>Now that the ice phoenix had possessed her body, Tia could yield its power effectively. She spread her arms, and two thin ice swords appeared in her hands. She swung the swords, crumbed wall, and rushed into the hole.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw what Tia had done and found himself impressed by her abilities.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, he followed her into the crevice.</p>

  <p>The instant he entered the hole, he felt as though something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The wall was a part of the flood dragon's flesh. It hadn't been transformed by humans yet. And so, the inner space was still a soft flesh wall.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, many globoids were floating in the upper space.</p>

  <p>After looking upwards, Tia said, "You won't escape!"</p>

  <p>Then she jumped and flew to the upper space, the two long ice feathers trailing behind her.</p>

  <p>However, the floating globoids fell at this crucial moment. Tia swiveled her swords spontaneously to cut all the globoids.</p>

  <p>"Sough……"</p>

  <p>The balls burst and released a yellow smog that filled the space. The gas released smelled fishy and sweet and carried the metallic scent of blood.</p>

  <p>Right after Tia was overwhelmed by the smog, the flood dragon's spirit rushed to Zheng and yelled, "I will snatch your body shell first!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng paused for a while and then replied, "Are you sure you want to snatch my body shell?"</p>
