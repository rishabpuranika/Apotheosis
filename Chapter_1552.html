<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, Soul Sea Realm warriors should only need three life vitality jades to replenish their Soul Seas.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille was different. As the ace talent in her family, she was personally assisted by her patriarch in expanding her Soul Sea by three times when she established it.</p>

  <p>This was essential since she practiced the Five Elements Godly Way which made her consume far more life vitality than the average warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng's chaotic Soul Sea was quite suitable for the Five Elements Godly Way if one thought about it since the chaotic energy condensed within his body was far greater than an ordinary life vitality sea.</p>

  <p>Lucille, who needed to replenish her Soul Sea, quickly shattered ten life vitality jades all at once.</p>

  <p>A torrential rain suddenly poured down in her inner world, flooding her almost dried-up Soul Sea with much-needed life vitality.</p>

  <p>As she got her bearings, Lucille couldn't help but stare at Luo Zheng in astonishment.</p>

  <p>She never thought his strength would be this terrifying!</p>

  <p>Or was it strength? That couldn't be it. Lucille was someone who had witnessed many displays of innate superhuman strength. Norton was a good example.</p>

  <p>That guy and also his father were both born with great strength and berserker-like qualities. Norton's father had the cultivation of a world lord and was quite famous in the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>They were the type of people who drew confidence from their bodies' strength and used whatever means to fight for what they wanted.</p>

  <p>For them, reaching an extremely terrifying level of sheer strength was paramount. It was by relying on pure energy could they hope to one day shatter space, destroy the heavens, and become gods.</p>

  <p>Such was the way of a berserker warrior.</p>

  <p>Of course, nobody knew for certain if what people like Norton and his father aimed for was possible. Nobody had yet reached such a level of strength to shatter space and destroy the heavens in the current grand era.</p>

  <p>However, the universe was filled with countless warriors with varying cultivation methods. No one way was absolute.</p>

  <p>For some, strength was the only way to go while others might not necessarily think the same way.</p>

  <p>Norton, however, was his father's successor and surely went on to follow his path.</p>

  <p>He was already pretty powerful as a Soul Sea Realm warrior. Lucille herself had never seen anyone on par with him when it came to strength.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had been able to kill both Norton and Ethan.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just strength that Luo Zheng possessed but superhuman power. Norton and Ethan were no match for him.</p>

  <p>However, there were varying opinions among the crowd watching.</p>

  <p>"Just now, Lucille must've been at a disadvantage!"</p>

  <p>"She used the power of the five elements but what kind of power did that young man use? I didn't feel any life vitality fluctuation from his body."</p>

  <p>"If I'm not wrong, I think all he did was use his body's strength. He didn't activate his life vitality or use any forceful energy."</p>

  <p>This remark momentarily stunned the crowd into silence. All of them looked at the person who spoke with wide eyes before erupting into a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? How can pure physical strength have such an effect?"</p>

  <p>"I also think it's impossible."</p>

  <p>The crowd was divided in whether or not Luo Zheng only used his physical strength but they could all agree that Lucille had just suffered a loss in this fight.</p>

  <p>This was very much obvious to them.</p>

  <p>The ten life vitality jades had done their work stabilizing Lucille whose face was slowly regaining that healthy glow. However, her mind was currently in a state of shambles.</p>

  <p>It was pretty clear to her now that she was scared of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, hadn't moved at all.</p>

  <p>He merely stood his ground and had a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The spectators on top of the city wall were still at a loss as to how Luo Zheng forced Lucille to retreat. He didn't use any theurgy at all, so how exactly did he do it? They could only scratch their heads in frustration as they thought of a possible answer.</p>

  <p>Lucille had been forced into submission twice now. Back when Luo Zheng summoned the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, she had summoned a burst of golden wind in order to retreat into safety.</p>

  <p>Could it be that Luo Zheng was even stronger than Lucille?</p>

  <p>There weren't many ace talents among the juniors. The ones who stood at the top were only those capable of leading the world of chaos, meaning they would be mainstays once the heavens' calamity came.</p>

  <p>However, there were perhaps thousands of these highly talented warriors scattered across the universe. The heavens had sown many seeds but not every single one could grow strong and tall. Only the best among the seeds could hope to emerge on top.</p>

  <p>Where did Luo Zheng come from?</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors here came from the Thoughtless Minds and could easily recognize the names of those ace talents in their group. They knew of their backgrounds, their identities, and their capabilities.</p>

  <p>Nathan Xuanyuan and Lawson Lie, for example, were the ace talents in their group.</p>

  <p>However, this young man in front of them was unknown. There was no way they wouldn't be able to recognize him if he was from the Thoughtless Minds. Someone so powerful couldn't have stayed in the shadows for so long.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood his ground and gave Lucille enough time to sort herself out, not taking advantage of the fact that she was running out of life vitality.</p>

  <p>She might be hard to deal with but Luo Zheng wasn't someone who fought dirty.</p>

  <p>So long as she didn't try to escape to the main city, then his victory was assured. But Luo Zheng wasn't worried about that. He didn't think it was in her personality to run back and cower within the main city's walls.</p>

  <p>Inside Lucille's Soul Sea, the torrential rains had finished pouring and her life vitality sea had slowly filled up and calmed down from the unprecedented storm.</p>

  <p>She had previously tried to suppress Luo Zheng using her cultivation base but she never expected that she would be at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Still, she wasn't completely powerless. Lucille still had a few tricks up her sleeves.</p>

  <p>Her attitude towards this fight had now gone a complete 180. She knew she had to take this seriously now.</p>

  <p>Lucille straightened and gently stood on tiptoe. As she did this, a faint ray of light appeared on her crescent embroidered shoes.</p>

  <p>These shoes initially looked like a pair of ordinary cloth shoes but the light quickly spread around her feet and turned into a sharp Crescent Blade.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Lucille intertwined her arms and summoned a gentle, golden wind, causing her figure to disappear.</p>

  <p>The sight of the Crescent Blade alarmed Luo Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>It was the moment he realized that Lucille wasn't the same as Norton, Layne, or the other warriors from before.</p>

  <p>Those were mere small-fry he could defeat easily.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille was someone he could very well lose to if he wasn't careful.</p>

  <p>So the moment she disappeared with her Crescent Blade, Luo Zheng quickly summoned a white mist and let it surround his body.</p>

  <p>"The Eight Smoky Melodies."</p>

  <p>He was able to activate it just in time to come face to face with Lucille.</p>

  <p>The golden wind aided her speed and helped her get to Luo Zheng quickly. The young girl was upside down and obviously looked at him with intense killing intent.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Her entire body spun 180 degrees and the Crescent Blade on her feet drew a blinding half-circle as it came slashing down towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These events all happened extremely fast.</p>

  <p>From the moment Luo Zheng activated the Eight Smoky Melodies to Lucille slashing down the Crescent Blade towards him - everything took place in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The spectators were at the edge of their seats. One moment Lucille was shattering life vitality jades and the next she was upside down and already so close to Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng couldn't help but think just how lucky it was that he was able to activate the Eight Smoky Melodies just in time. Any strike from Lucille would cut his head off already if he wasn't careful.</p>

  <p>He quickly flew backwards just as she struck.</p>

  <p>But the Eight Smoky Melodies' reaction was quite slow.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng was able to avoid his opponents' attacks effortlessly. The fiercer and faster the attacks, the better he could dodge them.</p>

  <p>He was always able to maintain a distance of three inches between him and his opponents.</p>

  <p>That time, when he faced against an ogre warrior in the wilderness who shot an arrow at him, Luo Zheng was able to dodge it with mere three inches to spare.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille's movements were incredibly fast, far surpassing the Eight Smoky Melodies' limits. The Crescent Blade had gone past the distance of three inches and was close to slashing Zheng's face!</p>
