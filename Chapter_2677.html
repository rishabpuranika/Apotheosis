<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been almost ten years since they had met in the Sunrest Tree last time.</p>

  <p>But Rachelle had never forgotten Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whenever she remembered Luo Zheng's face, the humiliation of her defeat in his hands replayed in her mind.</p>

  <p>It was because she was incredibly competitive that she couldn't accept such a failure. The shame of being insulted by a low-rank True God would be something she would never forget for the rest of her life!</p>

  <p>The hatred grew in her heart until it turned into her inner demon.</p>

  <p>"You have stepped into the consummation of True God Realm!" It was a shock to Rachelle when she saw that Luo Zheng had improved so much in his cultivation.</p>

  <p>She could only watch helplessly as he rapidly improved from a low-rank True God and became a consummate True God in just ten years. It was hard for her to accept it.</p>

  <p>"It's... It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>There was also clear disbelief on Shahn's shocked face.</p>

  <p>They were top figures in powerful clans on the Floating Islands, and they had seen many extraordinary talents in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Some talents improved their cultivation with great speed.</p>

  <p>With the support of rich resources on a Floating Island, it usually took only ten years for a warrior to become a top-rank True God from a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>There were quite many people who achieved that. The Fang Clan and the Mu Clan had a couple of such talents, to say the least.</p>

  <p>However, it was astonishing and hard for Shahn and Rachelle to accept that a low-rank True God reached the consummation of True God Realm in just ten years.</p>

  <p>Reaching the consummation of True God Realm was a million times harder than reaching the common True God Realm!</p>

  <p>There were plenty of True Gods in the divine land and the top-rank True Gods among them was many. However, the number of consummate True Gods was few and far between, just a little more than the number of Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>For example, the top-rank True Gods around the Godly Way Tablet only wanted to enter the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods were only a step away from reaching the consummation of True God Realm, but this step was like a vast chasm.</p>

  <p>The majority of them would never cross this gap their whole lives!</p>

  <p>There was a saying in the divine land that went, "One step to become a consummate True God, a half more to become a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>The strength of a consummate True God was just a little inferior to a Demi-holy Being. They all had the qualifications to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings and compete for the opportunity to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>There were many examples of consummate True Gods successfully becoming Holy Beings in the history of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng had extraordinary talents, he still needed to get through the two bottlenecks in the Emotion Closing Godly Way: the Formless State and the Nothingness In One. He wouldn't have reached the consummation of True God Realm if it hadn't been for Fuxi's help.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Luo Zheng had been focusing wholeheartedly on the study of merging Goldly Ways and he had made no progress in the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>It was hard to say how long it would have taken him to reach the consummation of True God Realm if he hadn't met Fuxi...</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the time Luo Zheng spent on comprehending the Emotion Closing Godly Way was greatly shortened by taking advantage of the Eight Diagrams Chart with Fuxi's help.</p>

  <p>"Are you surprised?" Luo Zheng stared at Rachelle indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am." Rachelle stared at Luo Zheng's smiling face and felt the indescribable rage blaze in her heart as she kept her voice calm. "If it weren't for the difference in our stands, I would admire my sister who found you special long ago. With only ten years of time, you stepped into the consummation of True God Realm. Such a genius indeed hasn't existed before and probably would never be seen again in this world," she said as she stretched out her hands.</p>

  <p>Two scarlet runes appeared on the wrists of her arms and then two short scarlet swords "grew" out from her arms.</p>

  <p>"What a pity!" Rachel sneered and the killing intent in her eyes became darker.</p>

  <p>A palm sized cyan disc surrounded by cyan twigs appeared in Shahn's hand behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The twigs started to burn as he placed his hand on the disc...</p>

  <p>While the twigs were burning, in the Sea Vessel Region...</p>

  <p>Walton and two other consummate True Gods flew towards their destination at a high speed.</p>

  <p>Walton noticed that there was something strange in his space ring and when he tapped it, a cyan disc similar to Shahn's appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The twigs on his cyan disc were also burning.</p>

  <p>"So soon?" It made Walton's eyes widen.</p>

  <p>"What's up, Walton?" another consummate True God from the Tang Clan asked.</p>

  <p>"It's the Square Sky Region." Walton stared at the disc as he replied,</p>

  <p>"Rachelle and Shahn have found the target. Let's go back!"</p>

  <p>All the consummate True Gods had gone out to search for the target and thirteen cyan discs were distributed to the groups heading to thirteen different regions.</p>

  <p>The twigs intertwined around the cyan discs were picked up from the Ray Tree and they were all collected from the same branch.</p>

  <p>Whoever found the target would set the cyan disc ablaze.</p>

  <p>There were something special about the twigs on the Ray Tree. As long as the twigs were from the same branch, no matter how far apart they were, when one burned, the others would also be on fire!</p>

  <p>So after the twigs on Shahn's cyan disc were set on fire, the twigs on the other twelve cyan discs started to burn.</p>

  <p>According to the location of fire burning on the disc, they would be able to know who had found the target!</p>

  <p>In the Magic Door Region...</p>

  <p>Tianming stood on a hilltop and looked at the disc in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Lowell, what's going on?"</p>

  <p>Behind him were two consummate True Gods of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, Tianming had made a lot of extraordinary achievements in the Dongfang Clan, especially in the Abyss Demon Region where he saved people from dire situations many times.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although Tianming was a junior, he had a high prestige.</p>

  <p>"It's in the northwest," Tianming said as he stared at the direction the twigs burned. "The Square Sky Region! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>With that, Tianming darted towards the Square Sky Region with the two consummate True Gods at full speed.</p>

  <p>Tianming was also very curious about this mission.</p>

  <p>Who was so powerful that the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands made such a big move to find him? They even used the Ruling Slate to seal the space of the thirteen big regions.</p>

  <p>He had a vague hunch that something would happen...</p>

  <p>The Flying Bell Region...</p>

  <p>The Yellow Dragon Region...</p>

  <p>The Cloud Peak Region...</p>

  <p>All the scattered consummate True Gods in the thirteen large regions received the message and rushed towards the Square Sky Region.</p>

  <p id="top_22">The space of the large regions was sealed by the Ruling Slate so they were also limited by the rule like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to travel through transmission arrays nor could they use Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Any move that would trigger the Space Law would be punished by the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>They could only move to another region at their fastest speed and teleport from there. When they arrived in the neighboring region of Square Sky Region, they would enter the Square Sky Region from there.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle transformed into a flash of bloody radiance as she swung her two blood red short swords and dashed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well prepared to face her attack.</p>

  <p>He leaned back and his long sword came into his hand, a long streak of light shooting out!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud sound.</p>

  <p>The streak of light Luo Zheng slashed out landed on Rachelle's short sword.</p>

  <p>After refraction, it came down from the height of ten thousand feet in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>In an instant, the unremarkable streak of light split a mountain range below right in the middle.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>After he launched the strike, Luo Zheng stabilized himself and quickly ran without any intention of continuing the fight!</p>
