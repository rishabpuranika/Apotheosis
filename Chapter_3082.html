<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Most importantly, they've destroyed more than forty bottles of the Sword-reading Liquid."</p>

  <p>As Gant said this, his distress showed all over his face.</p>

  <p>One bottle of the Sword-reading Liquid was worth 15, 000 divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Over 40 bottles could be sold more than 600, 000 divine crystals. This was a loss that was hard to swallow.</p>

  <p>But Zheng cared little about the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>As long as he could acquire the Heavenly Pure Liquid, he could make as much Sword-reading Liquid as he wanted.</p>

  <p>What bothered him was that Beldene and Faegan were beaten black and blue. He had to do something about this.</p>

  <p>"Who is this Fergus?" Zheng asked coldly, filled with rage.</p>

  <p>Just as Gant was about to answer, another voice chimed in, "He's an Alliance Chief in the Dragon City."</p>

  <p>It came from Monica.</p>

  <p>She rushed over as fast as she could when she heard about the accident.</p>

  <p>She swept through Beldene and Faegan with her spiritual sense while she answered Zheng. When she found the two of them were not seriously injured, she breathed a huge sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"An Alliance Chief?" An icy look flashed through Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, just forget about it. He comes from a powerful lineage. It would be better to not provoke him," suggested Monica.</p>

  <p>If Fergus was only an ordinary Alliance Chief, Monica wouldn't stop Zheng, but that was not the case.</p>

  <p>Although those supporting Zheng did not reveal all their strength, Monica knew that very few in the Dragon City could challenge Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fergus was an Alliance Chief but he was not able to make the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>He was just a glorified salesman, bringing it down from the Oneness Sky Palace to sell for its maker.</p>

  <p>Who was this from above capable of making the Sword-reading Liquid?</p>

  <p>Someone who was capable of Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Such a person would have a region under their control, a bright future ahead of them, be a true powerhouse. It would be unwise to offend them.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," Zheng sneered. He looked at Gant and asked, "Where do they sell the Sword-reading Liquid? Take me there. Now."</p>

  <p>All the Sword-reading Liquid was transported from the market to outside the Sword Wall. This was also Fergus' mode of business.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, are you really going to..." Gant stammered nervously, trying to stop Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Take me there!" Zheng ordered in a tone that allowed no response.</p>

  <p>Now that he was a Flag Master and the disciples were his subordinates, it was his duty to avenge those below him who had been wronged and hurt.</p>

  <p>Right from the start, Gant had warned the disciples to control their tempers towards Fergus, or they'd leave Zheng in a dilemma as he now was.</p>

  <p>Heeding his words, Kenelm, Jago and Elgin had suppressed their anger.</p>

  <p>They feared Zheng would be a victim of revenge after enacting his own for them. After all, this was Fergus' territory and Zheng's foundation here was too shallow to make him strong here.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's mind was made up and this somehow got everyone excited.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you there!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Let's go! I know where they are!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>The disciples began escorting Zheng to the market. Monica saw she could do nothing more now and so gritted her teeth and said, "It seems like we're about to have quite an eventful day."</p>

  <p>Gant shrugged his shoulders and said, "You've read my mind. Couldn't you turn to Master Walter for help?"</p>

  <p>Walter Tong was one of the three top Alliance Chiefs in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Monica achieved her current status with the help of Walter.</p>

  <p>"Even if Master Walter were to step in, it would be of no use. Fergus will still do as he pleases," Monica sighed, shaking her head woefully.</p>

  <p>With his powerful background, Fergus was considered special in the Dragon City. Even those Alliance Chiefs whose strength was far above his own didn't dare to provoke him. Therefore, Walter would not be able to solve the problem either.</p>

  <p>"We might as well go with them," said Gant, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>The two of them followed behind the group.</p>

  <p>The group passed through the market aggressively, attracting a lot of attention as they went by.</p>

  <p>But when the others figured out their cultivation levels, disdain appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"They are Sword-reading Liquid sellers."</p>

  <p>"They competed with Fergus for business and paid the price today. Don't they know that only Fergus can sell the Sword-reading Liquid here?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that they are here for revenge."</p>

  <p>"Look at their Flag Master. He's only reached the Other Shore Realm. He's too weak to take revenge on Fergus' men. He's just courting death."</p>

  <p>Everyone in the market seemed to assume they knew the result of what was about to happen.</p>

  <p>It was boring to cultivate in the Dragon City. Those in the market saw this as good entertainment. Some even closed their stores to follow behind the group as well.</p>

  <p>After passing two streets, Kenelm pointed to a place close by and said,</p>

  <p>"Right there."</p>

  <p>Fergus' large stall occupied almost half the street.</p>

  <p>Many people bought the Sword-reading Liquid here and sold it outside the Sword Wall. Fergus had set the price of the Sword-reading Liquid at twenty thousand divine crystals, without any discount, so the resellers made small profits.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng began selling the Sword-reading Liquid at a much lower price, Fergus' business had gone down. The resellers could make much higher profits if they bought from Zheng and then sold it outside the wall.</p>

  <p>Because of this, many well-informed people had begun to purchase the Sword-reading Liquid from Zheng. To ensure they continued to earn handsomely, they kept these dealings a secret.</p>

  <p>Thanks to that, Zheng had been selling for a few months before Fergus got word of it.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood poised in front of the shop and glanced over it unimpressed.</p>

  <p>Nothing here gave him any cause for the fear he was told he should have.</p>

  <p>As an Alliance Chief, Fergus didn't manage the shop himself. He had sent three Flag Masters to help him take care of it. One of them now lazed behind the counter.</p>

  <p>When he saw Zheng and the others marching on the store, he knew exactly who they were and why they had come.</p>

  <p>He and the other two Flag Masters had taught the group a little lesson.</p>

  <p>Fergus had ordered them not to kill anyone, or the group would not have survived.</p>

  <p>The Flag Master was curious about their arrival. He didn't think they would dare to come here. Surely they understood the danger they faced.</p>

  <p>Why had they come? Were they here to beg for mercy?</p>

  <p>"Hey, you..." Zheng had already made his move as soon as the Flag Master opened his mouth. He didn't even have time to finish his words.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Crash!</p>

  <p>Under the impact of the immense force, the shop which once covered an area of twenty to thirty feet collapsed from left to right with a monstrous bang, and turned into nothing more than a heap of debris.</p>

  <p>Everything inside was expensive, including over a hundred bottles of Sword-reading Liquid. The Sword-reading Liquid was worth many, many divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Fergus did not have the ability to make the Sword-reading Liquid as Zheng did. He would have to pay for all those bottles.</p>

  <p>He had just lost over a million divine crystals with his shop's collapse.</p>

  <p>The face of the Flag Master standing in the ruins turned pale. He hadn't been prepared for Zheng to actually take action, believing that Zheng did not possess the strength to do it.</p>

  <p>Even now, he was still more afraid of how Fergus would react than of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You bastard, don't blame me for what happens next!" The Flag Master gritted his teeth and grimaced as if he was going to eat Zheng alive.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored him and turned back to ask, "Did he beat you today?"</p>

  <p>Kenelm nodded in confirmation.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around, with the Snow Sword in hand. At the same time, in a terrifying tone he said, "Today, you have only done one thing right. And it's a cause for celebration."</p>

  <p>With that, the Snow Sword shone, and the icy white gleam spread, like thousands of snowflakes engulfing the world.</p>
