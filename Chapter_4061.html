<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4061 The Obsession Of Birds </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Purr..."</p>

  <p>The white mist billowed ominously.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a humanoid figure emerged from the white mist.</p>

  <p>It had long curly hair and a handsome face. It was Maynard, one of the personal disciples of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? I don't understand," he said with a wild smile.</p>

  <p>The Snake Master sneered. In his eyes, the Element Spirit Civilization was like dregs. How much more these humans?</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The little white snake's eyes glowed a fierce green again.</p>

  <p>"So scary!"</p>

  <p>Maynard mocked as he ducked into the white mist.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>A large amount of white mist that was formed from the Void Dust turned into green powder and fell into the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>The green radiance the Snake Master could shoot from his eyes contained immeasurable power. It was able to destroy the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Grandmaster of Heaven emerged from the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>"You go to hell too!"</p>

  <p>The little white snake's eyes glowed green once more, as he aimed at the head of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven calmly raised one hand. Before the green radiance reached him, a hand emerged from the mist just in time to block the attack.</p>

  <p>"Calm down," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>Then, he took out a thin, sharp tooth and abruptly sliced off one of his hands.</p>

  <p>Not a drop of blood was shed, even though he severed his arm!</p>

  <p>The broken part quickly healed, and the bones and skin of the hand began to morph. Soon, the broken hand transformed into the shape of a bird.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! The bird flapped his wings urgently as he flew towards the shore.</p>

  <p>As he flew, the bird let out a series of rhythmic chirps, speaking in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred chaotic eras ago, you didn't even pay us any heed. Now you threaten us?" the bird taunted.</p>

  <p>The Snake Master squinted at the bird in the sky. "You are the stupidest in the world!" he shouted angrily. "That stupid bird's obsession is meaningless.</p>

  <p>Why do you still follow him?"</p>

  <p>Just like what the bird said, the Snake Masters didn't take the birds seriously in the beginning.</p>

  <p>Over several hundred chaotic eras, they went about their own business as the birds evolved and grew in strength. Later, the birds chose to support the Nihility race, which was not weaker than the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters were still considered quite powerful in the Jade Pure Realm. In fact, they could even be considered the mainstay of the Four Spirits Sect. This was because, in addition to the Snake Spirit Sect, they also had the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect under their control.</p>

  <p>They represented the orthodox of the Four Spirits Sect. They were also looked up to as somewhat of guardian angels to the sects under them, and also the sole hope for them to stay in this tiny place.</p>

  <p>However, all the birds practically worshiped the one stupid bird that could never wake up. The birds had evolved so much that they were strong enough to set an imbalance to the norm.</p>

  <p>The bird flapped his wings hurriedly, as though he was struggling to stay that high in the air.</p>

  <p>He looked down coldly at the Snake Master below. "Our master's obsession is what makes our lives meaningful. You can question us underlings, but don't you dare insult our master!"</p>

  <p>"Stupid bird! He's the stupidest leader of the Four Spirits Sect!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Master's curse infuriated the bird. Narrowing his beady little eyes at the Snake Master below, he said, "You aren't afraid of death.</p>

  <p>Instead, you are afraid of staying alive!</p>

  <p>If you dare insult our sect leader again, we will make sure you live forever!"</p>

  <p>The threat hit home.</p>

  <p>The little white snake shut up immediately, his thin lips trembling slightly.</p>

  <p>He was a Treacherous Being, after all.</p>

  <p>In a secondary world such as the chaos, he was immortal.</p>

  <p>If he died, he would simply come back to life at a specific spot.</p>

  <p>For example, the coordinates of the world builders were on the Whining Road. No matter where they were killed, they would be reborn on the Whining Road, because the Treacherous Beings' coordinates were set there.</p>

  <p>The Snake Master was the representative of the Snake Spirit Sect. He was responsible for communicating with the Element Spirit Civilization. He had two revival coordinates: one in the Jade Pure Realm, and the other in the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to move freely between the two coordinates, he only needed to die.</p>

  <p>If the bird was able to catch and imprison the Snake Master to make him always alive, this would prove very troublesome.</p>

  <p>The communication channel between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Snake Masters would be temporarily cut off, which was something he couldn't risk.</p>

  <p>But it was not easy to capture the Snake Master.</p>

  <p>The bird's words managed to shut the irascible snake master up. As the Snake Master realized that he was in a dangerous situation, he suddenly twisted his body into a white light and rushed into the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The sickening sound of burning flesh rang through the Amber Cave as the little white snake resigned himself to the Void Dust. The Void Dust could erode everything, including the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the little white snake was completely devoured without a trace.</p>

  <p>The bird, after witnessing what just happened, swerved and flew back to the Grandmaster of Heaven in the mist.</p>

  <p>"What if you really kept the Snake Master here just now?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked playfully.</p>

  <p>The bird thought for a while and said, "He still would've found a way to end his own life, but it might've taken longer."</p>

  <p>"Right..." the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered as his eyes flashed. "He behaved a little strangely just now, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that the Grandmaster of Heaven had come into contact with this irascible Snake Master.</p>

  <p>Among the many Snake Masters, this one was the most aggressive.</p>

  <p>It was uncharacteristic of him to run away from conflict. Just now, the bird just threatened him, but he quickly decided to kill himself.</p>

  <p>It was likely that this Snake Master had a very important task to fulfill.</p>

  <p>The bird knew what the Grandmaster of Heaven was thinking. "The battle in the Jade Pure Realm is very fierce. I'm afraid they will soon occupy the Mist City again. So, he must've been in a hurry to go back."</p>

  <p>"They must have lost miserably in the battle of the Wine Basin. I'm afraid they won't make a concession this time," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, scratching his chin.</p>

  <p>"Right," the bird said. "We need to hurry. Destroy your body and hatch the third egg."</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect had given the Grandmaster of Heaven three bodies, each one stronger than the last.</p>

  <p>The first body was killed by Zheng, so that was out of the picture already.</p>

  <p>The second body should've been able to last longer.</p>

  <p>However, things went much faster than the birds had expected. They wanted to give the Grandmaster of Heaven more power, so they had to destroy the second body and use the third one.</p>

  <p>"Then, let's start now." The Grandmaster of Heaven nodded and gave a few orders to Maynard before taking action.</p>

  <p id="top_13">While the plan was in motion, Maynard was tasked with guarding the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>After giving instructions to Maynard, the Grandmaster of Heaven willingly submitted himself to the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Once more, the sickening sizzling sound of melting flesh rang throughout the Amber Cave as the Grandmaster of Heaven's body melted as the mist devoured his flesh.</p>

  <p>The Void Dust was actually a convenient tool to take one's life, if need be.</p>

  <p>This was why both the Snake Master just now and the Grandmaster of Heaven submitted themselves to it.</p>

  <p>The bird then started to flap his wings and he flew through the white mist.</p>

  <p>He didn't stop flying until he had reached the deepest part of the Amber Cave, where he landed on a huge egg.</p>

  <p>Standing on the egg, he bent over and gently pecked at the egg with his orange, fluffy beak.</p>

  <p>Tiny and complex hairline cracks began to appear on the surface of the egg, and a powerful aura of life began to emanate from it.</p>

  <p>As the egg began to hatch, the bird watched. There was a hint of helplessness in his small, beady eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Nihility Way was a path of no return.</p>

  <p>But this was the only way, according to their sect leader.</p>

  <p>Every bird in the Bird Spirit Sect was extremely loyal and would never betray their sect, even if it meant flying straight to their death.</p>

  <p>In a sense, they were trying to realize their sect leader's "last wish", but at what cost?</p>
