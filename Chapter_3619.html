<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman's face was contorted in agony. Still, she made no sound.</p>

  <p>This was a punishment she was willing to bear.</p>

  <p>There were surely more severe punishments waiting for her in the higher stage.</p>

  <p>The golden snake tightened its grip on her. "You don't have to return for the time being."</p>

  <p>"Why?" the woman had to ask, through the pain.</p>

  <p>She had been convinced the golden snake would ask her to get that Civilization Artifact back.</p>

  <p>Not that she could. She would be facing the two strongest fighters in Stage Seventeen whom she was no match for. That man must have already gotten the Civilization Artifact. How could she snatch it from him?</p>

  <p>"Go to the lower stages and find a human called the Evil God. He is a Soul of Light," the golden snake said.</p>

  <p>The woman gritted her teeth at this. Her strength diminished with every lower stage she would cross. It was a slow torture.</p>

  <p>The pain she felt now would only be heightened in the lower stages.</p>

  <p>Every fiber of her being screamed in refusal, but she knew she had no choice. "What do you need a Soul of Light for?"</p>

  <p>She had nothing but scorn for her fellow humans in the Source World. In her eyes, they were just failed clones of the 77th civilization.</p>

  <p>"Lead him into the Chilling Bone Land," the golden snake instructed.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The woman was taken aback.</p>

  <p>Every civilization and every large race had secrets hidden on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race, the Nihility race, and even the human race all had their secrets. The Chilling Bone Land was one of those.</p>

  <p>"A Soul of Light in the Chilling Bone Land?" the woman asked, hesitantly.</p>

  <p>Even she was not qualified to cultivate in the Chilling Bone Land. How would some unknown human be able to enter it so easily?</p>

  <p>"Do as I said. Find him as soon as possible. Failure is not an option.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, you know what awaits you!"</p>

  <p>The woman's blood froze at the golden snake's threat.</p>

  <p>With those words, the golden light in the snake's eyes dimmed. It loosened its grip on the woman's body.</p>

  <p>Finally able to catch her breath, the woman frowned as she mulled over the latest orders given to her. She took one last look at the Extremity Mice around before entering another small cave.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the midlands of Stage Seventeen, Luo Zheng hid Feng Ge's physical body for safety before they retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Instead of walking out of the cultivation room, he began to fuse with the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent slowly spread out, and the book slowly descended in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven flew out of the book and hovered high in the sky.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows knitted together as he looked down.</p>

  <p>"Why is this inner world a primitive land?" Another figure floated out of the book. It was Zhurong, one of the 39 statues.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The energy souls rushed out of the book one after another, taking in their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Like the Primeval Lord of Heaven, they were puzzled at the state of Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>They had never heard of an inner world turning into a primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! How was this guy able to do this?" Fuxi asked as he scanned the landscape.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess next to him shook her head. She fixed her gaze on the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "This primitive land is..."</p>

  <p>"We have to fight for the Source World," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly pronounced, interrupting the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng overheard the conversation clearly, his manifestation floating near the others. So they still wanted to do battle for the Source World.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng absorbed the implication of these words, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned to look at him. "Why is your inner world like this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't need to hide anything. With a sheepish smile, he briefly explained the Primal Chaos Technique and his master Bromley.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had also been perplexed when he first saw this primitive land.</p>

  <p>He knew well of the primitive land, but it had been his first time to actually see an inner world like it.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned over what Luo Zheng said in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had an idea what this primitive land meant, but he was uncertain. In the end, he waved the thought away. He looked at Luo Zheng steadily. "Carry the book and we will help you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hesitate to do so. It was easy to carry the book under the protection of the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Chains wrapped around the book. It was thus ready to be borne.</p>

  <p>The three Civilization Artifacts now hovered side by side, emitting an indescribable aura.</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure floated up toward the assembly. It was Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian greeted his father with a smile before continuing toward the artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>A mechanical voice piped up from the artifact. "The earth-level third-class task: occupy and expand the Crimson Divine Kingdom..."</p>

  <p>"Task accepted!" Luo Nian responded promptly.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a beam of light, the Civilization Artifact designated the task to Luo Nian. With this accomplished, Luo Nian cupped his hands and bowed to Luo Zheng before flying away excitedly.</p>

  <p>All this time, Luo Zheng hadn't paid much attention to his inner world. He closed his eyes now and focused. All memories of Luo Nian's activities in his inner world flashed across his mind.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he realized Luo Nian was undergoing cultivation in a special way.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had taken the Regal Jade Spirit as his teacher and had been working very hard to cultivate in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>However, he had yet to reach the Other Shore Realm in this way. The body-refining cultivation method the Regal Jade Spirit taught him was exceptionally mysterious. The warriors below the consummation of True God Realm might be no match for him, but he was still much weaker than the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had chanced upon the cubic object floating in the sky one day, and discovered that it had been issuing tasks nonstop.</p>

  <p>Some of the tasks sounded inconceivable, far beyond what Luo Nian could do.</p>

  <p>Some tasks, however, were simple and could be completed in the inner world. Luo Nian had accepted one of the tasks and completed it. To his amazement, the cubic object actually improved the power of his physical body as a reward!</p>

  <p>Luo Nian took advantage of this easy method to improve.</p>

  <p>All this time, he had been receiving the tasks released by the Civilization Artifact almost every day and night. With the completion of each task, his physical body and strength became more and more powerful. He now could release 30 Jun of force.</p>

  <p>This amount of power was just normal for Luo Zheng, of course.</p>

  <p>But it was enough to qualify Luo Nian to become a Flag Master in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian hadn't even stepped into the Sea of Truth yet.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other energy souls sized up the other two Civilization Artifacts.</p>

  <p>Every Civilization Artifact represented the civilization behind it. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been raring to meet the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>But they soon found they couldn't communicate with the Heavenly Obsession Civilization at all.</p>
