  <p>The grey dot of light continued to fly ahead at an excessively fast speed, but no one still had any idea what it was--not even after Supreme Lord Alyx had died.</p>

  <p>All they saw was a trail of grey that was left by the grey dot of light.</p>

  <p>However, the grey light circled around once and landed on Marko's shoulder after it had killed Supreme Lord Alyx.</p>

  <p>Only then did realization dawn upon Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the rest of them. That grey dot of light wasn't light.</p>

  <p>It was a bat, but it was also a soul body. However, this soul was at the level of True God Soul, not the level of Gold Fighting Soul. The bat was well-known in the divine land as it was the fastest true spirit--the Flash Bat.</p>

  <p>The bat, when with its body, could move at insanely fast speeds, but with just a soul, it was even faster than what was possible. It was no surprise that warriors who practiced evil cultivation methods to refine their souls viewed it as a sacred treasure.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, true spirits in the divine land were rare. It was extremely hard to catch a Flash Bat. Besides, if ordinary True Gods came across one, they would feel lucky if they were not killed by it, let alone catch it.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Marko didn't catch the bat himself as he couldn't do so. The Soul Searching Flag was originally a treasure that Murphy had used before. It was powerful not because of its flag, but rather the souls that were imprisoned within the flag.</p>

  <p>"Are you full?" Marko turned to the bat.</p>

  <p>He extended his finger and gently caressed the small creature on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The little bat just nudged his finger with a weak noise.</p>

  <p>"You are still hungry? Then continue eating."</p>

  <p>Marko had originally planned to collect a few more Gold Fighting Souls for the Soul Searching Flag, but since he had taken the Flash Bat out, he had to let it eat to its heart's content.</p>

  <p>The moment he gave the Flash Bat permission, it whirled into a greyish blur before it sped away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the others were already on full alert. However, they didn't have the chance to react when they saw the Flash Bat charge towards them. All they saw was a grey streak of light, then nothing.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords looked around in search for the bat. Supreme Lord Jamal looked down and finally saw the bat's grey colored trail. "Down there," he muttered. As soon as he finished speaking and before the sound could spread further, the Flash Bat from below flew straight towards his body and came out from the top of his skull.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment turned his head and saw a line of grey shoot out from Supreme Lord Jamal's head. Then, Supreme Lord Jamal's senses faded. His eyes began to dim as his entire body silently plummeted downwards.</p>

  <p>While Supreme Lord Jamal's body wasn't damaged, the Flash Bat had devoured his soul.</p>

  <p>"Get close to me!" Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment shouted.</p>

  <p>He promptly ordered Shay and Jace to gather around him. As the three Supreme Lords gathered together, red light flashed from the spot between Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment's eye brows. The Blood Refinement True Thunder shot out.</p>

  <p>The Blood Refinement True Thunder turned into a lightning cover which spread out. Countless bolts of blood-red lightning formed a web and protected the three Supreme Lords inside it.</p>

  <p>The small bat was only the size of a palm. Generally speaking, creatures that relied on their speed to win were considered quite weak. Thus, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment assumed that the Flash Bat wouldn't be able to penetrate the lightning cover formed by the Blood Refinement True Thunder.</p>

  <p>And just like what Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment had predicted, the Flash Bat soared into the sky. It had reached the peak of the Evolutionary Universe in just a few seconds, then it went back and swooped down towards Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the others.</p>

  <p>The tiny Flash Bat charged towards Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment's head, but it suddenly flew in another direction. It was indeed wary of the Blood Refinement True Thunder!</p>

  <p>The grey creature continued to circle around the blood-red ball of lightning. It went extremely close to the lightning cover several times and even attracted a few bolts of Blood Refinement True Thunder, but it quickly broke free with its fast speed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Supreme Lord Shay and Supreme Lord Jace chattered away as they stared at the spiraling grey trail.</p>

  <p>"That thing didn't dare come in!"</p>

  <p>"A single Blood Refinement True Thunder can wipe it out?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment remained silent. The Blood Refinement True Thunder was the Heavenly Destiny that was activated by burning one's blood essence. Although he was a Supreme Lord and had a rich amount of blood energy in his body that was far more than that of an ordinary warrior, his blood essence was not infinite.</p>

  <p>The Blood Refinement True Thunder required copious amounts of blood essence. In just half a minute, it had already consumed more than half of his blood essence.</p>

  <p>As for Marko, he held the Soul Searching Flag in his hand and calmly stared at the three Supreme Lords who hid behind the lighting cover. He looked indifferent, bored even. He knew that their struggle was meaningless; the little bat could only rely on its fast speed and just a single Blood Refinement True Thunder was enough to kill it. The problem was, no one in the universe could ever catch it.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Flash Bat could use the Soul Realm Refraction technique. The protective refracted light could enable the bat to break through the lightning cover by force.</p>

  <p>Marko's Flash Bat liked to devour the souls that struggled in pain. Once it had tormented its prey long enough, then that was when it would take action.</p>

  <p>After a while, all of Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment's blood essence had been completely exhausted.</p>

  <p>Just then, a slight sizzling noise was heard.</p>

  <p>It was a sign that the Blood Refinement True Thunder began to wear off as well.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment had to maintain the Blood Refinement True Thunder and to do so, he began to burn ordinary blood.</p>

  <p>It was extremely fatal if a mortal lost a third of their blood.</p>

  <p>For a Supreme Lord, they could replenish their blood in a short amount of time if they burned all of it. As long as they could replace it in time, there wouldn't be much of a problem.</p>

  <p>The blood of Supreme Lords was extremely condensed and refined, but it burned faster than blood essence when used to maintain the Blood Refinement True Thunder. In this case, it would be inevitable for Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment to drain his body of blood to the last drop if he continued.</p>

  <p>"I'll go all out!"</p>

  <p>Yet, he was no longer confident as he said his words. He had been completely drained of his blood essence, and he knew that he no longer had anything to rely on for him to go all out.</p>

  <p>As the lightning cover slowly dissipated, Marko gently waved his hand.</p>

  <p>A grey arc shot out from it and pierced through the heads of Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and Supreme Lord Jace. Naturally, the two of them had died. It was worth noting that Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment was the first top-rank Supreme Lord that had ever died.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shay on the other hand, had used the Grand Teleportation technique at the very last moment to escape.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was only able to travel across a single supreme world and just as he was about to execute the Grand Teleportation technique to flee further, the Flash Bat had already caught up to him and pierced through his head as well.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the Flash Bat returned and landed on Marko's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Alright, there are still many Gold Fighting Souls in this Evolutionary Universe. They are all your food," Marko said as he held the Soul Searching Flag. Then, he looked towards the other Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The Flash Bat flipped its wings in excitement. It made a shrill, loud noise on Marko's shoulder. The worst was yet to come.</p>

  <p>As the two True Gods joined the battle of the Supreme Lords, the tables had been turned.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe previously had the upper hand, but now they began to lose their ground. More and more of their Supreme Lords continued to die.</p>

  <p>With Marko's and Pranav's help, they were able to turn the war to the Sacred race's favor. Now, the Evolutionary Universe was the one in imminent danger.</p>

  <p>The situation on the True Path was a little different.</p>

  <p>Dark and Light energies constantly condensed into Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>The martial artists on the True Path were very similar in appearance to the Sacred martial artists of the Murphy Universe, so much that there was hardly any difference between the two.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng knew the fundamental difference between the two.</p>

  <p>If the Sacred martial artists in the Murphy Universe were formed from Murphy's life vitality, the real Sacred martial artists seemed to be formed from Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Dark and Light energies were formed from the chaotic energy. In that case, who had turned the chaotic energy into Dark and Light energies?</p>

  <p>The creatures in Luo Zheng's inner world had been directly formed from the chaotic energy and didn't undergo the process of Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, almost all of the Sacred martial artists that Luo Luo Zheng had fought were at the cultivation level of a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng faced the continuous onslaught of the Sacred warriors head-on and did not hold back in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Puff puff puff!"</p>

  <p>A huge chunk of the Sacred world lords were torn apart and killed. Their bodies dissolved into Dark and Light energies that disappeared on the True Path.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had consumed more than 90% of the nine stars' strength source, he had relied on the chaotic energy ever since he had entered the Immortal Mansion. He had continuously transformed it into his strength to increase his power.</p>

  <p>Only ten percent of his power was more than enough to kill the Sacred world lords.</p>

  <p>After an hour of slaughter, Luo Luo Zheng had finally killed all of the Sacred race's world lords.</p>

  <p>He looked at the mountains of bodies around him and sighed. "Have I passed?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>He currently wasn't in the mood to hone his skills on the True Path. He simply wanted to pass through it and obtain the heaven token as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>As the Sacred world lords disappeared, the Dark and Light energies swirled again and formed two huge black and white vortexes on both sides of the road. The vortexes repeatedly gathered Dark and Light energies and turned into two ragged Sacred world lords.</p>

  <p>"The final challenge will still be fighting two Sacred world lords?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered. He was slightly baffled, but he thought it was a good thing.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Saul's voice rang in his ears once more and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, you must be careful. They are cultivators from remote ages."</p>
