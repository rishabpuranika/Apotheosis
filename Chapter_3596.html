<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Suspicion grew within Luo Zheng as he stood still, analyzing the bite mark on his arm.</p>

  <p>It wasn't painful or itchy. It just looked like a harmless gray tattoo.</p>

  <p>The dog landed and almost immediately rushed at him again with blinding speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaned back and tried to dodge again, but failed and was bitten on the neck!</p>

  <p>There was now a bite mark on his neck as well, neither painful nor itchy.</p>

  <p>After being bitten twice, Luo Zheng unleashed a burst of strength from his legs and retreated to Feng Ge's side.</p>

  <p>The dog shadow pulled the black wick straight, roaring at Luo Zheng non-stop.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge grabbed Luo Zheng's arm and looked at the gray bite mark.</p>

  <p>"It will probably be fine, but I'm afraid these bite marks are not that simple," Luo Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>He had no fear of these vicious beasts tied to the lamp stands attacking him head on. With the suppressive force of Stage Seventeen present, the creatures in this stage wouldn't be too powerful. He believed he would be able to withstand anything thrown at him.</p>

  <p>But these bite marks had given him cause for pause.</p>

  <p>"Then... it'd be better to not go in, right?" asked Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>She didn't know what was going on with the temple. She thought that if it was too dangerous, they should just give up.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng replied firmly.</p>

  <p>His determination left Feng Ge not knowing what to say next.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood motionless, surveying the lamp stands. As he did so, he asked,</p>

  <p>"No. 9527, Master Green Jade, do you have any knowledge of what this is?"</p>

  <p>It was naturally much easier for him to know the world considering he had two wise people within his body.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect such a strange place to exist in Stage Seventeen. My master has never come into contact with this before," answered No. 9527.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had some memories of Stage Seventeen from its master, but its master had never come here.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit hesitated for a long while before replying, "This seems to be the Hidden Spirit Lamp. Although it has been a long time, and I've only seen it once, it's most likely what it is!"</p>

  <p>"What is the Hidden Spirit Lamp?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, having any sliver of information on it was valuable.</p>

  <p>"It's a kind of lamp in the Three Purities Stage. When the Wing King and I went to Stage Thirty-three, we saw one. The beasts tied to the lamps are called Hidden Beasts. The Cyan Grasshopper that explored the stage with us was attacked by a Hidden Beast, leaving a gray mark on its head."</p>

  <p>"What happened to it after that?" Luo Zheng asked, listening intently.</p>

  <p>Although it took place in Stage Thirty-three, it sounded very much like what they were going through.</p>

  <p>"The Cyan Grasshopper was around as strong as I was. When it was attacked by the Hidden Beast, nothing strange occurred. But once we had traveled some distance, its head suddenly exploded!" the Green Jade Spirit recalled.</p>

  <p>"It's that deadly?" Luo Zheng asked with his eyebrows suddenly raised and his concern growing.</p>

  <p>All creatures of the Green Jade Civilization possessed extremely tough bodies. Not only that, the Cyan Grasshopper was a formidable master in the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm, said to be as powerful as a Chaos Ancient God. And yet, the Hidden Beast had killed it.</p>

  <p>A gloom fell over Luo Zheng as he stared at the gray mark on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's that deadly," the Green Jade Spirit nodded.</p>

  <p>"Were there others attacked by that Hidden Beast?" Luo Zheng followed up.</p>

  <p>"After the Hidden Beast launched an attack, the Wing King rushed to the lamp stand and extinguished the black flame on it. Once the black flame was extinguished, the Hidden Beast died," the Green Jade Spirit informed.</p>

  <p>The shadow's speed was so astonishing even Luo Zheng was unable to dodge it.</p>

  <p>One could not comprehend the speed of the Hidden Beast of Stage Thirty- three.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, speed was what the Wing King was best at. Putting out the black flame saved the lives of other creatures.</p>

  <p>"So putting out the black flame is the way to take care of these Hidden Beasts..." Luo Zheng stared at the nearest lamp stand. The dog ceased its roaring, but kept its focus trained on him.</p>

  <p>"It's not yet time to extinguish the black flame," the Green Jade Spirit said worriedly. "Try leaving this area first. The power of the gray bite mark may work and I'm not sure if you can withstand it, but you must try."</p>

  <p>The damage of the Hidden Beast was delayed. The Cyan Grasshopper was fine when it was bitten. It was only later that the damage showed itself and killed it. Luo Zheng was fine now, but what would happen later?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the suggestion of the Green Jade Spirit. "Follow me!" he exclaimed to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked, clueless to what Luo Zheng had just learned about the lamp stands.</p>

  <p>Without answering, Luo Zheng turned around and walked towards the gobi at the edge of the circle.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped into the gobi, the Hidden Spirit Lamps and the Hidden Beasts all disappeared.</p>

  <p>Then, at the same time, two powerful forces came at him, biting his arm and neck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well prepared for this. The Chaotic Source Spirits were activated and they withstood the biting forces.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was very close to Luo Zheng and could not help but scream when she felt the explosive power from the gray bite marks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body shook violently before the bite marks disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>He heaved a long sigh of relief and let out, "Fortunately, I can handle it..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked at him, bewildered, and asked, "What the hell was going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and explained the story of the Hidden Spirit Lamp and the Hidden Beast. On hearing this she said, "So if you're attacked too many times by those Hidden Beasts, they'll leave more and more gray marks which will surely kill you when they finally explode."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>That was why the Green Jade Spirit had asked him not to put the flame out yet. He wanted him to test the power of the dog's bite and see if he could handle it now and understand it more.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned to the desert, the dog crawling stood up once more, trying to pounce on him.</p>

  <p>The corner of Luo Zheng's mouth curled up slightly, and his legs suddenly jumped with unparalleled strength. He charged towards the lamp stand like a sharp darting arrow!</p>

  <p>"Wrrr!"</p>

  <p>The dog pounced at Luo Zheng as usual.</p>

  <p>But this time he had calculated the dog's trajectory. As he rushed forward, he suddenly lowered his body and somersaulted on the ground. He hit the lamp stand with a bang.</p>

  <p>It was extremely solid and almost unshakable, but his intention was not to smash it down.</p>

  <p>He jumped up and reached out to pinch the black flame.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>The moment the black flame was out, the shadow of the dog froze in the air and remained motionless. Now it was an immovable shadow.</p>
