<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't stupid to lock himself in with a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>But thanks to Saul's explanation, Luo Zheng understood that the Death Chain would be of great use. He could lock an opponent whose strength was on par with his so that he wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that the Death Chain was much more practical when compared to the Roaring Token. The decision was in his hands and he could decide whether or not he would use it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stuffed the Death Chain into his space ring, in no hurry to crush the remaining pieces. But he was anxious to figure out the cultivation method his master had just passed down to him.</p>

  <p>His master, who had created and named the cultivation method, had poured it into Zheng's mind. It was called the "Primal Chaos Technique."</p>

  <p>The name was rather simple; Luo Zheng suspected that his master was just too lazy to think of a suitable name.</p>

  <p>But the strength of warriors did not depend on their names. Likewise, the strength of a cultivation method was not something that could be determined by its name either.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a little worried when it came to cultivating this method. After all, his master had only deduced it, and he himself had never practiced it.</p>

  <p>But if a cultivation method could be obtained and cultivated by many people, it wouldn't be valuable enough and Luo Zheng wouldn't take a fancy to it.</p>

  <p>This cultivation method was different— no one had cultivated it before.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng started on this path, it would be one that no one had ever walked before. Who knew what he would find at the end?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed the method recorded in the manual and slowly condensed the life vitality in his belly. The wisp of chaotic energy that had disappeared, jumped back to life and whirred in his belly. It was at this moment that he finally understood what pain was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paled the instant the pain began shooting through his body. He was rooted to the spot, unable to move. Even his instinct to howl had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Ning Yudie asked nervously. When the three women saw that Luo Zheng seemed to have obtained some sort of inheritance after entering the book, they had become happy. But they became worried at the way he had paled so suddenly.</p>

  <p>The pain originated from his cinnabar field, as if something was grinding his belly without stop. The cinnabar field was the most sensitive yet most important part of a warrior. The pain spread and stimulated every nerve in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning rushed forward and asked nervously, "Luo Zheng, are you feeling alright?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng barely had the time to answer before his eyes rolled back and he fainted.</p>

  <p>He hoped that he would remain unconscious because he knew that if he woke up, it would be nothing less than hell's torment for him.</p>

  <p>The three women surrounded Luo Zheng, anxious at his state.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! What's wrong with you!"</p>

  <p>"Why did he pass out?"</p>

  <p>They all started to cry.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book glanced at Luo Zheng before saying, "Don't worry. He isn't hurt.</p>

  <p>It's just too painful."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stirred after a while, but the pain was like a shadow that followed him into consciousness. He let out a howl as his eyes rolled back and he fainted again.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Zheng's willpower was lacking; it was just that the pain had already far surpassed the limit that a human could endure. A warrior's cinnabar field was usually filled with pure life vitality. So how could it tolerate a foreign object?</p>

  <p>Due to the excruciating pain, Zheng's body had activated its self-protection mechanism, causing him to faint.</p>

  <p>The three women were speechless and worried for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They had no idea what was happening to him, or why he was suffering so much.</p>

  <p>After a long time, Luo Zheng woke up once again. He was still unable to speak, but the duration for which he woke up this time was much longer than the second time he had regained consciousness. The second time, he had only lasted three seconds, and the third time around, he had endured about fifteen seconds before fainting again.</p>

  <p>When he woke up the fourth time, Luo Zheng held on for about a minute, wailing and groaning as he did so.</p>

  <p>The fifth time, he persevered for about two minutes.</p>

  <p>The sixth time, about three minutes.</p>

  <p>The seventh time, about five minutes.</p>

  <p>The eighth time...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng repeatedly fainted and woke up. He was not used to this kind of pain. It was not something that humans could adapt to. It was just that his willpower to endure it was rapidly increasing.</p>

  <p>After the tenth time, his lips trembled, and he finally spoke. "We will be taking our leave first. Let's talk about it after we return to the Central Region." Then, he fainted once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the token of mountain, which meant that he could return to the fairy palace any time he wanted. But he didn't have much time to think right now. Moreover, it would be very difficult to focus under extreme pain. He would have to wait until he returned to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had said so, the three women would naturally bring him back to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>This time, Ning Yudie gently clapped her hands and took out the flood dragon puppet that she and Luo Zheng had obtained together.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng woke up once again. After bidding farewell to Saul and Immortal Book, he rode the flood dragon puppet with the three women and left the fairy palace. They returned to the Eastern Region and exited the Cloudy Mountain, flying into the sky.</p>

  <p>The valley in the Cloudy Mountain was called Dragon Valley because there were rumors that a dragon lived in there.</p>

  <p>Many people in G County watched as the flood dragon puppet left the Cloudy Mountain. They were now convinced that there was indeed a dragon in the mountain.</p>

  <p>It had to be worshiped since it was a dragon's nest. They believed that if anyone provoked the dragon, it would most probably punish all living beings. Therefore, a few large clans in G County had issued a prohibition, preventing anyone from approaching the Cloudy Mountain.</p>

  <p>As they nestled within the body of the flood dragon puppet, Luo Zheng fainted and recovered continuously. He remained unconscious for a longer period of time than he stayed awake. He would be awake for five to ten minutes, but would be unconscious for several hours.</p>

  <p>It took Ning Yudie a few days to bring the flood dragon puppet back to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>She instructed people to prepare a private residence for Mu Ning, after which she stayed with Luo Zheng to take care of him.</p>

  <p>Three months had passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>These three months saw Luo Zheng constantly passing out and waking up. This would be sheer torture to anyone and Luo Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>This pain had persisted for too long, and had even caused Zheng's mentality to change. He was extremely regretful. If he had known that it would be so painful, he wouldn't have practiced this cultivation method no matter what.</p>

  <p>It was not that Zheng's willpower was weak. He was not almighty. Even if his warrior spirit and willpower were stronger than those of ordinary warriors, this kind of pain was not something that any living being could endure. And Luo Zheng couldn't bear it either. Or maybe he could if he were a rock.</p>

  <p>How could the three women even smile when they saw the pain that Luo Zheng was in?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie fiercely guarded the Ice Palace. She let Saint Morphens take care of other matters that cropped up in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the time that Luo Zheng remained conscious became longer and longer. This kind of pain did not numb the body. Every time a wave of pain rippled through him, it made him feel like his head was about to explode. He would rather not wake up than endure this.</p>

  <p>One day, Luo Zheng slowly came to consciousness, and the moment he woke up, he knew that he would have to spend a few more hours in torment.</p>

  <p>But he could hear a melodious sound wafting in. Mu Ning was caressing the strings of her zither, just outside the Ice Palace. The music was so beautiful that it made Luo Zheng feel at ease.</p>

  <p>Even though the music could not suppress the pain, Luo Zheng still felt slightly better. He struggled to get up, while Ning Yudie, who had been waiting by his side for a countless number of days, immediately went up to support him. "Be careful," she said softly.</p>

  <p>But as he rose, Luo Zheng suddenly discovered that the pain in his cinnabar field had disappeared. The torment that had lasted for almost half a year had suddenly disappeared!</p>
