<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole chaos, the low-level power would be suppressed by the high-level power.</p>

  <p>Those who had been known to hold the supreme power were the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>So, when the Strength Equalizing Theurgy was activated, it had the power to suppress everything.</p>

  <p>The exiles took pride in their own strength and were powerful, but they were not much stronger than the mortals now. Even the power they had obtained from the Other Shore couldn't contend against the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it was not the same case for Zheng. His bloodline theurgy was also a truth theurgy, which could avoid the suppression of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Zheng finally understood what No. 9527 meant after the Strength Equalizing Theurgy was activated.</p>

  <p>Although his bloodline theurgy didn't contain much power, the power was at the high level.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>An extremely slight chirp resounded from Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>A trace of green light eventually appeared and danced gently on his palm. This green light slowly bounced up and quickly turned into a small green cube.</p>

  <p>For now, he had no idea what kind of ability was hidden in the blood's truth theurgy. With the guidance of No. 9527, he could make use of the theurgy— Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>He flipped his palm slightly, and the small green cube slowly spread out merging into his palm. His entire palm suddenly was completely dyed green. His gaze then looked at a distance as his fingers slightly clenched.</p>

  <p>The green light in his hand had already dissipated before he employed the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to attract too much noise.</p>

  <p>Since the Warden race had activated the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, there must be some other means. Before the Warden race used those methods, Zheng wouldn't easily expose his own means.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Right now, the exiles and Wild Gods were still in deep sleep engrossed in their own dreams, and some were even snoring.</p>

  <p>They hadn't slept so soundly for a long time.</p>

  <p>After a peaceful time of rest, ten hours had already passed.</p>

  <p>Emily was the first one to wake up. Perhaps due to a good sleep, she habitually became vigilant and almost reflexively jumped up.</p>

  <p>Not once in her thought that she would sleep soundly like this, such this was unimaginable in the past.</p>

  <p>When Emily saw that Zheng was still up and on guard, she let out a sigh of relief and asked, "How long has it been?"</p>

  <p>"About ten hours," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I didn't expect that I would fall asleep for so long." Emily looked at the exiles who were sleeping randomly. She forced a smile and said, "It seems that everyone is like this."</p>

  <p>Everyone's strength and ability were almost the same, but there were still small differences.</p>

  <p>One difference was with Emily's recovery speed. Her speed in recovering was much faster, which helped her in waking up earlier than the rest.</p>

  <p>"Don't you need to rest?" Emily glanced at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleepy," Zheng answered as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>He originally thought that the reason he wasn't that tired compared to them was because he had consumed less physical energy. But the moment he activated the bloodline theurgy, he noticed that it sustained him more energy.</p>

  <p>Analyzing the situation, he found out that he could keep such a good state because of the blood of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Emily stared at Zheng with a surprised expression.</p>

  <p>When Timotheus brought over and introduced Zheng, it had subconsciously sparked a hint of curiosity to her.</p>

  <p>She saw that Zheng was just a True God. It was true that his talent had astonished her, but his strength was not something special in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She had led a group of people to break into this world, and never even noticed the young man. There was nothing special that he did after all.</p>

  <p>She had not expected that after the attack of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, Zheng's ability eventually had been displayed which had truly surprised her.</p>

  <p>After the exiles' strength had been equalized, they could still be stronger than the Wild Gods relying on their powerful resources. However, Zheng was only a True God.</p>

  <p>Emily's curiosity had grown as she continued to observe him.</p>

  <p>She took two steps forward and folded her dress stained with blood. She sat next to Zheng and asked, "You also seem to want to leave this world, right?"</p>

  <p>The exiles had longed to leave this place, but many of the Wild Gods were not willing to leave this place. After all, this was their hometown. If they left the massive wild bones, they would even find it extremely difficult to cultivate!</p>

  <p>Zheng sat still and looked at the huge platforms far away. He smiled faintly and said, "Of course."</p>

  <p>It had already been a few years when he left the divine land. Probably a lot had changed as he knew nothing about the current situation.</p>

  <p>He was deeply worried since the situation in the divine land was not really good when he left.</p>

  <p>Would his mother be captured by Nicholas? Would she die along with those Holy Beings?</p>

  <p>What about Yan, Xun and Yudie in the fairy palace? Zheng couldn't help but be concerned about those who were left behind, the people who were close to his heart.</p>

  <p>As soon as Emily brought up the question, his heart was once filled with worry and longing. A hint of sadness had appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It looks like there are important people in the ship," Emily uttered.</p>

  <p>Emily had already planned to gather all the power of the exiles from the Snake Goddess race and would forcefully pull down the ship.</p>

  <p>"Of course." Zheng nodded. "All of my family are there, and so are my enemies."</p>

  <p>Emily was well aware about the origin of the divine land and the grudge between Chiyou and the Yellow Emperor. However, after she was imprisoned in this prison, she did not know what happened to the Source World afterwards.</p>

  <p>She now knew that the Nine Li race had weakened and it even forced Chiyou to build a ship. The ship would then help their race flee from the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Your enemies must be Yellow Emperor's men, or namely the Yellow Emperor Guards, right?" Emily once again inquired.</p>

  <p>In this world, the Yellow Emperor race and the Snake Goddess race were considered to just be in simple states. Both races were complicated in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Everything that had happened was because of those Yellow Emperor Guards," Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards also supported Nicholas. Zheng never had an encounter with the Yellow Emperor Guards before, but the reason why the divine land would be reduced to its current level now was because of them.</p>

  <p>If he were to return to the divine land, he would face them sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"If we can leave this world, I will help you kill them all," Emily said with a smile.</p>

  <p>She wasn't clear about the strength of the Yellow Emperor Guards but she was confident in offering a helping hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to meddle in this matter?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never been to the Source World before, but he knew that the competition between these great races was full of various interests.</p>

  <p>If he could really leave this world, he naturally hoped that Timotheus, Ramzi, Leopold and the other strong warriors from the Nine Li race would come back to the divine land with him. He didn't expect that Emily would offer to stand by him.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Emily kept the smile on her face as her eyes flashed. "As long as I can leave this world..."</p>

  <p>With the current situation for the exiles, there would be no room for retreat.</p>
