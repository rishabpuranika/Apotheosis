<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3570 The Second Imperial Edict </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone present couldn't say anything, and they were all stunned in silence.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the second floor just stared blankly at Luo Zheng on the arena.</p>

  <p>At first, they simply wanted to have fun and let Rocco, the number one warrior on the second floor, teach him a lesson. Therefore, someone took the initiative to call Rocco over.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was extraordinarily talented, he had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>It was already a great miracle that he had defeated Cleon, and they believed he couldn't possibly fight Rocco back.</p>

  <p>However, he still fought head on. He didn't rely on his strong body alone but instead, he used both his body and strength to defeat Rocco in a face-to-face combat.</p>

  <p>After he had won that round, he jumped from being the number one on the first floor to the number one on the second floor, and subsequently passed all the disciples on the second floor.</p>

  <p>The deathly silence lasted for a long time. Finally, Yusuf who was on the second floor opened his mouth and said, "This is too crazy..." "He has directly become the number one on the second floor. My God!" Ronnie exclaimed with eyes as wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>"I've been on the second floor for several hundred years, but I haven't even made it to the top one hundred!" another disciple commented. "What's more is that he is only in the fourteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm," the fair-skinned man muttered.</p>

  <p>Overall, the competition on the second floor was much fiercer than it was on the first floor. There were only two hundred and three people competing, but it was extremely difficult to advance even just one place.</p>

  <p>Many people on the second floor had stayed there for countless years, and their names had remained in the same places on the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>It was certainly not an easy thing for them to improve their rankings.</p>

  <p>Chaim, who was watching under the arena, was also taken aback.</p>

  <p>As a new comer like Luo Zheng, he naturally paid attention to Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had unleashed more than eight thousand Jun of force in the Chaotic Source World, but that terrifying amount of power was way beyond what he could endure.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to use seven or eight thousand Jun of force without the help of the Inheritance of World, they would have to practice in the Chaotic Source Realm for many years. However, Luo Zheng had done such a thing so easily!</p>

  <p>His growth speed was simply too fast. If he continued at that rate, he would probably leave the Land of Sword Grief soon.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Rocco lay on the ground in pain. He stretched out his left hand to grab his right arm and gently twisted it. The broken bone in his arm quickly returned to its original position. After that, he continued to press on his chest, all the way to his right leg, until the bones on the right side of his body were corrected.</p>

  <p>After that, an Other Shore Token appeared above his head. The Other Shore Token spun around and a green light covered his head, which then instantly healed all the wounds on the right side of his body.</p>

  <p>Then he got up from the ground, took a look at Luo Zheng, and left.</p>

  <p>It was known that Rocco was an aloof and arrogant man. Thus, it was like a big joke to him to lose to the number one warrior on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Like the others, he was also quite confused, but it was obvious that Luo Zheng wouldn't ease his doubts. Therefore, he didn't want to stay any longer.</p>

  <p>Once he was gone, the disciples on the first floor released their uncontrollable excitement.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng won so easily!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! Especially when I know Rocco is simply an invincible existence?"</p>

  <p>"There are very few people who can make it to the third floor these years.</p>

  <p>Rocco should be the most promising one. I didn't expect that Luo Zheng would replace him?"</p>

  <p>The disciples on the first floor let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had been above all of them from the very first day, quite a number of disciples naturally felt ashamed. However, they felt a bit better when he had surpassed even the disciples on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Now, the powerful warriors on the third floor might be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>His name on the Ranking Stone on the first floor quietly disappeared and at the same time, everyone's rankings went up by one place. Even Cleon, who Luo Zheng had previously defeated, was no exception.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Cleon had mixed feelings about returning to the first place on the first floor in such a way. Still, he now understood that he truly couldn't fight against Luo Zheng. In just two months, their skills already differed greatly from each other.</p>

  <p>Cleon calmed down a little at this thought.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ranking Stone on the second floor showed that more than two hundred people had all dropped by one place, and Luo Zheng was ranked first. Therefore, Rocco had to give up his cultivation room on the second floor to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While all of those happened, the battle on the arena continued.</p>

  <p>In order to compete for the rankings at the beginning of each month, the battle would last for a few days. It also went without saying that the rankings on the Ranking Stone would change as well.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng came down from the arena, Dorothy immediately went up to him.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Luo Zheng. You've made it to the second floor so fast!" she said excitedly. "Are you going to challenge Li Bianxue and take the top ranking of the Land of Sword Grief next month?" Chaim asked with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Take the top ranking of the Land of Sword Grief?" Luo Zheng thought about it for a while, shook his head and smiled. "I can't do that in a month. You must be kidding," he chided.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the disciples on the third floor were almost on par with the likes of Qiu Yinhe. If they left the Land of Sword Grief, they would have the chance to become Taiyi Governors. Still, it would be difficult for Luo Zheng to fight them straight, even if he activated the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>It was simply too hard for him to do all of those in only a span of a month.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll give you two months!" Dorothy pursed her lips and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Can you give me more time?" Luo Zheng asked bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No." Dorothy shook her head, pretending to be serious. Just then, Feng Ge appeared beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She glanced coldly at Dorothy and said, "I just announced one imperial edict. In fact, my father has issued two imperial edicts."</p>

  <p>"What's the second imperial edict about?" Luo Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"My father wants to see you. Now follow me to the Phoenix Palace," she told him.</p>

  <p>'Eastern Emperor Taiyi wants to see me?' Luo Zheng thought, surprised.</p>

  <p>His mind subconsciously thought about the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his son had deciphered the Truth Enlightenment, but he hadn't completely comprehended it.</p>

  <p>If Eastern Emperor Taiyi urged him, he would only offer five hundred words at most.</p>

  <p>"Why does Eastern Emperor Taiyi want to see me?" In reality, he actually wanted to hesitate.</p>

  <p>"You'll know when you meet him."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge grabbed Luo Zheng's arm and pulled him away, leaving Dorothy stunned as she watched the two of them leave.</p>

  <p>As for Chaim, he was in deep thought. "Is Eastern Emperor Taiyi going to grant Luo Zheng a marriage?" he asked out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"What?" Obviously, Dorothy was shocked!</p>

  <p>When Chaim saw how Dorothy looked, he immediately realized that he had said something wrong. "It's not necessarily true. It's probably because of what happened within Stage Fourteen," he said hastily.</p>

  <p>Although Chaim tried to explain, Dorothy was already at a loss.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had already fallen in love with Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng had made a name for himself. Eastern Emperor Taiyi might really grant him a marriage.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was too reserved when it came to relationships. Now, she felt a greater sense of anxiety.</p>

  <p>Her lips curved into a deep frown and she swam in her thoughts for a long time. After a while, it seemed that she had finally made a difficult decision.</p>

  <p>She left the Land of Sword Grief alone and headed straight for the Origin Mountain.</p>
