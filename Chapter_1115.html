<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Shall we continue?" Luo Zheng once again asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>The little monster once again got up on his feet. After spitting on the ground, he looked up at Luo Zheng. There was a sinister smile contorting his lips. He did not say anything, and instead, once again leapt upwards towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng appeared behind the little monster. Since the power of five hundred dragon scales was not enough to hurt him, he planned to directly activate the power of eight hundred dragon scales. He hoped that would be enough.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng was about to attack, the little monster's hand suddenly twisted and came towards him.</p>

  <p>The whole scene was very confusing, but Luo Zheng quickly understood what was happening. The little monster's arm just twisted backwards to come for him!</p>

  <p>This action would be impossible for a human to complete. It was just like trying to turn one's neck 360 degrees. A normal person would suffer from broken bones if he or she attempted to do what this little monster had done.</p>

  <p>It was now clear that the little monster's body was extremely flexible.</p>

  <p>While contemplating this fact, Luo Zheng wasn't able to dodge the oncoming arm. It caught his arm, and its grip immediately tightened.</p>

  <p>Just like a rope, the arm coiled itself around Zheng's arm, effectively tying him down.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," the little monster chuckled, happiness evident on his face. "As I have told you, I don't need to use my life vitality just to deal with you."</p>

  <p>His vicious grin widened. Suddenly, a huge force flowed through his arm, and he sent Luo Zheng flying towards the ground!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Taken by surprise, Luo Zheng wasn't able to ready himself for the attack.</p>

  <p>Because of that, he had no choice but to brace himself for the impact.</p>

  <p>Within a fraction of a second, he crashed into the bottom of the enchanted barrier. However, the little monster's attack was not over. His arm was still tightly wrapped around Zheng's body -- it had stretched out to a length of over eighty feet!</p>

  <p>'This guy is really a monster!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself as he lay on the bottom of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Despite being entangled, he managed to prop himself up and give the little monster a good glare.</p>

  <p>Not wasting any time, the little monster's arm began to deform again, but now, the original eighty feet long arm was shrinking. With that, the little monster was able to close the distance between the two of them quickly, while his other fist was coming towards Zheng's head like a raging meteor!</p>

  <p>Despite his body being so soft, the power that had erupted from inside him was astonishing, and to think that he still hadn't used his life vitality!</p>

  <p>Right at this critical moment, Luo Zheng stopped thinking. He tilted his head and the little monster's fist had missed its target. The entire enchanted barrier started to shake under the little monster's enormous power.</p>

  <p>"These two fellows are both monsters," Marine, the Holy Maiden, mumbled as she watched the battle that was happening in the enchanted barrier. Her face was colored with fear, anger, and amusement.</p>

  <p>When she first asked this little monster to fight for her, she felt that Luo Zheng was destined to suffer a lot.</p>

  <p>In the four divine kingdoms where there were countless divine-level talents, the reason that this little monster stood out as a freak in the eyes of every other person was not because of his special talent, but because of his incomparable strength.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be a mutant among humans.</p>

  <p>When they first discovered the little monster, he was living in the forest where the warriors of Nine Furnace Martial House practiced.</p>

  <p>The practice was to enter the Seven Water Forest which was to the north of the York Divine Kingdom. That forest wasn't particularly dangerous, and the strongest fierce beasts there were only at the third or fourth level.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Nine Furnace Martial House would usually organize tens of thousands of warriors at the nature level to enter into the forest to practice.</p>

  <p>It was during that time that they encountered this little monster.</p>

  <p>When they came upon him, he didn't have a name, and no one knew where he came from. He didn't even know human language! He lived the same way as a fierce beast would -- eating raw meat, especially brains.</p>

  <p>Several hundreds of people from the Nine Furnace Martial House who entered the Seven Water Forest were killed by the little monster alone.</p>

  <p>Everyone died in a different way, but one thing was in common -- all of their heads had been smashed and their brains were sucked out clean!</p>

  <p>This news quickly spread throughout the Nine Furnace Martial House's senior leaders. It shook them up. Because of that, they decided to send over a thousand martial artists at the Internal Elixir Realm into the Seven Water Forest to investigate. It was only then did they finally discover the little monster. They had to chase after him for more than ten days before they were able to capture him.</p>

  <p>That year, the little monster was seven years old, and he only had the strength at the marrow refining level. No one had taught him any martial skills, and all of his cultivation had been achieved through his own comprehension.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Furnace Martial House captured him, they decided to spare his life. Even though he was dangerous, he only attacked ordinary nature creatures. The senior leaders of the Nine Furnace Martial House decided to keep him in order to unravel the secrets of his incredible body.</p>

  <p>They never expected that they would find out so much about the little monster's body. First and foremost, his bones seemed to be extremely soft and flexible.</p>

  <p>Once, someone cut off one of his arms as an experiment. A few days later, he grew another.</p>
