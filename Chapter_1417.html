<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dashed forward with the Heavenly Phoenix Horse as his mount.</p>

  <p>Only a month had passed since he had made the appointment with Lincoln, and five more months were there for Luo Zheng to do whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>He had met Freya through a chance encounter but she had helped him to collect life vitality jades in the mines.</p>

  <p>He wondered what kind of trouble she got into after they went their separate ways.</p>

  <p>Pondering this, he spurred the horse onward and left the trans-border channel. The soldiers guarding the passage sized up his horse and were immediately respectful towards him.</p>

  <p>Normally, it cost travelers a large amount of life vitality jade to use this passage, so Luo Zheng was about to pull out his Gauze Token, which would give him a free pass, but to his surprise, the soldiers permitted him through without asking for the toll.</p>

  <p>These soldiers were obviously smart. They knew that a warrior using a legendary beast as his mount was not someone they could afford to offend. If this distinguished visitor on the Heavenly Phoenix Horse had a bad temper, they would regret inconveniencing him. Therefore, no one dared to keep Luo Zheng even for a second.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng left the trans-border channel and entered the common teleportation channel, the soldiers stared after him and began to discuss in low voices.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! It's a Heavenly Phoenix Horse! Such a rare thing in a remote supreme world like ours!"</p>

  <p>"I bet that even the Saint Lord of our Spiritual Force Sacred Place doesn't have the ways and means of getting this horse. Who's this talented young man?"</p>

  <p>"Could he be the son of a world lord? He must be! There's no other explanation. But it's strange that he has no arrogance of a rich man.</p>

  <p>Instead, he seems like an easy-going man..."</p>

  <p>They didn't know that six months ago, Luo Zheng had just ascended from the Lower World. Back then, as a warrior from the Lower World, he was imprisoned in the mines of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place and had to collect life vitality jades to gain freedom.</p>

  <p>After leaving the teleportation channel, Luo Zheng returned to the land of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place only occupied ten to twenty percent of the Spirit Reading World's territory, but it was still very expansive.</p>

  <p>Outside the teleportation passage was a large city. Luo Zheng jumped down from the Heavenly Phoenix Horse and started to study at his surroundings. Hoping to find a person in the Upper World was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had exchanged message runes with Freya, but the one he gave her only worked at a distance of twenty thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Without thinking too much, he sent a message using the rune, "I've received your message, Freya. Where are you?"</p>

  <p>He waited for a while but didn't get any response.</p>

  <p>'She's still too far...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought and once again mounted his Heavenly Phoenix Horse. He gently patted the horse's neck and spurred it to soar towards the sky.</p>

  <p>He flew up and stayed within a radius of several hundred thousand miles.</p>

  <p>He kept altering his position and trying the message rune.</p>

  <p>He finally received a response on the sixth attempt.</p>

  <p>Freya's voice whispered into his ear.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! It's you! You've left the mines!" There was a hint of surprise in her voice.</p>

  <p>She had sent Luo Zheng the message through the rune merely in a desperate attempt to save herself. He hadn't chosen to leave the mines after accumulating 100 life vitality jades but instead he had remained in the mines to collect more jades. Freya, on the other hand, had only wanted to visit her uncle to seek shelter and thus, she opted to leave.</p>

  <p>This place was more than sixty thousand miles away from the mines.</p>

  <p>Freya didn't think that Luo Zheng would be able to receive her message even if he had left the mines.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was that Luo Zheng had already traveled across a thousand supreme worlds. It was a distance that she could never imagine.</p>

  <p>Many warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would never be able to cross such a distance in their entire lives!</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, Zheng's destination this time was the Dark World, which was not too far. He had been traveling through the trans-border passage when he happened to receive her message from the supreme world below.</p>

  <p>When he received Freya's response, he knew that she must be no more than twenty thousand miles away from him. And there was only one big city, called Bright Sky City, within such radius. Without hesitation, Luo Zheng had turned his horse and headed straight for the Bright Sky City.</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng it was a big city by the Central Region's standards, but that was not accurate in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>In fact, there were thirty-six thousand cities of a similar size in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Master Shen and Master He, who had taken Luo Zheng out of the mine, were each in charge of over a thousand such cities.</p>

  <p>After arriving at the Bright Sky City, Luo Zheng ordered his Heavenly Phoenix Horse to descend to the ground. There was a no-fly ban in the city, so it was not a good idea for him to ride his flying horse into the city.</p>

  <p>After he landed, he took out the spirit beast bag, wanting to drive the Heavenly Phoenix Horse into it.</p>

  <p>The space inside the spirit beast bag was quite large, but to Zheng's surprise, the Heavenly Phoenix Horse seemed to be rather resistant to the spirit beast bag. It raised its forelegs and kept retreating, refusing to enter the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The horse had been very docile the whole way. So Luo Zheng was perplexed by the beast's reaction. He couldn't understand why it resisted the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>"Could it be because of the Ancestral Dragon?" Xun asked.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was a very special creature after all. Despite its submissiveness to Luo Zheng, its overwhelming Mu Ning couldn't be ignored. The Heavenly Phoenix Horse was also a legendary beast, but it had an instinctive fear of the Ancestral Dragon, so Luo Zheng had no choice but to lead the horse into the city.</p>

  <p>On the way, he continued communicating with Freya through the message rune.</p>
