<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Rhydian had originally planned to unleash his full strength once he was about five feet away from the red light dots. While gravity was steady, he thought he could seize an opportunity to charge forward and get the weapon.</p>

  <p>It was said a master had once used this method to obtain a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However, Rhydian had almost reached his limits for now. It would be difficult for him to raise his height even by an inch. At the moment, he could only rely on his own will to hold on.</p>

  <p>After several seconds, he finally managed to rise a few feet higher. He realized that he was now a spent arrow; if he didn't employ his full strength now, he might never get another chance to do so. At the thought of this, he gritted his teeth and the life vitality within his body began to roll over in massive waves.</p>

  <p>Rhydian had been rising slowly, but now with his life vitality surging, he suddenly sped up.</p>

  <p>In the moment that his strength erupted, the gravity pressing down from the dome multiplied by several times.</p>

  <p>"I've been tricked!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>To himself, he wondered, 'Didn't they say that there would be a delay in the increase of gravity? Why did the gravitational force increase the moment my power erupted?'</p>

  <p>The white-browed man sitting at the table had a sneer on his face. "By using crooked ways instead of relying on your own strength, you will always fail miserably!"</p>

  <p>Actually, it wasn't that Rhydian had been tricked.</p>

  <p>It was indeed possible to collect the divine weapon from the dome by using this method in a certain window of time.</p>

  <p>The gravity divine texture on the dome constantly detected the martial artist's condition. However, this detection had a certain degree of time-delay. Some martial artists discovered the loophole, so they suppressed their strength at the beginning when they flew to the dome and then unleashed it when they figured that it was time to take advantage.</p>

  <p>Although this period of delay was short� less than the blink of an eye� it was enough for a martial artist to ascend.</p>

  <p>Weapon House certainly could not allow such a loophole to exist.</p>

  <p>Although they did not explicitly ban it, they secretly repaired the divine texture on the dome and eliminated it.</p>

  <p>This was something that Rhydian didn't know. He falsely believed that he could take advantage of the loophole and get the divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Although the life vitality within his body had been unleashed, the gravitational force too multiplied by several times. The burst of life vitality had driven his body higher by several feet, but it was still some distance away from the nearest speck of red light.</p>

  <p>Worse, the speck of red light intentionally floated toward him. He was only a foot away from the red dot, but the small gap was like a chasm for Rhydian.</p>

  <p>"I'll go all out to get it!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Rhydian's eyes flashed red. He bit down on the tip of his tongue and his blood essence began to burn.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to restore one's blood essence once it had been used up.</p>

  <p>One had to pay a great price to make up for it.</p>

  <p>Right now, Rhydian was like a gambler who had lost everything. The more he lost, the more he wanted to win back what he had lost.</p>

  <p>However, Rhydian seemed to have forgotten that the effect of the gravity divine texture increased with the surge in one's power. After burning his blood essence, he obtained the force to ascend upward, but that gravity also intensified.</p>

  <p>There was one foot left, and then half a foot, until finally he was one inch away from the red light dot�</p>

  <p>Struggling under the influence of the massive gravitational force, Rhydian was now just before the red dot.</p>

  <p>If he remembered correctly, the treasured sword inside this particular speck of light was the Ten Directions Howling Sword.</p>

  <p>He had researched on this Ten Directions Howling Sword before in detail. It was not heavy when one held it, but in reality, it contained the weight of ten thousand mountain ranges. The wielder of the sword could use this weight the way he desired. So if one were to wield such a sword, it would be equivalent to slashing an opponent with the strength of ten thousand mountain ranges.</p>

  <p>If he could get it, the money he had spent would be well worth it.</p>

  <p>Rhydian gritted his teeth. He could feel his fingertips already touch the red dot of light. As long as he could rise above just half an inch, he would be able to get hold of it.</p>

  <p>But just at this moment, a strange thing happened, making his heart plummet. The light dot leaped nimbly, then flew away from Rhydian�</p>

  <p>The specks of light above the dome weren't fixed in place. They were like little fairies as they flew around the dome.</p>

  <p>When he saw this, Rhydian could no longer hold on. As his strength weakened, his entire body was hurled down by gravity.</p>

  <p>As he fell, his hands began to wildly snatch at the air in an attempt to grab onto some other divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The deafening thud rang throughout Weapon House as Rhydian's body crashed to the ground. During his fall, he had indeed managed to grab onto a divine weapon. Rhydian, who was now lying on the ground, brought the divine weapon closer to take a look and nearly vomited blood out of anger. It was a secondary third-rank divine weapon, which was worse than what his younger brother had got his hands on.</p>

  <p>"I still failed!"</p>

  <p>"It's still commendable. Rhydian is indeed not someone ordinary. He just needs some good fortune!"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that he has burnt up his blood essence. He must have suffered a huge loss!"</p>

  <p>As Rhydian rose from the ground, he wore a dejected expression on his face. He tossed the secondary third-rank divine weapon in his hand to the side.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Rhydian was about to lose his temper, the white-browed elder smiled and asked, "Do you want to try again?"</p>

  <p>"No need!" Rhydian stated coldly. He had paid a lot for this but in the end, he only obtained a secondary third-rank divine weapon. He felt mortified and didn't want to stay here any longer, so he decided to take Matteo with him and leave.</p>

  <p>It was then that Luo Zheng handed over a jade pendant in his hand to the old man and asked, "If I want to obtain one of those first-rank divine weapons, would I have to pay another hundred life vitality jades?"</p>

  <p>The jade pendant was the ticket to obtain a divine weapon from the dome. In reality, it was equivalent to three hundred life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng asked if he needed to pay another one hundred life vitality jades, his intention of acquiring a first rank divine weapon was obvious.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, Rhydian, who had been preparing to leave, suddenly stopped and turned around. With a mocking expression on his face, he said in a low voice, "Ha! A warrior who just entered Mist Palace wants to attain a first rank divine weapon? You overestimate yourself!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he decided to stay. He wanted to see if Luo Zheng was just talking big or if he really possessed the courage to go after a first rank divine weapon. When people fell and hurt themselves, they hoped that others would fall too, for it at least proved that they were not the only fools to make mistakes.</p>

  <p>The white-browed elder chuckled and said, "Yes. However, according to the rules, if someone has already paid one hundred more life vitality jades, others can also try their hands on the first rank divine weapons up on the dome!"</p>

  <p>What he meant was that Luo Zheng did not need to give him one hundred life vitality jades. The white-browed elder would not put the four first-rank divine weapons away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded briefly and said, "But I still want to see the pictures of all those weapons."</p>

  <p>It was not that he was greedy. He just knew that it was not so simple to choose a weapon that suited him, so he wanted to take a closer look to see if he had better choice.</p>

  <p>"Sure." The old man nodded and quickly unrolled the picture scroll before handing it to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were a total of sixteen first rank divine weapons on the first page.</p>

  <p>Rhydian had picked out four swords out of these sixteen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng skimmed through the pictures one by one. Apart from the four swords that Rhydian had chosen, there were sabers, spears, bows, and even a bag of arrows�</p>

  <p>One look alone told Luo Zheng that he did not need to pay another one hundred life vitality jades to get any of these. However, after flipping over the paper, he discovered that there was another page of weapons.</p>

  <p>"Eh? There is a second page?" A curious expression appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Only three weapons were pictured on the second page.</p>

  <p>When Rhydian saw Zheng's curious expression, his lip curled. "You don't need to look at the second page. You can't get those weapons!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Rhydian indifferently. "What does that have to do with you? I'm the one who gets to decide which page I want to look at!"</p>

  <p>Rhydian was furious about picking a secondary third-rank divine weapon, but when he heard the kid who had only just entered Mist Palace speak to him in such a manner, killing intent arose within him.</p>

  <p>Matteo, who was beside him, said, "Brother, he is one rude brat!"</p>

  <p>Sensing Rhydian's killing intent, Luo Zheng remained unmoved. Instead, he glanced at Metteo with contempt as he continued to examine the second page.</p>

  <p>The white-browed elder smiled. "Everyone must observe the rules of Weapon House. If you want to fight, go outside!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Rhydian would not fight here. He only wanted to intimidate Luo Zheng. The white-browed man turned to Luo Zheng. "The weapons on the second page were left behind by former leaders of the palace. If you pay another one hundred life vitality jades, you can choose one of those three items and I will put it on the dome."</p>
