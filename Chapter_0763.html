<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 763 Mad Trap </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In just half a month, a strong sense of crisis had pervaded the entire Cloud Hall, Cloudy City and five second-grade sects under the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt the heavy tension in the air as a constant state of danger hung over their heads, plunging their hearts in a perpetual state of panic.</p>

  <p>Emanuel had made sure to spread words of Zheng's deeds in the Martial Arts Contest all over Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm actually killed Eddie's woman in front of him and was able to leave unscathed.</p>

  <p>The news had been shocking, and after many embellishments, the rumors floating around had described Luo Zheng as some kind of omnipotent character.</p>

  <p>His story had become like some kind of legend, spreading all over taverns, tea houses, and restaurants.</p>

  <p>"I heard that Luo Zheng slashed Marilyn's neck right in front of Eddie! He didn't give a damn that Eddie was the number one warrior of Central Region."</p>

  <p>"Eddie is a warrior at the Life and Death Realm. He is someone who can kill a person with just one look, but a teenager was able to kill his woman. I know that there are many talents in the world, but still Luo Zheng was too bold to kill Eddie's woman."</p>

  <p>"He is a genius, to begin with. Moreover, he was able to destroy Eden's warrior spirit with just a few words. Ha! I don't even know what his talent is— it's simply impossible to describe!"</p>

  <p>"He may have the talent and he may have walked away from Eddie safe and sound, but he has spelled disaster for Cloud Hall. What if Eddie comes to the Cloud Hall for revenge? The whole sect is at risk because of Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think the leader of Cloud Hall should have supported Luo Zheng. Because of her support, Eddie would now set himself against Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>"Humph, the leader of Cloud Hall looks cold and aloof, but I think she has a crush on Luo Zheng. Of course she'd lose her cool when she saw her lover in trouble. Luo Zheng is so lucky to have such a beautiful woman."</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of discussion regarding the rumors, Yudie's decision, and the imminent threat of Cloud Hall's destruction at Eddie's hands.</p>

  <p>When the rumors reached Cloudy City, the entire place had become shrouded in haze.</p>

  <p>What if Eddie came? What would Cloud School do? Would the Cloud Hall survive?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the situation in Cloud Hall couldn't be more intense. In the beginning, Ning Yudie had still been able to pull out her leader card when it came to suppressing people from stirring up trouble. Inevitably, she gradually lost control as the issue blew up, and she decided to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>The elders, clan leaders, and sect leaders couldn't find any outlet to vent out their frustrations, so they decided to target Luo Zheng. When they heard that Luo Zheng was setting up the sect-protecting array with Felix, they immediately went to find them.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, Emanuel was having a great time.</p>

  <p>Before, Emanuel had been the person that had the most potential of taking over the position of sect leader. Had it not been for Ning Yudie, the one sitting on the throne would've been Emanuel. This fact had always made him bitter and he was always on the lookout for a chance to snatch the position.</p>

  <p>It might be a crisis for others, but for Emanuel, it was an opportunity. Eddie was an independent warrior with the ambition of establishing his own divine kingdom to take control of the entire Central Region. A mere Cloud Hall was nothing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>If Eddie came to Cloud Hall and killed Ning Yudie and Imogen, Emanuel could immediately defect to Eddie's side. By doing so, he would get the backing of the strongest warrior in the entire Central Region. No one in Cloud Hall would dare compete with him after that.</p>

  <p>However, before his plans came to fruition, Emanuel would still need to pretend to be a good person. He could vent unhappiness while also winning the hearts of others by doing so.</p>

  <p>In fact, the main reason why everyone had dared to come to Felix today was because of Emanuel.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the ferocious crowd that had gathered in front of him, Felix immediately roared in anger, "What are you all trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing! We just want you to hand over that brat, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Felix, I respect you as an elder of Cloud Hall. Go hide in the corner and we won't embarrass you."</p>

  <p>The other elders would usually have to beg for Felix's help given that he was a runic expect. Everyone would always be nice to him in fear of giving him offense. However, things were different and the people were angry for Luo Zheng. No runic expert would calm their resolve now.</p>

  <p>The crowd pushed itself into the great hall and immediately recognized Luo Zheng with a single glance.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng dipped his brush into the ink and was drawing a second five-star divine texture.</p>

  <p>The divine texture was called "Thunder Wrath." He had to amplify the Thunder Law to its limit. It had taken a while for the cyan dragon to find the right feeling before he was able to pour his soul force into the rune.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The power of thunder was known for being violent and fast. A blue lightning arc appeared as soon as the cyan dragon's soul force activated the runic power in the ink. It was as thin as a hair strand but it contained the entirety of Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>"What is that brat doing?"</p>

  <p>"He isn't drawing runes. He's cultivating, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Just ignore whatever he's doing and take him away!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, let's take a look first! A brat at the Illuminating Soul Realm won't be able to flee from all of us anyway."</p>

  <p>Their loud discussions had Luo Zheng glancing at them briefly before concentrating once again on drawing the divine texture. Although the drawing of the divine texture relied mainly on the cyan dragon's soul force, Luo Zheng still needed to control the strokes and draw up the lines.</p>

  <p>Violent arcs of lightning suddenly erupted from his brush as the tip made contact with the paper. As he drew back his brush, a boundless lightning bolt burst forth.</p>

  <p>The sudden eruption of lightning could've made any person blind, but Zheng's eyes were wide and unblinking. It was as if lightning had been chiseled onto the paper.</p>

  <p>At that moment, it looked as if he was the son of thunder and lightning— a god that controlled the electric plasma to serve all his needs.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The crowd had become quiet, only staring in shock at what was in front of them.</p>

  <p>Only the crackle of lightning could be heard in the entire great hall. The more timid warriors would even tremble from time to time.</p>

  <p>"The last stroke!"</p>

  <p>The rune brush spun around Zheng's hand, forming a perfect circle. He used his thumb to hold the paper in place and with a gentle roll, the divine texture was sealed.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The crackle of lightning gradually subsided and returned to silence. In the end, the divine texture had turned into a plain ink script.</p>

  <p>"Is he...really drawing runes?"</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for what Felix said, I would have thought he was practicing some extremely powerful cultivation method!"</p>

  <p>"So powerful. Maybe his sect-protecting array can really fight against Eddie and protect Cloud Hall from harm!"</p>

  <p>Hearing them, Luo Zheng didn't show any emotions. He carefully placed his rune brush back down and walked to the edge of the wall to place his hands in a basin of clear water. Although the lightning would never harm him, the high temperature it produced had an effect on how his hands felt. He still needed to draw up the third and final rune.</p>

  <p>The last rune was called "Mad Trap" and true to its name, it was a trap— a killing trap to be exact, meant to imprison and kill powerful enemies.</p>

  <p>Shaking off the water droplets, Luo Zheng used a fluffy, white towel, to wipe them dry before returning to his seat.</p>

  <p>It was here that Felix came to his side and personally helped him remove the "Thunder Wrath" rune, replacing it with brand new runic paper and then respectfully moving aside.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng once again picked up his brush and dipped it in the ink that an assistant handed to him. The cyan dragon's soul power once again swirled around him.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Unlike the previous violent lightning, his brush now showcased a dreamy color.</p>

  <p>Most of the materials used to create the "Mad Trap" included "Charm Bone" and "a thousand-year-old fox heart" that were specifically used to set up the magic array. Even Luo Zheng had almost lost his way when he tried to activate the energy inside those materials.</p>

  <p>From his brush, the dreamy sight of Yudie's beautiful and unparalleled face blossomed forth.</p>

  <p>In the illusion, she was half-naked and her petite yet powerful body was slowly walking towards him. Her usual cold eyes were nowhere to be found and were instead full of warmth and seduction.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was prepared to pull him out of this befuddlement, but even before he was able to do anything, a bit of lightning flashed across Zheng's face and his eyes once again became clear.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's right," the cyan dragon said. "Your willpower is so firm that you can break free from this illusion yourself. Start drawing then." Though he was a bit surprised, the cyan dragon also thought that it should've been something he had expected from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Luo Zheng once again began to draw. Lines of illusory colors burst from his brush onto the drawing paper while pink and purple mist began to rise along with the soft, brush strokes.</p>

  <p>Although he was able to pull himself out of the illusion, the others weren't so strong-willed. Felix and the rest of the crowd all stared at the mist with dull gazes, almost as if their souls were being sucked in by the dreamy soft and purple haze.</p>
