<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After their last encounter, Zheng was sure that Athemar tended to do things according to what his heart dictated.</p>

  <p>With a smile, he asked, "How were you so sure that I'd choose the Flow Sword Sect?"</p>

  <p>"Because I was waiting for you on the mountain. If you chose to join the Killing Sword Sect or the Unique Array Sword Sect, I would just have nudged you to choose otherwise." Athemar shrugged as though it was no big deal.</p>

  <p>Such a blunt reply left Zheng speechless. Finally, he said, "That means you are indeed from the Flow Sword Sect, right?"</p>

  <p>"That's right." Athemar nodded, and then pushed the brocade box towards Zheng. "You have chosen three truth swordsmanship manuals. I believe you have achieved something on all of them. But I hope you can focus on the Flow Strike."</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" asked Zheng curiously.</p>

  <p>He knew he had a lot to learn.</p>

  <p>The Thousand Annihilation Strike from the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship required constant training before any progress could be made. Now that Zheng had the Eye of Will, he was looking forward to feeling the power of Sword Texture Technique. Although he had almost learnt all there was to it, he still needed time to master it.</p>

  <p>Also, he wanted to further study the two Sanskrit words Geoffrey helped translate for him...</p>

  <p>"Because we're running out of time," Athemar said in a suddenly serious tone. "You have to improve your cultivation base as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Improving one's cultivation base meant that one had to travel to the Other Shore. But what did cultivating have to do with this?</p>

  <p>Observing Zheng's confused face, Athemar continued, "To be precise, the Flow Strike is not a theurgy of sword skill, but a theurgy of mind cultivation. The most powerful thing about it doesn't lie in this world."</p>

  <p>"You mean it is on the Other Shore?" asked Zheng incredulously.</p>

  <p>The Flow Strike was said to be training for the heart, but that was just an expression. In the past, people hadn't studied the secret of the soul thoroughly. They thought the soul was located in the heart, but in actuality, the soul was in the brain.</p>

  <p>In essence, the test Zheng received in the Flow Tower was a test on his soul.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Athemar nodded in satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"But why are we running out of time?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You are still in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, so you have no idea yet..." Athemar paused, deep in thought. "First," he continued, "master the Flow Strike, then go to the Other Shore as soon as possible. This will allow you to grow more powerful. The Flow Sword Sect will arrange for it."</p>

  <p>Apart from the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, Zheng had always struggled with gaining more divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>If he could obtain another powerful Other Shore Token from the Other Shore, his force would probably increase by several times.</p>

  <p>Without saying anything else, Athemar took his leave.</p>

  <p>'What arrangements will the Flow Sword Sect make?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>He remembered what Dorothy had told him once. The palace had established its own forces and temple on the Other Shore, so they had easy access to Other Shore Tokens and could arrange for their disciples to get relatively good ones. What Athemar said could be implying that the Flow Sword Sect could obtain fancy Other Shore Tokens easily as well. Now that Zheng was thinking about it, it made sense that the palace would be keeping an eye out for their elite disciples. Why would they leave those precious young minds risking their lives when they had all the valuable Other Shore Tokens at hand?</p>

  <p>If that was the case, he realized entering the Other Shore would do him some good. But before that, he had to follow Athemar's instructions and master the Flow Strike first.</p>

  <p>Zheng opened the brocade box before him and took out the Flow Swordsmanship...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, under the Nether Mountain, in the central part of the Square Captivity province, a massive massacre was taking place.</p>

  <p>The Nether Mountain had 33 caves, in which 33 races gathered.</p>

  <p>The Nether Mountain was not very popular in the Source World; It only attracted branches of some races.</p>

  <p>The human race also had a branch there named "Nineteenth Cave Humans".</p>

  <p>There weren't many powerful warriors in the 33 caves. The best among the Nineteenth Cave Humans were only at the second stage of the Other Shore Realm, and the same went for the other races.</p>

  <p>Given the lack of competition, the 33 races had lived in peace together.</p>

  <p>If they were to encounter the invasion of some outsiders, they would join hands to defend the Nether Mountain together.</p>

  <p>However, what had happened that day shocked the Nineteenth Cave Humans deeply.</p>

  <p>A strong scent of blood wafted to the nineteenth cave from the Nether Mountain.</p>

  <p>Several bats flew to the nineteenth cave, squeaking for help. "Please go talk to him...squeak!... Make him stop slaughtering our race!"</p>

  <p>The head of the Nineteenth Cave Humans waved them away with a bitter smile. "What can I do? You messed with that horrible man first!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! We just fed on his Bull Lion! That's all! It was just one Bull Lion!</p>

  <p>Just one! We can give him one hundred divine crystals for compensation!</p>

  <p>Or even a thousand! Why does he have to slaughter all of us?" The bat was growing desperate. Angrily, it flew at the head's face. "Aren't we supposed to support each other? Now our race is in trouble! You're just going to sit there and do nothing?"</p>

  <p>The head of the Nineteenth Cave Humans clenched his teeth and finally stood up. Gathering several able-bodied companions, he said, "I'll try to persuade him again."</p>

  <p>Then he jumped down from the hillside and landed at the foot of the Nether Mountain.</p>

  <p>He took a gander at the gory scene before him. Countless bats were torn into shreds, and the soil turned black, soaked in their blood.</p>

  <p>This was just the entrance to the cave. What horrors lay within the cave?</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Explosions could be heard from inside the third cave, where the bat race was located.</p>

  <p>Many bats were flying haphazardly, desperately trying to escape the cave.</p>

  <p>But whenever they got close to the exit, a flash of white light would instantly annihilate them.</p>

  <p>In the past, when faced with attacks, the 33 races would usually join hands to fight against the enemy.</p>

  <p>However, the Cyan Spirit race from the second cave lost majority of its population to the horrible man, just because they tried to come to the bat race's aid. Even the head of the Cyan Spirit race had been brutally murdered. It was no wonder no one else dared stand up to this man!</p>

  <p>Everyone else was cooped up in their caves, hoping the worst was over.</p>

  <p>The Nineteenth Cave Humans initially didn't want to get involved either...</p>

  <p>However, this horrible man was a human!</p>

  <p>Thinking that he might stop if they tried talking to him, they had sent two Nineteenth Cave Humans to the third cave. They had barely stepped inside the cave when a white light flashed, and their heads rolled out onto the soil.</p>

  <p>Horrified by this scene, the Nineteenth Cave Humans decided to stay out of this fight.</p>

  <p>The reason of this whole slaughter was the death of a Bull Lion.</p>

  <p>The horrible man had tied his tamed Bull Lion by the road. The bat race, living solely on blood, couldn't resist the temptation of the tied up Bull Lion! Bull Lion blood was extremely delicious, after all!</p>

  <p>But it turned out that they totally messed with the wrong Bull Lion.</p>

  <p>The bat race was getting slaughtered. If no one stepped in soon, they'd be completely annihilated. With a sigh, the head of the Nineteenth Cave Humans decided he couldn't just sit and let that happen.</p>

  <p>Once he reached the entrance of the third cave, he took a deep breath, and tried to take a cautious peek inside.</p>

  <p>Just as he caught sight of the man, he was instantly knocked down by a tremendous force. When he finally realized what had happened, the man was already stepping on his chest, an evil smile plastered on his face. "I've been in this world for so long. There are all kinds of demons and monsters everywhere. I never thought I'd run into someone from the same race here!</p>

  <p>But! How dare you speak for those lowly creatures? You deserve to die!"</p>
