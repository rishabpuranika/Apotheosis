  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could try anything else, another snow-white flower bloomed beside Luo Luo Zheng. Dorothea quietly stepped out from it. When she saw Luo Zheng's actions, she smiled faintly and told him, "The barrier cast by Delroy won't be broken so easily. You might as well give up and save your energy!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at her and asked, "What's inside?"</p>

  <p>She chuckled, "If I tell you, will you obediently follow me? I guarantee that I won't let you suffer or come to any harm!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng smiled, "In that case, you have to tell me first."</p>

  <p>"This is a sacred place; the Ancestral Dragon and the Evil Dragon appeared in here at the same time. At the end of this era, our Celestial Position will naturally collect them. We must stop the Evil Dragon, and also get the Ancestral Dragon." Dorothea answered.</p>

  <p>"So, is it the Ancestral Dragon inside this spire? Or is there more to the story?" Luo Zheng's eyes glinted.</p>

  <p>Dorothea tilted her head and replied in affirmative with a smile, "Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Great!" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly took out the Black Star pickax from his space ring and swooshed it down towards the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Originally, Dorothea wasn't concerned even though Max had been worried that Luo Luo Zheng would run around and barge into this place, interfering with the incubation of the Ancestral Dragon egg. However, Dorothea was sure that this worry was unnecessary, since Delroy's enchanted barrier was not that easy to break.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, she could sense that although the woman in front of her seemed to be alive, she was, in fact relying on a Soul Core to drive her physical body; this meant that she would be unable to unleash her strength.</p>

  <p>As for why Luo Luo Zheng was able to use his unique movement technique, and how he was moving so fast, Dorothea could not understand. But no matter what, speed and strength were two different things. And the enchanted barrier that Delroy had cast contained a special Law of Causality, so it could not have been broken by an ordinary cultivator at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng pulled out the pickax, her expression changed drastically. At the same time, the flower in her eye started to spin crazily and turned a dirty shade of red from its usual, beautiful white.</p>

  <p>"The supreme divine weapon Black Star!" Dorothea screamed.</p>

  <p>By the time she had finished, Luo Luo Zheng had already brandished the pickax and struck the enchanted barrier. The barrier suddenly shattered. Since in its entirety, the barrier was a single entity, even if a single part of it was damaged, the entire barrier would instantly shatter like powdered glass!</p>

  <p>With a loud clang, the enchanted barrier collapsed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, among the group of six men who were still fighting the Evil Dragon, a middle-aged man dressed in an embroidered green robe, suddenly cursed with a shocked expression on his face, "Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Max, who was wearing a silver mask, asked, "Delroy, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Someone destroyed my enchanted barrier!" Delroy replied with a frown.</p>

  <p>The moment they heard his words, the faces of Max and everyone else turned grim.</p>

  <p>This time, once they had entered the Lower World, everything had gone smoothly inside the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. That was thanks to one of the Celestial Position warriors, who had used a secret technique to manipulate Max's luck, allowing him to essentially double the good fortunes that came on him within a few months.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, they should have been able to smoothly capture the Evil Dragon, and have the Ancestral Dragon hatched. Then they could have brought the Evil Dragon and the Ancestral Dragon back to the Celestial Position Race.</p>

  <p>But now, a change had occurred.</p>

  <p>Delroy's enchanted barrier had covered the top of the tower and locked it inside. Once Max changed the time flow rate, it wouldn't take long for the Ancestral Dragon egg to hatch. All they needed to do was focus on dealing with the Evil Dragon.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the enchanted barrier had been broken.</p>

  <p>"Could it be the woman who just escaped?" the tall and sturdy man ran over and asked, defending himself from a wave of fire. He had dodged the Evil Dragon's claw and replaced himself with someone else.</p>

  <p>"Impossible. Even though that woman is at the Spirit Supreme Realm, she's not strong enough to shatter Delroy's enchanted barrier. I wonder what Dorothea is doing. She has been away for too long now. It gives me the jitters. Woody, go check," Max instructed.</p>

  <p>The black-clothed youth nodded his head. The cynical smile on his face disappeared, and his figure turned into a black shadow. He flew towards the tower like a ghost.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, the moment he managed to break the barrier, he got inside it.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate within the enchanted barrier was completely different from that of the outside world. It seemed to be flowing several times faster, and he could actually see the plants reproduce, die, reproduce and then die again quickly.</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's perspective, he did not feel anything. But Dorothea, outside the enchanted barrier, essentially saw him disappear with a flash after he got inside the tower. All this was because the time flow rate gradient between the outside world and the tower.</p>

  <p>Dorothea gritted her teeth and with a flash, she also entered the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>However, because of the delay of about 30 seconds that had elapsed when she hesitated to go behind Luo Luo Zheng, the time gap she had to face was huge.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate inside was a very interesting number. For the 30 seconds that Dorothea had wasted outside gawking at Luo Zheng's invisible figure, more than eight hours had passed for Luo Luo Zheng on the inside.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't feel that difference at all once he was inside.</p>

  <p>In fact, from his perspective, he felt that time was going by at a normal speed. Only those who were outside the barrier could see just how amazing the consequences of a different time flow rate were.</p>

  <p>"The tower..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head to look at the huge structure in front of him. If it weren't for all those unexpected events that had happened in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, this place would have been the destination of Luo Luo Zheng and the other Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Also, he had no idea what kinds of traps were inside this tower. Even after so many years, not a single Soul Sea Realm warrior had ever managed to fetch the Ancestral Dragon egg.</p>

  <p>Although it was highly embarrassing to be chased by someone, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't bothered about that. His goal this time was the Ancestral Dragon egg. It was a coincidence that he had accidentally entered this place.</p>

  <p>He walked straight towards the door of the huge structure in front of him.</p>

  <p>He had originally intended to break through the door. But the moment he came to and stood in front of it, a ray of faint light glistened from the door frame. Once it had circled around the door frame once, the door slowly opened of its own accord.</p>

  <p>Behind the door was a pitch-black space.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his head to look at the outside world. The sky was what greeted him. Perhaps it was because of the Time Law that except for the area that lay about several hundred feet around the tower, the entire Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had disappeared from Luo Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>Anyway, since he could not see Dorothea chasing him anymore, Luo Luo Zheng stepped through the door.</p>

  <p>Now he saw that in the empty space, there were glowing steps. These steps were circling around and rising up. Luo Luo Zheng stepped on them and started to climb quickly.</p>

  <p>After climbing for a while, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly saw a giant chain appear at the top of the stairs. He looked carefully at it and found that a small, glowing object was attached in the middle of the chains.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was completely tied up by the numerous chains that surrounded it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared intently at it and suddenly, his eyes sparked, "This is..."</p>

  <p>"The Ancestral Dragon egg," a calm voice sounded from within his inner world. It was obvious that Brianna had also noticed the object and recognized it.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face, but then he heard Brianna tell him, in a tone that sounded like she was shaking her head, "You can't take it away!"</p>

  <p>"I can't? What do you mean? Why not?" Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>"If it were so easy to obtain, it wouldn't have taken the four divine kingdoms and their emperors so many years," Brianna pointed out faintly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng agreed with her words. The Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place wasn't that dangerous, yet the Soul Sea Realm warriors of the four divine kingdoms, who had entered the place so many times, had still been unable to get their hands on the Ancestral Dragon egg.</p>

  <p>"These are just some chains. I think I can handle them." Luo Luo Zheng shook his head as he spoke, though his face revealed a look of doubt. He thought that those warriors hadn't been able to get the egg because the chains were too hard to break. Luckily, he had the Black Star. It shouldn't be difficult for him to break this chain. He had to try anyway.</p>
