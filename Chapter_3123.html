<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3123 The Situation Of Sword Light Palace </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>One year ago, the Seven-Star City had been destroyed, with nothing more than rubble and ruins left. It had been a mess.</p>

  <p>Now, after more than a year of restoration, there were no signs that it had been destroyed the year prior.</p>

  <p>However, too many people had died. Even though many people had come here from other cities in the Seven-Star Province, one couldn't shake off the feeling of desolation in this city.</p>

  <p>To recover the level of prosperity it was before would take at least a hundred years of peace.</p>

  <p>Laura pondered over this as she stood in front of the Lofty Sword, overlooking the mountains and rivers. A gloomy expression took over her face.</p>

  <p>A year ago, the Qiu Clan and the Yuebai Clan were still fighting for power.</p>

  <p>She thought the competition would be good for the Sword Light Palace. But she had not expected that Reynald's choices would lead them to a dead end.</p>

  <p>"Time for a shift!"</p>

  <p>Ingram's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Most elites of the Sword Light Palace were dead. The only hope of their people was Ingram, Laura, and the Lofty Sword on the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword used to be guarded by the officiant. Now, Ingram and Laura took shifts looking after it.</p>

  <p>"I can hold on... for several more days." Laura shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Don't even try. Even the officiant would rest from time to time. This is exhausting," said Ingram concernedly.</p>

  <p>When the Sword Light Palace was at its prime, the sword was rarely used.</p>

  <p>Normally, high-level warriors could protect the place.</p>

  <p>But now, times were different. Every hour of the day, they needed to keep a close eye on it.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>As Laura let out a tired sigh, a black thing suddenly flashed in the sky in the distance.</p>

  <p>After what happened last year, Laura and the others had become highly vigilant. There was no way they were going to risk being lax.</p>

  <p>Before identifying who or what the black thing was, she immediately activated the Lofty Sword. Suddenly, the surface of its blade glowed in intricate patterns.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Countless beams of dense sword light shot out and intertwined around the palace, forming a huge net. This was the Sword Light Palace's defense.</p>

  <p>"It's a flying ship. Don't be so nervous," Ingram said soothingly.</p>

  <p>Laura nodded as she eyed the black boat steadily approaching. Finally, the black boat came to a stop, hovering right in front of the sword net.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Laura called out to the mysterious boat. "What brings you here to the Sword Light Palace?"</p>

  <p>From the black flying boat, they heard an indignant snort. Then, a veiled woman leapt from the boat and flew towards the sword net.</p>

  <p>Laying her hand on the sword net, the woman began to emanate a flash of red light.</p>

  <p>The red light suddenly transformed into the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The sword net suddenly buckled. Even the Lofty Sword trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>The woman said indifferently, "We've traveled thousands of miles from Pear Hill. You need not be polite to us, but why must you be so hostile?</p>

  <p>Don't force me to destroy the Lofty Sword!"</p>

  <p>Shocked at what they were seeing, Laura and Ingram exchanged worried glances.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect the people on the flying boat to be so arrogant. She didn't even respect their Lofty Sword!</p>

  <p>In addition, she was from Pear Hill!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race was on a par with the Oneness Sky Palace, maybe even stronger.</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Ingram humbly, trying to assuage her, "the Sword Light Palace was attacked by the nonhuman creatures not too long ago. We're just extremely nervous, please, forgive us!"</p>

  <p>Sensing Ingram's sincerity, the veiled woman loosened her grip on the sword net.</p>

  <p>Turning back to the boat, she called out, "Yan, just ask them...!"</p>

  <p>Another veiled woman quietly flew out of the flying boat.</p>

  <p>Slowly descending towards the sword net, she asked softly, "I'm looking for someone. His name is  Zheng Luo..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that name, Laura and Ingram exchanged puzzled glances.</p>

  <p>Laura knew little about Zheng's background, especially since he had been quite secretive.</p>

  <p>She had not expected that he was related to the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"What's your relation with him?" Laura asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>Yan smiled slightly. She could tell they had met Zheng. "I'm his younger sister. Where is my brother?"</p>

  <p>"He has been taken away by Winchell of the Oneness Sky Palace. He should be in the Bloom Divine Province now," Laura replied.</p>

  <p>Laura took a quick survey of the boat. She could see there were many women aboard, and all were powerful-looking.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's sister was being escorted by these people, her status was obviously not low. That must mean Zheng came from a powerful and wealthy family, right? Why didn't he go to Pear Hill instead of the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>"Should I go to the Bloom Divine Province?" Yan frowned, her disappointment evident.</p>

  <p>The first veiled woman, sensing Yan's disappointment, said, "Yan, you promised to cross the Sea of Truth as soon as possible. Before that, you must improve your cultivation. If you miss the opportunity to enter the Miracle Temple, it would be troublesome. We don't have much time."</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill was quite far from here, with many provinces in between. To save time, they had asked for help from the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>If they journeyed to the Bloom Divine Province, it would eat up the time they saved with the Snake Goddess's help, maybe even more.</p>

  <p>Yan had promised that she would quit her search for her brother once she was assured he was alive. Laura had just confirmed this for her. There was no more need to keep searching for him.</p>

  <p>"Hmm..." Yan was still a little worried. She gracefully descended till she landed right in front of Laura. "Will my brother be safe at the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>Laura smiled reassuringly. "Your brother is extraordinary. There's no doubt he would be taken good care of there. Don't worry."</p>

  <p>Yan thought about it for a while. "What happened to my brother here in the Seven-Star Province?"</p>

  <p>Laura and Ingram happily shared with her what they knew of Zheng's experiences. After all, he had saved their lives. They felt indebted to him.</p>

  <p>Actually, without Zheng, the Sword Light Palace wouldn't have survived at all.</p>

  <p>After hearing all the details, Yan was relieved. She bade them goodbye and flew back to her boat with the veiled woman.</p>

  <p>Watching the black flying boat sail into the distance, Laura turned to Ingram. "This girl really cares about her brother..." she said quietly, with a faint smile. "How far is Pear Hill from here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care about that," said Ingram, who was also eyeing the boat. "If I'm not mistaken, Zheng's sister is also capable of Instant Enlightenment."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" Laura pursed her lips.</p>

  <p>"The Pear Hill wants to send her to the Miracle Temple. But she hasn't even reached the Other Shore Realm. Think about it," he said seriously. "How many people in the Source World can be treated such?"</p>

  <p>Although they lived in a remote area, they were well aware of the reputation of the Miracle Temple.</p>

  <p>Only elites cultivated by super forces could enter the Miracle Temple. This was how Ingram drew conclusions about Yan's talent.</p>

  <p>"They are really special, aren't they?" Laura sighed. "I wonder what the future holds for them." While she was the one who had brought Zheng into the Sword Light Palace by instinct, she never could've expected how powerful he truly was.</p>
