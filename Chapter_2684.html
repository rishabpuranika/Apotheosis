  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Tell me more, please!" Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"It is said that Holy Nicholas is obsessed with a woman, the one in the back hall. Over the years, he has kept entering the Time Sea to look for her body. I wonder whether that woman is your mother," Tianming replied.</p>

  <p>"Looking for her body?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. Perhaps he could finally get closure. A wave of peace rolled over him.</p>

  <p>In this case, this woman was very likely to be his mother. She had not died. She just needed her physical body, and Nicholas was helping her look for it.</p>

  <p>Whatever the case was, she wasn't dead.</p>

  <p>Tianming sensed the change in Zheng's mood. "Is that woman your mother?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She must be," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>This time, it was Tianming's turn to be surprised.</p>

  <p>Zheng's father, Mike, was Murphy's nemesis. Tianming had come to know the truth about their feud over the past years. Long ago, Murphy had launched the universe war on Nicholas' orders. Mike's real enemy was, in fact, the union of the powerful clans led by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>But one question remained unanswered. Why was Nicholas so obsessed with Zheng's mother, Lorena?</p>

  <p>Tianming felt confused. He looked at Zheng with a curious expression.</p>

  <p>Now was not the time for lengthy storytelling, however. Tianming would have to remain in the dark for a little longer. Just several dozen miles ahead of Zheng, the junction of three regions came into view. He had to concentrate on the task at hand for now. Once he was out of the Square Sky Region and the Sea Vessel Region, he would attempt to escape using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Troy was using his life vitality to communicate with the other consummate True Gods, "Everyone, once Zheng enters the Snake Spirit Region, I am certain he will try to escape using the Grand Teleportation technique. The technique is not forbidden in the Snake Spirit Region. I want to try again!"</p>

  <p>No one was willing to let Zheng go.</p>

  <p>"How are we going to stop him? He is much stronger than us. We should just be thankful that he hasn't tried to kill us yet," said a consummate True God helplessly.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods were similarly discouraged. It was a severe blow to these consummate True Gods that, despite coming from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, a single man had the power to intimidate them. And yet, they cowered in fear at the sight of his unimaginably tall body.</p>

  <p>Troy, the most confident of the group, just smirked. "Is he really so much stronger than us? He is huge, I'll give you that, but size isn't everything.</p>

  <p>If the space here were not sealed, would you still be afraid of him?" he asked slyly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the eyes of the consummate True Gods lit up a little.</p>

  <p>"That's right. He's very strong physically, but this strength is a crutch. He relies on it completely, and without it he would be very easy to defeat."</p>

  <p>"If it were not for the sealed space, he would never have touched me!"</p>

  <p>"Remember, he is just a consummate True God. He is not a Demi-holy Being."</p>

  <p>The higher the cultivation level was, the lower the contribution of one's physical strength would be.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings would usually prefer to display and show off their theurgies. Brute strength was rarely used in a fight. The key reason was that it was difficult to pour power into the opponent's body.</p>

  <p>Without doubt, Zheng's Wild God Body was powerful, but once he entered the Snake Spirit Region, the threat would be greatly reduced. They wouldn't be so foolish to stand there and let Zheng smash them to bits.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the consummate True Gods would display the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again. Zheng would definitely not be a match for them.</p>

  <p>"But Zheng will also use the Grand Teleportation technique after entering the Snake Spirit Region. It won't be easy to keep him here," Rachelle said.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is why I have brought the Topsoil Bell here," said Troy with a smile.</p>

  <p>The mention of the Topsoil Bell wiped all the desolation clear from the consummate True Gods' eyes. They looked excited.</p>

  <p>The Topsoil Bell was a space treasure, one of its kind in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>As its name suggested, this bell was made out of topsoil, specifically, the topsoil at the foot of the Space Godly Way Tablet. This topsoil had accumulated there for countless years and had acquired its own intelligence under the influence of internal momentum. Therefore, the space treasure made out of it was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>After the topsoil had been excavated, the Space Godly Way Tablet had been left hanging in the air. And thus, the topsoil became extinct, and a second bell of its kind could never be made again.</p>

  <p>If they used the Topsoil Bell to envelop Zheng, he wouldn't be able to use the Grand Teleportation technique. No matter how powerful he was, he would be exposed and vulnerable as a single lamb amidst a pack of wolves.</p>

  <p>The bell changed everything, and this boosted the morale of the previously defeated and hopeless consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Yet, unbeknownst to them, Tianming had overheard their communications using the life vitality and had alerted Zheng to their plans.</p>

  <p>"If they use the Topsoil Bell, they will violate the Space Law and suffer a severe punishment from the Ruling Slate, so Troy will use it after entering the Snake Spirit Region," Tianming whispered.</p>

  <p>"I got it." Zheng smiled coldly. Now, the Snake Spirit Region was only one step away, so he wouldn't be silly to wait for Troy to use the Topsoil Bell. Then he said to Tianming, "If you can find other Godly Geniuses, invite them to visit me at the fairy palace in the Swirl Forest. Tianming, see you later!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zheng turned around.</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Zheng's enormous hand, with a width of more than a thousand feet, hurtled towards Troy's face.</p>

  <p>Troy, in the meantime, was busy, desperately trying to figure out the optimal time to summon the Topsoil Bell. The other consummate True Gods were also poised, ready to act on his command.</p>

  <p>They had decided that once Zheng's space was blocked by the Topsoil Bell, they would attack him.</p>

  <p>None of them had imagined that Zheng would move against Troy right then.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>As Troy saw Zheng's enormous hand moving towards him, his expression changed to one of horror and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>He had just used nearly all of his strength to fight Zheng, and his tank was nearly empty. His iron hand was on the verge of shattering. If he let Zheng's hand hit him, the consequences could be fatal for him.</p>

  <p>He did not even have the advantage of the Earth Godly Way because he did not cultivate it like Walton did. He couldn't transfer the power he bore to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Troy ducked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's huge palm missed the top of his head by a hair's breadth. The wind in the wake of the giant hand gushed over him, searing his scalp.</p>

  <p>After Troy had dodged his slap, the enormous thunder wings on Zheng's back flashed with light.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>It was too late. Zheng had already stepped into the Snake Spirit Region. As he turned to smile triumphantly at everyone, his entire body began to shrink.</p>

  <p>He had made sure to do it right this time. He employed the Grand Teleportation technique at the same time as his body shrank, not wasting a second. A space channel formed, and he disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Go after him! Now!" yelled one of the consummate True Gods, pointing and shaking his hand wildly at the spot where Zheng had stood a second ago.</p>

  <p>"He is nothing but a consummate True God! You know he can't get far using the Grand Teleportation alone!" shouted another.</p>

  <p>"There's still a chance to catch him!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the shock wore off and they had come to their senses, the consummate True Gods moved into the Snake Spirit Region and began to display the Grand Teleportation technique themselves.</p>

  <p>Their efforts, however, were in vain. Even though what they said was technically true, Zheng was smart. When displaying the Grand Teleportation technique, he had held the mountain token in his hand.</p>

  <p>Thus, the moment he exited the space channel, he activated the mountain token, and it immediately created another space channel to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating for even a fraction of a second, Zheng dived head first into the space channel.</p>
