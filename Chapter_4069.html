  <p>
</p>

  <p>Along the borders of the Ruin Graveyard, a flying ship slowly approached.</p>

  <p>As the space beyond the graveyard twisted, the flying ship drilled in without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Actually, the whole Ruin Graveyard was an isolated area from other spaces.</p>

  <p>The divine land lay at anchor at the entrance of the Ruin Graveyard. Once the flying ship entered, it came to a complete stop at the top layer of the divine land.</p>

  <p>From within the divine land, a space channel had been constructed. Seeing that they'd arrived, Luo Xiao came out of the channel to welcome the flying ship.</p>

  <p>A few people exited the flying ship in succession.</p>

  <p>Li Luo and her sister, Li Luoshui, were the last two to come out.</p>

  <p>After being reincarnated, Li Luo was reinstated as a consummate True God again. After she comprehended the Truth of Divine Dao, she eagerly explored the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Overall, her main goal in breaking through in the Sea of Truth was to find a way to enter the real Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard, more warriors relied on the resources of the graveyard which allowed them to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui couldn't care less about this; all she missed were her daughter and son.</p>

  <p>As the journey to the Source World would be difficult and dangerous, she wanted to enter the Other Shore to find them.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui had high hopes for this method. After all, only one Other Shore existed. However, when she asked about the Other Shore, Gu Bei said that entering through the Ruin Graveyard would lead them to the Mysterious Yellow Tower where there were all kinds of Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Still, they wouldn't be able to go to Stage Thirty-three of the real Other Shore.</p>

  <p>This saddened Li Luoshui. If the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Ruin Graveyard couldn't go to the real Other Shore, then perhaps the people of the divine land would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>After Yu Shengfeng had comprehended the Truth of Divine Dao, Li Luoshui instructed him that he must not ring the bell nor enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Once he fused with the Truth of Divine Dao, she asked him to immediately enter the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>To her disappointment, this still didn't work.</p>

  <p>After Yu Shengfeng activated the Truth of Divine Dao, he didn't enter the Sea of Truth. As per Li Luoshui's instructions, he did not ring the bell nor enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower, but he fell into a desolate area of nothing.</p>

  <p>Yu Shengfeng could not move around in the wilderness. Seeing that he had entered the wrong area, he had no choice but to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune and escape.</p>

  <p>After she had asked around, Li Luoshui discovered that all the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard encountered this problem.</p>

  <p>All of them couldn't activate the Truth of Divine Dao to enter the Other Shore. They would only enter the same desolate area Yu Shengfeng fell in.</p>

  <p>Unconvinced, Li Luoshui took her sister, Li Luo, to the outside of the Ruin Graveyard. As a True God, Rose comprehended the Truth of Divine Dao and could be of use to her.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Ruin Graveyard were very strict. Anyone who entered would have a difficult time leaving.</p>

  <p>However, Li Luoshui was an exception.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui took Li Luo to the chaos and instructed her to enter the Other Shore from there.</p>

  <p>Their attempt was not successful. Li Luo still fell into a desolate area just like Yu Shengfeng did.</p>

  <p>The look of frustration across Li Luoshui's face was enough for Luo Xiao to understand what had happened. "Is it still unable to go to the real Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Li Luoshui nodded in disappointment, her eyes looking down.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao stepped forward and gave her an embrace. "Don't worry too much.</p>

  <p>Trust in Luo Zheng's strength..."</p>

  <p>"The Ruin Graveyard is most probably set up by a super master who can even break the rules of the Other Shore. As far as I know, no one in the Source World can do that. If Luo Zheng and Yan don't leave, they would be able to cultivate in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Not only would they be safe from the dangers on the Other Shore, but they would also cultivate faster,"</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui said as she choked on the sobs she had been holding back.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Source World, she knew well how terrifying the real Other Shore was. If one was not careful, they would die. On top of that, it was difficult to advance to a higher level and obtain a stronger Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Notably, the Ruin Graveyard was still a good place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>Though the competition in the graveyard was fierce, the internal competition among the super forces of the Source World was just as intense.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Yellow Tower was even more mysterious. Top-grade Other Shore Tokens could be found there and new tokens were added once in a while.</p>

  <p>These tokens ranged across all stages of the Other Shore, from Stage one to Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Whoever arranged this must have been extremely powerful and outstanding.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui always had a hard time grasping this. Every time she thought of Luo Zheng and Yan, her stomach swirled in regret.</p>

  <p>"Even if the the Mysterious Yellow Tower is a good place, it still lacks one thing Luo Zheng needs," Luo Xiao pointed out.</p>

  <p>"And that is?" asked Li Luoshui.</p>

  <p>"Training." Luo Xiao smiled.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard was in a completely closed status.</p>

  <p>After people reached the Other Shore Realm, they could only spar with each other, resulting in the lack of training.</p>

  <p>They were not as good as the real Other Shore Realm warriors whose combat strengths were much stronger.</p>

  <p>"Should our son train by risking his life?" Li Luoshui was irritated with the idea. "Moreover, the capabilities of the tokens from the Other Shore remain uncertain. It's extremely difficult to obtain a good token there, while every token here is at least at the fourth grade. Even the Nine Li race wouldn't be able to obtain such a token easily during their prosperity period."</p>

  <p>Hearing Li Luoshui's words, Luo Xiao grew silent. He couldn't refute her at this point.</p>

  <p>Respectfully, he kept his mouth shut and listened intently to Li Luoshui.</p>

  <p>Though Li Luoshui tended to go in circles, he nodded and patiently listened to her.</p>

  <p>Li Luo also smiled as she understood her sister's worries.</p>

  <p>However, Li Luo still had great confidence in Luo Zheng. She knew that he wouldn't suffer any loss in the Source World, but she also wondered if he could ever find the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Though the Other Shore Tokens here are easier to obtain, is this really a good thing?" Luo Xiao broke the silence.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard was strange in many ways.</p>

  <p>It did not appear dangerous, but it was quite comparable to the Source World.</p>

  <p>From where they were, the one who'd built the Ruin Graveyard seemed ambitious.</p>

  <p>However, the person never appeared to them.</p>

  <p>Gu Bei and the races of the Ruin Graveyard had little knowledge on the origin of the Ruin Graveyard or who it belonged to. This was a big problem to the human beings in the divine land, and they spent years trying to learn all they could.</p>

  <p>"We shouldn't worry! The Ruin Graveyard favors us," Li Luo said. "I think the owner of the Ruin Graveyard bears no malice towards us!"</p>

  <p>"I sure hope so," Luo Xiao nodded.</p>

  <p>He was not optimistic about it.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Holy Beings in the divine land had the same worry.</p>

  <p>There had never been free resources in the world. On top of that, after the divine land entered the graveyard. many changes occurred.</p>

  <p>For example, every time the talents of the human race entered the Water Drop Cave, they obtained more water to drip into their bodies. In the Sword Graveyard, the human race obtained more light of comprehension for their swordsmanship compared to the others.</p>

  <p>All of this evoked jealousy of alien races around the graveyard. There was even a time when the alien races joined forces to expel the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, just as the alien races made their move, a bad omen washed over the Ruin Graveyard. The graveyard punished the alien races, sending them all to hiding. After that, no race ever dared to make an enemy of the human race again.</p>
