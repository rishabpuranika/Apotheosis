  <p>
</p>

  <p>He made a detour from the side of the Dragon Path and went to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>News had been sent back to the seven mountains about the members of the Bearing race attacking the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barriers of the arrays in the seven mountains had been opened, but the disciples of the major sword sects were still panicking.</p>

  <p>In the Flow Sword Sect</p>

  <p>Trish, dressed in white, flew along the road between the yards. She gently pushed the door of a house open and found Yudie walking up to her and asking with concern, "How's it going?"</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race had attacked suddenly. Zheng had been afraid that Yudie and the others would be worried about him, which was why he hadn't gone up the mountain when he had made his way to the North Unicorn Province from the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>It was quite a while before Yudie got the news that the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace were fighting, and that Zheng had joined the Oneness Guards to fight the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Yudie was worried about Zheng. But after having gone through so much with Zheng, she knew that Zheng was able to resolve the crisis. She believed that Zheng would return safely.</p>

  <p>"The situation is not looking good," said Trish.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Yudie asked, her heart sinking.</p>

  <p>Trish hesitated before saying, "Word is that Emperor Charm has employed the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy in the North Unicorn Province and burned everything in the province to ashes."</p>

  <p>Those who had escaped through the transmission array had relayed this news. After the transmission array was destroyed, they had thought that the North Mysterious City had been burned to ashes and that the seven mountains' powerful warriors had died in the process.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy?" Yudie's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Trish nodded and said, "That's Emperor Charm's theurgy. I'm afraid it's very difficult for Mr. Luo..."</p>

  <p>On hearing the terrifying rumor, Trish thought that Zheng might have died in the North Unicorn Province along with the other powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng was powerful, but his growth and progress in such a short period of time was limited. Even the strong warriors like Athemar and Pearce had died in the North Unicorn Province. It was far-fetched, according to her, that could Zheng escape.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I see," Yudie said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Trish noticed that Yudie was calm. She knew that Yudie had a deep, close relationship with Zheng, which was why she found Yudie's calmness at the news so strange.</p>

  <p>Yudie was worried, but in the past many years, she had never seen Zheng fear fire.</p>

  <p>If the scorching suns had really burned them, the others wouldn't have survived. But Zheng's chances of survival were very high.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that another woman in purple walked over to them and asked in a rather hurried tone, "Trish, do you have any news about my husband?"</p>

  <p>The purple clothed woman was Edna. Zheng had released her from his inner world and allowed her to live in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had become Zheng's Inner-world Generating Avatar, but Edna was still very concerned about the Evil God.</p>

  <p>According to her, as long as the Evil God didn't betray Zheng, there would be a bright future for him.</p>

  <p>The women in the yard had seen the Evil God before, and they all had an instinctive aversion towards him. That was why they disliked Edna. Trish glared coldly at Edna and said, "He's a nobody. How would I know anything about him? He might have died in the North Unicorn Province."</p>

  <p>Edna's shoulder trembled at Trish's answer, her eyes brimming with tears.</p>

  <p>She forced a smile and turned around.</p>

  <p>Margaret looked down at them when she was standing on the second floor, and heard everything that Trish had just said.</p>

  <p>Margaret would have cried bitterly in the past at such bad news.</p>

  <p>But with her pregnancy, she had become calmer. She had begun to do everything according to Zheng's instructions. All for the baby in her belly.</p>

  <p>She paled a little, pursing her lips. But she forced herself to calm down, her expression returning to normal. She believed that Zheng would come back.</p>

  <p>Not long after Trish arrived, the ground began to suddenly shake.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>A dragon-shaped lightning exploded in the distance, seeming to cut heaven and earth in half.</p>

  <p>Even a colossal thing like the Oneness Mountain began to shake. It looked like a giant beast trying to shake off the lice on its body.</p>

  <p>Margaret was agile. She had been leaning against the fence to stare at the lightning which came from behind the Flow Sword Sect. It wasn't hard to guess that it came from the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Mountain, especially the Phoenix Palace, the core of the Oneness Sky Palace, was on high alert. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was protected in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>If the intruders were to attack and kill him, the Oneness Sky Palace would lose its biggest support.</p>

  <p>More than sixty people floated above the white mist, led by an old man carrying a fishing rod.</p>

  <p>A man with red hair had just released the lightning. Many bolts of lightning were still moving in the man's palms like small insects. He smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Master Ware, you met with no resistance on your way here. But this white mist is now stopping you. I wasn't expecting this!"</p>

  <p>This man was called Hancock Zhu and he was the brother of one of the Five-element Emissaries from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Ware glared at Hancock Zhu and sneered, "The previous arrays are powerful, but their techniques aren't that great. Breaking them is cakewalk for me. The Primitive Illusion in front of us was personally set up by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Breaking it isn't that easy."</p>

  <p>When Hancock Zhu had launched a series of punches at the Primitive Illusion, Ware felt the hate bubble up within him. He thought that he was just another vulgar man. If Hancock Zhu hadn't had a brother who was one of the Five-element Emissaries, he wouldn't have been qualified enough to stand together with Ware.</p>

  <p>Ware shook the fishing rod, sneering disdainfully at Hancock Zhu. The thin, long fishing line had already disappeared into the mist.</p>

  <p>"The Primitive Illusion is arranged using the eighteen pillars of the Primitive Temple. If we can't find the eighteen pillars before entering the illusion, we could be trapped inside for life," Ware said, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Oneness Sky Palace had been on good terms with the Sun Crow race. Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm had had a close, friendly relationship, and treated each other as brothers. Some secrets weren't secret to the two races, which gave Ware the confidence to break the array.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Phoenix Palace was panicking.</p>

  <p>The lightning that had descended from the sky was enough to prove the strength of the opponent.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it was not that easy to break the Primitive Illusion. The lightning had fallen outside the Phoenix Palace, but the palace itself was not damaged.</p>

  <p>But could the Primitive Illusion really block the powerful warriors?</p>

  <p>Most of them despaired.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of guards guarding the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>Over a thousand golden armored guards stood guard on the outermost layer.</p>

  <p>Most of these golden armored guards were only as powerful as the five-star Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>Flamine stood before the palace gate, knowing that once the Phoenix Palace was destroyed, these golden armored guards would be nothing more than cannon fodder.</p>

  <p>She raised her head, her eyes easily piercing through the layers of white mist and falling on the strong warriors of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"They split into two groups. The first group went to capture the North Unicorn Province, while the second group came to attack the Bloom Divine Province..." Flamine sighed.</p>

  <p>This was not a complicated strategy.</p>

  <p>When the Oneness Sky Palace fell short of soldiers and generals, it would have no power to fight back against the joint attack of several large races.</p>

  <p>"What should we do if the powerful warriors come in? How about we move Eastern Emperor Taiyi away from here?" Jean paced back and forth in panic.</p>
