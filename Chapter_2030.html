  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's me."</p>

  <p>A satisfied smirk made its way to Nathan's face as he looked at Connie, the spear in his hand trembling slightly.</p>

  <p>The war had already escalated to the point where the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe had become stagnant under Maha's oppressive reign.</p>

  <p>Not even the many Supreme Lords or Master Feng had any ideas to change the situation. The Sacred race now held an absolute advantage over them. There was no way they could ruin Maha's schemes!</p>

  <p>However, the final battle with the Sacred race would commence if the Supreme Lords took action. It was just that the Celestial Position wasn't confident enough to face the indomitable Sacred race.</p>

  <p>After a long time of discussion, they finally decided to just send Nathan and hope for the best.</p>

  <p>Nathan cultivated the Truth Divine Dao and had deeply comprehended it already. If he could kill Maha, it would be enough to help buy some precious time for the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The soles of Maha's boots scuffed against the rough ground as he left his hill. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and turned around. "Huh, a group of cunning old fellows want to test my strength?" he said with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>Nathan felt Maha's gaze and the tip of the spear, which was originally pointed downwards shook slightly. It gently cut through the air with a soft swoosh followed by a flash of light. After that, the spear was already aimed straight at Maha.</p>

  <p>It was just a casual way of provoking. However, Maha felt his chest hurt slightly when the spear was pointed at him!</p>

  <p>The right side of Maha's chest was his equivalent of Achilles' heel. His father had been careless back then when he had refined the physical body for him, so his body had such a flaw. He didn't expect that Nathan would be able to see through it at first glance!</p>

  <p>"Interesting?" Maha said lowly with narrowed eyes. He immediately became cautious. It seemed that aside from Luo Luo Zheng, the other Godly Geniuses weren't bad either. He had underestimated the Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe before.</p>

  <p>However, Maha did not choose to interfere. Since Nathan wanted to challenge Connie, he could observe for a while.</p>

  <p>The cheers from the Iron Moon City suddenly became louder. It was during such time when the Sacred martial artists had the upper hand. It didn't matter if they were faced with the humans or the ogres; the other races' attempts to fight the Sacred race had mostly ended in failure.</p>

  <p>Those who challenged Maha were all defeated miserably. In any case, trying to do so was like committing suicide.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was understandable that everyone else had now placed their hopes on Nathan.</p>

  <p>"Finally, a Godly Genius appeared. What a pleasant surprise." Connie smiled as she slowly floated in the air, her back as straight as a rod.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap and make your move. I don't have much time to waste on you!" Nathan said flatly.</p>

  <p>If Nathan did not care, so did Connie. Her lips stretched into a toothy smile and she said, "Haven't I already started?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the words died on her mouth, a black bead was quickly shot towards Nathan's face!</p>

  <p>Nathan frowned a little, but he was quick to react. He immediately leaned backwards and fell down.</p>

  <p>The Black Flame Bead instantly exploded the moment Nathan fell. It had a powerful explosion, but Nathan had already escaped.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan suddenly stopped his downward descent. The long spear in his hand spun around gently before it flew towards Connie once again.</p>

  <p>"Is that the best you can do?"</p>

  <p>Connie observed that Nathan evaded her attack instead of facing her head-on and from this, she had a rough estimate of his strength. She thought that this Godly Genius of the Evolutionary Universe was nothing!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh?"</p>

  <p>A small gust of wind blew as Connie waved her hand and threw out more soybean-shaped Black Flame Beads.</p>

  <p>Although the Black Flame Bead wasn't as precious as the Life Sacrificing Bead, it was still considered a rare treasure. Even ordinary Sacred grand world lords couldn't afford to be so wasteful like her, let alone ordinary martial artists. Therefore, the Sacred martial artists thought that what Connie did was like simply using wealth to attack in battles.</p>

  <p>At her last attack however, Nathan did not dodge. It was because with so many black beads coming at him, it was impossible for him to pass through them. He had to either use the Grand Teleportation technique to avoid them, or forcefully break through them.</p>

  <p>But since Nathan came to boost the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe, he clearly did not want to use the Grand Teleportation to escape.</p>

  <p>He looked at the rapidly descending Black Flame Beads and at that moment, a complicated pattern flashed across his eyes. The entire world had changed within his pupils.</p>

  <p>Nathan's cultivation had greatly increased after he came back from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and so had his Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing impressive!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he did not dodge and instead raised his spear and constantly pointed it towards the sky. Within just a single breath, he was able to strike numerous times, and each strike was aimed precisely at the center of the black beads.</p>

  <p>Most warriors who used the spear could do the same attack after they reached the Soul Sea Realm, but the result would be very different.</p>

  <p>Nathan was not like most warriors.</p>

  <p>Black flames were sealed in these Black Flame Beads by using a special technique. Even if the beads had been shattered, the black flames would still erupt.</p>

  <p>Nathan's intensive strikes broke all the black beads, but the black flames didn't explode. This was because Nathan could see through the Black Flame Beads' flaws and when he thrust his spear, he had destroyed the entire Black Flame Beads!</p>

  <p>"Good, I've long heard that Nathan is the number one Godly Genius; he's indeed extraordinarily strong!"</p>

  <p>"Let's see how that Sacred woman will deal with this!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan, kill that Sacred woman!"</p>

  <p>Many people thought that Nathan would undoubtedly win very soon.</p>

  <p>Combined with the fact that Nathan had just shown his extraordinary spear technique, the atmosphere in Iron Moon City became even livelier.</p>

  <p>"The Truth Divine Dao is indeed formidable?" Connie said. She lightly tapped her feet and quickly retreated backwards. She had to avoid Nathan's sharp attacks, then find a chance to attack.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan had no plans to give her a chance. After he had shattered the black beads, he raised his foot and stomped in the air.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>An exploded sound rang out from beneath Nathan's feet. His speed increased by several times and his momentum became even more impressive. Almost no one could see how he moved as he suddenly appeared in front of Connie.</p>

  <p>There was no hint of mercy on Nathan's impassive face. In his eyes, this beautiful girl from the Sacred race was nothing more than lines and dots.</p>

  <p>She was nothing more than a ball of rules!</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>He thrust his spear forward and stabbed at Connie's arm!</p>

  <p>Everyone present were confused. He had a great opportunity to kill her, why didn't he destroy her head with a singly strike? Was he just trying to cripple the woman's hand? Would Nathan still show mercy to a woman from another race at this point? It was truly incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>However, something was off, as Connie's pretty face was now drained of color.</p>

  <p>If he had used any ordinary method, it wouldn't kill Connie even if he destroyed her arm.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan had comprehended the Truth Divine Dao. It was impossible for him to make a mistake when he saw someone's weak points. Even Nathan himself felt it was extremely strange why this woman's weak point was on her right arm. Yet, he didn't have any doubts about what he had seen. Thus, he didn't hesitate the slightest when he thrust his spear out.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>When the spear pierced Connie's right arm, a black bead wrapped in a mass of blood slipped out!</p>

  <p>It turned out that this black bead was her Life Sacrificing Bead!</p>

  <p>She previously had seven of those beads, and each of the beads was able to take a fatal blow for her. When Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the universe, he had shattered four of her Life Sacrificing Beads in a single strike. Connie had learned her lesson, so she hid the remaining three Life Sacrificing Beads in different parts of her body.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan had also discovered that Connie actually had several vital points when he had used the Truth Divine Dao to see through her.</p>

  <p>Thus, Connie had lost a life when he attacked with his spear.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is," he muttered. Although he didn't know where those Life Sacrificing Beads came from, he still understood that if he wanted to kill this woman, he had to destroy the remaining Life Sacrificing Beads!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He didn't think twice any longer and wielded his spear which he aimed at Connie's calf!</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>A fine stream of blood gushed out, and he had shattered another Life Sacrificing Bead.</p>

  <p>It was known that Connie relied on the Life Sacrificing Beads to keep her alive and protect her from death. Now that Nathan had destroyed two of them in row, she was extremely terrified and immediately decided to go all out to fight for her life.</p>

  <p>With gritted teeth, she did a somersault in the air and quickly stretched out her two hands. Then, two sword patterns appeared on her arms.</p>

  <p>Connie was just second to Maha in the Murphy Universe. However, she did not cultivate and instead relied entirely on her treasures during battles. She enjoyed a high status in the Sacred race, and thus possessed numerous powerful treasures. Those two sword patterns were her most powerful trump cards!</p>

  <p>Nathan could feel the powerful Mu Ning from the sword patterns, but he still had no plans to retreat!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A multitude of small unicolor swords spread out from Connie's body.</p>

  <p>They formed a storm and surrounded Nathan.</p>

  <p>At that point, Nathan's eyes glowed intensely like a pair of twinkling stars. Whenever he exerted his full strength, the Law Spear Strike also worked to its limit.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>There was nothing else on Nathan's mind now. He only had one goal, and that was to kill Connie first!</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard a voice filled with sinister magic.</p>

  <p>"Stop! That's enough!"</p>

  <p>The loud voice made both Connie and Nathan feel some sort of controlled.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the lower level warriors from the Iron Moon City almost instinctively felt their legs weaken, and they simultaneously knelt on the ground.</p>
