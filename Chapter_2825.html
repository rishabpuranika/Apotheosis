<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's huge body was smashed and thrown into the air.</p>

  <p>The others immediately retreated to the distance.</p>

  <p>Regardless if they were hit by Luo Zheng's huge body or by the shadows, they would surely be killed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still didn't look hurt.</p>

  <p>Even No. 9527 wasn't able to confirm the state of Luo Zheng's body right now. The golden light shone from the surface of his body, but No. 9527 also wasn't sure which kind of Truth of Divine Dao it belonged to.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had found a rule.</p>

  <p>In the past, a trace of primordial energy was being produced when his weapon body was refined, and it actually was from the power of the weapon refiner during the process.</p>

  <p>Now, as he continuously endured the attacks from the shadows, his physical body seemed to absorb a portion of the power and bounce some power back.</p>

  <p>The golden light that radiated from his body seemed to be the power that bounced back.</p>

  <p>"But I can't bounce all the power back."</p>

  <p>The shadows seemed endless. It seemed that the only way to have Nicholas stop was for them to break Luo Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Zheng could withstand these attacks, but after a while, he started to feel a slight pain. His physical body started to ache, and his Wild God body showed signs of instability.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The loud sound echoed as the shadows and his physical body collided.</p>

  <p>Everyone was left dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' endless shadows left them wide-eyed, as much as Luo Zheng's ability to withstand it with his extraordinary strength.</p>

  <p>Comparing each shadow to a full blow from a Holy Being, Luo Zheng had so far received over a hundred blows from a Holy Being. However, he appeared to remain unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Could it be because of the True Demon Body he has inherited?" Greedy expressions started reflecting on the spectators' faces.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! The True Demon Body only releases red lotus flowers and controls energy. Luo Zheng's physical body is extremely terrifying in the first place."</p>

  <p>"How can he be so powerful? Isn't he just a consummate True God? What kind of Divine Dao has he cultivated to such an extent?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember? Luo Zheng had been engulfed by the red lotus flowers but he wasn't burnt to death. If you could survive the flames of red lotus flowers, you would have such a strong body too!"</p>

  <p>Though some people couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng ended up so powerful, they were smart enough to figure out what happened just by observing.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another two huge shadows slammed into Luo Zheng's chest, as he was pushed forward and rolled over.</p>

  <p>The shadows being controlled by Nicholas were extremely flexible, and even Luo Zheng had difficulty avoiding them. As the two shadows attacked him at the same time, he only felt a sharp pain in his chest.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>He spat out a large mouthful of blood, which then turned into golden raindrops fluttering in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>After he used up his Wild God Power, his figure shrank to normal size in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Nicholas felt satisfied.</p>

  <p>The endless appearance of the shadows consumed most of his energy.</p>

  <p>However, they both tried to hold for as long as they could. Apparently, Luo Zheng couldn't hold for too long.</p>

  <p>"You really have an amazing body. I take you seriously all the time. But now, you should go to hell!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas finished his remark, one of the huge shadows stretched out and came towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Zheng crushed Murphy in front of Nicholas, and now it was his turn.</p>

  <p>Having dissipated the Wild God Power, Luo Zheng saw the giant hand reaching out to him, but it was too late for him to dodge.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The voice sounded clear as Luo Zheng felt that a space wave came towards him, enveloping him afterwards.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt dizzy. His position had changed and he came to the woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" the woman asked, staring at him.</p>

  <p>She had never shifted her attention away from Luo Zheng from the start.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was in danger, she decided to use Samuel's duplicate to pull him over, helping him avoid the fatal attack.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the shadow he was controlling failed, Nicholas quickly knew what just happened. Looking coldly towards that woman, he said, "You better mind your own business. When I take control of the Abyss Demon Region, I will vanish you in this world."</p>

  <p>As a ferocious creature of the Abyss Demon Region, this woman was capable of reviving countless times. But the master of the Abyss Demon Region can control the fate of the monsters in it.</p>

  <p>"I've already told you how important Luo Zheng is to me, so you shouldn't be surprised that I helped him. How can I be considered a busybody?" the woman uttered with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then die together!" Nicholas reached out to pinch in the air again.</p>

  <p>This time, another huge shadow appeared beside the woman and tried to grab both Luo Zheng and her.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Samuel's duplicate, who was standing behind the woman, immediately acted and shook his spear, creating a space channel for them to enter.</p>

  <p>The shadow ended up missing its target again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all three of them appeared on the other side of the void.</p>

  <p>However, an illusory giant hand grabbed them the moment they appeared.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! I completely forgot that he could see through the future." The expressions on both Luo Zheng's and the woman's faces changed drastically at the same time.</p>

  <p>Nicholas could see the future. But since Luo Zheng could see through Nicholas' memory, he stopped using this method earlier.</p>

  <p>However, when Nicholas made use of it this time, he predicted the location of the three people after employing the Grand Teleportation technique, giving him time to summon the giant shadow in advance. With this move, he made sure that they couldn't avoid his attack this time!</p>

  <p>"Let me resist him," shouted the woman.</p>

  <p>But it was too late. Luo Zheng had stood up already. With a loud sound, Luo Zheng stood in front of the shadowy giant hand, blocking it like an unbreakable pillar.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spat out another mouthful of blood. With his muscles and bones all trembling, his body ached under the great pressure.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's Wild God body was gone, his physical body was still able to emit some of his strength to generate the overbearing golden light.</p>

  <p>However, the golden light was very weak now, perhaps because he had already suffered a lot of attacks earlier. Clearly, it was difficult to destroy the huge shadow!</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Raising his hand, Luo Zheng called out to the woman who was still in a daze.</p>

  <p>As the woman nodded her head, Samuel's duplicate put the Spear of Supreme Harmony horizontally. The three disappeared from the huge palm again.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just like earlier, Nicholas was able to figure out their movement, and a shadow had been condensed in advance, aiming at their position.</p>

  <p>"You go ahead. I know a way to deal with this shadow," Luo Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng could peek into Nicholas' judgment, he couldn't tell the woman to dodge in advance, because telling her would mean a change in the "future". Nicholas would surely pick this up and make corresponding changes to his own attack.</p>
