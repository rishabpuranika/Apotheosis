<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was initially brimming with confidence, but at the sound of the word "death", his face paled.</p>

  <p>"What's the probability of death?" Geoffrey asked in a small voice.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue tilted his head and thought for a moment. "Excluding the people who died long before, about two million people have entered the chimney, but no one has succeeded." He paused for a moment. "If you want me to give you a probability, then the probability is zero."</p>

  <p>"All of them died?" Geoffrey's voice trembled.</p>

  <p>"Yes. They were the elites selected by the six great races. They were the smartest," Elder Xue added.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey fell silent.</p>

  <p>He and Zheng grew up differently. He had grown up in a relaxed, privileged environment, whereas Zheng had faced many challenges. Although he had met some minor setbacks in the past, Geoffrey had never truly dealt with a life-and-death situation before.</p>

  <p>When he heard the severe consequence, his heart was seized by fear.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue said this to see how Geoffrey would react. He continued, "Your father has lost the sword to that humanoid creature. Do you know what we are about to go up against?"</p>

  <p>"An undefeatable opponent," Geoffrey answered.</p>

  <p>"It's not that we can't defeat him, but that we will all die," Elder Xue said seriously.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Geoffrey was even more flustered. After thinking for a moment, he asked, "What about my father? And my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Everything will be downgraded and destroyed, your parents included,"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue said gravely.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey grew even more frantic. "I need to go back! I need to go back to my parents!"</p>

  <p>Since he knew that there was not much time left, he wanted to escape now and be with his loved ones.</p>

  <p>He left them quite a long time ago. He'd be lying if he said he didn't miss them. After all, he'd only left because he thought this'd make for an interesting journey. The things he'd encountered along the way made him realize the seriousness of the matter, which changed his carefree attitude.</p>

  <p>In fact, when Kincaid talked with Geoffrey, he made everything very clear. At the time, Geoffrey learned he had a very important role to play.</p>

  <p>However, Kincaid didn't want to pressure Geoffrey too much, so he only mentioned that the task at hand was important. He didn't say that eventually, all people would have to die.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue, on the other hand, was very blunt. He spared no time in telling him that he would lose his life.</p>

  <p>"Even if you go back, you will still die. Do you have the stomach to watch your parents die like this?" Elder Xue asked, not in a harsh tone.</p>

  <p>He had lived so long that he could read people's minds. Although he had just met Geoffrey, he had already figured out his personality.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was proud, conceited, and couldn't get his mind off play. He didn't have a sense of responsibility, but he was smart and was extraordinarily talented. Elder Xue needed his talent, which was why he went straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"Then, what else can I do?" Geoffrey shouted in frustration.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue gently placed his claw on Geoffrey's shoulder. "Of course, there is a way." He pointed at the chimney with his other claw and said, "Your father has the ancestry-level bloodline, but he needs another thing. Only when he gets this thing can he change the situation. This is the only chance."</p>

  <p>"But if I fail, I will die..." Geoffrey's voice shook, his eyes brimming with tears.</p>

  <p>Like all young men, he had a dream of saving the world and becoming a great hero, but he never expected he'd have to go through such lengths to realize this dream.</p>

  <p>"If you fail, you will die; if you succeed, you can live!" Elder Xue snapped.</p>

  <p>For anyone else? the Treacherous Beings and Eternal Realm warriors who had lived in the chaos for countless years, they would've immediately seen the gravity of the situation, and would've been ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, Ziya, the Bird Masters, and the human spirits all would've cooperated quickly.</p>

  <p>But Geoffrey didn't.</p>

  <p>"I refuse! I want to go back! Send me back to the chaos. I want to see my parents!" Geoffrey whined, burying his face in his hands.</p>

  <p>"You can't go back. You can't even go out of this square. Look at the line under your feet. The second you take a step forward, you will die!" Elder Xue exclaimed, pointing a claw at Geoffrey's feet.</p>

  <p>The square was a forbidden area full of killing intent, and all the creatures could only stay within a certain area to survive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey abruptly took a few steps back and slammed into the wall behind him. He stared at the line in horror, as if staring at the face of the God of Death.</p>

  <p>"This house can only accommodate ten people. If there are eleven people in it, everyone will die. So today, one person has to enter the chimney. Are you willing to be this person?" Elder Xue locked eyes with him fiercely.</p>

  <p>"No! I won't go!" Geoffrey wailed.</p>

  <p>He was overwhelmed with despair.</p>

  <p>"If no one goes, we will all die together. Do you want that to happen?"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue pressed him further.</p>

  <p>"I won't go!" Geoffrey continued to resist.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled ruefully. Ignoring Geoffrey's wails, he turned around and gestured towards the others.</p>

  <p>All of these members of the Elemental race were trained by Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Like the little monster before, they had no intention of leaving alive since they entered this place and were willing to sacrifice their lives for their own race.</p>

  <p>One of them stepped forward and stood before the green lines.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue then said to Geoffrey, "There are supposed to be only ten people here." He pointed at the figure standing before the green lines.</p>

  <p>"But because of you, he has to die. Although he is a non-human creature, he also has parents, brothers, and is unwilling to leave this world.</p>

  <p>However, for the sake of the entire Elemental race, he is willing to sacrifice himself."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey feebly watched as the member of the Elemental race walked along the two crooked green lines towards the center of the huge square, until he disappeared within the chimney.</p>

  <p>A green light appeared on the side of the chimney. It climbed up, bit by bit, along the chimney. Ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet...</p>

  <p>When the green light came to one third of the chimney, it suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a red light.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue closed his eyes. With a pained expression, he said regretfully,</p>

  <p>"He's dead."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey stared at the chimney in a daze. After a while, he finally reacted.</p>

  <p>"So soon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Elder Xue nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Elemental race stood up and put their fists on their chests in silence.</p>

  <p>They had witnessed this scene so many times before, but they could never get used to it. Their hearts overflowed with sadness, although they stood in silence.</p>

  <p>"If that thing is so difficult to get, why do you even try?" Geoffrey asked huffily.</p>

  <p>"The same reason as yours. If we don't get it, and it's obtained by other races, the Elemental race will perish." Elder Xue shrugged.</p>

  <p>The gaps between races could not be closed, and the law of the jungle was absolutely in control of everything here.</p>

  <p>After saying that, Elder Xue turned around abruptly and entered the oval building.</p>

  <p>From the moment he saw Geoffrey, Elder Xue knew that his chance had finally come.</p>

  <p>He had waited here for so long, but in the end, the Elemental race was unable to produce a member talented enough for the task. However, now the Deep Space had sent Geoffrey here.</p>

  <p>He deliberately put a lot of pressure on Geoffrey. Only in this way could he trigger Geoffrey's sense of responsibility.</p>

  <p>Now that he had given Geoffrey enough pressure, the rest was up to Geoffrey himself.</p>
