<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3324 How Dare You </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact plunged down from the top of the tower, followed by the two black monkeys chasing after it. Then, a hairy hand suddenly caught it.</p>

  <p>The owner of this large hand was a one-eyed monster, from another powerful force in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey..."</p>

  <p>The one-eyed monsters lurked in the dark, just like the black monkeys did.</p>

  <p>They had been observing everything that happened in the Green Jade City.</p>

  <p>When they watched the black monkeys rush into the scene, they too rushed over anxiously.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that as soon as they entered the Green Jade City, they saw something, flickering green light, falling down. It was a sheer coincidence that one of their members caught the mysterious falling object.</p>

  <p>This one-eyed monster was overjoyed. In its excitement, it didn't even take the time to study the object up close. Instead, it just cried, "I've got it! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the monsters cheered and then followed closely behind. In no time, they dashed towards the outside of the Green Jade City.</p>

  <p>"Stop there! One-eyed guy! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Watching the one-eyed monsters recede in the distance, the two black monkeys cursed in fury.</p>

  <p>The three black monkeys were the elites stationed in the Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. They had fostered a good working relationship with each other. But now, one of them had lost its life, only for their prize to be stolen by a herd of savage one-eyed monsters! How could they possibly be willing to accept that?</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Golden light flashed on the pieces of yellow paper on the two black monkeys. Jumping down from the tower like two shooting stars, they let fury fill their beady eyes as they chased after the one-eyed monsters.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, too, was furious. It had taken him a great deal to get his hands on that Civilization Artifact. But now, it had been taken away by others.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge! We must go after them!"</p>

  <p>Dragging Feng Ge by the arm, he leapt off the tower.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had little interest in the Civilization Artifact. She didn't even know what that thing meant. However, seeing Luo Zheng go after it like a madman, she felt like she wanted whatever Luo Zheng wanted.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the two black monkeys were steadily closing in on the one-eyed monsters. On a normal basis, the two group were of the same strength.</p>

  <p>However, with the Sanskrit words written on the yellow papers, the black monkeys' power was strengthened greatly.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, the two black monkeys caught up to the one-eyed monsters.</p>

  <p>"Fight them! Now!"</p>

  <p>The one-eyed monsters weren't stupid. They could tell that whatever they had caught back at the tower was extremely valuable. They were definitely willing to fight for it.</p>

  <p>Two one-eyed monsters suddenly stopped running, and turned to face the monkeys. A strange symbol lit up in each of their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Cut and lock!"</p>

  <p>The token of the one-eyed monster was all in the eye. As the symbols flashed in their eyes, the space in their sight was cut apart, forming a space cage that enveloped the two black monkeys.</p>

  <p>"A space cage. Big deal!"</p>

  <p>One of the black monkeys dashed forward. As it collided with the space cage, hairline cracks crawled around the walls of the space cage. In an instant, the cage was smashed with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The other black monkey planted its foot on the shoulder of the one in front of it, and then launched itself into the air, kicking one of the one-eyed monsters with astounding strength.</p>

  <p>"Hand it over, or I'll eat you!" a black monkey threatened.</p>

  <p>These black monkeys were extremely barbaric in the Dark Region and ate almost anything, including one-eyed monsters.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a mysteriously colored halo appeared in the monster's eye.</p>

  <p>As the halo flickered, the black monkey stopped in its tracks. It seemed to be bewitched by the mysterious halo.</p>

  <p>While the black monkey was in a trance, the one-eyed monster tossed the Civilization Artifact to one of its companions.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge caught up to them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge wrinkled her nose in disgust as soon as her eyes landed on these creatures of the Dark Region. Anger surging within her, she decided right then and there she would spare them no mercy.</p>

  <p>"Great Sanskrit Light!"</p>

  <p>A ray of light circled around Feng Ge's slender fingers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had witnessed the power of the Great Sanskrit Light before.</p>

  <p>Although it had no effect on a creature like Luo Zheng who was not from the Dark Region, the Great Sanskrit Light could cause a terrifying blow to anything in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Just as Feng Ge was about to cast out the Great Sanskrit Light, the Civilization Artifact flying in the air suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" The voice of the Green Jade Spirit boomed, echoing in the air. It didn't say to the black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters, but Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, however, didn't listen.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng reached out and grabbed Feng Ge's hand, just in the nick of time. "Hold on," he said.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit was well aware of the terrifying power of a purified being in the Dark Region. An ordinary ray of light could even cause the Green Jade City full of bumps and hollows. The Great Sanskrit Light could directly melt down a portion of it!</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the Green Jade City had the power to repair itself, it still would've taken a lot of energy to do so.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Green Jade Spirit was quite anxious.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys and one-eye monsters were stunned. Of course, they never expected the Civilization Artifact would have its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Who gave you the right to steal from the Green Jade City?"</p>

  <p>The dignified voice of the Green Jade Spirit boomed again.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys and one-eyed monsters, of course, knew that the Green Jade City wasn't a place to be trifled with. However, they still scrambled to their feet in an attempt to snatch something.</p>

  <p>Just as the Green Jade Spirit finished speaking, the entire Green Jade City seemed to come to life.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, various jade creatures emerged from the Green Jade City---from Green Jade Bugs to Green Jade Beasts, among many others.</p>

  <p>Each of these creatures was a force to be reckoned with. A single Green Jade Beast had almost killed all the pig-faced monsters and even ate up the octopuses, which didn't have any predators within the Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>But now, hundreds of thousands of them suddenly emerged.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the two black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters were devoured by the swarm of jade creatures.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng felt fear as he watched the city suddenly come to life with formidable beasts. Feng Ge, on the other hand, watched fearlessly.</p>

  <p>After all, no matter how many jade creatures came for her, she could destroy them all with just a single beam of light.</p>

  <p>After finishing off the creatures from the Dark Region, those jade creatures glanced at Luo Zheng indifferently, and then melted back into the Green Jade City, as though nothing happened.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had settled back into their original places, Luo Zheng approached the Civilization Artifact and picked it up. "Didn't you say that all the members of your race have fallen into a deep sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Hump... They are not qualified to be regarded as my members," the Green Jade Spirit said indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit, after all, was once the Son of Truth---a Chaos Ancient God! Those it regarded as members of its race must have been masters of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng once again tucked away the Civilization Artifact into Feng Ge's space ring, and together, they headed out. The two of them were walking along the road to the outside of the Green Jade City, when suddenly, the ground beneath their feet began to tremble.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The huge Green Jade City began to sink, and the black soil started flowing towards the center. Meanwhile, the black mud flowed back, forming a large, black pool.</p>
