</p>

  <p>As the downgrader floated in the chaos, his six pairs of compound eyes shone a bright, flashing orange. He sized up Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Zheng noticed the downgrader, he was not threatened at all. If anything, he merely mocked him with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's heart sank as he heard the downgrader's words. It seemed that he did not care about the death of the Snake Spirit King, which was not a good sign.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that I can't control the primitive land by devouring it directly.</p>

  <p>When a large primitive land devours a small one, this leaves the two controllers to have the same power. The Snake Spirit King is really a good-for-nothing bastard.</p>

  <p>You must have known this secret and made plans accordingly," the downgrader nagged. "But because you were born in this chaos, you have limited knowledge. I can only assume that someone from the Bold Conjecture House told you this."</p>

  <p>The downgrader always had a better understanding of nature than anyone else. With ease, he could quickly come up with the most accurate guesses and answers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng intently stared into the black light as he felt a great pressure of energy from it.</p>

  <p>When he was in the Jade Pure Realm, he hadn't known the downgrader well. However, he had enough confidence to put up a fight against the downgrader and almost win. Now that Kincaid had woken up and Geoffrey had returned with the Heavenly Ring Staff, he gradually realized that the downgrader was more complex than he seemed.</p>

  <p>Even if he disposed of the Snake Spirit King, it seemed that everything was still in the palm of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"So what?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Your resistance is notable and surprises me, but the effort you make is in vain," the downgrader pointed out.</p>

  <p>"In vain?" Zheng's eyebrows ruffled as he pulled himself together. "Don't forget that I am now the owner of the Burial Land. I also have the Extreme Form energies of the Deep Space while you are all alone!"</p>

  <p>It seemed that Zheng had the upper hand and he shouldn't fear the downgrader any more.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The downgrader roared with frightening cackles and shrieks. "Your present struggle reminds me so much of the Sacred Spirit race. They were born as indestructible stone tablets. Would you like to guess how they planned to defeat me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the ground, not saying a word.</p>

  <p>The downgrader nodded and continued, "They united as one and grew together to form a huge stone cage that trapped me within. It's a pity you weren't able to witness it. It was truly an unprecedented big move. Though the power of the sixth-grade world is far weaker compared to that of the seventh-grade and eighth-grade worlds, they were persistent and determined all throughout, which resulted to a very cruel ending."</p>

  <p>"What... What happened to them?" Zheng couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they turned from stone tablets to tombstones. Hahaha!" The downgrader let out a merciless laugh. "When I injured Clarence in the fifth-grade world, I won. That says a lot, because in this world, only Clarence can stop me. And you, you're just materials and tools. All brawn and no brain."</p>

  <p>"We still have our own intelligence," Zheng defended with his eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't." The downgrader looked down and shook his head. "Your intelligence is too low. Undeniably, it is impressive that you have reached this point, but like I said before, you are all tools. Without Clarence, you are nothing. You have no idea how funny it is to see you explore the chaos like chickens with their heads cut off," he said with a tone of revulsion, as if Zheng's small, shallow understanding disgusted him.</p>

  <p>"Without Clarence, we can also win. Otherwise, why did you attach yourself to the Snake Spirit King all these years?" Zheng retorted. He was definitely not going to back down on such argument.</p>

  <p>"Clarence lost his memory in the Deep Space while I lost my strength.</p>

  <p>Since then, it became extremely difficult for me to downgrade the worlds." As he spoke, he stretched out his slender arms and the parts of the irregular heavy sword appeared one by one, slowly piecing themselves together. "Now that I've regained my strength, everything is different." He smiled, "Let me show you how to properly use this weapon."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, the cracks across the heavy sword began to flicker with a bright light.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the light was not monochrome; it was colorful.</p>

  <p>Within the sword, various Extreme Form energies quickly switched around.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng felt a sudden change within the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>"Troubled Creatures!"</p>

  <p>Before, when the Snake Spirit King used black vortexes to get rid of the outer wall of the primitive land, he ordered the Troubled Creatures to attack. That was when a vast number of Troubled Creatures swarmed to the primitive land from all directions, attacking left and right.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's primitive land had expanded a lot. This brought about a long distance between the outer wall to the Pear Hill and the Ruin Graveyard in the center. It would take the Troubled Creatures quite a long time to get there.</p>

  <p>Once he controlled the Burial Land, Zheng ignored the Troubled Creatures so they safely continued to fly in the void.</p>

  <p>If one looked closely from the farthest corner of the Burial Land, they would easily spot a number of Troubled Creatures huddled together like a black ball as they moved towards the center.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, blue bands of light appeared on the bodies of the Troubled Creatures. Simultaneously, their bodies increased in size as the black ball moved even quicker than before.</p>

  <p>Realizing that something was wrong, Zheng appeared in the center of the Burial Land and immediately sent a message as the controller. "All of you, return! Now!"</p>

  <p>Because the Troubled Creatures were born in the Burial Land, they were completely under Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>The creatures were determined to get to their goal and quickened their pace. However, the moment they heard Zheng's message, they stopped in their tracks and flowed backwards. The ball they formed expanded as they made their way back.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Just then, black flames appeared at the center of the Burial Land too. With the irregular heavy sword in his hand, the downgrader roared his order,</p>

  <p>"Kill everything you see! That is an order!"</p>

  <p>When the Troubled Creatures heard this, they roared once again and charged forward. At the hands of the downgrader, they actually disobeyed Zheng's order without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The downgrader looked at Zheng with a grin across his face. "Look how weak your power is. What kind of controller are you?" he mocked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened at the downgrader's words. "These Troubled Creatures can't withstand even a single blow. What is it to you if you can control them?"</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Zheng released a thousand avatars.</p>

  <p>When he'd used an avatar before, the avatar wiped out a hundred million Troubled Creatures. Though the creatures were enormous, they were still considerably weak in battle.</p>

  <p>This time was different, and it went beyond any of Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>As one of the avatars rushed towards the Troubled Creatures, he released invisible blades from his body. However, before the blades approached the Troubled Creatures, their bodies fluctuated. They charged and tore the avatar into pieces.</p>

  <p>Likewise, they did the same to the other avatars before them. Within seconds, all the avatars were ripped apart by the Troubled Creatures, which puzzled Zheng even more. His best counterattack stood absolutely no chance.</p>

  <p>"I made a few light changes to them. Do you like it?" the downgrader said, smiling down at Zheng.</p>
