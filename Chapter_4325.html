  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Elder Xue sent Luo Nian away, he had been very upset all this time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he couldn't return to the main world, which meant he had no chance to meet his friends again.</p>

  <p>However, though Elder Xue hoped that Luo Nian would bring someone here, he did not expect that it would be so soon.</p>

  <p>"We were both loyal to the Four Spirits Sect but we had a disagreement. Is that something to be ashamed of?" Elder Xue asked as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile spread across Hilario's face. "It was not a mere disagreement. Master Kincaid and I chose a path that was a dead end, and this led to the destruction of the Four Spirits Sect." He looked down at his feet. "How can I just forget this?"</p>

  <p>"Let bygones be bygones..." As Elder Xue spoke, he put an arm around Hilario and looked at the people behind him. "Where is our king?"</p>

  <p>Hilario's soft smile turned into a frown once again. "He passed away."</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?" Elder Xue asked as his body stiffened.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Because Luo Nian successfully brought these people to the Deep Space, everything should have gone smoothly. As a Treacherous Being, Kincaid had no flaws except for his coordinates. Killing him would be no easy task.</p>

  <p>Hilario sighed and did not speak a word.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Elder Xue stepped back as he sensed something had gone wrong.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng moved forward and cupped his hands before Elder Xue. "Elder Xue, I'm  Luo Zheng Luo. Luo Nian is my son."</p>

  <p>Though Elder Xue had never seen Luo Zheng, he had learned much about him through Luo Nian. It was Luo Zheng he'd chosen for the plan and for fusing with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you've given me a great fortune but I still failed in the end," Luo Zheng said as he still looked down in defeat. He shook his head in shame, not wanting to make any eye contact with Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>This was the first time they met each other. Standing before him was the man who changed his life.</p>

  <p>Since the page had been burnt, Luo Zheng's fate had forever been linked to the entire world. The person responsible for this was Elder Xue, but unfortunately, Elder Xue's plan never followed through.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elder Xue stretched out his hands and placed them on Luo Zheng's head. "As the saying goes, man proposes and fate disposes. You have gone through great trials to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline and save Master Kincaid. You have not failed, son."</p>

  <p>"But the world is being destroyed!" Luo Zheng said with a bitter smile. He then told Elder Xue what happened after Luo Nian brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff, from the main world to the chaos, and from the end to the downgrading. Once he finished, he fixed his stance and with a calm expression said, "This is all my fault. I'm not here to visit you. In all honesty, I led everyone to escape here."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue's eyes widened as he heard Luo Zheng's confession. However, he almost immediately relaxed and a smile followed after. "The downgrading cannot be stopped. This is the fate of all living beings. Why must you put it all on yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Right," Hilario echoed from behind. "You were not defeated by the downgrading but by the rules. We have no choice but to accept it."</p>

  <p>As they discussed, a few members of the Elemental race ran over. They pointed towards one direction and muttered all at the same time in a panic.</p>

  <p>As Elder Xue tried to understand what was going on, he looked in the direction they pointed at. Just then, a magnificent blue arc slowly shot up into the sky from the bottom of the space, and massive chunks of rocks eroded as it passed.</p>

  <p>"That... That is the expanding Wall World?" asked Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at it then turned to him. "Yes. The Wall World is about to expand to this place. Elder Xue, I would like to ask you to enter the Immortal Mansion and go with us."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Elder Xue shook his head and said, "You may leave. I'll stay here."</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, please go with us! You'll be downgraded if you stay here,"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian couldn't help but chip in.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled and looked at Luo Nian with kind eyes. "Good boy. I have lived many, many years. It means nothing to me to have more hours or less."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian scratched his head. "I guess you're right."</p>

  <p>No one even attempted to persuade Elder Xue. They all knew that they'd come to a dead end.</p>

  <p>In the Immortal Mansion, all of the people had got rid of their lifespan shackles long ago, but they couldn't seem to shake the shackles of the world.</p>

  <p>They returned to the Immortal Mansion and set off on their journey once again.</p>

  <p>After the Immortal Mansion left, Elder Xue spoke to the members of the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>He asked them to hold a sacrificial ceremony and invited them all to attend.</p>

  <p>The members of the Elemental race looked to Elder Xue as a precious, symbolic figure. At the moment they heard his words, they rushed to prepare the ceremony. Not knowing what it was for, they blindly followed his orders merely because he was Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Once the ceremony was prepped and all the members were gathered together, Elder Xue chanted in their language, "The gate of the Heaven is coming soon. It will guide us to the pure land of joy, where there is no pain or dispute, and all living creatures are equal..."</p>

  <p>As they heard his words, the creatures gasped and flailed in joy. "Where is the gate of the Heaven?" asked one of them.</p>

  <p>"That's it," Elder Xue exclaimed, pointing to the distance.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, the blue arc arrived at tremendous speed. The members of the Elemental race were so immersed in the mesmerizing scenery Elder Xue described that it took them a while to realize what came towards them. Before they knew it, they were all mutilated.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Once the Wall World expanded to the Deep Space, its speed increased even more.</p>

  <p>A huge part of the ground was destroyed as the Sky Wheel City began to be downgraded. Within only a few minutes, the entire city was completely downgraded.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the broken relics and the ring-shaped sun that hung in the sky of the Deep Space were downgraded as well.</p>

  <p>If one looked from afar, the Deep Space resembled a flat cone. Though the downgrader broke many of its parts when it was downgraded before, not much of its cone-like structure had changed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Immortal Mansion continued to rise along the axis of the cone.</p>

  <p>When it reached its peak, it abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>"We can't seem to go up any further," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked up to the sky as if on command. Each and every world had a boundary, and the boundary of the Deep Space was hovering about eighty feet above them. It floated there like a translucent layer of gray soil.</p>

  <p>This was as far as they could go.</p>

  <p>"Dad, what do you think is outside the Deep Space?" Luo Nian asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"My son, even Clarence can't seem to answer that," replied Luo Zheng with a smile and a nudge to his son's head.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you try to break it?" Luo Nian asked again but this time, with his fists clenched. He also knew that this was almost impossible to do, but he was convinced that they should have a try.</p>

  <p>"I guess we can have a go."</p>

  <p>But just as Luo Zheng finished speaking, a black light rapidly rose from below and then slowed down its pace as it neared the Immortal Mansion. It was the black ship controlled by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>This was not a surprise to any of them, for the Evil God was unfamiliar with the main world and the Deep Space. He moved around aimlessly as he was chased by the Wall World, and finally, he found himself at the top of the Deep Space just like everybody else.</p>
