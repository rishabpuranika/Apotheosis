  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength was not enough. He had a much longer way to go before being able to protect Xun.</p>

  <p>Hence, the fact that she was hiding within his body was a secret that could not be revealed.</p>

  <p>Once Yao found out, there would be an endless pursuit for Xun.</p>

  <p>She would not give her even a moment's peace. It had already been quite some time since Xun had left her throne. It was impossible for her current subordinates to face Yao.</p>

  <p>Now was not the time to disclose this secret.</p>

  <p>However, when the blood-red Faith Energy refracted on Luo Zheng's body, the secret was bound to be out.</p>

  <p>Rumble... rumble... rumble...</p>

  <p>Under the malicious Aura's control, Lincoln relentlessly attacked the golden-haired woman's three-colored light barrier like a rabid beast.</p>

  <p>In her distraction, the golden-haired woman had already forgotten to retaliate. Her eyes were fixed on Luo Luo Zheng, her forehead creased in confusion.</p>

  <p>"My queen? Why did the light refract on a man? What's going on?" she mumbled.</p>

  <p>Outside the underground palace, the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place watched, her doubtful expression becoming more serious by the second. "Our queen has been missing for a long time. It seems that she has been in the body of this human warrior!"</p>

  <p>The expressions of the faces of the Saint Lords of the ogres and humans changed more dramatically.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, the two Demon Night queens had been cursing each other with Roaring Tokens. Now, it seemed that the long-missing Queen of Killings had been in this underground palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened. This was a seriously troublesome situation.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The blood-red light vanished as Xun extinguished the Faith Energy from the distant space. The golden-haired woman's three-colored barrier lost its red ray. However, it still held enough power to block Lincoln's attacks.</p>

  <p>It was too late. There was no point in extinguishing the Faith Energy reflected on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Yao's manic laughter resounded.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! I thought our little game of cat and mouse would continue for a little while longer. I hadn't expected to catch you so soon. My, my, Xun. You disappoint me. You turn out to be even more stupid than I thought!" Yao had used the Roaring Token to spread her voice throughout the entire universe. It reached Luo Zheng's and Xun's ears clearly.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the universe now knew that the Queen of Killings of the Demon Night had been found.</p>

  <p>"My queen, where are you?" Supreme Lord Leroy's voice called out, his tone urgent. He was one of the most powerful among Xun's old subordinates, and he had been gathering information on Xun to find her whereabouts. What Yao said caught his attention.</p>

  <p>There was a slight shift in Yolande's expression as she watched from within the Mist Palace. Lowering her head, she muttered, "This is bad."</p>

  <p>This was an internal affair of the Demon Night. Yolande couldn't interfere. Had it been any other matter, it wouldn't have been difficult to involve herself in the conflict.</p>

  <p>However, as it was, the situation was much more complicated. In front of their eyes was a battle between two Demon Night queens, and they had no room or desire for compromise. If Yolande interfered, she would be putting the Supreme Lords of both the Demon Night and the alliance in a perilous position. The situation was delicate? now that a chaotic world had arrived, many of the Supreme Lords were simply lurking in wait for a new round of Heavenly Destiny to unfold. It would be unwise for Yolande to make a move, given the current circumstances.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>'He is far too careless. I can only hope that he can find a way to get away from this trouble, ' she said to herself as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grabbed onto Freya, his eyebrows tightly-knit as he continued to fall. The disclosure of Xun's whereabouts was purely an accident.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected the blonde woman to use the Power of Three Queens. If not for it, her whereabouts wouldn't have been revealed.</p>

  <p>"What next?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. Xun's face had a troubled expression.</p>

  <p>Her mind raced with the dismal possibilities. She answered Luo Luo Zheng, her eyes stern. "Continue to go down. Let's go through the Endless Abyss first!</p>

  <p>We'll think about other problems later!"</p>

  <p>They were in an extremely precarious position.</p>

  <p>Back in Auspice City, Xun had forced Nela into an oath, which would help keep her secret.</p>

  <p>However, she wouldn't succeed in convincing the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place outside the underground palace to do the same. She would not budge, even with her position as the Queen of Killings. The ones at the top always proved to be the craftiest. The Saint Lord knew Xun's position as queen was already teetering on the verge of collapse.</p>

  <p>Now that the Saint Lord had blocked the entrance to the underground palace, nothing but doom awaited them if they attempted to leave the Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't stay here forever. The Endless Abyss would be unable to stop a Saint Lord from entering. What prevented them from forcing their way in were the treasures within the underground palace. They did not know what sort of opportunities the palace held, but forcing their way in could lead to its destruction, and consequently, the loss of the secrets it promised.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng stayed in the Endless Abyss for a time, it would do nothing more than fuel Yao's impatience. Once it reached the end of its tether, she would surely force her way in. It was only a matter of time before more trouble came.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng had no time to pay attention to other martial artists, even Lincoln. He grabbed Freya and moved closer to the abyss' wall. The moment he came into contact with the hard surface, his entire body was propelled sideways as he kicked the wall.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He had kicked upwards, lending more speed to his fall.</p>

  <p>His drop hadn't been slow, but time was of great consequence. He needed to pass through the Endless Abyss as quickly as he could. Both he and Xun were anxious about what happened after, but as of this moment, their descent in the Endless Abyss demanded their attention.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng adjusted his position to get closer to the wall. Repeating his earlier motions, he kicked it again!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Their speed once again increased.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept on following this pattern of shifting and kicking, leaving the frantic warriors farther and farther above.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom ?</p>

  <p>Lincoln had not ceased his attacks on the blond woman's dual-colored light barrier. She was staring blankly at Luo Zheng's figure, which was growing more and more distant with each passing second. She was only a warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm, but the ancient Demon Night blood running in her veins made her far more valuable to the Saint Lord than other higher ranked warriors.</p>

  <p>A warrior with a bloodline like hers was meant to be sent to the core area of the Demon Night to cultivate. However, fate had other plans. She had grown up in the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place and the Saint Lord was kind to her, so she had concealed the truth about her lineage. But after being cornered by Lincoln, she had used the Power of Three Queens. She had not expected it to cause the uncovering of Xun's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>The Roaring Token resounded throughout the universe, and naturally arrived at the blonde woman's ears as well. Two queens stood at the forefront of this battle. A faint emotion of guilt cast over her. She was partly to blame for the impending strife.</p>

  <p>Xun and Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, felt no hatred for the golden-haired woman. She could not have known that Xun was in Luo Zheng's body. The discovery of Xun's whereabouts had been purely a coincidence.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng descended rapidly, the scenery around him once again changed.</p>

  <p>The blood-red walls of the abyss had screamed slaughter a while ago.</p>

  <p>However, at this depth, white specks of light were now gleaming around the walls.</p>

  <p>These lights were from the extremely pure Power of Purification!</p>

  <p>The specks glistened like snowflakes, swirling gracefully in the depths of the abyss and quickly entering Luo Zheng's and Freya's bodies.</p>

  <p>The Power of Purification did not have much of an effect on Luo Luo Zheng. The malicious Mu Ning he absorbed had by now been completely wiped off and sent into the Killing Sword Mountain. However, he felt himself seized by calmness, as if his anxiety was slowly dissipating. The Power of Purification did not only affect one's body but also cleared one's mind.</p>

  <p>As the Power of Purification entered Freya's body, the malicious Mu Ning in her body began to wane rapidly, the red light in her eyes fading like a mist lifting with the wind.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Freya's body was completely freed from the malicious Mu Ning, and her expression returned to normal.</p>

  <p>"Z-Luo Luo Zheng..." Freya called.</p>

  <p>Just now, she had fallen into a frenzy. Her mind had been dominated by the malicious Mu Ning, so she didn't know what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Leave the Endless Abyss," Luo Luo Zheng said simply, not elaborating further.</p>

  <p>At this, Freya's expression instantly froze. Luo Luo Zheng had spoken seriously instead of the cordial way he usually addressed her. She lowered her eyes as she bit her lip and uttered, "Hmm." She knew that she was nothing but deadweight. Her following Luo Luo Zheng was holding him back. It made perfect sense that he would want her to leave the underground palace as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched shadows cross over her features. The tremble in her lips betrayed her emotions even as she answered him in a levelled voice. Luo Luo Zheng gave her a reassuring smile and said, "It's not what you think. I have other things to take care of."</p>

  <p>"Other things?" Freya asked in a concerned voice.</p>

  <p>"You'll find out soon enough." Luo Luo Zheng turned back to approach the wall, and with a stomp, sped up his sprint, leaving Freya to stare after his receding figure.</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, she activated the divine texture.</p>
