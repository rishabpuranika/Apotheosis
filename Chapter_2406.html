  <p>Andreas didn't understand what Joy was saying at all.</p>

  <p>When he felt a gush of wind on his face, he sensed that something was wrong, but he couldn't figure out what it was. After all, the wind howled all the time in this ice and snow.</p>

  <p>But when he saw Luo Zheng again, he realized that the distance between him and Luo Zheng had reduced to less than a foot.</p>

  <p>Feeling Luo Zheng's strong and dangerous presence at such a close distance overwhelmed Andreas. Instead of counterattacking, he chose to shoot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>At any time, life came above everything. This was what most of the True Gods who roamed the divine land would have chosen to do if they had been in such a situation.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had come too close to Andreas to let him escape so easily.</p>

  <p>In a split second, Luo Zheng's hand reached out as fast as lightning and grabbed one of Andreas's legs before he could completely rise into the sky.</p>

  <p>A gut-wrenching pain shot up Andreas' leg, making him feel so dizzy that he lost his balance.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Even though he'd been about to fall anyway, he was suddenly smashed down by a strong force. The thick snow cushioned his fall but the strong impact nevertheless made his blood surge.</p>

  <p>"This guy... Is he really just a low-rank True God?"</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, Andreas gulped. Fear was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Not far away, the trembling True Gods all turned their heads when they heard the sound. When they saw the low-rank True God smashing Andreas to the ground, they all widened their eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>Darrel and the others had thought that the two low-rank True Gods would be no match for the two top-rank True Gods, just like themselves.</p>

  <p>However, not only had that young man fought back, he had also knocked down a top-rank True God in just one move, leaving him no strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Damn it..."</p>

  <p>Looking at his fellow apprentice, who had been pathetically knocked down, Jordi's expression changed again.</p>

  <p>He didn't know where the young man had come from, so he looked at Joy insidiously. Having made up his mind, he left the group of True Gods behind and suddenly turned into a light, rushing toward Joy.</p>

  <p>As he shot toward her, a steel claw appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>He believed that the safest approach was to subdue the woman first.</p>

  <p>With his fast speed, it only took him a blink of an eye to cross such a short distance.</p>

  <p>But the moment he left the group of True Gods behind, Joy frowned slightly under her cloak, watching him.</p>

  <p>Except for Nicholas, nobody else had fought with her for many years. In fact, she hadn't fought with anyone in this divine era.</p>

  <p>She raised her hand slightly under the cloak and pointed at the man in white.</p>

  <p>An invisible force quietly began to condense... Before Jordi could reach her, the force condensed into a sword inside his body.</p>

  <p>Just like Andreas, Jordi, who had charged ferociously at Joy, didn't realize how his opponent had attacked. He only felt a sharp pain shooting up his body.</p>

  <p>His internal organs and his inner world, which had reached the peak level, were completely destroyed by Joy's invisible sword.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>As Jordi fell to the ground, he spat out a mouthful of blood. His eyes were wide open in horror.</p>

  <p>The seemingly charming beauty in front of him had turned out to be a ferocious monster.</p>

  <p>In a panic, he even crawled away on his hands and knees.</p>

  <p>Joy looked at the scene with utter indifference.</p>

  <p>Killing a top-rank True God who was not from a rich and powerful clan above the Time Sea was as easy as killing an ant to her; it was simple but meaningless. If the idiot hadn't charged at her, she wouldn't even have bothered to make a move.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, she would have preferred to see how Luo Zheng dealt with the two top-rank True Gods. Unfortunately, she would now only be able to watch him deal with one of them.</p>

  <p>With a flick of her slender finger, the sword that had stirred in Jordi's body shot out and stabbed into his mind along his neck. It crushed his soul completely and, at the same time, lifted his skull.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Fresh blood gushed out and spread all over the snow. The scene was appalling.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Joy withdrew her lily-white hand back into her cloak as if she was feeling cold.</p>

  <p>Watching this, Andreas was flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had seen Jordi make a move, he had known what was on Jordi's mind. Since the man was difficult to deal with, Jordi had wanted to start with the woman.</p>

  <p>But now, after the unfathomable way in which she had killed Jordi, it seemed that this beautiful lady was countless times more terrible than this young man!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Andreas, whose face was deathly pale, and shook his head slightly. "Why couldn't you have just taken the divine might coins so that everyone could be happy?"</p>

  <p>Andreas was also regretful, but at this time, his only thought was to escape.</p>

  <p>He suddenly turned over and leaped into the air, shooting off in one direction.</p>

  <p>However, after flying for four or five thousand feet, he realized that something was wrong. He was suddenly feeling weak and dizzy...</p>

  <p>When he turned his head to take a look, fear gripped him.</p>

  <p>A long trail of blood splattered behind him, and blood continued to gush out of his leg.</p>

  <p>As a top-rank True God coming from the grassroots level, although his cultivation and strength were pretty good, there was a huge gap between his knowledge and the knowledge of the disciples from large clans on the Floating Islands. He hadn't had the chance to cultivate a token beyond way, so he didn't realize that he had been hit by Luo Zheng's Blood Breaking Bite.</p>

  <p>The more he moved, the more blood he would lose.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't dare to stay in the vicinity after seeing Joy's ruthless way of killing. He continued to shoot away at a high speed while trying to stop the bleeding.</p>

  <p>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't heal the little wound on his leg at all. It was as if there was a fiend that was constantly sucking the blood out of his body and spitting it out!</p>

  <p>Only then did he understand what this wound meant.</p>

  <p>As more and more blood gushed out of his body, he made up his mind and slashed with his sword.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>He had cut off his wounded left leg.</p>

  <p>After observing his body for a few seconds, he realized with a sigh of relief that this method had worked. It was fortunate for him that Luo Zheng had used the Blood Breaking Bite on his leg. If Luo Zheng had used it on his head, he couldn't have solved the problem by chopping his head off.</p>

  <p>Dragging his severed leg along with him, Andreas continued speeding into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Should I go after him?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste any more time," Joy said while shaking her head. As she narrowed her eyes, wisps of purple light condensed into a monster covered with spikes.</p>

  <p>After the monster took shape, it waved its sharp front paws, dug in the snow for a while, and quickly dived into it.</p>

  <p>The only indicator that it was traveling was the rapidly moving bulge underneath the blanket of snow. The monster was racing in the direction which Andreas had escaped in.</p>

  <p>"Let's go." After releasing the monster, Joy walked forward, leaving footprints behind in the snow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed her without so much as a glance back.</p>

  <p>Darrel and the other True Gods stood rooted to the spot, stunned by what they had seen.</p>

  <p>Two top-rank True Gods who had won hundreds of battles hadn't been able to fight back at all against these two strangers. What was even more bewildering was that the aura of the monster that the beauty in the cloak had casually created using the Purple Aura Divine Dao was much more terrifying than the aura of any top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>However, that woman was only a low-rank True God herself!</p>

  <p>The scene in front of them was completely beyond their ability to comprehend.</p>

  <p>Although they were in a daze, when Luo Zheng and Joy walked past them, the group of True Gods, led by Darrel, bowed to them and watched them leave while holding their breaths.</p>
