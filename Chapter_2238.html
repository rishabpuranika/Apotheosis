  <p>By now, Luo Luo Zheng realized that his involvement with these men would be a never-ending battle.</p>

  <p>Even if he defeated Sheridan, someone else would inevitably take his place to continue harassing him.</p>

  <p>Harder still, it was verging on impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to fight against a True God, even if it was a low-rank one. At his current level, he would definitely lose if he fought with a mid-rank one.</p>

  <p>His only chance was to hold Sheridan hostage. That was the most realistic strategy he could adopt.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples of the wealthy clans were cruel, they cherished their lives above all else. In their eyes, everyone outside the Floating Islands was worthless. They would never sacrifice themselves for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And he was right.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the fierce expression on Luo Zheng's face, silence fell upon the crowd like a giant blanket.</p>

  <p>Out of the almost oppressive silence, a purple-haired young man near Luo Luo Zheng at the edge of the crowd narrowed his eyes and said in a harsh voice,</p>

  <p>"Do you have any idea who you're going up against?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Luo Luo Zheng answered, a smirk curling the edge of his lips. "He is from the Xie Clan. That is all the information I need."</p>

  <p>"You are naive. His surname is unimportant. What you don't know is that his grandfather is a Holy Being," replied the purple-haired man, visibly frustrated at Luo Zheng's complacence. "You know the consequences of killing him, don't you?" he said, louder this time. Luo Luo Zheng didn't have to say anything. The purple-haired young man sneered victoriously. He knew Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't dare to do anything to harm Sheridan.</p>

  <p>After this exchange, the tense atmosphere relaxed slightly. It was like a bomb had been disarmed. The crowd knew that Luo Zheng's intentions were nonviolent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked, his expression wide-eyed and somewhat disturbed. "If I don't kill him today, will you let me go? Sheridan has been trying to kill me time and time again, and every time he has acted without mercy.</p>

  <p>Why can't I have the chance to kill him since he already wants to kill me? It's just a matter of survival. Of self-defense. Anyone can relate to that! Is his life so precious that it is worth exchanging mine for?"</p>

  <p>Having said his piece, Luo Luo Zheng stomped on Sheridan, whose chest caved in because of the impact. Sheridan spluttered and groaned, gasping for breath as Luo Zheng's boot pressed into his chest. It sounded as though Sheridan was barely clinging onto life.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods in the divine land had existed for countless years. It was not in their nature and practice to show emotions. Emotions were always seen as a sign of weakness, even if it was compassion or pity towards someone who was dying in front of them. For instance, when Master Evil, whose remnant soul was in Luo Zheng's mind currently, saw this scene, he wouldn't even blink his eyes. He had been so used to such kind of situations.</p>

  <p>However, these disciples of wealthy clans were quite young.</p>

  <p>Experienced as they were in the countless battles in the Arena of Legends, those battles were simulated and were certainly not fights to the death. The disputes among these disciples from the big clans on the Floating Islands often left room for negotiations. Being skilled and all having a high status, they just felt it was more practical that way. And if they really killed each other, the result wouldn't be favorable.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that the disciples had greatly underestimated Luo Zheng's abilities as well as cruelty.</p>

  <p>The disciples exchanged confused and scared glances, not knowing how to answer Luo Zheng's question. The purple-haired young man who had spoken before also fell into silence. The illusion of nonviolence was shattered, and tension charged the atmosphere once again. It was obvious that Luo Luo Zheng would absolutely kill Sheridan at the slightest hint that fighting would begin.</p>

  <p>However, by killing Sheridan, Luo Luo Zheng would inadvertently sign his own death sentence too. And this group of disciples would also get into trouble. They might be not severely punished, but they would be admonished and grounded by their respective clans. After all, they weren't free to do what they wanted: each clan had their own set of rules and restrictions for such situations.</p>

  <p>Two of the three girls, Kelsey and Aleyna, were overjoyed, in stark contrast to the scared and confused crowd. They wore proud smiles on their faces. This young proving godly warrior named Tianxing alone was enough to hold these disciples in awe. If the news got out, the Han Clan would gain widespread respect. After all, he came from the Floating Island of the Han Clan and was now protecting the princesses of this clan.</p>

  <p>However, Liusu's eyes were as clear and deep as a still mountain pond on a clear and crisp winter day. Those eyes were fixed on Luo Luo Zheng. She sighed deeply, and felt her heart flutter with admiration. This man was so strong. He was never scared of anything, not even his own death. And he had always triumphed over everyone in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, using only his own strength. Now that he was on the Floating Island, where the Han Clan lived, he was showing strength of character despite being faced with a situation so terrifying most would flee.</p>

  <p>Beside Han Liusu stood Langston, her fiance. Noticing her expression, he could not help but feel helplessly jealous seeing her eyes fill with admiration for another man.</p>

  <p>It was an arranged engagement, and they only met twice. Needless to say they did not know each other very well. However, Langston could not contain his jealousy as, distant as she was, she had nevertheless been promised to him.</p>

  <p>Langston came to visit Han Liusu often, but she had refused to see him every time. Her rejection made him rather angry, and now his anger was compounded by his jealousy.</p>

  <p>What kind of person was Langston?</p>

  <p>His status, cultivation level and talent were on par with Liusu's. He could find a partner of her level easily. It was not as if he didn't have other options. Countless girls with the same breeding wanted to marry him.</p>

  <p>However, as a male member of the Leng Clan, Langston had factors other than breeding and talent to consider when choosing a future wife.</p>

  <p>He knew why his father wanted him to marry a girl from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>He also knew that a great earthquake was due to hit the Time Sea. After careful evaluation of the overall situation, he was determined to marry Han Liusu. It had not been a difficult decision to make, however, as he happened to like her. After all, she was beautiful and elegant.</p>
