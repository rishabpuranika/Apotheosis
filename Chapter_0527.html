<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 527 Powerful Internal Elixir Realm Warriors (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stamped her foot in nervous anger. Just when she would have acted rashly, she felt Luo Zheng's arm seize hers. She looked over and saw Luo Luo Zheng shaking his head, before giving her a calming tranquil glance, even though the pressure pushing in on him was so intense that he couldn't make a sound.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning saw the look in his eyes, she was dumbfounded. She knew that he was silently telling her he would endure and not to worry.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul was firmer and stronger than most fighters. All this time, Luo Luo Zheng had defeated many fighters, not only warriors that were the same rank as him, but the ones who were above him, at the preliminary stages of Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>But strong as his soul was, it wasn't stronger than that of an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. When a fighter entered the Internal Elixir Realm, he was addressed as an expert and treated respectfully throughout the Eastern Region. The Internal Elixir Realm warriors were representative of the elite martial art warriors that the Eastern Region offered. And when they used their might against Luo Luo Zheng, it was a stiff trial.</p>

  <p>"Cra-aa-ck!"</p>

  <p>Under the immense pressure, Luo Zheng's soul began to shudder.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously, his voice vibrated in his throat. Still, he gazed at Mu Ning with comforting warmth.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning could sense the agony he felt though, and looking in his eyes, she saw his pain deep in there. She knew Luo Luo Zheng was close to the brink of destruction and failure. Luo Luo Zheng was indeed the genius who took first place in the All Peaks Competition, and he did it even though he was at the nature level. Still, there were warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm and also the Internal Elixir Realm above the nature creatures.</p>

  <p>Next to them, Luo Luo Zheng might as well have been an ant. He'd been proud of the intensity of his soul, but, it was no longer an advantage. It was just a matter of time before he was beaten, and crushed until only ashes remained.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning took Luo Zheng's hand in silence and squeezed it so tightly that her knuckles began to turn white from the force.</p>

  <p>She had the urge to kneel before her half-brothers and beg them to let Luo Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>Experience had taught her that no amount of pleading with them would work though. There wasn't much family affection in the royal family, and they'd endangered themselves before struggling with each other. The only way that her brothers would listen was if Mu Ning offered something that they were interested in having.</p>

  <p>What should she do though? How could she possibly help? Desperately racking her brain for an idea, Mu Ning began to feel overwhelmed, and couldn't recall ever feeling so vulnerable and fragile. Her eyes welled up with tears.</p>

  <p>Alongside Mu Ning, Luo Zheng's soul shook more violently and was on the verge of giving way. If his soul disintegrated, he would never recover his sanity, and he'd be an idiot forever.</p>

  <p>The chief eunuch and Hendy reined in their assault when they saw how close Luo Luo Zheng was to the edge, allowing him a small respite. Since they were aware if Luo Luo Zheng suffered irreversible damage, it would aggravate Kenneth and bring trouble to the two princes, they didn't want that to happen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a thunderous laugh was heard in the sky above them.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha! Bullying my disciple, what powerful Internal Elixir Realm warriors you two must be! Shame on you!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the newcomer finished speaking, an invisible force spread and enveloped Luo Luo Zheng. The barrier of protection stopped the storm of pressure from falling on him, ricocheting it back at Hendy and the chief eunuch.</p>

  <p>Hurt by the injuries the two got from the rebounding, they groaned and turned pale. The eunuch suffering more retreated a few paces. The two of them stared at the newcomer with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As the colossal figure, he slammed into the ground from the air, and his feet crushed the stone tiling.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of them was an unshakable mountain of a man!</p>

  <p>"Master Shi!" Aura's eyes glistened as she shouted joyfully.</p>

  <p>Kenneth nodded in acknowledgement before he gave Luo Luo Zheng a glance and asked, "You still alive over there?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng bobbed his head and took a deep breath. The color returned to his face quickly and he was able to think straight. Only moments ago, he'd been at a critical juncture and thought his soul would give out.</p>

  <p>In his mind, the cyan dragon gave his head a slight disapproving shake and said to himself, 'His soul is always absolutely safe with me here.'</p>

  <p>The dragon was still too weak to remain awake for long since the Killing Sword Mountain, and had been sleeping soundly earlier. When Luo Luo Zheng was attacked, and the pressure became unbearable, the cyan dragon woke up, and, even though he remained silent, he watched Luo Luo Zheng and his two opponents. But, the cyan dragon was only there to observe and didn't intend to rush to his aid because Luo Luo Zheng needed to overcome every obstacle on his own.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might be gifted, intelligent, and blessed, but for him to be truly strong, he needed to be able to manage alone. Outside forces, after all, would be another's power, and Luo Luo Zheng couldn't rely on others all the time.</p>

  <p>Since there was a light-ray within the furnace that was capable of repairing any soul damage, instantly, the cyan dragon planned on waiting until Luo Zheng's soul had been disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Kenneth interrupted his plans when he suddenly appeared, saved Luo Luo Zheng, and prevented Luo Zheng's soul from disintegrating.</p>

  <p>Actually, Kenneth had been there, watching for some time too. He hadn't showed himself until a critical point came and Luo Luo Zheng was about to fail.</p>

  <p>Of course, Kenneth didn't know that the cyan dragon was in Luo Luo Zheng and could have saved him at the last minute. So, to ensure that Luo Luo Zheng didn't end up mindless, he needed to step in and help. After all, Luo Luo Zheng was the most significant disciple participating in the Cloud Road Test. Therefore, Kenneth needed to prevent any accidents from befalling him, especially any that would damage his soul and leave him an idiot forever.</p>

  <p>This was why he had shown up, and forced the two attackers to retreat.</p>
