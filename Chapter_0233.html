<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Let's see what that boy will do!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he'll get eaten by the Koi."</p>

  <p>Once again, the noble people talked haughtily among themselves and relished in telling each other about what miseries Luo Zheng would end up in.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng still noticed the obstacles and hazards around him with his strong soul, even when he ran quite fast.</p>

  <p>As he neared the fish that waited for him along the way, Luo Zheng jumped up at a high altitude.</p>

  <p>The Koi also jumped up from the jade path with a flick of their tails, and opened their mouths to bite Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Phoenix Crystal!" Luo Zheng chanted.</p>

  <p>He had emitted energy from the Phoenix Crystal embedded in his right arm just in time for this critical moment. When he released the energy, he felt his body become lighter and his speed increased several more times.</p>

  <p>Now, the fishes out of the water were less agile and powerful, and thus Luo Zheng had successfully escaped.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng hopped among the remaining Koi carps in the last parts of the jade path. He finally got to the pavilion after a lot of threats, but he got out unscathed.</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm masters who had previously flown to the pavilion were shocked to see Luo Zheng when he rushed down the jade path.</p>

  <p>Old Wilson's hate-filled eyes looked repulsively at his approaching figure.</p>

  <p>'The boy sticks to us like an annoying dog, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Old Wilson's murderous glare did not escape Zheng's eyes, but he simply shrugged his shoulders and said, "You know that my black wolf incarnated from life vitality is still fighting with the two giant puppets outside now. It's easy for me to bring them in."</p>

  <p>When she heard Zheng's words, the long-haired woman yelled to Wilson,</p>

  <p>"Wilson, not now. We have more important things to do. Don't rock the boat. He's already here anyway."</p>

  <p>Old Wilson didn't say anything more.</p>

  <p>After he composed himself, Luo Zheng circled the huge pavilion then realized why everyone stopped advancing at this place.</p>

  <p>It turned out that it was a special pavilion that only allowed anyone to enter, but not to leave.</p>

  <p>From the outside, the pavilion was huge, measuring at least tens of thousands of feet high. Except for its large size, its shape and form did not differ from those of an ordinary pavilion.</p>

  <p>Inside it however, was a completely different scene.</p>

  <p>Only if one walked in would they find a pink colored enchanted barrier which blocked the eight exits of the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some people had thought that as long as they entered the pavilion, they would be able to access their favorite treasure house.</p>

  <p>However, the pavilion was unexpectedly a cage that locked in everyone that would enter.</p>

  <p>In the center of the pavilion, there were huge Eight Diagrams, around which eight Chinese characters were written respectively. The eight words in proper order were "Heaven," "Earth," "Thunder," "Wind,"</p>

  <p>"Water," "Fire," "Mountain," and "Valley."</p>

  <p>At a glimpse of those eight words, Luo Zheng suddenly remembered the information recorded on the inner page of the Weapon Refining Principle written by the master weapon refiner, Chase.</p>

  <p>'Since the Dragon Valley was also recorded in that book, the information of the Eight Diagrams in the book should be related to this huge Eight Diagrams in front of me, ' Luo Zheng speculated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed there were stone sculptures scattered around in the pavilion.</p>

  <p>They were supposedly assigned to the positions of the eight Chinese characters in the Eight Diagrams. The goal was obvious: to get out of this pavilion, one had to use the sculptures to solve the diagrams first.</p>

  <p>However, it was very difficult to figure out how to place the sculptures to each character of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>It needed to be calculated accurately, and in precise numbers. There was absolutely no room for errors in the whole process.</p>

  <p>In the case of a wrong placement, a fatal threat might befall on them.</p>

  <p>Even though they were in plenty of potential peril, they had no better way. They were currently intercepted in the pink enchantment area. If they couldn't break through the pavilion, they would all die in the end.</p>

  <p>Silence enveloped the pavilion as they tried to think of what to do.</p>

  <p>"What do we do? Who can decode the Eight Diagrams?" a female voice asked. It was the long haired woman, who waited for an answer with anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>"I can't. I don't know anything about the Eight Diagrams," said Wilson, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Others shook their heads too. There were some masters skilled at the Eight Diagrams among the seven noble clans, but they weren't with them now.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Luo Zheng asked, "How about let me try?"</p>

  <p>"You?" screamed Wilson as he viciously glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You had better worry about your own life," he sneered.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had expected that they would refuse his offer. Of course, it was impossible for them to hand over their fate to an unknown person in a mask.</p>

  <p>At this point, everyone's mood had turned quite sour. This choice between life and death was a really hard test.</p>

  <p>After a long while, someone spoke again. "Well, I'll do it," the long haired woman said and broke the silence. "I used to learn the Eight Diagrams. So I know a little bit, though I am not skilled," she added.</p>

  <p>Nobody answered back. Even though they weren't confident enough with the long haired woman's ability, they had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Everyone had acquiesced to remain silent, then the long-haired woman began the work of calculation and prediction. After a while, she suddenly looked up and emitted life vitality from her hands. Her life vitality covered the head of one sculpture like a cap, then slowly raised it up in the air.</p>
