<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others were on the platform, casually chatting about the knowledge of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. And at the same time, they were refining the Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>After Lucille and the others were teleported to this land, things were not easy for them. And they would go all out for a purple trial tally. Lone, on the other hand, nearly died in the whole process.</p>

  <p>When the surrounding warriors on the platforms observed their crystals of Pristine Life Vitality quickly piled up like a small mountain, their faces were full of envy. But, they could only go as far as envy Zheng's godlike strength. Who would dare to provoke him?</p>

  <p>Moreover, from the attitude of the Skyland race, this fellow seemed to be respected even by Kaydan. Everyone couldn't guess the reason, but that wasn't important. What mattered most was that no one dared to fight with him.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng prepared to leave and did not stay there for long.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also keenly observed the crystals of Pristine Life Vitality. They seemed to be relatively special but quite similar to the life vitality crystals. But, the structure was completely different.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, after Luo Zheng absorbed these black crystals into his body, they simply could not fuse with the chaotic energy and were quickly devoured by the chaos. With this, there was no need for him to stay here for a long time.</p>

  <p>So when Luo Zheng left the Tidal Surge, he went to see Kaydan. He told him to keep the platform for his friends.</p>

  <p>Since this was a simple request for Kaydan, he eagerly agreed.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors from the divine land created a dramatic scene as soon as Luo Zheng had left. They deemed themselves as powerhouses and were ready to take over the central platform again.</p>

  <p>But a group of people from the Skyland race soon arrived, announcing that the central platform was reserved for Luo Zheng. The central platform was at Lucille and the other two's disposal.</p>

  <p>This was a request personally made by Luo Zheng in consideration of the ten people from the universe who came to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Skyland race was the most important sacred place for cultivation. And the others would fight to enter this place as well, so they would be able to share it with the three of them.</p>

  <p>And that kind of request was very predictable.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Karl and Xenia entered the Skyland race exactly when Luo Zheng was still cultivating on top of a pagoda.</p>

  <p>As secondary creatures, they successfully entered the Tidal Surge after they had paid the trial tally. However, they did not encounter Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Compared to the others, their luck was a little lacking. It had taken them a lot of time to obtain the purple trial tally.</p>

  <p>In fact, it wasn't easy to obtain a purple trial tally in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Some warriors could spend several years, or even several decades, and this only proved that these ten people were top ten warriors in the entire universe, the cream of the crop!</p>

  <p>The two of them gained entry at the Tidal Surge, and just like Luo Zheng, they had no idea how to cultivate in this place.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the platform also ignored them as they wanted to inquire about the situation.</p>

  <p>When they wanted to climb onto a platform, they would be chased away by the warriors on the platform. The place was packed with people who had already entered the platform and were resisting the newcomers.</p>

  <p>Karl was so calm about the entire situation, while Xenia had nearly fought with someone. But she was still stopped by Karl knowing they had just arrived here. Before they managed to understand the rules, it was indeed unsuitable for them to have a dispute with someone.</p>

  <p>With traces of hostility showing on their faces, the warriors standing on the other platforms watched them closely. They even sneered at the two of them for being ignorant.</p>

  <p>At any rate, any warrior who had newly entered the Tidal Surge would have to take this initial step. However, at the time Luo Zheng entered this place, Han Liusu led him directly to the central platform, creating a ruckus.</p>

  <p>Just as the two of them were hesitating, they suddenly heard someone shout, "Xenia!"</p>

  <p>They quickly turned their heads, scanning the platform not far away, only to see three people standing on it. It was Lucille, Kurt and Lone.</p>

  <p>What struck them was that only three of them were on the platform.</p>

  <p>Comparing the other platforms with fully packed people against the empty platform, Karl and Xenia suddenly felt very strange.</p>

  <p>However, they were overjoyed to be able to encounter such old friends here. Thus, the two of them flew toward the platform without qualms!</p>

  <p>"Lucille, why is such a big platform monopolized by you?" Xenia asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she still hadn't figured out the rules of this place, but with Xenia's keen senses, she knew that there were some extraordinary resources on these platforms. Therefore, those warriors from other races weren't willing to share them with her.</p>

  <p>However, there were only three people on this vast platform. That alone was odd and at the same time, extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Lucille clearly understood why Xenia was acting so strange. She merely gave a faint smile and said, "It is all thanks to Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?" Xenia's eyes widened in surprise. She immediately scanned the area before she asked, "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Lone shook his head as he recounted the entire process of how the three of them obtained the platform. Finally, he said, "I'm afraid that fellow has no interest in the Pristine Life Vitality here. I wonder if he has left the Skyland race yet..."</p>

  <p>Xenia was astonished to hear this. A lot of talents filled this cultivation sacred place. There were not only geniuses from the universes gathered here, but there were even some who came from the divine land. Yet, that fellow was still able to stand out amongst them and obtain such benefits for them. Luo Zheng paved the road for them.</p>

  <p>After the tide surged, Xenia and Karl now finally and truly understood what it meant to have obtained such a big platform.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, did not leave the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>For the past few days, he stayed within the Skyland race, patiently waiting for the arrival of the Harmony race.</p>

  <p>During his idle time, Luo Zheng continued to keenly observe the inner world.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the nine stars looked incredibly dim after Luo Zheng drew their power from them.</p>

  <p>The strength source could not be overdrawn indefinitely. For ordinary body refiners, after they opened up the Nine Divine Stars and used up all of the power, they would still need a long time to nurture and sustain nine stars to their peak state. And most often than not, it might take a few months to achieve their peak state.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after they cultivated to the extreme, body refiners would have a huge weakness— their combat power could not be sustained.</p>

  <p>Because no one could directly convert life vitality into pure strength.</p>

  <p>Chaotic energy was like a cure-all since the chaos was the root of everything, as everything was derived from it. The nine stars actually hung above the chaotic sea, but were nourished by the said chaotic energy. Through these nine stars, the recovery speed of the power was something that other warriors, and even the Holy Being, were beyond compare. The Holy Being constructed the universe, but the universe did not contain chaotic energy. Hence, the Holy Being would not absorb the chaotic energy, for his use.</p>

  <p>When he had trained the Primal Chaos Technique to this point, Luo Zheng now encountered a serious problem.</p>

  <p>He did not know how to expand his inner world.</p>

  <p>The creatures within the inner world were still rapidly growing. One after another, dynasties passed. Creatures of all kinds and different types of divine weapons were born, and the scene was full of vigor and vitality.</p>

  <p>The size of the chaotic sea was slowly shrinking, but the continent situated in the middle was constantly expanding.</p>

  <p>Seriously, the problem was that the entire chaotic sea did not increase in size! If he wanted to cultivate his life vitality, Luo Zheng could have stayed in the Skyland race to absorb the black crystals, and try to expand his inner world.</p>

  <p>The size of the inner world was also a measure of one's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were unable to expand his inner world even further, then he would lose any means of raising his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was unfortunately unable to find the answer within the Primal Chaos Technique, he had to explore. A path that others had never taken was destined to have too many risks and uncertainties, but it would also yield astonishing harvests and unexpected results.</p>

  <p>In addition to exploring the inner world, Luo Zheng also needed to deal with the two sisters from Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Although this woman had taken advantage of him once, Han Liusu still knew when to advance and when to retreat. However, her little sister was quite different. Her sister was an ignorant little girl who kept pestering him with lots of questions. She even asked Luo Zheng which universe did he come from.</p>

  <p>"I also don't know which universe I come from." Luo Zheng didn't know much about the powers in the divine land, nor was he aware what the universe was named. Perhaps, Tianming and Master Feng knew a bit, and yet they were hiding something from him.</p>

  <p>"Who is the trustee?" Aleyna suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"What is a trustee?" Luo Zheng naturally didn't know what she meant.</p>

  <p>Aleyna showed off arrogantly. "So you don't even know what a trustee is… The universe is indeed a backward place!"</p>

  <p>"Aleyna!" Han Liusu felt her sister's words were a bit rude.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng waved his hand dismissively and said, "It doesn't matter. I wonder if the person you're referring to is the one who controls the heavens."</p>

  <p>At this time, Zheng's interest was piqued. He understood that there was some vital information he needed to grasp himself. The two girls weren't scheming people, so he naturally needed to seize this opportunity to learn a thing or two.</p>

  <p>And because of this probing, Luo Zheng had a new understanding of the entire divine land.</p>
