<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'Yes! Comprehend the Thunder Law and control it!' Zheng thought, his heart skipping a beat.</p>

  <p>One couldn't blame Zheng for not being able to think of this earlier as he had been focusing all his attention on resisting the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>He didn't realize that instead of fighting the Heavenly Tribulation, he could make use of it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure flashed as he suddenly descended, dodging the attack from the two lightning dragons. Both dragons entwined with each other, forming a bigger one again, and charged towards him.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>During this process, thick bolts of lightning struck out in all directions.</p>

  <p>Some of the lightning bolts struck the ground and were quickly absorbed by the earth, while other lightning bolts headed straight for the Soul Sea Realm masters present.</p>

  <p>All of the Soul Sea Realm masters had already activated their life vitality to protect themselves, but the lightning bolts were lashing about like whips, striking their shields of life vitality and causing them to tremble.</p>

  <p>'Thunder Law!'</p>

  <p>Zheng already comprehended the first layer of Thunder Law when he was at the Genuine Dragon World. This was the foundation of his Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's figure rapidly descended, he began to observe the Thunder Law contained within the enormous lightning dragon above him closely.</p>

  <p>The first layer of the Thunder Law was Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The second layer was Purification, and the third was Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>When warriors advanced to the Life and Death Realm, the life and death crisis triggered by them included the third layer of the Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>This was probably the reason that the third layer was called Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>However, the enormous lightning dragon that Zheng was facing right now contained the fourth layer of the Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>He silently gazed at the enormous lightning dragon as his mind spun rapidly. The mysterious Thunder Law hidden within the dazzling lightning bolts was slowly being unveiled to him.</p>

  <p>The more compatible one was with a law, the faster one could comprehend it. After going through the baptism by laws, Zheng could easily understand lower layers of various laws, though higher layers of laws were still a little difficult for him to comprehend.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, understanding the Thunder Law in a short period of time wasn't an easy task. Moreover, the lightning dragon didn't let go of Zheng.</p>

  <p>It charged towards him repeatedly, in an attempt to swallow him.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng did not resist. He was completely absorbed into the world of Thunder Law. The Thunder Law contained within every lightning bolt was like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that swiftly started assembling in his mind. He wanted to control the Thunder Law contained within this lightning dragon completely before his body reached its limit.</p>

  <p>Three seconds...</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds...</p>

  <p>Sixty seconds...</p>

  <p>The lightning corroded Zheng's body continuously. Even his sacred weapon-like body wouldn't be able to withstand these lightning strikes.</p>

  <p>A burning smell emanated from his charred body. It was scorched black by the lightning.</p>

  <p>His body couldn't take it anymore!</p>

  <p>Zheng was pressed for time. The pieces of the Thunder Law, from the first layer to the fourth layer, appeared in his mind continuously, and he had already completed one-third of this jigsaw puzzle in a short period of time. However, his body was unable to withstand any more stress. It was becoming weaker and weaker. If he were to continue standing here and allowing this lightning dragon to strike him again, his body would probably be damaged before he could fully grasp the fourth layer.</p>

  <p>Originally, he had planned to rely solely on his own strength to endure this lightning dragon. But he could no longer do so. It seemed that he had overestimated his body.</p>

  <p>He let out a soft sigh. Suddenly he had an epiphany. He immediately began to transfer the power he had received.</p>

  <p>"Transfer the power!"</p>

  <p>By doing this, Zheng was using the entire world to help him bear the brunt of the lightning strikes.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a ginormous splash within the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>This was followed by a second, a third, a fourth... In this way, countless violent splashes appeared and disappeared without a sound.</p>

  <p>Zheng had transferred the attacks from the lightning dragon aimed at him into the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Thanks to this transfer of power, Zheng finally had enough time to comprehend the fourth layer of Thunder Law that was contained within the lightning dragon.</p>

  <p>'Great! I've already grasped the second and third layers of the Thunder Law.' He stared at the dazzling lightning while absorbing the Thunder Law within frantically. He was sharp as a tack.</p>

  <p>Laws were more difficult to comprehend when they came to the higher layers. It was easier to comprehend the first, second and third layers of the Thunder Law, but after reaching the fourth layer, the level of difficulty had increased.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Feather Holy Sea, a massive amount of seawater continued to churn, and as the waves hit, it finally turned into a monstrous tsunami. The waves were over a thousand feet high, and they advanced fiercely in the direction of the Feather Emperor Island. If this tsunami were to hit the island, it was likely that the entire island would be submerged.</p>

  <p>Obviously the four divine kingdoms did not want this to happen. Three of the Soul Sea Realm masters rushed to deal with the surging tsunami.</p>

  <p>"Set up an enchanted barrier! Block the waves!"</p>

  <p>"No! We can't just block it. If we do so and try to push it back, I'm afraid we'll destroy the cities near the Feather Holy Sea."</p>

  <p>"Then let's eliminate this tsunami!"</p>

  <p>The three powerful warriors launched a joint attack. They set up two enchanted barriers to isolate the tsunami. The tsunami danced manically back and forth between the two enchanted barriers for a long time before finally calming down.</p>

  <p>However, just as they got rid of this tsunami, another one formed not far away. The three Soul Sea Realm masters looked at each other and smiled bitterly. They proceeded to subdue the new tsunami once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not afraid of the current Thunder Tribulation as he could transfer the power he had received. However, he knew it wouldn't be easy to deal with the other waves of the Heavenly Tribulation. The current Thunder Tribulation was just the first wave of attack by the Heavenly Tribulation. So he did not want to use the power transferring skill, which was his trump card, to overcome the Thunder Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning dragon wrapped around Zheng like a hot white chain. Soon so many lightning bolts were covering his body that the crowd could no longer see what was going on. They could only see a blazing white ball of light.</p>

  <p>"This is the power of the fourth layer of Thunder Law. If I was trapped by such a strong power, I wouldn't be able to escape!" War King Wind said shaking his head. "But Tianxing has fought for so long!"</p>

  <p>"The Thunder Tribulation is just the first wave of attack, yet it has lasted for a long time. It seems like there is no easy way to defeat it. I wonder how he is going to escape," Turner said with a frown. Even though Zheng was able to transfer the power of the lightning into the Feather Holy Sea, the lightning dragon's might did not weaken. How would Zheng get out of the trouble?</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters sighed when they saw this scene. They understood that they probably wouldn't be able to withstand such a terrifying Heavenly Tribulation even with their strength of the Soul Sea Realm. 'Tianxing is indeed a freak! He has attracted such an intense counterattack from the heavens, ' they thought.</p>

  <p>He was someone who had angered even the heavens in the end!</p>

  <p>Everyone was pessimistic about Zheng's fate.</p>

  <p>However, after five minutes, everyone suddenly realized that something was not right. The lightning dragon's body was slowly shrinking.</p>

  <p>"Is the Thunder Tribulation finally coming to an end? But how can it decline so fast?"</p>

  <p>"The downfall of the lightning dragon has just begun. I wonder what happened!"</p>

  <p>"It's really strange. It seems like something has sucked the lightning away!"</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were also at a loss. They stared in bewilderment at the scene playing out before them. At this moment, Fiona pursed her lips and a trace of anticipation appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had exceeded her expectations time and time again. Although she was worried, she still had full of confidence in him and was certain that this time, too, Zheng would be able to do the same.</p>

  <p>The lightning dragon was shrinking rapidly. It decreased from the size of a mountain range to the size of a small mountain in mere seconds. It continued shrinking until it completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he was still standing on the ground. His entire body was charred black, but his pupils were shining brightly. A faint flash of lightning could be seen inside his eyes.</p>
