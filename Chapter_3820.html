  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fox girl stood at the upper right corner of the No-break Maze, sneering at the scramble taking place below.</p>

  <p>There were many rooms of hexagram arrays at the end of the maze; those unwilling to surrender would most likely attempt to escape into these rooms. She had expected them to follow this course of action.</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously think resuming your original form will help you fight me?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, none who came before you got away from me. Do you think you'll manage it?</p>

  <p>Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Her laughter was as crisp and sweet as wind chimes stirred by a gentle breeze, but it was lined with menace which shook all the Other Shore creatures to their bones and made them shiver when they heard it.</p>

  <p>She then slowly turned away from the upper right corner.</p>

  <p>"She's coming down!"</p>

  <p>"Does she plan to enter the hexagram arrays?"</p>

  <p>"She's not going to let the Evil Orochis attack instead? She's going to fight on her own?"</p>

  <p>Everyone trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>They might have returned to their original forms, but they were still not confident they could contend with the Evil Orochis.</p>

  <p>If she drove the giant serpents right into the rooms, they'd all be destroyed with ease. Even if they possessed some truly special skills, dealing with the Evil Orochis would still prove mightily difficult.</p>

  <p>But it seemed the fox intended to go in alone.</p>

  <p>She stopped in the center where the passages intersected. Luo Zheng, Egan, Kirk and some other Other Shore creatures were in the room of hexagon array on the left, while Walden and another group were in the room on the right.</p>

  <p>A short while later, she had made her choice and walked towards the room on the right.</p>

  <p>When the creatures, including Walden, saw her coming, their eyes widened and their hearts began beating vigorously.</p>

  <p>They had no way to effectively deal with the Evil Orochis but they believed they might stand a chance against the fox alone.</p>

  <p>They had appeared to be stuck in a dead end but it now seemed a favorable opportunity that they would all seize desperately.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, spread out!"</p>

  <p>"She controls the Evil Orochis, so if we capture her, the snakes will be forced to retreat..."</p>

  <p>"Don't hold anything back. Do whatever is necessary using whatever you have!"</p>

  <p>They had all been cowering in the corner of the room, but now, in the face of battle, they summoned all the courage in their hearts and stood in a semicircle, surrounding the door. They gathered all the strength they had in their bodies.</p>

  <p>The fox stepped into the room and onto the hexagram array, revealing her true form.</p>

  <p>She looked like a little girl of thirteen or fourteen years old with two fluffy ears on her head, her body emitting a faint halo. She was as flawless as white jade, her light purple hair covering most of her baby fat face.</p>

  <p>"This form is truly disgusting..." the fox remarked at her own body.</p>

  <p>As a beast in the scroll painting, she believed her painting form to be at a higher level and that this one contained too many details and was low-grade.</p>

  <p>"Let's get her!"</p>

  <p>Walden bellowed his war cry the second she turned into her normal form.</p>

  <p>He shifted his body slightly and a purple jade token appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>He pinched the token and crushed it to powder.</p>

  <p>As it shattered, a purple shadow burst forth, releasing a vast aura as it did.</p>

  <p>The aura was confined to the room and the intense pressure it gave off forced everyone to take a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Only the fox girl seemed unfazed and stood motionlessly.</p>

  <p>"It's the Blessing Myriad Token! It seems to be of a high grade!"</p>

  <p>"The Violet Cloud race is so generous that they have allowed this man to take this token!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>A flame of hope ignited in the Other Shore creatures' hearts when they saw the purple shadow.</p>

  <p>The Blessing Myriad Token came from Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>There was a mountain known as the Blessing Mountain where there were life forms of pure energy. These life forms were similar to pure energy entities, gentle in nature and numerous in number.</p>

  <p>Once they perished, they would fuse into a kind of purple jade found in the mountain and stay there.</p>

  <p>The more lives fused into a piece of jade, the higher grade it would be.</p>

  <p>Divided according to their colors, there were a total of six grades of the Blessing Myriad Token. The sixth grade was the highest and was considered a lethal weapon in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>This Blessing Myriad Token was a personal token of Walden's grandfather, who had kept it for many years but never used it. His grandfather had given it to him for protection before he entered Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to Walden that he might use it in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Now that the fox girl had given them a shot at survival, he cared about little else. His life was obviously more important than the precious token.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The fox girl's head was shrouded in the purple shadow containing pure energy. She gingerly raised her hand, her two light pink nails intertwined and flicked gently.</p>

  <p>She seemed to have triggered something that spread from her fingertips.</p>

  <p>The wildly surging purple shadow was suppressed in an instant and it shrank and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Walden was in a daze when his chest was suddenly hit by a heavy hammer that sent him into the wall with a thud.</p>

  <p>He leaned against the wall, his muscles, bones and blood imploding. His entire body was almost completely crushed. His soul hadn't been seriously injured but he only had a single breath left.</p>

  <p>"They don't like eating dead things," the fox girl said, looking at his body, disappointed.</p>

  <p>She stretched her pink finger slowly and removed Walden from the wall, dragged him to the hexagram array and threw him from the room.</p>

  <p>The instant he was thrown, his body split into pieces. The broken pieces turned into pictures and scattered on the white scroll in a gruesome scene.</p>

  <p>The Iron Dogs in the upper right corner caught the smell of blood, crawled along the passage and began devouring Walden's broken body.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures still in the room trembled violently. They couldn't help but be overtaken by the fear of being fed to the Iron Dogs.</p>

  <p>"What a strange and horrible skill!"</p>

  <p>"We're going to die anyway, let's at least go down fighting!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>They mustered the courage that remained in them and charged forward together.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's face remained unchanged. She tapped her fingers lightly and her pink nails flicked out once more.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Waves of immense power pummeled into their chests. None of the Other Shore creatures, no matter their sizes, had any power capable of counterattacking. They were already on their last gasp when their bodies hit the wall.</p>

  <p>With another flick of her finger, they too turned into pictures and like Walden, were thrown into the passage to feed the dogs.</p>

  <p>After disposing of the last of them, she slowly turned towards the room across the corridor.</p>

  <p>It was time to clear the left room.</p>
