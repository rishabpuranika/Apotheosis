<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 670 Any Other Volunteers (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The levels of cultivation had significant differences in terms of power and strength. The cultivators at the pinnacle of the Illuminating Soul Realm were far more powerful and stronger than the third grade of the same Realm.</p>

  <p>Hence, the practitioners who had reached the pinnacle of the Illuminating Soul Realm had rushed to Zheng in high confidence.</p>

  <p>Since they had already reached such a cultivation level, they thought that catching a third-grade practitioner like Zheng would be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>It was an easy way to make contributions, hence, everyone rushed to catch Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Fred faced Bevis of the Mysterious Luna Hall, others took it as an opportunity to chase down and attack Zheng simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Among those who were attacking Zheng, Mason was swiftest and most vicious. He didn't care whether Zheng would be injured or broken. If he could still breath and talk, that would be fine. He vowed to catch and take Zheng back no matter what it could cost him.</p>

  <p>Mason took the initiative and started the attack. As the others saw this, they could do nothing but feel bad for Zheng. They knew that once Mason put his heart into something, he would surely do anything to get it done.</p>

  <p>And now that he was determined to catch Zheng, the latter could only wish to see another day. If Zheng got hit by Mason's attack, he could lose his legs and might not be able to walk again…</p>

  <p>However, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could realize what was happening, Zheng had already hit Mason with one blow. The blow was so powerful that Mason flew out.</p>

  <p>He hit on several houses and knocked them down before finally hitting the ground. He was badly injured that even if his wounds healed, it might take half a year to completely recover.</p>

  <p>And with the time he needed to fully recover, he might miss his chance to participate in the upcoming Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>Mason was considered one of the best practitioners who had reached the pinnacle of Illuminating Soul Realm. Although Fred and some other practitioners were better than Mason, he still ranked fourth among them.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that he could be defeated by someone who was in the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. But seeing that he was easily knocked down by Zheng with just one blow, it created an instant fear among the rest of the practitioners. Their confidence gradually faded that no one dared to make the next move.</p>

  <p>They still couldn't understand how Zheng did it considering that Mason's strength and power were beyond his.</p>

  <p>Fred was also stunned to see how Zheng just easily knocked down Mason with just one blow.</p>

  <p>He knew Zheng better than anyone who was chasing Zheng right now. He had witnessed Zheng fight with other practitioners at Cloud Hall. Zheng's courage in challenging practitioners in the Elite House had piqued Fred's interest.</p>

  <p>He was only a nature creature then, but he already had that confidence in himself. The Elite House disciples had taken Zheng's confidence as arrogance and they were offended by his lack of respect towards those who had reached a higher level of cultivation.</p>

  <p>But later, Fred had learned from a trusted source that Zheng didn't want to challenge the Elite House disciples just because he felt like it. He wasn't acting on his free will. The so-called "challenge" was designed by the head of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>But whether it was arrogance or confidence, his competence wasn't something anyone could underestimate. It was indeed rare for a nature creature to challenge Illuminating Soul Realm disciples, but Zheng wasn't the first one to do so. However, the disciples that Zheng had challenged were not ordinary Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners. They were the disciples of Elite House–the creme of the crop. They were the chosen few from over ten thousand practitioners in Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>No one expected that a nature creature would ever challenge the disciples from Elite House.</p>

  <p>However, after Zheng won many challenges, he suddenly disappeared, and no one knew where he went.</p>

  <p>The chief rune master was devastated and angry at the turn of events that he quarreled with the head of the hall several times and insisted on finding Zheng back.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall had sent someone to look for Zheng. No rock was left unturned, but to no avail. Zheng was out of radar. Everyone had lost hope in finding him.</p>

  <p>Of all places, Fred didn't expect to see Zheng again in the Dragon Soar Arena. The last time he had seen Zheng, the latter was only a nature creature. But now, Zheng had already reached the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Fred wasn't surprised at how strong Zheng became, but he was sure that the latter had a lower cultivation base than Mason. But despite that, Zheng was still able to inflict great damages to Mason.</p>

  <p>'What happened to him in the past three months? How was he able to improve so much in a short time? It's amazing! He's really an interesting subject. It's either his competence has significantly improved or the practitioners at the pinnacle of the Illuminating Soul Realm have become weak. Either, Zheng has proved his incredible strength once more!' Fred wondered. He could defeat Mason himself, but not with just one blow as Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Back in the day when Fred was still in the Elite House, he had already sensed something different in Zheng. Fred had seen the great potential in Zheng and believed that the latter was no ordinary disciple. He had foreseen that Zheng would outperform him in the next three or five years.</p>

  <p>Fred was right on everything about Zheng. However, it didn't take Zheng three or five years to do it. Just after three months, Zheng was able to improve himself. And now, he had become what Fred had thought of him.</p>

  <p>Fred had always believed in the spirit of martial arts. But just now, he started to doubt it. He felt frustrated to see Zheng defeating Mason so easily, but there was nothing he could do but to bury his frustration in silence.</p>
