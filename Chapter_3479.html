  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Fuxi had come late for even a moment, they would have already attacked the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>If that were the case, they would have met with the same tragic fate as that of the Separate Abyss race's leader.</p>

  <p>Fuxi nonchalantly scanned the remaining creatures, his eyes barren of all emotions.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source World came to existence because of the compromise made by Li Shan mountain with the other powerful forces years ago. Fuxi had always looked down upon this agreement and never agreed with it.</p>

  <p>With a solemn expression on his face, he took in a deep breath to gather all his strength and announced in a roaring voice, capable of reaching vast distances.</p>

  <p>"Effective today, the Chaotic Source World will remain closed forever. This won't happen in the future. I hereby declare that Li Shan mountain will resume its control over the Icy Snow Province. Now, all of you, make yourselves scarce, and don't make me repeat myself!"</p>

  <p>In the past, the Icy Snow Province was forced to separate from the Li Shan mountain in order to build the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>As of present, some issues had surfaced in the Chaotic Source Sea. The Chaotic Source Spirits in the Source World had all been slaughtered, leaving nothing to vouch for their existence.</p>

  <p>The only thing that remained of the Chaotic Source World was a hollowed-out shell. With no concrete reason left to support the argument of the Chaotic Source World's continued existence, the Icy Snow Province was returned to Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Sensing the growing irritation in Fuxi's voice, the leaders of the powerful forces didn't waste their breaths to protest against it. Instead, they signaled their subordinates before they quietly turned around and left for their respective flying ships without looking back.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Mount followed the people of the Divine Farmer race and set out to head back. Before he left, he stole a quick glance at Luo Zheng as he walked away.</p>

  <p>Mount's mind was clouded with the many questions that remained unanswered, it tugged at his emotions and made him restless. He was curious about what Luo Zheng had experienced in the exiled world.</p>

  <p>And how did Luo Zheng manage to make out of there alive without a scratch?</p>

  <p>Giving in to his curiosity, he had planned to find all his answers by confronting Luo Zheng. However, he soon changed his mind after he witnessed the sullen expression displayed on Fuxi's face. Moreover, there was also a high chance of Luo Zheng not telling him the full truth.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>One by one, the giant flying ships made their exit as they flew into the sky and entered different space channels.</p>

  <p>However, the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace remained in their place and didn't leave with the others.</p>

  <p>They were well aware of the fact that they were now a target of many races.</p>

  <p>And now, after Luo Zheng had displayed the Soaring Snake Sword, their hostility would elevate till it knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>The sword alone was enough to lure the greedy gazes of many people aspiring to possess it as their own. If they had left with the rest of the ships, they would most likely walk right into an ambush.</p>

  <p>Even if Winchell and Qiu Yinhe boasted immense power, they would still fall short of protecting Luo Zheng under the joint siege of many powerful warriors altogether.</p>

  <p>In less than an hour, the once bustling scene of countless flying ships docked at a distance faltered as they all left one after the other.</p>

  <p>The only ones that remained at the gate of the Chaotic Source World were the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the situation, Qiu Yinhe turned to Fuxi and bowed with the utmost respect. "Human Sovereign, would you be kind enough to allow us to stay in the Icy Snow Province for several more days?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi was aware of their ordeal, he understood the concerns expressed by Qiu Yinhe. He waved his hands as if to brush off all his worries and said,</p>

  <p>"That won't be necessary. You do not have to suffer the harsh cold weather of the Icy Snow Province. Instead, why don't you stay at Li Shan mountain for a few days before you leave? Besides, Yan has been missing her brother for a long time."</p>

  <p>After hearing Fuxi's generous offer, the faces of Qiu Yinhe, Winchell, and the others lit up with joy. They cupped their hands to him to express their overflowing gratitude. Feeling satisfied after their successful exchange, the leaders from each mountain gathered their disciples and made their way back to their flying ships.</p>

  <p>Soon, they all set sail in the southwest direction as a group.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain lay in the Pear Province, which was nearly as large as the Icy Snow Province. The vast Li Shan mountain started from the edge of the Pear Province and stretched all the way to the center of the province. Its height was so high that its peak was shrouded with clouds and mist.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the vicinity of the Pear Province, they were already climbing up the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as they crossed the border of the Pear Province, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace lifted their gazes and looked ahead. The sight in front of them made their mouth gape open subconsciously. They stared in the distance, with their faces revealing conflicting expressions of both shock and awe.</p>

  <p>Each of the mountains that stood dominantly in the Bloom Divine Province was frighteningly high. Their overwhelming size was the source of pride of the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. However, the scenery before their eyes made the ones from the Taiyi Heaven Palace pale in comparison.</p>

  <p>After all, Li Shan mountain was almost the same size as the province itself. Though it claimed itself a hill only, it actually had the largest mountain found in the Source World within its boundaries.</p>

  <p>Slowly yet gradually, seven flying ships of the Taiyi Heaven Palace dominated the skies as they entered the perimeters of the province.</p>

  <p>Following the arrangement of the Li Shan mountain, they berthed near the Sunset Ravine.</p>

  <p>The Sunset Ravine was decorated with various flower-strewn meadows and verdant trees, whose existence complimented the ravine's beauty and made it appear like a fairyland. Beautiful palaces carved with intricate designs and careful crafting were placed in organized rows. Li Shan mountain had designed a place exquisitely to entertain the guests. And now, this was handed over to the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, to provide them with accommodations for a few days.</p>
