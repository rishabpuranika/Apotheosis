<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2785 Dark Light Torrents </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman weaved her way swiftly through the ice palace in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The huge ice palace expanded to tens of thousands of floors under the ground. There were also countless of rooms and ice pillars that would certainly make one unfamiliar with the place get lost.</p>

  <p>Such numbers of floors and rooms of the huge ice palace might be familiar to the woman, but it wasn't her who built it but someone else.</p>

  <p>After discovering the ice palace at the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region, she wandered in it through the years, which was why it would be easy for her to find the right direction.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>She jumped up and slid along the side of the steps in front of her in spite of the dark surroundings. In an extremely high speed, she moved down to the bottom of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>As she ran, she pressed her hands together to form a unique mark.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>In a flash, an invisible Faith Energy shot down from the sky above the Abyss Demon Region and passed through the mark in her hands to the formless creatures.</p>

  <p>Such a huge amount of Faith Energy had never been used by the woman before. This time served as the first time for her to do so.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy was different from the True Gods' momentum. The momentum produced in the True Gods' inner worlds was also considered the Faith Energy. However, their inner worlds were completely under their control, and each and every one of them could control the Faith Energy in their inner worlds freely.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy she used was owned by Chiyou, and belonged to the divine land. Therefore, for her to utilize and fully control it was naturally more difficult.</p>

  <p>She had taken advantage of it to severely repress the Holy Beings such as Nicholas before luring the crowd into the ice palace.</p>

  <p>The formless creatures were a great help to her.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the Holy Being had become aware that something went wrong. Then she was being chased after.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for her, she could also sense Nicholas' location.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she was more familiar with the ice palace, which put her in a favorable condition. She could get rid of the Holy Beings in a short time.</p>

  <p>It took some time for the formless creatures to clone those people, and during that time, it was not good for her to take actions.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A large block of ice was pierced, and Nicholas rushed to the front.</p>

  <p>"There are only two reasons why you are hiding yourself after luring us in.</p>

  <p>The first reason is that you want to lead us to a special place.</p>

  <p>The second reason is that you can't fight now."</p>

  <p>Once again, darkness had completely engulfed the ice palace. Screeches and grunts resounded as the unknown creatures crawled in every corner.</p>

  <p>They must have been brought here by the woman.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had no idea what the woman was doing and intended to do, but he would never let go of any opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>A spiral of black and white appeared in front of Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>The spiral was spinning madly and helped him move downward twice as fast as he had been.</p>

  <p>He was able to detect that his distance from the woman was only tens of thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>For people having a similar cultivation base just like his, once they found the right direction, they could cover such a distance in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Every crumbled block of ice resounded as Nicholas asked, "Where do you want us to go?"</p>

  <p>The woman, who was still concealed and hidden in the darkness, looked at the collapsed ice and showed an amazed smile on her face. She unhurriedly spoke, "Since you've followed me all the way, keep going. Why are you in such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas broke the last piece of ice and faced the direction of the woman.</p>

  <p>He couldn't see anything in the darkness, but he could depend on his spiritual sense to observe his surroundings.</p>

  <p>What the woman had said made him smile faintly and said, "I like the feeling of controlling everything. I don't know what you want to do, but I have a bad feeling." He pointed at the unknown creatures he sensed behind him and continued, "Either tell me the reason why you are doing this, or show me who you really are."</p>

  <p>The woman was also made up of the Faith Energy, and she had accumulated the Faith Energy for countless years. Once she died, her cultivation would naturally be destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so confident?" The woman sneered.</p>

  <p>"Because you can't fight with me now," Nicholas scorned back and once again took action.</p>

  <p>Two torrents were surrounding him, one black and the other white. The torrents around him formed a special mark of Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>With a slight movement, strong internal momentum came out of his body and merged with a Truth of Divine Dao at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Dark Light Torrents!"</p>

  <p>Following the order, the torrents of black and white rippled and flowed toward the direction of the woman.</p>

  <p>The power of these two torrents wasn't too strong, but when they were slowly rolling, it was as if they had endless secrets hidden within. Whoever got struck would definitely die.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the given attack, the woman was calm. She lightly touched the ice and flew backwards.</p>

  <p>What Nicholas had guessed was right.</p>

  <p>Right now, she still needed to provide Faith Energy for the formless creatures, so she really couldn't cope with his attack. But this didn't mean that she would only passively take the beating.</p>

  <p>"Come on, kids!" she whispered to urge the shadows in the dark as she stepped back.</p>

  <p>Then a burst of baby's cry echoed in the ice palace.</p>

  <p>The moment the ice palace was obscured with darkness, not only the formless creatures were able to come in, but the Devils also had actually infiltrated together with them.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Prowling in the dark, the Devils around her made black spiral ripples.</p>

  <p>Every kind of energy could be transmitted in its own way. For instance, the internal momentum of the Elementary Fire Divine Dao would turn out to be a flame if it was released in the most primitive way, and the internal momentum of the Parting Water Divine Dao would be flowing water.</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear the Devils released was the black spiral ripples.</p>

  <p>As the ripples dived into the water, they would turn into sharp spiral currents.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>An extremely weird sound burst out the moment the spiral ripples clashed with the Dark Light Torrents.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious that the Dark Light Torrents had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>The spiral ripples retreated continuously under their opponents' attack.</p>

  <p>Gaining the upper hand, Nicholas didn't feel happy at all. He still looked grave.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies he generated from the Truth of Divine Dao were limited, but the black spiral ripples were constantly supplemented and had already formed a tall wall.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the spiral ripples had counteracted all the Dark Light Torrents.</p>

  <p>What were the creatures crying in the dark? How could they be so powerful?</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much. Five minutes will be enough."</p>

  <p>Looking at how things had progressed on her side, the woman smiled at the Devils in the darkness. Without giving Nicholas a spare look, she moved and continued to slide down the ice palace.</p>

  <p>She put her hands together all the time, and the Faith Energy was continuously provided to the formless creatures through the mark on her hands.</p>

  <p>It was almost complete. She could clearly feel that the shapes of the formless creatures were almost finalized. She just needed five more minutes until they would take their full shapes.</p>

  <p>The clones being formed had the same strength and even the memories as the Holy Beings. Once complete, they would definitely acknowledge allegiance to her.</p>

  <p>Her plan was a helpless choice.</p>

  <p>However, she held her ground planning and trying for many years, just for this day.</p>

  <p>Obtaining the supreme treasure of belief located at the bottom of the ice palace was definitely a hard task to do.</p>

  <p>She had cloned Sword Chen in the Sea of Meditation for hundreds of thousands of times, but still failed to get the supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>This time, the invasion of the Holy Beings into the forbidden land had actually given her a golden opportunity.</p>

  <p>It took her great efforts to lead the Holy Beings into the ice palace just to have the chance to clone them. She believed that this time, she would succeed.</p>
