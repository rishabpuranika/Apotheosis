<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was clear that Scott was far more powerful than Fiona. As Fiona tried to control her corpse, her movements seemed stiff, like that of a wooden doll? she could barely even walk properly.</p>

  <p>As soon as Scott entered the corpse, he appeared quite naturally, as if the body was his own. After he climbed out, he hopped up and firmly stood on the ground.</p>

  <p>Still, his experience was something to be considered. Having entered the Divine Emperor Secret Land countless times already, Scott was naturally much more skilled than Fiona in controlling corpses.</p>

  <p>When he climbed out, he put a palm to his forehead, revealing an expression of pain.</p>

  <p>At this time, the one in pain was certainly not Alessandro, for he had been dead for many years already? it was Scott who was in great pain, this time.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, in the middle of the platform on the top floor, a stone pillar suddenly began to rise.</p>

  <p>Crunch, crunch, crunch?</p>

  <p>The pillar was at least twenty feet wide. While it had always been in the center of the platform, having itself suddenly appear came as a shock to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other Soul Sea Realm masters, however, seemed to be used to it.</p>

  <p>As the pillar slowly rose up, Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed in more confusion.</p>

  <p>Four table-sized rivets were in the middle of the pillar. Similarly, four pitch-black chains were hanging on the end of the rivets, extending toward a coffin in the middle, keeping it locked tight.</p>

  <p>This coffin was rather unique. With its azure color, it was a transparent, crystal coffin!</p>

  <p>Since it was embedded in the stone pillar, tightly locked by chains, the person inside couldn't lie down properly. At that moment, she was standing inside the coffin.</p>

  <p>Inside it was a young girl, dressed in thin, white, unlined clothes. Her bare legs were firmly locked in place by the black chains extending to the crystal coffin.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful young lady! Who is she?" the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom muttered as he gazed upon the girl inside.</p>

  <p>Indeed, while he was used to seeing beautiful women every day, he still couldn't help but marvel at the girl's beauty.</p>

  <p>Looking at her for a short while, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't figure out what was going on in front of them.</p>

  <p>While everyone had their eyes fixed on her, her eyes suddenly opened.</p>

  <p>Her golden orbs then fixed down on everyone.</p>

  <p>"Ahh?"</p>

  <p>Even Fiona was carefully examining the girl. Women tended to be extremely sensitive to looks, even when it came to a mere corpse.</p>

  <p>The corpse that Fiona occupied was elegant, but its beauty still didn't match that of the soul occupying it. But the young girl's corpse was even more beautiful than Fiona.</p>

  <p>Catching the young girl in the act of opening her eyes shocked Fiona speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Calla, and even the other warriors were rather scared. Only the other Soul Sea Realm masters showed no surprise, having witnessed the scene every time they entered the place before. But a flash of worry could be seen in their eyes as they looked at Alessandro's corpse, occupied by Scott.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Scott was clutching his head as he staggered along the platform.</p>

  <p>Although he seemed to be in pain earlier, he managed to hold his head when the girl opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>While still stumbling around, Scott slowly approached. All of a sudden, he unconsciously fell to his knees, allowing his forehead to hit the ground.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the corpse was extremely powerful? not only was his head left uninjured, but it managed to crack the area it made an impact on.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, massive pressure was released from the young girl's body. But this force was directed only at Scott.</p>

  <p>"You are the brave warrior of the Dragon Lineage Human. Since you have recovered, do not forget your mission and become a zombie?</p>

  <p>Answer my question? what is your name?" she asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Name?" Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows in surprise as he remembered Turner's words. 'Could it be that they couldn't remember the names?'</p>

  <p>Alessandro Feng was his name, and he was a known Soul Sea Realm master before his death. Perhaps, Scott could remember it easily.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Scott banged his head on the ground and continued making mournful sounds as he uttered, "My name? my name is?"</p>

  <p>"Alessandro Feng! Your majesty, it's Alessandro Feng!"</p>

  <p>"Alessandro..." several of the Soul Sea Realm masters reminded.</p>

  <p>Even though they were shouting, Scott seemed unable to hear them. In a vague voice, he cried out, "My name is? Ales? My name is?"</p>

  <p>The word 'Alessandro' seemed too difficult for him to say, at that point.</p>

  <p>"Tell me. Tell me what your name is," the young girl flatly repeated.</p>

  <p>"Ah?" Helpless, Scott grew increasingly miserable. "My name is? my name is?"</p>

  <p>Once again, the girl asked, "Say your name or I will treat you as a person who has lost himself! I will reject your recovery!"</p>

  <p>"My name is Scott Lu!" In the end, he couldn't say 'Alessandro'. But at the very least, he managed to utter his name.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were filled with disappointment at the scene.</p>

  <p>Regretfully, Turner commented, "Alas. He failed this time."</p>

  <p>After the name was announced, the young girl inside the crystal coffin gave her judgment, "You've already lost yourself."</p>

  <p>When she finished speaking, Alessandro's corpse began to tremble violently before Scott's soul was forced out of the body.</p>

  <p>After his soul was ejected, Alessandro's corpse began moving, heading straight for his own coffin to lie back down.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the young girl slowly closed her eyes again. While the warriors present couldn't feel any breath or life vitality from the girl, she undoubtedly had her eyes open as if she were alive? it was truly strange.</p>

  <p>As Scott's soul gently floated in the air, a trace of regret surfaced on his face. "Alas. This woman's will is just too difficult for me to resist. When her will enveloped me? I couldn't remember the name? Wind, how did you manage to say the name?"</p>

  <p>Forcing a smile, War King Wind replied, "I've already told you many times, I really don't have any impression of it. I don't even know how I answered. Maybe I was just lucky enough to say the right name by chance!"</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Luo Zheng truly understand.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Dragon Lineage Humans didn't expect the four divine kingdoms to use the Soul Cores to manipulate their corpses? they still kept the corpses of the top masters to deal with some of their other affairs. But as the corpses were preserved in such a way, it was extremely likely that they would become zombies.</p>

  <p>To avoid this situation, the Dragon Lineage Human set up a method to deal with this in the cemetery. If the corpse really became a 'zombie, ' then the young girl would test the corpse's mind. If that body didn't pass the test, then the soul would be ejected straight out of the corpse.</p>

  <p>However, they had never expected that the souls that were removed belonged to human beings.</p>

  <p>"Don't be discouraged. Scott, can you try again?" War King Wind tried to comfort him.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Scott responded, "Well, I'll go to the twelfth floor and choose a corpse. Wind, Turner, Lucien, you can have a try!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Soul Purifying Light on the stairs faded away before Scott shot toward the twelfth floor.</p>

  <p>With that, War King Wind and Turner looked at each other. "Okay, let me do it this time!" War King Wind exclaimed.</p>

  <p>With that, he circled the platform. Instead of choosing Alessandro's corpse, he stopped on top of a black coffin.</p>

  <p>When War King Wind's soul stopped, a Soul Sea Realm master behind him said, "This is the leader of the Dragon Lineage Human from seventy thousand years ago. His name is Henk Feng? it's easier to remember his name."</p>
