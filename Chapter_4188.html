<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As an excellent weapon refining material, the Shade Stones caused fights among warriors every time they appeared in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Even this time was no exception...</p>

  <p>Although the Blood Sea Province was relatively desolate, it used to be a territory of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>When the Shade Stone appeared out of nowhere, dozens of warriors at the Other Shore Realm scrambled to get close to it?gathering in a circle surrounding it.</p>

  <p>"In just two months, two Shade Stones have appeared in the Source World..."</p>

  <p>"Who will take this Shade Stone?"</p>

  <p>"Should we hand it over to the Ji Clan?"</p>

  <p>Although Xuanyuan had been killed and the Bearing race scarcely annihilated, the Evil God didn't kill the entire clan. The Ji Clan was left standing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, one of the warriors from the crowd started to tremble.</p>

  <p>The other warriors were struck with fear as they watched him. The Evil God had once come to the Blood Sea Province to slaughter, and had occupied many people's bodies. Several warriors at the Other Shore Realm had been possessed by the Evil God, so they easily recognized what was happening.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the warrior transformed into the looks of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Hand it over to the Ji Clan?" The Evil God raised his eyebrows at the warrior who said it.</p>

  <p>The warrior felt chills across his body as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.</p>

  <p>"N-no, of course, we'll hand it over to you..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God snorted faintly and looked at the Shade Stone in deep thought.</p>

  <p>He showed a confused look and stared at the warrior. The warrior's body shook continuously, and before he could even speak, his body turned into another Evil God.</p>

  <p>"The Shade Stone is said to be used as a timer. It recently appeared so frequently. Does this mean that the chaotic era is nearing its end?" the Evil God asked threateningly.</p>

  <p>"That should be the case..." the second Evil God replied.</p>

  <p>"But the chaos has already undergone a drastic change. In what way will it come to an end?"</p>

  <p>"No one can predict..."</p>

  <p>"Let the master ask the Bird Masters. Maybe they know."</p>

  <p>"Well, what I care about isn't the end of chaos. Since the Snake Spirit King wants to complete the downgrade, he must have considered the possible end of the chaos. What I'm curious about are the shadows I just saw."</p>

  <p>"Haven't we talked about them last time?" one of the Evil Gods recalled.</p>

  <p>"The Shade Stone itself exists as a timer of the chaos. When it appears, it will cause a disorder in the time sequence. The shadows will then be seen," he added.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. If the time sequence is really out of order, the number of each of our shadows should be the same; but the number of each avatar's shadows and the master's shadows varied greatly. These shadows are probably other versions of ourselves!"</p>

  <p>All the avatars of the Evil God were divided on their opinions of the shadows.</p>

  <p>Some thought that it was just caused by the disorder in the time sequence, while others felt that there were really other 'versions' of themselves.</p>

  <p>These 'versions' were usually hidden within their bodies, and could only be observed when the time sequence was in disorder.</p>

  <p>"So what if they were really other versions of ourselves? They have always existed with us in sync. Normally, we don't even notice them.</p>

  <p>They mean nothing..."</p>

  <p>"As long as they exist, it means something..." one insisted.</p>

  <p>The dilemma also troubled the real Evil God.</p>

  <p>He leaned against the wall listening to the avatars' arguments. He also became confused about the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>This time, the real Evil God felt the excitement from the heart of an avatar. An avatar who was squatting on a corner of the square suddenly burst into laughter, causing the other avatars to look at him puzzledly.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>"Spit it out. What's so funny?"</p>

  <p>"Anything you might want to tell us? Just say it..."</p>

  <p>The avatar sneered, "Those shadows have always been within our bodies and can only be seen when time sequence fluctuates. Do you know why?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" another avatar asked in eager curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Because you are all idiots," the avatar cursed and laughed some more.</p>

  <p>The other avatars resisted their anger, gritting their teeth. "We are all the same. Are you cursing yourself?" one of them retorted.</p>

  <p>They had all come from the same person, with the same character, emotion, and level of intelligence.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the real Evil God in the hall felt a little depressed. Why did the avatar curse so suddenly?</p>

  <p>The avatar stopped laughing and continued, "These shadows are so real.</p>

  <p>We can see them when the time sequence is in disorder, but we can't see them when it is stable. This is because our cultivation of space and time is not enough. If only we had a good mastery of time and space, we could naturally distinguish them."</p>

  <p>It sounded reasonable, but it was undoubtedly nonsense...</p>

  <p>The Evil God's cultivation had reached a peak in the chaos now.</p>

  <p>Not only did he unify the Divine Dao, but he also comprehended six truth-level theurgies. He even used the power of six truth-level theologies to create the more astonishing Six Truths Explosion.</p>

  <p>Putting the Other Shore Tokens and the Eternal Realm bloodlines aside, the Evil God was truly unprecedented and could not be surpassed by anyone, even in the future.</p>

  <p>"But the Ways-blending Energy we cultivated has reached its limit."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a consensus..."</p>

  <p>"There is no possibility of strengthening the space truth any further!" the avatars said one after another.</p>

  <p>The avatar who cursed smiled coldly. "The Bird Master named Duran told us that the chaos is the result of the downgrade of the main world. The energy of the chaos is also from the main world. Although we have never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting, the blood power obtained from it is no different from the energy of the Divine Dao," he said.</p>

  <p>The avatars all kept silent but were somewhat enlightened by his words.</p>

  <p>They were from the same person and their souls were eternally bound. In an instant, they looked at each other as they had understood what the avatar said.</p>

  <p>"The bloodline power of the main world is clearly the same thing as the Ways-blending Energy!" the avatar who cursed exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But the two powers are much too different..." another avatar reminded him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>In the battle in the Blood Sea Province, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer, who were Eternal Realm warriors, displayed their strongest power. This already exceeded Evil God's expectations. If it weren't for the fact that the Evil God could produce as many duplicates at will, it would be hard to say who would win.</p>

  <p>"Of course there is a difference," the avatar who cursed agreed. "But suppose the two are the same thing, we can restore the Ways-blending Energy to see if we can get the bloodline power of the main world," he continued.</p>

  <p>"Restore the Ways-blending Energy to the bloodline power..."</p>

  <p>"This idea is too crazy!"</p>

  <p>"It's impossible!" the avatars disagreed again.</p>

  <p>"Idiots, how would you know if you don't try? No one has ever mastered the complete Ways-blending Energy before!" the avatar cursed once more.</p>

  <p>"Good idea, but you have neglected one thing." The voice of the real Evil God echoed out in the hall. "The Bird Masters are from the main world, and they are born with its bloodline power. I have asked Shera to inquire about the shadows, and they have no idea why the shadows exist either."</p>

  <p>"If we want to see them clearly, we need power stronger than that of the main world. Perhaps we can continue to restore it after we get the bloodline power of the main world..." the avatar suggested. "In the end, all the power will be restored into one kind of energy!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't that still be the Ways-blending Energy?" one avatar interrupted, bringing laughter from all the other avatars.</p>

  <p>However, the real Evil God was not amused. He had a chilling expression drawn on his face.</p>

  <p>Duran had told him about the history of the Four Spirits Sect, and also mentioned a world at a higher level?the Deep Space. This was the same as the avatar deduced.</p>

  <p>Restoring the Ways-blending Energy backward might be an option...</p>

  <p>"You." The real Evil God pointed to the avatar. "Come into the hall," he ordered with a firm voice.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me for?" the avatar asked in shock.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a reward."</p>
