  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, Tate and the Red Demons feared for their lives because of Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Glede Demons were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>In just a short time, the Glede Demon race turned the tables against the Red Demon race and gained the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Of course, Bacchus was very excited. "Of course! We are never on the same side with the Red Demon race!" he said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>All the Glede Demons flapped their wings, and the air became filled with vibrations. They were ready to rush down from the sky at any time.</p>

  <p>As of now, the Red Demons had to face the attacks from both groups.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, those humans still held the Holy Stones in their hands.</p>

  <p>They could not believe that they got reduced to a hopeless situation in a short time!</p>

  <p>Tate's face darkened in anger.</p>

  <p>When he saw that the human race and the Glede Demon race were about to fight, he suddenly waved his hand, and an exit appeared at the side of the birdcage. "Let's go!' he shouted.</p>

  <p>The fire creatures had bestowed the birdcage to him, and he could control it at will.</p>

  <p>The Red Demons had been afraid for a long while, and now that their leader initiated their escape, they would undoubtedly follow.</p>

  <p>Under Tate's command, the Red Demons rushed out of the birdcage.</p>

  <p>This time, he led over a hundred members of the Red Demon race out.</p>

  <p>When Dave and his team had attacked Luo Zheng's group, more than ten of them died. Now, more than eighty people were still alive.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those, Bacchus narrowed his eyes. "You want to leave? It won't be easy!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Then, all the Glede Demons rushed towards the Red Demons below.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Red Demons used the black turtles to protect themselves from the Glede Demons' attacks.</p>

  <p>The black turtles were a powerful defense weapon. The Glede Demons' wings tried to slice them, but it was hard to break through such a defense in a short time.</p>

  <p>At that point, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, and the others came from the other side and launched an attack.</p>

  <p>However, they did not need to kill the Red Demons directly. What they did was to use the Light of Annihilation to remove the black turtles from Red Demons' bodies.</p>

  <p>Streaks of the Light of Annihilation fired through the black turtles and dissipated them.</p>

  <p>Without the black turtles' protection, the Red Demons were at a disadvantage. As soon as the Glede Demons swooped down again, their sharp wings hacked through the Red Demons' bodies like large sabers.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, the Glede Demons had killed more than twenty Red Demons!</p>

  <p>The other Red Demons did not dare to keep fighting anymore. They all rushed towards the exit of the birdcage.</p>

  <p>But before they got out, the exit of the birdcage suddenly closed.</p>

  <p>"Leader?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you close it?"</p>

  <p>"Let us out! Don't abandon us!"</p>

  <p>Only half of the Red Demons that were with Tate had escaped, while there were nearly twenty Red Demons in the birdcage.</p>

  <p>They desperately begged their leader to unlock the door. Even the Red Demons outside the birdcage also looked quite hesitant.</p>

  <p>After all, they were from the same race, and some of them were even biological brothers.</p>

  <p>Tate also hesitated.</p>

  <p>But if he did not close the birdcage, then Bacchus and those human beings would have a chance to go out.</p>

  <p>In the end, he said in a firm voice, "We will leave first, but we will definitely take revenge!"</p>

  <p>Afterward, he led the remaining Red Demons to escape.</p>

  <p>The Red Demons in the birdcage fell into despair. They lost the will to fight, and they died without any resistance.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Bacchus' blade-like wings chopped from top to bottom and split the last Red Demon into two. He wiped the bloodstains on his wings. Then he looked at Luo Zheng and asked, "Is there any way to break through this birdcage?"</p>

  <p>He was not satisfied with the current result.</p>

  <p>If they continued to chase after the Red Demons that escaped, they could kill them and Tate at once.</p>

  <p>All the Red Demons led by Tate were the elites of their race. If all of them died now, then the entire Red Demon race would be eliminated from the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Without directly answering Bacchus, Luo Zheng reached out his hand and touched the birdcage.</p>

  <p>The birdcage had a great space power, and it was not an ordinary Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>If the ancestry-level bloodline in his body could help, then he should not have any problems breaking the birdcage. But the ancestry-level bloodline did not seem to react unless his life was in danger. Thus, he could not count on it.</p>

  <p>He looked at the Snake Goddess and the others, only to find that she and Pearson appeared to communicate in secret.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, can the birdcage be destroyed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think it can," the Snake Goddess answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Then break it now!" Bacchus uttered impatiently.</p>

  <p>"It needs some time," the Snake Goddess explained.</p>

  <p>When he heard those words, Bacchus slightly frowned.</p>

  <p>The Red Demons escaped at a fast speed. If they broke the birdcage now, they would still have a chance to catch up with the Red Demons. If they got delayed for a little more, how could they catch up?</p>

  <p>Now, the Eternal Realm Hunters were very confident that they could break through the birdcage.</p>

  <p>The power of space wove the birdcage. As long as Sawyer and Thurston worked together to use the Black Sun and absorb a part of the birdcage, the entire birdcage would collapse.</p>

  <p>Pearson wanted to destroy the birdcage directly, but the Snake Goddess stopped him.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons were very powerful on the Night View Island. However, the Red Demon race had defeated them because of the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Since they did not have the Holy Stones, they could not control the Light of Annihilation. Thus, they would still fail if they fought the Red Demons again.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the Glede Demon race had no choice but to cooperate with Luo Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>Bacchus was in a hurry to catch up with the Red Demons not only to kill Tate but also to fight for the Holy Stones in their hands.</p>

  <p>Although nearly half of the Red Demons had died, only the remaining alive Red Demons had Holy Stones with them. Bacchus felt disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Can you be faster?" he asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>Just as the Snake Goddess was about to shake her head, pieces of white hairs fell from not far away.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the white-haired monsters could take their time, so she pointed at them to warn the group.</p>

  <p>When Bacchus saw them, he sighed in exasperation.</p>

  <p>Now that the white-haired monsters were there, they definitely could not chase the Red Demons.</p>

  <p>Even if they applied Ghost Powder on their bodies, they would still attract the white-haired monsters when they traveled at night.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, after the battle among the three sides, they had shaken off a lot of Ghost Powder, which naturally attracted many white-haired monsters.</p>

  <p>As soon as the white-haired monsters appeared, they had to stop all their movements. The Glede Demons, Luo Zheng and his group quickly reapplied the Ghost Powder and stayed still.</p>

  <p>These white-haired monsters wandered around the Glede Demons and Luo Zheng's group, but because of the Ghost Powder's protection, they could not see the humans and Glede Demons. Finally, they walked towards the corpses of the Red Demons.</p>

  <p>Those Red Demons just died, so their blood was still a bit fresh. Even their corpses emitted powerful life energy.</p>

  <p>The white-haired monsters devoured them. After they finished, they left some Arcana behind and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Because Bacchus and the others got delayed for a while, Tate and his group had already gone far. Now, Bacchus was no longer in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess and her group wanted to stall for more time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they did not destroy the birdcage so quickly.</p>

  <p>Pearson's hands turned into thin threads and pretended to coil them around the birdcage.</p>

  <p>Fuxi also condensed marks of Eight Diagrams in different sizes on the birdcage.</p>

  <p>After they pretended to be busy for some time, Sawyer and Thurston finally operated the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>The Black Sun's strong gravitational force sucked a part of the birdcage into it. The originally square birdcage looked a little distorted, but it still maintained its entire shape.</p>

  <p>Then, Sawyer and Thurston separated their hands, and the Black Sun disappeared.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>It destroyed the balance of space force inside the birdcage with a muffled sound, and then the space birdcage collapsed.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons were surprised when they saw the broken birdcage.</p>

  <p>These extremely arrogant Glede Demons had never allied with anyone on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>They had always been quite strong and did not need help from the other races, but now they needed help from these humans.</p>
