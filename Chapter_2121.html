<br/><br/>

  

  <p>However, although Woolley was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, the sword skills he used were rather ordinary. It was just a variant of the basic swordsmanship, which was far less flexible. Woolley would be easily defeated by most warriors from Zheng's universe when it was about swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Zheng pondered over it. Curious eyes painted his face. Immediately, he quickly understood the reasons. The divine citizens were born with spectacular strength. If they could absorb the vitality between heaven and earth in the divine land and advance in their cultivation levels, they could open up their Soul Sea and become a Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warriors in the divine land had equivalent status to nature creatures in the Lower World of Zheng's universe. Additionally, they had just started their martial path. As a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, Woolley was only slightly stronger than an ordinary person. He was a villager of a remote village, so it was incredible enough that he could reach the Spirit Transformation Realm. It was nearly impossible for him to get any advanced sword skills to learn. The distance of the village to civilization had hindered any advanced sword techniques to be integrated by its warriors.</p>

  <p>Along with Woolley, a group of children also diligently practiced.</p>

  <p>The kids probably couldn't get a sword, so they could only use branches and sticks instead. However, their determination was still apparent in children's expressions. They were quite serious as they imitated Woolley's movements.</p>

  <p>'These branches should be valuable enough to exchange for a high-quality sacred weapon in our universe.'</p>

  <p>As this thought passed through his mind, Zheng smiled softly. No matter where he went, there were always people who were dedicated to the martial arts. With a calm and appreciative expression, he walked down the stairs of the house.</p>

  <p>"Be serious! Adjust your stance properly!" As he noticed Zheng's presence, Woolley started to wave the sword in his hand even harder. Nonetheless, the children failed to keep up with his rhythm and all reeled right and left. There was only one child who could barely catch up with Woolley's movements. He was the boy who carried Zheng out of the vegetable field the night before.</p>

  <p>Zheng already knew that the boy's name was Thomson, Additionally, he was Woolley's younger brother.</p>

  <p>As he noticed Woolley's messy footsteps, Zheng stood with his hands behind his back and approached Woolley. With a callous face, he said indifferently, "You should learn to move swiftly before you learn how to use the sword. The words 'stride squarely' in your chant is wrong. The sword can be used flexibly in a fight. If one only strides squarely, it will affect the flexible movements of the hands. If the sword loses its flexibility, then what is the need for learning it? You might as well use a spear instead!"</p>

  <p>Although his words sounded harsh and direct, Zheng was more than qualified to make such comments on swordsmanship. His battle experience and prowess were above anyone in the village.</p>

  <p>However, Woolley, with his back to Zheng, suddenly winked at his younger brother. A small message was secretly shared between the two.</p>

  <p>As he received his brother's signal, Thomson dropped the wooden sword in his hand and turned to Zheng. With a pouty face, he said, "Humph, what nonsense are you spouting? My brother's swordsmanship was learned from Mirror City. This set of sword skills is very extraordinary. Why do you criticize it so severely?"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow. When he pushed open the door and saw how poorly Woolley practiced swordsmanship with the group of kids, he already realized it was just for show. Woolley and the others originally wanted Zheng to teach them some sword skills. Since Zheng was a warrior from outside the village, they considered his knowledge to be beneficial to them.</p>

  <p>With playful eyes, Zheng stared at Thomson. Although he still wore a smile on his face, Zheng emitted a faint aura. The aura was not meant to kill anyone, but it was enough to make the boy feel some pressure.</p>

  <p>Despite Thomson's smart mind, his expression immediately turned frantic and his face paled when Zheng stared at him tightly. The faint aura released by Zheng had intimidated everyone in the field. Even the other children also looked at Zheng in a daze with fears on their faces.</p>

  <p>As he saw the children's nervous expressions, Zheng's heart softened. Why did he have to blame a group of children? He turned to Woolley and said,</p>

  <p>"If you want any guidance from me, you can just say it directly. I'm not a stingy person, so you don't have to do this just to trick me into teaching you. I am more than willing to help you improve your skills."</p>

  <p>When Woolley and the children heard this, their faces were filled with a pleasant surprise. They had rehearsed for a long time for this moment.</p>

  <p>They wanted to prod Zheng to teach them as they displayed pathetic swordsmanship. However, it was actually fine for Zheng to be their master.</p>

  <p>It seemed that they had wasted all their efforts...</p>

  <p>In the divine land, cultivation was not something that normal divine citizens could engage in. They couldn't easily attain the necessary requirements to improve their cultivation.</p>

  <p>There just weren't enough accessible pills, cultivation methods, resources, and even masters...</p>

  <p>To the divine citizens, those were things that they couldn't even reach. As such, the Godly Way Tablets for cultivation were only a legend to most divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was not a True God, as a proving godly warrior, he could still be a good teacher to them. However, they had never thought that Zheng would agree to teach them so easily. All of them started to form a sense of admiration towards him.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had finished his words, he took a step forward and waved his hand toward Thomson. The wooden sword in the boy's hand suddenly flew into Zheng's hand. Thomson revealed a surprised expression.</p>

  <p>Although this wooden sword was a toy for a child, it actually weighed over ten thousand pounds. Thomson was only seven or eight years old but he was still a divine citizen. His strength could not be measured by the standard of the universe. A divine citizen would naturally be born with spectacular strength compared to secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>"To learn to use a sword, you should learn to move swiftly first. Take a good look!"</p>

  <p>As he finished his remarks, Zheng took a step forward and started to shift left and right. He was using the Sword Step that he hadn't used in a long time. Incredible footwork was witnessed by Woolley and the children.</p>
