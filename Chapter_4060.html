<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4060 Snake Master </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Most of the time, the members of the Element Spirit race had no concept of individuality.</p>

  <p>For the most part, they worked as a collective and were indistinct from each other.</p>

  <p>However, when an element's life expanded to a certain extent, it inevitably formed a unique individual. Otherwise, their strength would become stagnant and stop growing.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Eye Spirit had informed Claire that he was actually composed of countless members of the Element Spirit race and was infused with an independent consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had been created by those snakes on the Jade Pure Realm, while the subsequent members of the Element Spirit race had been formed directly or indirectly by the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Eye Spirit formed the foundation of the Element Spirit Civilization, while the snakes were the foundation of the Eye Spirit!</p>

  <p>For a long time, even the Eye Spirit had been unaware of the existence of those snakes...</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of the Eye Spirit, the Element Spirit Civilization had flourished. They continued to explore the upper stages, the Three Purities Stage, and the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>They had earned the strongest Other Shore Tokens and even captured many creatures from beyond the Abstruse Energy World!</p>

  <p>The strange world made up of light dots had proven difficult to understand, but the mystery about it made it all the more fascinating.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the members of the Element Spirit race had natural inhibitions, so it was difficult for them to explore it to the furthest reaches.</p>

  <p>Over the past one thousand chaotic eras or more, warriors rose? one after another? to challenge them, and they were each eliminated by the Element Spirit Civilization. Except for the strongest of their opponents, the human race who had been forced to escape into the Night View Island, almost all other civilizations had been defeated by them.</p>

  <p>They had remained the absolute and dominating authority until the Nihility race had appeared.</p>

  <p>Before the appearance of the Nihility race, the Treacherous Beings had also begun making inroads into the Jade Pure Realm, and an unprecedented chaotic battle had even erupted within the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>In the Element Spirit race, none but the Eye Spirit had participated in the chaotic battle.</p>

  <p>Later, he returned to the Jade Pure Realm, together with the white snake, but the snake commanded a force more powerful than anyone could have imagined.</p>

  <p>Claire was confused when she heard the Eye Spirit's revelation.</p>

  <p>How could such a powerful force have been hidden in the Jade Pure Realm for so many years without anyone noticing?</p>

  <p>She later discovered that this powerful force had long been annihilated, and the last remnants of it were now living in the form of Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>In essence, once this force appeared, the Element Spirit Civilization would reinforce their control over the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that a bird in the Jade Pure Realm would support the Grandmaster of Heaven, who in turn led the members of the Nihility race to battle the Element Spirit Civilization even now?</p>

  <p>At the little white snake's reproachful words, the Eye Spirit's emotions remained unfazed. He only calmly replied, "The Void Dust has a huge appetite. I'm afraid it will take much longer time. I wonder if you have a better suggestion, Snake Master."</p>

  <p>"Give up now," the Snake Master said.</p>

  <p>As soon as these words were spoken, both Claire and the Eye Spirit were stunned.</p>

  <p>That Divine Dao was of the utmost importance.</p>

  <p>And they were just quitting so easily?</p>

  <p>"Why?" Claire couldn't help asking for clarification.</p>

  <p>The Snake Master suddenly raised his head, and his eyes shone with a green light.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Claire felt as if her brain had been struck by a sledge hammer, and her face contorted in pain.</p>

  <p>The intense pain rendered her unable to maintain her form. Cracks appeared all over her body. With a snapped fizzle and several sparks, she transformed into a ball of flames, revealing her original form.</p>

  <p>"You have no right to question me," the Snake Master said coldly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh?</p>

  <p>The flames simmered down, and then reconstructed a white skin and body, and Claire resumed her old appearance.</p>

  <p>She swallowed the pain and knelt down to the Snake Master.</p>

  <p>A trace of anger lingered in the Eye Spirit's eyes, but he made no comment.</p>

  <p>He had carefully concealed his anger deep inside.</p>

  <p>The Snake Master had a dominating aura.</p>

  <p>The twin creatures and the fury flame, formerly cultivated by the Eye Spirit, were all killed by the Snake Master because of a single sentence.</p>

  <p>Les had almost died at the hands of the Snake Master. Although he had released Les because the Eye Spirit had begged him to spare his life, the Snake Master had banned Les from merging with any Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>He even refused to tell him the method for using the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>"Why?" the Eye Spirit repeated Claire's question.</p>

  <p>"The Night View Island is very important," the Snake Master replied.</p>

  <p>"Because of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings dwelling in the Ghost Mountain?" the Eye Spirit once again questioned.</p>

  <p>To his knowledge, there were hatred-level Treacherous Beings in existence in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Hatred-level Treacherous Beings..." The Snake Master sneered, "They are an insignificant concern!"</p>

  <p>"Then it is to kill those humans?" the Eye Spirit continued asking.</p>

  <p>"Humans?" The Snake Master sneered with more contempt, "They are hardly even worth mentioning!"</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit gave up questioning then.</p>

  <p>Although he had already discovered some secrets concerning the existence of the Four Spirits Sect through the Snake Master, he was unclear about the grudges involved. After all, these were things that had happened beyond the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Do you recall the wolf teeth I gave you?" the Snake Master asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do!" His eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>Those were very special.</p>

  <p>There was a sum of ten wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>Each of them radiated a complex and powerful bloodline aura.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had speculated often that these wolf teeth had to be really powerful treasures. The bloodline power of each wolf tooth could be directly used and freely altered.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when the Snake Master had given these wolf teeth to the Eye Spirit, they had been seriously damaged.</p>

  <p>The surface of these teeth was marred and covered with thin cracks as if the wolf teeth were close to shattering should he exert any pressure on them.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power within the wolf teeth had eventually dissipated, leaving only a faint aura?</p>

  <p>The Snake Master revealed nothing of the origins and uses of these wolf teeth, but he had asked him to keep them safe.</p>

  <p>At the Snake Master's sudden mention of them, the Eye Spirit was naturally interested.</p>

  <p>"Take the wolf teeth to the Ghost Mountain. You must find a way to wake him up," the Snake Master instructed.</p>

  <p>"Whom are you speaking of?"</p>

  <p>"Orlando.</p>

  <p>One of the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King!"</p>

  <p>When the Eye Spirit heard this, the spirals in his eyeballs rotated crazily.</p>

  <p>The shock to his heart instantly reflected on the surface of his pupils.</p>

  <p>Anyone who looked into his eyes could see the violent shock in his heart.</p>

  <p>Claire glanced at the Eye Spirit and was also surprised.</p>

  <p>Who was this Monkey Spirit King that the Snake Master was talking about?</p>

  <p>How could he have shocked the Eye Spirit so severely?</p>

  <p>The Snake Master had shared many secrets with the Eye Spirit, though he did not allow the Eye Spirit to share these. Even Claire, who was closest to him, remained uniformed concerning these secrets.</p>

  <p>Of course, she didn't know what this Monkey Spirit King was...</p>

  <p>"These wolf teeth are his obsession. Relinquish them to him, and then I will appear," the Snake Master said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the Eye Spirit ordered Gavyn to remove the rune.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As the Eye Spirit's pupils slightly enlarged, the cubic space enveloping this area vanished.</p>

  <p>The ground marked off by the cubic space fell into the big hole eroded by the mist hand.</p>

  <p>The Holy Wings Armor, Claire, and Eye Spirit flew northeast, while the Snake Master remained behind.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss?</p>

  <p>The Snake Master wriggled his white body and slithered to the entrance of the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>The light in his eyes flashed slightly, and two rays of orange light beamed into the white mist formed by the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>The white mist could devour any substance and even energy, and by all logical sense, it should consume the orange rays of light.</p>

  <p>However, the orange rays of light remained unaffected. Instead, they stirred the white mist, which then roiled and suddenly burst forth with a series of obscure and rhythmic songs. It was Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>"You stupid birds proclaimed yourselves as destroyers. You are clueless to cause or effect, therefore, you will definitely lose!"</p>
