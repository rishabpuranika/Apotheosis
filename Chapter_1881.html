<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng almost rolled his eyes--he wasn't interested in seizing the platform at all. While the Pristine Life Vitality was quite mysterious as it was similar to the strength source, it was completely meaningless to him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he didn't have any reason to help Liusu, who had even stirred up trouble on purpose.</p>

  <p>However, Quentin had been too overbearing and had compromised Lucille and the others. Thus, Zheng had no choice but to take action.</p>

  <p>Silence hung like a thick blanket on the platform, as the warriors looked on in disagreement.</p>

  <p>The tension was palpable. After all, this group of people had been quite dominant even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was simply because they thought that the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land wasn't anything special. They didn't expect that an arrogant secondary creature like Zheng would be there as well.</p>

  <p>They could temporarily stop the absorption of the Pristine Life Vitality, but they'd be humiliated if they left just like that. It was truly embarrassing to be driven away by a secondary creature, and they would become laughing stocks if this matter spread to the divine land in the future.</p>

  <p>Then again, they had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng could easily defeat warriors like Quentin. Warriors of his caliber were no match for Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before a warrior from another race took the initiative to leave the platform with a dejected look on his face.</p>

  <p>After that, the rest of the warriors followed suit.</p>

  <p>After a blink of an eye, all the warriors on the platform were gone. The only ones left were Zheng, Lucille, Kurt, Lone, and the two girls from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"You have to leave as well," Zheng muttered to Liusu and her sister.</p>

  <p>Liusu was stunned. "Why are you driving me away?" she said in a shaky voice.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Liusu's sister cast her a helpless look. She didn't expect that the person her sister found to help her would drive her away as well.</p>

  <p>"All of this started because of you--but since I've taken this platform, I get to decide who stays behind," Zheng coldly responded.</p>

  <p>"I'm not leaving," Liusu said and pursed her lips. She didn't care about the black crystals. She only asked him to teach Quentin a lesson and now that he was about to drive her away, she felt quite embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Lone tried to persuade Zheng and said, "Zheng, it doesn't matter if these two stay. The platform has enough Pristine Life Vitality."</p>

  <p>Everyone left behind had witnessed the whole process. Although they didn't know what Liusu and Quentin's relationship was, they had a rough guess based on the talk they had heard. The most important thing was that Lone had learned about the Han Clan's position in the divine land through his broken sword.</p>

  <p>It was one thing for Zheng to have already offended Quentin, but Liusu seemed to have fallen in love with Zheng. No matter what their relationship was, Zheng couldn't offend another big clan for no reason at all.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is highly talented. He is a rare talent even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, his EQ is really low, so we'd better persuade him," the broken sword whispered to Lone.</p>

  <p>There was no way that Zheng would allow the two sisters of the Han Clan to stay with them. Just as he was about to say something to Lone, they suddenly heard a voice from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Private duels are prohibited here. Violators are expelled! Who was causing trouble here?"</p>

  <p>The booming voice echoed throughout the area as a group of people appeared in the clouds, led by Isaiah from the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had driven away all the warriors from the divine land, the Skyland race finally appeared.</p>

  <p>Isaiah flew in the air before he led six of his clansmen onto Zheng's platform. He raised a fine brow as he glared at Zheng. "Who was causing trouble here? Don't you know the rules of my race?" he said in a sharp, aggressive tone.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng just looked mockingly at Isaiah.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Isaiah knew that Quentin was about to kill Zheng, but he didn't stop him. Nevertheless, he had shown up personally on the platform when he saw Zheng kick Quentin and his group into the black water. In reality, he wanted to restrain Zheng on the excuse of the so-called rules.</p>

  <p>It was known that Isaiah was thick-skinned enough to show his favoritism towards warriors from the divine land.</p>

  <p>"You knew that Quentin was going to attack me, right? Don't you remember what Quentin said to you?" Zheng sneered. However, Isaiah's face remained impassive.</p>

  <p>Since the Skyland race had received a great deal of favor from the Qin Clan, he naturally had to side with the warriors from the divine land. He thought that Zheng was a secondary creature. Where did he come from anyway?</p>

  <p>At that moment, they heard a voice in the distance. "Sir, it was that guy who kicked us into black water!" a martial artist from the divine land shouted.</p>

  <p>Those martial artists that Zheng had kicked out into the black water swam and climbed onto another platform, but for some reason, Quentin couldn't be seen among them.</p>

  <p>The accusation was what Isaiah had waited for. He wouldn't listen to Zheng's explanation. He then slipped into an act and said, "It really is you!</p>

  <p>Nothing can be accomplished without norms or standards. Since you've broken the rules of my race, you should leave on your own, or I'll kick you out!"</p>

  <p>His words caused Lucille and the others to worry and panic internally.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an issue if they provoked those martial artists from the divine land because all of them were foreign martial artists.</p>

  <p>However, the people who were making everything tense were from the Skyland race, and they did so in their territory.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Zheng was, he couldn't possibly disobey the orders of the Skyland race, could he?</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had defeated these people from the Skyland race, how did he plan to fight the race's actual powerful warriors?</p>

  <p>Lone sighed in silence. He had already expected this would be the biggest problem.</p>

  <p>"Hah! I knew that this guy wouldn't act so violently in the presence of the Skyland race!"</p>

  <p>"They shouldn't go against this group of martial artists from the divine land. We all know what's going to happen. Even if they win, they'll still be driven away!"</p>

  <p>"What's even worse is that since Zheng has provoked these people, the Qin Clan will hunt him down if he leaves the Skyland race. The Qin Clan is powerful in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>Hushed whispers and chatters about Zheng's situation were heard from the crowd.</p>

  <p>The truth was, many of them were initially happy when Zheng had made his first move. After all, they had been oppressed by the group of martial artists from the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, they suddenly felt bitter when they saw that Zheng had helped Lone and the others seize a platform.</p>

  <p>Then again, such was human nature. When they couldn't get something, they hoped that others wouldn't be able to either.</p>

  <p>"Rules?" Zheng chuckled. "So it's not a violation of rules when these martial artists from the divine land attacked, but I broke the rules when I tried to defend?"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Isaiah just squinted at Zheng and laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you say!"</p>

  <p>He was certain that Zheng wouldn't dare to pick a fight with him, so he didn't want to argue any further.</p>

  <p>If Zheng fought against the warriors from the other races, he would be expelled from the Skyland race. If he dared to fight against the Skyland race, it would result in his possible death. Therefore, Isaiah was confident that Zheng wouldn't be that stupid to fight him.</p>

  <p>After all, this was the territory of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I wonder which idiot set such lousy rules," Zheng slowly walked towards Isaiah as he spoke, and then continued, "I'm not an idiot, so I won't abide by the rules!"</p>

  <p>With every step Zheng took, the killing intent in his fiery eyes grew stronger. Isaiah was a bit flustered at this unexpected outcome. Would Zheng really dare to fight him?</p>

  <p>Isaiah wasn't exceptionally strong in the Skyland race and was merely on par with the Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists. He had been hiding and when he witnessed Zheng's divine might just now, he knew that he was no match for Zheng. Thus, he quickly decided to rely on the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>But he never thought that Zheng wasn't afraid of the Skyland race at all!</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Skyland race already knew about the Collapsing Mountain race's visit, but due to the strict hierarchy within the race, they didn't know that Zheng also came along with the Collapsing Mountain race, nor did they know that Zheng was the flame-proof warrior.</p>

  <p>Isaiah was even more unaware that Zheng had humiliated Kaydan, the head of the Skyland race, yesterday.</p>

  <p>It was because Isaiah wasn't a significant figure in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Why would Zheng be afraid of him then?</p>

  <p>Zheng got closer to Isaiah, and his aura became more powerful. Panic started to show on Isaiah's face while two of the Skyland race's clansmen began to retreat.</p>

  <p>"You... This is the Skyland race. Whoever doesn't follow the rules will..."</p>

  <p>Isaiah stuttered. The truth was, he wasn't confident enough and he was full of regret. If he had known that this would happen, he would've asked the elders to come.</p>

  <p>"I will be expelled, right? You have repeated that several times," Zheng said with a smile. "Then let's see if you have the ability to do so!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng had finished speaking, he immediately sped up and made the first move.</p>

  <p>These warriors of the Skyland race previously came to the platform in all their arrogant glory, but now they fled away in panic like a flock of disturbed birds.</p>

  <p>However, Isaiah couldn't escape since he was the group's leader. His eyes widened in horror as Zheng forcefully gripped his collar and smashed him onto the platform.</p>
