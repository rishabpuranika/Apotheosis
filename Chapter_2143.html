<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After collecting the divine might coins, Luo Luo Zheng quickly headed north, still under Master Evil's guidance.</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered the divine land, Luo Luo Zheng tried to get an overview of the place. It had been quite difficult to gain any insight back when he was still in the Misty Mountain Village since its inhabitants weren't well-travelled and the farthest they'd ever been to was Mirror City.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had been locked up in the dungeon for seven divine eras so his information was mostly outdated. Fortunately, his knowledge and experience were still quite comprehensive.</p>

  <p>"I just don't understand why a top figure like Harold won't directly pick you up?"</p>

  <p>In Master Evil's eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was a proud son of a Holy Being. His lineage and talent were enough to directly send him to the wealthy and influential clans on the Floating Islands. Even if the Floating Island built by Mike had been destroyed, with Harold's connections, it would not be difficult for him to send Luo Luo Zheng to the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also knew his father's disciples still played an active role. At the very least, they took very good care of Yan.</p>

  <p>However, due to Wynn's arrangement, Luo Luo Zheng could only adapt to the situation and rely on himself.</p>

  <p>"I think your first aim is to enter a wealthy and influential clan on a certain Floating Island!" Master Evil advised. The Floating Island was a place everyone in the divine land yearned for. A warrior such as Master Evil simply did not have the qualifications to enter such a place.</p>

  <p>"Floating Island? What kind of place is it exactly?" Luo Luo Zheng had heard Wynn mention it back in the Evolutionary Universe but he didn't really elaborate much on it.</p>

  <p>Master Evil sighed. Luo Luo Zheng was Mike's son and Bromley's disciple, but it was amazing just how little Luo Luo Zheng knew about the divine land. "In the middle of the divine land is a vast sea called the Time Sea... The sea is formed by light and time, and any living being who falls onto this sea will be split by different time. I once walked by the sea. It is extremely dangerous! In the center of the Time Sea are the Floating Islands built and constructed by powerful, wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>These Floating Islands are naturally built by Holy Beings of the divine land. Only Holy Beings have the qualifications to establish a Floating Island so each Floating Island represents a peak-level power of the divine land! The wealthy clans that live on the Floating Islands have monopolized around 90% of the resources in the divine land. These include those divine mighty coins.</p>

  <p>Once you enter a Floating Island, you will have a promising future!</p>

  <p>However, it's going to be difficult as you will have to gain the recognition of some powerful clan. It is quite rare for them to accept warriors from other clans. Even I... Not even I was qualified to enter a Floating Island back then!"</p>

  <p>"You weren't qualified?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Which wealthy clan would accept a True God like me with no sort of powerful background?" Master Evil couldn't help but reveal a look of cynicism. Even if he hadn't received the favor of any wealthy clan, he still managed to reach the peak level of a mid-rank True God. That was still something worth being proud of.</p>

  <p>"Enter a Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>As they conversed, Luo Luo Zheng climbed and eventually made it to the top of the mountain. On the peak, he could see the outline of the divine land much more clearly. Now he already got an initial goal.</p>

  <p>A cold wind blew into Luo Zheng's nose. He smiled before jumping down and floating with the wind.</p>

  <p>His travelling speed wasn't too slow but it was still a bummer that he couldn't fly.</p>

  <p>Two and half months later, Luo Luo Zheng slowly found himself arriving north of the Vast Sky Region. He had finally arrived at the first divine city: Mirror City.</p>

  <p>"This divine city is so beautiful!" he couldn't help but remark. When Luo Luo Zheng was still a hundred miles away from Mirror City, he had already caught a glimpse of the entire city.</p>

  <p>As its name implied, the walls of Mirror City were made of a type of polished, silver brick that shone like huge mirror. He didn't need Master Evil to explain anything further as he could see everything with his eyes.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the gates, he was greeted by the sight of a black mass of warriors in front of him.</p>

  <p>There were about more than ten thousand warriors, most of them at the Spirit Transformation Realm. There were also a few Spirit Supreme Realm warriors and proving godly warriors. Right now, it seemed all of them were blocked from entering Mirror City.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet! Come here and register the points you have obtained today!"</p>

  <p>In front of the city gates were ten, black-armored proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Each of them held long whips in their hands as they shouted over the crowd.</p>

  <p>The warriors present immediately clamored and surged towards one direction.</p>

  <p>"What are they doing?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with his mouth wide open, his eyes filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is that easy to enter a divine city?" Master Evil chuckled. "Not everyone can have that privilege!"</p>

  <p>Improving one's cultivation wasn't that difficult here in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Divine citizens could open up their Soul Sea just after they started practicing martial arts and directly become Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Even someone like Woolley in the Misty Mountain Village was able to enter the Spirit Transformation Realm despite having average talent.</p>

  <p>The entire Misty Mountain Village had banded together in order to send him to Mirror City. Unfortunately, it was quite difficult for Woolley to master any high-level martial skill in the city since he didn't even have any basic understanding of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>There were so many divine citizens in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The majority of them would often find themselves stuck at the Soul Sea Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, or Spirit Transformation Realm. Those who were determined to step into the Godly Way would go out and find masters from whom they could study. Only a few people would be lucky enough to find and learn from powerful masters so the vast majority of warriors opted to go to divine cities instead where there were more opportunities.</p>

  <p>However, a divine city's holding capacity was limited. If it opened its gates to everyone then it would be engulfed by a tidal wave of divine citizens. Such things had already happened before.</p>

  <p>Having learned from their mistakes, the divine cities chose to set limitations for those who wanted to enter their walls.</p>

  <p>"The standard rule for most divine cities is to pay a divine might coin to gain entry," Master Evil explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pursed his lips. "It's merely one divine might coin. That's not too much."</p>

  <p>He had hundreds of divine might coins courtesy of Master Evil. Entering the divine city wasn't going to be that difficult for him then.</p>

  <p>"Hehe, do you think it's easy to obtain a divine might coin? Take a look at these warriors. They all need to continuously complete the missions issued to them by the Mirror City. The weaker ones will have to work for tens, maybe even hundreds of years before they gain the qualifications needed to enter the city. All for one divine might coin!" Master Evil explained.</p>

  <p>"A hundred years of hard work in exchange for a divine might coin?"</p>

  <p>This fact shocked Luo Luo Zheng greatly. Now that he finally realized the value of the divine might coins, he suddenly felt as if those small, black, round pieces he carried got heavier.</p>

  <p>A crack suddenly appeared on the city gate. Out came a middle-aged man wearing a fancy robe.</p>

  <p>"A True God?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed upon realization that this middle-aged man was a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>He pointed at a proving godly warrior in the crowd who visibly became very excited and began bowing to him. Afterwards, the chosen proving godly warrior followed the middle-aged man inside the Mirror City.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>The gates closed with a bang and all of those who were left behind wore expressions of unbridled envy on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Those who have a house in the Mirror City can bring three people inside. That middle-aged True God must be a native and the proving godly warrior he brought in with him must be his relative," Master Evil answered.</p>

  <p>"That's allowed?" Luo Luo Zheng was quite dumbfounded with the amount of information he had suddenly been given.</p>

  <p>"Back then, I also had about seven houses in the Mirror City. Ah, but it's a pity. After so many years, they most probably belong to other people now," Master Evil muttered in a wistful tone. "Anyway, let's drop the subject. We should hurry and enter the city as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had divine might coins, he naturally didn't need to work like the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Once he bypassed this group, Luo Luo Zheng managed to squeeze his way to the front of the city gates.</p>

  <p>A guard noticed him and pointed a whip to the side. "Don't you know the rule? Line up over there to receive your task!"</p>

  <p>The blatant rudeness did not anger Luo Luo Zheng, in fact, he was smiling. "I'm not here to do any task. Shouldn't one be able to enter by paying a divine might coin?"</p>
