  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the first cricket was smashed into the air, all the other crickets started moving.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click! Click..."</p>

  <p>The crickets charged forward astonishingly fast. In the blink of an eye, they were firmly wrapped around Luo Zheng. Obviously, they wanted to take advantage of their large numbers to devour him completely.</p>

  <p>But they soon discovered a big problem— their originally invincible mouth parts couldn't seem to tear the prey in front of them, nor could they leave any wounds on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed as he was pressed down at the bottom. Although the black insects couldn't hurt him, he was still rather flustered.</p>

  <p>Then, he rolled up and stomped heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>And the insects under his feet were stomped into the earth.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was in a universe, he would've been able to shake the earth with a single stomp and maybe even a whole valley would've collapsed. But now, he caused only a small hole between the grass and not a single cricket was trampled to death.</p>

  <p>But with the help of this force, Luo Zheng managed to soar straight into the air, shaking off the crickets attached to his body and landing heavily somewhere not too far away.</p>

  <p>These crickets seemed to possess some incredibly powerful concealing abilities, able to avoid the soul power Luo Zheng released. However, their strength was not strong, and they would probably be considered the lowest level of life forms within the divine land...</p>

  <p>Click, click, click…</p>

  <p>When the crickets saw Luo Zheng escape, they all made another leap, spreading their wings and chasing him in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heaved a sigh— he wouldn't be able to walk out this lush and verdant vegetable field in a short time anyway. Since these reckless insects were attacking him, he didn't bother to run away. He would just stay to play with them for a while to kill time.</p>

  <p>Immediately after he closed his eyes, the surface of his soul in his mind flashed with golden light. After it lit up, it instantly spread over the whole surface of his soul. Then, small golden swords began circling Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Apart from using his cinnabar field, Luo Zheng could also use his soul power.</p>

  <p>When the swarm arrived, Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>A golden light suddenly surged from his pupils.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish, swish…</p>

  <p>The golden lights contained sharp auras, all of them like many small invisible arrows. These arrows looked incredibly real and back then, they could even shatter a cliff wall.</p>

  <p>But what made these small arrows truly powerful were their soul attacks.</p>

  <p>The crickets' defensive power was incredibly strong, withstanding the attacks of Zheng's fleshly body. But as the lowest level of creatures, their souls were pitifully weak. Zheng's auras spread far and wide like countless small sharp arrows, shooting out. When an arrow pierced through a cricket's head, it shattered its very soul.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff, puff…</p>

  <p>After the crickets' souls were obliterated, their bodies fell onto the vegetable field— they had no chance of resistance whatsoever.</p>

  <p>One by one, the crickets before Luo Zheng were killed by his 'gaze, ' but the crickets that followed continued to charge.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the cricket corpses turned into a small mountain as they piled up in front of Luo Zheng. They only had their souls destroyed— they weren't completely dead. As their bodies weren't affected, their strong legs still moved and trembled.</p>

  <p>The insects also possessed a certain level of intelligence— seeing how their comrades had suffered heavy casualties, the last few crickets finally understood that Luo Zheng wasn't good prey.</p>

  <p>So in a series of dense patters, the surrounding crickets all ran away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smacked his lips and turned away, ready to continue on his journey.</p>

  <p>But as his gaze swept across the area, he saw a streak of fire approaching him. The fog clouded his vision and he assumed that his fight with the crickets had attracted other beasts.</p>

  <p>But after the glow of fire pierced through the thick fog, Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the mist was a gigantic bull the size of an elephant— it had a pair of red horns and its eyes emitted a faint cyan light. It looked extraordinary and what rode on its back made Luo Zheng let his guard down even more.</p>

  <p>On the massive bull's back was a little boy with a torch in hand.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, the child was like an oasis in the desert.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had planned on merely sticking to one direction until it led him out of the field, he had no idea how long it would take him to make it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps someone could tell him the fastest way to go.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just entered the divine land, completely unfamiliar with the place. He had no idea of the rules and customs of the divine land, so it was a good opportunity to learn from the little boy.</p>

  <p>"Ah! So many dead lacewings! What's going on!?"</p>

  <p>The boy had big, curious black eyes and fair skin— he was rather adorable. Somehow, he didn't notice Luo Zheng standing behind the pile of corpses, which the boy seemed happy to happen upon.</p>

  <p>So apparently, these crickets were called lacewings. The corner of Zheng's mouth curled slightly— he had already obtained the first piece of information.</p>

  <p>Seeing how happy the little boy was, Luo Zheng concluded that killing these insects was beneficial to the boy— they could have either been precious objects or pests of the field, or both.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Luo Zheng took a step forward. "I was the one who killed these lacewings."</p>

  <p>"Ahh…"</p>

  <p>With the surrounding area pitch black and windy, the boy seemed familiar with the field, daring to ride the bull into it alone. But when a stranger suddenly appeared out of nowhere, the torch in his hand began to tremble.</p>

  <p>"You… who are you?" The little boy raised his voice a little, staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cupped his hands meekly and said, "I was just passing by and got lost. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Lost?" The little boy then rolled his eyes, a hint of cunning flashing across them. Although it was only for a split second, Luo Zheng noticed the change. But then the boy laughed. "Even if you got lost, why did you come to my vegetable field? How do you plan on getting out?"</p>

  <p>"I'm heading north, so I think I'll find a way out eventually," Luo Zheng answered truthfully. While on guard, he thought he might find a chance to get out with the boy.</p>

  <p>"You can find a way out by heading north?" The boy laughed even louder. "Heading north? What a joke! Let's see if you can find your way out in a hundred years!"</p>

  <p>The comment secretly shocked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although he had heard that the divine land was extremely vast, he didn't expect it to be so massive that with his speed alone, he needed a hundred years to make it out of a vegetable field.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's expression, the little boy smiled again. "What I said is the truth. You are fortunate to have met me today. Otherwise, you would never be able to leave this place! Get on, let my Ed take you!"</p>

  <p>The boy said, patting the back of the huge bull.</p>

  <p>The enormous bull stood about thirty feet tall with an extremely broad back. A dozen people could have probably fit on there with ease.</p>

  <p>Seeing the boy's sincerity, Luo Zheng thought he might have just been overthinking too much. Without any more hesitation, he took a step forward and jumped onto the bull's back. The boy patted the bull's back and said, "Ed, take me back!"</p>

  <p>The giant bull began moving forward with its head bowed.</p>

  <p>Moving very slowly, the bull was like regular farm cattle plowing the soil. But suddenly, Luo Zheng felt a change in the surrounding space as if it was an illusion. Although the bull seemed to be moving slowly, it was still carrying him forward swiftly.</p>

  <p>"There are so many plants in this field, I wonder what they are," Luo Zheng remarked cautiously. Though the little boy didn't seem to have any tricks hidden away, Luo Zheng figured he had to be careful about everything in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"You don't even know this? Are you from outside?" the little boy returned the question.</p>

  <p>After a moment of hesitation, Luo Zheng answered, "Sort of."</p>

  <p>"All the plants growing here are Jade Immortal Rice— all food for the divine citizens," the little boy explained. "The Jade Immortal Rice is exclusive in our Vast Sky Region! It's a specialty!"</p>

  <p>Divine citizens? Vast Sky Region? Luo Zheng could only repeat the words silently in his mind.</p>
