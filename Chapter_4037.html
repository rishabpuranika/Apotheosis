  <p>
</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The rocks in the cave-dwelling were smooth and solid. The sounds of the stones colliding with each other as they rolled down were especially crisp.</p>

  <p>As they moved along, they saw several round and cuboid stones that were covered with densely-packed runes. Obviously, they weren't any ordinary stones.</p>

  <p>"What are these things?" Thurston asked with furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>Sawyer took a close look and said, "These stones seem to be the earth spirits of the Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>The earth spirits of the Element Spirit race could turn themselves into extremely sturdy stones. They could just be differentiated from ordinary ones because of their unique aura.</p>

  <p>"What? Why would they turn into these?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in confusion as he also inspected the huge pile of stones.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race once trapped the human heroes in this cave-dwelling, so they might have been sent here to guard the place. But still, they were confused as to why they would turn to these inanimate objects.</p>

  <p>"Look! Something is coming out from the walls!" the Snake Goddess quickly warned as she pointed at a wall nearby.</p>

  <p>Then, they saw masses of white orb-like things emerged from within the walls.</p>

  <p>Judging from the form and the aura they emitted, there was no doubt that they were Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"Treacherous Beings!"</p>

  <p>"Watch out for them!"</p>

  <p>"Be alert! Those who could use the Light of Annihilation, be prepared for their sudden attack!"</p>

  <p>After entering the Supreme Pure Realm, they had suffered a lot from the hands of the Treacherous Beings. Thus, they developed an instinctive vigilance whenever they faced them.</p>

  <p>From the aura that they were releasing, it was safe to assume that they were hostility-level ones. But as for what type of Treacherous Beings they were, they still couldn't tell.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>There were a total of three Treacherous Beings that emerged from the walls.</p>

  <p>No one knew what their original form was. When they came out of the walls of the mountain, they were just like flowing water. Then suddenly, they rushed into the pile of stones.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they didn't understand what the Treacherous Beings were trying to do. They began pulling several stones and pillars that gradually turned into three huge stone men.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and his group saw this, that was when they realized the goal of the Treacherous Beings for rushing into the stones that were actually made up of earth spirits.</p>

  <p>"These hostility-level Treacherous Beings are vulnerable in the face of the Light of Annihilation, so the Element Spirit Civilization used the earth spirits to serve as their physical bodies," the Snake Goddess muttered.</p>

  <p>Everyone's face immediately became serious as they faced the combined prowess of the Treacherous Beings and the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>They had already experienced the terrifying power of the Treacherous Beings on the Pure Sky Platform, but they still didn't know much about them. On the other hand, the Element Spirit Civilization seemed to be pretty familiar with how the Treacherous Beings functioned, as they even made fortified bodies specially designed for them.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" King Ieuan asked as it started to panic. "Well, what choice do we have?</p>

  <p>We have to kill them using the Light of Annihilation," the Snake Goddess said with a straight face.</p>

  <p>"But with those bodies, they won't be afraid of the Light of Annihilation now, right?" King Ieuan said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Then we do it in a straightforward manner. We break those stone bodies, drive out the Treacherous Beings inside, and kill them," Zheng declared decisively. "Master Campbell, can you assist me?"</p>

  <p>Campbell nodded at Zheng's request.</p>

  <p>When he left the Pure Sky Platform with them, he had also put on his silver armor and taken his long spear with him.</p>

  <p>As a Treacherous Being himself, he would be pretty useful in battles against them.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, if the Light of Annihilation wasn't used on him, he wouldn't be affected. Thus, he had an incomparable advantage in dealing with the Treacherous Beings that hadn't awakened yet.</p>

  <p>Just as he took a step forward, Campbell's body suddenly froze. "Zheng, it seems like they're well prepared," he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The three stone men seemed to have immediately sensed Campbell's aura.</p>

  <p>A white dot of light appeared on each of the huge round stones on their shoulders. A ray containing the Light of Annihilation was instantly produced and was about to burst out at any time.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! The Element Spirit Civilization has calculated everything!" Fuxi shouted as he gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>As the dominator of the Other Shore, the Element Spirit Civilization had an unfathomable foundation. They were powerful and wise that they almost had no weakness. Now, Fuxi and the others just felt how terrifying they could be as opponents.</p>

  <p>"Get back! Let me handle them!" Pearson stepped forward and took the initiative to attack the stone men first.</p>

  <p>"Keep them busy and I'll find a way to break their bodies," Zheng instructed Pearson as he borrowed the long Spear from Campbell. Since Campbell couldn't risk fighting the stone men, Zheng had to take charge. The surface of the long spear had been specially customized so that the Light of Annihilation could easily spread to the spear's tip.</p>

  <p>As the Light of Annihilation burst out from the Holy Stone in Zheng's palm, the twelve-foot long spear emanated a dazzling silver light.</p>

  <p>Since the Treacherous Beings had an instinctive fear of the Light of Annihilation, they instantly felt the threat oozing out from Zheng's spear.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Then, the runes on the chests of the three stone men began to glow with red lights.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The surface of the stones transformed into thorns, stretching outward. In a flash, the stone men became huge hedgehogs made of stones.</p>

  <p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>

  <p>Discerning that Zheng imposed the greatest threat, they immediately rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>Pearson let out a smile as his body began to vanish bit by bit. His entire body transformed into countless threads that sneakily lay in wait for the movements of the stone men.</p>

  <p>As soon as they rolled toward Zheng, they were instantly tripped by countless silk threads, slowing down their movements.</p>

  <p>As Zheng saw this, his body quickly flashed and appeared above the head of one of the stone men.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being inside the stone man was quick to react. As it saw Zheng above its head, it instantly leaped and tried to impale Zheng's body into the stone thorns all over its body.</p>

  <p>Zheng instantly noticed what it was trying to do. He grabbed on one of the stone thorns and maneuvered his body to dodge its attack.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, watch out! Another one's coming from behind!" King Ieuan yelled.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw that another stone man whose body was covered all over with thorns was rushing over at great speed.</p>

  <p>Although Pearson's silk threads had slowed down their movement, they were still fast enough to not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With Zheng's fast-thinking, he grabbed the long spear and pressed its bottom part against the body of the stone man he was holding, and placed it horizontally.</p>

  <p>Just before the stone man rushing behind made contact with him, he leaped high up. The two stone men collided harshly and the spear pointing towards the second stone man was forcefully stabbed into its body.</p>

  <p>"Aaaargh!"</p>

  <p>Shrilling screams came from the Treacherous Being inside the stone man's body.</p>

  <p>The spear enveloped with the Light of Annihilation pierced cleanly into the body of the hostility-level Treacherous Being. With the power of the Light of Annihilation, it was instantly killed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng rushed toward the body of the dead stone man and quickly pulled out the long spear. Before the other stone man that collided with the dead one could get up, he dashed over to its side.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Before it could even react, the long spear impaled into the other stone man's body. With a hissing sound, the second Treacherous Being was immediately killed.</p>

  <p>After quickly eliminating two of the three stone men, Zheng looked at the other side of the cave-dwelling.</p>

  <p>The third one was blocked and was being taken care of by Sawyer, Thurston, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were waiting patiently to launch their attack. Then, suddenly, Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally drove his golden sword into the sturdy body of the last stone man, leaving an opening on the surface of its body. Fuxi immediately took action and used the opportunity to attack the Treacherous Being inside.</p>

  <p>As he rushed towards the stone man, his palm showed a snow-white light which was actually the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>With the impact of Fuxi's palm enveloped by the Light of Annihilation, the Treacherous Being inside was instantly reduced to a pile of ashes.</p>

  <p>Fuxi waved his hand with a hint of pride in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Previously, during their first encounter with the Treacherous Beings, he thought that they were completely invincible.</p>

  <p>He still clearly remembered the fear they instilled in his heart as they passed the Whining Road for the first time.</p>

  <p>But now that he possessed the Light of Annihilation, he turned his fear into rage and determination and would kill them easily.</p>
