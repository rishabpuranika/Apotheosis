<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 866 A Grave Silence (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Glancing at Maurice, Esther Ling stood up and declared, "Long live our queen. Our lives are her majesty's. Maurice, it's not a harsh task for you to have a second opinion before passing a hasty decision."</p>

  <p>The Demon Night had grown in power over the past few years and had already surpassed the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place. However, this race was not violent or bloodthirsty. So when facing the overbearing ogre race, they had always chosen to tolerate them. As long as the ogre race wasn't doing something out of the way, the Demon Night wouldn't push them too much.</p>

  <p>But today the case was different. The queen Xun's presence changed everything. The Demon Night didn't give in to their woes. Their queen meant everything and Elder Mei had told Malcom that if that meant eliminating Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place at all costs, they would gladly do so.</p>

  <p>Maurice had to act fast as there were so many roadblocks on the way. It was now or never to get rid of Luo Luo Zheng, who by all channels was consistently one step ahead of him. This was the only option he had considering Esther Ling was present with other Demon Night war lords. "Esther Ling, our ogre race will heartily give up five seats in exchange for the life of that lowlife Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Five seats being granted voluntarily in exchange for Luo Luo Zheng was an immense privilege and a walk in the park.</p>

  <p>The ogres had twenty-six seats in the Tower of Sin, while the Demon Night had sixteen. If both parties came to a truce and the offer was to be accepted, then both sides would have an equal number of seats, with each having twenty-one seats.</p>

  <p>Having the gate pass to the Dark Nether Cave was a mouthwatering chance.</p>

  <p>Various races had been contemplating for this chance, and gaining one more seat meant that they had five more qualifications to get in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>The humans had struggled for so many years, yet they only had four seats.</p>

  <p>But now, the ogres just offered five seats to the Demon Night. This was equivalent to slicing a big bunch of meat off the ogre race, which was already a huge concession. And this concession was made only for the exchange of Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod always freaked out and Maurice's offer made them agitated.</p>

  <p>The deal was too good for Demon Night to resist.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would be dead and the human race would be wiped out if the Demon Night accepted the deal. The aftermath would be incredible!</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod got it right.</p>

  <p>Maurice had exactly the hidden agenda to eliminate the human race. Human race being wiped out meant four seats would be entitled to the ogre race despite them losing five seats to the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Esther Ling couldn't help but force a plastic smile on her face. "Which part of my sentence don't you understand and what language can I adopt for your brain to absorb? Maurice, let me elaborate this by a basic illustration.</p>

  <p>If our queen requests that everyone in the Demon Night should end their lives, the over one million members would gladly do so. No one would put a knife on necks but we would do so by our own will and without second thoughts. Get that clear in your head?"</p>

  <p>The entire Demon Night comprised a million members. This was because they had a low reproduction ability. Despite that, they regarded themselves as elites, because they were born nature creatures. This described why their fighting techniques were on par with that of the human race with a hundred million humans, despite the Demon night only having a million members.</p>

  <p>Esther Ling's speech was true and not extravagant.</p>

  <p>Xun had all the authorities. With all the vigor, the Demon Night perceived Xun as a divine emblem. Other than being influential to the creatures of the Lower World, she had authority even in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The faces of Maurice and all the other ogre top-level war lords darkened by Esther Ling's utterances.</p>

  <p>"In brief you mean that you are not ready to comply with my terms?"</p>

  <p>Maurice said firmly.</p>

  <p>"That's right. That's my ultimate verdict." Esther Ling nodded.</p>

  <p>"You resolve to settle this through a war between our ogre race and Demon Night, is that your final remark in this matter?" Maurice repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's our final comment and we will abide by it." Esther Ling stood firm in her decision and nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Hahahahahaha..." Maurice suddenly raised his head and giggled fiercely.</p>

  <p>His raucous roar was so mighty that it resounded throughout the entire tenth floor. "You Demon Night think you have grown powerful enough to challenge our ogre race!"</p>

  <p>Esther Ling frowned.</p>

  <p>Madeline's and Elder Mei's eyebrows furrowed. The way Maurice reacted implied that the ogre race had a secret trump card under their sleeve in the Tower of Sin. Their actions spoke louder.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was more robust than the ogres in the Tower of Sin. If a war broke out between them, the Demon Night would hold the winning title. It was discerned that the Demon Night contained a peculiar expertise with Amber on their side. They would wipe out the ogre war lords present.</p>

  <p>If Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place started a war, their chances of winning the battle against the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place which belonged to the Demon Night were slight.</p>

  <p>In the effect of the battle both sides would suffer great losses.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place could be back at its feet with Amber assisting them. The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place would have a rough time reestablishing themselves. This would contribute to vengeance from the diverse races in indignation.</p>

  <p>What was Maurice clinging on as a backup? Or what were these ogres relying on?</p>

  <p>Maurice suddenly shouted, his tone proving courage. "Patriarch Colin!</p>

  <p>Patriarch Neil! Time has occurred to reveal yourselves!"</p>

  <p>"Thump! Thump! Thump!"</p>

  <p>Two ogres walked down majestically from the eleventh floor.</p>

  <p>An intimidating Mu Ning was produced due to the great thumps of the ogres. It was ten times more powerful than that of Maurice!</p>

  <p>Seeing the two ogres, Esther Ling couldn't help but blurt out, "Colin! Neil!</p>

  <p>Weren't those ogres perceived to be dead? Why..."</p>

  <p>"War sages! War sages appeared in the Tower of Sin!" in the midst, one yelled out. This was like bumping into a dead man alive.</p>

  <p>Seeing those two ogres, Luo Zheng's heart suddenly sank. The ogre race could now celebrate as they had strong ones who had reached the level of war sage, and the Demon Night was still in the darkness concerning this issue. How on earth could war sages step into the Cursed Land and enter the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>Relating to Phoebe's words, this was like a reverie! 'How was this even possible?' Esther Ling thought with her eyes wide open in shock.</p>

  <p>According to the hierarchy, the highest ranking in the Sea God Continent was the Soul Sea Realm masters!</p>

  <p>Below the Soul Sea Realm were war sages, and down further were war lords, war generals and the hierarchy continued.</p>

  <p>There were usually only a few powerful masters in the Soul Sea Realm in each sacred place. The war sages formed the real backbone of the forces.</p>

  <p>Tower of Sin had rules. These measures were put from its existence. The rule was that no Soul Sea Realm masters or war sages could enter the Cursed Land. If any of them dared to go against this rule they would perish.</p>

  <p>The rule was in place ever since the emergence of Tower of Sin and nothing changed. A particular trend cropped up because of the restrictions imposed on the Cursed Land. All the races decided to create transmission arrays and most of them led to the Cursed Land. To those warriors below the level of war sage, these transmission arrays were nothing more than ordinary transmission arrays!</p>
