<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2170 A Tiny Crystal (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The process continued for a long time. Finally, the sword clouds became dimmer and dimmer. Darkness had engulfed each of them. They were actually completely absorbed by the Godly Plate!</p>

  <p>With a flash of his body, Luo Zheng arrived at the top of the Godly Plate. He focused his gaze and saw that there was a hair-like object in the middle of the Godly Plate. It also emitted a brown light, and it seemed to be some sort of crystal. The thin crystal in the Godly Plate radiated a strange essence.</p>

  <p>After he observed the crystal for a while, Luo Zheng composed himself. He then reached out his hand and touched the crystal.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng touched the crystal, it suddenly released an absurd amount of extremely sharp energy. Zheng's guard wasn't fast enough to react to the crystal's energy!</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng's arm was cut off!</p>

  <p>After the attack, Luo Zheng instinctively retreated to avoid the released energy.</p>

  <p>With a light wave of his broken arm, a brand-new arm was instantly formed. Although he was injured by the hair-like crystal, Luo Zheng still revealed a smile on his face. With curious eyes, he stared at the crystal.</p>

  <p>The hair-like crystal should be an essential part in the formation of a Godly Tile. Or rather, the crystal was an extremely small Godly Tile. It was also the embodiment of Zheng's complete comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>It was all thanks to that piece of mud that Luo Zheng was able to form the tiny crystal!</p>

  <p>Although it was very far from a complete Godly Tile, Luo Zheng was happy that he had found the right direction. He finally had a clue on how to form his Godly Tile. That was the most crucial point!</p>

  <p>After a while, the Evil God caught up to him again. The way the Evil God looked at Luo Zheng became extremely different. He was originally an extremely arrogant youth. Even if he was completely suppressed by Luo Zheng, the stubborn emotions in his heart had not dissipated. He believed that he lost to Luo Zheng just because of his own limitations, not because Luo Zheng was really stronger than him.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God had seen Zheng's true comprehension of martial arts. He realized that Zheng's talents were as vast as the ocean, almost unfathomable. With awe in his eyes, the Evil God was completely convinced of Zheng's might.</p>

  <p>"Creator, can we comprehend the sword intent in those sword clouds?" the Evil God asked with a respective tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned at the Evil God. With a calm tone, he said, "Now is not the time."</p>

  <p>He had only crossed the threshold of the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Additionally, Luo Zheng had never seen the Godly Way Tablet of the Emotion Closing Godly Way. With his limited comprehension, he couldn't possibly create a Godly Way Tablet randomly and place it in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The Evil God revealed a look of disappointment. A deep sigh escaped his mouth as his eyebrows creased. At that moment, he no longer wanted to challenge Luo Zheng. Instead, he was immersed in the martial arts. All the martial arts in his eyes were like many difficult problems that waited for him to solve.</p>

  <p>However, there were too few problems in Zheng's inner world. There wasn't much for him to solve. The only one that he had yet to fully comprehend was probably the Ice Soul Flame in the ice field.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he also knew that it wouldn't be long before he could completely comprehend the Ice Soul Flame�</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way contained within the sword clouds was like a peerless beauty that had attracted him. With curious eyes, the Evil God was immediately enchanted. However, he did not have the qualifications to cultivate it, so he was naturally a little depressed.</p>

  <p>"If there comes a day when I have the opportunity, I will make you leave this world to see the real Godly Way Tablets and let you comprehend them yourself," Luo Zheng added. As a being in his inner world, the Evil God was completely under Zheng's control. However, he was still impressed with the Evil God's abilities. With such a talent in his inner world, it would be a waste if he didn't guide him to advance further.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng made such a promise also because he was extremely happy to see the crystal condensed on the Godly Plate. It was a glorious moment for him.</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng's words, the Evil God was immediately overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Happiness was apparent in his expression.</p>

  <p>He would finally be able to leave Zheng's inner world and see those Godly Way Tablets!</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't understand what a Godly Way Tablet was, and he didn't need to know too much. The important thing was that he had the chance to leave Zheng's inner world which was like a cage to him!</p>

  <p>"Creator, I will definitely help you take care of this world," the Evil God said with a serious expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head lightly. The Evil God was indeed very smart. With a committed attitude, the Evil God played the role of a gardener in Zheng's inner world. He helped Luo Zheng carefully manage the inner world so that the many forces in his inner world would no longer fight and the number of life forms in the world would steadily increase.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the avatar of Luo Zheng dissipated from the inner world�</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes as a smile appeared on his face. He was finally able to make some progress. However, his smile didn't last long.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the miraculous mud was indeed helpful in the condensation of his Godly Tile. However, the problem was that he had only stumbled upon it with great luck. He only obtained a piece of it from the Money Alley. If he really wanted to condense his Godly Tile, he would need a considerable amount of such mud. But where could he find more of the mud?</p>
