<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1928 The Situation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Metal clashed against metal, screams drowned more screams. The violent fighting intensified even more as the Evolutionary Universe sunk deeper into chaos.</p>

  <p>Fate seemed to favor the army of the Sacred race, who continued to advance with unstoppable momentum. They made more noise with Roaring Tokens every passing day in the universe, which flooded everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Then again, the war was related to the entire universe, every race, and every living being. It didn't matter whether one was a mortal, a martial artist, a human, or anything else; none of them could stay out of it!</p>

  <p>Before the actual war had broken out, the Demon Night race had been actively preparing for battle.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors from their sacred places had started to gather towards their race's core supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Janice, the lord of the Frigid Autumn World, and her subordinates had been shuttling back and forth through passageways of various supreme worlds. Their supposed destination was the Punishment World, a supreme world where Yao's Heavenly Punishment Palace was located.</p>

  <p>She was the leader of the sacred place's elite warriors. Generally speaking, the warriors with the lowest cultivation level were at the Soul Sea Realm, and the warriors with the highest cultivation level were at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>The enemies they faced this time were too strong, so warriors below the Soul Sea Realm served very little purpose.</p>

  <p>Janice had only been to the Punishment World once, after she became the lord of the Frigid Autumn World. Since the universe was naturally too vast, it hadn't been easy for her to travel an arduous journey of a hundred supreme worlds� even as a world lord herself.</p>

  <p>They had occasionally encountered warriors from other sacred places of the Demon Night race, and most of them seemed worried.</p>

  <p>Provoking words filled everyone's ears from time to time. They didn't know where Maha, the warrior from the Sacred race, had gotten so many Roaring Tokens from, but he clearly annoyed native warriors constantly every day.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Today I killed seven world lords. All of them were from the Humanity Alliance. Their names were... Tsk, tsk! Those guys were so weak. I hope I can meet stronger warriors tomorrow, and I'll kill them one by one." Once again, Maha's voice filled everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"Maha is so mighty!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is!"</p>

  <p>The warriors from the Sacred race began to butter Maha up.</p>

  <p>Janice's face scrunched up in hopeless despair after the many times she had heard those irritating words. "He's too arrogant!" she complained.</p>

  <p>It was true that everyone Maha had killed belonged to the Humanity Alliance. Furthermore, they were human martial artists. Now, Janice and her companions were from a different force, and a different race as well.</p>

  <p>Thus, should she be so angry?</p>

  <p>In reality, however, she wasn't the only one infuriated� the elite warriors from the Demon Night race that she led shared the same sentiments. In fact, all the living creatures in the universe hated Maha with a passion.</p>

  <p>The Humanity Alliance wasn't the Sacred race's only target.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had unashamedly declared from the very beginning that they would treat the entire universe as their own. It had undoubtedly made them the whole universe's public enemies.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when the Humanity Alliance was attacked, the Demon Night warriors naturally got enraged as well.</p>

  <p>Maha's name had spread far and wide ever since the Sacred race had invaded the universe.</p>

  <p>Even though Maha was only a world lord, his strength was far beyond that of a normal world lord. He had a habit of remembering the name of every world lord he had killed, and broadcasting it to the entire universe through the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Of course, the numerous creatures of the universe all gritted their teeth in hatred as they heard his taunts.</p>

  <p>Yet, there was nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>It was even said that Maha relied on his own strength alone to kill the world lords. No other world lord could defeat him in a one-on-one battle, in the entire universe at least.</p>

  <p>The air was filled with a dull silence, until someone spoke. "Master Janice, why won't any Supreme Lord attack Maha?" one of the warriors beside Janice asked.</p>

  <p>The said warrior was quite young, and her name was Lynne. She was considered a divine-level talent among the Demon Night warriors. Her cultivation had been greatly enhanced after she had participated in the Illusion Battlefield, and now she was at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Janice liked her a lot.</p>

  <p>Janice simply stared straight ahead. "Perhaps they have their plans. Since Maha dares to be this arrogant, there's no way that he has no Supreme Lords protecting him. The situation isn't as simple as you think," she finally answered.</p>

  <p>Such a strategy was indeed effective in building up Maha's momentum, which he used to dampen the morale of everyone in the whole universe.</p>

  <p>At the very least, all the lower and middle class martial artists began to complain.</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords had responded ever since the Sacred race had taken over the Wind Avoiding World. They had used the Roaring Tokens to call for all the races in the whole universe to resist the enemies together, but up until now, not a single Supreme Lord had actually taken action.</p>

  <p>As a result, they could only watch helplessly as the Sacred race occupied one supreme world after another, and wrecked slaughter after slaughter.</p>

  <p>In just a few days, Maha had already killed over a hundred world lords.</p>

  <p>But regardless of whether it was the Celestial Position race or the Thoughtless Minds, no one still made a move. Even the Supreme Lords of the Humanity Alliance remained silent.</p>

  <p>It was truly unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Back then, a border dispute between the Humanity Alliance and the ogres caused the death of a mere ogre world lord. It escalated into a fierce battle between the Supreme Lords of both races. Supreme Lord Illusion, a newly minted Supreme Lord that time, had even almost killed an ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>At that time, the powers of the universe didn't think much of the Humanity Alliance because its foundation wasn't as solid as that of the Blessed Buddha Land or the Thoughtless Minds. The Humanity Alliance was just a group of warriors who joined forces together.</p>

  <p>It was because of that same dispute that the Humanity Alliance's status then entered into a new level of power, and made the universe view them in a new light.</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lords of the Humanity Alliance were still silent now. Such an anomaly confused countless martial artists. After all, staying quiet would only weaken the universe's morale even more.</p>

  <p>Finally, one of the world lords of the Humanity Alliance had used a Roaring Token to denounce Supreme Lord Illusion and Supreme Lord of Oracle amidst their own grief and indignation. He even insulted them, which made them look like a joke.</p>

  <p>Still, the two Supreme Lords maintained their silence!</p>

  <p>"If they still don't act, then Maha will be more and more arrogant,"</p>

  <p>Lynne huffed.</p>

  <p>Janice smiled at her and said, "It's hard to guess the thoughts of those powerful figures. I believe they will eventually defeat the Sacred race."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Janice finally led the elites of her sacred place into the Punishment World.</p>

  <p>Elite Demon Night warriors from hundreds of supreme worlds and more than two thousand tenth-grade sacred places were gathered in the Punishment World. There were over six thousand world lords among them, and countless Spirit Transformation Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, and Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>So many mighty warriors of the Demon Night race had gathered in the same place, who all awaited the queens' orders. Almost all of them believed that they would launch a counterattack against the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Within the Heavenly Punishment Palace</p>

  <p>The dome was deceptively peaceful as a blue tassel from the hem of Yao's skirt dropped on the ground. Her long skirt dragged along for over a hundred feet, and above her lovely body sat a delicate face. She looked extremely beautiful and noble under her makeup, but all those cosmetics couldn't conceal her ferocious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Yao stood in the middle of the hall with her eyes closed. The long needle in the depths of her soul was still slowly rotating.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be denied that Xun felt a deep pain and disgust towards this Soul-sealing Needle. She would rather sacrifice herself than succumb under its control.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yao happily accepted the information given by the Soul-sealing Needle. She even felt some sort of coincidence.</p>

  <p>While she was an extremely ambitious woman, she didn't have the strength to back those ambitions. Even if she became one of the queens of the Demon Night race, it would be impossible for her to lead the race to rule over the entire universe. The Demon Night race was somewhat weak compared to the three great powers of the human race, especially on the level of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the moment the Spirit-sealing Needle activated, she suddenly discovered an incredible secret, which made her scream in excitement.</p>

  <p>She felt so euphoric that she had even summoned several toyboys and made love to them for a few days.</p>

  <p>Her original plan was only to stir up trouble. Now she had an excellent opportunity as the Demon Night race was going to join forces with the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>A green light suddenly lit up on the smooth and hard floor in front of her; then an emerald green vine sprouted and quickly grew out of it. In just a few seconds, a giant flower bud appeared.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>The petals of the flower bud suddenly fanned out in bloom, and then Shania, who was dressed in green, stepped out.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other Godly Geniuses, Shania's cultivation had grown the fastest. She had reached the peak of the Spirit Transformation Realm in such a short period of time. It looked like she was about to become a world lord.</p>

  <p>Yao looked at Shania as the corners of her mouth lifted up into a smile.</p>

  <p>"Ying, you're late."</p>

  <p>Shania's cold stare sent daggers towards Yao.</p>

  <p>Shania wasn't that fond of Yao. She had always been immersed in her own research, and had seldom got herself involved in the things of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>It had only been a while since she had recently discovered the mysteriousness of the tenth layer of the Life Law, but the Sacred race suddenly appeared out of nowhere and caused a huge disturbance. It completely disrupted her progress! What was even worse was that the Soul-sealing Needle in her mind released a bunch of information that had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>It was only then that she understood the Demon Night race's mission. It was not something she was happy about, yet she had no choice but to follow the Soul-sealing Needle's intention.</p>

  <p>She was even more depressed when she came to know the reason why she was able to control the tenth layer of the Life Law according to the information in the Soul-sealing Needle.</p>

  <p>There were some loopholes in the Evolutionary Universe because the one who had laid down its rules was almost about to die. She had only happened to find those loopholes, which was why she had accidentally comprehended the tenth layer of the Life Law.</p>

  <p>"They have sent ten Godly Geniuses to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land this time, but not me. In fact, the Celestial Position race has long suspected our Demon Night race, and they don't even trust the ogre race," Shania said. "So don't think that you can catch them off-guard."</p>

  <p>"Of course I know that," Yao proudly laughed. "The first step is to convince our people!"</p>
