<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For such a large amount of divine crystals, it would take a long time to extract all the energies in them.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't a big deal for the Snake Goddess. She already had a plan in mind.</p>

  <p>As the jadeite platform spun, all the divine crystals would be crushed in a certain direction and then release the internal energy.</p>

  <p>The blue energy that gushed out from the divine crystals flowed towards the center like hundreds of small streams. As they gathered in the center of the platform, they formed an azure river of energy.</p>

  <p>The produced river of energy was actually very gentle. Even ordinary people wouldn't get hurt if they came into contact with it. It wouldn't be able to kill a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, when the river of energy rushed over, three Holy Soul Realm Ear Mice quickly took action.</p>

  <p>Three identical Other Shore Tokens appeared above their heads.</p>

  <p>Apparently, these tokens were all from Stage Thirty-three. However, because they were of the auxiliary-type, they were not very suitable for combat use.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the main purpose of the tokens was to compress the river of energy as they interacted with it.</p>

  <p>The river of energy was continuously compressed, and once again turned into crystals.</p>

  <p>The divine crystals were originally ores that contained a great amount of energy, but now, they were transformed into pure energy crystals.</p>

  <p>The energy contained in a piece of the compressed crystal was equivalent to that of seventy million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Snake Goddess also tried to condense all of the divine crystals to such an extent, so that it would be much easier to save and store them in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>However, after being fully compressed, the crystals became very unstable and weren't able to maintain the condensed state for a long time.</p>

  <p>The river of energy continued to roll and surge, and the energy crystals that were condensed floated in front of King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>Above its head was a peculiar-looking Other Shore Token. It was actually a living Other Shore Token, the size of a palm, and looked exactly like a black cat.</p>

  <p>It was known as the Primordial Energy Cat, a magical creature that was found in Stage Thirty-three on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At first glance, it looked like a ferocious black cat, but it was actually an energy entity. Most times, it was in the form of an energy ball. Only when it was hunting would it turn into the form of a black cat.</p>

  <p>The Primordial Energy Cat had a very unique and extraordinary feature. For most Other Shore Tokens and Other Shore creatures, they could only devour and consume a limited amount of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Usually, for Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three, they could easily absorb millions to tens of millions of divine crystals, but that would be their limitation. Any amount higher than that would be difficult for them.</p>

  <p>However, that was where the exceptional feature of the Primordial Energy Cat differed from the others. It could absorb an unlimited amount of divine crystals. The more crystals it absorbed, the stronger it would become.</p>

  <p>When people discovered this insane characteristic, they all pinned their hopes of realizing the Finale Way on it. Even Fuxi had the thought of subduing it before.</p>

  <p>Then, later, they found out that the attack method of the Primordial Energy Cat wasn't even strong. A world existed in its stomach, and the divine crystals that it devoured could only be utilized inside it.</p>

  <p>Most people, including Fuxi, got so disappointed, but the Snake Goddess had an idea in mind and gave it to King Ieuan as a gift. Together with King Ieuan, she had set up the Divine Crystal Array, which should come in handy in a critical situation.</p>

  <p>This time, before the war with the Chaos Ancient Gods, the Snake Goddess had summoned King Ieuan to help control the array.</p>

  <p>"Oakley! Dempsey!" King Ieuan called out in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The two Ear Mice, who were standing beside it, hurriedly took out their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The duo was King Ieuan's capable assistants. They were tasked to trap their opponents in the array for as long as they could.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lamont was still bombarding the golden shield tirelessly.</p>

  <p>As he was busy dealing with the golden shield, he suddenly felt the flowing energy within the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Lamont thought that the flowing energy was used to stabilize the golden shield, so he did not pay much attention to it.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The golden shield shook more and more violently from Lamont's intense strikes.</p>

  <p>The disciples and members of the Li Shan mountain tried to replenish the divine crystals and infuse their energy into the Cloud Cover Array as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>However, their speed wasn't enough to keep up with the rate of how the array consumed the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Every time an attack hit the array, Yan's face turned paler.</p>

  <p>But as the primary controller of the Cloud Cover Array, she couldn't move from her position.</p>

  <p>At such a crucial moment, even if she tried to flee, she would also die.</p>

  <p>"King Ieuan!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>He turned to the jadeite platform with anxiety written all over his face.</p>

  <p>"I hear you. We are ready!" King Ieuan replied. "Dempsey, Oakley, attack!"</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A big crack suddenly appeared on the mountain wall not so far from the jadeite platform. Oakley took out its Other Shore Token. It was a small golden piece called the Heaven Shaking Gold, and it was a one-time type of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>As Oakley threw the gold out, it was quickly set ablaze. At the same time, beams of golden light shrouded the area.</p>

  <p>Amazingly, the golden light was not blinding or dazzling. Instead, it was bright but gentle to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>The moment the golden light bloomed, an irresistible spiritual storm appeared with it. No matter how powerful a person was, they were instantly affected by it.</p>

  <p>When Yan saw the golden light, her mind suddenly went blank and she lost her consciousness.</p>

  <p>Likewise, all the other creatures, who were illuminated by the golden light, experienced the same thing.</p>

  <p>Even Lamont was no exception. Although his soul was far stronger than any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior's, it was unable to resist the surge of the spiritual storm.</p>

  <p>Among all the people present, Luo Zheng was the only exception.</p>

  <p>As the whole area was being illuminated by the golden light, he clearly felt the fluctuation of his bloodline inside his body. Before he could figure out what was happening, he saw Lamont stop his movement in midair.</p>

  <p>During this critical moment, even a few seconds could be fatal for any warrior like Lamont.</p>

  <p>Before they engaged in this battle, King Ieuan and its subordinates had prepared and practiced countless times. The moment Lamont briefly stopped, a stone tablet instantly darted and made a clear hit.</p>

  <p>After the stone tablet attached to Lamont's body, it quickly emitted black ripples. The other stone tablet, which was on Dempsey's hand, reacted and emitted white ripples.</p>

  <p>When Dempsey saw that the black stone tablet had successfully attached itself to Lamont's body, it threw the one it was holding to King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>Then, the Primordial Energy Cat on top of King Ieuan's head leaped and swallowed the white stone tablet in one go.</p>

  <p>"Now!"</p>

  <p>Dempsey didn't waste any time and activated the pair of stone tablets.</p>

  <p>The stone tablets were actually called the Interchange Stone Tablets. Their ability was that they could instantly reverse the positions of the things that they were attached to.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Lamont's body, which was just outside the Li Shan mountain, suddenly disappeared and was brought into the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the white stone tablet, which was swallowed by the Primordial Energy Cat, appeared midair outside the Li Shan mountain, where Lamont's body originally was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was not affected by the Heaven Shaking Gold, was dumbfounded as he witnessed everything that happened. The swapping ability of the stone tablets didn't even produce space fluctuations. This kind of forcible interchange was very domineering.</p>

  <p>After swallowing Lamont whole, the Primordial Energy Cat meowed towards King Ieuan and lay on its shoulder.</p>

  <p>From the lazy expression of the Primordial Energy Cat, it was as if it just swallowed an insignificant rodent. In the world in its stomach, a whole bunch of terrifying energy was raging.</p>
