  <p>
</p>

  <p>Evidently, the one who stood on the far end of the line had no idea about what was going on.</p>

  <p>Naturally, when everyone turned to look at him, he became cautious.</p>

  <p>Suddenly baffled by the unwanted attention, he began to eye himself up. As he glanced sideways, his gaze fell on the black tail, which caused him to stiffen up.</p>

  <p>Although he had no clue what it was, there was a high probability it came from under the wooden bridge. If so, then it must have been a creature from the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>Even though he tried his best to remain calm, the situation at hand required a lot of wits to do so. His Soul of Light couldn't help but have a strong fluctuation out of fear.</p>

  <p>"Help! Someone, please help me!" he shouted but in a low voice for a few people near him to hear.</p>

  <p>When the other disciples close to him noticed the tail, they were too scared to approach him and help.</p>

  <p>Now that they didn't want to alarm the creature, they had to walk on the wooden bridge with careful steps.</p>

  <p>When he realized his calls were all for naught and no one would come to his aid, the disciple paced anxiously to get as further away from the tail as possible.</p>

  <p>But just as he moved, the tail with a hook shot up in the sky. It began to spiral in the air before it aimed itself towards the disciple.</p>

  <p>"All of you get down now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted on top of his lungs. Then, he dashed towards the tail while jumping over the heads of the disciples.</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light were powerful. However, they were not strong enough to fight against the monsters that resided on the Other Shore. What was more frightening was the fact that this creature was from the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>No one but Luo Zheng could handle a situation such as this.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's words rang in the ears of the disciple, he instinctively ducked in time for the tail to miss its target.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had only managed to pass over Feng Ge's head. He was still far away from the reach of that disciple. The tail, on the other hand, was much more flexible in its movements than anyone could have imagined.</p>

  <p>Although it missed, the tail did not seem to retreat. Instead, it went around the bridge. The disciple who had been lying on the bridge had no space left to go. He was surrounded. The teammates of the disciple watched in horror as the creature from the Dark Region pierced his Soul of Light and moved out of the bridge.</p>

  <p>In an attempt to rescue him, Luo Zheng jumped up in the air and reached his hand out to grab ahold of the disciple.</p>

  <p>But the tail seemed to have eyes of its own and had seen Luo Zheng approach it swiftly. Suddenly, it swept right to lead Luo Zheng in the wrong direction and bypassed him. With quick movements, the creature shrank into the darkness under the bridge with the disciple still in its grasp.</p>

  <p>Desperate shouts of help were heard from the disciple when his Soul of Light was first pierced. His voice was loud in this quiet space and could be heard far and wide. But the moment he disappeared into the darkness, it was as if it had swallowed him as his cries for help left with him. Only the trembling sound of the wooden bridge could be heard as everyone fell into a deep silence. Luo Zheng had almost broken the rotten wooden bridge from his jump.</p>

  <p>"It must be a monster of the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>"Jabir has been dragged down. I think it killed him!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that thing?"</p>

  <p>The disciples snapped out of their confusion and began to panic all at once.</p>

  <p>"The problem is that monster is right below us," Chaim said with a frown while pointing his finger downwards.</p>

  <p>The light on the bridge was unable to light up the underneath. Moreover, they knew nothing about the Dark Region, which was why they had no idea how to deal with the monster.</p>

  <p>"Hutton, do you know what it is?" Luo Zheng asked, looking rather serious.</p>

  <p>After all, among them, the Nine Li members were the only ones who knew this place.</p>

  <p>Hutton shook his head and replied, "Sorry, I don't know much about the Dark Region. I only have some clues about going through the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race had never expected to encounter such a crisis.</p>

  <p>"There is a possibility that the monster won't come for us, right? Maybe it feels full after devouring one Soul of Light," Sally said, suddenly sounding anxious as she ran her gaze in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Sally!" Hutton's face visibly darkened as he yelled at her, "This is not the time to utter such nonsense."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng walked up to Hutton and calmed him down by placing his hand over his shoulder. He spoke in a solemn voice, "There is no need to get all worked up. What Sally said might be true. I know we are not able to figure out the monster's purpose as yet. But, it is possible that its target is to eat up your Souls of Light."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't include himself in the possibility now that he was a physical body. But he did not know the limits of power this creature contained, so he was unsure whether this monster was able to swallow his physical body or not.</p>

  <p>"It would be in our favor if it was full after snacking on one Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>However, I have a strong hunch it won't leave us alone just yet..." Chaim said with low spirits as he hung his head.</p>

  <p>Hearing his painfully honest words, everyone felt a cold chill run down their spines. Out of fear, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace prepared for the reappearance of the tail. They all began to release their spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Having no other choice, they began to advance forward. With fearful steps, they set out for their destination once more.</p>

  <p>However, this time, their formation differed from that of before. Chaim and the members of the Nine Li race led the group forward while Luo Zheng remained in the middle of the troops. With this strategy, Luo Zheng could be able to guard them against all attacks, whether from ahead or behind.</p>

  <p>As they walked along the wooden bridge, they had covered a long distance without encountering the monster. Their hearts heaved a sigh of relief as they felt like they were out of danger. Maybe, Sally was right. The monster might be full after swallowing one Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone relaxed their tensed bodies, they heard many noises from behind!</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The noises sounded as if there were hundreds of monsters running under the wooden bridge!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Hutton, and the others froze in place. Their faces turned white as a sheet out of fear, and their Souls of Light trembled unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>After every passing second, the noises drew closer and closer. It would only be a matter of seconds before the monsters reached their feet. The constant running of the creatures caused the wooden bridge to shake continuously.</p>

  <p>It was hard enough for them to fight against a single monster from the Dark Region, let alone dozens or hundreds of them. The group had already lost all their morale and let down their guards in defeat. However, Luo Zheng remained calm. He clenched his fists and began to concoct a countermeasure in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The voice under the bridge was only a few inches away from the group. The monsters were running with frantic movements at a notably fast pace. But they crossed them at the same speed they approached them with.</p>

  <p>As he sensed their footsteps fade away in the distance, traces of fear disappeared from Chaim's face as he said, "It seems we are not their target..."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. It isn't us, but I think they are running from something far more dangerous. We should get a move on, and we must be fast," Luo Zheng said as he pointed towards the behind.</p>

  <p>Not too far behind them, a thick red python was covering most of the wooden bridge. It twisted and turned its body to move forward. Sometimes, it would move towards the darkness to camouflage itself, and occasionally it would show up on the bridge. In front of the python were a few monsters.</p>

  <p>From their appearance, they seemed to be half-human and half-monkey. As the python slithered its way towards them, they galloped wildly to get away from it.</p>

  <p>Their tails were exactly the same as the one that pulled the disciple into the darkness. It was apparent that they were the monsters that hid under the bridge.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Of course, these human-monkey monsters' movements were remarkably agile, but it was still hard for them to escape the clutches of the python.</p>

  <p>Every time the red python looked up and clenched its teeth towards them, a human-monkey monster would be swallowed whole into its stomach.</p>

  <p>After gobbling up several human-monkey monsters, the red python raised its head to scout its next prey. Its huge tongue slithered out of its mouth when it discovered Luo Zheng and the others. "Hiss..."</p>

  <p>Without wasting a moment, the red python went around the wooden bridge and crawled forward at an incredibly fast speed.</p>

  <p>"Hurry, let's go now!"</p>

  <p>At this point, they could all agree on one thing: to run and escape as further away as possible from this creature.</p>

  <p>However, the power of the Souls of Light had their limitations. In terms of speed, they couldn't compare with a physical body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt anxiety build up in his body as he noticed the Souls of Light would struggle to keep up with him. At this rate, the red python would catch up to them in seconds and devour them one by one.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, he suddenly thought of a plan and shouted towards them, "Quick! All of you grab onto each other! I will drag all of you with me as I run!"</p>
