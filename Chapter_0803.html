<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 803 A Pasture </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the voices of the two children faded away, the surroundings once again became silent. Luo Luo Zheng didn't even have the strength to observe his surroundings, let alone try to find out where he was.</p>

  <p>Good thing was that he didn't have to be too nervous about losing the space ring. There was his mark on it which made it impossible for normal people to open it. His treasures were safe.</p>

  <p>'Those two kids seemed like the children of commoners. I don't think there are powerful warriors in their families, which means even their families won't be able to open the space ring, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Right now, his biggest problem was to recover his strength and bring back movement into his muscles. At the very least, he had to be able to move his body.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the sky gradually darkened and the surroundings became dim as they immersed themselves in the darkness.</p>

  <p>After an unknown amount of time, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly heard more footsteps coming his way, as well as the sound of some people talking.</p>

  <p>"Is he here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dad!"</p>

  <p>"Quick. Go take a look, but be careful."</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng saw a yellow light appear at the edge of the crater. Several burning torches and a few middle-aged men were peeking curiously at him from the edge of the crater.</p>

  <p>'They are not warriors, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>One of them stuck his head out and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely blinked, unable to utter a word.</p>

  <p>"Bring him up first," another man ordered.</p>

  <p>Immediately, two middle-aged men climbed down from the edge of the crater curiously. One of them tied a rope around Luo Zheng's body and threw the other end of the rope over the edge of the crater as he shouted, "Pull!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not move an inch.</p>

  <p>"Why is he so heavy?" someone remarked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was tall, he wasn't a strong-built man. According to their estimates, he should have only weighed slightly more than a hundred pounds. There were four adults tugging at the rope, but they failed to move him even one bit.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Luo Zheng's body had been refined several times and was now a fairy weapon, so the densities of his body and bones were far greater than those of an ordinary person.</p>

  <p>In fact, during the process of cultivation, the density of warriors' bodies and bones increased constantly. Otherwise, their bodies wouldn't be able to withstand the strength of millions of pounds. What was more, Luo Zheng's body was much heavier than that of an ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>Those people eventually figured out a way to move Luo Luo Zheng. They whispered among each other and after a while, Luo Luo Zheng heard someone's whip suddenly whip the air. PAK! He then heard the sound of a horse's hoof. The force tugging the rope finally pulled Luo Luo Zheng out of the crater.</p>

  <p>The surroundings were pitch black now, but the darkness wasn't a hindrance to Luo Zheng's vision. After being washed by the sap of the divine tree, his eyes could easily overcome the obstruction of darkness.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to move freely and could only allow himself to be placed on a cart. Once he was safely placed on the cart, he heard the sounds of four horses pulling him as they slowly moved forward.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng saw a tent out of the corner of his eye. It was built along a huge plain and clearly, the settlement was not a small tribe.</p>

  <p>He felt slightly comforted. It seemed that this was the gathering place of a group of nomads.</p>

  <p>"Friend, you should rest here," a middle-aged man lowered his head and told him. "This ring was taken from you by my son and should be returned to you." With that, he waved the space ring in front of Luo Luo Zheng and placed it on his hand. Then he pulled the little boy before Luo Luo Zheng and pinched his hand. "As for my child's theft, I've already taught him a lesson. You! Apologize to this uncle," he ordered the boy.</p>

  <p>"Sorry..." The little boy seemed to have been crying for a long time, since his voice was a little hoarse.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng saw that there were also bloodstains on the boy's hands. Actually, he wanted to say that there was no need for them to do this.</p>

  <p>But it was a pity that he had no way of making a sound. It was a little troublesome.</p>

  <p>When those people left the tent, Luo Luo Zheng was left alone in the bed.</p>

  <p>Throughout the entire night, he silently circulated his life vitality, trying to recover his strength.</p>

  <p>In order to resist the purple space windstorm, he had exhausted all of his life vitality. Now, all he could do was slowly absorb energy from nature.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his belly was still able to circulate energy. As his life vitality condensed, it was initially like a clump of purple fog that was slowly rotating inside his belly. Then, it began to circulate along the meridians in his body.</p>

  <p>After he had been sucked into the purple space windstorm, a large amount of Space Law Power had penetrated his body and had been trapped within his meridians.</p>

  <p>If he were an ordinary warrior, he would have been paralyzed.</p>

  <p>However, his physique was special. Although his meridians were completely blocked by the Space Law Power, the interior of his body was not damaged. He only needed to remove the Space Law Power from his body, and then he could move.</p>

  <p>However, it was not an easy task to remove the Space Law Power. Luo Luo Zheng was going to have to expend some of his power to do so.</p>

  <p>After a night of rest, he was able to remove all of the Space Law Power from his spine. Although his body was still immobile, he could at least move his neck and speak.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning, the tent was opened. It was the little girl who was holding a pancake and a bag of water.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to feed the pancake to him, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked with a smile, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him with her watery eyes, completely stunned for a moment, and then shouted, "Dad, this freak can speak now!"</p>

  <p>"Freak?" Luo Luo Zheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>The moment she finished speaking, the tent was opened up once again by a number of middle-aged men who had saved him yesterday.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you're awake?" the middle aged man in the lead asked him.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on the man's face. He asked in bewilderment, "This is the ogre's pasture. You don't know?"</p>

  <p>"Ogre's pasture?" A look of suspicion appeared on Luo Zheng's face. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The man revealed a helpless smile. "A pasture is a pasture. What other meaning could there be?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was even more puzzled.</p>

  <p>If this was the ogre's pasture, why were there human herdsmen?</p>

  <p>Although the ogres were much civilized than the demons and the ogres even had their own writings and cultural heritage, they were still a completely different and violent race. How could they live in peace with the humans?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, judging by what Immortal Mist had said, this continent was a chaotic world, and it was even more impossible for such a thing to happen.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly heard someone shout from outside,</p>

  <p>"They are here! The ogres are here. Guys, get out of the tents!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man nodded at Luo Luo Zheng and told him, "I'll be taking my leave first. The ogres have come to the pasture to pick people. According to the rules, we all need to go out."</p>

  <p>The cover of the tent was still open, and Luo Luo Zheng turned his head to the side to see that not far from him, there was a group of seven to eight hundred people standing neatly together on a field. There were both old and young, and women and children in the group.</p>

  <p>In front of these people, there were two tall ogres. They were all grayish-brown in color and were around 10 feet tall. Two long fangs protruded from their mouths. Clearly, they must be the ogres that the announcer had spoken of.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen ogres before, during the Blooded Test. The last level five unreal beast Luo Luo Zheng had killed was an ogre too.</p>

  <p>The two ogres moved around the crowd of people, and then one of them said arrogantly, "Today is the Governor's birthday. A banquet is going to be held. We need five people!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man looked troubled. "My Lord! Aren't five people a little bit too much?"</p>

  <p>"No bargaining! We need young people this time. You! You! You and you...</p>

  <p>Hmm, that little girl is not bad. She looks fresh and delicious. Bring her along as well!" The ogre pointed at the little girl.</p>

  <p>When the middle-aged man heard this, his expression became even more troubled. "Sir, she doesn't qualify! The Governor said that he didn't want little girls under fourteen!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you care so much? And whatever! Today, the Governor is very happy for his birthday, and he wants to eat something tender. Haw-haw!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he threw out a rope towards them.</p>

  <p>The little girl wanted to escape, but there was no way she could escape the ogre's rope. She was instantly trapped.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes at this sight. A trace of killing intent appeared in his eyes. He finally understood that this was indeed the ogre's pasture. Humans were not the herdsmen, but the animals. Ogres cultivated and ate humans!</p>
