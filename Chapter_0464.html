<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 464 Sword Washing Pool (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The higher one could insert his sword in the mountain, the greater his benefit would be. It wasn't easy though.</p>

  <p>Anyone who came here would obviously try his best and insert the sword at the top of the Killing Sword Mountain. This would ensure maximum benefit, but only if it was so easy! One needed to go through several challenges to defeat the sword intent hidden in those swords. There was only one path to the top of the mountain, and the sword intents were on that path. Luo Luo Zheng had to defeat them.</p>

  <p>However, he clearly knew that he couldn't win over the sword spirit of next sword, as it was too powerful, so his only option was to throw the sword to the mountaintop.</p>

  <p>This was a mystical area and no one knew whether Luo Luo Zheng was the first person to do so since the Killing Sword Mountain had been made.</p>

  <p>However, if he had succeeded, his sword would have landed higher in the mountain.</p>

  <p>Deciding that throwing was his only option, he chose it. Luo Luo Zheng was born with superhuman strengths. When he threw his sword, he also activated all the power in the dragon's scales.</p>

  <p>The Streamer Sword, under his power and the dragon's too, drew a bright silver arc of light in the air as it hurled in a parabolic path, almost like a meteor streaking over countless sacred weapons. It soared upwards and far!</p>

  <p>With the extreme initial velocity, it took the sword three breaths of time to lose its upward power and begin falling towards the earth. Then it slammed into the middle of the mountain ridge, where the top grade sacred weapons were stuck. As a lower grade fairy weapon, the Streamer Sword was clearly visible among them, like a lion in a zebra herd.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the cyan dragon paused for a moment, too astonished to speak. The Killing Sword Mountain was a special sacred place and it had its own rules, which everyone had to follow. Breaking them would mean immediate expulsion. Powerful as the cyan dragon was, he dared not to help Luo Luo Zheng from the beginning to the end lest he broke the rules and was punished. And Luo Zheng's sword throw made him worry that the idea might violate the rules of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>If the Killing Sword Mountain did not acknowledge Luo Zheng's sword inserted in such a manner, the sword would bounce back. He was even more afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would be expelled directly from the Killing Sword Mountain for this reason.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's sword was safely inserted into the mountain ridge. Then it emitted soft splendor, which demonstrated that it was establishing a connection with Luo Luo Zheng. Obviously, Luo Zheng's sword had been recognized by the Killing Sword Mountain. He did not need to reach there himself. Only his sword did.</p>

  <p>"Did that really work? I totally did not see that coming!"</p>

  <p>Whatever had just happened went way over the cyan dragon's head. He had lived for hundreds of thousands of years and was much older than Luo Luo Zheng, but he suddenly found that Luo Luo Zheng had refreshed some of his ideas.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Luo Luo Zheng had just wanted to try the idea and see whether reaching higher in such a manner was acceptable or not. He hadn't expected it to actually work!</p>

  <p>It was a pity that he was not strong enough. If he had been stronger and with enough brawn, maybe he could have thrown his sword right to the top of the mountain, where it could stay among the divine weapons or perhaps, some even higher ranks of the weapons.</p>

  <p>Of course he knew that he couldn't be too greedy. The Streamer Sword had landed in a fairly good spot which far exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>After the Streamer Sword lodged itself into the ridges of the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt some changes taking place in his body. There was a very special feeling in his mind, as if he was beginning to get connected with this huge sword mountain! As if he could talk to it. An invisible passage seemed to have been formed between his body and the Killing Sword Mountain which could let him reach higher places.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, before Luo Luo Zheng could carefully understand and analyze that feeling, the Killing Sword Mountain collapsed out of the blue in front of his eyes. With the loss of the whole world of the Killing Sword Mountain, his consciousness retreated from it immediately and he found himself back in the arena.</p>

  <p>When his consciousness returned, the cyan dragon smiled and told him,</p>

  <p>"I'm so impressed. It really surprised me when you were able to throw and lodge the sword so high. This way of killing is a good way to be strong, so make good use of it. Now, I've done enough, and I feel like taking a nap. Bye!"</p>

  <p>Even though the cyan dragon had devoured a piece of dragon bone spear earlier on, he hadn't received much energy from that. After all, the dragon bone spear was too small for a gigantic genuine dragon.</p>

  <p>As the cyan dragon gradually fell asleep, Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes and woke up.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is awake! He's awake! Finally! Now some action!"</p>

  <p>"It took him so long to learn the consummate sword intent."</p>

  <p>"Hey wait! Tianming hasn't woken up yet. It's taking him longer!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at Tianming who was sitting close by. His eyes were still shut and he didn't seem to have retreated from whatever place he had gone to yet.</p>

  <p>According to the cyan dragon, in the moment of understanding the consummate sword intent, Tianming would have been sent to another place in order to be tested and granted new skills.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was only one of the several hundred sacred cultivation places in the world. He couldn't know where Tianming had been taken and why he hadn't woken up yet.</p>

  <p>However, just at that moment, Tianming opened his eyes suddenly.</p>

  <p>As his eyelids flickered and his pupils came into focus, there was a sudden outbreak of fierce sword intent from his body. It formed a huge cyclone into the sky, and several flashes of terrible lightning and thunder loomed into the air, traveling across the cyclone.</p>

  <p>"Is there a kind of thunder power in Tianming's sword intent?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly, a little surprised. The blue lightning Tianming was emitting seemed quite powerful. Combined with Tianming's sword intent, the lightning was emitting a faint trace of natural law.</p>

  <p>"It looks so powerful, almost like true lightning in the sky! Alas, I envy Tianming having such a great opportunity. He had an enormous breakthrough and all he did was sitting there for two hours. How do I find myself opportunities like that?"</p>

  <p>"Don't even think about it. You wouldn't be able catch up with him even if he hadn't mastered the consummate sword intent! Now he is even more powerful."</p>

  <p>"Would you look at that? Luo Luo Zheng has also grasped the consummate sword intent, but he seems to have gained less power. When he woke up, he didn't burst out such an eye-catching effect."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he heard the audiences' remarks.</p>
