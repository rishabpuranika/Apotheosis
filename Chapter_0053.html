<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>By the time they reacted, quite a few ordinary disciples had slipped through the gate and entered the third level of Bloody Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Stop them!" cried one of the noble clansmen who was dressed in blue.</p>

  <p>Seeing the scene, the other noble clansmen knew they wouldn't have anyone to rob if more commoners slipped by.</p>

  <p>It was worth pointing out that while these noble disciples were not strong, with the weapons and magic tools their families provided, they could still fight.</p>

  <p>They clustered together quickly to fill the breach and restore their checkpoint.</p>

  <p>While this was happening, the disciples who were trailing after the towering man continued attacking. The cruel and unrelenting enemies left them only the choice of brave resistance or dropping out of the game. Anyone at this time could burst with increased strength.</p>

  <p>So the scuffle escalated.</p>

  <p>"Aaahh......!" wailed a disciple as three noble disciples attacked, leaving him gutted. His enemy stood over him with a bloody long sword that shimmered a brilliant green light.</p>

  <p>Although each disciple was in the magic array, protecting them from real death, the pain was still real.</p>

  <p>After screaming, the disciple was immediately encircled in a light, and he was gone.</p>

  <p>But the noble disciples were not faring well. During the fighting, a noble disciple gently pushed against a commoner to stop him. The ordinary disciple appeared unimpressive but was, in fact, more powerful.</p>

  <p>The noble clansman felt a strange stab force its way into his body. He began to twitch, tremble, and fell to the ground, dead. Countless dots encased him in light instantly, and he vanished, too.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved with a deft prowess, like lightning during a storm. Many disciples from noble clans tried stopping him, he dodged the attacks easily, weaving between them as he advanced.</p>

  <p>He managed to shake off the interception, and passed the chaotic checkpoint, nearing safety. The outcome of the battle didn't concern him.</p>

  <p>He needed the time to accumulate more crystal fragments.</p>

  <p>As he scanned the scene he had managed to escape, he caught sight of Nory in the crowd.</p>

  <p>Nory was only at the bone refining level. The best choice for him was to stay and kill phantom beasts on the first level. But, he appeared to be caught up in the middle of the scuffle, so, he must have wanted to rush to the third layer too. That was beyond Zheng's expectation.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Nory's strength was relatively weak among the people, and he didn't draw much attention. He was struggling forward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a noble disciple noticed Nory and crept up behind him silently holding a gory dagger. Raising it as he neared Nory, he was about to have that dagger driven into his back.</p>

  <p>If Nory were stabbed, he would be disqualified.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment, Zheng didn't stop to think; instead, he quickened his pace, sped, and seized Nory, pulling him to the side.</p>

  <p>Because of Zheng's actions, the noble disciple's sneak attack failed.</p>

  <p>Nory was oblivious to what happened. When he got his wits, he realized a knife fell to the ground, just behind where he had been standing.</p>

  <p>He had a look of alarm when he realized what almost happened. He gratefully said, "Zheng, I ......" he stopped short. Zheng had no time to talk because the noble disciple was so angry he immediately picked up his dagger and launched himself at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blade was coming straight at Zheng's neck at a deceptive angle, one that was difficult to escape. He wanted to kill Zheng with a single blow.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Purple Fist Strength!" yelled Zheng as he punched the noble clansman, striking his chest hard, knocking him and his dagger backward to the ground. In the wake of Zheng's attack, he felt seven slight explosions in his body, and seven substantial bloody holes appeared on his chest. When Zheng enhanced his strength, the Purple Fist Strength had improved too. With terrifying destructive power, his attacks dealt fatal physical damage to an enemy's body.</p>

  <p>Another light appeared, floating around the noble disciple's body. Zheng eliminated a child from a noble clan with a single punch.</p>

  <p>The melee was finally winding down.</p>

  <p>The disciples that were strong enough had raced past and onto the third layer, while the ones who didn't have time to rush or weren't strong enough were eliminated.</p>

  <p>Of course, many disciples from noble clans were eliminated during the battle as well. The noble disciples' number went from more than twenty to only a dozen left standing. Half of their people failed the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>Knowing so many had failed depressed the noble disciples that remained.</p>

  <p>Their predecessors used this method to pass the test, and had said robbing crystal fragments in this pass was the easiest way to get into the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Many of them had succeeded in the previous years.</p>

  <p>So, most of them thought they would pass, even if they lay down to nap during the Blooded Test. They never expected a single person to rush the barrier, or that so many others would get involved. They lost control of the situation immediately and unexpectedly lost more than ten people at once.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng eliminated a noble disciple.</p>

  <p>The noble disciples were depressed, and they found no way to vent. Seeing what Zheng did, they promptly gathered together to launch an attack on him.</p>

  <p>"Go!" one shouted. Watching the noble clansmen surround him, Zheng shoved Nory to a safe distance.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>"It's so discouraging that my cousin was eliminated!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't believe these common men would resist! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>The noble clan disciples were so furious that they lost their reasoning. They raced at Zheng, attacking him madly.</p>

  <p>Half of them were at the organ refining level, and half were at marrow refining level. Every one of them wielded a powerful weapon. Each weapon was above the grade of medium mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained unflustered in the face of the insanity rushing toward him. He knew if he panicked, there would be more trouble than he had now.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed to slits, and he observed the disciple in blue, secretly selecting him as a target.</p>

  <p>As soon as the noble disciples began to rush him, Zheng ducked in the opposite direction, bypassing the bodies in front and headed past them at the man in blue.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed they were all following the lead of the man in blue. Taking on the leader first, to defeat his bandit followers, had proved to be the proper strategic choice. So, Zheng got him first.</p>
