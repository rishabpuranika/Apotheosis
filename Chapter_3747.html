</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's knowledge served him right, the Ways-blending Energy also had great potential.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the Heavenly Obsession Civilization only focused on the Energy Shaft. It did not mention the Ways-blending Energy at all.</p>

  <p>"The Ways-blending Energy?" the green figure asked with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Our Calculation Civilization is best at blending Divine Dao. We even blended three thousand and one Divine Dao back then during the era of Calculation Civilization. But so what? That one missing Godly Way was never found!" the green figure exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The method the Calculation Civilization used to blend Divine Dao was naturally different from what the Evil God used.</p>

  <p>The Evil God used his impressive talent to blend Divine Dao, while the Calculation Civilization still relied on calculation to do so.</p>

  <p>It was possible to permute and combine the three thousand and one Divine Dao in countless ways.</p>

  <p>As long as there was enough time and with a powerful calculation ability, one could find the best blending method sooner or later.</p>

  <p>In terms of the sequence and operation method, the Calculation Civilization had summarized a total of six ways to blend Divine Dao. "You have blended three thousand and one Divine Dao?" Luo Zheng asked as the corners of his eye twitched.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was very likely that the Evil God had obtained the "arc light energy" in his hand from the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, but what about the Blood Essence Godly Way of the Regal Jade Civilization?</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the Element Spirit Civilization had hidden the last Godly Way," the green figure answered. "We got this information from a Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>Maybe the Ways-blending Energy was the best method to complete the Finale Way, but we couldn't resist against the Element Spirit Civilization. It was impossible."</p>

  <p>After it was done speaking, the Regal Jade Spirit slowly said, "I didn't expect that someone else had gone further even before our Regal Jade Civilization?"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had always believed that only the Wing King had obtained the blood red Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>He had never imagined that someone else had already acquired the Sanskrit word and deciphered the information inside it even before the Wing King could.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the green figure's statements matched exactly with the information Luo Zheng knew, so the green figure certainly did not talk nonsense.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng also told the green figure how he had obtained the Blood Essence Godly Way and the "arc light energy". Then he asked, "Is it truly impossible to get the last Godly Way from the Element Spirit race?"</p>

  <p>"That Godly Way should be hidden in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Our Calculation Civilization can't do anything about it, unfortunately," the green figure said with a shake of its head.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we can do something," Luo Zheng said with a gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" the green figure burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>It clearly didn't think that Luo Zheng could make it. "At what phase is the current round of chaos?" it asked again.</p>

  <p>"It's almost at the end," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Luo Zheng wasn't sure about the duration of the entire chaos, but he always heard that the chaos had reached the last phase ever since he had entered the Source World.</p>

  <p>"What a pity..." the green figure muttered. "With our calculation, we have already deduced and confirmed the best method to make a complete Energy Shaft," said the green figure.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>If they could get hold of a complete Energy Shaft, then that would probably be the best way to complete the Finale Way. However, there seemed to be an issue since the green figure said "what a pity".</p>

  <p>Thus, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, "If your civilization could already make an Energy Shaft, then why was it a pity?" "It takes a long time to cultivate the embryo of an Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>Since the current chaos is in the last phase, there isn't enough time," the green figure explained.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven frowned at this answer.</p>

  <p>He knew about the plan of the Element Spirit race. If the Purge Way succeeded, then the end of the chaos would be delayed, and there would probably be no chances anymore.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng suddenly thought of something. "What if there is a ready-made Energy Shaft?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ready-made?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the green figure looked at each other in confusion.</p>

  <p>Last time when the Snake Goddess and Fuxi visited the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they only discussed some important things.</p>

  <p>They hadn't told the Primeval Lord of Heaven that the embryo of the Energy Shaft was already placed inside Yan's body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and proceeded to describe the "Energy Shaft" he had seen before. "My sister Yan only got that Energy Shaft not long ago, and according to Fuxi, that was just an embryo," he added.</p>

  <p>In turn, the green figure's whole body fluctuated as if it was excited. It said,</p>

  <p>"We Calculation Civilization never believed in fate, but it seems that fate has guided you to come here.</p>

  <p>The embryo of the Energy Shaft should have existed for a long time, otherwise, it couldn't merge with your sister."</p>

  <p>It was true that the Energy Shaft of Li Shan mountain was constructed a long time ago.</p>

  <p>However, there had never been a suitable object to merge with it.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Snake Goddess proposed to create a perfect self to merge with the Energy Shaft. That was why she used the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed to create Yan.</p>

  <p>"Can she have a complete Energy Shaft?" Luo Zheng asked. "Of course!" the green figure answered.</p>

  <p>"Although we've been frozen here for a while, we have always waited for an opportunity.</p>

  <p>For us, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance," it said.</p>

  <p>The two girls, Phoenix and Li Bianxue, were both stunned when they heard the whole conversation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already exhibited too much unknown power back in the battle between the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Jin Wu. However, it wasn't until now that they realized their knowledge of Luo Zheng was only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

  <p>"Then what should I do now?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Take out the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," the green figure replied.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng brought out the square, box-like Civilization Artifact from his inner world once again.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The edge of the Civilization Artifact began to glow with green light.</p>

  <p>Then, rays of green light also flashed around the place.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the green figure disappeared from the wall and in the next moment, reappeared on the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it said, "It is impossible to destroy the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, but because it was frozen, you cannot carry it. But, it can still help you since the core is now activated and connected to the Civilization Artifact."</p>

  <p>"What can it help me do?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Calculate," the green figure replied simply.</p>

  <p>Calculation was the foundation of the Calculation Civilization.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was still confused, the Primeval Lord of Heaven gently reminded him, "With the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, you can decipher Sanskrit words that you don't understand? and even the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>"I see!"</p>

  <p>Back then, he had to ask Luo Nian for help for him to read the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Thus, it would be very convenient if the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization could directly decipher the Sanskrit words. "Can we see the creatures in the Cold Prisons then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the green figure confirmed.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng put away the Civilization Artifact, then he and the two girls carried the Divine Fire Shield out of the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>When they came across a Cold Prison, the Civilization Artifact released a ray of green light, which illuminated the white spots in the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the big core began to glow brightly. It meant that it had started to calculate at an insane speed.</p>
