  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race and other Sacred Supreme Lords were all shocked and upset. Displeased expressions were revealed in their faces.</p>

  <p>The dozen or so Sacred Supreme Lords stood there still like blocks of wood. All of their minds were in chaos.</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race, Master Feng, stood formidably on the Evolution Lotus Flower. The Evolution Lotus Flower continued to spin around and floated towards the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race. The eyes of the head of the Celestial Position race flickered as he looked at the Grand Supreme Lord. He then asked with an arrogant tone,</p>

  <p>"Are you guys going to kill yourselves here, or are you trying to struggle in vain?"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord lifted his head and looked at the head of the Celestial Position race with a complicated expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Despair seemed to have enveloped him. Meanwhile, the spinulose wood fern behind him was already dark and without light. As the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race, his best course of action was to let everyone escape back to the Murphy Universe. However, would they be able to survive such a miserable situation?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a strange sound rang out.</p>

  <p>The mysterious sound echoed throughout the area.</p>

  <p>"Pop, pop, pop..."</p>

  <p>The sound was like that made by a woodpecker when it continuously knocked against a hollow tree.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the noise came from all directions. Everyone present could hear it clearly. However, they could not find the source of the sound!</p>

  <p>"Pop, pop, pop..."</p>

  <p>The sound continued to reverberate...</p>

  <p>Soon, both Zheng and Xun raised their heads and looked up at the same time.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords present at the area also looked up. Their eyes continued to search for the source of the noise...</p>

  <p>The mysterious sound actually came from high above the sky of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The height of the Evolutionary Universe was limited. It would undoubtedly have a boundary up in the sky.</p>

  <p>High above in the sky, the stars moved slow. A dark void lingered above the stars. At the very top of this void was the dome of the Evolutionary Universe. The dome was formed by the Sighing Wall to seal the Evolutionary Universe off from the outside world.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the universe was the deepest part of the Lower World, while the dome was the highest part of the universe. The universe was so vast that the distance between the two points was 180 billion trillion miles.</p>

  <p>The mysterious voice came from such a far distance away...</p>

  <p>Not only the Supreme Lords but almost all of the creatures within the Evolutionary Universe heard the sound. Most of them focused their sights on the heavens.</p>

  <p>Countless mortals in one hundred thousand supreme worlds all raised their heads to stare at the sky. Frightened expressions decorated their faces as cold sweat trickled down their backs.</p>

  <p>Although the sound had no particular message, it still shook the entire universe!</p>

  <p>They were just like the crew of a large vessel, and anxiety would envelop anyone who suddenly heard strange noises from the ship they were at.</p>

  <p>"Pop, pop, pop..."</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that sound? Who's making that noise?"</p>

  <p>"Is someone playing a prank with a Roaring Token?"</p>

  <p>"We often hear the sound spreading from the Roaring Token. We're quite familiar with how it enters our minds. But this sound is completely different from the one that comes from a Roaring Token."</p>

  <p>The Roaring Token forced the voice into the ears of every living being through the Law of Causality. Even if one were to cover their ears, they would not be able to resist the sound from a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, the voice was transmitted from the dome of the universe...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle, Master Feng, Zheng, and the rest also looked at each other in dismay. Bewilderment was apparent in their expressions as they were utterly clueless about what had just happened.</p>

  <p>Every creature was confused about the mysterious sound.</p>

  <p>The divine land was in an uproar at that time.</p>

  <p>"Murphy! What the hell are you doing? Are you courting death?"</p>

  <p>"Stop, Murphy. You can't break the rules. The power of the stone slab is unimaginable!"</p>

  <p>"Is Murphy insane?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. He's asking for it. Everyone, just ignore him!"</p>

  <p>The voices of Holy Beings could be heard one after another. Different opinions reverberated throughout their discussion.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings mocked Murphy, some were surprised, some dissuaded him, and some tried their hardest to persuade him. All of their opinions were heard by Murphy.</p>

  <p>However, Murphy was not affected by them at all!</p>

  <p>Not long after, a crack appeared in the dome of the Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>A long zigzag line suddenly appeared with a dark premonition on the dome.</p>

  <p>The Sighing Wall, which was over a thousand miles thick and extremely sturdy, actually cracked! No one had thought that such a thing would be possible.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The sound of the Sighing Wall breaking spread throughout the Evolutionary Universe. It was like the noise made by the keel of a massive ship when it was torn apart. Panic and confusion caused everyone's heart to palpitate.</p>

  <p>As the sound continued, the crack on the dome relentlessly grew bigger for millions of miles.</p>

  <p>The bright light of the Sighing Wall reflected off the crack. Countless mortals in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds discovered that a strange star appeared in the sky. The mysterious star was far larger than any ordinary star. Similar to a giant spider that lay with dangerous intentions, the star settled suspiciously in the sky...</p>

  <p>Bang! A thunderous noise was heard by everyone.</p>

  <p>As the entire Evolutionary Universe began to shake, a voice came out from the crack in the dome of the Evolutionary Universe. Everything shook as the voice reverberated through the Evolutionary Universe. The voice was solemn as if it could command all living things and control everyone's life and death!</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are, just go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a beam of soft light flashed from the crack in the dome.</p>
