<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Life Vitality Strike wasn't a cultivation method from the divine land, or to be more specific, it wasn't a cultivation method used by some True God.</p>

  <p>A system of cultivating chaotic energy wasn't something that existed in the divine land. There weren't any chaotic-energy cultivation methods suitable for True Gods? in theory.</p>

  <p>However, the creation of the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike proved this theory somewhat wrong. As a supreme chaotic weapon, this dark, iron sword birthed the token of utilizing chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>It also had a very bad temper.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had lured Lone into a trap last time in the Illusion Battlefield. This was already equivalent to messing with the sword itself.</p>

  <p>It had to use its token to deal with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He is using chaotic energy!"</p>

  <p>There was a split-second pause on Luo Zheng's part. He was momentarily stunned by this sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>His chaotic sea was becoming more viscous by the minute, and the World Tree was gradually emerging from within.</p>

  <p>He had felt it for quite a while? that faint feeling of being on the cusp of a breakthrough. If he ascended to the Spirit Supreme Realm, then his chaotic sea would solidify.</p>

  <p>Chaos originally existed as an Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng already knew about this when he first read his master's book and saw him roaming about in the chaos.</p>

  <p>He had been gradually liquefying and solidifying chaos as he cultivated.</p>

  <p>He wondered how his inner world would be in the future.</p>

  <p>There was only one problem now, though.</p>

  <p>He really couldn't figure out why Lone had control over the chaos as well.</p>

  <p>'Didn't Master tell me that nobody had managed to successfully cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique?</p>

  <p>Even Master himself failed to practice the technique. How could Lone use chaotic energy?' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>'I must retreat!'</p>

  <p>It was a split-second decision, born out of the unsureness of the situation.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Life Vitality Strike was amazing.</p>

  <p>Lone didn't transform his chaotic energy into life vitality, but directly fused it with the Metal Law.</p>

  <p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>

  <p>Golden and grey rays of light started shooting towards Luo Luo Zheng as he attempted to flee.</p>

  <p>The golden light wasn't a big problem since Luo Zheng's divine weapon body could resist and deflect it. The grey light, however, was an entirely different story.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The grey light seemed to have the ability to pierce through anything. At that moment, both rays of light reached Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The golden light failed to break through his defenses.</p>

  <p>The grey light, on the other hand, easily pierced through him? quite literally. There was a bloody hole of melted flesh from where Luo Luo Zheng had gotten hit by the grey light ray.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The only thing that chaotic energy gave Luo Luo Zheng was a powerful boost.</p>

  <p>Before, his use of chaotic energy was limited to allowing the chaotic energy to devour things and convert itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would often convert the chaotic energy into Law Power before using it to protect his secret. Nobody around him knew that his inner world comprised of a chaotic sea, especially since chaos was a deadly poison to all living beings in this universe.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew and nobody could even start to comprehend the possibility of his secret.</p>

  <p>Lone's sword strike had served as a reminder to him.</p>

  <p>Why did he unnecessarily transform the chaotic energy into life vitality?</p>

  <p>Why not just directly trigger the power of chaos?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's comprehension of the Metal Law reached its fifth layer, namely the Metal Protection. He had the ability to utilize the Metal Power in order to protect himself.</p>

  <p>However, he barely found any need to use it since his divine weapon body was better.</p>

  <p>"Run away, ha-ha! Let's see if there's a place you can actually hide in.</p>

  <p>Weren't you so confident back in the Hall of Causality?"</p>

  <p>Lone jeered, following Luo Luo Zheng as he swung his sword around. He looked like a ridiculously overpowered hedgehog from far away, with the numerous rays of golden and grey light that surrounded his entire body.</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board was large, around one million feet in both width and length, but its area was still limited.</p>

  <p>It didn't even take more than three seconds for these Godly Geniuses to pass the entire board.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would inevitably be forced into a corner. That much was obvious.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong his body was, it would still yield to the powerful grey light rays.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is about to be defeated," Nathan murmured. In his head, he was trying to figure out a way to beat Lone's grey light rays.</p>

  <p>Lucille pouted, "What a pity!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is defeated by a single move. This is so boring!" Lawson commented.</p>

  <p>He spoke the truth though. The moment this battle began, Lone had already utilized the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike to attack. Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to have the power to fight back at all. It was boring since there was no excitement in guessing who would win and the victor was already obvious from the very start.</p>

  <p>"Like I said, Luo Luo Zheng is strong but he's nothing compared to a real Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>"Even if he loses, he'll still get a Godly Plate. What if he gets lucky again one day? Who knows? Perhaps there might be some Godly Tile in that Immortal Mansion of his. He might just become a True God one day."</p>

  <p>"He's got a really good stroke of luck. I'm quite envious of him."</p>

  <p>As a warrior from the Lower World who was able to make it this far, Luo Luo Zheng was truly lucky in the eyes of so many people.</p>

  <p>In the onlookers' eyes, none of the ace talents of those large forces was inferior to Luo Luo Zheng. However, those talents had long since been eliminated.</p>

  <p>They were now mere audience to this battle.</p>

  <p>From how they saw it, it was Luo Zheng's honor to lose to Lone.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stood on top of her stone while Ning Yudie stood gracefully in the Pure Jade Sacred Place, both watching Luo Luo Zheng with rapt attention.</p>

  <p>He couldn't be beaten so easily. He just couldn't. They refused to believe it!</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes flashed. "You won't lose before we exchange blows!"</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Despite executing the Eight Smoky Melodies and dodging all those rays of light, Luo Luo Zheng still got hit every so often.</p>

  <p>The sharp grey light rays were vicious and left hole after hole of melted flesh in Luo Zheng's body where blood gushed forth like a spring.</p>

  <p>"Give up! You should be glad we aren't outside or you would die for real." Lone had grown crazy with mirth as he watched Luo Luo Zheng get hit by his attacks time and again. His thoughts had gotten frazzled ever since he and the sword fused into one.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood his circumstances and quickly calculated his next move.</p>

  <p>He withdrew from the "sun" and flew past the "star" before finally arriving at the edge of the Heaven Earth Board. As he moved, he left behind a morbid line of dark, red blood from his wounds.</p>

  <p>At that moment, there was really nowhere else he could run to.</p>

  <p>Lone strode towards him, sword raised up high as he prepared to deal the killing blow.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already a dead man to him. There was no way his prey would be able to escape him now.</p>

  <p>Even the True Gods feared chaos, let alone Luo Luo Zheng. At that moment, Lone felt incredibly powerful, as if he was a butcher killing a chicken with an extremely sharp knife.</p>

  <p>This sword was sentient and had intelligence. It normally would not deal with Lone's opponents since the young man had to hone his own skills to be able to win against his rivals. However, this battle was a special case.</p>

  <p>The sword needed to wash away its shame of being played by Luo Luo Zheng. It had a personal vendetta against the young warrior and it was determined to kill him in the most violent way possible.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Lone screamed, ready to unleash the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was already riddled with holes, and everyone was already counting on his death.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, he raised his spear and pointed it at Lone. A smile then appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The smile made Lone hesitate. Why would someone in such a compromised position smile?</p>

  <p>This young man most probably had some tricks up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>But what exactly were these tricks?</p>

  <p>The sword had already witnessed everything. There was no way it could be hoodwinked by someone like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was no way this battle was turning around. Lone himself didn't think that there was any secret cultivation method that could go up against the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike.</p>

  <p>It was only a few moments later that Lone would understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>A golden ray of light burst forth from the tip of Luo Zheng's spear.</p>

  <p>Lone immediately knew what it was. It was the fifth layer of Metal Law, condensed by life vitality. He wanted to laugh. There was no way this would be enough. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to resist the Chaotic Life Vitality Strike, then he would at least need to comprehend up to the Metal Law's eighth layer.</p>

  <p>However, after that flash of golden light came a burst of grey.</p>

  <p>Lone's eyes widened in shock as he witnessed the sight!</p>
