<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Of course not." The little girl cut his confusion short with a curt reply.</p>

  <p>She stared at Elder Xue with eyes filled with mockery as if to look down on him. "The World of Nothingness contains all kinds of things. Even an insignificant needle wouldn't be able to escape it. If it really were to appear, you'd instantly become a part of it, and if that happened, you wouldn't even be able to stand here."</p>

  <p>"Is this World of Nothingness a creation of the Fostering race?" Elder Xue asked again.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't." The little girl shook her head. "It was created by Clarence."</p>

  <p>"And who is this Clarence that you speak of?" Elder Xue continued to ask one question, followed by the other, to dissolve his confusion.</p>

  <p>The girl tilted her head and placed her finger on her chin as if she was lost in thought. "He owns everything, and he has created everything." After giving a brief, yet vague explanation, she continued while pointing her finger upwards, "To advance further, you just need to climb up."</p>

  <p>"That's not so hard. We'll be fine." Geoffrey shrugged as if to refuse all her help.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the World of Nothingness really did have an eerie vibe to it, but what could it possibly do?</p>

  <p>At most, it could only manage to affect something so little as his mood, right? That was not so bad. Without giving the ball a second glance, Geoffrey continued to climb up, ignorant of his surroundings and the situation he was putting himself in because of his arrogance.</p>

  <p>Seeing Geoffrey's indifferent behavior, the little girl just smiled and shook her head in disapproval in silence.</p>

  <p>After they walked two circles around the Levitation Tower, they reached the height of two hundred and thirty feet. There, the ball disappeared out of sight, along with the lingering desolate feeling brewing inside of them.</p>

  <p>However, just as they took the next step forward, a huge wall appeared before them in the center of the tower. The wall was crafted with several intricate patterns, consisting of squares and circles of various sizes all interlinked with each other, along with different sets of lines that formed unusual things.</p>

  <p>"What you see before you is the Wall World, the second-grade world," the little girl explained from behind in her usual monotonous voice.</p>

  <p>To Geoffrey and Elder Xue, the Wall World was nothing more than a picture. However, it felt relieving compared to the World of Nothingness they experienced earlier. They could even sense faint signs of vitality emanating from the lines that formed vivid pictures of living creatures etched on the Wall World.</p>

  <p>"This is not a test at all. It's just a brief visit," Geoffrey scoffed as he gave his shoulders a slight shrug.</p>

  <p>The little girl seemed frustrated from Geoffrey's continued arrogant demeanor. Unable to withstand it any longer, she snapped at him, "The World of Nothingness and the Wall World are at lower levels compared to your world, which is why you remain unaffected. When you are confronted with the higher-grade worlds up there, I'll see if you can still speak as arrogantly as you do now."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue was taken aback by the little girl's strong statement. He began to piece everything together and finally figured out the reason why the Fostering race bestowed them with their current soul power.</p>

  <p>Next, they would have to go through the baptism of the higher-grade worlds. The higher the grade of the worlds, the more information they contained, and the higher the requirements for the souls.</p>

  <p>'Could I withstand the sixth-grade world with my current soul power?</p>

  <p>What about the seventh-grade world? And the eighth-grade world...'</p>

  <p>While Elder Xue pondered over his limitations, his eyes fell on Geoffrey, who remained beside him.</p>

  <p>As a creature from the third-grade world, Geoffrey was surprisingly able to move freely in the fourth-grade and the fifth-grade worlds. Perhaps he could be able to reach those higher worlds with ease compared to Elder Xue himself.</p>

  <p>Even though Elder Xue harbored these concerns in his head, he didn't voice them out to Geoffrey. Instead, he continued to climb up alongside Geoffrey without uttering a word.</p>

  <p>After another climb of twenty feet, they came across the third-grade world. This was the world Geoffrey was most familiar with.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had been away from the chaos for a steady period. Suddenly coming face to face with his world made him stop in his tracks as he stared blankly at it. Upon seeing things he was once familiar with, he couldn't help but feel homesick. But then, he lowered his gaze to shake the feeling off.</p>

  <p>Then came the fourth-grade world. This time, it was Elder Xue who started to experience deep feelings of nostalgia with one short glimpse of it. After all, he had spent a fair amount of time in the fifth-grade world and never got the chance to return to the main world.</p>

  <p>When they continued their climb and reached a height of three hundred feet, they were faced with the fifth-grade world. This world did not pose any difficulty for them as they had no feelings attached to it like the previous ones.</p>

  <p>"This is the fifth-grade world, known as the Stellar World. Those are the members of our now perished Fostering race," the little girl introduced.</p>

  <p>Just as Geoffrey laid his eyes on the creatures of the Fostering race, he broke out in a fit of laughter. "Seriously? Those are the members of your Fostering race? They look so funny!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue had never seen the members of the Fostering race before. He didn't expect them to look so naive and cute to the eyes. However, his reaction wasn't as offensive as the one Geoffrey portrayed. He nudged Geoffrey with his elbow and shook his head to gesture him to stop laughing.</p>
