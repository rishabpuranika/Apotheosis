  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Demon Sealing Array was broken, everyone began to panic.</p>

  <p>This was especially true for the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The forest wasn't too far away from where the race lived. Since childhood, every member of the race knew about the existence of a gigantic monster in these woods, one they couldn't afford to offend.</p>

  <p>Adults had used this monster to scare children when they made mistakes.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Collapsing Mountain race was well aware of just how powerful a Martial Sacred Beast was.</p>

  <p>Panicking, Chapman immediately shouted, "Everyone, calm down!</p>

  <p>Dragon Hunt Squad, remain in formation!"</p>

  <p>The Dragon Hunt Squad was only second in strength to the Divinity Hunt Squad. They were the backbone of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>On Chapman's orders, most of them were able to keep the Demon Sealing Array intact, but the gap on the left remained.</p>

  <p>Someone from the Divinity Hunt Squad wanted to make a move, but Chapman stopped him.</p>

  <p>When the steel rope entered the Demon Sealing Array in pursuit of Han Liusu, Chapman had already realized that the Martial Sacred Beast was after this girl.</p>

  <p>This monster was too powerful, even for the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, only the steel rope was entering the Demon Sealing Array. If the Divinity Hunt Squad took action, it might infuriate the Martial Sacred Beast even further. If that happened, the entire Collapsing Mountain race would be in danger of being destroyed. Rash decisions would cost lives.</p>

  <p>Technically, it wasn't the Collapsing Mountain race's duty to protect warriors outside their race. Moreover, Han Liusu didn't even possess the qualifications to enter the hunt squads! She wasn't their responsibility.</p>

  <p>Everybody watched the ingenious way through which Han Liusu moved.</p>

  <p>Her graceful body continuously twisted and turned, making her look like a spinning flower and dazzling everyone. In the blink of an eye, she had elegantly landed in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Save me," she softly said with an innocent blink.</p>

  <p>As soon as she had voiced out her request, she promptly hid behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This whole time, her face had looked calm. But when he felt her shiver behind him, Luo Luo Zheng realized that she had been afraid after all. Now that she had found some protection, she was free to acknowledge how terrified she actually was.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled wryly. Was Han Liusu this certain that he would be able to save her?</p>

  <p>"You! Get out of the way!" Chapman barked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the most valuable person in this mission. If Han Liusu had to die, then let her. The Collapsing Mountain race wouldn't allow her to take Luo Luo Zheng down with her. Even though Chapman knew that Han Liusu and Luo Luo Zheng had known each other long before they entered the Collapsing Mountain race, he would never allow such a thing to happen.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Chapman lunged, as if he was ready to pick up Han Liusu and toss her out of the Demon Sealing Array.</p>

  <p>Kennan and his companions wouldn't allow Chapman to proceed.</p>

  <p>Kennan stood in front of him and said, "The Princess Royal is the daughter of the Holy Emperor. If she dies, it will enrage the emperor.</p>

  <p>When that happens, even the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land will have to pay the price!"</p>

  <p>"Scram!"</p>

  <p>Chapman's fiery temper began to show. They weren't in the divine land.</p>

  <p>He shouldn't have to deal with these fellows from there.</p>

  <p>Because Kennan and the others had blocked Chapman, the steel rope had reached Luo Luo Zheng. With a sudden twist, it swept behind him and toward Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, don't act recklessly!" Chapman warned him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. He reached out for the steel rope and swiftly wrapped it around his own arm.</p>

  <p>The moment he touched the rope, he suddenly understood why the foreign warriors had almost no chance of winning against the Martial Sacred Beast.</p>

  <p>The power contained in that single steel rope was beyond his wildest imagination!</p>

  <p>"Give me strength!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng began collecting the strength that he needed, the Eight Path Platforms began to flicker. At the same time, the power within the Nine Divine Stars also began to drain away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was exerting as much strength as he could. The steel rope which had been twisting nonstop now abruptly charged upward, launching Luo Luo Zheng up with it. Thinking quickly, Luo Luo Zheng let go of the steel rope. He was hurled into the sky, past the thick branches of numerous trees, and landed thousands of feet away.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, who had been hiding behind Luo Luo Zheng, was stunned. She stared frozen at the steel rope, still so close to her, as the fear on her face intensified. She had never thought that she would die in this place.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With another sudden twist, the steel rope went back for Han Liusu and wrapped itself around her waist.</p>

  <p>When they saw that Han Liusu was about to be dragged away, a few members of Divinity Hunt Squad of the Collapsing Mountain race breathed a sigh of relief. This woman had stirred up trouble for the race.</p>

  <p>Now that the Martial Sacred Beast was taking her away, peace was sure to return to the land.</p>

  <p>However, Kennan and the others with him felt differently. Their eyes looked like they were about to pop out from their sockets.</p>

  <p>"Wishing Spell,"</p>

  <p>Kennan announced all of a sudden. His group had always been genuinely loyal. Those who could accompany the Princess Royal to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were all devoted members of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The Wishing Spell only granted a warrior one wish. After the warrior had made a wish, he had to fulfill it. Kennan hadn't fulfilled his last Wishing Spell yet, and so it was impossible for him to make another.</p>

  <p>However, there was one other way around this rule. He could pay for the wish using his life, or even his opportunity of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>To Kennan, this was the greatest sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Before Kennan could even cast the grand Wishing Spell, a human figure suddenly descended with a crash from the trees above.</p>

  <p>Clearly, a single human had come down, but everyone felt a powerful yet invisible wave of energy blast in every direction. It felt as though countless mountains had come together in the sky and then later plummeted to the ground.</p>

  <p>When the dust had settled, everyone saw who the figure was. It was Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Unknown to everyone, Luo Luo Zheng had already summoned the power of the Nine Divine Stars when the steel rope tossed him upward. Now, he concentrated all that power under his feet, where it formed an incredibly sharp blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had learned this move from Lucille's Crescent Blade.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that this time, raw and condensed power replaced the Crescent Blade.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng stepped on the steel rope, it snapped in two.</p>

  <p>In truth, the force had torn the steel rope apart before Luo Zheng's foot even touched it.</p>

  <p>The steel rope that had wrapped around Han Liusu became loose all of a sudden. In a second, it slipped off of her body. The part that had been cut off began twisting and thrashing, quickly withdrawing from the Demon Sealing Array.</p>

  <p>Warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race, along with the outsiders present, had long moved away from the action in fear of getting hurt.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked to the clearing in the middle, with Han Liusu following right behind him. No one dared to go near them.</p>

  <p>"This time... I'm afraid things are about to get worse," said one of the men in Divinity Hunt Squad of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The moment it fell quiet again, steel ropes appeared from every direction, all like tentacles targeting Luo Luo Zheng. Each tentacle pierced through the Demon Sealing Array and rushed toward Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had angered the Martial Sacred Beast!</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter. Whenever the steel ropes wiggled, they made a noise.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Chapman of the Divinity Hunt Squad, stood where they were, not daring to move.</p>

  <p>None of them could win against a Martial Sacred Beast. Luckily for everyone else, this beast seemed intent on going after Luo Luo Zheng. The steel ropes passed over everyone's heads and rushed toward Luo Luo Zheng in the middle.</p>

  <p>No one had gone against the Martial Sacred Beast for ages, and now, Luo Luo Zheng had even injured it, cut off one of its limbs.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath as he watched the steel ropes roll in from everywhere. They were getting closer and closer! He pulled Han Liusu toward him. "Come closer!"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu nodded and moved closer, pressing her hands on Luo Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>Right then and there, the Nine Divine Stars inside Luo Zheng's inner world began to shine with unprecedented brightness. When the people within Luo Zheng's inner world witnessed this phenomenon, they all knelt and touched the ground with their foreheads. They saw this as a direct command from the Venerable Creator. A baby born on this day would have the Venerable Creator's full protection for the rest of its life.</p>

  <p>Only a third of the power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what would happen to him if he used that amount of power in one go.</p>

  <p>Once his strength reached a certain point, it would be difficult for him to estimate how much he should use, but he figured that the more he used, the better.</p>

  <p>At the moment, and with the short time that he had, using a third of the Nine Divine Stars' strength was his limit.</p>

  <p>Shortly, the invisible force spread out and formed a small sphere about ten feet in diameter around Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu. No one saw it, but everyone felt it. Once the sphere had stabilized, everything within it, aside from Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu, was obliterated. Dead leaves, branches, dirt, and scavengers on the ground did not turn into dust but merely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Rumble, rumble.</p>

  <p>Unleashing this amount of power made the ground shake. It rumbled for a brief moment, temporarily deafening everyone. No one was aware that they had heard a loud sound. They only felt as though the entire world had fallen absolutely silent.</p>

  <p>Confused, everyone looked at Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu, and the invisible sphere made known only by the crater it had made on the ground.</p>

  <p>As for the steel ropes, the moment they touched the invisible sphere of power that Luo Luo Zheng had made, not a single one broke. Instead, they all simply disappeared.</p>
