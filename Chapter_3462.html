  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Evil God's body is getting smaller!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has sealed his limbs! He's unable to take them back!"</p>

  <p>"Keep this up and the Evil God is bound to lose!"</p>

  <p>There was a faint smile even on Mount's face. He was finally witnessing the defeat of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's method was not ingenious, but was direct and effective.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God figured it out, too.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes flashed with a somber black light. As he once again charged toward Luo Zheng, his direction suddenly changed. He now bore down in a vertical downward arc, aiming straight for his severed limbs!</p>

  <p>By smashing those damn Green Jade Crystals, he would be able to turn his limbs into energy that would evaporate into the surroundings and integrate into his own body.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had already expected this move when he had sealed the limbs. He wasn't about to let the Evil God have his way.</p>

  <p>Scratch! Scratch! Scratch!</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Crystals rapidly rose from the ground like long and narrow tubes. The Evil God's severed limbs and other body parts floated within them. In the blink of an eye, all the crystals and their contents were sent to the edge of the Green Jade World, scattered equidistantly in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's face darkened as he lunged for the arm closest to him.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Crystal that contained it flew rapidly, but the Evil God was faster.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Crystal shattered in the Evil God's clutches. As his severed arm broke out, it turned into wisps of black energy and evaporated in the air. The Evil God's body increased a little in size after.</p>

  <p>But as this happened, Luo Zheng appeared near him at an odd angle. Luo Zheng waved his hands covered with crystals, and tore off the Evil God's legs again!</p>

  <p>As the legs were severed, two Green Jade Crystals lunged like serpents, grabbing the limbs, and speeding away.</p>

  <p>"You!" Rage crossed the Evil God's face, but it showed a faint hint of fear.</p>

  <p>"Let's see how small you can get," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Evil God glared at Luo Zheng and went straight after another severed limb.</p>

  <p>In terms of bodily movement skill, the Evil God was no match to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng had full control of where the limbs went. He would never let the Evil God get them back.</p>

  <p>Whenever the Evil God approached a limb with his powerful explosive force, Luo Zheng would always be there first, or just at his heels.</p>

  <p>The Evil God got nothing back. Instead, more parts of his body were just cut off by Luo Zheng. At some point, even if he fought back, it would have been easier for Luo Zheng to deal with him.</p>

  <p>The power the Evil God was endowed with by the Inheritance of World was slowly reduced by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In no time, the Evil God's body shrank from four feet to three feet, then two feet. In the end, the Evil God was only as small as a baby.</p>

  <p>"The Inheritance of World should be your last resort," Luo Zheng said as he flapped his wings, flying toward the Evil God not far away. "Destroying your soul would show your real body, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>Once a warrior unleashed the Inheritance of World, their whole bodies would be turned into energy, scattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was like that, and so was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were two ways to kill the masters who unleashed the Inheritance of World: exhausting their energy to force their real bodies to appear, or directly destroying the whole world they summoned.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for Luo Zheng to destroy the Evil God's strangely-colored world, but he had a way to exhaust the energy of this world. No matter how powerful the world was, it was still an Other Shore Token. The energy contained in it was limited!</p>

  <p>This was why Luo Zheng had sealed some of the Evil God's energy in the Green Jade Crystals when he cut off the Evil God's body parts.</p>

  <p>Dismantled little by little, the Evil God floated in the air, glaring up at Luo Zheng, his eyes twitching.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he truly felt Luo Zheng was mighty again.</p>

  <p>He remembered the first time he challenged Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had laughed at his careful plans, his calculating schemes, his ambitions, even his wife's expectations for him.</p>

  <p>That experience of helplessness still stung him.</p>

  <p>After he encountered the Black Ship, he gradually understood the truth of this world and understood Luo Zheng's real strength. He devoured Souls of Light, explored, and cultivated on the Other Shore like mad, until Shera told him that no one under the Chaotic Source Realm could defeat him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God knew himself better. He had merged with a civilization. Even the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm couldn't defeat him, let alone those of weaker strength!</p>

  <p>When he came into contact with the so-called talents of various races on the Other Shore, he had felt they were nothing compared to him!</p>

  <p>Except for Mount, nobody had ever posed a threat to him. But in the end, he still couldn't defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Was this the strength of Luo Zheng, his creator?</p>

  <p>Spotting Luo Zheng flap his wings intending to pull apart more pieces of him, the Evil God gave a relieved smile. His diminished body finally broke down completely, and the remaining black energy dissipated in all directions.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the voice of the Evil God echoed in the strangely-colored world.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you really impressed me. But do you think you can defeat me like this? You are too naive! Since you have forced my hand, I have no choice but to show you eternal annihilation!"</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The strangely-colored world began to shake, shattering a great number of the Green Jade Crystals overlapping it. The destructive aura spread around the whole world, like doomsday had come.</p>

  <p>All this time, the various races had been focused on fighting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, ignoring the fight between Luo Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>However, the violent shaking finally caught everyone's attention. Their expressions changed in an instant.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Countless black snakes crawled out from the rippled dark clouds in the sky.</p>

  <p>They coiled and lunged down, turning into huge meteorites falling down!</p>

  <p>Feeling the power of the meteorites, Luo Zheng slit his eyes. "How is that possible? I have consumed most of his energy. But the power of the meteorites is... So incredible!"</p>

  <p>It was impossible to estimate the meteorites' strength. Luo Zheng felt fear shoot instinctively through him.</p>

  <p>What was more horrifying was that there were more than one huge four-legged black snake! More snakes appeared, turning into black meteorites.</p>

  <p>Once these meteorites struck, they were bound to destroy everything in the strangely-colored world.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" The Evil God's laughter rang out across the strangely-colored world. "I like seeing you fear, Luo Zheng."</p>
