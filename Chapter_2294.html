<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not even a second later, Luo Zheng looked down and gently tapped the side of a snowy mountain peak with the tip of his finger.</p>

  <p>The snow on the peak disappeared in the blink of an eye, revealing the dark cyan rock wall hidden beneath.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand, and the peak, which was already well over ten thousand feet high, began to float in the air. Under Zheng's control, the enormous peak crackled in movement. For a moment, dust billowed all around and stones flew into the air...</p>

  <p>As he watched this scene, the Evil God also secretly felt quite shocked.</p>

  <p>With the Evil God's power, destroying an entire mountain with a height of ten thousand feet was a breeze. On the other hand, grabbing a mountain of this size and remolding it at will like what the Creator had done was impossible for him to achieve.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the huge peak turned into enormous stones, each a hundred feet in size. At that very moment, Luo Zheng closed his eyes, and an invisible force spread out from his body. He was an omnipotent existence in this world, and thus, nothing could stop him.</p>

  <p>As the invisible force swept over, the surfaces of all the giant stones turned into fine powder that blew away in the wind.</p>

  <p>When all the powder was gone, the giant stones turned into giant statues of Zheng's image that floated in the air.</p>

  <p>"I will distribute these one hundred statues to every corner of this world, and you will complete the rest." Once Luo Zheng had finished speaking, his figure once again weirdly disappeared into the air, along with the one hundred statues that had covered both the sky and the sun.</p>

  <p>Moments later, Luo Zheng appeared in the Emerald Pine City, which was over a thousand miles away from the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng floated strangely in the air, he didn't trigger any of the city's restrictions. He did however, attract the attention of many people.</p>

  <p>Several warriors looked at him and speculated about his identity.</p>

  <p>As the onlookers watched him, Luo Zheng waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge statue landed in the open space of the Emerald Pine City. The entire city trembled as Luo Zheng disappeared in front of everyone, never even taking a second glance behind him.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng's statue landed, it seemed to have connected itself to the entire city, and at the same time, it exuded an irresistible majestic Mu Ning. It was as if this statue was above all living beings!</p>

  <p>"This, this is the statue of God!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>"It's the Creator's statue..." someone else replied.</p>

  <p>"This statue will be, from this moment on, the Emerald Pine City's sacred object. No one is allowed to offend it!"</p>

  <p>Every warrior standing within the open space knelt down and worshiped Zheng's statue. The statue itself also emitted a sacred and inviolable Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Under the cover of this Mu Ning, no one could approach the statue. A single glance at it would make people feel irresistibly amazed, which was a creature's instinctive reaction.</p>

  <p>Sky Luck City...</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Zheng's statue fell on Sky Luck City's central square!</p>

  <p>The Grace Sacred Place was next.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>One by one, Luo Zheng placed his statues in all the major cities and sacred places of this world.</p>

  <p>After finishing the arrangement, Zheng's avatar turned into a stream of chaotic energy and quietly disappeared somewhere in the world.</p>

  <p>It was then that the Evil God gathered all the powerful warriors in the world and announced the secret sect's establishment.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the leaders of various sacred places generally didn't like the secret sect. After all, the leaders were the supreme rulers of the sacred places. Accepting this secret sect was equivalent to giving up on a certain amount of their power.</p>

  <p>However, despite the fact that the Evil God had gone into seclusion for countless years, he still had absolute power in this world. No one dared disobey him, not in the least.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Evil God worked for this world's "Creator". Who could dare neglect his order?</p>

  <p>Before long...</p>

  <p>Countless branches of the secret sect were arranged across all the cities of this world.</p>

  <p>Both mortals and warriors were to worship Zheng's statue and contribute their faith.</p>

  <p>Faith Energy continuously merged into Zheng's Godly Tile, as well.</p>

  <p>As soon as Han Liusu had defeated the anonymous man and gained the additional points, people began spreading rumors, convinced that this anonymous man was from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The Qin Clan, which ranked below the Han Clan, and the Tang Clan which ranked above the Han Clan, were both helpless. The result of the Floating Islands' rankings was about to be released, and nearly all the warriors of the Han Clan had participated in at least three matches this month. In other words, they had no chances of defeating the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>As for Han Liusu, after obtaining the high points from the anonymous man, she would not go back to the Arena of Legends again.</p>

  <p>Two days later, the wind continued blowing.</p>

  <p>Across the Time Sea, the gusts of wind became stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>The magnificent seawater began to turmoil and turned into waves that rolled out on the sea.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a few strange fish popped out of the sea's surface. The creatures wandering in the time fragments had the magical power of protecting themselves from the Time Sea's tearing power.</p>

  <p>The increasingly strong wind worked like a pair of chopsticks that got into the muddy water, continuously stirring the thick clouds. The thick clouds acted like huge spirals, circling in the sky above the entire Time Sea.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Purple Soul Hall stood a viewing deck where many female disciples gathered. Right now, they all looked somewhat gaunt.</p>

  <p>Over the past few months, in order to obtain points, they had tried their best to fight in the Arena of Legends. However, their strength was limited, and so were the points they received.</p>

  <p>Only a few days ago, the Purple Soul Hall had tallied all the points, but they failed to meet their master's requirements. Almost everyone was in despair. According to what Joy had said, most of them would be forced to leave the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>
