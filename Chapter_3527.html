<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Abdul, what's wrong with those Other Shore creatures? Why are they staring at us like that?" a senior disciple from the Land of Sword Grief asked in a low register, feeling uncomfortable under the gaze.</p>

  <p>But even Abdul was baffled.</p>

  <p>Normally, they had to be extra careful when going in and out of the Myriad Spirits City. The Other Shore creatures had always been arrogant, given their great strength. Usually, they only had contempt in their eyes upon seeing them.</p>

  <p>But today, their eyes were completely different? it was as though there was even some kind of awe in them.</p>

  <p>Were they suddenly afraid of the Souls of Light?</p>

  <p>Abdul and his companions had yet to realize that it wasn't the Souls of Light they were afraid of.</p>

  <p>They would soon find out that they acted like this because Zheng and Feng Ge had occupied the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>On the way there, everyone was feeling quite uneasy.</p>

  <p>Soon, they reached the end of the road at the gate of a magnificent building.</p>

  <p>"The City Guard House?"</p>

  <p>Abdul was rather stunned as he stood in front of the structure.</p>

  <p>"Has Zheng provoked the members of the City Guard House? Were we brought here for them to kill?" A worried voice came from one of the senior disciples.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Abdul was about to agree to the thought, but on second thought, he realized that it wasn't a very logical conclusion.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was known to always follow the rules. They even paid their tributes to the city guards every year? it was highly unlikely for them to have provoked the people of the City Guard House. Besides, Zheng was standing up against the Ghost Scorpion, who had always been at odds with the City Guard House, anyway.</p>

  <p>'Could the City Guard House have saved Zheng and Princess Feng Ge?' Abdul wondered after giving it a thought.</p>

  <p>After thinking it through, he shared the possibility with those around him.</p>

  <p>"That must be the case! The City Guard House has always wanted to kill the Ghost Scorpion, hasn't it? But the creature has always been hiding in the underground in the north of the city. When he attacked Zheng and alerted the City Guard House, they must have taken the chance to kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng is so lucky!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, a warrior beside him suddenly chimed in, "But even if the City Guard House killed the Ghost Scorpion, why would they invite us here?"</p>

  <p>Now, Abdul was stumped.</p>

  <p>The City Guard House had real control of the Myriad Spirits City? they normally paid no mind to the Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>What could have gotten them invited to the City Guard House?</p>

  <p>"Don't think too much. The City Guard House won't kill recklessly like the Ghost Scorpion anyway!" Unable to figure it out, Abdul ended up dropping it.</p>

  <p>They then entered the city lord's mansion.</p>

  <p>On either side of the mansion stood a dozen Giants, motionless like iron towers.</p>

  <p>As the group continued moving forward, they saw the members of the Guide Weasel race standing on both sides.</p>

  <p>All these Other Shore creatures were the elites of their races. Their very aura was strong, especially coupled with their fierce and bold appearance.</p>

  <p>Normally, they were considered mighty warriors of the Myriad Spirits City, but at this moment, they were merely serving as guards of the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>The grand scene before them had Abdul and the rest rather frightened, doubt growing within them. While the City Guard House had always been controlled by the Dark Bear race, they hadn't spotted any of them.</p>

  <p>Entering the main hall, Abdul looked up at the very top of the hall. Just as he got ready to bow, his entire body froze still.</p>

  <p>The other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Sitting upright on the very top of the main hall was none other than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Beside him was Feng Ge, wearing a bored expression. In front of her was a long, black table that had various dishes and fruits? it was a feast. She picked up a fruit and popped it in her mouth, staring at Abdul and the rest with cold eyes.</p>

  <p>"Princess? Princess Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>Finally, Abdul managed to call her name with great respect. It had taken a minute for him to come back to his senses.</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge held special status, the warriors in the Land of Sword Grief were also arrogant and proud in front of her. They paid their respects to her merely because of her noble birth. But the way Abdul had just addressed her seemed genuine.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand?</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't quite see all his features, they were sure that it was Zheng sitting there. They could hardly believe it!</p>

  <p>How could he take that seat?</p>

  <p>Only the governor of the City Guard House, one who controlled the Myriad Spirits City, was qualified to sit on that chair.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, don't be so stiff," Zheng said with an easy smile.</p>

  <p>"Z-Zheng, what's going on?" In his confusion, Abdul managed to ask.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Feng Ge said simply as she stuffed a dark-red fruit into her mouth. Her mouth crushed the cold, soft pulp, making a faint, fruity fragrance. The food on the Other Shore might not be much better than that in the Source World, but it sure had a unique taste. "We have killed the Ghost Scorpion, and the City Guard House has arrived to give us some trouble. I guess the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race are behind this."</p>

  <p>"The City Guard House came with trouble?"</p>

  <p>Abdul and the rest could feel their hearts tremble in their shock.</p>

  <p>"But we've also killed the governor of the City Guard House, so this place now belongs to us," Feng Ge added nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>This didn't bother many of the newcomers? it was their first time in the Desire World, after all. They couldn't yet fathom how fierce the fights among the Other Shore creatures were.</p>

  <p>But Abdul and the other senior disciples were clearly baffled by Feng Ge's casual remarks.</p>

  <p>On their way there, a strange feeling had already come over them. Now, thinking about how the Other Shore creatures looked at them in awe, they realized that those eyes were not for them, but for Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"So this City Guard House belongs to us now?" Chaim had a smile coming on as he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this will be the new stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace. That old wooden building was far too shabby," Zheng said pleasantly. "So, you don't need to feel restrained here!"</p>

  <p>The new disciples finally sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Zheng could ensure their safety, anyway. It was a good thing that this place had become the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold.</p>

  <p>Abdul and the other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, however, still felt like they were in a dream.</p>

  <p>Just then, an Ear Mouse stepped into the main hall of the City Guard House and bowed to Zheng, who remained sitting at the very top. "The savings of the Ghost Scorpion have all been recorded? there are five hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal, five hundred and twenty Body-strengthening Jades and twenty thousand soul pills! Apart from that?"</p>

  <p>For so many years, the Ghost Scorpion had occupied the northern part of the city? of course, he had accumulated many things. Once the Ghost Scorpion died, his subordinates took many things away from his lair when they fled, but a good portion of things was still left underground. The Ear Mice also moved quite fast? within an hour after the Ghost Scorpion died, they had already made their way into the underground of the northern part of the city, plundering all the remaining treasures.</p>

  <p>The amount of savings reported by the Ear Mouse had everyone shocked, save for Zheng, who merely waved his hand and said, "You don't have to report every detail. All these things will be shared equally between your race and our Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>"Shared equally?!" Abdul exclaimed in shock. The Ghost Scorpion's legacy was so great that half of it was already amazing. And to think that Zheng easily gave that half to the Ear Mice, Abdul couldn't help but stammer, "Z-Zheng? since you are the one who killed the Ghost Scorpion, his legacy naturally belongs to you, as well as the Land of Sword Grief... It doesn't make sense for you to share it with the Ear Mice like this?it's beyond generous."</p>
