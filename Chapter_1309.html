  <p>
</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Freya did not say anything. They were warriors who had immense experience on their back and had seen a lot of things.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they naturally understood that this group of people were not here with good intentions.</p>

  <p>Freya frowned and asked, "What's going on? What do you want?"</p>

  <p>The bald warrior in the lead carefully stared at Freya with a curious gaze that lingered on her chest and waist for a while. The corners of his mouth slightly rose up with a malicious angle, and his eyes revealed an obscene look. "What do we want? We want to ask you something. That's all."</p>

  <p>After that, he paused for a while and then pointed to the cave behind Freya. "Do you know how this cave was formed?"</p>

  <p>"No. How did it come into existence?" Freya asked with a sarcastic tone.</p>

  <p>"I dug it out! Bit by bit, I made this cave!" The bald warrior replied, patting his chest, as if proving a point.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was still indifferent as he played with the life vitality jade in his hand. He had not said a single word till now.</p>

  <p>Freya's face, on the other hand, was full of confusion as she asked, "Did you really dig the cave yourself? But so what?" This entire mountain was already filled with countless mine holes. If they wanted to dig out some life vitality crystals, they would have to dig them out anyway. There was nothing in there to be proud of!</p>

  <p>The bald warrior faintly smiled. "Don't you understand what I mean?</p>

  <p>Well, you're stupid. Not to worry, I like that in a girl! You see, since I dug this cave myself, all of the life vitality crystals that you brought out of it naturally belong to me!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. That's the principle!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. Ernest is right!" numerous Soul Sea Realm warriors standing behind Ernest muttered, echoing his words.</p>

  <p>Freya had already figured out that this group of warriors were aggressive and they were there with malicious intentions. However, she had not expected that they would be so shameless. It was impossible for them to dig out such a monstrous cave. After all, those who had come here before them had already dug out countless mine holes, and there might be hundreds of thousands of holes in this enormous mountain range.</p>

  <p>Even if they really had dug such a cave, they shouldn't force Luo Luo Zheng and her to hand over the life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Freya pulled a long face as she asked in a cold voice, "Why don't you just be straight? You are going to rob us, right?"</p>

  <p>The bald warrior bluntly responded, "Oh look at that! You finally understand. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"How can you take these crystals away from everyone else under broad daylight? Won't the Spiritual Force Sacred Place meddle in this kind of robbery or punish you for doing this?" Freya was looking annoyed now.</p>

  <p>The seven warriors in front of her were all at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Although Freya was also at the Soul Sea Realm, she was worried about Luo Luo Zheng who was only at the Life and Death Realm. Although he had shown some incredible abilities just now, Freya still did not think highly of Luo Zheng's battle prowess.</p>

  <p>After all, the gap between the Soul Sea Realm and the Life and Death Realm was quite broad. What was more, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't even opened up his own inner world yet, so he couldn't use his own domain. Thus he would be unable to fight against the Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"The Spiritual Force Sacred Place? Hah! They don't care about warriors from the Lower World like us." The bald warrior, whose name was Earnest, sneered in a sour tone, "As long as we offer them enough life vitality crystals, they won't meddle in anything even if we kill someone or rob others!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Luo Luo Zheng slightly raised his eyebrows as he continued to play with the life vitality jade in his hand. In his heart, he had already expected that the Spiritual Force Sacred Place would really not interfere with this matter. Thus, he could do anything he wanted right now. He was trying to be sure which was why he had been so calm till now.</p>

  <p>By that moment, Freya's teeth were already clenched. She was afraid that the life vitality jades and crystals they had obtained would have to be handed over this time. The life vitality jades were carried by Luo Luo Zheng and she also had several hundred supreme life vitality crystals with her. As she pondered over the matter, she finally hatched a plan. "I have indeed dug up a few supreme life vitality crystals. I can give them to you."</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, Freya flipped her hand and took out a fraction of the supreme life vitality crystals she had dug up.</p>

  <p>The bald warrior faintly glanced at her and chuckled. "That's great. But did you really manage to dig out only this small amount of supreme life vitality crystals? No, no... I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>This request was even more excessive. Freya was willing to hand over the supreme life vitality crystals that she had obtained, which meant she had already made a great concession. She hadn't expected that these warriors would be so greedy...</p>

  <p>However, she was truly helpless now. If she did make a move, then she would be at a clear and terrible disadvantage against these warriors. She gritted her teeth and responded, "I can let you check my space ring, if you want!" After she finished speaking, she stretched out her white and delicate hand. There was a light red ring on her middle finger.</p>

  <p>The bald warrior's eyes narrowed. He immediately stretched out his hand!</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was in the Upper World or the Lower World only, the number of female warriors was very small. And those female warriors who had reached the Soul Sea Realm and ascended into the Upper World were even fewer in number.</p>

  <p>Many of those who had ascended to the Upper World had more than a single wife in the Lower World. However, when they entered the Upper World and began mining for ores, they rarely had the opportunity to get close to any woman. Although Freya was dressed in simple white clothes, her appearance and figure were both beautiful and attractive.</p>

  <p>The bald warrior was of course aroused by her.</p>

  <p>He grabbed Freya's hand and pretended to check her space ring. Then, he chuckled. "Well, there really aren't any hidden treasures in there, but I think they might not be hidden here. They might be hidden there..." After he finished speaking, he actually moved his hand towards Freya's chest!</p>

  <p>"Get away from me!" At that moment, Freya finally became angry. Her life vitality gradually spread out, condensing into a snow-white ring which suddenly spread towards her surroundings, trying to force this bald warrior away.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the latter's hands suddenly turned golden. He gently pinched Freya's snow ring and without any apparent effort, crushed it into pieces. With an obscene expression on his face, he chuckled and said, "If you agree to accompany me and my fellows and make us happy, I won't take these supreme life vitality crystals away from you."</p>

  <p>"You just said that the Spiritual Force Sacred Place doesn't care about warriors killing anyone and looting goods, right?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning, they had completely ignored Luo Luo Zheng. They were indeed curious as to why a Life and Death Realm warrior had appeared there and were also wondering whether he had relied on his Life and Death Realm cultivation base to ascend to the Upper World. But upon seeing Freya, they had all become busy staring at her, all of their eyes lighting up. Why would they pay attention to a Life and Death Realm warrior?</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng spoke at such a crucial moment, the bald warrior replied coldly, "That's right. Don't worry. Once I deal with this little girl, I won't let you off. You should stay here obediently. Eh? What is that thing in your hand?"</p>

  <p>As the bald warrior spoke, six pairs of eyes suddenly fixated themselves on the little green thing in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"A life vitality jade!"</p>

  <p>"Ernest, it's a life vitality jade!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. This time my luck is really good. This life vitality jade is worth ten thousand supreme life vitality crystals! Wonderful!"</p>

  <p>These Soul Sea Realm warriors were immediately overjoyed, as if the life vitality jade belonged to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. "Yes, it is indeed a life vitality jade. In fact, I have more than a few here..."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Are you crazy?" By this moment, Freya was already in despair.</p>

  <p>And she hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to say such words.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was as calm as ever, and he even faintly smiled, taking out the other thirty-eight life vitality jades from his space ring. "Look, I have so many life vitality jades."</p>

  <p>When the seven Soul Sea Realm warriors saw the life vitality jades in Luo Zheng's hand, they all got astonished and excited. They were rich now!</p>

  <p>"So many! How come you have so many life vitality jades?</p>

  <p>They are actually equal to several hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals! Ernest, we are really very lucky this time..."</p>

  <p>When these warriors robbed in the mines, they could only extort a few hundred supreme life vitality crystals every month, and they might get about a few thousand life vitality crystals at most if they were lucky enough. The problem was that their group had seven members, and they had to gather seven million supreme life vitality crystals so that they would be able to leave. That was no mean feat and would take time.</p>

  <p>Everyone here was at the Soul Sea Realm, and after some warriors had been robbed once, they became shrewd and alert. Thus it became more and more difficult for these seven warriors to rob them.</p>

  <p>With so many life vitality jades suddenly appearing in front of them, how could they not be wild with joy?</p>

  <p>The bald warrior smacked his lips. Looking at Luo Luo Zheng with joy on his face, he had some doubts he needed to clear. "I don't know if you are really stupid or just too naive. Only a complete dunce would hand over so many life vitality jades so easily! Why did you show them to us?</p>

  <p>Even the most stupid man in the world would not do such a thing." The bald warrior called 'Ernest' was quite curious about this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his arm and replied, "Actually, before I entered the mines, I had already considered robbing. Compared to digging hard, robbery can help me get the life vitality crystals faster. However, after thinking about it, I kind of felt that it was not appropriate for me to do such a despicable thing. Also, I was not sure if the Spiritual Force Sacred Place would interfere in such a matter. So I decided okay, let's go legit!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slightly raised his head, slowly putting those life vitality jades back into his space ring. He gently opened his mouth, a faint killing intent appearing on his face. Although the killing intent was very light, it made those warriors unconsciously feel scared. "But now, I have to thank you for answering my question. So, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place wouldn't interfere if I kill or rob anyone here."</p>
