<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Numerous formless energy waves rushed out from Xun's spear and they contained formidable force. Under her direction, they shot ferociously towards the strange bird.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A special characteristic of the spear was that it could penetrate through anything with immediate and forceful effect. When Xun had launched the strike with her spear, she had also gathered all of her own strength and focused it on the tip of the spear. This way, the power of penetration was extremely terrifying. When the spear intent shot towards the strange bird, it instantly penetrated through its seemingly indestructible skin.</p>

  <p>"It is useless..." Not far away, a top-level war lord who was fleeing in panic shook his head.</p>

  <p>Compared to the huge body of the strange bird, the spear was like a tiny needle. Even if the latter managed to pierce through the body of the Swallowing Bird, it would only cause it a little pain and the damage would be far from enough to kill it. It would even infuriate the creature even more.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Fabian and Jarrod came to sandwich Zheng, one from the left, one from the right. Life vitality in the colors of black and white burst out from their bodies. When the two of them worked together, their strength would increase by several times. For the time being, the most important thing for them was to protect Zheng, even if it meant putting themselves in the line of fire.</p>

  <p>Although they knew that Xun was someone extraordinary, they couldn't just let Zheng's safety completely lie in her hands After all, she was only a sword spirit attached to Zheng's body. And since they were interdependent, there wasn't much of a difference between their strengths.</p>

  <p>How could she block the attack of that bird?</p>

  <p>After Xun thrust out the spear, she gently twisted her hand which held the spear. Suddenly, an explosive sound rang out in everyone's ears!</p>

  <p>It was as if countless bones had been broken, like the cracking sound of dried beans.</p>

  <p>Everyone raised their heads to look, only to see that the skin of the Swallowing Bird, which was more than a hundred feet long, had wrinkled all over. Its huge body seemed as if it had been twisted into a ball by someone's hands. It looked like a gigantic crumpled rag now.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Having lost the ability to fly, the bird fell heavily to the ground and rolled into the bushes on the side.</p>

  <p>Seeing this sight, even the top-level war lords had their mouths agape in disbelief.</p>

  <p>During the past few days, Xun had frequently walked into the arena to fight since Zheng had given her quite a few opportunities to practice. In any case, if Xun won, the Lucky Light of her opponents would still be absorbed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>All the top-level war lords present here had a smattering of the mysterious spear arts Xun practiced. Some of them who were in the fourteenth floor of the Tower of Sin had once specially gone into the arena to challenge her with the mere intention of experiencing her spear arts, since they were known to be outstanding.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Xun's spear art was very powerful, but they had never expected it to be so amazing!</p>

  <p>When Fabian and Jarrod worked together, they were able to compete with a novice war sage. If they had sufficient strength, they could also kill this huge bird, but it was impossible for them to do such a smooth and clean stunt like Xun had done.</p>

  <p>"Good spear art!" Zheng praised and continued to run forwards.</p>

  <p>"Yeah." Xun nodded after receiving Zheng's praise, her face as calm as it always was. She gripped her spear tightly and ran closely behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that the crisis was averted, and Zheng was out of danger, Fabian and Jarrod went to the front of the group and continued to lead the team forward.</p>

  <p>Things weren't going too well for them and their entire situation was still very chaotic. The Dark Nether Cave was a dangerous place. According to their usual practice, they would first lurk in some safe places for a while after entering the cave, and would then carefully move forward. However, not long after entering the Dark Nether Cave this time, they had encountered those demonic beasts. They were indeed very unfortunate.</p>

  <p>People were getting constantly snatched away by the strange birds.</p>

  <p>However, there were also top-level war lords who were fighting back valiantly. In just a short period of time, three Swallowing Birds had been killed by those top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>However, the number of Swallowing Birds that were coming down was also constantly increasing.</p>

  <p>The more noise they made in fights, the more Swallowing Birds would be attracted there, and the more desperate their situation would be.</p>

  <p>Looking at the strange birds hovering in the sky, Fabian felt a shiver go down his spine. He had a bad feeling. The human race had just begun to rise in the Tower of Sin but he felt that they were going to die here.</p>

  <p>This was what Miguel was worried about.</p>

  <p>In fact, it didn't matter if everyone, including Fabian and Jarrod died here.</p>

  <p>As long as Zheng was still alive, the human race would be able to keep their position in the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>But judging by the current situation, the chances for the human race to keep their position were very slim indeed.</p>

  <p>Fabian felt very regretful. If he had known that it would be so dangerous in the Dark Nether cave earlier, he would have gone all out to prevent Zheng from entering the Dark Nether Cave. Unfortunately, it was useless for him to regret now. Even Miguel's advice and warning were useless on Zheng which meant that he would never listen to him.</p>

  <p>"Ow...ow..."</p>

  <p>More than a dozen strange birds swooped down from the side.</p>

  <p>The flock of huge birds dove down. They came together at Zheng and several others with him, looking like a blanket which would cover them and smother them.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Fabian screamed. He called Jarrod and prepared to turn back to protect Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, they were really going to put their lives on the line.</p>

  <p>Zheng also felt the danger that was coming from above his head. As he turned around, he looked calm in his eyes. The life vitality in his belly began to rapidly revolve. At the same time, the forceful energy in the Hundred Meetings Platform in his forehead also woke up and gained momentum, preparing him for an enormous fight.</p>

  <p>Xun turned her spear and pointed its tip at the birds. She then said calmly, "We can't continue to move on now. Let's get rid of these strange birds first."</p>

  <p>Yolande also lifted up her tender hands. Mysterious lights began to flash on her fingertips, as if with a flick of her fingers, thousands of beams of radiance from her fingers would shoot out explosively, breaking her opponent down into confetti.</p>

  <p>Many of the top-level war lords also realized that they couldn't just blindly run forwards.</p>

  <p>Although they had Fabian and Jarrod leading the way, the dangers in the outer or inner circle of the Dark Nether Cave were not always the same. In fact, they changed every year and there were always something new.</p>

  <p>Although Fabian and Jarrod had a fair amount of experience in the exploration of the Dark Nether Cave, it was impossible for them to control the whole situation and avoid so many vicious beasts at the same time.</p>

  <p>If they decided to fight to the death here, then perhaps they would have a greater chance of survival.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go all out and kill them all! Although these strange birds are hard to deal with, there are still chances to kill them!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, come closer!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face still looked as calm as water. A faint starlight began to emerge from his body as he clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>"Ow...ow..."</p>

  <p>The strange birds let out clamorous noises and rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng continuously calculated the distance between him and these birds.</p>

  <p>When they were within the proper range, his fist suddenly filled with a strong power.</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>

  <p>His punch was so powerful that it tore the air apart and made a sharp whistling sound. In fact, his own sleeves started to burn up due to their friction with the air when he threw out the punch.</p>

  <p>The violent forceful energy inside him converged into a huge spiral-shaped mass and swept towards the huge birds which were hovering above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Just as a Swallowing Bird came pouncing towards him, it happened to get caught up and was wrapped inside the spiral that burst out from Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ow...ow..."</p>

  <p>Just now, several top-level war lords had launched a simultaneous counterattack against the strange birds. However, they had relied on their powerful weapons and only then were they able to manage to break through the strange birds' defenses.</p>

  <p>As for the radiance that came from their fists, it could barely hurt the birds.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave was a place where living beings could hardly survive. The demonic beasts that were able to thrive in this place could resist the Dark Nether Death Light. Even the small flowers and grass on the ground were extremely tough, so these strange birds were powerful beyond their comprehension. It would take enormous amounts of efforts for even a top-level war lord to merely pull the weeds out of the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the vortex formed by the energy that Zheng had unleashed with his fist was able to suck in the strange bird that had tried to attack him. As the vortex spun, the strange bird's enormous wings began to curl and break.</p>

  <p>By the time the Swallowing Bird reached in front of Zheng, its wings had already been twisted by the vortex and were firmly bound to its body. This strange bird fell down like a huge stick, its several dozen feet long beak sticking into the ground behind Zheng!</p>

  <p>Although it wasn't the right time to be in a daze, many of the top-level war lords were still dumbfounded when they saw Zheng's punch break the bird's beak.</p>

  <p>Wasn't this punch a bit too powerful? What kind of fist fighting technique was this?</p>

  <p>Zheng's victory greatly raised the morale of the crowd. After all, Zheng was only a ninth level war general. But he had killed this strange bird like chopping a vegetable. So they thought as top-level war lords, they couldn't perform any worse than him.</p>

  <p>Yolande had maintained a distance of ten feet away from Zheng all the time.</p>

  <p>But now, she stepped forwards, her clogs making a loud clattering sound.</p>

  <p>She looked calmly at a strange bird. With a slight tremble of her fingers, two slender beams of radiance shot out from them.</p>

  <p>The lights shining on her fingers looked mysterious. The moment they were formed, they darted directly to the strange bird and hit it accurately in its big eyes.</p>

  <p>Its eyes were blinded by Yolande. The bird immediately lost its direction. It flapped its wings, and in the end, fell onto the ground head first. It rolled around on the ground after it fell. Struggling with its huge strength, it stirred up the dust and gravel into the air. Its powerful wings furrowed on the ground, leaving several ditches behind.</p>

  <p>At this time, no one had the time to pay attention to this particular strange bird. The blind Swallowing Bird was no longer a threat, and the ones causing the real problem were the ones circling above their heads.</p>

  <p>All of the top-level war lords launched their attacks at the same time.</p>

  <p>Different colors of forceful energy erupted and life vitality flashed in the air.</p>

  <p>With joint forces, even though two top-level human war lords had been snatched away by the strange birds, they were still successful in killing a dozen these fierce creatures!</p>
