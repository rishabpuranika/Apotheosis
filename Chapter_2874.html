  <p>
</p>

  <p>Stunned, Elvis was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>He just stood there, amazed as he could not explain why Zheng was able to swim in the sea. All he knew was that Zheng was an absolutely formidable powerhouse.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he asked himself the most confusing question— why did such a strong warrior have to rob him of the soul pills? Thinking about it hard, Elvis was at his wits' end.</p>

  <p>However, when he came back to his senses, he suddenly felt Zheng's voice was familiar.</p>

  <p>"E... Elvis, I think he's the man we met a while ago," someone from behind Elvis said as he reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Wait, which man?" Elvis asked, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"The one who didn't even know what the soul pill was. Remember the man whose boat was made from the Truth of Cultivation Nature? That's him," replied the man behind him.</p>

  <p>It was not until this moment that Elvis was clear. Looking at Zheng in the sea, he felt his heart quiver as he recognized him. Stammering, he said, "You, you are..."</p>

  <p>But when Zheng finally reached Elvis' boat, he spoke coldly, "Just as I said, don't talk nonsense. Give me all of your soul pills, and I will spare your lives! Otherwise, I'll smash your boats into smithereens!"</p>

  <p>Just behind the group, Dora was also stunned to hear this on her Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>Blinking, she recalled what Zheng had told her.</p>

  <p>As far as she could remember, Zheng told her that he would return her soul pills and asked her to wait and follow the Truth Boats around.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, he was the one who swam in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Does that mean that he has two identities in the Sea of Truth? But how is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>At that point, Dora was excited, although she could not figure out why. She had thought that crossing the Sea of Truth was a boring journey, but she didn't expect that she would meet an interesting guy the moment she stepped into it.</p>

  <p>'But he's so stupid. With the way he's doing it? I bet he won't be able to get the soul pills. However, I can help him if necessary, ' she suddenly thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elvis and the rest of his group felt threatened by Zheng's presence, so they kept silent for a while as they tried to figure out what to do.</p>

  <p>To them, their soul pills were as precious and important as their lives, for they had risked everything just to obtain them. In fact, they were the guarantee for them to cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>For a long time, they had wandered around the first section. It was actually quite worse than killing them if they were to give up the hard-to-obtain soul pills.</p>

  <p>"Sir, we're sorry. It was our fault. How about I return six soul pills?" Elvis sounded shy, the complete opposite of what he was before.</p>

  <p>He knew and sensed that a man like Zheng would not be angry with him.</p>

  <p>As for the soul pills, he thought that Zheng would receive many of them all because he was able to swim in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>But to his surprise, Zheng really didn't have any other way and option to get the soul pills.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he continued to threaten them by saying, "I don't want to repeat what I just said. How about this? Since there are fifteen of you in total, you offer me three soul pills each. Then, we will all pretend that nothing ever happened in here. Got that?"</p>

  <p>If each of them gave him three soul pills, then he would have acquired forty-five ones in total.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know whether he would need a soul pill or not when crossing a line. However, there were a total of nine lines in the Sea of Truth that weren't so easy to cross. Hence, Zheng thought that the more soul pills he had, the better.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Elvis suddenly realized that he had no other choice.</p>

  <p>However, it was not possible for him to give Zheng the soul pills. After all, those were all the treasures that he and his group had acquired in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Since you are not willing to let us go, then we have no choice but to temporarily leave the Sea of Truth," Elvis said as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Guys, activate the Illusion Breaking Rune!"</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately became anxious upon hearing what Elvis had just said to his team.</p>

  <p>He had ignored the fact that the Souls of Light were free to retreat from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>If they had really left the Sea of Truth, then he wouldn't stay here either.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Dora, who was behind the fifteen people, faintly smiled and said, "I have to do something now. The Bewitching Spell!"</p>

  <p>After her voice trailed off, her chest emitted a streak of light which turned into a dark green necklace which was an obvious soul weapon.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The necklace gave off a unique soul force. The soul force spread out and immediately covered a radius of about several hundred feet around Dora.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elvis and the other fourteen people soon found themselves mystified, unable to activate the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to act on whatever was happening. All of a sudden, he threw a powerful punch in the water which smashed right into Elvis' Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>Made from the Truth of Godly Way, the Truth Boat was extremely fragile, which was why it wasn't able to withstand Zheng's punch. Upon impact, half of the board already collapsed, causing the whole boat to tilt forward, allowing the water from the Sea of Truth to gush into it.</p>

  <p>"What, what..." Shocked to his core, Elvis was at a loss for words. As long as he was exposed to the water of the Sea of Truth, he would definitely die and his Soul of Light would be annihilated instantly.</p>

  <p>As much as he wanted to save himself and the others, he couldn't activate the Illusion Breaking Rune due to the disturbance that Dora was causing.</p>

  <p>Stepping back, with sadness written all over his face, he pleaded, "Sir, please, if you have a heart, let me go. I, I..."</p>

  <p>"Just give him the soul pills. Then I will remove the Bewitching Spell, so that you can safely leave the Sea of Truth," Dora said faintly behind him.</p>

  <p>Now that Elvis' boat was broken and not very useful, he had to beg Dora for mercy. Only after Dora stopped the Bewitching Spell could he get out of the Sea of Truth. After all, it wouldn't be too difficult for a man like him who had already built a Truth Boat to make another one.</p>

  <p>"H...here you are. These are all the soul pills that I have! I won't keep any of them! Please take them! In fact, I will give you all of what I have!"</p>

  <p>In the face of death, Elvis didn't hesitate at all. Afterwards, he took out all the soul pills and threw them to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the soul pills were falling down, Zheng knew that he had to act fast.</p>

  <p>Turning around, he did a somersault and grabbed all of the soul pills that were falling from the wrecked boat.</p>

  <p>As Dora saw this happen, her mouth gave a little smirk, and the dark green necklace around her neck dimmed and disappeared within her Soul of Light. And with that, she had removed the Bewitching Spell.</p>

  <p>With most parts of Elvis' broken boat falling into the sea, he only had the stern to grab on so tightly while his body shuddered in fear.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the Bewitching Spell vanished, he finally managed to activate the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his body and his boat shook violently right before they disappeared from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>As soon as he left, his companions also hurriedly activated the Illusion Breaking Rune and followed suit.</p>

  <p>At that point, there were only Dora and Zheng left in the sea.</p>

  <p>Staring at the blurry figure in the sea, Dora smiled and asked, "So, was that how you planned to return my soul pills?"</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Zheng threw the soul pills in his hands onto Dora's boat.</p>

  <p>"You and me, fifty-fifty. Wait for me here!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, he leaned back into the Sea of Truth and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dora picked up the soul pills one by one patiently and counted them. Then she said helplessly, "There are only sixty soul pills after all this trouble. Alas, he is really..."</p>

  <p>Just as Elvis had said, someone like Dora didn't care about a few soul pills.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, Elvis wasn't a thief.</p>

  <p>She didn't take hundreds or thousands of soul pills seriously, not to mention a few or dozens of them. To her, Zheng's actions were very interesting. He had incomparable abilities, but he had spent so much energy just for several dozen soul pills. The more she thought about it, the more curious she got about Zheng's identity and origin.</p>

  <p>Sighing in surprise, she never knew that she would see such an interesting person.</p>

  <p>At that moment, she followed what Zheng told her to do. Right in the middle of the sea, she floated and carefully put away the soul pills while quietly waiting for Zheng to return.</p>
