<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 595 An Exchange Of Favors (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Though Zheng had made rapid progress to his refinement, it was still not enough.</p>

  <p>He knew that his progress was still far from those members of the noble clans in the Eastern Region. Took for example his friend, Roger. Zheng first met Roger while he was completing a task that the Cloud Sect had assigned to him. Roger was only at grade one of nature level back then.</p>

  <p>But when Zheng had seen Roger again after a few months, he could tell that Roger had quickly progressed to grade five. It had amused Zheng how much Roger improved in a short period of time!</p>

  <p>However, it was common knowledge that some martial arts cultivators could use some pills to speed up their progress. When they did, their cultivation base would normally be unstable. It was like hastening the baking of a pastry. The outside looked good, but the inside would turn out to be half-baked. But some cultivators would opt to pay the price of unstable cultivation just to speed up their progress. However, a half-baked cultivation base would often have a bad effect on their further progress.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was the pride and reputation these cultivators were after.</p>

  <p>Despite having an unstable cultivation base, once a cultivator reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, he would immediately become a respected figure in the Eastern Region. This was enough for many cultivators.</p>

  <p>Without a stable cultivation base, progressing from Illuminating Soul Realm to the next level would be like a thread passing through a needle hole. Hence, some cultivators would forget about progressing from Illuminating Soul Realm to Internal Elixir Realm and other higher stages of martial refinement.</p>

  <p>But Zheng wasn't like everyone else. He had a very solid cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, he would even restrain himself from leveling up until his body made a breakthrough on its own. This was the same as men's nocturnal emission which happened naturally after a long period of accumulation.</p>

  <p>Inside the pond, Zheng had finally stabilized his new breakthrough. But instead of relaxing, he continued to sit in a lotus position and do his breathing exercises. He felt that staying in that environment for a longer period would be helpful to his body.</p>

  <p>Although it wasn't a real dragon, the flood dragon's blood contained so much strong and pure power. However, due to Zheng's low refining level, he could only absorb a limited amount of that power. The flood dragon's blood was a priceless treasure even for a grade-six sect, so it was only fitting that it was stored in this elegant pond. The flood dragon's blood seemed endless in this pond, so even if Zheng stayed in the pond much longer, the blood wouldn't dry out.</p>

  <p>While he was meditating, Zheng heard an embarrassed titter coming from his mind. It was from the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon spirit that the cyan dragon had absorbed had nourished him and made his waking hours longer.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to ignore him. He focused his mind on meditating. However, the cyan dragon grew more irritating. So, Zheng was left with no choice but to acknowledge it. "What do you want?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Finally, I thought you would seriously ignore me! I was just wondering… Can I absorb the rest of flood dragon blood?" the cyan dragon asked with an awkward smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not help but roll his eyes. The cyan dragon had been deliberately ordering Zheng to get whatever he wanted in the past. It wasn't the type to "ask" or wonder what he could or could not get. But this time, to Zheng's surprise, the cyan dragon was asking him a favor.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that maybe the cyan dragon was embarrassed to ask for more because he just got his fair share of the flood dragon spirit.</p>

  <p>But despite the plea from the cyan dragon, Zheng could not immediately answer because the flood dragon blood didn't solely belong to him. But he also saw this as an opportunity to get something in return from the cyan dragon. He pretended to think, then sighed, "As much as I want to, I can't. You know Tia owns half of the flood dragon blood. It's up to her who to use her share of it."</p>

  <p>But the cyan dragon wasn't born yesterday. He told Zheng, "Well, you just got played by that girl. She's a smart ass, you know. The herbs in the herbal garden are of greater value than this pond of blood. Say, that eighty-thousand-year-old Lunar Anesthesia Herb alone is equal to this pond full of blood. I don't think she would need her share of the flood dragon blood! Come on, think about it!"</p>

  <p>Obviously, the cyan dragon had a wide knowledge of everything. He knew exactly the value of things and wouldn't be fooled by anyone even Zheng. Zheng could also estimate the value of those herbs just by scanning them with his soul.</p>

  <p>Both the Lunar Anesthesia Herb and the flood dragon blood were valuable to Zheng, but not to the cyan dragon. Even the valuable Heavenly Fruit Tree that Zheng would die to have could only be described as "not bad" by the cyan dragon. If it wasn't for this awkward situation, the cyan dragon would never take the flood dragon blood seriously. But because of the experiences that put him in such occasion, he had no other choice but to consume the flood dragon blood in order to regain his strength.</p>

  <p>"But still, she has the right to her share. And if I take it all by myself, I'm afraid she won't let me see another day," Zheng insisted stubbornly as sly guilt flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon fell silent for a while. He was assessing the situation and finding ways to make Zheng agree to his bidding. Suddenly, he said,</p>

  <p>"Okay, tell me what you want. I can do anything under my power.</p>

  <p>Maybe, I can teach you something useful. Say, our cultivation method?</p>

  <p>Sounds good, eh?" the cyan dragon said. Sensing that he had aroused Zheng's attention, he continued, "However, I must warn you. The cultivation methods of dragons like me aren't suitable for you because your body is still very weak. Even if I teach you some of our cultivation methods, you won't be able to use them with your current strength."</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed. He knew that the cyan dragon had sensed his eagerness to learn any new cultivation method, but he had to act like he was not that interested. "Hey, I never asked for anything in return. Besides, I have never agreed to give you Tia's share. But since you're offering, who am I to resist? I'll accept it with pleasure," Zheng said laughing.</p>

  <p>"You're a cunning but smart boy! Fine! I'll teach you a set of rune-making methods. It's one of the best attainments we dragons have acquired in runic learning," the cyan dragon said proudly.</p>

  <p>He had long planned to teach Zheng something useful. Imparting even a little part of his broad knowledge to Zheng would benefit the latter a lot.</p>

  <p>But he had held the thought for a while since Zheng's low refining stage would limit his ability to grasp or exert the cyan dragon's inheritance.</p>

  <p>But seeing the improvement in Zheng's strength and his stable cultivation base, he finally decided to teach Zheng the methods of writing runes. After all, runes were widely used in this world and could be applied to many different fields. If Zheng would become a runic expert, he could deal with many troublesome situations without the help of the cyan dragon.</p>
