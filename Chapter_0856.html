<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 856 Being Made Fun Of (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Oaks may fall, but the reeds can withstand a storm. Is it not better to bend than to break? Destruction always pursues the strong.</p>

  <p>Olivia knew this, and so did Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea about his own capabilities before he entered the Talent Tablet. Even if he did have countless skills, was it really necessary to have that label "Celestial Position" added right before his name? What did it even mean, anyway?</p>

  <p>It must have meant so much validation for such a recognition.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a majestic aura rained down before Zheng. He turned around and saw that it was an ogre war lord. Even if he had seen a number of them in his existence, he was still in awe every single time. However, the majority of them were not friendly at all.</p>

  <p>"A tenth-level war lord?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows furrowed out of intense curiosity.</p>

  <p>"That's an ogre seat owner," Olivia whispered into Zheng's ear, eyes fixated on the creature right before them.</p>

  <p>"You brat. You think you're some hotshot, huh, having carved your name this big?" Malcom's voice rang throughout the entire town, causing everyone's ears to ring.</p>

  <p>The words that came out of Malcom's mouth gave Olivia some palpitations.</p>

  <p>Her heart started to pump loudly, as if threatening to escape her chest. It had been one of the many things she feared. If Malcom killed Zheng at that very moment, the humans could have done nothing but watch.</p>

  <p>"What's the problem then?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, his eyebrows twitching from the anger that was brewing inside of him. Unlike most, he wasn't at all afraid of Malcom.</p>

  <p>Strange gazes were everywhere. Some expressions were so easy to spell out. Almost all of them were wondering where in the world Zheng mustered up such confidence to stand up to someone like Malcom in that certain way.</p>

  <p>'Is he asking for his death?' they all thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>Every race that existed would have agreed that someone as skillful as Zheng had an unfortunate fate. Ogres came for someone like him. They wanted him gone.</p>

  <p>The war between the humans and the ogres was personal, so the other races just watched the ongoing banter from a distance, staying safe from that kind of trouble.</p>

  <p>Malcom let out a laugh so sinister that it crept almost everyone out in sight.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have any idea what you're getting into, kid."</p>

  <p>Arrogantly and in great strides, he walked towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a black figure accompanied by a white one appeared beside Zheng in a flash. Those two were Fabian and Jarrod, who were on full alert to prevent Malcom from causing Zheng harm.</p>

  <p>A strange sound engulfed the area.</p>

  <p>The forceful energy was continuously circulating around Malcom's hands.</p>

  <p>It was purplish black in color, and exuded such force. He never showed Fabian and Jarrod any kind of respect. He even laughed coldly into their faces and said, "I'm going to make you pay!"</p>

  <p>Combining Fabian's and Jarrod's powers would have been a mismatch against Malcom. They were very powerful, too.</p>

  <p>But, then what?</p>

  <p>It was inevitable that the human race would eventually lose against the ogres.</p>

  <p>What was worse would be the elimination of the human war fighters, generals, and lords from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>It would go downhill from there. Things would take a turn for the worst. If both the Flaming and Dread Ogre Sacred Places decided to make their move, they had the ability to wipe out the Purple Heart Sacred Place from the Sea God Continent. The humans would result to nothing.</p>

  <p>That was the sorrow of the weak. Their lack of strength left them no choice but to endure. It was either that, or they died a bloody death.</p>

  <p>Even if Fabian and Jarrod were not afraid of Malcom, they flinched at his words.</p>

  <p>Protecting Zheng was essential, but the human race was still the top priority.</p>

  <p>It was never clear to Zheng how the black and white duo came about, but he had a slight clue about what purpose they served when it came to him.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place desperately wanted to protect him from the ogres who had only one thing in mind: have him killed. The rules of the safe zone didn't seem to work at that specific time. It was proven that even the strongest person could be attacked. Zheng laughed to himself but refused to say anything. He wanted to see for himself how else things could go.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I'd like to challenge you," Boris said, taking a step forward and surprising everyone with his gesture during the commotion.</p>

  <p>"Come on, then!" Zheng responded with a small smile playing on his lips.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he just agreed. He believed he could take on anything and anyone.</p>

  <p>Glancing at Boris, Malcom was sure he didn't want to make any move. Like what Boris had told him, Zheng died and the trouble ended. The earlier, the better. By then, no one would have the right to mock the ogres.</p>

  <p>If Boris failed, Malcom still stood a chance.</p>

  <p>All he wanted at that very moment was to press Zheng, but he never expected for the kid to be fearless of him. A reaction would have sufficed, but the boy didn't tremble in his presence.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's nonchalant expression, Malcom had the strongest urge to tear him to pieces right then and there.</p>

  <p>The heated confrontation between two races ended when Zheng accepted Boris' challenge. Zheng left first, and Olivia followed. At the end of the day, their goal was to fight in the arena, not in the streets.</p>

  <p>All members of the human race had occupied the arena, so Boris also took a step and led the ogres to where the action would take place.</p>

  <p>The other creatures that had also gathered in front of the Talent Tablet also moved to the arena.</p>

  <p>Not long, the spectator stands all over the area were packed to the brim. It was loud and dusty, a perfect day for a duel.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a world of pyramid. The number of war fighters on the first five floors was several times more than the number of war generals on the sixth floor. From the sixth floor onward, the number had begun to decrease rapidly. As for the tenth floor, it was occupied by tenth-level war generals, where talents from all races gathered.</p>

  <p>The tenth floor was a force to reckon.</p>

  <p>In order to reach the higher levels of the tower, the war generals cultivated their skills in the secret room and worked harder than most warriors on the other floors. It was tight.</p>

  <p>Due to the conniption between Boris and Zheng, those war generals had sneaked out of the secret room to watch, too.</p>

  <p>In one of the spectator stands sat a young woman dressed in a long, green robe. Her hair floated through the thick air and her eyes were sharp as knives. Her name was Cheryl Mu, a divine-level talent of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>A sight to behold.</p>

  <p>On the tenth floor in the Tower of Sin, Cheryl and Boris were always compared. The two of them were the most powerful talents among the young throughout the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Keeping to herself at all times, Cheryl had also been doing her training in the secret room. A spell of Time Law was cast on her training room, which meant that ten days inside it was one day in the outside world.</p>

  <p>The two, Cheryl and Boris, had fought twice in the past. However, both of the fight resulted in a draw. Despite this, Cheryl still felt like she had suffered defeat.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the arena, if both sides fought to a standstill, then they would exchange their Lucky Light. During those two fights, Cheryl had stored up a lot more Lucky Light than Boris. It was something that rankled her.</p>
