<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 874 Chess Piece (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I'm just a chess piece?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Right, the greatest era of this world has begun! Many talents have appeared in this world, but it is you who have the fate to lead the world of chaos. As long as you do not die, you will inevitably become the main character of this great world!" Xun said, her face serious.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had always had trouble understanding the great world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Both the cyan dragon and Mist were keeping this matter a secret from him.</p>

  <p>Every time they spoke of a crucial point pertaining to it, they broke off, unwilling to continue talking about it. Even Luo Luo Zheng, with his access to their conversations, was unable to understand the whole truth.</p>

  <p>"The beginning of a new great world? What does it mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Xun threw him an annoyed look. "Don't you see that there are many geniuses in this era? Even within this boundless world, there are countless talents that appear out of the blue. Moreover, there are over a million boundless worlds and many Upper Worlds with talents beyond count."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in agreement as he heard what she had to say.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had come across all sorts of geniuses on his way from the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect was only a small second-grade sect. It was always rare to see a warrior master the successful sword intent in the All Peaks Competition. And no swordsman had ever gained the consummate sword intent. But last time, two such talents had appeared in the All Peaks Competition that was held in the Cloud Sect. One was Luo Luo Zheng, and the other was Tianming.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Cloud Sect, all sorts of divine-level talents had appeared in the later Martial Arts Contest that had taken place because of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>According to the distribution of talents in the Central Region, as long as a divine-level genius didn't meet his downfall, he could be destined to enter the Soul Sea Realm. But in all these years, not a single Soul Sea Realm master had appeared in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>So it wasn't just Luo Luo Zheng who felt it strange. Members of the other sects in the Central Region were also wondering what was going on in this world.</p>

  <p>Xun's explanation helped Luo Luo Zheng finally understand that the great world was coming.</p>

  <p>"I need you to help me," Xun said, staring at Luo Luo Zheng with fierce determination. But what she said next was unexpected. "Please," she said tentatively.</p>

  <p>It was beyond anyone's imagination that a mighty queen of the Demon Night, one who represented slaughter, would beg someone for help.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart raced as he looked at Xun's determined yet helpless expression. He knew that agreeing to Xun's request was not wise.</p>

  <p>After all, she only had a sliver of soul left. Plus, she might still be worshiped in the Lower World, but if they went back to the Upper World, Luo Luo Zheng might have to face and deal with the force of the entire Demon Night.</p>

  <p>And it was possible that this race was stronger than humans. Luo Luo Zheng hesitated as this thought hit him.</p>

  <p>As she saw Luo Zheng's expression change with his thoughts, Xun became disappointed. She pursed her lips and said mournfully, "I understand that.</p>

  <p>I'm just your sword spirit, not your sister. And I'm also not someone you care about. And to you, I'm still an alien..."</p>

  <p>Xun was Luo Zheng's sword spirit and given the fact that she had been hiding inside Luo Zheng's body the entire time, she naturally knew everything that had happened to Luo Luo Zheng along the way.</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Luo Zheng would go all out to help even if he had to risk his own life if she were his sister, Yan, or Ning Yudie from the Cloud Hall, or even Mu Ning from the Burning Sky Empire. He wasn't heartless or indifferent by a huge margin.</p>

  <p>Xun had only been Luo Zheng's sword spirit all that time, so there wasn't much of a relationship between them.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, an old voice sounded from Luo Zheng's mind, "Little girl, Luo Luo Zheng can help you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did want to help Xun but was hesitant. The path of cultivation was an arduous one, filled with blood and gore. And even if he was very lucky, it was possible that one wrong step would mean that he would perish. Not to mention that his fate dictated that he had to lead the great world of chaos.</p>

  <p>But even if his luck was greater than anything, he would still die.</p>

  <p>It was said that the divine-level talents were able to reach the Soul Sea Realm. But how many of them could actually reach the Soul Sea Realm?</p>

  <p>Probably not even one in a hundred!</p>

  <p>There was one big prerequisite that was required of a divine-level talent if he had to become a Soul Sea Realm master, and that was not to perish.</p>

  <p>Could Luo Luo Zheng become the main character of this era? The precondition of not dying would still exist.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng agree to it when he knew that he would be facing a race that was more powerful than humans?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's hesitation was cut short by the cyan dragon in his mind, who suddenly helped him answer. Luo Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was exceptionally intelligent and known for his extensive knowledge. Since he had overridden Luo Luo Zheng in agreeing to Xun's request, he naturally must have a reason or a profound meaning behind it.</p>

  <p>Xun wasn't surprised at the voice floating in Luo Zheng's mind. Although she was Luo Zheng's sword spirit and couldn't enter his mind, she knew that Luo Luo Zheng had turned to the cyan dragon's soul for help several times when he had drawn the divine texture in the past.</p>

  <p>Given that Xun had a wide knowledge and a vast range of experiences, she was sure that the soul belonged to the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Xun's gaze rested on Luo Luo Zheng as she heard the voice and she addressed the cyan dragon. "It's no use, your agreement. Only Luo Zheng's word counts."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, just promise her. The Demon Night will be of great help and endless benefit to you in the future if you can help her return to her throne," the cyan dragon said flatly.</p>

  <p>"What I care about is not benefit," Luo Luo Zheng said seriously. "Moreover, Xun, you have saved my life so many times as my sword spirit! I can't promise you too much, but if I can do anything for you in the future, I will help you!"</p>

  <p>Xun's previously gloomy face lit up at Luo Zheng's words, as if a ray of light was shining directly on her. She stared at him before lowering her head and saying, "Thank you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly and said teasingly, "But you are still my sword spirit.</p>

  <p>You can't possibly continue to be my sword spirit and be attached to my body all the time, right?"</p>

  <p>"I will find a way to reconstruct my body, but I can't do it right now,"</p>

  <p>Xun said after a moment's thought.</p>

  <p>It was inconvenient for Xun to do many things, since she was just a sword spirit at the moment. But her advantage was obvious. She could recover even if she were chopped into pieces. And as long as Luo Luo Zheng did not die, she would not die.</p>

  <p>But she could only hide within Luo Zheng's body. If she ever came out of Luo Zheng's body and revealed herself, she would have to be near Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Reconstructing her body, on the other hand, was not a simple matter.</p>

  <p>Whether there was a chance for her to do so depended solely on her luck.</p>

  <p>Xun realized something suddenly and said to Luo Luo Zheng, "Isn't your biggest goal to save your sister? I can order Amber to bring the Demon Night members to the Central Region to help you kill Eddie."</p>
