<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's just a sword array, and it's not good at defense. Why bother to hold on?"</p>

  <p>Some masters of the Bearing race looked down at those of the Phoenix Palace who were trying their best to support the sword array. They looked playful as they made their moves.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Some of the Bearing race came from the Sky Guard Pavilion.</p>

  <p>The Sky Guard Pavilion was to the Bearing race what the Land of Sword Grief was to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, except for the fact that there were memorial tablets in the Sky Guard Pavilion.</p>

  <p>When the masters were strong enough to undertake tasks alone, they would obtain a memorial tablet representing high status. Their strength was almost the same as Flamine's.</p>

  <p>These masters relied on the theurgies of various Other Shore Tokens, which were in different forms but all with terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Flamine and the other two masters wielded the swords in their hands calmly to resist the enemies.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the theurgies these people poured out were, the Three-Element Sword Array was unbreakable and withstood consequent attacks!</p>

  <p>"Xun, Nelly, Liusu, hide behind the Supreme Dragon Hall," Feng Ge said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Xun asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"Once this array is broken, you can take the opportunity to escape. Their target is my father. They won't do anything to you," said Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>As the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Feng Ge was determined to live and die with her father.</p>

  <p>But she didn't want Xun and the other two to die with her. After all, they still had Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Little Master, let's run away together. Please!" Liusu said anxiously.</p>

  <p>In a battle of this level, Feng Ge's strength was insignificant. She could escape with them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge smiled bitterly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>People born in the Phoenix Palace could obtain more resources, and as a result, they'd have to take up more responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and her half-brothers didn't have the slightest intention of running away.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait for a moment. We can't leave the array now. Even if we leave, we might not remain alive," Xun suddenly said.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors in the sky sent out tens of thousands of Jun of force every time they attacked.</p>

  <p>The bricks and tiles of the Phoenix Palace turned to dust, having been crushed over and over again. They would also turn to dust if they were to flee at their current strength and weren't careful enough.</p>

  <p>This round of attacks lasted for a while and once they ended, the expressions that the powerful warriors from the Sky Guard Pavilion wore, changed.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected the last array to be so powerful as to forcefully shut them out.</p>

  <p>"Master Ware, I'm afraid it's not that easy to destroy the array with brute force. Please help us," the short man said deferentially.</p>

  <p>The short man hadn't expected a mere sword array to so easily block all his attacks.</p>

  <p>An unfathomable smile on his face, Ware said, "The Supreme Dragon Hall is protecting the real body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The last array won't be so easy to destroy. With your forcible attacks, you may not be able to destroy it even in a few days and nights."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he threw the fishing rod again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The thin fishing line fell from the sky and rolled towards the Three-Element Sword Array below.</p>

  <p>Flamine raised her eyebrows at Ware's action. The thread wrapped around his fishing rod was his Other Shore Token called Sky Cloud Thread.</p>

  <p>With this thread, he could break through almost all the arrays in the world.</p>

  <p>That was why he had become a great array breaker in the world.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Three-Element Sword Array, Flamine had thought she could still defend them until Eastern Emperor Taiyi woke up.</p>

  <p>And now, it was almost impossible.</p>

  <p>But she had no other choice. She would never allow Ware to break the array.</p>

  <p>"Master Heller!"</p>

  <p>Flamine turned, with the Heaven Sword in hand, and exclaimed.</p>

  <p>An old man sat on the stairs behind her. He was as strong as Auden and Pearce, but he hadn't made a single move.</p>

  <p>He had once fought alongside Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but had been cursed when wandering in Stage Thirty-two. He had encountered a kind of Other Shore Token with negative effects which, when touched, forcefully laid the curse on his inner world.</p>

  <p>His strength had greatly reduced since. Over the years, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had used a special method to help him suppress the curse.</p>

  <p>The curse was so powerful that it consumed a lot of energy just to suppress it each time.</p>

  <p>Master Heller was loyal to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had helped him survive. He felt that he had become a burden to the emperor and wanted to die.</p>

  <p>But he had changed his mind a while ago.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng got two Hearts of Accomplice in Stage Thirteen. One of them was presented to Eastern Emperor Taiyi by Athemar.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token was powerful, but it would cause the owner to sacrifice themselves.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to find a person willing to be sacrificed in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>But Master Heller was also present at the time. His eyes lit up as he learned about this Other Shore Token. He applied to Eastern Emperor Taiyi to merge with the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>At least, he'd no longer be a burden after fusing with it.</p>

  <p>He would be qualified enough to fight the top masters just like Pearce and Auden and perish alongside them.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Master Heller was desperately seeking death, Eastern Emperor Taiyi agreed to his request. At least he would want to live on after he had merged with the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>They would never let him die until the last moment.</p>

  <p>Neither Flamine nor Eastern Emperor Taiyi had expected that this last moment would arrive so soon.</p>

  <p>At her call, Master Heller suddenly stood up and laughed harshly, soaring into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha! Array breaker, do you still remember me?" Master Heller asked, tucking his silver hair behind his head.</p>

  <p>Ware had controlled the thread to break the array. At Master Heller's shouts, he looked up and said casually, "A loser from hundreds of years ago. You haven't died yet?"</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had had a hand in the curse on Master Heller. At the time, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi had suffered a great loss.</p>

  <p>"Are you disappointed?" Master Heller said with a relieved smile. "I'm going to die today!"</p>

  <p>Ware merely looked at him before saying, "Help him."</p>

  <p>At this order, those next to Ware made to move towards Heller but the loud sound of a heartbeat broke through the air.</p>

  <p>Bump! Bump! Bump!</p>

  <p>Breaking the array using the Sky Cloud Thread had demanded a great deal of effort and attention from Ware. What was more, Flamine was constantly changing the array to disturb him. And now, the sudden heartbeat was having a great impact on his mind while greatly confusing him. Where was this sound coming from?</p>

  <p>Master Heller continued to laugh loudly. "I'm going to die today, but I won't die alone!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Ware finally realized that something was wrong. The sound of heartbeat grew louder and louder.</p>

  <p>Bump! Bump! Bump!</p>

  <p>Ware was also a man with vast knowledge. All of a sudden, he realized what could be wrong.</p>

  <p>Ware hurriedly stopped the men beside him from making a move and said,</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Stop! It's the Heart of Accomplice! He actually has it!"</p>

  <p>Master Heller laughed a sinister laugh. "Stop? You think I can't die just because you stop?"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A shadow of a heart appeared above his head - the Heart of Accomplice. It then lit up; he had burned this Other Shore Token!</p>
