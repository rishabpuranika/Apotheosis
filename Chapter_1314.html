</p>

  <p>He had been counting for hours now and he was all doing it just to prove a point to those two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect a woman to suddenly interrupt him in the midst of his counting.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was excited at first since he had been looking forward to hearing Yan's voice but then he quickly deflated when he realized that it wasn't her. "It's not fun," he replied to the woman grumpily.</p>

  <p>"Then why are you still counting? Are you crazy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is quite boring. I don't really want to talk anymore. I'm going to go cultivate now," he said, finally deciding to put away the Roaring Token he had been fiddling with for a while now.</p>

  <p>However, the woman on the other end quickly protested, "Wait! Don't go. Do you want me to sing a song for you?"</p>

  <p>It was an innocent offer but a dozen voices suddenly rang out at her suggestion. Almost all of the reclusive warriors used their Roaring Tokens to speak!</p>

  <p>"No! Please don't sing!"</p>

  <p>"Your voice is nice and pleasant but please don't sing. No one wants to hear you sing!"</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey! Didn't you promise us that you wouldn't sing anymore?"</p>

  <p>Everyone spoke at the same time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's earlier argument with Amritpal and Myles was met with silence from the other Supreme Lords. Nobody deemed the spat important enough to arbitrate and use their Roaring Tokens for.</p>

  <p>However, this simple offer of a song was met by such loud refusal by all the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but be baffled at their reactions. She just wanted to sing a song. Wouldn't that be better than listening to him count all day long?</p>

  <p>"I only want to sing a song. Why are you all so nervous?" the woman asked in a gentle voice. "Is it because my voice is bad?"</p>

  <p>"No! No one in the entire universe has a more beautiful singing voice than you but you promised us that you wouldn't sing anymore!"</p>

  <p>"We think that your voice is wonderful but please don't sing..."</p>

  <p>"Don't sing. Please don't sing!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords' ardent refusal made Luo Luo Zheng curious. "Why are they afraid of hearing you sing? Is it because you're bad at it?"</p>

  <p>The woman giggled. "They don't like it when I sing, but I want to?"</p>

  <p>"We don't think your voice sounds unpleasant, but just don't sing?"</p>

  <p>Several of the Supreme Lords repeated, still trying to persuade her to change her mind.</p>

  <p>"Hmmm," the woman hummed as if thinking her next decision. "Okay. I won't release the demonic sound from my voice. Don't worry. I promise it won't cause another beast attack!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" one of the Supreme Lords asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Last time they were affected by the demonic sound so they became violent. That won't happen this time," she explained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng finally understood why everyone had been so against her singing.</p>

  <p>This wasn't the first time her voice was heard throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>A few years ago, a mysterious voice was heard for the first time. It was a woman's voice: gentle and extremely pleasing to the ears. Her first few words were still ingrained onto the memory of all the living creatures who heard it.</p>

  <p>"Is anyone here?" she had asked.</p>

  <p>It was more insignificant than the words Luo Luo Zheng uttered when he tried to look for Yan.</p>

  <p>Countless people heard this question but none were willing to use a Roaring Token just to answer her. Myles and Amritpal, though they both had a collection of Roaring Tokens, reserved them to scold each other.</p>

  <p>She repeated her question many times. When none answered, that was when she began to sing.</p>

  <p>Her voice had been pleasant to begin with and her singing was incredibly good. It was lovely and really captured the hearts of many.</p>

  <p>However, this beautiful singing voice hid sinister magic within. Any creature with intelligence felt excited after hearing her sing, to the point that they were unable to control themselves.</p>

  <p>But those with less developed minds such as beasts immediately caused a riot, triggering the greatest attack in history!</p>

  <p>Supreme worlds erupted with beast attacks from time to time. It wasn't rare for a group of vicious beasts to gather in the thousands, even millions, to attack a sacred place at the same time. They just really went crazy sometimes.</p>

  <p>This was often mitigated through the help of other races who banded together to help the ones targeted by the beasts. Thus, a beast attack wasn't considered as an incredibly hard problem to solve.</p>

  <p>However, that wasn't the case when a beast attack erupted all at the same time across all one hundred thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>There were some beasts that weren't particularly powerful but drew their strength in numbers. All kinds of species participated in this mindless attack: ants, scorpions, snakes, and so on!</p>

  <p>Once the powerful ones joined in, it wasn't long before the entire universe was thrown out of control.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely dark time.</p>

  <p>Many races suffered and the one hundred thousand supreme worlds suffered immeasurable losses. Countless sacred places and divine kingdoms were destroyed, killing various powerful masters. These were known as the "Gloomy Days".</p>

  <p>This was all because of one woman and her song.</p>

  <p>Nobody had forgotten and none were willing to risk it ever happening again.</p>

  <p>No one knew who or where this woman was from. Her identity remained a mystery in this vast universe.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord had once tried to entice her into spilling her background but the mysterious woman did not reply. Since they couldn't find out who she was, the other Supreme Lords merely persuaded her not to sing in the future and she was never heard from again afterwards.</p>

  <p>At least, until today.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's appearance and his argument with the Supreme Lords, he had caused this woman to reappear, effectively threatening the safety of the entire universe. The Supreme Lords couldn't help but pin the blame on him for this one.</p>

  <p>Still, it would be unwise to say too much. The Supreme Lords knew nothing about their backgrounds and could only persuade the woman not to sing.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the woman promised not to use her demonic sound reverberation. It wouldn't be much of a problem if she remained true to her word and just sang a simple song?</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to Luo Luo Zheng, all the sacred places and divine kingdoms had gone into high red alert status!</p>

  <p>Humans, the Demon Night, the ogres, and various other races had all begun to prepare against a possible beast attack.</p>

  <p>All sects, all sacred places, and all divine kingdoms had also done their part in issuing orders to their warriors, ensuring that every entrance, main road, and city wall were well staffed and well-guarded.</p>

  <p>It was as if the entire universe had prepared for war.</p>

  <p>Although they were told that her voice wouldn't cause a beast attack, the events from long ago were still deeply etched in their memories. There was no way they were going to be lax in the midst of a possible beast attack.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew who she was and there was no way they could make her pay if she caused devastation all throughout the universe the second time around.</p>

  <p>Vigilance was paramount when it came to possible devastation.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place Luo Luo Zheng was in was no exception. Its members were set for war with a large number of powerful masters already gathered to defend their land. There was no expectation set to the warriors who had recently ascended from Lower World. None of them really had any idea how terrifying a beast attack could be so most of them simply continued digging ores.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a clear, melodious voice echoed throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>"Reviving in the midst of the wind and leaves, floating under the shadow of the trees...</p>

  <p>The musical notes around my fingertips, for whom...</p>

  <p>The whistling wheels..."</p>

  <p>The slow and elegant melody was haunting and her lilting voice perfectly fit the song. It was like the sound of a nightingale singing on a cool, starry night.</p>

  <p>However, nobody was in the mood to appreciate her singing, save for Luo Luo Zheng of course. Everyone was just too tense and too on edge to pay attention to her otherworldly voice when the threat of a mass-scale beast attack hung over their heads.</p>
