<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Before Dillon could stop the two of them from fighting, it was already too late. Luo Zheng was already bursting with rage.</p>

  <p>Fernandez had initially told Luo Zheng to take the wiser route of coaxing a woman first to please her but his quick temper rendered the advice useless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did initially plan to persuade Ning Yudie but she did not listen and even said a few scathing words that made him really angry.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sneered upon seeing the morose look on his face, "What's the matter? Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"Right? Right!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, forcing a cold smile on his face, "What you said is right! You may be the supreme leader of Cloud Hall. But from now on, I am no longer a member of Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>There was a collective gasp from Zheng's declaration. The situation had now deteriorated to such a horrible state with a fight brewing between Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Owen figured that he didn't really have a say in this issue so he chose to remain quiet by the corner. Zheng's actions stunned him. He couldn't believe that the young man actually dared to speak to the Cloud Hall's leader in such a rude manner.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie scoffed at Zheng's words. "You're no longer a member? Do you think it's that easy? Do you think the Cloud Hall is a place you can come and go as you please? Those who leave without permission will be chased down by the entirety of Cloud Hall's forces!"</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Dillon, Hobbes, and Haber physically formed a human barrier between the two. Dillon even made a "hush" gesture that signaled Luo Zheng to stop talking.</p>

  <p>Of course, the young man refused to give in. "I'd like to see just how the Cloud Hall will chase me down and kill me!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he said those words, Yudie's face crumpled up in sadness. Her eyes were evidently full of tears but, instead of prolonging her quarrel with Luo Zheng, she suddenly released her life vitality and turned into a flash of light that flew out of the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>"Miss!"</p>

  <p>"Miss!"</p>

  <p>Her sudden departure greatly worried the elders. Although her injuries were not severe, she would still need to stay in Oracle City to recuperate her health for a few days. Morphens was quick to transform into a streak of light to chase after Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, only snorted angrily before leaving the hall in a huff. Mu Ning, of course, followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>The rest that stayed behind could only look at each other in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what they were arguing about? What kind of conflict does Luo Zheng have with Ning Yudie?" Dillon shook his head, also unable to understand the situation. Ning Yudie was the strong leader of Cloud Hall and never once cried in front of so many people. To think that an argument would send her to tears in front of so many people was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what happened. But somehow, I feel that these two were arguing like children�" Hobbes remarked.</p>

  <p>Haber silently stood beside them but it was evident that he was also thinking hard about what happened.</p>

  <p>"Right? But I don't think that they quarreled like children. It felt more as if they were lovers bickering about something!"</p>

  <p>The moment Dillon uttered these words, the three leaders' faces suddenly brightened in realization.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a monumental revelation. The members of the World Commercial Alliance just weren't aware of it before. From the very beginning, Ning Yudie did not bring Luo Zheng with her. After they met, they quarreled in childish ways.</p>

  <p>The only possibility they could come up with was that the two might be lovers.</p>

  <p>The three leaders shook their heads in disappointment. They faced a great enemy but those two youngsters chose to fight at such a sensitive period.</p>

  <p>They were really too� willful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked ahead with Mu Ning following closely behind him.</p>

  <p>They arrived at a beautifully decorated courtyard which was the place that the World Commercial Alliance specially arranged for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat down in a huff while Mu Ning fussed around to brew him a pot of tea. She dutifully poured him a cup and set it down in front of him.</p>

  <p>His distressed expression concerned her as she suddenly leaned against his back. "Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Luo Zheng hummed, looking at the ceiling morosely.</p>

  <p>"You are not magnanimous nor kind enough," Mu Ning told him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not answer and merely flashed her a smile, nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>She was right. He was indeed not magnanimous nor was he kind enough to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>He was only twenty years old. He had just transitioned from a teenager to a young man. He was someone with the spirit of a natural-born warrior.</p>

  <p>However, when it came to relationships, his youth was extremely evident with his attitude. He was not mature enough and, as Mu Ning had said, extremely lacked the kindness and maturity that were required of him when dealing with Ning Yudie earlier.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Xun suddenly appeared beside Luo Zheng and gave Mu Ning a cold glare. "Isn't this what you wanted?"</p>

  <p>Xun did not mince words and this was the reason why Mu Ning feared her. Her bluntness often made Mu Ning a nervous, fumbling mess.</p>

  <p>But this time, Mu Ning nodded and even replied, "Yes, I did want this but Luo Zheng is not happy."</p>

  <p>"How do you know whether he's happy or not?"</p>

  <p>Xun asked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning merely shrugged, "He is definitely unhappy right now."</p>

  <p>And she was right. Luo Zheng continued to be depressed for the next two days.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng's free time would often be spent cultivating. However, he spent the next two days being lost in thought and moping.</p>

  <p>As he thought of Yudie's face back then, he couldn't help but sigh. 'Does this woman love to cry so much? I just told her a few words. Why did it make her so sad?'</p>

  <p>The more he thought about it, the more irritated he became, leading him to drink twenty jars of wine in one go.</p>

  <p>Due to his strong physique, not even two hundred or two thousand jars would be enough to make him drunk. Nevertheless, the twenty jars were enough for the entire courtyard to be pervaded by the strong smell of alcohol.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, ever the neat freak, couldn't stand the smell. She had wanted to go to Zheng's room and comfort him but realized that he was like this not because of her. She couldn't really solve the problem for him nor make him feel better. She just wasn't that important or close to him.</p>

  <p>After the two days, Luo Zheng registered himself into the World Commercial Alliance. He immediately accepted the task assigned to him and quickly formed himself a small team. Afterwards, he left Mu Ning in Oracle City and headed towards the east.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect was slowly expanding, from east to west.</p>

  <p>According to the experiences of other sects, the strategy for a sect war would often be like this: lower-level warriors from both sides would usually fight first and one side would often gain a slight advantage. Once the scales tipped slightly towards one side, the middle-level warriors would be sent out, and eventually the upper-level warriors. Once the best had come out for last, the sect war would not last long and would end with a decisive victory.</p>

  <p>There was also something called "lightning war" wherein all the sect masters would come out in the beginning and directly behead the top warriors of the other sect, thereby ending the battle quickly.</p>

  <p>All sorts of tricks and tactics were also employed for these wars.</p>

  <p>However, with the Heavenly Evil Sect, everything was different.</p>

  <p>Firstly, they made use of this type of weird fighting technique wherein they did not even send out their upper-level warriors to take part in the battle.</p>

  <p>Only the lower-level warriors were sent out and they would be enough to suppress the allied forces of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance.</p>
