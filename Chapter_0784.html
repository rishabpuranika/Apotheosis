</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had pondered over the facts laid before him, the cyan dragon continued his spiel. "Strictly speaking, it is not wrong. With the usage of these two tests, the sects can easily cultivate Illuminating Soul Realm or Internal Elixir Realm disciples." The man started to look up, seemingly having a profound thought at the dragon's words. "With just a bit of luck, the sects might even cultivate an elder in Virtual Tribulation Realm one day.</p>

  <p>However, in the Genuine Dragon World, if we are to only examine these two aspects realistically, we will not be able to select a true elite." The cyan dragon finished while the game continued around them.</p>

  <p>Practically speaking, it was relatively easy for sects to find themselves qualified disciples who were both persevering and good at utilizing their talents. However true this case might be, cultivating these disciples into the Internal Elixir Realm, or the Virtual Tribulation Realm, or even the Life and Death Realm, was never the ultimate goal. None of these accomplishments were enough as they all needed something greater to truly reach their goal.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve this purpose, with the highest of ambitions, one needed to consider the third criterion: luck.</p>

  <p>The scene that was currently happening on his line of sight acutely reminded the cyan dragon of the Genuine Dragon's Wheel of Fortune. It was vaguely similar to the game as of the moment. However, the difference remained at the fact that the martial artists who participated would not die.</p>

  <p>This was due to the fact that the unfortunate warriors would only end up being kicked out by the Wheel of Fortune.</p>

  <p>It became crystal clear to him right at that moment. Obviously, the goal of Mist when imagining and creating this game akin to the Wheel of Fortune was one thing only: to be able to find the most fortunate martial artist.</p>

  <p>Even if the martial artists present in the game had varying levels of skills, it was discernible that none of them were weak. Moreover, their own fortune was not too tragic, as far as Luo Luo Zheng could tell. An example of this would be Brent, as he was quite fortunate on his own. More so, the fortune of the Holy Maiden from divine kingdom was beyond any of them could even fathom. With a single throw, she could consecutively proceed up to three times.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly smiling, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head before remarking, "It seems that I am not fortunate after all."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong. Rather, it's the opposite," the cyan dragon frowned before speaking with seriousness once again. "It is not the case that only the people with whom everything goes well can be called lucky. Some people have many misfortunes, and only after going through all sorts of trials can they reach the top of the pyramid," the dragon wryly grinned, giving a subtle motivation which hung in the air. "You must remember that this is also a type of great luck. Just now, you took two steps. That should be a reflection of your old luck."</p>

  <p>Just two steps.</p>

  <p>As the young master of the Luo Family, it was accurate to postulate that Luo Luo Zheng had been doted on by everyone that knew him. At a young age, he was cherished by his family, his relatives; and the people surrounding his home could be said to be wrapped around his little finger. Regrettably, the good times did not last long, and before he could be given the chance to comfortably explore the world, he had been reduced to a poor servant. In the blink of an eye, he had lost value to his name.</p>

  <p>"According to your conjecture, then, since I have taken two steps forward now, would I be put through a lot of trials and tribulations later on?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired as he caught up on the implications the dragon had spewed earlier on.</p>

  <p>"That is very possible," the cyan dragon speculated as he observed the other players. Although it was true that he was vastly knowledgeable on humans being a dragon from a Genuine Dragon, he was not a hundred percent certain. This was due to the fact that this particular Wheel of Fortune was designed by Mist, so in the end, he remained to be not absolute in determining Luo Zheng's outcome in the game.</p>

  <p>Just right after their short conversation, it was not long before the beam of light pointed at Luo Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the radiant gleam, Luo Luo Zheng ultimately threw out a punch. While he was holding his breath in anticipation, the dice then subsequently rolled in a perfect circle before slowing to a stop, and out came the face of the dice showing number one.</p>

  <p>The man instantaneously frowned in vexation. The number he had rolled was just too underwhelming. Just before that turn, Luo Luo Zheng disappointingly threw out two dots, and now it dropped even lower to one. Comparing his throws with the other martial artists', the dots he had acquired from those two throws were not even as many as those the others had procured in one throw. 'What kind of rotten luck is this?' he infuriatingly thought as he pouted at his failure to add more steps in the game.</p>

  <p>"Take your time and try not to be too impatient." The voice of a woman, Ning Yudie, suddenly spoke in front of him. An encouraging smile graced her features as she stood in front of Luo Luo Zheng, raising her balled fists as a form of support.</p>

  <p>The young man understood and appreciated the assurance as best as he could by nodding at Ning Yudie. However, his expression drastically changed upon seeing a purple disk that gradually materialized in front of him. 'Is this going to be a punishment or perhaps, a reward?' his eyebrows furrowed as he deliberated with unease.</p>

  <p>When everyone had witnessed Luo Luo Zheng throw out a one, they collectively assumed that it was likely going to lead to a punishment. Many of them could not help but grin in satisfaction due to the fact that Luo Zheng's cultivation base was the weakest among them. In turn, if it did turn out to be a punishment, he would not be able to withstand anything that came his way.</p>

  <p>"Well, this could be interesting to watch," some of them muttered under their breath as they hid a snicker behind their hands.</p>

  <p>Despite the doubts of the people spectating what his fate would be, Luo Luo Zheng did not bother saying anything. Through the words of the cyan dragon, he already fully understood that the destiny of the crowd lay within the abyss.</p>

  <p>Although the young cultivator eventually became miserable and desolate in the Luo Family, ever since he came into contact with the mysterious furnace, his destiny had drastically changed. His fortune had never been bad since then. Luo Luo Zheng was resolute in overcoming this obstacle as well. Gazing intently at the ominous disk, there was only one thing that triumphed in his mind: no matter what was in front of him, he had no choice but to cross over!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng had stepped foot on the purple disc, a ball of glowing violet light instantly surrounded his frame.</p>

  <p>Within the briefest of moments, his eyes frantically scanned his surroundings as the scenery around him distorted into warbled images before it finally changed. Terribly surprised at what he had just witnessed, he lifted his gaze above and spotted purple flames perpetually falling from the skies.</p>

  <p>At the same moment of chaos, a faint voice could be heard which then promptly exclaimed, "Fiery Star Flame!"</p>

  <p>When he heard the voice, Eddie's eyebrows twitched in mild amusement.</p>

  <p>He gave Luo Zheng's troubled frame a cold stare, and then a mocking smile started to form at the corner of his mouth. The man inaudibly pondered while leaning his head on his palm, 'This brat.. Lady Luck is not on his side today after all.'</p>

  <p>Only those who had experienced the punishment could even fathom how difficult it was. In fact, up until that moment, the only person who had survived the merciless sentence was Eddie. It appeared to be the most challenging occurrence to ever befall them, as all the other warriors who had gone through the punishment inevitably died except him.</p>

  <p>The man, full of mirth and satisfaction, crossed his arms against his chest and icily looked at him with a half-lidded gaze; he was definitely sure that Luo Luo Zheng would not survive this encounter.</p>

  <p>"I planned to kill you with my own hands, but you will die here as you turn into mere ashes scattered in the wind and at the bottom of our feet. This is the best you can hope for, right?" Despite his tone exuding indifference and callousness as he muttered to himself, Eddie was greatly satisfied deep down with the death of one of his enemies.</p>

  <p>The two cultivators, Ning Yudie and Imogen, glanced warily at each other. It seemed that they were both having the same concerns regarding the young man who was about to face his punishment. They did believe in Luo Zheng's luck, but at the same time, they were uncertain about him being able to withstand the burning of the Fiery Star Flame. Amidst the anxieties Ning Yudie was harboring in her heart, she could not help but worry over Luo Zheng's fate.</p>
