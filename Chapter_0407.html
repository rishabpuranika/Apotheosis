<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All Luo Luo Zheng did in defence was to take a mere step backward. The lotus in the forefront burst abruptly and with that burst, preternatural fire like a red lotus shot up in its place. The temperature of the preternatural fire was so high that it could have easily burned everything in the world!</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had jumped back in time to avoid the core of the explosion, the fire still affected him through heat and shockwave. He was pushed back about another twenty feet by the explosion of the lotus and hit the enchanted barrier heavily.</p>

  <p>"I know that your life vitality is strange, and totally different from regular ones. You seem to have that weird capacity to engulf my lotus and win even against that move. Last time on the Hell Mountain, you have shown me your abilities. Did you honestly expect me to make the same mistake a second time?" Vale remarked with a cold smile. "Are you seriously under the delusion that you can defeat me only with your weird life vitality? Let me tell you this: you are day dreaming! I said that I would give you three years, and I agreed to do that because you weren't qualified to challenge me then, and you aren't qualified to do so now.</p>

  <p>Defeating you was a piece of cake for me then! Today as well, you are going to be defeated in a second!" Vale continued his monologue.</p>

  <p>While he was talking, Vale had been calling out extra lotuses continuously. The lotuses collided with Luo Zheng's six demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>And even though he himself was speaking slowly, his homicidal killing intent focused into the lotuses was growing stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, amidst the ones fighting the phantoms, another lotus appeared and bloomed slowly in the middle of the fighting platform.</p>

  <p>These flowers Vale was calling out were normally as large as a man's hand, and bloomed in several different colors, with each color possessing its own different, unique feature and power. For example, the red lotus could afflict great damage by an explosion; and the icy lotus had an overwhelming capacity to freeze things. However, the one which had just appeared in the middle of the fighting court was totally different. It was white, and much larger than its fellow lotuses fighting the phantoms.</p>

  <p>The white lotus began to grow fast. It had started off smaller than a penny, and had reached the size of a fist; then it grew as large as a barrel.</p>

  <p>And after a while, it transformed itself into a huge white bloomer about ten feet wide and five feet high.</p>

  <p>Vale smiled as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng and walked casually on the huge white lotus step by step, without the least bit of effort showing up on his face.</p>

  <p>When he reached the center of the white lotus, his spirit suddenly grew ten times higher than before. Now, he looked even more overwhelming and his Mu Ning seemed to have been multiplied.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if his spirit was bursting out and impressing others with his great power as if it had turned into a substance that could be touched, instead of an abstract phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"Clap, clap, clap..."</p>

  <p>Several stone plates on the fighting platform were crushed into pieces by his spiritual force, as if they had been stamped on by numerous elephants.</p>

  <p>What the audience were witnessing was just the power that Vale's spirit possessed.</p>

  <p>Standing high in the middle of the white lotus, he looked much like an emperor! And the Mu Ning he gave whilst ascending atop the lotus was a reminder of a powerful ruler ascending onto his throne.</p>

  <p>"To defeat you, I really don't need to do all this. But I want to show you just how puny you are, and force it deep into your mind. You should know that giving you three years was me thinking better of you than you deserve. You could develop a lot in that time. But don't forget that I also make progress every day. You will never defeat me in three years, or even in thirty years!" Vale looked down at Luo Luo Zheng while he was making his speech.</p>

  <p>The stones which were used to build the fighting court were specially made and there was a magical strengthening force to make them even harder than regular stone. Although they looked normal, their strength and tensile strength was more than that of several metals.</p>

  <p>Crushing the stone into pieces meant the enchanted barrier of the fighting court had been crushed as well. The audience were totally awed to see that Vale had managed to destroy the barrier of the fighting court.</p>

  <p>Under this huge force, Luo Luo Zheng felt that his body had become several times heavier than usual. The gravity he felt was even greater than that on the Great Gravity Road where he took the initial exam.</p>

  <p>"It's only a few dozens of times heavier than ordinary gravity.</p>

  <p>You are such an arrogant cock! I think I should conquer your array first!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng replied coldly. Following his intention, over a hundred dragon scales in his body turned bright suddenly. At this moment, his force increased to an extent close to water bursting out from a dam. With this huge force, Luo Luo Zheng rushed towards Vale against the gravity he had called.</p>

  <p>"Is this tiny amount all the gravity you can muster?" Luo Luo Zheng chided him.</p>

  <p>Vale smiled but didn't reply. Slowly, he raised his hand and one of his fingers pointed towards Luo Luo Zheng gently.</p>

  <p>"Flower-Picking Pointing with One Finger!"</p>

  <p>With his motion, all the gravity of the fighting court disappeared and Luo Luo Zheng felt as if all of it had been focused on him.</p>

  <p>At Vale's command, the gravity inside the fighting court had been gathered into one point together and put on Luo Zheng's body! That essentially meant that the gravity he was already experiencing had been multiplied by Vale by a hundred times more!</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body fell onto the ground heavily much like a mountain sunk in an earthquake. He was forced to fall on the fighting court, and a deep crater appeared beneath his body due to his great weight, increased by Vale, making him unable to move.</p>

  <p>Vale shook his head and said, "I can stop you from standing up only by using gravitational force. You are even not strong enough for me to have to use my weapon!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood up from the crater and Vale, who was still standing in the middle of the white lotus, pointed at him again. And once more, Luo Luo Zheng was pushed into the crater. All the disciples heard the booming thud again.</p>

  <p>The fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Vale had attracted the attention of all the disciples of the Cloud Sect and they were paying more attention than that they had to pay to anything else.</p>
