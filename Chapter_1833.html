<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"There is a condition. You have to take me to the Soul Suppressing Cliff!"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu never thought that she would ever need to exchange conditions with people.</p>

  <p>It didn't help that the one she was negotiating with was a secondary creature - what they usually called creatures like Luo Luo Zheng in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The world that the Holy Being built was gigantic and had the capacity to produce True Gods, however, those who lived in the inner world had to rely on the rules set by the Holy Being to survive.</p>

  <p>Anyone who dared to leave the inner world inside the Holy Being's body would turn into life vitality and dissipate.</p>

  <p>Lower-ranked living beings were addressed as secondary creatures. It wasn't a term of degradation but a fact-based description.</p>

  <p>There were still weaker living beings that existed in the divine land who were no match for secondary creatures, but these living beings would not turn into life vitality and dissipate.</p>

  <p>"What kind of place is the Soul Suppressing Cliff? It sounds pretty important." Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was understandably something Luo Luo Zheng didn't know much of so Han Liusu could only explain it to him patiently.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a place where warriors could practice their skills and hone their strength.</p>

  <p>Those who came from the divine land, as well as the elite warriors of the universes, were all qualified to practice here.</p>

  <p>All sorts of practice places abounded in the land as well as many teleporting areas.</p>

  <p>After being sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Mu Ning, Tianming, and the others remained in the teleporting areas since there were more than enough training places for them to cultivate in.</p>

  <p>As their strength gradually increased, they were given even more freedom to go to other cultivation spots where they could improve themselves. If they got strong enough, they would then be able to enter the six great trial places!</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race was a sacred place for body refinement.</p>

  <p>Aside from that place, there was also the Kaleidoscope race's Wind Exterminating Valley, the Harmony race's Mind Refining Tower, and the Skyland race's Pristine Life Vitality and so on.</p>

  <p>To enter these places, one would need the highest grade of trial tally.</p>

  <p>Thousands upon thousands of warriors in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land worked hard to earn their trial tallies.</p>

  <p>"Since you have the trial tally, why don't you go to the Soul Suppressing Cliff yourself?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Suppressing Cliff... It's not a sacred place for trial. It is the core of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land which makes it far superior to the other six great sacred places," Han Liusu answered.</p>

  <p>The six great sacred places for training were the sites warriors mostly yearned for. It was usually their ultimate goal to be able to set foot on these sites.</p>

  <p>If a warrior cultivated in the Collapsing Mountain race, then he could easily open the Eight Path Platforms and even the Divine Stars... It was the best place for body refiners to cultivate!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also thought that these sacred places were indeed good places to train in. Since he decided to become a member of the Collapsing Mountain race, then he had to make sure his strength was on par with the other members.</p>

  <p>To someone like Han Liusu, who was from the divine land, however, the Collapsing Mountain race was nothing special.</p>

  <p>What people yearned for the most in the divine land was the depths of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land where the Soul Suppressing Cliff, the Equinox Sand, Sunflower Water Land lay.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the warriors of the divine land, that was the core of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land!</p>

  <p>Liusu's explanation clarified a few things to Luo Luo Zheng and he even began to have a rough idea of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land's layout.</p>

  <p>The ten Godly Geniuses were sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land by the Celestial Position. Their final destinations were no doubt the same as most warriors'. They all needed to do their best in order to enter the six sacred places.</p>

  <p>Cultivating successfully within the Collapsing Mountain race would no doubt raise one's strength to the level of world lord. If one managed to be on par with the Collapsing Mountain race leaders, then they could most probably be also on par with a Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>So what was this about the Soul Suppressing Cliff? Just what kind of benefits did it provide?</p>

  <p>"What's inside the Soul Suppressing Cliff?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. If whatever was in there benefited him in any way, then he wouldn't mind going.</p>

  <p>"It's a place to reinvent creatures!" Han Liusu answered with gusto.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned at her answer. "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"If we go there, then you'll understand," she said cheekily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a bit stumped with her answer but nonetheless nodded. "Deal!"</p>

  <p>Tempering his body with Liusu's flame was an urgent matter for Luo Luo Zheng but they couldn't do it here in the Collapsing Mountain race where there were so many eyes and ears.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't even move himself so there was no way he'd be able to take Han Liusu away with him.</p>

  <p>He thought about it for a while before finally coming up with the decision to make do with the current place.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu couldn't pinpoint the origins of Luo Zheng's body refining technique so she figured that ordinary people would be even less likely to know. As aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the members of the Collapsing Mountain race seemed even less interested in the cultivation methods of the outside world...</p>

  <p>With his mind made up, Luo Luo Zheng quickly mobilized his entire strength!</p>

  <p>Under the strong gravitational force, the amount of primordial energy in his body had reached astonishing levels.</p>

  <p>This primordial energy could also be considered as a type of power.</p>

  <p>A weapon refiner would often have their strength seep into the weapon they were forging as they hammered it into shape. The majority of their power would dissipate after a while but trace amounts would definitely remain on the weapon.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to use Liusu's preternatural flame to start a new round of body refining.</p>

  <p>With the constant flow of power from the dragon scales, Luo Luo Zheng slowly stood up against the immense gravitational force and crawled towards Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Once he arrived at Liusu's side, Luo Luo Zheng found himself in a bit of a dilemma.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu quickly noticed the conflicted expression on his face and immediately guessed what it was about. "Lie beside me and hold my hand."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only crawled a distance of less than five feet but he had already exhausted most of his strength. When he turned, he completely drained the last bit of strength within him!</p>

  <p>He landed heavily beside Han Liusu with a plop.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't even move his fingers. He simply lay there and rested until he recovered a bit of his strength. He then slowly moved his arm and grabbed onto Liusu's cold and tender hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's hold was firm and Liusu's heart couldn't help but skip a beat.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Dispelling Fragrance had disrupted the nerves of many, stimulating the sense of hunger in them. Another kind of primitive desire was also triggered but was mostly overtaken by hunger. Luo Luo Zheng grabbing her hand surfaced that other kind of primitive desire and made her feel flustered.</p>

  <p>She wanted to withdraw her hand but she didn't really have the strength to resist the gravitational force.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in confirmation.</p>

  <p>"I'll begin!" she declared.</p>

  <p id="top_22">The spark of the nameless preternatural flame on her body would always signal the beginning of a nightmare. She never expected that there would be someone who would come along and see this preternatural flame as a source of energy.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>The blue flame surged forth and spread towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It quickly engulfed his body in a pinch.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"What has happened to that kid?"</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors were attracted by the commotion and had different expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>Golden runes started to appear all over Luo Zheng's body and greedily absorbed the flame.</p>

  <p>Liusu's and Luo Zheng's entwined hands served as the bridge that transmitted the flame between them. The blue flame followed the bridge and burned endlessly, then it was continuously absorbed by the golden runes that were spinning.</p>

  <p>This nameless flame couldn't even be fully controlled by Han Liusu after she came of age, so there was no way she would be able to stop it.</p>

  <p>Her beautiful eyes shone with a faint blue light as the blue flame continued to burn.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng... Are you okay?" Luo Luo Zheng remained motionless during the entire ordeal so she couldn't help but feel a little worried.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Luo Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Can you absorb more?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Sizzle?"</p>

  <p>An intense pillar of flame shot out dozens of feet into the sky!</p>

  <p>This pillar immediately attracted many children of the Collapsing Mountain race. The members of the Collapsing Mountain race were extremely powerful, brave, and fearless. They were born fighters, but that did not mean that they were reckless. Otherwise, the Collapsing Mountain race would not have become one of the six sacred places for cultivation with such an extreme environment.</p>

  <p>The sight made them extremely curious but none of them were stupid enough to rush in and approach this strange sight.</p>

  <p>One of the children turned around and ran away, screaming loudly for the leaders of the race.</p>
