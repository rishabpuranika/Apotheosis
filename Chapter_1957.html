<br/><br/>

  

  <p>A slight breeze blew gently through Maha's hair as he looked down from above, and took in the view of the whole Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>His vision quickly narrowed as he focused on the blood pool at the east of the city. He continued to scan the area, and then his gaze finally landed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that same moment, Luo Zheng looked up and met Maha's gaze with an equally firm stare.</p>

  <p>It was known that Maha had a transcendent status in the Murphy Universe. He was extremely arrogant as the top Godly Genius of the Murphy Universe. He even looked down on the Supreme Lords in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>He watched Luo Zheng with mocking eyes, as if the human martial artist was a mere ant.</p>

  <p>Aside from his arrogance, he was also ruthless and tyrannical, determined to remove every obstacle in his way.</p>

  <p>It could be said that he was born to be a formidable man.</p>

  <p>He emitted a threatening Mu Ning, much like a hungry beast which had lurked too long in the dark--more than ready to swallow Luo Zheng in one gulp.</p>

  <p>And so, this Mu Ning was released on Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>However, the Mu Ning tended to radiate in nature. It meant that unless it was a soul attack, it was impossible to aim it accurately at a certain person.</p>

  <p>There were about eight hundred thousand mortals who were gathered at the edge of the long and wide passageway beside the blood pool.</p>

  <p>The irresistible gravitational force was gone since Luo Zheng had already broken the Blood Curse Array. However, it was still difficult to quickly evacuate hundreds of thousands of people, even if they all wanted to escape like mad. With so many people huddled together, deaths were inevitable in the event of a heavy stampede.</p>

  <p>Despite this, they all threw their doubts to the wind and fled for lives. It didn't matter anymore if they crushed the corpses of their companions-- escape was their first priority. In turn, the martial artists of the Sacred race didn't stop them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a small amount of the Mu Ning Maha had emitted affected the crowd that was moving backwards from the commotion.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, their weak souls felt like they had been thrown in the middle of winter when they felt his overpowering Mu Ning. Their bodies trembled as their teeth chattered uncontrollably, before they finally fainted to the ground.</p>

  <p>Compared to Maha's oppressive Mu Ning, Luo Zheng was much more low-key.</p>

  <p>His stability was like an unmovable mountain. He was like a steady rock, even under Maha's strong provocation. His deep pupils were as tranquil as two ancient wells without the slightest ripple.</p>

  <p>Yet in those two ancient wells resided a faint, invincible spirit.</p>

  <p>What was more, there was also an even stronger and more domineering Mu Ning. The invincible spirit was naturally formed from Zheng's soul and temperament, while the domineering Mu Ning was because of the Emperor Soul Imprint within his soul.</p>

  <p>But while Luo Zheng knew that he and Maha would eventually fight, now was not the time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just then, there was a sharp sound from the Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>A thin streak of light shot out and spiraled swiftly towards the World Devouring Beast. "Maha!" Connie screamed and threw herself into Maha's arms.</p>

  <p>There were many other lower level Sacred martial artists around the blood pool. However, they didn't get a chance to be involved when the world lords fought, but hid themselves instead.</p>

  <p>And since most of them were men, they threw Maha envious looks when they saw Connie jump into his arms.</p>

  <p>Although Connie was considered slightly plump for human standards, she was the most beautiful lady in the eyes of the Sacred race. She was of noble birth and boasted of many talents and profound cultivation. In other words, she was a goddess in the hearts of many Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>It was widely acknowledged that outstanding people deserved even more outstanding people. Connie was Maha's girl.</p>

  <p>Thus, the others could only look at them in envy.</p>

  <p>Then again, the Sacred martial artists also thought that only a young man of outstanding talent, like Maha, could match Connie.</p>

  <p>Maha threw his right hand around Connie and with a light leap, he rapidly dropped down towards the blood pond. After he reached a certain height, he abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>He was at an altitude of ten feet higher than Zheng's. That way, he could look down on Luo Zheng and bask in the feeling of superiority among all of them.</p>

  <p>"You're  Luo Zheng Luo, the number one Godly Genius out of the top ten in the Evolutionary Universe." He was able to accurately tell Zheng's name, thanks to his good memory. "Three years ago when I saw you Godly Geniuses, you were only at the Spirit Supreme Realm. Now, you are already world lords. Did Holy Jay from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land want to cripple you by forcibly improving your cultivation levels?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still looked up at Maha and said, "You will know the answer if we have a fight."</p>

  <p>Maha shook his head and replied, "If we can control the number one Godly Genius of the Evolutionary Universe, then it will be beneficial to our situation. A living Godly Genius is much more useful than a dead one. You…" At that moment, he stretched out a finger and gently pointed it downwards at Luo Zheng. "Kneel down and submit sincerely to me. If you're willing to be my follower, I will spare your life. I can even take you into the divine land before this Evolutionary Universe is destroyed and bestow upon you an unimaginable amount of good fortune!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Maha's words, he simply laughed.</p>

  <p>Then, he suddenly stopped and his sharp gaze seemed to slice through the thin air.</p>

  <p>"Why should I submit to you?" Luo Zheng asked. He had learned from his training in the Mind Refining Tower that he had to remain calm whenever he was provoked. No one could shake his faith.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha…" Maha laughed. "What do you think the Seven Ultimate World is? Not even human Supreme Lords dare to come in person! Since you've come, you won't be able to leave. So, it's good for you if you submit to me! It's the only choice you have left!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just laughed louder when he heard this, and then said, "So you think I won't be able to leave?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Maha's voice died down, two more space cracks suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>A small amount of dust fell down as two figures inside the space cracks squeezed their way outside.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lords of the Sacred race?" On the other hand, Zheng's eyes couldn't help but narrow at the sight.</p>

  <p>The skies above the Ultimate Immortal City emitted an oppressive force when the two Supreme Lords of the Sacred race appeared, and all the pressure was directed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were a total of 156 Supreme Lords in the Murphy Universe, 28 more than the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>One of the newcomers in front of Luo Zheng was Supreme Lord Noel, and the other was Supreme Lord Barrie. Both of them were considered as mid-rank Supreme Lords of the Murphy Universe, but their strength was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Noel appeared, he gently waved his hand and a cone-shaped light shone on Luo Zheng. He cupped his hands towards Maha and said, "Godly Genius, I've already planted a mark on his body. He won't be able to escape even if he has wings."</p>

  <p>The world lords who had mastered the Grand Teleportation technique could teleport up to hundreds of miles away. However, that distance wasn't enough for them to cross a supreme world in an instant.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was extremely difficult for a world lord to kill a fellow world lord--but for a Supreme Lord, it was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can find a way to leave?" Maha jeered. He laughed even louder and at that moment, his voice suddenly changed. His much deeper bass had a trace of demonic nature in it as he declared, "The only thing you can do now is submit to me!"</p>

  <p>"Submit to me!"</p>

  <p>"Submit to me!"</p>

  <p>"Submit to me!"</p>

  <p>His voice continued to echo ceaselessly, as if trying to drill into Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>One by one, all of the martial artists of the Sacred race below immediately fell to their knees.</p>

  <p>There were some mortals that still remained conscious, but they too knelt on the ground. They didn't fear Maha's pressure, but they couldn't resist the controlling force of Maha's voice.</p>

  <p>"Great Dominance Technique!"</p>

  <p>Numerous phantoms surrounded Maha when he shouted the command.</p>

  <p>The phantoms exuded an irrepressible Mu Ning as well. They ruthlessly pressed down on the living beings and instilled fear among them.</p>

  <p>Maha held absolute authority in the Murphy Universe. Even Supreme Lords had to listen to his orders, protect him, and were willing to stay with him.</p>

  <p>The Great Dominance Technique belonged in the top thirty skills in the 3, 000 Godly Ways. When cultivated to its maximum, it could enable one to do anything as they pleased, control other living beings' thoughts, and make them submit to their will without even doing anything.</p>

  <p>While Maha had yet to become a True God, he came as close to condensing a Godly Tile. Thus, the Great Dominance Technique had a powerful effect when he used it.</p>

  <p>Even Raleign and Leacock felt their hearts tremble incessantly with fear.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't kneel to the ground, they still nodded their heads.</p>

  <p>They couldn't help both the fear and admiration for their superior.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng still had a faint smile on his face. He was like a stone, completely unresponsive to Maha's Great Dominance Technique.</p>
