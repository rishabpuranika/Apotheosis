  <p>
</p>

  <p>The boundary wall surrounded the entire chaotic sea, forming a wall that enclosed Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>At every certain distance, the boundary wall was inlaid with a golden Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>If one were to swim to the edge of the chaotic sea, they'd see a golden light band at the end of the world.</p>

  <p>When all the Sanskrit words were in place, Luo Zheng's inner world turned truly stable as he stepped into the realm of a world lord.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, many warriors marveled at the spectacle.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was actually an enormous cave created by Holy Jay? it was isolated. There were no clouds, rain or snow.</p>

  <p>But for the first time, the aborigines in the cave finally saw clouds for themselves.</p>

  <p>The birth of every golden Sanskrit word could inspire a circle of Boundary Cloud to spread. These circles looked like wreaths built in the sky? indeed, a spectacular scene.</p>

  <p>The creatures outside the Valley of Time didn't realize that these were the Boundary Clouds.</p>

  <p>When these came into view, they wondered if they were truly Boundary Clouds. It was known that a warrior could only have one Boundary Cloud. It shouldn't have been able to cover such a large area. But the largest Boundary Cloud covered the entire inner circle of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Valley of Time were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>And the two Dragon Flyer warriors who had been bickering all the while now stared at each other in silence. They didn't know how to evaluate the Boundary Clouds in the sky and wondered whether or not a Boundary Cloud could determine the strength of a world lord.</p>

  <p>If it could, what was happening? Why were there so many Boundary Clouds in the sky?</p>

  <p>Soon after, the door to the cave where Luo Luo Zheng stood finally opened up. A man shot out of it and hovered over the Valley of Time. When he looked down in the direction of Tianming and the others, he suddenly fell before them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, congratulations!" Lucille greeted with a wide grin.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you're the last to become a world lord," Lone remarked, laughing.</p>

  <p>Three days before the deadline, the last Godly Genius became a world lord as well. Basically, their expected goal in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was achieved. So the other Godly Geniuses felt free to congratulate Luo Luo Zheng one after another.</p>

  <p>For a long while, Nathan remained shocked before finally coming to his senses and congratulating Luo Luo Zheng. Numerous times, he had been stimulated by Luo Luo Zheng, but he hadn't quite adapted to the feeling. When he became a world lord, he began worrying about whether or not Luo Zheng's Boundary Cloud could exceed twenty miles. If Luo Luo Zheng went beyond him with his Boundary Cloud reaching thirty or fifty miles, Nathan could still accept it.</p>

  <p>But what happened completely exceeded his imagination. It was simply too much for him to comprehend? he couldn't understand why Luo Luo Zheng kept surprising him so.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Tianming walked over to Luo Luo Zheng. "Judging from the Boundary Clouds that you created, you're something like a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>"Tianming, what do you mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>"When a Holy Being enters the Holy Realm and begins building the Sighing Wall of the universe, a lot of boundary-forming power is triggered and the Boundary Cloud becomes just as magnificent as yours.</p>

  <p>I've never seen it myself, but I would suppose it's about the same,"</p>

  <p>Tianming explained.</p>

  <p>As a warrior's cultivation level increased, more and more worlds grew in their inner world, of which the range grew broader and broader.</p>

  <p>Eventually, they'd form a standard universe.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe, for instance, was a standard universe. It had the Upper World and the Lower World. The Upper World included many supreme worlds while the Lower World included many great worlds.</p>

  <p>There were also a few special worlds, such as the Purple Power World and Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were a few non-standard universes, just like the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land they were in.</p>

  <p>Tianming's voice carried over to every Godly Genius's ears. "Haha! Luo Zheng's boundary-forming power is indeed far beyond ordinary warriors'. But it is still far from that of a Holy Being. Still, he's an outstanding warrior, indeed. I'm glad to have witnessed it."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Xenia seemed rather familiar with this voice. All three of them had seen him? it was Holy Jay. But Nathan, Lawson, Lucille, and the others hadn't met Holy Jay before, nor did they even know of his existence, in spite of the fact that he had helped them cultivate several times. He had done so through his six incarnations, the prophets of the six races. He hadn't shown his own form before.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" Nathan asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Lucille and the rest looked around, looking uneasy.</p>

  <p>They had just become world lords and had a new keen sense of the world. Although the speaker seemed close to them, they didn't realize it at all? they were all on alert.</p>

  <p>But Holy Jay only let out a laugh upon hearing Nathan's question.</p>

  <p>Neither Luo Luo Zheng nor Tianming said a word. Now that Holy Jay was there, he probably had his own plans.</p>

  <p>Before long, someone from the Dragon Flyer race came over to the Godly Geniuses and told them that their prophet wanted an audience.</p>

  <p>Nathan and those who didn't know Holy Jay were on alert and refused to go. But Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Xenia insisted that there wouldn't be any problem, telling the others to go see the prophet together.</p>

  <p>Inside his tent, the prophet poured each of the Godly Geniuses a cup of green tea.</p>

  <p>When Lucille and the others learned that the old man before them was the master of the land they stood in, they realized that all the good fortune they had was thanks to him.</p>

  <p>In the face of such a Holy Being, even the proud Nathan didn't dare show any arrogance. His pride came from his own talent and family background. But he had no knowledge of Luo Zheng's origins. Though Luo Luo Zheng had undeniably amazing talent, Nathan thought that his background had to be far inferior to his? his father was one of the most respected Supreme Lords in the universe, after all.</p>

  <p>But in front of this old man, his father, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, was a nobody. The old man was a Holy Being. Nathan couldn't even estimate how strong of one he was. It was said that even a True God might not be able to see a Holy Being in their entire life.</p>

  <p>After exchanging greetings, Holy Jay started, "Three years have passed.</p>

  <p>You should return to the Evolutionary Universe now."</p>

  <p>In these three years, they had been missing their clans, their families, and the situation in the Evolutionary Universe each day.</p>

  <p>They didn't have a good channel of understanding the situation? naturally, they had many worries. When they heard Holy Jay's announcement, Lucille took it upon herself to ask, "Holy Jay, how is the Evolutionary Universe now?"</p>

  <p>"The situation is rather bad? the human race has lost three Supreme Lords," Holy Jay answered honestly.</p>

  <p>He had never been to the Evolutionary Universe before, and he couldn't intervene in the conflicts between the Evolutionary Universe and the Murphy Universe. All he could do was help Luo Luo Zheng and the others in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>If Holy Jay could enter and leave the Evolutionary Universe as he pleased, then Luo Xiao wouldn't have been bothered to train these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao would have only needed to train Luo Luo Zheng and make him his successor.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had learned about the state of the Evolutionary Universe from the divine land. The war between the Evolutionary Universe and the Murphy Universe was quite the topic in the divine land, and many Holy Beings in the Hall of Holy Beings discussed it among themselves. It wasn't difficult to get a hold of the news.</p>

  <p>Since the Sacred race had declared war against the Evolutionary Universe, two years had already passed.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was expanding far faster than anyone had expected? the most critical point was that the Demon Night race sent troops to assist the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Because of the Demon Night race's participation, many forces of the human race were attacked both from behind and in front.</p>

  <p>"I don't have any specific information. After all, it's a matter between Murphy and Luo Xiao; other Holy Beings have no reason to interfere. I can't touch Murphy now." Holy Jay himself was a member of the Hall of Holy Beings. Although Luo Xiao used to be a member as well, he was on the verge of dying and Holy Jay couldn't get involved.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Lawson asked urgently. There were only about twenty human Supreme Lords; he was afraid that the patriarch of his clan would be killed.</p>

  <p>After giving Lawson a look, Holy Jay turned to Luo Luo Zheng. "There is no better way to win this war. Besides the competition between the Supreme Lords, this is also the game between the True Gods of the two universes.</p>

  <p>If two or three of you can become True Gods, the Evolutionary Universe should also be able to stabilize and end this war. I came here to send you back."</p>
