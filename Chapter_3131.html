  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded resolutely. "Yes, I am going up the mountain."</p>

  <p>Back in the Mountain Viewing Province, he had been chased by Phoenix.</p>

  <p>She had been a great opponent, and Luo Zheng was forced to use every trick up his sleeve. As a result, Qiu Yinhe realized his true identity.</p>

  <p>Once he had been exposed, Luo Zheng was left with only two choices? either to go up the mountain, or to leave the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe was very explicit about this.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace was one of the three orthodox forces of human race. In addition, it was traditionally a place for cultivating swordsmanship? just what Luo Zheng needed.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Luo Zheng learnt from Qiu Yinhe that the path the Taiyi Heaven Palace had taken did not conflict with him and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng ultimately chose to go up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's answer, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace fell into silence once more.</p>

  <p>They all knew what going up the mountain meant. However, they also were keenly aware of Luo Zheng's capabilities; he was more than qualified for this quest.</p>

  <p>Although these disciples were unwilling to let Luo Zheng leave, it would've seemed selfish if they tried to stop him.</p>

  <p>Beldene regarded the silent crowd. "The Flag Master is a truly genius. You know, it's a waste of his talent to remain in the Dragon City. He's helped us enough. Now, he's been chosen to go up the mountain. This means the Taiyi Heaven Palace is able to spot genius. We must give him our blessing!"</p>

  <p>"Beldene is right!" echoed Jago.</p>

  <p>"The Flag Master has already helped us a lot!"</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for the Flag Master, we wouldn't even be able to cross the Sword Wall..."</p>

  <p>"We should concentrate on our cultivation, so we can also go up the mountain in the future."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere gradually changed from regret to excitement and determination.</p>

  <p>Even though the disciples of the Sword Light Palace had only been in the Dragon City for a year, their mentality had changed a lot.</p>

  <p>Disciples like Beldene and Elgin were absolute geniuses back in the Sword Light Palace. However, in the Dragon City, many other bright disciples had gathered. This humbled them greatly, reminding them that there was always someone in this world that was stronger than them.</p>

  <p>Even the playboys of the Sword Light Palace, including Jago, had completely concentrated on cultivation, inspired to keep up with those geniuses' pace.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for you, Flag Master, I wouldn't even be able to enter the Sword Light Palace, let alone the Dragon City..." Kenelm sadly said under his breath.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng went to the Excellence City, Kenelm had asked him if he could be his helper. Kenelm had never thought that such a person would bring him from the Gracious Province to the Seven-Star Province, and then further still? all the way to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Everything he experienced the past year was like a dream to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to him, and patted him reassuringly on the shoulder. "But you've made it this far, haven't you? Maybe you can also go up the mountain one day." Luo Zheng smiled warmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm already very satisfied with what I've accomplished," replied Kenelm sincerely. "As for going up the mountain, I don't dare to dream too much..."</p>

  <p>In actuality, the Dragon City was already a sacred place in his heart, and joining the Taiyi Heaven Palace was something he had hardly dared to hope for.</p>

  <p>It was indeed very difficult for Kenelm to go up the mountain, because he was the most mediocre one among these people.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever think about reaching the Dragon City before?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Kenelm shook his head. He had never imagined that he would have such an experience and come to the scared place in his heart.</p>

  <p>"That's it. As long as you work hard, everything is possible," Luo Zheng encouraged him.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Kenelm nodded resolutely.</p>

  <p>That night, all of them stopped cultivating to bid Luo Zheng farewell.</p>

  <p>Monica moved the flag of the Alliance Chief in a slightly remote position.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Light Palace lit a bonfire before surrounding Luo Zheng, chattering amongst themselves excitedly.</p>

  <p>Monica, on the other hand, fell quiet.</p>

  <p>It was true she was still shocked that she was suddenly appointed the Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>As one of the three Grand Flag Masters outside the Dragon City, when Walter left, she did have a chance to take his place. However, she knew Walter wasn't that strong; she didn't know how long he would stay in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Her brows furrowed. More importantly, Luo Zheng could make the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Of course, Monica was keenly aware as to how Fergus had built his status from the ground up: by selling the Sword-reading Liquid. Thus, it was a very precious opportunity for her to sell the liquid for Luo Zheng, a talent who was capable of Instant Enlightenment. Monica knew this.</p>

  <p>She almost couldn't accept the fact that she had met such a good chance.</p>

  <p>"Are you unhappy, Monica?" Luo Zheng asked teasingly.</p>

  <p>"How can I be unhappy when I've been promoted to Alliance Chief?"</p>

  <p>Monica replied with a forced smile. "It just feels like... it happened too easily. It all feels like a dream..."</p>

  <p>"Dreams can come true, you know," Luo Zheng said with a kind smile.</p>

  <p>"That's true..."</p>

  <p>"When I go up the mountain, please take care of these disciples," Luo Zheng pleaded, looking at the people chatter and laugh amongst themselves, sitting around the fire.</p>

  <p>Monica nodded. She knew the camaraderie formed between Luo Zheng and these disciples. After all, Luo Zheng had been helping these disciples ever since the Sword Wall. Monica knew she would take his place as leader and protector of these people.</p>

  <p>The night passed quickly.</p>

  <p>Though these people did not sleep at all that night, their spirits remained at an all-time high.</p>

  <p>After dawn, Luo Zheng set for the Dragon City alone. The disciples had offered to see him off, but Luo Zheng declined. Going up the mountain didn't mean that Luo Zheng would never see them again; he still had a lot of opportunities to come back in the future.</p>

  <p>As soon as he arrived in the Dragon City, he went to see Sellers.</p>

  <p>Sellers showed no signs of surprise when Luo Zheng declared that he was about to go up the mountain.</p>

  <p>According to tradition, Luo Zheng needed Sellers' recommendation. But considering that Qiu Yinhe was the cause for this situation, Sellers thought he should report this to him in advance. However, when Luo Zheng showed him the golden Sword Card, he knew he didn't need to report this to Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, please," said Sellers, gesturing for Luo Zheng to follow.</p>

  <p>Weaving through the streets till they exited the Dragon City, Sellers led Luo Zheng straight to the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>The huge mountain loomed before them, like a giant beast slumbering. It had been here since time immemorial, its intimidating height daunting to anyone who considered climbing it.</p>

  <p>The two climbed along the mountain path at an extremely fast pace. After what seemed like ages, they looked back, only to see that the Dragon City was but a speck in the distance. However, trudging onward, it felt like they had only reached the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, they finally reached the middle of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed Sellers into a neat palace, and the latter instructed him to wait at the door before entering.</p>

  <p>When Sellers finally emerged, a middle-aged man in a white robe had joined him.</p>

  <p>This man was Calum Gu. He was responsible for checking on all the disciples who tried to climb up the mountain. Sellers was only meant to give his recommendation.</p>

  <p>After taking a look at Luo Zheng's Sword Card, Calum Gu nodded. "It's indeed the Sword Card from the Taiyi Governor!"</p>

  <p>Then he pointed to the road snaking up the mountain. "Starting from here, you have to go up the mountain by yourself. If you encounter any trouble along the way, it is up to you to handle it. At the top of the mountain, there will be someone waiting for you."</p>

  <p>It was a difficult climb. Although Sellers had recommended numerous people before, only one out of ten ever made it.</p>

  <p>"With your strength, I have no doubt you will reach the top of the mountain." Sellers smiled. "Just be careful on the road."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for everything, Sir," Luo Zheng responded, bowing respectfully.</p>

  <p>Calum Gu looked at Sellers in surprise. "Sellers, why are you so confident in this man?" He asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Having Qiu Yinhe's Sword Card only meant that Qiu Yinhe thought very highly of Luo Zheng. There had been many people trying to go up the mountain from ancient times, but who could guarantee that they would be able to make it?</p>

  <p>"He has Qiu Yinhe's recommendation, so he is by no means an ordinary person," Sellers replied, with a smile on his face. As Qiu Yinhe had warned him before, he couldn't reveal too much to Calum Gu.</p>

  <p>Calum Gu shook his head. "I don't think so. Those Taiyi Governors have all recommended some people, but many of them even fell from the mountain! They were not as good as those you recommended in the past..."</p>

  <p>As they discussed, they both watched Luo Zheng's receding figure in the distance as he trekked on the road that snaked towards the mountaintop.</p>
