  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God was restrained by his very own cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Although he had dabbled in such Divine Dao, he could only ever manage to master twenty to thirty percent of each of them because he was a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had broken through as a consummate True God, the Evil God could also just as likely improve his cultivation base and comprehend more Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Surprise came over Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had learned quite a lot from Fuxi's Eight Diagrams Chart. If he hadn't, it would've taken much more time before he could become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>But the most important fact remained? Luo Zheng was unique amongst the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>With the Infinity Ruler's help, Luo Zheng managed to quickly absorb nearly all the Divine Dao he had witnessed with his own eyes. Once fully absorbed, they were wholly owned.</p>

  <p>Similar to the Evil God's situation, his cultivation base was also limited in the past.</p>

  <p>Now that he had become a consummate True God, he could also use the consummate level of the other Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>When the light shooting up into the sky slowly dissipated, his Godly Tile began spinning slowly as his inner world rapidly expanded.</p>

  <p>As more continents rose out of the chaotic sea, the water seemed to broaden tenfold? the distance between the Sanskrit words constraining his inner world also expanded.</p>

  <p>Soon after the scene, Luo Zheng slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Still sitting cross-legged, he extended his arm and a long sword appeared in his grasp.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wouldn't dream of taking out his Shadow Bearing Sword in front of Fuxi. Although the latter showed no hostility and had even helped him break through, Luo Zheng couldn't bring himself to trust Fuxi so soon.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of the long sword, a wisp of sword intent slowly spiraled up the blade.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Zheng was once again immersed in the state of Nothingness In One. His sword was producing some kind of matchless energy.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to slice through the air, a finger stopped the sword.</p>

  <p>This finger acted as a black hole? as soon as it touched the sword, the built-up energy had vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>"Don't destroy my mountain," Fuxi simply said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had intended to use his sword to test the power of the consummation level of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. When Fuxi stopped him, he smiled.</p>

  <p>And then Luo Zheng stood up to lightly bow to Fuxi. "Thank you for your help.</p>

  <p>I'm deeply grateful."</p>

  <p>But Fuxi seemed down for some reason. With a wave of his hand, he leaned against the tombstone and closed his eyes shut.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to stay any longer, after expressing his gratitude, Luo Zheng turned to leave.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Luo Zheng had rushed off that Fuxi opened his eyes to take a peek at the figure vanishing in the distance. "He has inherited Chiyou's 3, 000 Divine Dao and opened up the Thousand Sanskrit Land. Now, he's been chosen by a Chaos Ancient God. I wonder what Chiyou is feeling if he does know about it."</p>

  <p>With his broad vision, Fuxi could pick up several clues in a single glance. But he wasn't particularly interested in questioning the details any further and Luo Zheng wasn't willing to tell him, anyway.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of Luo Zheng's origins and had figured out that Luo Zheng was an important asset to the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>After all, very few members of the great races in the Source World could dream of opening up the Thousand Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>In the distance, Luo Zheng climbed over the low mountain and returned to the Equality Altar.</p>

  <p>Many exiles were waiting for him there.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>When Timotheus, Ramzi and the others saw a figure arrive, their eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"Did Fuxi cause you any trouble?" Timotheus asked in concern.</p>

  <p>Their greatest worry, of course, was Luo Zheng's safety. So long as he was alright, they figured everything would turn out fine.</p>

  <p>But if something happened to Luo Zheng, they had no other way to deal with Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"You've become a consummate True God?" Ramzi's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes, Master Fuxi has helped me a lot."</p>

  <p>Without the help of the Eight Diagrams Chart, Luo Zheng would have needed to explore the Emotion Closing Divine Dao little by little? reaching the consummation of True God Realm would've seemed far out of sight and reach.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Luo Zheng. Luther will help you cut off the Curse Chain,"</p>

  <p>Emily said with a smile nearby.</p>

  <p>Luther stepped out alongside her with a short sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he cut off Luo Zheng's Curse Chain, all those lucky enough to have stepped into this space sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>But the world didn't consist of only the people there? there was also quite a number of Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>It was a huge project that cost much time cutting off the Curse Chains of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

  <p>But they were the descendants of exiles, with exiles' blood flowing through their bodies? they wouldn't be left behind.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng was cut loose, he and the others returned to the bone tower first.</p>

  <p>Each great race left one or two exiles behind to help Luther cut off the Curse Chains.</p>

  <p>A few days later at the foot of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, several exiles of the Fire Melting race came to say goodbye.</p>

  <p>After situating over ten thousand Wild Gods of their race into their inner worlds, they flew deep into the sky.</p>

  <p>The chaos was too vast for anyone to even imagine.</p>

  <p>Even the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm found that it would be a long and difficult path to tread as they returned to the Source World.</p>

  <p>But it didn't matter? everyone was eager to return as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The Fire Melting race was followed by the Star Deer race, the Mysterious Oni race etc.</p>

  <p>Not all the Wild Gods chose to leave.</p>

  <p>Some of them were born and raised in this world? they did not want to leave with their races' exiles.</p>

  <p>Though well aware that they'd soon face a difficult time without the exiles protecting them, they stubbornly refused to leave.</p>

  <p>And so the exiles didn't force them to come along.</p>

  <p>A month later</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A ray of sword radiance which was ten thousand feet long shot from the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>When the sword radiance was released, its power had covered hundreds of miles outward.</p>

  <p>There was a certain decisive power from this radiance as though it could cut everything between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance rushed forward rapidly and cut through the back of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>In spite of the radiance being extremely sharp, it was still unable to leave any trace on the bone tower.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was quite satisfied with the strike.</p>

  <p>"After I achieved the consummation of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, this sword strike has become five times more powerful than the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>In this case, I'm sure the power of the Ways-blending Strike can be increased even further. I can't use it now, unfortunately."</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's cultivation base was improved, he had to merge the energy once again because it wasn't yet perfect.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Zheng hadn't yet been able to employ the theurgies at the consummation level of other Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Over the past month, Luo Zheng had continuously made progress in his sword strike. Meanwhile, he had been using the Truth of Cultivation Nature to re-merge the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But combining the consummation-level theurgies into one was undoubtedly a much more difficult task? doing so would take a long time.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng saw several beams of light suddenly flash in the sky. They came rapidly from a distance, the one in the lead pulling a long, colorful ribbon of light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at the sight. The Snake Goddess race was also ready.</p>

  <p>Emily had already agreed to go into the divine land with Timotheus and the others to assist him. At long last, it was finally time for their journey to begin.</p>
