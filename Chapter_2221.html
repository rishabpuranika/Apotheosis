<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the Floating Island of the Tang Clan, a young man in his early twenties walked out of the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Herman, the warrior who had just lost to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Outside the Jade Wall of Legends stood a dozen people from the Tang Clan, and among them was a middle-aged man with grey hair.</p>

  <p>He had a square face, big eyes, long eyebrows, a long pointed beard, and faint flames on his forehead, which, when all combined together, gave off an intimidating aura.</p>

  <p>This middle-aged man was Herman's father, Conrad Tang. He was a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Herman returned to the Floating Island of his clan after his cultivation in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. This was the first time that he had stepped into the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Conrad had trained his son with great effort, so he was eager to see his son's performance. That was why he had brought his son to the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Conrad had absolute confidence in his son's strength.</p>

  <p>The proving godly warriors on the Floating Islands were not weak. But since Herman was a new arrival in the Arena of Legends, he was consecutively paired with other new arrivals. Hence, the opponents he met weren't very strong and he was able to win repeatedly. Conrad estimated that Herman could get at least ten consecutive wins in four hours, and that he would meet his real opponents only after twenty consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>However, when Herman withdrew from the Jade Wall of Legends, green words slowly floated up from the bottom of the wall, indicating that he had lost.</p>

  <p>"Herman was defeated?"</p>

  <p>"Did he let his opponent go on purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Did he meet a talent from another big clan?"</p>

  <p>The True Gods present looked at one another, unable to make sense of what was happening.</p>

  <p>Of course, no one was as surprised as Conrad was. "Nobody at the same level as Herman can defeat him and his powerful body. So how could Herman lose in the very first round?"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The light on the Jade Wall of Legends that enveloped Herman disappeared. With a gloomy expression, Herman stood up from the ground. His mind was blank.</p>

  <p>"Herman, what kind of opponent did you encounter? Why were you defeated in the first round?" Conrad asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Although Conrad was a Demi-holy Being, he didn't have many sons.</p>

  <p>Herman was the most talented son he had in recent decades. Therefore, he cared about him very much.</p>

  <p>The True Gods around them all curiously turned their attention to Herman, wanting to know what had happened. This was a result that none of them could have predicted.</p>

  <p>Herman pouted and said helplessly, "Father, it was my bad luck. I ran into a monster in my very first round."</p>

  <p>"A monster?" Conrad and the others were stunned to hear this. "Do you mean he was very powerful? How did he manage to withstand your great strength?" Conrad asked in disbelief. If his son described someone as a monster, he or she must be truly powerful.</p>

  <p>With a resentful look on his face, Herman explained, "He was so quick that he made a move before I could even activate my body. Also, his soul is incredibly strong. In fact, it seems to be even stronger than those of ordinary low-rank True Gods."</p>

  <p>At this, the entire place broke out into murmurs of disbelief. "What?"</p>

  <p>"How can the strength of a proving godly warrior's soul be comparable to that of a True God's?"</p>

  <p>"Which clan is he from? Is he really that talented?"</p>

  <p>The truth was, most of the people present were cynical about what Herman had just said, but since he was Conrad's son, they didn't dare to contradict him or express their doubts.</p>

  <p>There were not many excellent proving godly warriors on the Floating Islands. Almost every clan had a few talented warriors, but they could cultivate the Gold Fighting Soul at most. No one, not even Conrad, had ever seen a young man from any clan who could cultivate the True God Soul.</p>

  <p>"A strong soul alone is not enough to defeat you," Conrad finally said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"It's not just that he has a strong soul. His strength and speed are far beyond those of proving godly warriors. He defeated me with just one move. He didn't use any martial art or Godly Way. I suspect that he must have cheated! I dare say he's a True God!" Herman answered back.</p>

  <p>The True Gods present remained silent. They knew that this was simply impossible and almost felt embarrassed on Herman's behalf that he was trying to justify his defeat with such a far-fetched explanation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Conrad, looking at the anxious expression on Herman's face, said reassuringly with a faint smile, "I guess you met a talent from a big clan, due to your bad luck. But don't be discouraged.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, no one has been able to win every match in the Arena of Legends. Draw lessons from this defeat and be prepared for the next fight."</p>

  <p>"I see," Herman said with a nod, feeling a little better after hearing that he was not alone in his defeat.</p>

  <p>Anyway, taking the first blow in the Arena of Legends was not necessarily a bad thing for him; it let him know his own strength.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of the opponent you faced? Which clan does he belong to?" Conrad asked.</p>

  <p>"His name is Tianxing Luo. He is from the Han Clan." The Jade Wall of Legends didn't display any information about Herman's opponent to the audience. However, before entering the arena, Herman could see his opponent's name and clan.</p>

  <p>"His surname is Luo? You say he is from the Han Clan, but he has a different surname," Conrad murmured. "It's the first time that he has stepped into the Arena of Legends. It seems that he didn't grow up on the Floating Island."</p>

  <p>Although Herman hadn't given him much information, Conrad had made a fairly accurate judgment.</p>

  <p>But he didn't dwell much on Tianxing. New talents appeared in the Time Sea every day, but most of them were merely passers-by on the stage of history. A mere proving godly warrior was not enough to hold Conrad's attention.</p>

  <p>On the Floating Island where the Han Clan lived, Zheng also left the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>After the light enveloping him dissipated, he leapt up with a relaxed expression on his face. The wall behind him already showed his victory, and there was a "one" marked after his name.</p>

  <p>When Madam Moon saw this, a look of surprise appeared on her face, which now looked mismatched with her bloated body. She was not surprised that Zheng had defeated his opponent, but rather that it had taken him such a short time to do it.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, I didn't fail you. I won the first round," Zheng said with a smile, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon shook her head. "You were just lucky. You faced an opponent that also stepped into the Arena of Legends for the first time.</p>

  <p>He was too weak to be your opponent, so it doesn't count."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders in agreement. "He was indeed too weak."</p>

  <p>If Conrad and Herman had heard this conversation, they would have been furious.</p>

  <p>In fact, Madam Moon herself would have eaten her words and been a lot more appreciative of Zheng's abilities if she had known that his opponent was actually the son of a Demi-holy Being. But Zheng genuinely felt that Herman's strength was very ordinary.</p>

  <p>"Go and fight again. You must win five consecutive rounds to prove your strength," Madam Moon said coldly.</p>

  <p>Hearing what she had said, the female disciples present exchanged glances with one another. They were all worried about Zheng.</p>

  <p>The opponents that one would encounter in the Arena of Legends could be either strong or weak. Even though Zheng had been lucky enough to encounter a weak opponent in his first round, he might not be so lucky in the next round. Perhaps he would have to face a talent from a big clan. In that case, he would definitely lose. Madam Moon was actually trying to embarrass Zheng by asking him to win five consecutive rounds.</p>

  <p>The female disciples felt indignant on Zheng's behalf, but no one dared to speak up for him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not hesitate even a little. The battle he had just won was not even a warm-up for him. After he turned around, he activated the jade token again and entered the Jade Wall of Legends for the second time.</p>

  <p>In the illusory space, his second opponent appeared.</p>

  <p>This time, his opponent was a rough-looking man with a fierce expression on his face. As soon as he appeared in the arena, he opened his mouth with the intention of saying something malicious to threaten Zheng and shake his morale.</p>

  <p>However, the words he had prepared in his head didn't even leave his throat before he found himself crushed under Zheng's foot. "You're much weaker than my first opponent. The disciples of the wealthy clans are far inferior to what I have imagined," said Zheng, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"You, you..." The man under his foot kept struggling.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down at the man and smiled. "By the way, aura doesn't come from your mouth. It's a reflection of your strength!" With these words, Zheng pressed his foot down harder on the man, and soon, he heard the crack of bones breaking. The second battle was over.</p>

  <p>Zheng's first battle in the Arena of Legends had lasted only for about a minute, including the time Herman had sprouted nonsense.</p>

  <p>Now, his second battle had lasted less than that: a mere 27 seconds.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon saw Zheng activate his jade token and enter the Arena of Legends under the glow of light. But before she could even come back to her senses, Zheng had already finished the battle. The Jade Wall of Legends showed that he had once again won.</p>
