<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>


  <p>
</p>

  <p>The face of the leader of the Nineteenth Cave Humans turned pale as his knees trembled out of fear. Desperate as he was, he begged for mercy in a pitiful state, "Please spare my life! I don't mean to speak for them."</p>

  <p>"Then what did you mean? Tell me!" As the horrible man stomped his foot on the leader's chest with rage, the force under his feet surged and formed ripples far and wide.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The crackling sound of breaking ribs filled the air as the leader spat out blood from his mouth from his internal injuries. Just the simple act of the man's foot coming in contact with his chest had caused so much damage.</p>

  <p>Had he used more force, the leader's body would have been reduced to shreds.</p>

  <p>"The... the bat race sucked your Bull Lion's blood, and they deserve to be killed!" the leader said as he coughed out blood from his mouth.</p>

  <p>It was apparent he was only saying those things so the man could spare his life.</p>

  <p>"Humph! How nice of you. If only these nonhuman creatures would stop testing my patience. Since they refuse to, they are doomed. Not only will I end the bats, but I might as well kill every nonhuman creature in this mountain!" The man sneered as he knocked his fists together to assert dominance.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why would you do such a thing..." The leader lowered his gaze to the ground in disbelief as he did not expect the man would be so unforgiving.</p>

  <p>When the nonhuman creatures witnessed the spectacle of his strength from afar, they did not dare to reveal themselves. The last thing they wanted was to face the same fate as the bat race and the Cyan Spirit race, so they all hid in their caves and refused to come out.</p>

  <p>However, just as they heard the man's intentions towards them, their expressions changed considerably.</p>

  <p>"We have never even provoked him. Why does he want to annihilate us?"</p>

  <p>"In a situation like this, we don't have much choice but to fend for our lives!"</p>

  <p>"He might not be that strong since he just entered the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>We can all work together to attack him. Maybe he won't be able to handle all of us at once and will eventually die of exhaustion."</p>

  <p>These nonhuman creatures used their own languages to communicate among themselves.</p>

  <p>One by one, the enchanted barriers of the caves were removed, and the nonhuman creatures big or small, powerful or weak, all emerged from their caves in what seemed like a swarm and dashed towards the man.</p>

  <p>Some of these creatures were large in terms of size and they looked strong.</p>

  <p>And some of them had tiny bodies covered with deadly toxins...</p>

  <p>Like moths to a flame, a mass of diverse nonhuman creatures from different races headed towards the man.</p>

  <p>Still with his foot on the leader's chest, the man applied pressure onto it to hear his groans and said, "You ask why? Hahaha... Because those who don't belong to our kin cannot be trusted."</p>

  <p>Just as he finished his words, he turned his head to find the overwhelming numbers of the nonhuman creatures headed his way. He showed no fear, and the ends of his lips curved into a smirk as streams of crescent-shaped energy gathered around him.</p>

  <p>He had grown up from killing and slaughtering.</p>

  <p>The reason he told the leader was only a ruse to draw out angry nonhuman creatures to him.</p>

  <p>Back then, the number of people he had killed in contrast to the nonhuman creatures was over ten times more. After annihilating all the prodigies of one continent, he would move to another, and he would not end his kill streak till he was the only one left in the world.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As three bright balls of light flashed, the sounds they produced with every explosion were deafening.</p>

  <p>The energy emitted from the man's body was unique, and the creatures in the entire Nether Mountain failed to recognize its origins. They figured the energy was from a distinctive Other Shore Token he might have obtained, but in fact, he had never used any.</p>

  <p>The intense shockwaves produced by the energy were so compelling that they destroyed the creatures who came in contact with them.</p>

  <p>Piles of broken limbs were scattered across the ground as the creatures fell one by one.</p>

  <p>In one round of slaughter, the man had destroyed the top-ranked warriors of the thirty-three caves without a hitch.</p>

  <p>The leader remained curled up on the ground watching the man who was floating in the sky. His eyes trembled in terror as he saw the man brutally kill off the nonhuman creatures without any hesitation on his face. Instead, he seemed to enjoy it.</p>

  <p>The leader had heard the powerful orthodox human forces would recruit some rare geniuses. But witnessing the man's strength in person, he realized no genius from any world would be able to defeat the monster in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Attack me! Hahaha!" the man roared, with his arms splayed out to them to invite them to attack him. The nonhuman creatures of the thirty-three caves felt the powerful force he unleashed and fell into despair. Many of them began to retreat.</p>

  <p>But he had no plans of letting them go.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, huge clouds of crescent-shaped energy rose beside him at his command and charged towards the nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>At the same time...</p>

  <p>A big black ship hovered over in the sky of the Square Captivity Province.</p>

  <p>The ship looked creaky and old, and emitted a heavy death aura. It looked as if a ghost was floating along the sky with a tattered appearance.</p>

  <p>What was more terrifying was its interior. The railings of the ship were decorated with skulls and bones of human race, Jin Wu, and even some were of Snake Goddess race, Heavenly Joy race and Flame race!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the owners of these bones had all gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement before they died, and they were all powerful masters of their respective races.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>A pale hand appeared from the ship that knocked down a human skull from the railing.</p>

  <p>The hand belonged to a beautiful woman dressed in a long black gown.</p>

  <p>Albeit her charming profile, she seemed lifeless. If she stood motionless, anyone would mistake her for a corpse.</p>

  <p>Stepping forward, she grabbed the human skull and brought it close to her nose to take a whiff of it. Wisps of green mist emanated from the eyes of the skull and went straight into her nose and mouth.</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of bones on the ship. Why did you choose that skull?" A voice echoed from behind her.</p>

  <p>The owner of that voice was covered in black silk threads, so it was hard to make out the person's face. However, the person was as thin and tall as a bamboo pole.</p>

  <p>"After all... he was my lover who had been with me for one hundred thousand years. He tastes good actually," the woman in long dress said with a tantalizing smile and continued to suck the energy from the skull. An intoxicated expression was plastered across her face.</p>

  <p>"You're such a freak!" the "bamboo pole" grumbled in an appalled voice.</p>

  <p>As they were immersed in conversation, they sensed a deep fluctuation in space from beneath the ship.</p>

  <p>Even though it was thousands of miles away, they could still feel the impact of it on the ghost-like ship.</p>

  <p>The woman in the black dress tilted her head to one side curiously. In doubt, she narrowed her eyes, and looked downwards where she felt the strong surge of energy. The "bamboo pole" felt it too.</p>

  <p>"Is this Ways-blending Energy?" the woman in the black dress asked as she turned to her companion.</p>

  <p>"It is, no doubt about it. And the warrior has twelve layers of Ways-blending Energy. This Ways-blending Energy seems to be perfect," said the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>"There is actually someone who cultivates Ways-blending Energy these days. Now I'm curious to know who this warrior is... Shall I go down there to have a look?" the woman in the black dress asked.</p>

  <p>"Do as you please." The "bamboo pole" shook his head indifferently. "But don't cause trouble to delay the captain's business."</p>

  <p>At his approval, the woman flapped her black dress behind her as she turned to descend to the ground. She emitted strong death aura high in the sky and fell straight towards the Nether Mountain like a comet falling out of the sky that would bring death to any being that came in contact with it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the foot of the Nether Mountain had become a cemetery of blood and limbs that scattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>The only race in the thirty-three caves that had survived was the human race.</p>

  <p>"Nether Mountain has beautiful scenery, and it's a good place for cultivation. I've killed all the other races. If you submit to me, I'll forgive you, spare your lives and protect you," the horrible man said dominantly to the leader of the Nineteenth Cave Humans.</p>

  <p>'Forgive us? What crimes have we committed to ask for your forgiveness?'</p>

  <p>The leader suppressed his thoughts in his mind and didn't dare to say them out loud. With the man's current temperament, the slightest of things could trigger him, and he would kill him immediately.</p>

  <p>As the leader nodded desperately, a heavy death aura emanated above their heads.</p>

  <p>The flesh and broken limbs on the ground seemed to have regained vitality the moment they were touched by the death aura.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>Blood began to flow into the broken limbs splayed out on the ground.</p>

  <p>Various ranges of blood from red, black, blue all followed suit as they came back to life.</p>

  <p>Countless broken limbs began to connect with the others. Among them were heads, arms, mouthparts, bones, so on and so forth.</p>

  <p>As they continued to combine, they turned into a huge monster.</p>

  <p>This monster's appearance was ghastly and hostile. One glance at it would make one want to throw up.</p>

  <p>As the vicious monster got up to stand on its two feet, a stunning woman in a black dress quietly appeared on top of its head.</p>
