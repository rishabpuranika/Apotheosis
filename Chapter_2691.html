  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily knew her current ability. It was just a piece of cake for her to find the target following the spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>The moment she disappeared, she had already identified where the spiritual sense came from.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hamlin had discovered Emily and the others outside the divine land along his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>After locating their presence, he felt a wave of space above his head.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>"What a quick response." Hamlin was absolutely shocked.</p>

  <p>Emily suddenly appeared as she stood upright in midair. She looked down at Hamlin, and sneered, "You are a so-called Holy Being, right?"</p>

  <p>She was obviously not being haughty towards him.</p>

  <p>But the aura emanated from her body still made Hamlin under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>He felt that the pressure was much stronger than that of Hamish.</p>

  <p>Ordinary True Gods would simply think Emily was extraordinary, but Hamlin, as a Holy Being, was keenly aware that he couldn't afford to offend her.</p>

  <p>"My name is Hamlin Zhao," he respectfully introduced himself. Both his hands were cupped, making him look rather humble.</p>

  <p>He kept telling himself in his heart not to annoy the woman in front of him.</p>

  <p>Emily glanced at him coldly. With a flick of her finger, a colorful ring enveloped Hamlin.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Hamlin felt that the space around him was locked, as he was dragged into a space channel.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the green star at the top of the Murphy Universe, Hamlin's companions had sensed something different.</p>

  <p>Nicholas and Murphy looked extremely cautious. Through their souls on Hamlin, they sensed Emily's action.</p>

  <p>"Master Hamish, do you know this woman?" Nicholas asked.</p>

  <p>Both of them felt the same aura since their souls had been attached to Hamlin. The pressure given by Emily was too much!</p>

  <p>"I don't know her," Hamish uttered, shaking his head. At this situation, he also felt very cautious. He, who was known to be an expert at the Other Shore Realm, felt burdened. "But this woman is very powerful."</p>

  <p>The faces of Nicholas and Murphy immediately darkened as soon as they heard Hamish's comment.</p>

  <p>"How strong is she?" Nicholas asked once more. He was not reconciled.</p>

  <p>"Even you are no match for her?"</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Hamish's face. "Both of us are at the Other Shore Realm, but there is a huge gap in strength between us. That woman is obviously a top-level figure at the Other Shore Realm. As for me..." Hamish shook his head affirmatively. "I am far from being her match!"</p>

  <p>Such a revelation far exceeded their expectations. The two looked at each other, and both had found surprise apparent in their eyes.</p>

  <p>As they were immersed in a discussion, Emily had already dragged Hamlin out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>Nicholas and the other two once again felt that something happened and couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p>

  <p>They were surprised to see that more than ten strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm appeared.</p>

  <p>A look of horror immediately spread across their faces. All of these warriors had an imposing manner and were not much weaker than Emily.</p>

  <p>Timotheus sat on the ground and looked straight at Hamlin. "Tell me, why did you use your spiritual sense to spy on us?"</p>

  <p>Standing among the crowd of warriors at the Other Shore Realm, Hamlin tried to calm himself down as he answered, "I didn't spy on you."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Timotheus, Emily and the others looked at each other and smiled lightly.</p>

  <p>"As a True God, you can't lie to me. You're overestimating yourself,"</p>

  <p>Emily stated. She walked slowly towards Hamlin. As she was close to him, her fingers slowly fell on his forehead. A cold sensation soon came into his mind.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Emily, Holy Beings who had their own universes were indeed much more powerful than consummate True Gods, but they were weaker than her.</p>

  <p>Hamlin was a Holy Being but he found out that he was still too weak to resist.</p>

  <p>As the colorful light on Emily's fingertips flashed, she gently pulled back. Three palm-sized colorful rings gradually floated in the air, in which there were three souls.</p>

  <p>She had actually forcefully extracted the souls of Hamish, Nicholas and Murphy.</p>

  <p>"Two Holy Beings, and one at the Other Shore Realm. You three are the people behind him. Am I right?" Emily lightly spoke to the three souls.</p>

  <p>The three souls then began to change.</p>

  <p>The soul in the front quickly turned into the appearance of Hamish. He made a fist salute and greeted politely, "You must come from the Source World, right? Sorry, I didn't come out to greet you. It's my fault."</p>

  <p>"Sorry? You just sent a scapegoat because you didn't dare to come out,"</p>

  <p>Emily spat in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Emily and Timotheus could clearly see through such a little trick at a glance.</p>

  <p>Hamish admitted frankly, "I had no choice. I'm not powerful enough. I was afraid I'd be killed, so I had to be cautious. Please forgive me. But...</p>

  <p>What brings you here?"</p>

  <p>Hamish, at the moment, still held a glimmer of hope in his heart. He was hoping that these people were not his enemies.</p>

  <p>"What brings us here?" Emily had a faint smile on her face as she said,</p>

  <p>"Of course, we come to help Luo Zheng and eliminate all his enemies. I think you should be on his list too? Otherwise, you wouldn't have appeared in front of us furtively and inquired about our stand."</p>

  <p>The hearts of Hamish, Nicholas and Murphy sank all of a sudden at Emily's words.</p>

  <p>This was probably the last thing they wanted to hear.</p>

  <p>Back in the Murphy Universe, Murphy spoke with a bitter smile, "Luo Zheng is so lucky to have so many powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm to help him."</p>

  <p>Nicholas sighed as he took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, at the time in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, had the chance to kill Luo Zheng. However, he had personally ordered Troy to stop her.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that his own order would bring such a huge hidden trouble. It was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>Hamish thought for a moment. He continued to control his soul, and made an offer. "We can give all that Luo Zheng can give to you, including the entire divine land. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The divine land contained Chiyou's painstaking efforts, and its own value was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The exiles at the bottom of the chaos had also made countless plans to lay their hands on the divine land. Because of Emily, they could only give up on this idea.</p>

  <p>"Give me the divine land?" Emily was slightly stunned, and then looked at Timotheus with a meaningful smile.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Ramzi, Leopold of the Nine Li race burst into laughter. Their laughter gave Hamlin the creeps and made the three figures back in the Murphy Universe feel guilty.</p>

  <p>Timotheus stood up. In the face of Hamish's soul, his eyes were filled with killing intent. He rebuked, "You're just an unknown Yellow Emperor Guard. How dare you hand over the divine land? Do you think that the divine land belongs to you as you live in it? Do you even know who built the divine land?"</p>
