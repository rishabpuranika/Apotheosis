<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Cloud Hall? What happened to Cloud Hall?" Yudie's eyes widened as she asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll know when we get out," said Luo Zheng as he turned around and walked towards the entrance of the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie turned to look at Xun, but Xun gave her a meaningful stare in return. It seemed like the two easily understood what each other's look meant.</p>

  <p>Xun then turned back into a sword spirit and merged into Zheng's body. Like a baby, she huddled herself inside him, her face full of disappointment.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon noticed this. Stealthily communicating with her, he asked, "Little girl, why the long face? What is bothering you?"</p>

  <p>Xun replied coldly, "Stop talking to me!"</p>

  <p>With that, the cyan dragon could only let out an awkward smile. The red dragon, on the other hand, laughed out loud and said, "I guess our little girl has something on her mind."</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'little girl'. You two may be dragons, but you're not in any way older than me!" Xun once again replied coldly.</p>

  <p>She was almost a world lord in the Upper World. Moreover, as a queen of Demon Night, she was also the spirit totem of the race. Given her seniority, she understandably looked down upon the old dragons in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>As she knew what happened in the Genuine Dragon World, she knew everything about the origins of the nine dragons. They lived in Zheng's mind, while she was Zheng's sword spirit. All of them relied on Luo Zheng and never really offended each other.</p>

  <p>But since Xun was in a bad mood right now, she couldn't help but be a bit rude to them.</p>

  <p>"Warriors don't use time to measure age. That's just what mortals would do. Now you're acting like a willful girl," the red dragon continued, as he curled his lips.</p>

  <p>At this, Xun decided to just close her eyes and not speak. Her feeling was still running high, and she didn't want to cause any more commotion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not aware of what was happening in his body. There were many things in it, and they were making his body crowded. In addition to the nine dragons and Xun, the black fire in the mysterious furnace also lived there. It also had its own consciousness, but it didn't have high intelligence.</p>

  <p>Morphens and the two other Virtual Tribulation Realm elders were still waiting outside the Ice Palace. The scene before them had visibly frightened them.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Ning Yudie was alright, and it was enough to relieve them. As for the relationship between Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng, there was no need for them to guess or ask. They just pretended that they didn't see what had happened.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that Ning Yudie didn't know that Morphens and the rest had already entered, because if she did, she would definitely feel burdened.</p>

  <p>After she walked out of the Ice Palace, she glanced at Morphens and said with urgency in her voice, "Morphens, Luo Zheng said that something happened in the Cloud Hall when I was trying to break through to the Life and Death Realm. What was it? Was it serious?"</p>

  <p>Morphens quickly came over, bowed and said, "Master Ning, when you went through the closed door cultivation in order to break through to the Life and Death Realm a few days ago, Emanuel led warriors from Zhuo, Fei, Shen and other clans to rebel."</p>

  <p>"What?" Yudie's expression changed. She never expected that anyone would stage a rebellion while she was trying to break through to the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>But then, she had long known that Emanuel had not been convinced and had been brooding over the fact that she had become the leader of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Such a thing had never happened in the history of Cloud Hall. But it had to be said - Ning Yudie was indeed too simple-minded and inexperienced to be the leader of Cloud Hall. Other leaders of Cloud Hall wouldn't choose to break through to the Life and Death Realm at this time.</p>

  <p>"But don't worry, Master Ning. The rebellion has already been pacified.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was personally killed by Luo Zheng, and the rest of the rebels have been captured," Morphens replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Ning Yudie took a deep breath, and her expression gradually changed into something colder. "It seems like those third-grade clans are still not convinced. Well, I will let them know who the leader of Cloud Hall is!"</p>

  <p>Before long, Cloud Hall began to fly towards the direction of Cloudy City. Cloud Hall had always flown above Cloudy City, and only when there were some major events would they leave temporarily.</p>

  <p>In the city, many warriors from the third-grade clans were looking forward to their return.</p>

  <p>The rebellion Emanuel led was deeply supported by many third-grade clans as the fact that Ning Yudie was now the leader of the Cloud Hall disappointed them very much.</p>

  <p>The position Ning Yudie was now holding originally belonged to someone from their clans. But now, it had fallen into the hands of someone with another surname, not to mention a little girl at that. How could these third-grade clans possibly take this lying down?</p>

  <p>Just as Emanuel proposed to rebel, he quickly obtained the support of all the other third-grade clans. The master of the Fei Clan personally took part in the rebellion, but he was killed by Tianming with his sword strike.</p>

  <p>But what happened in Cloud Hall did not necessarily spread to Cloudy City. After Cloud Hall left the city, any kind of relevant news was completely sealed off. In order to prevent any problems, after Emanuel opened the enchanted barrier, no martial artists were allowed to enter or leave.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the news that the master of the Fei Clan died and that Emanuel was killed by Luo Zheng after he failed staging a rebellion had yet to spread from Cloud Hall to the city, and so many clans in the city were still unaware of what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Look! Cloud Hall is back!" a warrior from the Zhuo Clan exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It seems like Emanuel has succeeded. But that bitch Ning Yudie should have already been executed, right?"</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was a warrior from the Fei Clan. He smacked his lips and continued, "What a pity. What a waste for such a beautiful lady to die just like that!"</p>

  <p>But the master of the Shen Clan looked worried. Looking up, he said,</p>

  <p>"But the two stewards of the Cloud School reported back that Luo Zheng had visited the Cloud Hall a few days ago. Has Luo Zheng really returned?"</p>

  <p>"Hmph, Luo Zheng? Even if he returns, he might not even be able to enter Cloud Hall! Remember the sect-protecting array? It..." The master of the Shen Clan interrupted the speaker in the middle of his sentence, "But that was set up by Luo Zheng himself, so he must have a way to break through it!"</p>

  <p>Then, the master of the Wu Clan spoke up, "And so what if he can break it? Emanuel led so many strong warriors of the Virtual Tribulation Realm there. How can a young man like Luo Zheng be able to contend against them?"</p>

  <p>But the master of the Shen Clan shook his head and said, "I'm just a little worried. I have a bad feeling about this."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. After our clan takes control of Cloud Hall, all of you will be able to share our success!" a warrior from the Zhuo Clan said proudly.</p>

  <p>Once Emanuel succeeded, the Zhuo Clan would definitely be the biggest beneficiary.</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, Cloud Hall was already floating in the air above the city.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall, which had disappeared for a long time, had once again returned. Because of this, many mortals decided to walk out of their houses and raised their heads to the sky to watch it.</p>

  <p>Even though these mortals lived in the city and there were countless warriors around them, they didn't show much concern for the disputes, wars and killings that were happening in the world of warriors. In their eyes, Cloud Hall was aloof and exalted. Those who were able to enter Cloud Hall were all deities who had been reborn and were worth everyone's worship. Also, Cloud Hall itself, as a divine place, was the most beautiful scenery in Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>"Let's go up and meet them!" a warrior from the Fei Clan said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"But where is Emanuel? Don't tell me that he is too lazy to show up now that he has become the master of Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A dozen figures flew towards the Cloud Hall. However, they suddenly felt a strong cold air envelop them halfway through their journey.</p>

  <p>The cold air contained waves of killing intent that made their hearts palpitate. Fear suddenly was like sharp claws that grasped onto their hearts.</p>

  <p>Even the dull mortals could feel a great power radiating from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>On the edge of Cloud Hall, there was an independent platform, which extended through a stone pillar that was several feet wide. Ning Yudie was standing on top of the platform. She was wearing a suit of armor made of mysterious ice which had the long feathers of the ice phoenix that were about thirty feet long. They hung down from her back to the bottom of the platform, swaying non-stop in the air, while her straight and well-proportioned legs were pressed together.</p>

  <p>She looked coldly down at Cloudy City. At the same time, she released her Mu Ning, which was as cold as that of any male warrior.</p>

  <p>"This is the Mu Ning of a Life and Death Realm warrior!"</p>

  <p>"It's Yudie's Mu Ning. She has succeeded in breaking through to the Life and Death Realm!"</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Did Emanuel fail? Or did he not make a move?"</p>

  <p>To everyone, it was very clear that Emanuel had failed, since Ning Yudie was still standing on top of Cloud Hall. Despite that, they still held on to a sliver of hope in their hearts that Emanuel hadn't made his move yet. It was this self-deceiving feeling that would arise every time someone was in the face of danger.</p>
