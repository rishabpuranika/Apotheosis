<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Do you know how we can deal with the thunderbolts?" Fuxi asked as he pointed at the distance.</p>

  <p>Right as he pointed, a huge thunderbolt fell from the sky and hit the plain below.</p>

  <p>After endless hits from the thunderbolts, the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain was charred to a crisp.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng raised his hand and a faint, purple glow radiated from his palm. The purple light grew more and more intense; it was the Imprisoning Lightning.</p>

  <p>"The Primeval Lord of Heaven of the human race once led all the human elites across the Heavenly Thunder Plain just by relying on this Imprisoning Lightning!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng floated forward and landed right in the center of the Heavenly Thunder Plain.</p>

  <p>The surface of the Heavenly Thunder Plain was very flat, so anything above its horizon was struck by lightning. Once Luo Zheng's toes touched the ground, he quickly attracted the thunder.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a thunder dragon descended and headed straight for Luo Zheng's right hand.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's right hand flashed fiercely with the purple Imprisoning Lightning. The moment the dragon came into contact with his palm, it disintegrated into brown ashes and scattered under Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's eyes widened and their jaws dropped. This was the first time they had ever witnessed this.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the light solidified the thunderbolt, right?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>As she was extremely sensitive to energy, she could sense it even if it happened within a second.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as he carefully collected the Solid Lightning Powder and handed it to the Snake Goddess. "This is the Solid Lightning Powder. After the Primeval Lord of Heaven had accumulated enough Solid Lightning Powder, he used it to kill the Divine Retribution Beast."</p>

  <p>"The Divine Retribution Beast..."</p>

  <p>"The human race killed a Divine Retribution Beast?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess couldn't help but gasp in shock.</p>

  <p>Although they knew the human race was strong in the past and could even resist the Element Spirit Civilization, they did not expect that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had once killed the Divine Retribution Beast.</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess examined the Solid Lightning Powder in her hands, curiosity filled her thoughts. Suddenly, a shadow of Snake Goddess silently drilled into the Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>A streak of lightning flashed in her cupped hands.</p>

  <p>"Woof, woof, woof!" the Augury Dog behind Fuxi barked ferociously at the sight of the lightning.</p>

  <p>"Toss it out!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess was already prepared for any mishaps. With a slight shake of her hand, she threw out the Solid Lightning Powder as if nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>In the same moment, a round thunder ball around the size of a water tank bloomed and emitted a blinding light before them. The lightning lasted for a while until it gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes twitched as he felt the formidable power.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Goddess was a second slower, half of her body would have been burnt to a crisp.</p>

  <p>A handful of Solid Lightning Powder was already so powerful. What would happen if they accumulated more than this?</p>

  <p>And now, they could not only easily cross the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but also accumulate enough such powder. Soon enough, the three of them set off for the depths of the Heavenly Thunder Plain.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Only a handful of thunderbolts were on the edge of the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but the closer they got to the depths of the plain, the denser the thunderbolts became. As they moved for another hundred miles, the thunderbolts in the sky eventually became a thick thunder curtain.</p>

  <p>Any creature sucked into the thunder curtain would be turned into ashes just by the thunderbolts.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng raised his right hand and emitted the strong Imprisoning Lightning for their protection.</p>

  <p>Any thunderbolt that came close to them, no matter how thick or thin, turned into dust. Meanwhile, Fuxi collected the powder for future use.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, were you able to absorb all the thunderbolts in the Heavenly Thunder Plain before? How did you make it?" Luo Zheng asked politely. He walked casually as he held out the Imprisoning Lightning in his hand, making the thunderbolts into powder each time they struck.</p>

  <p>"If my real body came here, the Imprisoning Lightning released could illuminate the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain," the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded with a humble smile.</p>

  <p>"Illuminating the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain..." Luo Zheng took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was a powerful warrior and was not one to be underestimated. He possessed the same level of power as the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>After traveling for another six or seven miles, the three eventually arrived at the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. The thunderbolts fell to the ground like rainwater. It was a terrifying sight.</p>

  <p>Their safe place was under the Imprisoning Lightning Luo Zheng had released. No matter how many thunderbolts struck, they were turned into Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>After all, the Imprisoning Lightning was not the enemy of the thunder. It could just alter the thunderbolts into another form.</p>

  <p>As Fuxi concentrated on gathering the Solid Lightning Powder, the Augury Dog beside him barked.</p>

  <p>Though the creature was frightened by the Heavenly Thunder Plain, he was calm under the protection of the Imprisoning Lightning. His barks only meant that he sensed something else.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi looked to the direction the Augury Dog barked in. There seemed to be nothing there.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Fuxi asked the Augury Dog.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog lay prostrate on the ground vigilantly. "I don't know. It seems that something dangerous is approaching..."</p>

  <p>"Even the Other Shore creatures of the Grand Pure Realm can't survive here. You're probably just sensitive with all these thunderbolts," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Augury Dog's eyes still squinted at the direction as he sensed something odd.</p>

  <p>They continued their journey for another three or four miles and they were about to go through the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. However, the Augury Dog suddenly dropped to the ground again and whimpered in fear.</p>

  <p>The last time when the Augury Dog was this frightened, there had been danger right around the corner.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" As soon as Fuxi asked, a door suddenly appeared a few feet away and two long-haired monsters stormed out from the door!</p>

  <p>The two hairy monsters growled and rushed towards the three of them.</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts fell like an unending storm and hit the bodies of the beasts. It seemed that their fur protected them from all kinds of thunderbolts.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was still busy collecting the Solid Lightning Powder when he caught sight of the two monsters. The long-haired monsters grabbed him, about to drag him into the flashes of lightning.</p>

  <p>The intentions of the monsters were not their only worry now. The thunderbolts in the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain were already powerful enough that Fuxi wouldn't last half a minute there.</p>

  <p>The moment Fuxi's arms were pulled out of the range of the Imprisoning Lightning, his hair was even singed by the lightning!</p>

  <p>Seeing that Fuxi was about to be dragged out, the Snake Goddess and Luo Zheng grabbed Fuxi by his arms to drag him back into the range of the Imprisoning Lightning.</p>

  <p>Fuxi resembled a rope in a tug-of-war, being pulled on both ends.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was not that strong, while Luo Zheng's power was not like it used to be. With their combined efforts, Fuxi was motionless like a pillar.</p>

  <p>The two monsters also seemed surprised. Their intention was only to take one person and inquire about the situation of the Grand Pure Realm, but none among the three were weaker than them.</p>

  <p>Here, Fuxi suffered great pain. His bones were crushed, especially his backbone which was nearly broken. If the strength continuously increased, he'd be torn into two pieces.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Augury Dog pounced and emitted a faint bronze light from his mouth. He roared fiercely right at the two long-haired monsters!</p>

  <p>For some reason, the two long-haired monsters were extremely afraid of the Augury Dog's roar. When they heard the dog's barks, they quickly threw their hands up and retreated into the door.</p>

  <p>The moment the door was shut, the door disappeared.</p>
