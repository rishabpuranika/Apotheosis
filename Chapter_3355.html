<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman dressed in white was Lady Jean. She enjoyed a high position in the Phoenix Palace and was not shy about showing it.</p>

  <p>When Chance was in the middle of a battle at the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, some maids saw it and immediately rushed off to tell Jean what was going on.</p>

  <p>She rushed over, infuriated to see her son being beaten by two Regal Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>The guards saw Jean, exchanged a quick look and quietly slid away.</p>

  <p>Other concubines could be reasoned with and spoken to easily, but Jean was cold and loved to let her anger out on others around her.</p>

  <p>The guards had looked on when Chance was being beaten by the Regal Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>They were too weak to stop it, but if Jean were to turn to them in anger and ask questions, they'd have no way of defending themselves, and so they opted to run away from the situation.</p>

  <p>Hearing Jean's words, Zheng was helpless.</p>

  <p>Like mother, like son. Chance and his mother were very much alike in character. Jean didn't even know what was going on and had immediately decided to criticize and blame Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your son and I are sparring with each other. Why are you making such a fuss?" Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>"Mother, he crumbled my sword right when he got here. Obviously he is here to cause trouble. Punish him!" Ahmad said whining.</p>

  <p>Jean looked daggers at Zheng and said, "As I said, you're acting wildly and atrociously. There's no way for you to deny it!"</p>

  <p>She snorted in derision as pieces of ice crystals floated from her fingertips towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The crystals were so icy cold that they would have shattered the jade statues into a million pieces if they so much as touched them.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants all bubbled with excitement on seeing the ice crystals flying at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most of them were proud and arrogant, always looking down upon the disciples outside of the Phoenix Palace. This attributed to the fact they all shared a bit of the blood of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Zheng had beaten Chance in their territory and this was unacceptable to them.</p>

  <p>They had taken it as not only a defeat to Chance, but to all the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>This feeling writhing in their hearts, they watched eagerly in hope Zheng would swiftly meet his demise.</p>

  <p>Of course, Jean's cultivation base was higher than Chance's. Killing Zheng would be a piece of cake for her.</p>

  <p>Chance and Ahmad looked at Zheng as a dead man walking. He was about to die and didn't even know it. Not a trace of fear appeared on his face. 'What an idiot!' thought Chance.</p>

  <p>But the brothers soon changed their tone.</p>

  <p>Not only did Zheng show no fear, a smile now shaped his lips.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Watch out for the ice crystals!"</p>

  <p>Xun, Nelly, and Liusu warned him, filled with angst.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected Jean to appear once Zheng had won.</p>

  <p>They had met her once before. Liusu had trouble controlling the Sprite Fire and set fire to the Phoenix Palace. Jean happened to pass by and put the fire out.</p>

  <p>She wanted to teach Liusu a violent lesson but Flamine had stopped her.</p>

  <p>From then on, Xun, Nelly and Liusu knew Jean was a tough one, but they didn't expect her to take Zheng's life on her first attack!</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't flinch at the ice crystals floating in front of him. Instead, he slowly stretched his fingertips out towards the crystals.</p>

  <p>The ice crystals with a deadly cold aura flew away, disappearing as if they had never even existed.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Ahmad, Chance and the other direct descendants were all shocked.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng could defeat Chance who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, how could he deflate Jean's theurgy so easily?</p>

  <p>The ice crystals might have looked ordinary but they were definitely not something Zheng could withstand.</p>

  <p>Jean remained stone cold and unflinching. "Lady Flamine, you're already here. Why are you hiding?" she said coldly.</p>

  <p>A figure in cerise materialized silently next to Zheng. There was a faint smile on Flamine's face as she said, "I gave Zheng a token to enter, so he may walk freely in the Phoenix Palace. He's not making trouble here."</p>

  <p>"He broke Ahmad's sword and hurt Chance. Don't you think that's a bit far for a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Jean's eyes burned with anger.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of Flamine, she wouldn't yield an inch.</p>

  <p>Just then, Nelly came to Zheng's side frowning and said, "Ahmad wanted to drive us away from the Phoenix Palace and almost killed Xun. If not for Zheng, he would have! Chance is even worse; even though he's a powerful warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, he still fought Zheng. Then you showed up acting like this after Zheng had defeated them both. Aren't you ashamed?"</p>

  <p>"Like mother, like son. They have no sense of shame," Liusu added.</p>

  <p>Xun narrowed her eyes and with an air of caution, moved quietly beside Zheng, snorted and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Being jeered by Nelly and Liusu only infuriated Jean more.</p>

  <p>She was a high-ranking figure here. How dare they speak to her this way?</p>

  <p>"Shut your mouth! You are asking for death to come calling!" Jean clenched her fists. Ice crystals began appearing above them, quickly turning into a snowstorm sweeping straight towards Zheng and his women.</p>

  <p>The ice crystals she cast could freeze a space forever. If a person was covered with her ice crystals, they were as good as dead.</p>

  <p>The fierce snowstorm was about to engulf them when Flamine raised her hands and layers of golden flames spurt out and fluttered through the air.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With a flick of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, the snowstorm had dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Lady Jean, that's enough. Please go back to your place and rest," said Flamine.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine! Are you really going to protect these lowly outsiders?" Jean snapped. Her pretty face twisted in anger.</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace might have seemed peaceful and serene, but the concubines were always in disagreements with one another.</p>

  <p>Jean and Flamine had never been on good terms. And now, Ahmad and Chance were beat and Flamine sided with the outsiders? Jean could not make sense of this.</p>

  <p>"Lowly outsiders?" A smile of mockery crossed Flamine's face. "Firstly, they are the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, not lowly outsiders.</p>

  <p>Secondly, they are friends of my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Friends?" Jean smiled disdainfully and was about to respond, but Flamine interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Thirdly, compared to us, Zheng is much more important to the Oneness Sky Palace!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only one capable of deciphering the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Based on that, Zheng was indeed more important to the Oneness Sky Palace than the concubines of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Jean's heart skipped a beat at Flamine's words. Zheng? More important than them?</p>

  <p>What made him so important?</p>

  <p>This was a hard pill to swallow and she thought Flamine was probably lying to her anyway.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you say. I won't let this matter go to rest unless you hand them over!" Jean said coldly.</p>

  <p>"So you want to fight me?" asked Flamine with a menacing smile.</p>
