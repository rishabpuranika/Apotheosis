<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3231 Purpose </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan was one of the two large clans of the Bearing race. The Soul Rings that Deon practiced were tough indeed.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his Soul Rings, he was able to do as he pleased on Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't stop Milo from trying. He shot out his Mind Sword, slashing through the three Soul Rings on the outer layer.</p>

  <p>Deon's face fell.</p>

  <p>Seamus had warned him not to underestimate Milo, yet he was still surprised.</p>

  <p>Deon was ranked part of the top ten among the younger generation of the Ji Clan. He had inherited some of the unique skills of the clan. The audiences were stunned. Would he be defeated in one strike?</p>

  <p>With a snarl, he reactivated his soul force, summoning more Soul Rings to spread out and protect him.</p>

  <p>When Milo's second Mind Sword attacked him again, he leapt to the side, dodging the blade by a hair.</p>

  <p>Milo still remained calm.</p>

  <p>Since he had mastered the Truth Enlightenment, he was confident in the power of the Heart Slaughtering Strike.</p>

  <p>With this power, he might even be able to kill a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Of course, this would only be possible if the warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm had just cultivated their soul to the Indigo Soul level. After all, after one had the Indigo Soul, they could improve further with enough soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>An idea flashed through his mind and the invisible Mind Sword began to hover in the air. With a slight smile, he controlled the sword to slash at Deon again.</p>

  <p>Deon didn't dare face him head on, and he swiveled to the side to dodge the slash. Moving as flexibly as a snake, he pounced from side to side, narrowly dodging Milo's strikes.</p>

  <p>However, the space of the Soul Arena was limited. After several dodges, he was trapped in a corner. Milo slowly headed towards him, taking his sweet time.</p>

  <p>Milo continued slashing at him with his invisible Mind Sword, his eyes flashing in anticipation. Finally, all the Soul Rings were shattered into thousands of pieces. Milo pointed his sword at Deon's soul. Deon immediately raised his hand in surrender.</p>

  <p>Milo knew when to stop. Withdrawing his Mind Sword, he walked away from the trembling Deon.</p>

  <p>"Milo is truly amazing," Dorothy praised, nodding in approval.</p>

  <p>Although her Soul of Light had improved a lot, she knew that if she were to fight Deon in the Soul Arena, it wouldn't be so easy for her to win.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Somehow, even though Milo's soul strength was nowhere near as strong as Deon, he had managed to destroy him without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>If Milo's soul succeeded in turning into an Indigo Soul, his power would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Zheng was deep in thought. From the way Milo ended the fight, it didn't look like he was a bloodthirsty killer, killing for killings' sake. The second Deon admitted defeat, he stopped his attacks. So why did Seamus claim that Milo almost killed his younger brother?</p>

  <p>Zheng's thoughts were interrupted as the crowd erupted into cheer.</p>

  <p>"Milo won the battle so easily!"</p>

  <p>"Is the fight over? I just got here!"</p>

  <p>"I heard that the Bearing race gambled soul crystal on this match..."</p>

  <p>Because of the news about Soul Snakes swarming the Oneness Sky Palace's temple, many of the elite disciples had come to the Other Shore to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>Just now, Deon had taken out the soul crystal, causing the audience to whisper amongst themselves excitedly. More and more disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace started showing up.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the disciples that had just come were only here for the soul crystal, and most of them were elites from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>After Deon's swift defeat, he left the Soul Arena dejectedly. The audience held their breath in anticipation, waiting for the next warrior to step onto the arena -- but no one came.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the Soul Arena, hands clasped behind his back, Milo grew impatient. "Seamus, you said you'd send three people to fight me. Where is the second one?"</p>

  <p>Milo saw Seamus whispering to his group under the stage. Suddenly, Seamus's once arrogant disposition changed into one of respect. "Please wait a while," he said courteously with a charismatic smile.</p>

  <p>As the clock ticked, the crowd grew restless in anticipation.</p>

  <p>"Are the Bearing race afraid now?"</p>

  <p>"Milo is really strong. The power of the Flow Strike is incredible!"</p>

  <p>"But Seamus wouldn't go back on his own words, would he?" "If he really flinches and backs out, that would be a huge disgrace. Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>People from the Oneness Sky Palace laughed amongst themselves, confident in Milo's abilities.</p>

  <p>However, the disciples from the Bearing race kept quiet; no one tried to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>After a while, Seamus finally spoke up, "Okay, I'm done making arrangements. Rex, it's your turn to face Milo."</p>

  <p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, a warrior from the Bearing race stepped onto the Soul Arena.</p>

  <p>And just like that, the second battle began. Rex Ji was a little stronger than Deon. No one knew what kind of soul theurgy he had cultivated, but every time Milo slashed at him with the Mind Sword, Rex flitted away with ease, as though he were as light as a feather.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed. This wasn't a fight; this was just a game of cat and mouse.</p>

  <p>It looked as though Rex Ji had no intention of attacking. He continued to tirelessly dodge Milo's strikes, darting around the arena like a graceful gazelle.</p>

  <p>"Are you here to fight me? Or are you just here to run away?" Milo asked impatiently, his nostrils flaring.</p>

  <p>Rex Ji seemed unbothered by Milo's taunts. He floated about the arena, indifferent to Milo's attacks. It seemed that he still didn't plan to seriously fight the battle.</p>

  <p>"Okay, fine."</p>

  <p>Milo raised his eyebrows, evidently exerting more effort now. The white truth aura spun more violently around him, the Mind Sword crashing down at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>As Milo attacked with all his strength, Rex Ji's expression changed to that of worry. Suddenly, his dodges were less graceful, until he was cornered, just like his predecessor. Throwing his hands up immediately, Rex Ji admitted defeat, too.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here." Milo waved his hand impatiently.</p>

  <p>He knitted his brows, wondering what trick Seamus was playing. How could he have sent a warrior to play hide and seek with him?</p>

  <p>"This is the last round. Are you going to send someone from your race, or will you fight me yourself?" Milo called out to Seamus.</p>

  <p>Seamus surveyed the Soul Arena. Multitudes of Souls of Light flashed purple around the arena. It seemed most of the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace had gathered there. A look of satisfaction crept on his face as he strode confidently to the center of the arena.</p>

  <p>"You dawdled for two hours!" Milo mocked. "Don't tell me you're going to go back on your words!" Milo crossed his arms over his chest to assert dominance.</p>

  <p>Seamus's face broke into an even wider smile. Anyway, people on the Other Shore couldn't see each other's expressions. He said, "Go back on my words? The petty soul crystal is nothing compared to the lives of more than half of the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace!" He threw his head back and laughed maniacally.</p>

  <p>Almost all the elite disciples on Stage Four had come to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Only a small part who were exploring on Stage Twelve and Stage Thirteen were still on the way here. But Seamus thought the number of warriors that had gathered here was enough.</p>

  <p>Milo's expression changed. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy and Zheng exchanged anxious glances.</p>

  <p>They felt that something was wrong from the beginning, and only now did they finally realize what was going on: it was all an elaborate trap! Seamus only wanted to gather the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace in one place and kill them off!</p>

  <p>Dorothy gasped. Was Seamus crazy?</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted as he grabbed Dorothy and flew backwards.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what tricks Seamus had under his sleeve, he didn't want to wait to find out. All the disciples who had come to watch were unprepared for an ambush. Anxious cries rose from the crowd.</p>

  <p>Seamus continued to laugh hysterically. He and his men had been plotting this for a long time; they were ready for any type of response.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Seamus raised his hands higher. Out of nowhere, Soul Binding Threads burst forth from the ground in a ten thousand-foot radius around the Soul Arena, coiling around the ankles of each and every Soul of Light present.</p>

  <p>While this didn't restrict their movement, they were tied to the Other Shore and could not leave there.</p>
