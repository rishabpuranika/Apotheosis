  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gant was baffled upon hearing Raphael's words.</p>

  <p>Here, many Su Clan members and Taiyi Guards heavily guarded the area by keeping their eyes and ears open.</p>

  <p>So what if he found Eira? He could barely say a word to her, let alone take her away.</p>

  <p>"After Eira was born, her parents died. I know she leads a miserable life and I feel sorry for her. But there's nothing I can do." Raphael let out a sigh and said, "You'd better leave first. Yesterday you survived the Jin Wu's attack in Blue Cloud City. You ought to get as much rest as you can."</p>

  <p>As Gant's father ascended to the position of the Su Clan master, he employed strict rules which demanded that all Su Clan members must prioritize the clan above all else with great sacrifice.</p>

  <p>However, the members were not in favor of Eira dying unless there was no other way. After all, she was born with the purest blood of the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>There was nothing left to do. Gant felt hopeless and couldn't accept that this was the fate that awaited Eira.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the door was flung open.</p>

  <p>Three people walked in.</p>

  <p>They were dressed in white clothing that was adorned with the patterns of flame and sword on its shoulders? they were from the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man led the group. His features included long eyebrows and big, brown eyes which he now used to glance around the room with a piercingly cold gaze.</p>

  <p>The three people were surprised to find out that they weren't alone in the room. As soon as the middle-aged man caught a glimpse of Raphael, he called out to him, "Raphael? What are you doing here? I thought you..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his words, the middle-aged man noticed Gant beside Raphael. His eyes were momentarily full of confusion before being replaced by the fierceness. He shouted, "Gant! What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was Cailen Su, Gant's father.</p>

  <p>Previously, Gant was frightened whenever he had to be around his father.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, he straightened his neck and exclaimed fearlessly,</p>

  <p>"I'm here to take Eira away! Father, there's no need for her to sacrifice her own life for the Su Clan."</p>

  <p>Gant had been at odds with his father ever since he decided to go to the Dragon City. Cailen Su had decided to take Gant home and subject him to strict discipline after successfully refining the Shade Stone. He never expected Gant to come to the Blue Cloud City and defy him once more.</p>

  <p>"Hmmm... So you believe she doesn't have to sacrifice herself for our clan?</p>

  <p>Need I remind you that the Su Clan has achieved the power it has now because of the sacrifices of thousands of Su Clan members? If there is no such a powerful clan to support you, who do you think you are? If so, I'm afraid you are even unable to enter the Dragon City!" Cailen Su uttered in a tone that would send chills down anyone's spine.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Su Clan managed to steadily increase its status in the Taiyi Heaven Palace thanks to the decisions and actions of Cailen Su.</p>

  <p>"Whether I can enter the city or not is none of your business. Today, I have to take Eira away!" Gant proclaimed loudly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! If you even think about taking her away, I make sure that you can never leave this city!" Cailen scolded.</p>

  <p>Gant squared his shoulders and walked straight towards Eira. He tried to cross the blood red array and draw her out.</p>

  <p>"You're asking for death!"</p>

  <p>Gant's two uncles, Ruben Su and Ableson Su who were on either side of Cailen Su, didn't move, while Cailen Su was furious.</p>

  <p>Being a weapon refiner, Cailen Su possessed a high cultivation base which helped strengthen his power. He was a powerful warrior in the seventh stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>With his arm stretched out, he began to try and slap some sense back into Gant. If his palm managed to make contact with his face, his son would be met with an attack equivalent to at least 30 Jun of force!</p>

  <p>The slap could potentially disable or even kill him!</p>

  <p>"Cailen!"</p>

  <p>Raphael called out as he hastily made his way in front to block Gant from the attack.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Raphael had poor weapon refining skills and his cultivation base was weaker than those of his brothers. He was easily slapped away by Cailen Su, taking in all the force that came with it.</p>

  <p>"Phew."</p>

  <p>Cailen Su raised his hand once more and rushed towards Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant ignored Cailen's action and decided then and there that he would accept whatever cruelty his father would throw at him? even if it meant death.</p>

  <p>Gently turning his hand, Luo Zheng summoned the energy of the demonic eye which started to gather in his palm.</p>

  <p>He quickly moved to Gant's side and pushed his arm forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's palm strike seemed to be slow but it was extremely fast in fact, as it blocked Cailen's attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's and Cailen's palms made contact, the resulting power was formidable.</p>

  <p>The force spread out from under their feet and shook the entire building violently.</p>

  <p>"It's normal for father and son to quarrel over family affairs. But this is going way too far," Luo Zheng pointed out slowly.</p>

  <p>Cailen's rage made him want to teach his son a hard lesson.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't expecting his attack to be blocked by the young man in front of him now. He was stunned.</p>

  <p>Gant's uncles shared the same baffled expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>They noticed that Luo Zheng's cultivation base was slightly weaker than Gant's.</p>

  <p>They presumed that he was just Gant's friend from the Dragon City that was just in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm. He was someone that no one would notice immediately.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was able to resist Cailen's attack with ease, which gave everyone an entirely new impression of him.</p>

  <p>Even a warrior in the third or fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm could never resist Cailen's palm strike easily like Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? This business concerning my family has nothing to do with you," Cailen Su iterated callously.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't fear Luo Zheng, Cailen Su decided not to underestimate Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew that, despite being only at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, this man was truly powerful and had a strong background.</p>

  <p>"Gant isn't just a member of the Su Clan," Luo Zheng uttered seriously. "He's part of my team too. As the Flag Master, it's my duty to protect him."</p>

  <p>After staring at Luo Zheng for quite some time, Cailen Su addressed him with a cold smile and said, "You're nothing but a Flag Master. And yet here you are trying to prevent us from refining the Shade Stone. No matter which clan you're a part of, you're asking for death!"</p>

  <p>With that, scorching power emitted from his body. He had summoned his Other Shore Token? the Demonic Fire Dragon Scale of Stage Seven.</p>

  <p>As the sweltering power dispersed, everyone felt as though their faces had suffered severe burns.</p>

  <p>Gant's two uncles, Ruben Su and Ableson Su, stepped back.</p>

  <p>The building was meant to be temporary and so its foundation wasn't strong enough to withstand the heat.</p>

  <p>With a loud crackle, the building walls began to crack.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards, who were outside the building, heard this. Deciding to investigate, they went in and saw what was happening.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still, his pupils slightly contracting.</p>

  <p>Cailen Su was in the seventh stage of the Other Shore Realm, which meant that even if Luo Zheng went all out, he'd just barely be able to survive.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no intention of going all out. This was never what he intended upon escorting Gant. Cailen Su was Gant's father after all.</p>

  <p>Gant, who had already passed through the blood red array, turned around and stopped in front of Luo Zheng. "Father," he addressed Cailen Su, "if you wish to kill me, your insignificant son, then do it. But please, don't attack my Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>Gant was thankful to Luo Zheng for taking care of him during their long journey towards the Blue Cloud City. Now, he wanted to return the favor by being the protector.</p>

  <p>Cailen's eyes twitched as he stared at his son standing before him.</p>

  <p>He never intended on killing Gant, even if he never lived up to his standards.</p>

  <p>The room began to gradually cool down. Waving his hands furiously, Cailen Su shouted, "Get out!"</p>
