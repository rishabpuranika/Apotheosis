<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2097 Estelle Shi </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the blue-clothed woman appeared, another commotion broke out in the dense fog deep within the divine land.</p>

  <p>These Holy Beings were the strongest existences within the divine land.</p>

  <p>They had lived for hundreds of thousands of years and were rarely surprised by anything. But now, every Holy Being in the Hall of Holy Beings were utterly dumbfounded. As they gasped, their voices were full of great surprise, as if the appearance of this woman in the Evolutionary Universe was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"This woman? Isn't she Estelle Shi?!"</p>

  <p>"This is unbelievable! Estelle is actually still alive!"</p>

  <p>"Why would she appear in the Evolutionary Universe? Didn't she disappear after she took over the Soul Wilderness? Holy Zakaria even went into the depths of the Soul Wilderness to search for her. Not only did he find nothing, but his life vitality weakened considerably once he came out of the Soul Wilderness!"</p>

  <p>This blue-clothed girl was named Estelle Shi, a legendary figure in the divine land.</p>

  <p>She was also the only True God that had stepped into the depths of the Soul Wilderness and taken control of it. Ruling the Soul Wilderness was an unimaginable feat, even for a Holy Being. But Estelle Shi had done it, which was why it was not an exaggeration for Estelle Shi to be called the number one woman in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The woman had also attracted the attention of some Holy Beings. One of them was Zakaria Jian, who was also known as Holy Zakaria.</p>

  <p>In the past, Estelle Shi had hidden in the Soul Wilderness where even Holy Beings couldn't enter easily. Holy Zakaria had searched for her in the Soul Wilderness several times but to no avail. What was worse, he had encountered a lot of troubles in the Soul Wilderness and as a result, his life vitality had depleted greatly. He had to return to the Hall of Holy Beings to recuperate for two divine eras before recovering completely.</p>

  <p>There were some forbidden places in the divine land that even Holy Beings could not recklessly break into.</p>

  <p>A few other Holy Beings were also searching for this woman. She had something to do with a very important secret of the Soul Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Several divine eras ago, Estelle Shi had suddenly disappeared from the divine land. Even Holy Beings had failed to find her.</p>

  <p>There had been rumors that Estelle Shi had escaped from the divine land and stepped into the endless chaos outside it. There were also rumors that she had died.</p>

  <p>These rumors had been circulating for many years, but they gradually faded away with the passage of time.</p>

  <p>It was only when some True Gods roamed the Soul Wilderness that they would occasionally mention the woman who once controlled the Soul Wilderness. After all, before her, not even a Holy Being had been able to control the Soul Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Estelle Shi was gradually being forgotten and became history.</p>

  <p>But the Holy Beings had surprisingly good memories. They would remember every single detail of the past.</p>

  <p>So the moment Estelle Shi appeared on the scene, every Holy Being in the Hall of Holy Beings was puzzled. Just where did this woman pop out from? Had she been hiding in the Evolutionary Universe this entire time?</p>

  <p>A tall, middle-aged man was standing outside the dome of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>This man was dressed in a golden coat armor and held the Mantra Sword in his hand. His eyes glinted gently, just like the light on the spinulose wood fern only purer and thicker. This was Murphy, the Holy Murphy!</p>

  <p>His anger simmered down a little the moment he used the Mantra Sword to strike.</p>

  <p>He had spent a lot of effort to break through the Sighing Wall and had sent out many Sacred Supreme Lords into the war. He had exhausted so much momentum and countless resources in order to change the rules on the stone slab and to send three of his disciples to fight the war.</p>

  <p>In the end, he still had to take action himself.</p>

  <p>This strike was enough to destroy Mike's hopes.</p>

  <p>But he would have to pay a huge price in exchange for it.</p>

  <p>Even a Holy Being would not dare violate the rules on the stone slab, because they would then have to accept the punishment from the slab.</p>

  <p>But it was completely worth it.</p>

  <p>Mike was like a centipede that did not topple over even when dead.</p>

  <p>Murphy was still afraid of Mike's counterattack. If he were to cut off the most important link, Mike's entire plan would be shattered.</p>

  <p>Only by doing this would he be able to rest easy.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Hall of Holy Beings and on the edge of a shoal by the Time Sea, stood a stone slab that was ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>The stone slab was engraved with a number of small characters, some of which were ordinary characters, but there were also a few that were in golden colored Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>It was this stone slab that had recorded the large and small rules of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>These rules were different from the laws on the Divine Dao Tablets. The rules on the stone slab were like the laws of the entire divine land; they couldn't be disobeyed or violated, not even by the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings could formulate and modify the rules to a certain extent, but they would still have to pay a considerable price.</p>

  <p>For example, Murphy had changed a rule so that three True Gods could be sent to fight the war between the universes.</p>

  <p>When Murphy had shattered the Sighing Wall of the Evolutionary Universe and slashed through the dome with his sword, an azure bolt of lightning had appeared on the stone slab.</p>

  <p>This lightning seemed ordinary.</p>

  <p>Any martial artist who had comprehended the first layer of the Thunder Law could achieve that. But even a Holy Being would be afraid of this lightning that emerged from this stone slab.</p>

  <p>The azure lightning instantly shot out with a crack, forming a lightning chain.</p>

  <p>It rushed out of the Time Sea, passing through the Hall of Holy Beings and all the big and small Floating Islands that the clans of Holy Beings inhabited, and headed straight for Murphy.</p>

  <p>Murphy was instantly bound by this lightning chain.</p>

  <p>Murphy didn't resist. He knew that he couldn't defy the punishment of the stone slab. When he had shattered the dome of the Evolutionary Universe, he had been ready to accept punishment. But now that he was bound by the lighting chain, the blue-clothed woman had suddenly appeared within his field of vision.</p>

  <p>"Estelle?"</p>

  <p>Murphy's eyes widened as panic began to take place within their depths.</p>

  <p>He was blanking out, because he hadn't expected this to happen.</p>

  <p>He watched as she opened her arms, flowers blooming around her, dancing in the air, and forming a grand array that stretched for ten thousand miles around her.</p>

  <p>Was she trying to stop his strike?</p>

  <p>"No, no! Estelle! What do you want? We can talk, but you can't stop me!"</p>

  <p>Murphy roared, his voice ringing out of the dome of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>He wanted to break free of the lightning chain and rush into the Evolutionary Universe. But the lightning that had shot out of the stone slab had an absolute binding power in the divine land. Even if he was a Holy Being, he had no chance of breaking free.</p>

  <p>"No!</p>

  <p>No!"</p>

  <p>Despite his constant growling, the lightning chain eventually dragged him away.</p>

  <p>But his voice still echoed within the Evolutionary Universe. The Holy Being's final roar filled the hearts of all the secondary creatures in the Evolutionary Universe with wariness.</p>

  <p>A mysterious smile played on Estelle's lips as she looked at the dome of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Holy Murphy. I didn't mean to make things difficult for you. I was enslaved and controlled by Luo Luo Zheng," she said.</p>

  <p>Murphy obviously couldn't hear her. If he could, he would be furious.</p>

  <p>The next moment, a sea of flowers surrounded the woman.</p>

  <p>As she made a gesture in which her fingers were shaped like an orchid and waved her hands, the petals began to dance in the air. They formed into a tornado of petals that faced Murphy's sword slash.</p>

  <p>The power behind Murphy's strike was no joke. Anyone who touched the sword radiance would be destroyed instantly.</p>

  <p>The same was true for the beautiful petals. The moment the soft petals touched the sword radiance, they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>However, the petals left dark spots the size of a copper coin on the wide sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Each petal could leave a dark spot, and such a large number of petals were like a rain of petals rushing towards the sword radiance. The sword radiance had eliminated the petals, but the petals were also eroding the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>As the two strong powers clashed, the petals scattered, and the gigantic sword radiance began to shrink rapidly like a piece of ice in summer.</p>

  <p>The ray of sword radiance had an astonishing momentum.</p>

  <p>When it was a million miles away from Luo Luo Zheng, there was only half the sword radiance left.</p>

  <p>When it was 300, 000 miles away, more than half of it had been eroded by the petals, leaving only a third of the original.</p>

  <p>When the sword radiance was 100, 000 miles away, it was only one-tenth of what it originally had been.</p>

  <p>And when it finally landed in front of Luo Luo Zheng, the petals had already wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng. At this moment, the sword radiance was only a 100 millionth of the original and the size of a finger. Its power was negligible!</p>

  <p>But it still landed on Luo Zheng's forehead.</p>
