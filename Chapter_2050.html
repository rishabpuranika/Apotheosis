  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hiding in the shadows were the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, also feeling extremely conflicted in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Because Maha had always been considered the leader of their Sacred race's expedition team, all their decisions and strategies were left to him.</p>

  <p>He had challenged the geniuses in the Sunflower Water World to suppress the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe. Now, not only was he unable to suppress the momentum, he had even lost his life in the battle.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had made sufficient preparations before Maha set off.</p>

  <p>Even if he died there, he would still be brought back to life. His father, the Grand Supreme Lord, had prepared another precious body for him.</p>

  <p>But to the entire Sacred race, it was an unprecedented setback.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Sacred race's previous plan had been disrupted completely. Even the wise Supreme Lords didn't know what to do next.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng must die," Supreme Lord Denzel said seriously.</p>

  <p>Amongst all the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race present, only Supreme Lord Denzel was a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Now that Maha had been killed, he was the only one left with the right to speak up.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel and Maha never had a very good relationship. But the matter of their Godly Genius being killed was no small matter. It was impossible for them to allow Luo Zheng to leave just like that.</p>

  <p>"But should we make a move now?" Another Supreme Lord seemed hesitant.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng had killed three Supreme Lords in the blink of an eye gave them quite a shock. It was natural that these Supreme Lords felt a sense of fear and cowardice— none of them wanted to be Zheng's fourth kill.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Don't forget our goal. We originally wanted to force the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe to fight with us. Now that Maha is dead and Luo Zheng is still in the Sunflower Water World, we'll deal with Luo Zheng there. Do those cowards dare to make a move now?" Supreme Lord Denzel said with a sneer. "Zheng's methods may be strange but in the end, he's still just a world lord. I saw that he killed Barrie and the rest by relying solely on that strange cyan light on his sword. All we need to do is avoid it. But none of you even have a little courage. I feel quite bad for Holy Murphy for having bestowed the Heavenly Destinies upon you cowards."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel made his thoughts quite clear.</p>

  <p>Although Maha's death was a major setback, it hadn't actually been a major blow to the Sacred race. At most, it increased the momentum within the Evolutionary Universe. At this moment, if a decisive battle broke out, the Sacred race's reinforcements would arrive soon.</p>

  <p>Such wasn't what the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe hoped to see. The Sacred race had so many Supreme Lords. Were they really afraid of Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel's words were reasonable, after all.</p>

  <p>"I'll disrupt the Space Law of the Sunflower Water World. You guys must prepare to deal with Luo Zheng," said Supreme Lord Denzel. At this moment, he spread his arms wide and a huge altar appeared behind him— the altar of the Sacred race. The Heavenly Destiny he used was created by Murphy himself, a spatial ability that he gained from studying the real Sacred race.</p>

  <p>But just as the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race made their move, the Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe also began moving.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race, as well as the other forces in the Evolutionary Universe, had been patient with the Sacred race all the while— they were waiting for a good opportunity.</p>

  <p>Being patient was a rather painful process, no one could deny. For example, the Humanity Alliance had been slowly taken over and Nathan had been killed, his corpse fed to the wolves. These Supreme Lords were the strongest powerhouses in the Evolutionary Universe, the highest overlords. Although they were all proud and arrogant, they had managed to endure until now.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Master Feng finally received Wynn's order.</p>

  <p>"Prepare to make a move after a hundred and fifty seconds."</p>

  <p>Standing on a Dark Star was Wynn, hidden in the deep space. After issuing this order, he stomped his foot heavily on the star.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The motion contained strong momentum.</p>

  <p>Such was the momentum Wynn had. Although the scale of this inner world was far from that of a Holy Being's and he himself didn't possess any Heavens-suppressing Object, the momentum he exuded was still extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Dark Star under his feet dragged out a dim ray of light as it rapidly descended.</p>

  <p>It descended toward the supreme world in which the Spring race once lived. A few years back, the Sacred race had opened up this universe's Sighing Wall and invaded the Evolutionary Universe. Afterward, the Sacred race's warriors occupied the Spring race's three supreme worlds, using them as a springboard to take over the land of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Dark Star was descending unbelievably fast. All the creatures in many supreme worlds saw a faint ray of light shooting towards the southernmost part of the universe as the star rapidly fell.</p>

  <p>There weren't many Dark Stars in the Evolutionary Universe. At the beginning of each grand era, a new sun would appear.</p>

  <p>But a sun had a lifespan of only 700 million years or so. When the sun's light was completely released, the huge fireball continuously collapsed towards the center, condensing and shrinking to a millionth of its original size.</p>

  <p>So the mass of a Dark Star was extremely terrifying, even more so than the Star Essence Iron. Wynn had also expended much effort to move this Dark Star.</p>

  <p>The Sighing Wall of the universe was extremely sturdy. Even with Murphy's support, the Sacred race still had to expend a great amount of energy just to break through a 200-foot hole in the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Surrounding this hole were numerous buildings constructed by the Sacred race. The defensive enchanted barriers alone went up to 60 layers.</p>

  <p>Such was the only path for the Sacred race to invade the Evolutionary Universe, after all. If this path was sealed off, it would trouble the Sacred race greatly.</p>

  <p>Outside the hole was a massive squad— it had over a hundred world lords, including a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race that guarded it at all times.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>One of the world lords of the Sacred race was on patrol and raised his head to look at the sky. Within his line of sight, a black dot appeared, growing larger and larger.</p>

  <p>"Alas, now that the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe is in full swing, I'm afraid that another star has fallen. Hurry and report this to Supreme Lord Wilbur. Activate all the enchanted barriers!" another world lord of the Sacred race urged helplessly.</p>

  <p>From the very first step the Sacred race had taken into the Evolutionary Universe, they had received much malice, followed by all sorts of natural disasters.</p>

  <p>But this place was the most important passageway for the Sacred race— they had protected it well. Supreme Lord Wilbur, who was guarding this place, was an expert at creating enchanted barriers. If an ordinary star fell on them, it wouldn't do any damage.</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't seem like an ordinary star…" the world lord continued, still staring at the sky.</p>

  <p>The Dark Star itself couldn't release any light. No matter how good one's vision was, one couldn't find traces of it in the starry sky with their naked eyes. The star could absorb the surrounding light, concealing itself completely in the dark void.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, Wynn controlled the Dark Star. It fell extremely quickly, forming a circle of dark red flames as it rubbed against space at a high speed.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists of the Sacred race also noticed the strange phenomenon in the sky. Some began reporting to Supreme Lord Wilbur.</p>

  <p>Soon, a middle-aged man clad in a blue robe flew into the air. He was Supreme Lord Wilber, the one responsible for protecting this place.</p>

  <p>When he looked up, his eyes seemed cautious. He noticed that the falling star was no ordinary thing, so he stretched out his hand and a thin, square-shaped plate appeared above his head. The moment the thin plate appeared, it began to spin rapidly.</p>

  <p>In an instant, enchanted barriers appeared around the Supreme Lord one after another.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Wilbur's enchanted barriers were extremely powerful. The faint curtains of light were enough to resist Supreme Lords' attacks.</p>

  <p>These enchanted barriers formed quickly, covering everything within a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Besides the enchanted barriers Supreme Lord Wilbur personally set up, the other warriors of the Sacred race also activated all sorts of divine textures, shining with all sorts of colors until there were abundant defensive enchanted barriers around them.</p>

  <p>The entire process took around ten seconds— clearly, the Sacred race was well-prepared.</p>

  <p>But how could blocking Wynn's carefully-planned attack be so easy?</p>

  <p>The mass of the Dark Star was already frightening enough. After Wynn activated it, it came crashing down so quickly— its hidden power was unimaginably terrifying.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the Dark Star was still several dozen miles from the ground, the pressure it emitted caused a bend in Supreme Lord Wilbur's enchanted barriers.</p>
