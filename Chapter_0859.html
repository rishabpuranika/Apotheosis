  <p>A seat owner had just challenged a war fighter. It was the kind of thing that probably had never ever happened before in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The seat owners were all tenth-level war lords, and one might even call them peak-level war lords. They were only one step away from becoming war sages, while Luo Luo Zheng, who was a tenth-level war fighter, was two whole realms away from even becoming a peak-level war lord, let alone a war sage.</p>

  <p>Even though his potential was high and he was extremely powerful indeed, he still wouldn't be a match for Malcom.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Tower of Sin, martial artists on the upper floors weren't allowed to fight with those on the lower floors. Malcom had personally broken this rule now; the consequences of this action were too troublesome to imagine, which was the reason why the expressions of so many martial artists suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>If a seat owner from the ogres took lead and broke this rule, then the martial artists of the other races would ignore this rule and descend on lower floors too.</p>

  <p>If that happened, the Tower of Sin would fall into endless chaos again.</p>

  <p>No race wanted this to happen.</p>

  <p>Maybe that was the reason why, but in any case, just as Malcom was about to enter the arena, an ethereal voice suddenly called out, "You're an ogre war lord, but you challenge a martial artist on the tenth floor. It's against the rules, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked towards the direction of the voice and saw Cheryl, who was dressed in green.</p>

  <p>Boris and Cheryl were the strongest warriors on the tenth floor. But why did Cheryl call Malcolm out like that? Didn't she know that Malcom was intentionally breaking the rule in order to kill Luo Luo Zheng? Or did the Demon Night want to maintain the order in the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>It wasn't impossible when one thought about it. After all, the Demon Night enjoyed enormous benefits in the Tower of Sin, and the seats they owned were second only to the ogres' in number. Only the Demon Night had the strength to confront the ogres.</p>

  <p>However, many creatures had heard the words of the Demon Night's seat owner, Madeline earlier on and from her expressions, it seemed that the Demon Night did not want to interfere in this matter. Now, Madeline was sitting by unconcerned, but Cheryl, a junior, had come forwards to speak.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>When Malcom was about to walk towards the arena, the expressions of Olivia, Fabian and Jarrod had also changed drastically. Fabian was hesitant about whether or not he should stop Malcom.</p>

  <p>Once Malcom made a move, it was very likely that the fight would evolve into a war between the humans and the ogres.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place was definitely not a match for the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, and there was a huge disparity between the power of the humans with four seats and the ogres with more than twenty seats in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Malcom's large eyes turned as he sneered, "I know what I'm doing. A junior like you is unqualified to remind me. Where is Madeline?"</p>

  <p>Malcom could not figure out what Madeline was thinking. She had not uttered a single word, but had allowed a junior of the Demon Night, Cheryl, to come out and confront him? Why? The attitude of the Demon Night was extremely important. Therefore, Malcom had to shift the topic of the conversation towards Madeline. He wanted to confirm whether the Demon Night was interfering or not.</p>

  <p>Cheryl was reprimanded by Malcom, but her face remained calm. Hearing her name mentioned, Madeline finally stood up and remarked in a soft voice, "The rules of the Tower of Sin were jointly set by us. I think that Cheryl is the only one qualified to challenge Luo Luo Zheng. After their fight, you're free to do everything you want."</p>

  <p>The subtext of Madeline's words was very clear. The Demon Night didn't want to have a hand in the ogres breaking the rule. They were only concerned about Cheryl's fight with Luo Luo Zheng, and as to what Malcom would do after the fight, they didn't care at all.</p>

  <p>Actually, Madeline had said at the very beginning that she didn't want to interfere in this matter. She hadn't changed her mind now, but when Cheryl had seen the fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Boris, she was eager to give it a try and challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As an elder of the Demon Night, Madeline had agreed to Cheryl's request, which was the reason why she had stepped forward to stop Malcom.</p>

  <p>Hearing Madeline's words, Malcom coldly laughed. "Very well, I will take my time then." With that said, he stood with his hands behind his back to the side.</p>

  <p>In any case, from Malcom's point of view, Luo Luo Zheng was bound to die and would not be able to survive today's calamity no matter what happened. As long as the Demon Night did not intervene, everything was going to be under Malcom's control. As to those human seat owners, the ogres could kill them easily if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>Cheryl smiled faintly and said, "Thank you, war lord."</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, her figure flashed, leaving a green light in the air. It was as if she had penetrated through space and entered the arena.</p>

  <p>"Cheryl cultivates both her body and her life vitality. Her Space Law is becoming more and more proficient now. It seems like she has mastered the second layer."</p>

  <p>"She really has very strong perception. It's said that she is only 20 years old.</p>

  <p>But she has already grasped the second layer of the Space Law at such a young age."</p>

  <p>"In the history of the Tower of Sin, there hasn't been a war general that has mastered the second layer of the Space Law. Can she defeat Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Creatures from many different races watched with excitement, while humans watched with worry!</p>

  <p>Olivia and the rest had seen a glimmer of hope when the Demon Night had suddenly joined in on the debate. They could only place their hopes on the Demon Night, but they never expected that the Demon Night had no intentions of interfering at all. It was merely Cheryl's own idea to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This showed that the humans were already weak to quite a large extent.</p>

  <p>They were just like fish on a chopping board, and the other races could cut them in whatever ways they wanted to. This was the tragedy of the weak.</p>

  <p>Since Cheryl's challenge had temporarily delayed Malcom's move, what was next?</p>

  <p>Her strength was not the least bit weaker than Boris'. Moreover, she cultivated her body and life vitality, so it was impossible to guard against her attacks.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng defeated Cheryl, he still had to fight with Malcom. In a word, Luo Luo Zheng was at a dead end now.</p>

  <p>Olivia and the others had worry written all over their faces. They were unable to find a way to resolve this situation.</p>

  <p>All they could do was to pray that Luo Luo Zheng could, somehow, create a miracle.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how high Luo Zheng's talent was, he was still only a tenth-level war fighter. He didn't even have the ability to fight against a tenth-level war lord.</p>

  <p>Olivia let out a faint sigh as she looked at the heroic and imposing young man standing on the arena. A deep sense of helplessness enveloped her since she didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>If anyone else came to know that there was a tenth-level war lord who was eyeing him or her with hostility, he or she wouldn't be in a mood to duel.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a faint smile on Luo Zheng's face, as if he didn't take the killing intent before him to heart. Many people felt that Luo Luo Zheng was just trying to remain calm, but in this situation, he needed some confidence. The question was, how was he so confident?</p>

  <p>Many creatures kept guessing but still couldn't figure out why.</p>

  <p>Cheryl walked gracefully into the arena, and a slender sword appeared in her hand. She then spoke in a light and gentle voice, "Luo Luo Zheng, I want to challenge you."</p>

  <p>With a slight movement of his long sword, Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"You have the strength to defeat Boris, but you may not be my match!"</p>

  <p>Cheryl continued softly.</p>

  <p>"Since we're already on the arena, there's no need to speak so much," Luo Luo Zheng replied indifferently to this powerful talent of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"You are very proud. I hope you can maintain your pride!" After Cheryl finished speaking, her figure flashed and she took a step forward. In the blink of an eye, she had crossed a distance of 60 to 70 feet and was now standing beside Luo Luo Zheng. Then she brandished her sword and pointed it straight at Luo Zheng's eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"The Space Law!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. His body also flickered as he took a step forward and traveled through space.</p>

  <p>Cheryl's sword seemed to have hit Luo Luo Zheng, but in reality, Luo Luo Zheng had already left where he was standing and had now appeared behind Cheryl. He also slashed down at Cheryl in the same way.</p>

  <p>"Both of them are using Space Law?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't Luo Luo Zheng a body refiner? It turns out that he also cultivates the life vitality!"</p>

  <p>"Just how many cards does this brat have in his hand?"</p>

  <p>In a situation where both sides had grasped the Space Law, it was often difficult to determine the victor in a battle.</p>

  <p>With the Space Law, one could freely travel about, so it was extremely difficult to completely block off the opponent's escape route.</p>

  <p>Also, because of this suspense, the battle situation would become more and more intense, and the tempo would also become very high.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng traveled through space and appeared behind Cheryl, who in the blink of an eye, also traveled through space and appeared on the side of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, when Cheryl thrust out her sword, Luo Luo Zheng had traveled through space and left.</p>

  <p>Figures began to appear and disappear alternatively, leaving the audience dazzled. Although the two were dressed differently, they moved so fast that some martial artists weren't able to distinguish them.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>While travelling through space, Luo Luo Zheng finally caught onto a gap, and the two swords immediately clashed seven or eight times.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure sword techniques, Cheryl was at a disadvantage. Although she had watched the battle between Luo Luo Zheng and Boris, and witnessed Luo Zheng's No Move technique, she still couldn't resist him because his moves were invisible.</p>
