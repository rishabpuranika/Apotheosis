<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under everyone's gaze, Zheng seemed to glide as though his body was a piece of light paper.</p>

  <p>While the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had great strength, she was too clumsy to capture even the creatures of small races, let alone Zheng who moved that fast.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes flashed with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>It was crucial for Zheng to make such a move. The Oneness Sky Palace would probably lose their chance completely otherwise.</p>

  <p>Even the leaders outside the Chaotic Source World were attracted by Zheng's figure.</p>

  <p>They never had been through such a strong hurricane and had no clue how terrifying it actually was.</p>

  <p>But even the Divine Lair's demon women and the races that could fly well kept away from it— clearly, the hurricane was something no one wanted to get caught up in.</p>

  <p>But Zheng seemed so free in the winds. It should be because he relied on the jade-like feather. However, no one there knew where the feather had come from.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Zheng fought the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, a voice message with life vitality resounded in his ear— it was from Chaim.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, lead her to the Bearing race," he suggested.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race, along with the three other major races, had exerted their strength in attacking the Oneness Sky Palace's disciples, including Milo.</p>

  <p>Almost all the disciples that remained had been attacked by these four races. In spite of the great number of disciples they eliminated, they left no evidence behind.</p>

  <p>It was the perfect opportunity to get their revenge— how could they just let it pass?</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I was thinking!"</p>

  <p>In the hurricane, Zheng turned around and flew straight toward the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>They, along with the New Moon race, shared the same array, while the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race occupied one array each.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng heading toward them, Khalid and the rest understood his intent immediately.</p>

  <p>He wanted to take advantage of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits to drive them away!</p>

  <p>"You brat! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"If you dare come any closer, I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race cursed at the sight of Zheng's move.</p>

  <p>Nearby, the Separate Abyss people were mocking them— they were pleased to see the others' distress.</p>

  <p>In the face of the threats of the super forces, Zheng's expression remained totally steady. He fell right into the array where the Bearing race stayed.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits ran at full speed, the ground trembled under her heavy steps. She followed closely behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You brat, get out of here!" Khalid's face was dark and cold like he was entirely ready to swallow Zheng up at that moment.</p>

  <p>The others of the Bearing race were also pointing fingers accusingly at Zheng, cursing him.</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely stood there with his hands behind his back, looking totally indifferent. Wearing a faint smile on his face, he looked at them firmly.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them, they had no way to fight in the array— they couldn't touch Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing how close the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was getting, Khalid called to the rest, "Guys, let's get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was deliberately leading the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits there.</p>

  <p>The array would definitely be trampled to pieces by her heavy steps. To keep them safe, Khalid had to dismiss his clansmen.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the Bearing race were reluctant, they had no other choice. All they could do was throw daggers at Zheng with their hateful glares. After going through the light shield, all of them were blown away by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>With a spear in hand, Khalid jumped into the air and moved out of the light shield.</p>

  <p>The moment he was exposed, the long spear light flashed in his hand and pierced the ground.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A sharp beam of light shot out from the tip of his spear and penetrated the ground.</p>

  <p>Among the disciples of the Bearing race under the Chaotic Source Realm, Khalid was the most powerful. While he was indeed proud and arrogant, he wasn't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The beam of light was like an extension of his very arm. The moment it rushed to the ground, it split into two, then four, then eight— it seemed like a split tree root that extended infinitely into the ground.</p>

  <p>In mere seconds, it had turned into thousands of beams of light fixed into the ground.</p>

  <p>These were all connected to the tip of his spear, stabilizing his foundation.</p>

  <p>"Impressive!"</p>

  <p>"He can resist the hurricane?"</p>

  <p>"Still… he's not as good as Zheng…"</p>

  <p>Although the hurricane was truly powerful, it wasn't impossible to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Some people had special means to do so.</p>

  <p>Khalid was extraordinary enough to have attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's unwavering presence had stolen the limelight.</p>

  <p>Completely unaffected by the hurricane, Zheng proved to be more powerful than Khalid.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits took a step toward the array's light shield. But at that moment, only Zheng remained in the array.</p>

  <p>Before she stomped down, Zheng moved out of the area. Simultaneously, his eyes met Khalid's before he revealed a sly smile.</p>

  <p>Khalid's heart sank upon seeing Zheng's smile.</p>

  <p>He couldn't move as he could only fix himself with his spear. What was Zheng planning to do?</p>

  <p>Halfway through that thought, Zheng floated and headed toward him.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Khalid was a decisive character. The moment he withdrew his long spear, he turned over to shoot a spear light at Zheng.</p>

  <p>This move was mere revenge. He was well aware that it would miss Zheng and that he'd be swept away by the hurricane anyway.</p>

  <p>But once he was blown away about 20, 000 feet, he once again stabbed his spear into the ground. The spear light extended infinitely into the ground and fixed himself once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have any more time to mess with the guy. Once Khalid was far away, Zheng continued guiding mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits to the next array.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng rush over, the faces of the demon women of the Sun Crow race darkened. They spread their wings and flew away along with the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's figure stopped midair as he looked to the left. Now, only the Divine Farmer race remained in the array.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race all twisted their faces in anger.</p>

  <p>They had curated an entire plan, even sending out the hit list in the hopes of killing Zheng and Elvinia. But it was to no avail— they even suffered many losses because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth, in particular, was staring intently at Zheng as though she was ready to swallow him alive.</p>

  <p>In the array, Mount stood still. When he saw Zheng fly over, he shut his eyes and steadily said, "All of you, get out."</p>

  <p>The rest of the Divine Farmer race nodded before heading out of the array.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, what about me?" Mya took a seat to the side and asked.</p>

  <p>"Just help me," Mount replied.</p>

  <p>Mya's eyes glittered at that.</p>

  <p>She knew that sooner or later, Mount would be fighting Zheng and the man called Evil God.</p>

  <p>Mount was a sedate man who often looked at the bigger picture. Before gaining the confidence to win, he first chose to dodge.</p>

  <p>But now, he couldn't bear it.</p>

  <p>"Okay!" With a mischievous smile, Mya caressed her curly locks and raised them up.</p>

  <p>When Zheng stepped out of the array with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits following him, Mya's curly hair extended outside the array and transformed into thin, steel needles. They shot right at the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>
