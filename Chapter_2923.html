<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2923 The Power Of Moonlight </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Clement had his back flat on the ground and his eyes towards Emily who was hovering over him. To Clement's surprise, she had transformed into a giant.</p>

  <p>"Is that the body of a Wild God?"</p>

  <p>Clement was sure of what it was. It was almost unbelievable for him, except he knew that Emily had the strength to transform into a giant in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, the Ancient God Cultivation Method had completely disappeared from the Source World. And so it shocked him to witness it again in the divine land.</p>

  <p>As soon as Emily had activated the body of Wild God, she immediately launched an attack. She towered over Clement who was looking like a tiny ant for her. She simply held her finger towards Clement, allowed it to emit circles of colorful light and, with great force, pressed Clement with it.</p>

  <p>Unless Clement found a way to magically escape Emily's giant finger, he was as good as dead. In a moment of desperation, two blood runes suddenly emerged from his eyes.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the power of the two runes covered Clement and his entire body was now covered in blood!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The ground beneath them vibrated against the impact of Emily's huge finger. As it did, the Heavenly Mirror Shield appeared on the surface of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Mirror Shield protected the divine land from the wrath of Emily's force. Otherwise, the divine land would have been shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Any other powerful warrior of the Other Shore Realm would have had turned into a pool of blood with Emily's attack.</p>

  <p>But Clement still had something up his sleeve. Instead of letting himself be shattered, he gave up his life force and turned himself into a corpse. This way, he turned into a dead man but with an almost invincible corpse.</p>

  <p>Using this power came with many risks, of course. Each time he would use it, he had to actually kill himself and only a secret method could be used to bring himself back to life. He didn't use it unless he was desperate.</p>

  <p>As Emily lifted her finger, she was astonished to see Clement's body in full form. She lifted her palm and, with all the rage she had, motioned towards Clement. Colorful lights covered her palm as she slapped with full force.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Clement's corpse rolled on the ground and would occasionally become as thin as a sheet of paper under Emily's attack. His bones, meridians, and viscera were crushed under Emily's palm.</p>

  <p>But, the moment Emily lifted her hand, his body would recover and remain whole.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! Damn, woman! I'll show you..."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before Clement could finish his sentence, he was attacked by Emily's palm again.</p>

  <p>As soon as his body recovered, he shouted, "Godfrey! What the hell are you doing now?"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards, Nine Li Guards, and Snake Goddess race were fighting in a battle. Meanwhile, Godfrey was entangled by Lorena, Mike, Moon and other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, the gap of strength between a Holy Being and an Other Shore Realm warrior was too large. Although Godfrey's strength was only slightly stronger than Abbas's and ranked second to last among the Yellow Emperor Guards, he alone was enough to counter with all the Holy Beings! In the battle, he had managed to kill Marsh, the Holy Being from the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"Fiery Soul Attack!"</p>

  <p>Vanessa used a secret technique to launch a soul attack at Godfrey, making her eyes glow a fiery light.</p>

  <p>The attack was strong. Any Holy Being would have been defeated, but Godfrey was not. He merely let out a triumphant laugh.</p>

  <p>He was about to tease Vanessa when he heard Clement's furious roar in the distance. He turned to look at where it came from and was shocked to see Clement lying on the ground like a corpse. Godfrey's eyes widened as he realized Emily, who had assumed the form of a giant, was pressing Clement against the ground.</p>

  <p>Godfrey left the scene abruptly and raised the jade plate in his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The jade plate trembled and crescent moons appeared in the sky above the divine land one by one.</p>

  <p>The crescent moons formed the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. The array was arranged by him as soon as they arrived at the surface of the divine land. Finally, the array revealed itself to everyone.</p>

  <p>With the help of the divine crystals' power, the Slaughtering Moonlight Array covered an area of tens of thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt the power of the crescent moons. Everyone raised their heads in acknowledgment. Even Emily was forced to stop the attacks and look at the sky.</p>

  <p>"The Slaughtering Moonlight Array! They brought the powerful array with them!" Ramzi shouted in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Ramzi was proficient in the runic arrays and had studied every array in the Source World. He knew that the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, while not the most powerful, was incredibly well-known in the Source World.</p>

  <p>People from the Nine Li race and the Snake Goddess race looked at Ramzi in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Shift the core of the array to me!" Clement commanded.</p>

  <p>Godfrey spun the jade plate and all the crescent moons followed. They rotated in the sky and the beams of bright moonlight shot towards Clement.</p>

  <p>A blood rune in Clement's hand broke apart and quickly turned into a blood sword. The surface of the sword shone with a layer of silver light as it reflected the moonlight. Clement grinned and glared at Emily with piercing stares as he slashed the sword at her.</p>

  <p>As soon as he moved, the crescent moons flashed with a silver light.</p>

  <p>Emily had no time to react. She tried to dodge but was already too late.</p>

  <p>Next thing she knew, there was a violent tearing pain in her arm. As she glanced over, her right arm had been cut off from her body. As soon as the arm dropped to the ground, it shrunk to its original size. Blood spilled out from her amputated shoulder like a waterfall.</p>

  <p>"Let's see if you can dodge this," Clement teased with a laugh. Once more, he felt invincible.</p>

  <p>Just as Clement raised his silver sword, a figure clad in green rushed out from the side. It was an Other Shore Realm warrior from the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>"Isla! No!"</p>

  <p>Emily exclaimed as she saw the woman in green.</p>

  <p>Clement sneered and waved the silver sword once more. He wasn't aiming at Isla, but she was blocking his way, and so her body was torn apart from the middle and blood splashed all over the ground.</p>

  <p>Isla and Emily were incredibly close. Isla had been shadowing Emily for countless years. Emily was devastated at the sight of Isla's broken body.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sad. You'll join her soon," Clement said with a chuckle as he raised the silver sword up high.</p>

  <p>With the power of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, he now had everything under his control.</p>

  <p>Ramzi gnashed his teeth at the sight of Clement. He took out a yellow talisman, patted it, and spurted a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>His blood stained the talisman. It burned and erupted into flames. The flames flew towards the crescent moons in the sky.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Clement slashed his sword at Emily.</p>
