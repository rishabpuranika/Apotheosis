<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3499 Ranking First On The First Floor </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The truth was that Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits were indeed no different from the others'.</p>

  <p>What actually set him apart from the rest was the Truth of Divine Dao contained in his physical body.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits of all the powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors could not bear an infinite amount of power forever.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng's couldn't as well.</p>

  <p>However, the Truth of Divine Dao formed from his body could quickly nourish the Chaotic Source Spirits. Not only could it strengthen them, but it could also immediately stop them from being fatigued.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Every time a large palm print exploded on Luo Zheng, the golden light around his body flashed, and the Chaotic Source Spirits absorbed the aura of the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>In the past month, Luo Zheng had endured such attacks day and night.</p>

  <p>The difference lay in the fact that using the Green Jade statues' attacks required a lot of divine crystals, while Cleon's attacks were free.</p>

  <p>The palm strikes continued, and his body was tossed higher and higher.</p>

  <p>The palm prints formed one after another, attacked his body, and then dispersed.</p>

  <p>The audience's eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng, who was flying up in the air.</p>

  <p>They hoped to see his body be torn into pieces and thoroughly disintegrated, but it never happened!</p>

  <p>"Haven't his Chaotic Source Spirits been exhausted yet?" a man with a dark and sallow face uttered in astonishment. This sallow-faced man was ranked 19th on the first floor and could be considered as a top warrior in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>According to his assessment, he estimated that four palm strikes from Cleon was enough to exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body.</p>

  <p>In other words, he could take the four palm attacks from Cleon head-on, but after that he would definitely be defeated.</p>

  <p>As of now, Cleon's series of large palm prints had slapped Luo Zheng more than ten times, but the latter was still unharmed.</p>

  <p>'Has this guy really just reached the Chaotic Source Realm?' Cleon thought in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..."</p>

  <p>Cleon's eyes gleamed with amazement, even as he continued to rain a barrage of attacks on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had almost activated his strength to the limit!</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token that Cleon fused with was from Stage Eighteen. It could unleash as much as 5, 000 Jun of force, but the bearing capacity of Cleon's physical body was limited. If he activated 5, 000 Jun of power in one go, it would be difficult for his Chaotic Source Spirits to bear it.</p>

  <p>Whenever Cleon launched a palm attack, he released 3, 500 Jun of power. It was clearly less than the token's full force, but the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body got slightly weak and exhausted!</p>

  <p>If things went on like that, he might not be able to withstand his own actions anymore, let alone destroy Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he would be ashamed if he lost to a warrior who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>As Cleon thought of it, he gritted his teeth and went all out!</p>

  <p>He proceeded to unleash more power from the Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>He condensed three colossal palm prints again, and shot them towards Luo Zheng who was in the air.</p>

  <p>While he launched the three large palm prints, he took a deep breath, and the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body died out one by one.</p>

  <p>Those Chaotic Source Spirits had been completely exhausted.</p>

  <p>After he lost the Chaotic Source Spirits' support, he didn't dare activate the Other Shore Token anymore. Otherwise, his body would collapse before he could even release the power.</p>

  <p>"Three palm strikes are already Cleon's limit..."</p>

  <p>"If those three moves can't defeat Luo Zheng, then Cleon would lose!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that that guy will create a record..."</p>

  <p>The warriors who had stayed in the Land of Sword Grief for a long time could see that Cleon had already reached his limit. He was now like a spent arrow.</p>

  <p>As soon as the three palm prints charged straight towards Luo Zheng, he changed his posture in the air, which made the Shade Stone liquid inside his body disperse to his bones.</p>

  <p>It was prohibited to use special abilities of Other Shore Tokens in the battle arena, but since the Shade Stone liquid was a part of Luo Zheng's body, then it shouldn't be a problem.</p>

  <p>The moment he had adjusted his position, the three palm prints came at him.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" "Bang!" "Bang!"</p>

  <p>The horrifyingly violent Other Shore Power hit his body and spread out.</p>

  <p>The space around him shook constantly, like an empty house in a hurricane's eye.</p>

  <p>The force of those palm strikes would've torn a normal space apart.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, it was obvious that there was something used to stabilize the space in the battle arena. So, the space around the arena shook violently and then eventually became steady.</p>

  <p>Despite having endured three palm attacks, Luo Zheng's physical body was as stable as before!</p>

  <p>Just then, he lightly tapped in mid-air like a nimble bird, and landed gently on the arena afterwards. He looked at Cleon with calm eyes.</p>

  <p>He did not do anything.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cleon's Chaotic Source Spirits had gotten exhausted, and now he could not withstand a single blow.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else he could do, and he just glared at Luo Zheng with great displeasure.</p>

  <p>Finally, he pulled a long face and stood in front of his opponent, unwilling to admit defeat. "You don't want to admit defeat? Do you want to wait for the Chaotic Source Spirits to recover?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I... I... I lost," Cleon stammered.</p>

  <p>When he admitted that he lost, the newcomers burst into cheers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's triumph over Cleon, however, had nothing to do with those newcomers. They still had to compete with each other and determine the rankings.</p>

  <p>The newcomers were certainly displeased by the attitudes of the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief, and it was Luo Zheng who had helped them to vent out their resentment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Abdul who stayed under the platform, and asked, "Do you think you are qualified to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had effortlessly beaten the warrior who ranked first on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Indeed, a disciple who was ranked over 500th wasn't qualified to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Abdul stood there stiffly and shook his head when Luo Zheng's cold gaze stared straight at him.</p>

  <p>As for Chance, he was even more dejected.</p>

  <p>After all, the fact that he had lost to Luo Zheng always made him miserable.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng had defeated his brother after a few months just added salt to the wound. Did fate send this guy to torture them?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the warriors who belonged to the first floor of the Land of Sword Grief still stood there in amazement.</p>

  <p>The way they looked at Luo Zheng had completely changed.</p>

  <p>The strength he had just shown didn't seem like it was at its limit.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he had endured Cleon's attacks without making a move.</p>

  <p>How terrifying could he be if he fought back?</p>

  <p>With such a level of strength, he could break through to the second floor completely...</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Ranking Stone's light flashed, and the rankings had changed.</p>

  <p>Cleon's name was forcefully pushed behind Luo Zheng's, while Luo Zheng now ranked first on the first floor!</p>

  <p>"A new record was formed. On the first day of entering the Land of Sword Grief, that warrior has managed to make his ranking go up by 1, 116 places, and directly rank first on the first floor. His promotion is even faster than that of Li Bianxue..." a disciple muttered. He was absolutely floored when he saw the prompt beside Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that this guy has performed very well and made a splash at the Seven Mountains Meeting. I really didn't expect..." another disciple muttered and looked at the Ranking Stone, completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Land of Sword Grief paid close attention to the change in the Ranking Stone which was the evidence of their strength.</p>

  <p>When the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief saw the change in Luo Zheng's ranking, many of them suddenly thought of Li Bianxue, who was the number one warrior in the entire Land of Sword Grief.</p>
