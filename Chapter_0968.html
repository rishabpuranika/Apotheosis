<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A myriad of emotions crossed through Xi Youqin's face as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng. "Tell me your name!" she demanded through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning rarely left her home, but she was more or less well-informed about the young elites of the Central Region. She had not participated in the Martial Arts Contest of Oracle City two years ago, but she had lent Brent a hand in studying and forming strategies against his potential opponents.</p>

  <p>This man in front of her was undoubtedly young, and yet he had already reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm. He was no ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Robin had sent word for her to go out to meet him, but without telling her anything about this man. Conflict had immediately arisen between her and Luo Luo Zheng at their first contact, leaving no space for Robin to properly introduce them to each other.</p>

  <p>"Why? So you can find an opportunity to take revenge afterwards?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile, seemingly unaffected by her obvious aggression.</p>

  <p>"That's right!" Mu Ning answered him quickly and without any trace of hesitation. She had no intentions of hiding anything. Granted, she was only a beginner of the Internal Elixir Realm, but she had the Purple Power Body. Once she had trained enough, her strength would be unmatched. A cultivator with the Purple Power Body would be able to stay in the Purple Power World for a period of time after reaching the Internal Elixir Realm. The length of the duration would increase more and more by cultivating herself to the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Finally, it would then be possible to summon the 99 billion huge swords and the true spirit from the Purple Power World. However, the cost of such power would be extremely high.</p>

  <p>Marilyn had previously tried to summon the true spirit upon her encounter with Luo Luo Zheng at the Martial Arts Contest. According to the cyan dragon's words, if Marilyn had been successful, Luo Luo Zheng would have undoubtedly met his end.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not even flinch at Xi Youqin's threats. With a small smile, he said,</p>

  <p>"I look forward to it. My name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo?" Mu Ning repeated his name slowly, her eyebrows knitted together as the sound of his name recalled a familiar ring from her memory. After a brief pause, a look of recognition and astonishment dawned on her face. Turning to Brent with her eyes blown wide open, she exclaimed, "Brent, is he that same Luo Luo Zheng you've been talking about?"</p>

  <p>She had never been outside of the Ethereal City, but she had heard of Luo Zheng's name no less than one thousand times!</p>

  <p>Ever since the end of the Martial Arts Contest, his name had been on Brent's lips. He had talked of him endlessly each time he returned home from the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Brent had deeply regretted not having been able to fight Luo Luo Zheng, and it was as if this lost chance haunted him to no end.</p>

  <p>Day by day, there were only more and more stories about Luo Luo Zheng? each one more extraordinary than the last. Word had spread around that he was even a greater talent than Brent in martial arts. Furthermore, he had enough mastery of the runes to have set up an impenetrable sect-protecting array that held off even the arrogant Eddie's attacks!</p>

  <p>People speculated that Luo Luo Zheng had far more superior rune skills over Arnold.</p>

  <p>Arnold was originally a disciple of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and so he had quickly gained attention and later on, great fame in the Ethereal City. In the south, people had erected a giant statue in his honor. Endless talk about this legendary figure resounded on the streets of the southern district, and his great achievements never failed to reach Xi Youqin's ears whenever she went there, and for good reason? the sect-protecting array that he had built protected the Ethereal Spirit Sect up to this day.</p>

  <p>However, here was a man who, according to rumors, possessed skills that surpassed even that of the legendary Arnold.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, such talk seemed incredulous to her. Words travelled quickly, and the stories that circulated were not always as close to the truth as they seemed. It was impossible that Luo Luo Zheng surpassed Brent's talent.</p>

  <p>After all, her younger brother had always been the most gifted disciple in the entire Central Region. His genius was a divine gift from the gods! It was only a matter of time before he reached the Soul Sea Realm. The Ethereal Spirit Sect had regarded him as its most valuable treasure! It was simply impossible that there existed a more talented person than her younger brother.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's skills did not stop at martial arts. He also showed promising potential as a runic expert. No one in the whole Central Region had ever displayed such skills and growth as him. What was even more unbelievable was that he had only been a mere youth, not even reaching 18 years of age at that time.</p>

  <p>Stories about him and his incredible feats only multiplied as time went by, and even Mu Ning, who rarely cared about the outside world, was filled with curiosity towards such a character. She had begun to think that if there was a chance, she would like to meet this Luo Luo Zheng and see just what kind of person he was. However, after his journey to the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, Luo Luo Zheng had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Brent himself, who had participated in the journey, presumed him dead.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had always regarded this as a pity. Now, she had lost all chances of ever meeting the man that her younger brother had endlessly talked about.</p>

  <p>She eyed him from head to toe as he stood before her in the flesh. He was most likely around 20 years of age, as he was only 18 years old two years ago. The man in front of her matched that description, but was he that same Luo Luo Zheng? Hadn't he died in the celestial tomb? How come he was here in their midst?</p>

  <p>Brent blinked his eyes at his sister and sighed. "Yes, sister, he's exactly that Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the reason of his appearance dawned on her. She now understood why Luo Luo Zheng had offered her two difficult choices. No one in the Central Region was unaware of the fate that had befallen Yan, his sister.</p>

  <p>Eddie had her in his grasp. Some of Xi Youqin's irritation slowly dissipated and was replaced by quiet respect as she realized that Luo Luo Zheng would stop at nothing to save his sister. He would sacrifice everything, if necessary.</p>
