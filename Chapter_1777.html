<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1777 Kurt's Gaze </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been worried and afraid that the ascending passageway might lead to the distant seas or to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had arrived at the Spirit Supreme Realm, crossing the vast ocean would take him many days. If the pursuers caught up before him, then he might not be able to rescue Ning Yudie in time.</p>

  <p>However, her being at the Divine Kingdom Continent made the situation much better.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! And remember we have to be one united force to fight against them!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng briefed Tianming and the others.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning cut short her trip to the Ethereal Spirit Sect and came back early. Although she held some grudges against Ning Yudie, she was more concerned about Luo Luo Zheng and knew her help would be required at this hour.</p>

  <p>At present, Xenia had already gone back to the Upper World under Master Feng's command, but Tianming, Mu Ning, Kurt and Lone were on standby, ready to make the move at Luo Zheng's command.</p>

  <p>And so they responded immediately when Luo Luo Zheng called out to them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Lawson and Nathan were filled with apprehension.</p>

  <p>After several days of recuperation, some of their bodily injuries had completely healed, some even disappeared. The effects of the divine medicine of Thoughtless Minds were incredibly powerful.</p>

  <p>Initially, they hesitated to follow the others. But after seeing Lucille and the other Godly Genius decide to follow, they changed their minds.</p>

  <p>But how could they be willing to work for Luo Luo Zheng, as they were not on good terms with him?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew about their feelings but did not give it much thought. He ordered his men to create a gap in the Light of Water to fly out.</p>

  <p>"Father! Please wait! I will also accompany you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian shouted as he came running out. Since he was unable to fly, he jumped around, waving his hand frantically.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, listen to me! You should stay back and take care of the people at Cloud Hall! Master Yu, please take him inside!" Luo Luo Zheng said gravely.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the Immortal Mansion was the safest place for Luo Nian. But looking at his spirit, Luo Luo Zheng realized he wouldn't be able to keep Luo Nian at the palace for too long. And right now, he only trusted Imogen to take care of Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Even though Imogen held her grudge against Luo Luo Zheng, she tried her best to pacify Luo Nian at the moment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swiftly turned into a streak of light and flew out, followed by Tianming, Mu Ning and Lone.</p>

  <p>Lucille was floating in front of Nathan and Lawson. She swept her gaze across them and asked, "Have you guys forgotten your patriarchs' instructions?"</p>

  <p>Nathan understood what Lucille was referring to, and retorted, "Humph, you should have supported me!"</p>

  <p>Lucille firmly shook her head. "I will only support the one who takes the first place. You lost it to him in the end. Deal with it!"</p>

  <p>"That was because I did not use my full strength," Nathan said bitterly. It was a sensitive topic for Nathan and he still showed his resentment about it. It was clear how unrecognized he had been at that time.</p>

  <p>"You still lost to him and that is what matters. Maybe even Luo Luo Zheng had not used his full strength!" Lucille said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>Nathan pursed his lips and let out a long sigh as he got up.</p>

  <p>Lawson shook his head, feeling equally miserable. Soon the three of the Thoughtless Minds followed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the other corner of the Cloud Hall, Lewis and Patrick were seen squatting by the side, staring at the light beams that flashed past the sky above them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng did not even acknowledge our presence!" Lewis's expression turned sour.</p>

  <p>"Didn't Tianming mention it before? Since the time Luo Luo Zheng had arrived at Cloud Hall, he was not in the mood to meet and greet guests. So obviously even you come under that list. He didn't have the time to meet everyone. I have a feeling there is an eminent danger lurking around the corner," Patrick said with a look of concern.</p>

  <p>"If there is danger we will definitely help him, but only when he asks us!" Lewis continued to be in a bad mood.</p>

  <p>Patrick gave a faint smile and said, "Look at those warriors! They have reached a higher level than the Soul Sea Realm. They are the warriors of the Spirit Supreme Realm, ever ready to protect us! You want to help them or trouble them?"</p>

  <p>Lewis pursed his lips and kept quiet. He wanted to refute Patrick's words, but he was right. Moreover, there was a huge difference between their strengths. How could he possibly help them? 'Maybe I can show them how to run for one's life!' he thought with a bitter laugh.</p>

  <p>Lewis's eyes were still fixed on the sky when he noticed one ray of light among the others suddenly stop. It was that of a young monk. He seemed to have sensed something and turned to directly look at them.</p>

  <p>It was nearly impossible to locate Lewis and Patrick as they were standing in a very remote corner. And yet the young monk saw them.</p>

  <p>Lewis found that to be a strange coincidence. He patted Patrick's shoulder and told him, "Look over there. Why is your companion looking at us?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'your companion'?" Patrick said with a look of distress.</p>

  <p>"What, you forgot? You are the reincarnation of a monk, just like him."</p>

  <p>Lewis chuckled.</p>

  <p>If he had told this to Tianming, Lewis would have been in great trouble.</p>

  <p>But Patrick had a very gentle personality and did not know to rebuke back.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that, but I have a feeling that monk is quite special,"</p>

  <p>Patrick stated, though he was also puzzled.</p>

  <p>The Buddhist sects in the Central Region were not flourishing well and few of them were only in the third-grade. Moreover, Cloud Hall's cultivation methods were not really suitable for Patrick to practice. What he did not know was that there was a famous Blessed Buddhist Land in the universe.</p>

  <p>The young monk who had stopped in midair was Kurt.</p>

  <p>Kurt was about to follow Luo Luo Zheng, when his heart began to beat strangely and a sense of intimacy rose within him. Curious, he turned his head and his gaze pulled towards Patrick.</p>

  <p>Kurt had a pensive look on his face. While Luo Luo Zheng and others departed, he thought the man he looked at would not leave Cloud Hall soon. He would first settle the matter for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the clear sky above the Central Region, eight figures soon turned into thin lines and quickly escaped into the distance.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's direction, they headed north.</p>

  <p>The speed of these eight people was unfathomable. They swiftly crossed the Central Region and entered the Chaotic Ocean of Stars in no time.</p>

  <p>Pausing for a brief moment, Luo Luo Zheng looked at the storm that was raging in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>If they were to pass through this storm, there was a high level of risk for Luo Luo Zheng and the others. At any cost, they had to avoid the core of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars if they had to be safe.</p>

  <p>"Do we have to directly cross over it? There must be some other way!"</p>

  <p>Lawson asked fearfully as he thought about their earlier experience.</p>

  <p>Earlier, to avoid the storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, the team of the Celestial Position had chosen a path on the back of the space.</p>

  <p>However, on their way through the back, they had a nasty encounter with the Shadow Race, also known as the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes to have a clear vision of the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>He could see that Ning Yudie had settled down in the Divine Kingdom Continent and was currently resting. She did not seem like she would leave immediately.</p>

  <p>He contemplated that there was still plenty of time.</p>

  <p>"This way!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng transformed himself into a beam of light and quickly advanced towards the northwest direction.</p>

  <p>Although the Chaotic Ocean of Stars looked terrifying, it was still possible to cross as long as one did not go near the core. They had to make a detour to avoid getting sucked into the powerful storm right at the center.</p>

  <p>Even though the detour would cost extra time, it was a much safer option.</p>

  <p>Back at the Divine Kingdom Continent, over a thousand core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place were living in the imperial palace.</p>

  <p>Most of the people focused on healing their wounds.</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race were not very strong with their fighting skills.</p>

  <p>The worrisome part was that after killing these creatures, their curse would still remain. Those damned little skulls would be like a nightmare that would wrap around a warrior until one died. There simply seemed to be no solution to get out of it.</p>
