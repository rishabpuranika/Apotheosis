<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was standing beside the Heaven Earth Board, exchanged gazes with Tianming and nodded slightly. He too was looking forward to the battle with Tianming.</p>

  <p>He could tell that the Tianming in front of him was very different from the Tianming he had known before. Tianming had changed completely, as if he had been reborn. Since Luo Zheng wasn't familiar with this side of Tianming, the outcome of their battle would be uncertain.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Zheng was thinking about another problem.</p>

  <p>If the evolution of the Heaven Earth Board symbolized the fate of the universe, what did Tianming defeating Xenia from the Celestial Position mean?</p>

  <p>Looking at the surface of the board now, Luo Zheng saw that all the stones were in complete chaos and each of the warriors had occupied a place of their own.</p>

  <p>This scene made Luo Zheng fall into deep thought.</p>

  <p>Many people in the universe were watching this game and deducing its outcome.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the big dragon that had been formed by the line of white stones had seemed unbreakable, like an iron rod.</p>

  <p>But not long after, the white stones, which had been the definite, had continuously made wrong moves, which had given the black stones, the variable, an opportunity to take advantage and fight back.</p>

  <p>As a result, the board was a mess. Whether it was the definite or the variable, they all occupied a small foothold. However, because of this, the game was in a deadlock.</p>

  <p>"This game represents the current state of affairs in the universe!"</p>

  <p>"As I see it, that giant dragon is referring to the humans of the past!"</p>

  <p>"That is quite possible! Humans are the only ones who are thriving like a big dragon. They have almost unified the entire universe!"</p>

  <p>Many powerful masters began to analyze the situation on the board based on their own understanding.</p>

  <p>In the early era of the universe, there had been a great war that had lasted hundreds of millions of years.</p>

  <p>During the war, all the races in the universe had formed alliances.</p>

  <p>In the end, the human race had emerged victorious.</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of Supreme Lord Salman, a new chapter began for the universe� the "golden age" of the human race!</p>

  <p>If humankind had continued to flourish, the other races in the universe wouldn't have had a chance to survive at all.</p>

  <p>However, 30 million years after the golden age had begun, there had been internal strife within the human race.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the human race wasn't as harmonious as it seemed to be. The oldest powers, the four great clans, had maintained their status as the ruling power of the human race, and each of them was equivalent to a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>But when conflict broke out, Supreme Lord Salman was killed, and the universe saw the rise of Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Supreme Lord of Oracle. The originally united human race split into three great powers: Humanity Alliance, Thoughtless Minds, and Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>This balance of power had been maintained until now.</p>

  <p>And because of the conflict among the three great powers, the speed of the human race's growth had slowed down. On the other hand, the Demon Night race and the ogre race were constantly on the rise.</p>

  <p>So, with this knowledge, it made sense for everyone watching to compare the huge dragon on the Heaven Earth board to the human race.</p>

  <p>Then, two more stones were placed on the board.</p>

  <p>The battles on the Heaven Earth Board continued...</p>

  <p>First came the battle between Karl and the ace talent of the Night Group, where the ace talent of the Night Group resisted a few attacks perfunctorily before admitting defeat.</p>

  <p>Then, there was a battle between Lawson and the ace talent of the ogre race, where the ace talent of the ogre race directly admitted defeat without fighting.</p>

  <p>Next was a battle between Lucille and the ace talent of the Humanity Alliance, where Lucille defeated her opponent in three moves and knocked the latter out.</p>

  <p>As the battles went on, the situation on the board became more and more complicated.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors standing on the stones gradually decreased as they were slowly eliminated.</p>

  <p>Although those who were wiped out were unwilling to accept the result, they did not leave empty-handed. After all, they still obtained a reward for strengthening their statues. Just this reward alone was already quite astonishing.</p>

  <p>Several hours later�</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was picked up by the fair-skinned hand. The hand placed the black stone under his feet onto the board.</p>

  <p>And right now, Luo Zheng was facing a knockout match!</p>

  <p>In normal battles, even if a warrior lost, the warrior wouldn't be eliminated; that was why many people directly admitted defeat in those battles.</p>

  <p>However, things were different in a knockout match. Since the risk of elimination loomed over both warriors, the fight would be fierce and it wouldn't end until one of them was wiped out. So naturally, any ace talent would attach great importance to a knockout match.</p>

  <p>"There's finally an elimination round. Who's my opponent?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was standing on the Heaven Earth Board, raised his head and gazed up at the sky.</p>

  <p>The fair-skinned hand reached out from the thick clouds again and moved toward the side where the white stones lay.</p>

  <p>When Nathan saw the hand move toward him, the corners of his mouth curved into a smile. His eyes looked expectant.</p>

  <p>"Is it my turn?"</p>

  <p>In Nathan's eyes, there were only two or three warriors who were qualified to be his opponents.</p>

  <p>Lawson was one of them. Before, Lawson and Nathan had been sent to the same supreme world and they had even fought once. However, Nathan had been unwittingly cheated by Lawson and his ranking, which had been the first, had immediately dropped. Ever since then, he'd held a grudge against Lawson. And he swore he would take revenge.</p>

  <p>Lucille was also a strong opponent for him. Even though this woman was only an ace talent, she used the One Soul in Two Bodies to cultivate the Five Elements Godly Way, so her abilities were not much weaker than that of a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>As for the third warrior...Nathan had always thought that it wouldn't be bad to have Luo Zheng as his opponent.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Luo Zheng was just a very lucky man who had ascended to the Upper World. His strength was only average. However, he had a woman like Mu Ning by his side. Moreover, he had a divine weapon, the Saint Killing Spear of the Demon Night, with him, and Nathan had no idea how Luo Zheng had obtained it. These things both intrigued and upset Nathan.</p>

  <p>Anyway, this would be a good opportunity for him to eliminate Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was powerful, but the spear skills that Luo Zheng had displayed were very ordinary. And anyway, the weapon that Luo Zheng usually used was not a spear.</p>

  <p>However, the fair-skinned hand descending from the sky passed through Nathan and landed behind him.</p>

  <p>Behind Nathan was a seemingly shy human girl.</p>

  <p>This woman was an old friend of Nathan, and she had a good relationship with Lucille as well. She was the ace talent of the Ji Clan where Janet came from� Cindy Ji.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Ji Clan that Cindy Ji belonged to had evolved from the Ji Clan that Lucille belonged to. In the earlier days, the two Ji Clans had belonged to the same family.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Thoughtless Minds was the strongest power of the human race.</p>

  <p>In the four great clans, there were two Godly Geniuses, Nathan and Lawson. Right after them, the strongest warriors were Lucille and Cindy Ji.</p>

  <p>Although these two women were only ace talents of their clans, the two clans they belonged to both had methods to cultivate the Godly Way, so their strength was comparable to that of Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>During the battle among the four great clans of the Thoughtless Minds, the elites of the younger generation of the four great clans had been ranked in terms of their strength. Nathan was in the first place, Lawson was ranked second, and Lucille was ranked third.</p>

  <p>Cindy Ji, who was slightly weaker than Lucille, was ranked fourth.</p>

  <p>"It's my turn..." Cindy Ji pursed her lips.</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous. Luo Zheng might have some ability, but he won't be a match for you." Lawson, who was on the other side, laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>The four great clans were in the same boat and had a good relationship with one another.</p>

  <p>They were well aware of Cindy Ji's personality. Although she was a shy and reserved woman who had no confidence in socializing with other people, her strength could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"That's right. This fellow only relies on the Saint Killing Spear. As far as I know, you've nothing to fear," Nathan added, smiling.</p>

  <p>"But�" Before Cindy Ji could finish her sentence, the fair-skinned hand grabbed the stone under her feet and placed it on the board.</p>

  <p>Cindy lifted the hem of her dress and bashfully stepped onto the board.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at this very moment, in the Ji Clan of the Thoughtless Minds, all of the members of the Ji Clan had focused their attention on Cindy Ji.</p>

  <p>"Cindy's opponent is actually Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"She's lucky. Although this Luo Zheng is quite powerful, he doesn't have the strength to contend with a Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>"He probably hasn't stepped into the Godly Way, but Cindy has already stepped halfway into the Dream Godly Way. Even if she were to just display the Emerald Dream, Luo Zheng would have no way to resist!"</p>

  <p>There was only one person in the Ji Clan who was still standing in the picture. Since the battle in front of them was a battle of elimination, they naturally had to pay close attention to it. Cindy Ji was their only hope.</p>

  <p>However, her opponent had turned out to be Luo Zheng, which they had never expected. Anyway, although they were surprised, they were confident that Cindy Ji would have no problem dealing with him.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of most people in the universe, Luo Zheng possessed the strength of an ace talent. Although he had instantly killed Norvin of the ogre race, he hadn't relied on his own strength to achieve that. He had merely relied on the strength of his weapon to win.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how powerful that Saint Killing Spear was, it shouldn't have much of an effect on Cindy Ji.</p>

  <p>As such, all the warriors in the Ji Clan were very optimistic about this fight.</p>

  <p>That was what everyone felt, except Janet, who was watching the scene with a frown on her face.</p>

  <p>Janet had not made it through the second stage, so she had left the Illusion Battlefield and returned to the Ji Clan. Now, she was watching the competition on the Heaven Earth Board with the rest of the members of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! Cindy's opponent is actually Luo Zheng�"</p>

  <p>Among all the members of the Ji Clan, Janet was the only person who knew Zheng's true strength. Since she had once fought in the Illusion Battlefield together with Luo Zheng, she knew that his strength was unfathomable.</p>
