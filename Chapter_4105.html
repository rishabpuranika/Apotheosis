<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4105 Reckless </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng had directly got into the body of the resentment-level Treacherous Being. He killed it instantly with the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>If not for his quick action, Luo Zheng and his companions would probably have all been killed on the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>Now these coral-shaped blood streaks had reappeared, and they actually formed a sword at Luo Zheng's will!</p>

  <p>"It's a basic Blood-controlling Method. If used on any other bloodlines, it wouldn't be very strong. I wonder how powerful the ancestry-level bloodline would be if this method is used on it?" Tearrag said, staring intently at the coral blood sword.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was feeling somewhat confused. "Master Terrag, may I ask you something? After one merges with a bloodline, one will naturally be able to display its token. What then is the use of this Blood-controlling Method?"</p>

  <p>Usually, after a warrior merged with a bloodline, its power would become the warrior's basic talent.</p>

  <p>For Eternal Realm warriors, such a Blood-controlling Method seemed unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Tearrag was not interested in these theories of the Human Spirit Sect, but he knew a lot about secret skills and theurgies. He snorted at the Primeval Lord of Heaven's question. Coldly, he said, "The Blood-controlling Method is the most basic use of the bloodlines, and it can also stimulate the bloodline to the limit. The Eternal Realm warriors in your system only make use of less than thirty percent of their bloodlines!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was stunned, so was the Snake Goddess, whose bright eyes widened at Tearrag's words.</p>

  <p>Was it true? The bloodline that they had always been proud of, which they had classified as the bloodline of the Eternal Realm, was only thirty percent activated?</p>

  <p>"Or maybe a bit more," Tearrag added.</p>

  <p>"But..." The Snake Goddess sounded unconvinced. "Why isn't there any Blood-controlling Method in the chaos?" she asked, looking directly at Tearrag.</p>

  <p>This simple question stumped him. For a moment he was silent, at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>He knew the Blood-controlling Method, but he didn't know how to build secondary worlds. He didn't even know why there was the need to build secondary worlds. He only knew that they could obtain energy from the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke up. "Could it be that one can only learn the Blood-controlling Method by becoming a member of the Four Spirits Sect?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>Tearrag nodded. "Yes. If those monkeys in the secondary worlds are smart enough, after joining our Monkey Spirit Sect, we will naturally teach them the Blood-controlling Method. Those in the secondary worlds are not qualified to learn the skill."</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed inwardly.</p>

  <p>They had only used thirty percent or less of the bloodline power they were proud of. The gap was bigger than they could have imagined.</p>

  <p>"Is the Blood-controlling Method only a skill of using bloodlines?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed to only have extracted his bloodline and converted it into a sword just now.</p>

  <p>This time, Tearrag shook his head. "Of course not. Different Blood-controlling Methods have different focuses. Most of them focus on bringing out the potential ability of one's own bloodline, but a small portion are concerned with the direct usage of the bloodline power. For example, the Blood-controlling Method of the Divine Flame Blood is to directly extract the blood and turn it into divine flames that can be wielded as a weapon against others."</p>

  <p>As he spoke of the Divine Flame Blood, a slight frown appeared on his face. It was the strongest and most outrageously powerful of the root-level bloodlines, yet it also caused terrible side effects.</p>

  <p>In the past, many members of the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect had inherited the Divine Flame Blood. If they fought in a battle using the Divine Flame Blood, they had to consume their own bloodline until they were completely drained, leading to their death.</p>

  <p>The Blood-controlling Method left on the stone tablet by Kincaid should be working in the similar way. It only made Luo Zheng extract the bloodline directly instead of strengthening the ability of his bloodline. After all, the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline were too complicated.</p>

  <p>"The power of the ancestry-level bloodline is quite extraordinary," said Tearrag. "For instance, Rodney? a member of the Human Spirit Sect? once used a drop of ancestry-level bloodline as a hidden weapon. When he injected it into his opponent's body, it caused his enemy to explode and die!"</p>

  <p>No living being could bear the power of the ancestry-level bloodline. If they came into contact with it, it caused an explosion, and they died. Thus, it was definitely one of the most powerful hidden weapons a warrior could use.</p>

  <p>However, the drop of ancestry-level bloodline that Rodney had tried hard to extract was eventually taken away by the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how powerful Luo Zheng's blood sword is," the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused.</p>

  <p>"We could try it on the Star Stones in the Ghost Mountain," the Snake Goddess proposed.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests of the Ghost Mountain also had their cultivation places. The Star Stones were very solid, and could be used to test the power of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"No need to go through all that trouble," said Tearrag, smirking. He pointed at his own chest. "Go on, stab me right now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. He and his companions looked at Tearrag as though he was insane, wondering if he was serious.</p>

  <p>They knew that Monkey Masters were famous for their bravery and recklessness, but this went beyond that. Tearrag was brave to the point of foolishness.</p>

  <p>But Tearrag ignored their stares. "Don't worry," he said in a tone of indifference. "You can't kill me as long as you don't use the Light of Annihilation, and if you do manage to kill me, I can revive in the Ghost Mountain. So hurry up! I want to see the power of your blood sword."</p>

  <p>"Master Tearrag, this blood sword is formed from the ancestry-level bloodline," Luo Zheng said slowly. "I don't know what special ability it would have..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng certainly had no intention of stabbing Tearrag with the coral blood sword.</p>

  <p>He had seen the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, and it was tremendous. There was nothing it could not dissolve.</p>

  <p>Although Treacherous Beings were powerful and seemingly indestructible, it was still possible for them to be killed.</p>

  <p>But Tearrag had no patience for Luo Zheng's hesitation. Even as Luo Zheng tried to dissuade him, he reached out and grabbed Luo Zheng's wrist. To everyone's shock, he pulled Luo Zheng's arm forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked astonished as Tearrag drove the sword into his chest.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the coral blood sword was embedded deeply in Tearrag's body.</p>

  <p>The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess watched the scene with expressions of disbelief.</p>

  <p>It was well known that these Monkey Masters were powerful figures, and they were also reputed to be frank and straightforward in their personality.</p>

  <p>But this was too much. Why had Tearrag dared to do such a thing? Was he truly insane?</p>

  <p>If there were more Monkey Masters like him in the Monkey Spirit Sect, then no wonder their sect was trapped on the small Night View Island for so long!</p>

  <p>"Master? Master Tearrag!" Luo Zheng spluttered, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"It's just a blood sword," Tearrag said calmly. "It's sharp and can break through my defense. It's power is quite impressive. But... but I..."</p>

  <p>In the instant after he stabbed himself, Tearrag had seemed unchanged, as though he didn't care about the sword buried in his body. But as he spoke, he suddenly trailed off, his voice taking on a strange tone.</p>

  <p>The moment the blood sword pierced Tearrag's chest, it had sent coral branches throughout the meridians of his body. Within seconds, they had spread out over his entire body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others gaped at Tearrag. The surface of his skin was covered with a net of fine red lines, and his body was growing stiffer and stiffer.</p>

  <p>He opened his mouth but was no longer able to speak, although his eyes remained wide open.</p>

  <p>There was an enormous boom.</p>

  <p>Tearrag's body had exploded.</p>

  <p>His body, in the form of a Treacherous Being, cracked along the lines of the red net on his skin. Chunks of his body flew in all directions, splattering all across the hall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Treacherous Being was not made of flesh and blood. If a normal body had disintegrated like this, the entire hall would be stained with gore.</p>

  <p>"Master Tearrag!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the real Snake Goddess gazed around them at the pieces of Tearrag's body, wearing looks of helplessness and anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to find other Monkey Masters for help!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>These Monkey Masters were all elites in the Monkey Spirit Sect. They had to explain what had happened, so no one would think that a Monkey Master had been killed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were startled when a familiar voice suddenly spoke.</p>

  <p>"No need for that," said Tearrag.</p>

  <p>The pieces scattered across the hall began to wriggle towards each other.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, they had all joined together to reform Tearrag's body.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Treacherous Beings were truly terrifying. Their bodies were flexible and virtually indestructible. Even a Treacherous Being who had been cut into thousands of pieces, like Tearrag, could regenerate almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Of course, if Luo Zheng had used the Light of Annihilation, the result might be different.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven heaved a deep sigh of relief upon seeing that Tearrag had completely recovered.</p>

  <p>Tearrag came up to Luo Zheng and studied his coral blood sword closely. There was a trace of envy in his eyes.</p>

  <p>So, the most basic Blood-controlling Method could actually achieve such power. How terrifying would it be if all the potential of the ancestry-level bloodline in Luo Zheng's body was brought out fully?</p>
