<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just after the woman got rid of Nicholas, a bright halo shot toward her from the side, cutting through seven to eight layers of ice in the process.</p>

  <p>Pieces of ice flew and shrouded her head, causing her to turn her attention to the side.</p>

  <p>Noticing the incoming halo, the woman frowned and tapped the ground lightly with her toes. The ice beneath her feet immediately cracked open.</p>

  <p>As she fell through the hole, she managed to avoid the halo.</p>

  <p>"Alas! She was almost killed!"</p>

  <p>"Nicholas said that she can't fight back now, so we must take this opportunity to kill her!"</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me! I will shoot her to death!"</p>

  <p>Although the woman had managed to avoid the halo, she had no time to rest; she felt some powerful internal momentum gathering overhead.</p>

  <p>Even though the Holy Beings' methods were powerful enough to shock heaven and earth, she could deal with them.</p>

  <p>However, it was really not convenient for her to fight back now. If the formless creatures were interrupted during the process of cloning, the Faith Energy that she had provided before would be wasted.</p>

  <p>So now, she had to carefully protect the mark in her hands while dodging the attacks of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Zoom!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a few crimson arrows shot toward her from above.</p>

  <p>The arrows, which contained a strong killing intent, were Blood Boiling Arrows created by the Murdering Godly Way.</p>

  <p>If ordinary people were hit by the arrow, their blood would boil and they would definitely die.</p>

  <p>The woman once again tapped the ground lightly with her toes and turned her body, skillfully avoiding the arrows.</p>

  <p>But after hearing Nicholas's order, the Holy Beings were not going to let her go that easily.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!" a bold and wild voice said.</p>

  <p>Then, a tricolor ball of fire burst forth.</p>

  <p>Suppressed by the black mist, the ball of fire quickly sank into the darkness.</p>

  <p>But the moment the ball of fire lit up, everyone knew that it must be from Clark.</p>

  <p>Although the crowd could not see the flames, they knew from the heat they felt that the tricolor Sacred Twilight Flame was still burning.</p>

  <p>The truth was, Clark was afraid of this woman as he had suffered a great loss to her before.</p>

  <p>But now that she was just dodging everyone's attacks, it was the perfect chance for him to vent his anger. As a Holy Being who had been defeated, he would naturally return the favor.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As Clark swirled his right hand around, the tricolor Sacred Twilight Flame charged directly at the woman.</p>

  <p>There was a slight shift in her expression, and then suddenly, the sound of long swords came roaring from the darkness behind her.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>Seven or eight rays of sword radiance formed a huge net whistling toward Clark.</p>

  <p>Reacting quickly, Clark lowered his head and squeezed through the huge net formed by the sword radiance, after which the net suddenly snapped close. If he had gotten caught in the net, he would have been chopped into pieces.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way? Is it Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Sensing the great power of the net formed by the sword radiance with his spiritual sense, Clark withdrew his fist and retreated.</p>

  <p>A figure stood in front of him in the darkness.</p>

  <p>'This man isn't Zheng. It's the guy from the Sea of Meditation!' thought Samuel, who had been silent all this while. His eyes gleamed as he recalled the scent of the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>It was this guy who had saved Zheng. Now that he had appeared here, where was Zheng?</p>

  <p>What Samuel did not know was that this dark figure was not the real Sword Chen, but another phantom that a formless creature had cloned for the woman.</p>

  <p>This phantom had been staying in the ice palace for many years.</p>

  <p>Now that the woman was in trouble, she had ordered it to come here as fast as it could.</p>

  <p>The moment Clark stepped back, all the other Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings started to attack the woman as well.</p>

  <p>"Water Rhyme Sword!"</p>

  <p>"Shocking Thunder!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Although the phantom had its own thoughts and personality, it was completely submissive to the woman.</p>

  <p>With its cultivation base as a Demi-holy Being, fighting against so many Holy Beings was like a moth darting into the fire, but it did not intend to retreat. It gently pulled its sword, and all the swords inserted at the bottom of the Sea of Meditation began to vibrate madly.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen could use the force of primitive fear, and so could this phantom.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The phantom activated its own strength to the maximum.</p>

  <p>As it wildly waved the long sword in its hand, thick sharp rays of sword radiance slashed in all directions.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way and the force of primitive fear maximized its strength. Now, it was powerful enough to fight against Holy Beings like Samuel.</p>

  <p>With its sword radiance, it avoided the fatal attacks of several Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Why is this guy so powerful? He's just a Demi-holy Being!"</p>

  <p>"Even if he practices the forbidden Godly Way, he can't be so powerful."</p>

  <p>"No matter how strong he is, he's on his own. Kill him!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings present were quite surprised. They had not expected that a Demi-holy Being who had suddenly rushed out could be so strong.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how powerful he was, he had to have his limits.</p>

  <p>Even a man as powerful as Nicholas could not defeat so many Holy Beings at the same time.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>All sorts of attacks came down from the ice above into the darkness.</p>

  <p>However, the phantom of Sword Chen was determined to protect the woman and did not plan to retreat. Standing on the broken ice, it fought back with all its strength.</p>

  <p>The aftermath of the attacks of the Holy Beings destroyed the center of the ice palace, forming a hole of tens of thousands of feet wide.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings fought together and finally killed the phantom of Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"Now that we killed this Demi-holy Being, it's her turn to die," Zeke said coldly in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"The woman hasn't run away," a Demi-holy Being remarked with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, the woman should have tried her best to run away while the phantom of Sword Chen had been fighting off all the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, she remained at the same place she had been, standing still outside a broken ice layer beneath the hole. She gently put down her hands with a smile on her face. As she waved her hand, the formless creatures in the darkness began to gather behind her.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad for her. Let's kill her!"</p>

  <p>One of the Holy Beings attacked first. A streak of light swept across the darkness, heading for the woman with a whistling sound.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, another figure appeared behind the woman.</p>

  <p>This person had a powerful aura and was emitting a unique Truth of Godly Way— the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos. All the people at the upper part of the ice palace were shocked to feel the aura. Obviously, it was Nicholas's aura.</p>

  <p>The real Nicholas, however, was still dealing with the Devils. The force of primitive fear that the Devils used was far more powerful than he had expected it to be.</p>

  <p>As he fought, he kept trying to think of a way to break through.</p>

  <p>Since the Devils did not have concrete bodies, Nicholas racked his brains about how to hurt them.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he sensed a familiar aura from below. It was his own aura.</p>
