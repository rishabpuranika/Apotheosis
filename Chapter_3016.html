<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Laura gently waved her hand, bubbles containing the soul pills floated towards the three warriors.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the soul pill, he touched the bubble with his finger and it instantly burst.</p>

  <p>The fist-sized brown soul pill turned into a wisp of brown smoke and went straight into Zheng's head and entered his soul.</p>

  <p>"Once your Soul of Light enters the Sea of Truth, the soul pill can also enter it," Laura explained flatly.</p>

  <p>When Elgin and Beldene got the soul pills, they couldn't wait to return to the platforms and sit there cross-legged. As the strong Truth of Eternal Sword Intent emitted from them, their Souls of Light entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>All the True Gods in the Source World had a strong desire to enter the Sea of Truth. They could get a fresh start only after crossing this sea.</p>

  <p>Zheng also flew to the platform of the Sword Dance Palace and sat down there with his legs crossed.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace members would take some time to get there and take him away, so he planned to spend that period of time crossing the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>But at this time, he wouldn't be able to enter the Sea of Truth with his physical body, as it would easily expose him.</p>

  <p>Zheng had learned from No. 9527 that the Oneness Sky Palace members were also human beings but he was unwilling to reveal some of his secrets to others.</p>

  <p>Zheng started to meditate and summon the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light was sucked in by the Truth of Godly Way, and it entered the Sea of Truth in an instant.</p>

  <p>Atop a palace, Dorothy sat on the edge of a corner with her legs dangling.</p>

  <p>A beautiful woman walked under the palace and looked up to Dorothy with a smile. "Dorothy, I heard that Ralf has crossed five lines."</p>

  <p>Dorothy's lips curled up. "So what?"</p>

  <p>"Actually, you can cross the Sea of Truth by yourself. Once the young man enters the Sea of Truth, you can turn back to look for him and travel along with him. There's no need to be so stubborn," the beautiful woman rebuked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head and said, "Aunt Felicity, you know me well. I assure you I'll keep my promise and wait for him."</p>

  <p>Felicity responded, "But now you have fallen behind others."</p>

  <p>"I don't care. Besides, they are not too far from me. Ralf and others always move slowly, so as long as I give it my best, I'm sure I can overtake them!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy uttered.</p>

  <p>Felicity sighed. Dorothy was very talented, but she was obstinate.</p>

  <p>It was definitely rare to meet a person, who had explored the Sea of Truth with his physical body.</p>

  <p>But that man hadn't showed up for a long time since the last time. Who knew what had happened?</p>

  <p>Passing through the Sea of Truth using one's corporeal body was not allowed. Maybe he had been rejected and eliminated by the truth.</p>

  <p>The truth was inviolable, so how could anyone cross the Sea of Truth only with their physical body?</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, a small sword that hung on Dorothy's waist slightly vibrated. Dorothy's expression changed suddenly.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and got down from the eaves with a graceful somersault. She gently kicked off the roof and shot down to the ground like an arrow.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Felicity, guard the palace. That guy appeared," Dorothy ordered.</p>

  <p>"He has finally appeared?" Felicity shook her head at Dorothy's excitement.</p>

  <p>In fact, even the palace leader was paying great attention to the young man.</p>

  <p>It was said that this matter had spread in the Oneness Sky Palace, and the elders in the palace had also ordered the disciples to wander near the first line, hoping to find the young man.</p>

  <p>Of course, Felicity knew that the clue was in Dorothy's hands, but she was never going to reveal that to the elders...</p>

  <p>Dorothy sat cross legged, quickly emitting the Truth of Godly Way. In the blink of an eye, she stepped into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>A boat emanating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was quietly built on the Sea of Truth. Dorothy's figure also appeared on this boat. Her eyes darted around the sea, but she didn't spot Zheng's boat!</p>

  <p>"It's impossible! How could he disappear in such a short time? Did he leave the Sea of Truth once again?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy pouted in anger and disappointment.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone spoke calmly from behind, "Are you looking for me?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy turned her head and saw Zheng's Truth Boat quietly floating behind her.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so late?" Dorothy was pleasantly surprised, but her tone was accusatory.</p>

  <p>She had wasted a lot of time waiting for Zheng.</p>

  <p>As someone in such a high position, she was among the peerless talents in the Oneness Sky Palace all the time, so she was under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry but I have encountered some trouble," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>Zheng was busy all the time, be it in the divine land, the Source World, the Gracious Province or the Sword Light Palace, and did not have much time to enter the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"What? You have cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature, haven't you?</p>

  <p>Why does the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent get mixed with it?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy wasn't angry with Zheng anymore. She quickly discovered that something was wrong with him.</p>

  <p>A trace of a sharp aura emanated from Zheng's Truth Boat. This was the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, which was most familiar to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>She had also found a theurgy of the Truth of Cultivation Nature for Zheng. It had only been one year, but Zheng had grasped another Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"I have indeed comprehended it only recently," Zheng agreed with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Really? You have just cultivated it recently?" Dorothy's eyebrows shot up.</p>

  <p>"The comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way can't be accomplished in a short time, and you did it. Also, it's extremely difficult to cultivate two Truths of Godly Ways..."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to waste any more time on this matter, so he changed the subject. "I can't cross the Sea of Truth in a short time even with the two Truths of Godly Ways. We'd better set out as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy was slightly suspicious but still followed Zheng. The two Truth Boats started to move in the vast sea again.</p>

  <p>A cyan green boundary wall separated the Gracious Province from the Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>At this time, a crack appeared on the Gracious Province's land.</p>

  <p>A mysterious green vine shot out from the crack.</p>

  <p>The shape of the vine was special. The leaves at the tip of the vine were like the toes of a gecko. The leaves crawled along the ground and clung to the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The toe-like leaves slammed onto the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>A light flashed on the boundary wall, and a golden Sanskrit word appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>Another golden Sanskrit word also appeared in the middle of the leaves.</p>

  <p>Then the leaves covered the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Since the two Sanskrit words couldn't be matched, the boundary wall didn't open.</p>

  <p>However, the Sanskrit word kept changing and adjusting on the leaves.</p>

  <p>After five or six attempts, a faint Sanskrit word finally matched the one on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>After obtaining recognition on the boundary wall, thousands of cracks appeared on the ground beneath the wall and countless Man-eating Demon Flowers emerged from the ground.</p>

  <p>These Man-eating Demon Flowers were unable to move themselves, so they were living on an extremely huge vine now! And this vine itself was tens of thousands of miles in length!</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The earth split open, and the fissure extended tens of thousands of miles, and even the entire Gracious Province shook.</p>

  <p>Following closely behind these Man-eating Demon Flowers was the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers, which was the tallest one!</p>

  <p>Then a wild and violent aura enveloped the area within a million-mile radius.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flowers were poised to go through the boundary wall and invade the Seven-Star Province!</p>
