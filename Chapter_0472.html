  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Sir, I don't quite understand yet. If my sister is so important to Cloud Hall, why was she sent to Hell Mountain? Was it because of her great potential?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Kenneth nodded but after a moment, also shook his head. With another defeated sigh, he continued,"Not just that. Apart from her aptitude in martial arts, she was gifted with a special peculiarity. Her body is suitable for energy storing. She has what is called the 'Purple Power Body'."</p>

  <p>"Purple Power Body?" asked Zheng with an arched brow.</p>

  <p>He had never heard of such a thing.</p>

  <p>"You heard me right. It's a special natural talent passed on by blood, inherited only by women. And when a woman of Purple Power Body enters the Internal Elixir Realm, her Internal Elixir is called the Purple Power Elixir— very different from the usual ones, and more powerful than that of common people. A woman with Purple Power in the Internal Elixir stage is someone far beyond her peers of both genders," explained Kenneth.</p>

  <p>"I see…My sister is a remarkable woman, it seems. Do you mean someone is coveting her natural talent?</p>

  <p>Can this Purple Power Body be taken by force?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, he felt that he was finally close to the truth.</p>

  <p>"Such a special talent is extremely rare— one in a trillion. And as only women can possess this particular skill..." Kenneth's countenance was severely serious as he continued,"There is one thing that can be taken from them— their virginity.</p>

  <p>There's this overlord of the Central Region who wants to set out a Lustful Demon Array. To do so, he needs to find three women who have the Purple Power Body and they all have to be in the stage of the Internal Elixir Realm."</p>

  <p>Virginity and lust…</p>

  <p>As Zheng heard the pair of words, his face turned darker and more furious.</p>

  <p>Unlike normal cultivation methods, there were also evil techniques for one to refine the self and gain inner energy. These evil methods required the practitioners to practice evil deeds, and some had to be acquired through sex with virgins.</p>

  <p>Apparently, this overlord of the Central Region was one of those who used such evil means. His goal wasn't a common one, for he required the virginity of three Purple Power Bodies of the Internal Elixir Realm. One could hardly imagine how powerful this overlord must have been.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that the Purple Power Body was extremely rare, possessed by only one in a trillion? And he wants three? How is that possible?" questioned Zheng. However powerful this overlord might have been, his pursuit seemed to be in vain. The Purple Power Body was so rare that only one woman out of hundreds of millions possessed it and yet the overlord wanted to find three of them. What was more, he needed all of them to be in the Internal Elixir stage. How could that be?</p>

  <p>With a shake of his head, Kenneth slowly said,"I have no idea. These matters are far too high up for me to fathom. Three Purple Power Bodies of the Internal Elixir stage sound impossible to find but some masters in the Central Region have unimaginable means to get what they want.</p>

  <p>With their superhuman skills, they know everything that's happening between Heaven and Earth. There is a possibility that they might find three women that match the criteria eventually, and that's why we sent Yan to Hell Mountain. Practice or punishment— it's merely an excuse.</p>

  <p>Yan's imprisonment is truly for protection. We are trying to protect her from this overlord and from all the others who would use her."</p>

  <p>Now, it all made sense. It was no wonder his sister had been confined— a mission of protection disguised in punishment.</p>

  <p>Though he could finally sigh in relief, sadness built up inside Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was all his fault, he believed, being too weak to protect his own sister.</p>

  <p>Once her true nature was exposed to the public, Zheng couldn't even imagine what would happen to her.</p>

  <p>After everything, he knew that he owed Kenneth an apology. Cloud Hall had done all they could to protect his beloved Yan.</p>

  <p>But there was another question that still hung over his head— was this overlord within the authority of Cloud Hall or from the other forces of the Central Region?</p>

  <p>Irritated at the situation, Zheng contemplated on the matter.</p>

  <p>In spite of his anger, he was no fool. For the whole time he spoke, Kenneth sounded sincere in his authority. But he didn't owe Zheng an explanation. After all, Kenneth was a senior member of Cloud Hall and would do things in Cloud Hall's interest. If the overlord was also a member of Cloud Hall, Kenneth would never stand against him for Yan's sake.</p>

  <p>If that were the case, they could no longer rely on Kenneth's kindness.</p>

  <p>'Time, ' Zheng suddenly thought. 'I need time to improve and become stronger, ' he swore deep inside. 'For Yan's sake…and my own sake…I must become stronger. The sooner I do, the better.'</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to arrange a meeting with my sister?"</p>

  <p>After a thought, Zheng suddenly inquired.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Kenneth nodded his head and promised,"Of course you can visit her. You're also allowed to bring her out of Hell Mountain for a while, but not too long. The overlord already knows about Yan's talents and has paid quite a few visits to Cloud Sect. To protect Yan, we lied to him and said she was still in her confinement. If he happens to spot her outside of Hell Mountain, we'd be exposed. All of us, especially Yan, would be in severe trouble."</p>

  <p>"I understand. Thank you for your advice, Sir. I'll go meet her now," he calmly said.</p>

  <p>After the fierce struggle inside him, he restrained his anger and excitement. Too much caring and overthinking might lead to confusion when dealing with problems in the long term. Hearing about Yan's situation, Zheng decided to keep his mind even. What he needed now wasn't to vent his anger but to find a solution to the problem.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xu, take Zheng to Hell Mountain," ordered Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Following the command, Elder Xu summoned his transportation vehicle.</p>

  <p>An emerald green leaf of five square feet appeared beneath his boots.</p>

  <p>Urging Zheng on, Elder Xu told him,"Stand on the leaf, Zheng. I'll take you to Hell Mountain."</p>

  <p>After bowing his head to Kenneth, Zheng stepped on the leaf. Once he steadied himself, the leaf fluttered up and shot right up into the air.</p>

  <p>The thought of seeing his sister made Zheng's heart race in excitement— he could barely keep it in, now.</p>
