<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 923 The Core Area </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Malcom had finished speaking, he took a black fruit from his space ring. With a gentle pinch of his fan-like hand, the fruit was instantly crushed.</p>

  <p>A black smoke emerged from the fruit and started to swirl around him.</p>

  <p>"Five months ago, I said that I'd kill you, Luo Luo Zheng! Today, you will surely die here!" The black smoke continued to gather around him and turned into a huge pair of black wings which seemed to have sprouted from his back.</p>

  <p>Seeing those large black wings spread out, both Xun and Yolande frowned at the same time.</p>

  <p>"The ogres have actually obtained that guy's inheritance," Xun said with a cold expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could feel that the pair of black wings was extraordinary, but even with his growing experience, he still could not recognize what it was.</p>

  <p>"This is the fruit of the Dark Sky Mage," Yolande clarified.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Sky Mage?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"It's just that his name was Dark Sky Mage and he was a being similar to a world lord. He possessed the strength of a world lord, but he didn't actually control a world. Probably, he was equivalent to the existence of an independent warrior of the Central Region," Xun explained.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of this fruit?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"As you can see, the fruit can greatly increase his strength within a short period of time."</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head and whispered to Luo Luo Zheng, "Get ready to run!"</p>

  <p>The vision and perceptions of both Xun and Yolande were far beyond those of Luo Luo Zheng, Esther, and the other warriors of the Lower World. At the beginning, Xun had not proposed that they escape, instead she had determined that both sides still had the strength to fight. Even though Malcom was a war sage, they could still oppose him.</p>

  <p>Esther and the other two top-level war lords of the Demon Night were capable of dealing with Rehaan and the three other top-level war lords of the Night Group. What Luo Luo Zheng and the others needed to do was stall Malcom.</p>

  <p>Once Esther and her companions finished off their opponents, they could join forces with Luo Luo Zheng and his companions. Malcom would probably not be able to win against them all.</p>

  <p>But Xun hadn't expected that Malcom actually had the fruit of the Dark Sky Mage. In reality, the fruit could not only stimulate the potential of one's body, but could also enable one to use a kind of secret technique. As to whether or not Malcom possessed this secret technique, it would all depend on whether or not the ogres had obtained the complete inheritance of the Dark Sky Mage.</p>

  <p>With both hands on the spear, Xun raised it and thrust it toward Malcom. An invisible and deadly wave was about to pierce through him.</p>

  <p>"Go!" Of course, Xun didn't think for even a moment that her attack would be able to kill Malcom. The only thing she could hope to gain would be time? time for Luo Luo Zheng to retreat.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't flaunt his true strength at such a critical time. As soon as Xun finished speaking, he shot backwards like a flying arrow.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Esther was leading the two top-level war lords of the Demon Night to force back Rehaan and the three top-level war lords of the Night Group in a fierce battle. The members of the Demon Night were much stronger than the members of the other races. Although Rehaan had been cultivating in the secret passageway, it was a pity he did not break through to become a war sage. His strength had not improved much. As for the other three, although they were also top-level war lords, they were not that experienced at hand-to-hand combat. Their strengths lay in sneak attack. They were not Esther's match at all.</p>

  <p>Esther was constantly oppressing Rehaan. However, after hearing Xun's order, she immediately gave up on the idea of attacking. To her, Xun's order was the supreme imperial edict.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The three top-level war lords of the Demon Night immediately turned into streaks of light and followed behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape!" A cold smile appeared on Malcom's face.</p>

  <p>After he dodged the spear, the pair of black wings behind him suddenly flapped. His speed was astonishingly fast, and like the whirlwind his winged figure chased after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The humiliation which he had suffered in the Tower of Sin and the grievances which he had endured these past few months were continuously being released from within Malcom's heart. At this moment, he actually wished that the game would last longer. He was enjoying this game of cat and mouse!</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Let's catch up to them." Rehaan led the three members of the Night Group and followed behind them.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Night Group secretly rolled their eyes.</p>

  <p>In fact, Shane really wanted to tell Rehaan that the three of them had already completed their mission by having led Malcom to Luo Luo Zheng, and that it was Malcom and Rehaan's task to kill Luo Luo Zheng. Shane didn't want to stay in this damned place any longer. He had been chased by these monsters for such a long way, and he had almost lost his life!</p>

  <p>However, Shane could only think of it in his heart, and if he dared to say it aloud, the result would probably end up being him slaughtered on the spot.</p>

  <p>Not to mention, in this situation, they didn't have the guts to go out the way they had come by themselves. They didn't dare to face the monsters alone!</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape, Luo Luo Zheng. You should just capitulate and surrender to me. I can make your death a bit more comfortable!" Malcom laughed out loud behind him.</p>

  <p>His speed was extremely fast, and the distance between him and Luo Luo Zheng was constantly closing. It seemed that he was about to launch his final attack on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes flashed as she galloped along behind Luo Luo Zheng. She suddenly stopped on the spot and her long spear danced wildly. The spear suddenly shot out and a formless ripple swiftly enveloped Malcom, momentarily stopping his pursuit of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your spear skills are indeed powerful. It is truly surprising. With your strength, you are actually able to unleash such extreme power. What a pity!</p>

  <p>It's still useless!" Malcom brandished the battle blade in his hand. Having devoured the black fruit, he was much more powerful than he used to be.</p>

  <p>Just a single blade strike broke apart Xun's spear attack. Not only that, but that blade's energy didn't weaken at all, and it continued cutting towards Xun's body.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, die!"</p>

  <p>The blade's Mu Ning instantly slashed into her chest, immediately shattering her tall body.</p>

  <p>Xun was indeed struck to death by Malcom. However, she was a sword spirit and her body was formed from the sword spirit's power. Even if she was cut to death, she wouldn't receive any fatal injuries.</p>

  <p>Xun transformed into numerous light spots wrapping around the long spear and spiraled towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Soon, the light spots gathered together and Xun materialized again.</p>

  <p>She raised the long spear and charged towards Malcom once more. The spear was still terrifying and its power fluctuations made her opponent's heart palpitate.</p>

  <p>Xun's attack was very fierce. Although Malcom's strength had increased greatly, he had no choice but to stop and deal with it. This required a serious manner. Otherwise, if he was stabbed by that spear, he would still die.</p>

  <p>Malcom once again slashed out with his blade, causing Xun's body to be torn into pieces. But in the blink of an eye, she had returned again, completely unscathed, and continued thrusting out with her spear.</p>

  <p>Malcom soon realized that he couldn't go on like this.</p>

  <p>His flying speed was indeed much faster than Luo Zheng's. However, this sword spirit was proving simply indestructible. The distance between him and Luo Luo Zheng had not shortened at all due to her constant interference.</p>

  <p>What enraged Malcom even more was that Luo Luo Zheng and his companions were running so fast ahead of him, while Rehaan, Shane and the others behind them couldn't even keep up. The further they ran, the more distance they had on him. Malcom knew that he didn't even have someone to help him.</p>

  <p>However, he had finally found Luo Luo Zheng. How could he be willing to give up?</p>

  <p>He also did not believe that Xun could continue fighting like this forever.</p>

  <p>The sword spirit that was attached to Luo Luo Zheng was, in theory, an indestructible presence. As long as Luo Luo Zheng didn't die, she wouldn't disappear or perish.</p>

  <p>However, she was constantly being destroyed by Malcom and she had to materialize again and again. This was rather energy-consuming. The red light emitted by the sword spirit was dimming. If the energy of the sword spirit was consumed beyond a certain extent, she would only recover after slowly nurturing herself within Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The situation now looked bleak for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Esther, Fabian, Jarrod, and the others were also trying to think of a way to get rid of Malcom. Running away without offering any resistance did not mean that they had given up. For them, being chased by Malcom was also not going to be a good thing.</p>

  <p>During the chase, both sides continued to move forward. Ten miles, a hundred miles, two hundred miles...</p>

  <p>At this point, everyone slowly realized that something was wrong with the scene ahead of them.</p>

  <p>After they had previously entered the inner area, the surrounding scenery had slowly lost its color. But now, the surrounding landscape seemed to have disappeared. Around them there was only black ground now, while the trees, grasses, mountains, and the other things had vanished.</p>

  <p>"A fog is rising. The fog is starting to form around the area," Luo Luo Zheng suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"Fog?" Esther's expression suddenly changed when she heard Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Even though she had just experienced thirteen cycles of reincarnation, her heart couldn't help but tighten right now.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod looked up, and said in unison, "I don't see any fog..."</p>

  <p>Yolande said affirmatively, "There is indeed fog, but it's still very thin!"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I'm afraid... I'm afraid that we've entered the core area!" Esther's face sank, and her body abruptly came to a stop.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, the surrounding fog thickened. Even Fabian and the others could see a layer of faint fog slowly floating up. This fog was quickly becoming thick enough to be seen.</p>

  <p>As soon as they stopped, Malcom came over to them. At the same time, he said with a sneer, "Why aren't you running anymore?"</p>
