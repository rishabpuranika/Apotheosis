  <p>
</p>

  <p>As things escalated to this point, realization dawned on the faces of Dale, the Snake Goddess, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven as well.</p>

  <p>It turned out that Luo Zheng had cultivated the Soul Sea Realm anew.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior had reached the Soul Sea Realm, their life vitality became liquefied and formed a Soul Sea. Afterward, the sea of life vitality in their inner world would regularly provide life vitality for the warrior.</p>

  <p>After all, even if one had mastered the Divine Dao, they still used the life vitality in essence.</p>

  <p>Currently, the power Luo Zheng had used to reconstruct his inner world directly came from the ancestry-level bloodline. The difference was self-evident.</p>

  <p>For instance, the world created by using life vitality was secondary in one's body.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the world created by using chaotic energy was chaos.</p>

  <p>Therefore, was the world created using the ancestry-level bloodline the Abstruse Energy World?</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's heart skipped a beat at the thought, and he quietly glanced at Dale beside him.</p>

  <p>Dale acted like he was only a messenger and didn't know anything else, but was that really the case?</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had no idea what time and space in the Abstruse Energy World were like. The creation of the world before his eyes was still fresh in his mind, which contradicted his assumption.</p>

  <p>Thus, he ignored his confusion and did not say anything.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's inner world evolved at an even faster speed.</p>

  <p>Earth continued to emerge from the sea, and volcanoes erupted destructive hot lava.</p>

  <p>The seawater extinguished the lava that came to destroy everything, then an area in the shape of a coiled snake was formed. Lastly, life began to take shape in the place.</p>

  <p>It was a kind of bright green seaweed, and everyone was sure those were just plants.</p>

  <p>Yet, the thumb-sized plants quickly grew wings that were as thin as a cicada's and flew away.</p>

  <p>Then, hundreds of millions of those "seaweed creatures" flew up the sky towards the continents that Luo Zheng had created before.</p>

  <p>From afar, the mass of seaweed creatures looked like an enormous green hurricane.</p>

  <p>"What do they want to do?" the Snake Goddess said worriedly.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look!" Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>Since he had lost the ability to know everything in his inner world, he could not move freely as before. He could not appear anywhere in his inner world with just a thought like he previously did.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the restrictive force of the Space Law in this world was not strong, so they could still teleport at will.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Dale arrived at the edge of the continents.</p>

  <p>The green seaweed creatures swarmed the continents, then attacked the creatures that lived there!</p>

  <p>Although the seaweed creatures were small, they were highly poisonous.</p>

  <p>All the creatures that they touched died in an instant!</p>

  <p>"These green seaweeds... They are attacking the world I created!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened at the sight of the seaweed creatures that swarmed the continents like locusts.</p>

  <p>He had painstakingly built and developed these continents, and he would never allow anyone to destroy them, especially when his inner world had just gotten rebuilt. How could he allow these seaweed creatures to slaughter the living beings that lived on them?</p>

  <p>"We have to stop these seaweeds!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>As he had lost the almighty power in his inner world, it was not easy to remove all of the green seaweeds. Only the other three who tagged along could help him.</p>

  <p>"Clean them up."</p>

  <p>"I'll activate the enchanted barrier!"</p>

  <p>"These seaweed creatures are quite weak, and they only came in large numbers. It's not a big deal to finish them..."</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Dale were about to make a move, Luo Zheng suddenly waved his hands and said, "No need.</p>

  <p>Let me deal with them!"</p>

  <p>Then, he gently raised his hand.</p>

  <p>A strong gust of wind blew across the continents, which stirred the endless sand into the air.</p>

  <p>"Kill them all!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, the sand in the sky changed course and flew towards the seaweed creatures.</p>

  <p>Each grain of sand pierced through a seaweed creature, and not long after, the numerous grains of sand had silently punctured millions of seaweed creatures.</p>

  <p>Only the master of the inner world could perform such a precise attack.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned to the continents, he found his omniscient abilities had recovered.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the sand had completely wiped out all the seaweeds that surrounded the continents.</p>

  <p>However, their relief was short-lived: the seaweeds kept emerging from the seawater and swarmed the continents again. Furthermore, the number of seaweed now multiplied up to a hundred times more than that of the previous batch!</p>

  <p>"No matter what reason you have to attack my world, if you don't stop, I will never forgive you!" Luo Zheng screamed as he looked up at the sky in despair.</p>

  <p>In many cases, he was no match for the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>But now that he had regained his omniscient and omnipotent powers, he could now compete against it.</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, a faint sound came from the red mist that shrouded the sky.</p>

  <p>He listened carefully and vaguely heard a burst of laughter, like a group of cats screaming in the middle of the night.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the strange screams disappeared, and the seaweed creatures seemed to have lost their souls. They all fell into the sea, and the primitive land stopped attacking.</p>

  <p>"It appears that it will take some time for us to coexist with each other peacefully," Luo Zheng said in a solemn voice.</p>

  <p>It was true that he was still the master of this world, but his authority was only limited to these continents.</p>

  <p>"Your situation now is out of the ordinary. You can only explore slowly by yourself, but in the end, you should be able to find a way to coexist with the ancestry-level bloodline," the Primeval Lord of Heaven assured him.</p>

  <p>As for Dale, he glanced at the boundless ocean and thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"The primitive land has now expanded to this size. Luo Zheng, can you check the area outside the primitive land?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The area outside the primitive land..." Luo Zheng arched his eyebrows and said,</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please follow me!"</p>

  <p>He then created another avatar in his inner world to prevent the ancestry-level bloodline from attacking the continents again.</p>

  <p>There was an avatar that guarded the place, and another avatar followed the other three to the edge of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>There was a time when over a thousand Sanskrit words bounded his inner world, but those had disappeared and were replaced by "walls" woven from the meridians. If one looked closer, they would see the blood that rapidly flowed within the walls.</p>

  <p>"The chaos should be outside the wall," Dale confirmed.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a problem. How can we observe the outside world then?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, try to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline again and ask it to let us out..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested.</p>

  <p>Before he could finish speaking, Luo Zheng snorted coldly and placed his palms on the wall. He felt the wall's temperature.</p>

  <p>Then, without saying anything, he clawed at the wall and tore it down, which caused a huge crack!</p>

  <p>As a result, the chaotic energy surged and flowed straight into the crack.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing his reckless behavior, Dale, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess all smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>The primitive land and its master did not have a harmonious relationship.</p>

  <p>Most areas in the chaos were even empty and were devoid of life.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they went out through the crack and looked around.</p>

  <p>There was still nothing else in sight, except for the slowly drifting chaos clouds.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can you sense the location of the primitive land?" asked Dale.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head, and replied, "No."</p>

  <p>When his inner world had just been built, he could sense its location? but after that, he could not locate it anymore.</p>

  <p>"You have to find a way to locate it. The primitive land will be your only shelter," Dale said in a deathly serious tone.</p>
