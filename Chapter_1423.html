<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1423 Jevan Shen (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is the kid I was telling you about. He has a first-rank divine weapon and the Heavenly Phoenix Horse as his mount." Julian told Jevan in a low voice, "And the woman beside him is the woman I was going to send to you. She will be the best human cauldron ever for cultivation."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her uncle's words, Freya was both sad and angry. Her uncle wanted her to be the human cauldron for someone who had power over him! It seemed that the man that her uncle was talking about was this very person standing right in front of her. Suddenly, she felt awful about going to her uncle when she got into the Upper World. She never dreamed that her own uncle would be such a despicable person who even tried to get his hand on his own niece!</p>

  <p>Averting her gaze from her sinister uncle, Freya turned her eyes on the other man accompanying him. This person's cultivation base was much higher than her uncle's. She wondered if Luo Zheng was strong enough to deal with him. Although Zheng's performance was astounding in Freya's opinion, no matter how talented he was, there was still a limit of his capability. 'Defeating his uncle whose cultivation is a whole realm higher than his was already a miracle. How could he possibly defeat this person who might be two or more levels above him?' This thought instantly worried Freya.</p>

  <p>The stranger sized up Luo Zheng for a few times and a modest smile appeared on his face. He waved at Luo Zheng and spoke to him in a very friendly tone,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, it's good to see you again so soon."</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Jevan, Luo Zheng nodded slightly and replied, "Master Shen, good to see you, too."</p>

  <p>Both Freya and Julian were shocked at this friendly exchange. Both of them just stood there, dumbfounded as they had assumed that these two were enemies. However, shortly after, a smile eventually appeared on Freya's face. She assumed that this man was nothing like her own uncle.</p>

  <p>Even if Julian was in the form of blood mist, Luo Zheng could still see the unease on his face, quite contrary to his niece.</p>

  <p>'This can't be real! Master Shen is ranked so high that no one dares to greet him without bowing or saluting! I have never seen him talking so amicably to someone who messed up his men! At least, he has never spoken to me, or the other lords who are under his command, this way!'</p>

  <p>Julian's mind went wild. He couldn't process what was happening right in front of his 'bloody face' right then.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Julian concluded, if Master Shen was polite to this young man who just killed many of his own soldiers on his own land, then this meeting spelled bad news for him.</p>

  <p>While he had confirmed that the young man was indeed Luo Zheng, Jevan was still a little suspicious. He wasn't trying to hide it, so he asked Luo Zheng directly, "Hey, young hero. I heard from the Saint Lord earlier that you have been brought into the thirteenth palaces. May I ask why you returned to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place in such a short period of time?"</p>

  <p>Even the Saint Lord thought highly of Luo Zheng, so Jevan would surely treat him well for the potential greater good.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied with a smirk, "To be honest, Master Shen, I just happened to pass by this place. Surprisingly, I heard that a friend of mine, who ascended with me a year ago, was imprisoned by her own uncle. Do you know the worst part? Her uncle had threatened to make her a human cauldron for someone with power. Some authorities, I guess."</p>

  <p>'Friend? Uncle? Human cauldron? This is bad...'</p>

  <p>Jevan could feel the cold sweat trickle down his back!</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had no idea that Luo Zheng had joined the Gauze Pavilion already, nor did he know about what had happened to Luo Zheng back in the thirteen palaces. After all, with his status as a hall leader, he wasn't qualified to join the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>From this alone did Jevan deduce that Luo Zheng wasn't someone he could trifle with without worrying about the consequences. He just couldn't afford to risk his position, or his resources that had been accumulated over the years. Jevan clearly knew that, even if the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place were to meet the palace leader of the Mist Palace, the Saint Lord would offer her the highest courtesy. Even the world lord of the supreme world needed to show her respect!</p>

  <p>He was only one of the thirty-six hall masters in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. He was not such an important figure at all.</p>

  <p>A single word by the Saint Lord would silence him forever if Luo Zheng were to speak ill of him.</p>

  <p>Jevan also noticed that Luo Zheng and Freya were very close, although he wasn't quite clear whether they were just friends or there was something else brewing between them. Thinking of Julian's earlier proposal again nearly gave him a heart attack.</p>

  <p>'Offering your own niece to me as a human cauldron! What the hell was wrong with this Julian? It'll be better if you just kill me...' Jevan gave Julian a cold stare for his lack of consideration.</p>

  <p>Everyone had seen that Luo Zheng was taken by Yolande, which indicated that they might be friends. Jevan never had the chance to meet Yolande in person because he was not qualified to do so. If Luo Zheng were to tell Yolande all about today, he would be a dead man. More so, the leader of the Mist Palace was also the daughter of a Supreme Lord. A single glance from her could get him killed more than a thousand times!</p>

  <p>Jevan nodded at Luo Zheng with a sycophantic smile, "Young man, don't ever mention the human cauldron again. It's my improper management that caused my man to make such a big mistake. I sincerely apologize for that." After he finished groveling, he glanced at Julian who was standing beside him and continued deliberately, "I know now that this subordinate of mine is extremely vicious. If he was going to treat his own relative in such horrible way, then he has decided his own destiny, which is to be expelled from the position of city lord. I hope this decision will ease the tension of your beautiful female friend."</p>

  <p>Now, if Julian's face was in its true form, it must've turned pale like a blank piece of paper. He was deeply terrified that his horrible premonition had come true!</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Julian turned around all of a sudden and ran like he was being chased by the devil. As a human-shaped blood mist, he was able to run at a greater speed. In a split second, he had put fifty feet between them.</p>

  <p>Jevan sneered and pointed his finger at Julian, as though anticipating this outcome. Almost immediately, Julian let out a blood-curdling scream. At the same time, he collapsed and turned into several streams of blood froth. Then, the blood froth changed its shape repeatedly as if it was being compressed by an invisible hand. Gradually, Julian was kneaded by the compressing air, and shrank into a small piece of blood vigor, as light as a feather.</p>
