<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the furious onslaught of Layla's sword shadows, the warriors standing up against her had almost no room to fight back.</p>

  <p>They were quickly sliced into pieces and kicked out of the Illusion Space, never to be seen or heard from again.</p>

  <p>As her life vitality gently revolved, Layla's body began to emit a white mist, and the moisture from her wet clothes instantly disappeared, as if the mist was a warm and comfortable fire. She put both of her hands behind her head and gently stroked her astonishingly long hair. The white mist now surrounded her hair too and spread to the end of her long, lustrous locks.</p>

  <p>Even so, Layla's expressions weren't exactly happy. Though busy fighting, she still had been able to notice Luo Luo Zheng, who had passed the twelfth round of the test long before her. He was standing in front of her with a long sword in his arms, looking at her with a meaningful gaze!</p>

  <p>She looked towards him and gave him a fierce glare, "Don't be cheeky!</p>

  <p>I'll be faster than you in the next round!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and a noncommittal expression appeared on his face in response. He then silently started the thirteenth round...</p>

  <p>Adrian had already arranged three groups of candidates to deal with them in the thirteenth round. Right now, he was going to take care of a more serious matter.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were fighting, he passed through a crowd of people in the enormous square and headed towards the large cages...</p>

  <p>These cages were seven in number and placed on a high platform. If a warrior was able to hold on to himself through the final challenge, these cages would be opened and the condemned prisoners within them would be released. This was the ultimate trial of the Passing the Torch event.</p>

  <p>The cages were enormous, but the warriors inside had been standing ever since they had been locked in. One among them was a burly and sturdily built man, who looked like the most powerful of them all.</p>

  <p>From beginning to end, the burly man had never opened his eyes...</p>

  <p>All of these prisoners were extremely strong and even from a distance, emitted an extremely ruthless Mu Ning. Almost all of the warriors who participated in the training were unwilling to approach this platform.</p>

  <p>Adrian flew towards the platform and headed straight for the large cage in the middle.</p>

  <p>Inside it, the burly man was sitting still with his eyes closed. "Who are you?" he asked when he sensed someone approach him.</p>

  <p>"My name is Adrian Rao," Adrian replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Came a gruff and succinct response.</p>

  <p>Adrian placed his head next to the pillar of the cage and softly uttered, "I want something; it's about the secret treasure of the Dark World..."</p>

  <p>Before Adrian could even finish his words, the burly man's eyes popped open and he stood up.</p>

  <p>The instant he opened his eyes, an extremely sharp soul suppression force was abruptly shot out, making Adrian's body tremble in fear and crumble down. Immediately after that, his face turned extremely pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>"You are just a nobody! How and what do you know about the secret treasure of the Dark World?" The tall man uttered furiously.</p>

  <p>Although Adrian had just spat out a mouthful of blood, a faint smile still appeared on his pale face. After wiping the traces of blood from the corner of his mouth, he replied, "You are right. I am indeed not a big shot. However, you don't seem to be that important either..."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the burly man snorted and said, "You are right. I am only a Soul Sea Realm warrior who can easily be called a nobody in this big universe. But you are not qualified to judge me."</p>

  <p>Adrian smiled faintly. "You were the most outstanding talent of the Star World in the past. I also know you were qualified to enter the Gauze Pavilion. I am obviously not a patch on you... However, in the end, you managed to end up being caught. Now you are just a prisoner who is going to live only for eight hundred years..."</p>

  <p>This condemned prisoner was going to be executed eight hundred years later. For mortals, a time span of eight hundred years was equivalent to a dozen or so lifetimes, but for a Soul Sea Realm warrior, eight hundred years were nothing. For these prisoners, they were going to be executed real soon.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you trying to do?" the burly man asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Adrian still did not directly answer the burly man's question. Instead, he continued, "You are all condemned prisoners selected from the Villain World. However, If you succeed in assassinating the talents of thirteen palaces, you can be pardoned and released."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," the burly man snorted in a cold voice. He could not believe this man.</p>

  <p>Warriors who took part in the competition were rewarded with various kinds of objects if they got good results during the event. And these condemned prisoners were supposed to be rewarded if they successfully attacked and killed the talents of thirteen palaces. This time, the reward was their freedom.</p>

  <p>This arrangement was made because the idea of being free and fleeing death would make these prisoners go all out on their opponents.</p>

  <p>However, these condemned prisoners rarely had the chance to go to battle. Furthermore, once they did get a chance to fight, their opponents were often extremely strong and talented. Thus, they didn't have many chances to obtain freedom.</p>

  <p>"I can help you get a chance to fight," Adrian spoke.</p>

  <p>"And then?" The burly man coldly asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you how to defeat your opponent and gain your freedom,"</p>

  <p>Adrian responded.</p>

  <p>On hearing such a notion, the burly man immediately smiled. His smile was filled with contempt for Adrian. "Who are you? A nobody! I don't need you to teach me..."</p>

  <p>The burly man was far stronger than Adrian in terms of cultivation base, strength, and talent. Even if he were to fight with a hundred warriors who were as powerful as Adrian, he could have annihilated them himself in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, Adrian didn't get angry even though he had just been scorned by the burly man. He calmly smiled and replied, "You might not know this, but there are only two warriors left in the Passing the Torch. They are the most powerful warriors who have ever taken part in the event.</p>

  <p>My advantage is that I have the right to decide which one of you will fight them."</p>

  <p>Adrian was speaking to the burly man through his life vitality, and the other prisoners nearby couldn't hear his words.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the burly man finally frowned. "So, that is the reason you are so confident of yourself and dare to invite me."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Adrian had broad smile on his face. He also took out a pill and put it into his mouth. Just now, the soul suppression force from the burly man had caused some damage to his soul. He had to take care of it.</p>

  <p>"What do you want? Why would you do this?" the burly man asked again.</p>

  <p>Adrian then stretched out three fingers. "Thirty percent. When you find the secret treasures of the Dark World, I want thirty percent!"</p>

  <p>"Thirty percent? Do you even know what the secret treasures of the Dark World mean?" The burly man's face revealed an evil grin.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I know and that is why I only want thirty percent," Adrian replied.</p>

  <p>Adrian was good at observing others and figuring out their thoughts, and he also behaved with a sense of propriety. Thus, by his own rules, he only wanted to take thirty percent of the treasures, instead of asking for more.</p>

  <p>The burly man closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh. He had been very famous and respected in the past, but now, he was exiled to the Villain World and his fate was being controlled by a nobody like Adrian.</p>

  <p>Adrian guessed what the burly man was thinking, and indifferently told him, "Look. Everyone has his own uses. It is true that the warriors of this universe respect only those who are the most powerful among them all, but this matter is also very important. Don't look down on me. If you cooperate with me, it would be even easier for you to get the secret treasures of the Dark World."</p>

  <p>When he was uttering these words, he looked very confident. Perhaps many warriors thought that Adrian was just good at playing petty tricks, but he wanted to show them that these so called petty tricks could bring about fatal threats, and could even reverse situations.</p>

  <p>The burly man opened his eyes once again and looked at Adrian with a complicated expression. He then stood up and said indifferently,</p>

  <p>"Alright, I agree..."</p>

  <p>Only then did Adrian return to the massive square with a satisfied expression on his face. There were numerous warriors in the square who were looking at the scenes occurring in the Illusion Space. They were all discussing about the fight with excitement. Suddenly, someone greeted Adrian, "Adrian, we failed to deal with that woman. How can we break her move and win against her?"</p>

  <p>"The warriors in the third group also can't hold on for much longer against her. She is too powerful! Adrian, think of a way!"</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Adrian's face. He replied with a serious tone,</p>

  <p>"It's fine. The next group should be..."</p>

  <p>In fact, he had no interest in attacking Layla and Luo Luo Zheng right now.</p>

  <p>However, in order to deal with this group of hot-blooded fellows, he naturally had to pay a price. After a series of detailed analysis, he was rewarded with a resounding cheer from the warriors present there. After that, he selected some of the warriors to form the fourth group and sent them into the Illusion Space for the next round.</p>

  <p>The fourteenth round...</p>

  <p>The fifteenth round...</p>

  <p>The sixteenth round...</p>

  <p>Inside the ancient palace, the warriors from the thirteen palaces could clearly see that the strength that the two contestants were displaying inside the Illusion Space was far beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>If the warriors who had passed nineteen rounds before them took part in the fights that were going on right now, they probably wouldn't have lasted even for the first sixteen rounds.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were not ordinary warriors after all. Although they felt that it was getting increasingly difficult to win by the moment, they were still able to suppress their opponents and had passed every round of test till now with their own strength.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a slight difference between the two of them...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still only relying on his Thunder Wind Divine Sword and had not yet showed signs of using any other weapon.</p>

  <p>However, Layla had already used a number of her trump cards. Each time she made use of a new supernormal skill, her opponents would be able to come up with a method to restrain it, making that skill useless in the next round. This was going to reduce her number of moves with every round.</p>

  <p>But an advantage she still had was that the number and quality of martial arts she was proficient in were unimaginable.</p>
