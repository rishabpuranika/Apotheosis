  <p>
</p>

  <p>After he had killed the three warriors, Luo Luo Zheng got lost in some deep thought.</p>

  <p>Something was itching in the back of his mind.</p>

  <p>Even Freya, who was standing beside him, could feel that something was wrong with him. It seemed that Luo Luo Zheng was not in a good mood and after Freya continued to try talking to him for a while, Luo Luo Zheng began to ignore her.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the problem that Luo Luo Zheng was thinking about wasn't really a problem in the eyes of other warriors.</p>

  <p>That was because even though they could work hard to achieve numerous kinds of things, they often lacked an ultimate and definite goal.</p>

  <p>In the early days, Luo Luo Zheng had indeed been guided by Yan. Perhaps this was a kind of arrangement by his fate. And even now, Yan was still the main impetus to make him move forward!</p>

  <p>However, searching for Yan was something that Luo Luo Zheng only had to accomplish, and not his ultimate goal. No. His ultimate and definite goal was something that came from the most resolute determination in his mind.</p>

  <p>His obsession was indeed to pursue mastery in the martial arts. He wanted to see what level of strength he could achieve as he continued his cultivation. Would he be able to control this world, or would he be able to go on and create his own world?</p>

  <p>After he had flown into the Upper World, it had come to his discovery that the rules here were similar to those in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>A feeling of disgust arose in his heart as he thought about that, and this sort of disgust would accumulate into confusion soon. If he still had to see the same scenery and go through the same experiences even after he reached higher cultivation levels and ascended to the Upper world, then he simply could not be interested in anything!</p>

  <p>What even Luo Luo Zheng himself didn't know was that he had fallen into a mental predicament now. He was at a loss for what to do.</p>

  <p>This so-called mental predicament was a shackle of the warrior spirit!</p>

  <p>When Eddie had taken Yan away, Luo Luo Zheng had gotten trapped into a similar type of mental predicament too, but one that was caused by his opponent.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to break out of such a dilemma, all he had to do was to defeat Eddie and get Yan back. After that, his warrior spirit would recover and be unimpeded!</p>

  <p>But this time, the problem had originated from within Luo Luo Zheng himself. The man, for the first time in his life, had doubts about the goal that he had been pursuing this whole time. In fact, he was even feeling tired about something.</p>

  <p>Such a kind of dilemma and confusion was far more serious and troublesome than the one caused by Eddie's actions. It could even break Luo Luo Zheng if he let it. The way out last time was to set his mind towards his opponent and win over the latter. This time, what could he do?</p>

  <p>This time, his opponent was himself.</p>

  <p>And as was often said, the most powerful opponent of a man was his own self. It wouldn't be easy for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat himself and escape this time. He had to have a plan.</p>

  <p>While he was searching for life vitality crystals in the mines, he hadn't chosen to enter the bottom layer, since he didn't have much of an interest in that.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had hastily finished mining, only finding a few supreme life vitality crystals in the process and then getting out.</p>

  <p>After seeing Luo Zheng's indifferent and morose expressions, Freya didn't ask him anything. He wasn't replying anyway. However, after witnessing Luo Zheng's strength, she knew that it was fortunate for her to be able to obtain Luo Zheng's protection before she could find her uncle. If it wasn't for him, she might have had to rely on some other powerful warrior like other women who had ascended to the Upper World. And she wasn't sure she could have found a decent one in time.</p>

  <p>After returning to the gathering place, Luo Luo Zheng casually found a place and sat down with his legs crossed. However, he did not cultivate.</p>

  <p>He was still racking his brains, trying to come up with an answer to the big question.</p>

  <p>Many warriors would encounter this kind of problem. A warrior, who worked hard in his cultivation would, one day, suddenly lose the motivation to move on, and ask what the meaning of life was. What was the point?</p>

  <p>If the warrior couldn't find an answer to that, it was very likely that he would be utterly defeated by his own self, and his temperament would undergone a huge change. His strength could come crumbling down like paper castle. However, once he found the answer, his mind would undergo a transformation and he would be elevated to a higher level!</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng was trapped in that limbo between the two possibilities.</p>

  <p>While he was sitting, lost in thought, Riyad, wearing a black cape, strutted through the gathering place and headed straight towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Some of the newcomers didn't know about Riyad's power, but most of the warriors there knew clearly that even though he was also from the Lower World, it was better for them to not provoke him. This guy was known to be even harder to deal with than the armored warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. And that was saying something.</p>

  <p>The reason behind that was that those armored warriors were bound by the rules of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. But there was nothing restraining Riyad's behavior and he could do whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>Although he was just a warrior who ascended from the Lower World, he had the power to decide the life and death of everyone else in this mine!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still sitting quietly on the spot with his eyes tightly shut. He kept on pondering over the question which was puzzling him.</p>

  <p>Even the cyan dragon noticed the change in Luo Zheng's mental state.</p>

  <p>However, he did not say anything and only carefully watched Luo Zheng's every move. He had already guessed that Luo Luo Zheng was in a mental predicament, and this was a very troublesome state to be in. What was worse, the more confidence and persistence Luo Luo Zheng had before, the more difficult this predicament would be!</p>
