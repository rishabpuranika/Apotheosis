  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's goal now was to pass the third section of the True Path.</p>

  <p>Gus had ambushed him in the third section.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng believed that Gus was his master's second disciple, he did not hold back at all.</p>

  <p>Gus was too strong. If Zheng gave him a chance, Zheng might lose to him.</p>

  <p>Right now, Gus could no longer fight back, so it was a good time to have a talk, like he had suggested earlier.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's cunning smile, Gus rolled his eyes. "How could you treat me like this?" he asked in anger.</p>

  <p>He had been bullied by his master's first apprentice for a number of years. Now that he had met the third apprentice, he thought he would turn the situation around in his favor. To his chagrin, however, Zheng fought him fiercely at their very first meeting. It disgusted Gus to no end.</p>

  <p>Zheng's smile grew an inch wider. "Is this what you want to talk about?"</p>

  <p>He held the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand as he spoke, as if ready to cut Gus' head off at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Gus was unhappy to a great extent.</p>

  <p>Zheng paused for some time and asked, "What exactly do you want to say?"</p>

  <p>"You know what, I did this for your own good. In any case, we have the same master," Gus said in despair. "If our senior fellow disciple comes to know about this, he may decide to punish me again."</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to look indifferently at Gus, not saying a word.</p>

  <p>"You're a member of the fairy palace, but you've only cultivated the Primal Chaos Technique. Your other cultivation methods don't originate from the library, correct?" Gus asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slowly. He was not sure how Gus knew of it, but he had indeed not chosen to cultivate the other cultivation methods in the library.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of martial arts in the library; even the Transcendent Divine Might was commonly seen, but Zheng believed that he was suited the best only to certain cultivation methods. In addition to the Primal Chaos Technique, he had only read books on the Original Laws in the library.</p>

  <p>"Ah, what a waste! You have many treasures, but you don't make good use of them." Gus heaved a sigh, curling his lips in distaste.</p>

  <p>"Hey, your body is fast disappearing. Could you just get to the point?"</p>

  <p>Zheng reminded him.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies had transformed into Gus' body. Now that he was severely injured, the part of the body above his chest was slowly dissipating back into Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>However, Gus himself did not care a bit. He continued, "This wisp of my soul isn't able to tell your fortune. But as my master's disciple, if you can't even cross the heavens, it's a joke. To be honest, if you merely rely on the Emotion Closing Godly Way, you will find it unimaginably hard to cross the heavens. Since our master is not here, I will guide you on his behalf."</p>

  <p>"Your neck is about to disappear too," Zheng reminded him expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>Most of Gus' body had disappeared. Even his neck was slowly diffusing away, turning into Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>"I know!" Gus screamed with contempt. "I don't need you to remind me!"</p>

  <p>"Then don't talk such a load of garbage!" Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"..." Gus stared at Zheng, clenching his teeth in bitter hatred. "A long time ago," he said, "I heard our master mention that if the Primal Chaos Technique was combined with other cultivation methods, it would have fundamental changes. Now that our master is not here, I can recommend you a few cultivation methods on his behalf, and you can cultivate them in the fairy palace. They are the Enemy Repelling Arts, the Thunderbolt Annihilation, and the Eight Smoky Melodies."</p>

  <p>"Do they belong to the Transcendent Divine Might?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Gus' face revealed a hint of disdain. "Transcendent Divine Might? Come on! Only those in the universe dare to claim their martial arts to be transcendent! Hah! I don't know whether or not they belong to Transcendent Divine Might, but I should tell you that I was able to dominate the universe and cross the heavens once I mastered them years ago. And although you're not as strong as me, you're not weak either."</p>

  <p>As he finished, his entire head began to disappear, turning into energies.</p>

  <p>However, just as he dissipated, a speck of light appeared from the Dark and Light energies and circled Zheng once before a ray of consciousness penetrated into his mind. "Work hard. I'll wait for you. When you meet me, I'll tell you more. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Following this, the speck of light began to rapidly rise higher and higher until it reached the pink enchanted barrier at the top of the fairy palace. It crept outside and completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>In the Endless Divine Land above the heavens.</p>

  <p>Within the dense fog were many glittering, richly ornamented buildings.</p>

  <p>A cyan ox knelt on the top of one of the buildings. On the back of the ox sat a boy, holding a flute to his mouth as he played it softly.</p>

  <p>Not long after, someone jumped toward the building, waving at the boy.</p>

  <p>"Brother! Brother!"</p>

  <p>The figure leaped and landed on the top of the building, where the boy was.</p>

  <p>Boom! A loud sound rang out and some tiles on the roof were shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Moo..."</p>

  <p>The cyan ox, frightened by the sound, protested in dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>The boy put down the flute in his hand and stared at the intruder unkindly. "What is it that makes you so flustered?" he asked in a chilly tone.</p>

  <p>"Brother, did you know that our master has accepted a third disciple?"</p>

  <p>The man smiled as he asked the question.</p>

  <p>The boy was surprised at his words. "A third disciple? You mean, our master found a suitable person to cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the boy is only at the Soul Sea Realm. He's still struggling under the heavens."</p>

  <p>The person speaking was Gus.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Gus was only his nickname. His full name was Augustus Yu. In the Endless Divine Land, he was a well-known figure.</p>

  <p>"A Soul Sea Realm boy?" The boy looked to be deep in contemplation.</p>

  <p>He put the flute to his waist, stretched out his fingers, and gently pinched them together. A mysterious halo of light spread out on his palm.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord could not arbitrarily tell the fortune of someone in the universe. The only way to tell it was if the person whose fortune was to be told stood in front of the fortune teller. Back then, the specific location of the Crown of Destiny had been estimated accurately because it was scarce and there were few variables.</p>

  <p>Yet, the boy was trying to see Zheng's fortune.</p>

  <p>After the faint halo of light came to being, it slowly rose up. The boy constantly moved his fingers. After a while, his face betrayed his confusion. He could not see anything.</p>

  <p>As the halo completely disappeared, the boy waved his hand again and another halo of light spread out. He continued to try to tell Zheng's fortune.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The boy was taken aback. "The martial artist seems to be a man without destiny! I can't tell his fortune!"</p>

  <p>"A man without destiny?" Gus was surprised as well.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing under the heavens that I cannot know, except those without destiny. That is the only explanation to this." The boy frowned as he stared at his fingers. He glared at Gus and continued," You have cultivated the special vision technique and a wisp of your soul fragment alone can tell the fortunes of others. Since you met him in the fairy palace, why didn't you tell his fortune?"</p>

  <p>"Well..." An innocent expression appeared on Gus' face. "Brother, I have recommended three cultivation methods to him."</p>

  <p>"That's not enough! What a good-for-nothing!" The boy gently patted the cyan ox and it struggled a few times before standing on its feet. "I am leaving."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the cyan ox lifted its four hooves and soared into the sky.</p>

  <p>Just then, Gus remembered something. He smacked his head. "Brother, there's one more thing! As far as I know, our little brother cultivates the Emotion Closing Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way?" The boy turned around with a thoughtful expression on his face. "Isn't he only at the Soul Sea Realm?"</p>

  <p>Gus shrugged. "I too find it strange. He has mastered much of the Emotion Closing Godly Way. When my soul fragment transformed into a Soul Sea Realm warrior, it was killed by his sword intent!"</p>

  <p>"You are truly useless." Saying this dismissive statement, the boy swiftly left with his ox.</p>

  <p>Gus was visibly upset as he watched his brother leave. He sat down on the top of the building, looking sulky.</p>

  <p>Over the years, he had always been looked down upon by his senior fellow disciple. By now he was accustomed to it.</p>

  <p>However, a faint smile soon emerged on his face. If Zheng could cross the heavens in the future, he would have a little brother to bully too!</p>
