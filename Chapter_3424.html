  <p>
</p>

  <p>The curly strands of hair were like steel needles wrapping instantaneously around the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Previously, Mya had used such a method to entangle her.</p>

  <p>The hair was extremely tough and unbreakable by force.</p>

  <p>The mother didn't pay any bit of attention to Mya or Mount? her sole desire was to crush Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm done!"</p>

  <p>As Mya's hair tied up the mother's body, some hair also wrapped around Mount's figure.</p>

  <p>"Let's head out."</p>

  <p>Carrying Mya on his shoulder, Mount then walked out of the light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the hurricane blew the two into the air.</p>

  <p>Her hair straightened up under the force of the wind.</p>

  <p>Strong inertia pushed them to circle the mother once before rushing directly to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As they approached him, a golden light flashed in Mount's eyes as a strong aura burst from his figure.</p>

  <p>"Uha!"</p>

  <p>A black spiral emerged above his head as he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Dark Space World!"</p>

  <p>As it spun, a strange gravitational force was formed from the motion.</p>

  <p>While it wasn't a particularly powerful force, the rules within it began folding the surrounding space.</p>

  <p>Any means related to space was prohibited within the Chaotic Source World. No one could make use of Grand Teleportation or any other space-related methods.</p>

  <p>But Mount had violated this very rule.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>All the space within a ten-foot radius of the black spiral collapsed into it.</p>

  <p>The surrounding space was also quickly influenced as it got sucked in.</p>

  <p>About a hundred feet away from the spiral, the space squeezed inward for ten feet, along with the entire core area. The whole Chaotic Source World seemed to shift ten feet with the black spiral in its center.</p>

  <p>The entire Source World and chaos shifted along with it.</p>

  <p>But ten feet was such a short distance that it could easily go unnoticed by both the Chaotic Source World and the Source World.</p>

  <p>Within the entire Icy Snow Province, only Fuxi, sitting atop the snow mountain, noticed the newly folded space.</p>

  <p>He stared at Mount with great contempt.</p>

  <p>"He got serious too soon, didn't he? To use a truth-level trick to deal with a young warrior who hasn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm? how shameful?" Fuxi muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Still, he had no intention of lending a hand.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, it was fate.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng died in the hands of Mount or the Evil God, that only proved how blind Gerald was.</p>

  <p>He was unwilling to accept the fact that the mission he had begged for all his life fell upon such a man.</p>

  <p>The sight of the black spiral put a dark cloud over the atmosphere at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World where the many leaders of different forces gathered.</p>

  <p>"What is that trick?!" Phoenix exclaimed, bewildered.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu's talent lay in their divine flames, while the demon women of the Divine Lair were especially good at any trick that had to do with space. Phoenix, for instance, had cultivated the Truth of Void Destruction to reach the Other Shore? something common among the demon women. It was why the Jin Wu's strength had nearly no advantage in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Phoenix could cast the Illusory Projection in far-away spaces to kill her enemies. She had an understanding and attainment in space that no ordinary warrior could dream of matching.</p>

  <p>But upon seeing the black spiral, her heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Uncharacteristically, she couldn't understand the space mystery in the trick at all.</p>

  <p>When the leader of the Divine Farmer race saw Mount's trick, his expression remained steady.</p>

  <p>Mount was well known as a unique existence in the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>While he was a member of the younger generation, he held a special high status. Even the Divine Farmer was polite when facing him? it wasn't hard to guess just how powerful he was.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, watch out!"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe, Winchell, and the other leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had their eyes wide in shock.</p>

  <p>Whenever they caught Luo Zheng in a tough situation, he had always been able to deal with all sorts of tricks easily.</p>

  <p>But even Qiu Yinhe couldn't comprehend Mount's move? the power hidden within it was difficult to gauge.</p>

  <p>He couldn't wrap his head around how such a young man had mastered such a trick.</p>

  <p>And so there Luo Zheng was, trapped within a ten-foot radius of the black spiral.</p>

  <p>The mother's hand entered the folded space along with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Once the space folded, the part of the hand was torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and the members of the various races all exclaimed upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! How can this be?"</p>

  <p>"The crystals inside the mother's body haven't been exhausted. How did her hand get torn apart like that? It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"This isn't natural?"</p>

  <p>The crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits were supposed to be indestructible materials.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to destroy a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, they'd have to completely exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the warrior's body.</p>

  <p>Before that, no attack would be the least bit effective on the warrior.</p>

  <p>But the mother still seemed energetic? not tired in the least.</p>

  <p>Before the crystals were used up, the mother's body should have been indestructible. Not even a drop of blood could be drawn.</p>

  <p>But when the black spiral pulled in slightly, half of her hand was broken off? it was an intimidating sight to every being present.</p>

  <p>In one of the arrays, a dark shadow stood behind a nonhuman creature.</p>

  <p>Because the shadow was so close to the creature, it went unnoticed by anyone else in the array.</p>

  <p>It was none other than the Evil God.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed as he examined the black spiral.</p>

  <p>Before that very moment, apart from Luo Zheng, no one in the Chaotic Source World was worth a second of his attention? not even Yan, Luo Zheng's sister.</p>

  <p>Now, his expression hardened at the sight of Mount's move.</p>

  <p>But that lasted only a moment before his serious eyes were replaced by a look of interest like he had just locked onto his next prey.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>It took a mere moment for the black spiral to fold the space.</p>

  <p>It only spun for a few seconds until it disappeared. The black spiral, half of the mother's hand, and Luo Zheng had all disappeared without a trace, as though they had never existed.</p>

  <p>"Aoo... Woo!"</p>

  <p>The mother of Chaotic Source Spirits roared, covering the half of her hand that remained on her body. Never did she think anyone could ever hurt her.</p>

  <p>In her pain, she shifted her anger toward Mount and Mya.</p>

  <p>"Retreat,"</p>

  <p>Mount spat out harshly.</p>

  <p>The hair on Mya's head faintly glowed. Still tied to the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, it began extending rapidly.</p>

  <p>From afar, it looked as though the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was flying a kite, with Mya's hair serving as the kite's thread. The two people on the other end of it flew higher and higher in the wind.</p>
