<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2835 Falling Star Palm </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sword Chen didn't stop and continued to exert his strength. He wasn't alone as the others also struggled to give their all.</p>

  <p>Samuel spared no effort but was also caught in a pickle at the moment.</p>

  <p>He kept on activating the Spear of Supreme Harmony to create a new space channel. This weapon had helped decrease the damage he had taken by using the new space channels for him to hide.</p>

  <p>As a result of creating multiple space channels, he disappeared and appeared from time to time like a shining star from the heavens.</p>

  <p>Just like a drowning man struggling to keep himself afloat in the water as he gasped for air, he used his remaining strength to struggle on the edge of the vortex.</p>

  <p>The woman had noticed the strategy Samuel tried to keep himself away from danger. She instantly gave an order to Samuel's clone and imitated what Samuel had done, following his actions to create space channels. She moved in a swift manner and then instantly concealed herself before grabbing Sword Chen inside for a chance to survive.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! No more struggles! Both of you, come to me!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas fiercely bellowed. He only had one head left and the flesh below his neck had already been refined into red crystals.</p>

  <p>Exerting every bit of his remaining strength, he had managed to pull the eight-diagram disc.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be long before the Furnace of Dark and Light was completely absorbed into his body. Everything inside space which included the eight-diagram disc made from the Dark and Light energies, Luo Zheng, Tianming and even himself, would be refined!</p>

  <p>"It didn't work," Tianming said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he looked at the situation and responded, "No, it worked.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas managed to maintain the balance of the eight-diagram disc again. Our attacks were not strong enough. We must do better than this."</p>

  <p>He believed that once their attacks had exceeded the range Nicholas could control, the furnace would break apart!</p>

  <p>Tianming thought about the plan and agreed. A trace of determination appeared on his vigorous face, but he was still feeling a bit hesitant deep inside.</p>

  <p>He was created for these moments.</p>

  <p>He had evaluated carefully about their situation and hoped that someone else would save the day.</p>

  <p>Maybe he didn't have to use that power?</p>

  <p>This thought kept haunting him, preventing him from using his trump card.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Iris's face kept flashing in his mind.</p>

  <p>Iris, his wife, was still on the Floating Island waiting for him to go back to her.</p>

  <p>This thought finally helped him make up his mind.</p>

  <p>He immediately composed himself as the hesitation in his mind gradually faded away.</p>

  <p>A golden light then appeared on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>An imposing aura started to emit from him.</p>

  <p>"Tianming? What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, his face full of confusion.</p>

  <p>Nicholas suddenly felt the change and was also stunned. He sensed that the special aura was coming out of Tianming.</p>

  <p>He felt it was familiar and realized that Tianming had once used the skill in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>When he activated it earlier, even the little fiends couldn't lay a finger on him.</p>

  <p>Nicholas felt strange about this before but he just shrugged it off. He didn't think too much about it and just thought of it as a special soul attack.</p>

  <p>But as Tianming's aura became increasingly strong, he was proven wrong with his assumptions. He now felt threatened. He had indeed underestimated it.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Nicholas asked, showing a shocked expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was worried.</p>

  <p>Nicholas throughout had been trying his best to maintain the balance under Luo Zheng's and Tianming's attacks.</p>

  <p>However, if one of them used a more powerful skill as Tianming just did, it was unlikely that Nicholas would stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"Feel my power Nicholas! This will be your end!"</p>

  <p>Tianming's face appeared calm and solemn as the golden light on his body shone brighter.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The golden light suddenly moved and started to gather towards the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng observed what happened and couldn't help but stare at Tianming with a trace of suspicion in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The golden light on Tianming's body started to fade away. It started to fade on his feet, and right after the golden light disappeared, his feet turned into stones!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>There was a ripple of energy as it didn't stop there. His legs, knees and all the lower parts of his body turned to grayish stones. On the other hand, the golden light on his sword continued to shine brighter! The power within was terrifying!</p>

  <p>"Damn it!</p>

  <p>Stop now, Lowell!</p>

  <p>I treated you nicely. How dare you intend to kill me?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas shouted in despair.</p>

  <p>He used the Dark energy to rush towards Tianming but, Tianming was now as solid as a massive rock, and he didn't even move an inch!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>On Tianming's body, the golden light had almost faded away and bits of it slightly reflected. Two-thirds of his body had already turned into stones.</p>

  <p>"It's about time..." Tianming spoke in a solemn voice and turned to face Luo Zheng, giving hint of a gentle smile. It was a bright one, but it contained a hint of regret that his fate had come to this.</p>

  <p>'In fact, I don't want to die right now. Why should it be me instead of you?' he secretly thought to himself full of regret.</p>

  <p>His fate was decided the very moment he was born into the universe, and he had no right to choose his destiny.</p>

  <p>Both minds of Luo Zheng and Tianming were connected through the two girls, so Luo Zheng naturally felt the other's distress. His eyebrows instantly twitched as he realized what Tianming was trying to do!</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what kind of method Tianming was going to use, he sensed that it would be deadly once a strike from the sword was made.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Tianming had lifted the Soaring Snake Sword, Luo Zheng acted quickly.</p>

  <p>He suddenly reached out and pressed his arm down.</p>

  <p>"There's no time left. Why are you stopping me?" Tianming asked fretfully as he was stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng had stopped Tianming, Nicholas's eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope. "Well done! Stop him. Don't let him strike me! His sword attack will cost his own life. He will definitely die if he unleashes this strike!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Luo Zheng looked down at Nicholas. He sneered, "There's no need to kill you at the expense of his life!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made a quick movement which gave a trace of astonishment on Tianming's face. He didn't know why Luo Zheng had such confidence.</p>

  <p>Not missing any second, Luo Zheng extended his arm. An incredibly strong power flowed in his hand and it quickly turned into a green light. As the light coagulated, it quickly formed into a square crystal!</p>

  <p>"W-what's this?! How's it possible that there's such magnificent power in the world?"</p>

  <p>As Nicholas observed the crystal, he was visibly surprised.</p>

  <p>He had perfected the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos and even believed that he was the strongest throughout the entire divine land. He was the kind of person who never took anyone seriously other than the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Samuel was not even qualified to be regarded as a rival. Samuel was nothing without the Spear of Supreme Harmony!</p>

  <p>But the two young warriors fighting him right now had shown great power beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>The golden light that Tianming summoned was incredibly surprising enough.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the square crystal that Luo Zheng materialized emitted an indescribable aura of mystery!</p>

  <p>"This is the power that you can never understand!</p>

  <p>It represents...</p>

  <p>The truth of the entire chaos!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng explained in a cold voice as the square crystal in his hand began to spin.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a green vortex appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>A special star could be seen in the center of the vortex. The star seemed irrelevant in size, but it couldn't be taken lightly by its appearance. In truth, nothing in the entire divine land could battle its great power!</p>

  <p>It turned out that the power of the Furnace of Dark and Light fainted in comparison with the tiny star.</p>

  <p>The three people struggling at the edge of the huge vortex? the woman, Sword Chen and Samuel were not subjected to its influence. They certainly felt its power as they showed different unbelievable expressions upon seeing the star.</p>

  <p>Samuel revealed his astonishment and fear at the same time. The woman showed curiosity and Sword Chen beamed with pleasure and relief.</p>

  <p>Everyone were all taken aback by the surprising turn of events. It was beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>Nobody would have expected that Luo Zheng still hid such a powerful skill up his sleeve!</p>
