<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was true that not all of the strong races established their strongholds in either the Myriad Spirits City or the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>In fact, many of them chose to open up a gathering place in the wilderness of the Other Shore, and founded their strongholds there. It was dangerous, but it gave them more freedom.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Li Shan mountain's stronghold in Stage Fourteen was in the wilderness not far from the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Since the Li Shan mountain had settled there, some relatively weak races and even some creatures from the Other Shore had also moved to the same place.</p>

  <p>After half a chaotic era had passed, their stronghold had grown to a certain size and formed a small town.</p>

  <p>The six Star Falcons soared up above the town, their huge bodies covered in the darkness. Only the starry gems shone brightly on their chests.</p>

  <p>If one didn't look carefully, the bright dots in the sky looked just like equally-distanced stars, instead of the actual Star Falcons that were flying up above.</p>

  <p>In the town below, a white-haired ape was observing the six stars.</p>

  <p>The ape came from the White Ape race in Stage Fourteen. The White Ape race used to live in the Sky Water City, but later on they became an enemy of the Star Falcon race due to some conflicts. At last, they were even driven out from the city.</p>

  <p>In these years, the White Ape race had been working hard to return to the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>The ape, however, didn't exactly know about the chaos that had been happening in the Sky Water City over the past few days. He only knew that someone from the Star Falcon race had contacted him and asked for help. If he succeeded, then the whole White Ape race could return to the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>It was truly a great opportunity for the White Ape race!</p>

  <p>This ape had been staying in the small town for a long time, so he had a good relationship with the Li Shan mountain. Moreover, he had helped some of the Souls of Light from the Li Shan mountain when they had been in trouble.</p>

  <p>When he was done gazing at the six stars in the sky, he looked at the stronghold of the Li Shan mountain and said, "The White Ape race has helped the Li Shan mountain a lot. Now, it's time for you to repay us..."</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he walked straight into the Li Shan mountain's stronghold.</p>

  <p>As the Li Shan mountain members were familiar with the White Ape race, none of them stopped the ape when they saw him.</p>

  <p>The ape entered the inner area, where he found a member of the Snake Goddess race from the Li Shan mountain. Her name was Naomi, and she was the leader of the Snake Spirit Sect. She had been at the Chaotic Source Realm for over a hundred years.</p>

  <p>Recently, she had returned to Stage Fourteen to guide the members of the Li Shan mountain who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"Whitehead, what brings you here?" Naomi asked. The ape, which they called Whitehead, sported a mysterious look.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Key to the Sun Crown Temple in the north has emerged.</p>

  <p>As far as I know, that temple hasn't been explored for two chaotic eras. It's a huge chance!" he announced.</p>

  <p>Naomi was touched upon hearing the ape's words, and she became a little excited.</p>

  <p>Ever since her members who had recently reached the Chaotic Source Realm got to Stage Fourteen, the Li Shan mountain also had been short of resources.</p>

  <p>If she could lead her members to explore this temple in secret, then they would surely be able to resolve their burning needs. "But who has the key?"</p>

  <p>Naomi asked.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Key to a temple that had been sealed off for countless years would surely be expensive if it had appeared.</p>

  <p>Just then, Whitehead reached out his fluffy hand and thin lines appeared on his palm. "The Other Shore Key is here, but this time the White Ape race needs to earn some. Whoever from the Li Shan mountain wants to get to the temple has to pay one hundred thousand soul pills," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Naomi answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand soul pills were absolutely a good deal. She waved her tail to summon a woman, who left the Other Shore and informed the members of the Li Shan mountain to return to the Other Shore as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Whitehead secretly cackled in his mind when Naomi agreed so frankly.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about those soul pills, and the Other Shore Key he spoke of was absolutely fake. In reality, his goal was to deceive her.</p>

  <p>At Naomi's announcement, the members of the Li Shan mountain who were at the Chaotic Source Realm continuously assembled in the stronghold. The majority of them had snake tails and were from the Snake Goddess race, while the others were humans.</p>

  <p>As the Li Shan mountain members continued to appear, Whitehead also kept an eye on them.</p>

  <p>The goal of the Star Falcon race was to capture a human woman called Yan.</p>

  <p>Thus, he needed to ensure that she was on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the dozens of human Souls of Light that were in the stronghold, Whitehead suddenly smiled and said, "I've heard that many new talents of Li Shan mountain have entered the Desire World this time.</p>

  <p>Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Naomi felt a bit confused. The creatures on the Other Shore rarely paid attention to the matters in the Source World because they were destined to stay on the Other Shore their whole lives. Yet, Whitehead appeared to know her race well.</p>

  <p>Despite her uncertainty, she politely replied, "Yes, they are very talented.</p>

  <p>They are promising." "Is Yan in the stronghold now?" Whitehead abruptly asked.</p>

  <p>Now, Naomi was even more confused. Yan had just entered Stage Fourteen not long ago. How did Whitehead know her?</p>

  <p>Still, she didn't think too much about the ape's intentions. She pointed towards the two human women nearby and said, "She's there."</p>

  <p>As soon as Yan and Natalie heard that a temple would be opened, they quickly came to the Other Shore together. Those who had just entered the Desire World were surely eager to get a good Other Shore Token, and of course, Yan and Natalie were no exception.</p>

  <p>One of the best ways for them to get such Other Shore Tokens was to explore temples. "What's wrong?" Natalie glanced at Naomi and asked.</p>

  <p>Beside her, Yan blinked and looked at the white-haired ape, as she too felt that something was off.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Whitehead's body unexpectedly flashed, and a handful of green sand appeared in his hand. He ran over to them and sprinkled the sand on both Yan and Natalie.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Yan and Natalie didn't even try to dodge. When they realized what had happened, the Soul Restraining Sand was already firmly stuck on their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>The commotion somewhat stunned all the other Souls of Light present, including Naomi. Then she angrily hissed, "Whitehead, what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>It was known that on the Other Shore, the acts of throwing things like the Soul Restraining Sand, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Binding Thread to other beings were seen as a declaration of war. The White Ape race, however, were in good terms with the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Thus, Whitehead had no reason to specifically attack Yan and Natalie at all.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." Whitehead apologized as he retreated out of the stronghold. At the same time, he waved his long white arms in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the six huge Star Falcons came down and stood upright behind Whitehead. Their sharp eyes emitted a ferocious and cold aura.</p>

  <p>As for Whitehead, he just continued to apologize, "I'm sorry, guys. I have to do this for the sake of White Ape race. I have to obey them?"</p>

  <p>Some of the members of the Li Shan mountain reacted quickly. When the Star Falcons landed, many Souls of Light from the Li Shan mountain had left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The others retreated as they wanted, but the Soul Restraining Sand stopped Yan and Natalie.</p>

  <p>"The Star Falcon race! We, the Li Shan mountain, have no conflict with you! Don't mess around! Otherwise... " Naomi shrieked. She could have left at her own will, but she stood in front of Yan and Natalie.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Before she could finish her words, a starry sword pierced her Soul of Light, passing through the space between Yan and Natalie, then finally penetrating the wall of the stronghold.</p>

  <p>"No, Naomi!"</p>

  <p>Natalie and Yan screamed as they saw Naomi's Soul of Light collapse.</p>
