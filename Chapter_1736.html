  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only wanted to teach the practitioners of the Breeze Sword School a lesson that they would not forget. He hadn't planned on taking their lives.</p>

  <p>Caiden's sincerity somehow managed to calm his anger, so he decided to let their rudeness pass.</p>

  <p>'But what can I do with these two nine-star tokens?' he wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>He knew that Caiden would lead him directly to the Sword Manor, so the sword tokens were no longer required for him to be allowed entrance.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, he placed the two sword tokens on the platform and addressed the warriors who had been curious at the commotion, "I'll leave the sword tokens to you. You may compete for them through fair sparring matches to see who deserve to take them."</p>

  <p>Elated, the warriors cheered excitedly upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>There weren't many of them present at that time, so they all had a good chance of obtaining a nine-star sword token. For these independent warriors, several hundred life vitality jades were a great fortune. They could instead save the money up to obtain more resources for cultivation!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was astonished at the warriors' fervent reaction at his words. Freya, on the contrary, just smiled softly and followed behind Luo Luo Zheng quietly as he approached Caiden.</p>

  <p>Caiden handed each of them a token that had a divine texture. It exempted the bearer from the no-flight ban surrounding the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people were restricted from flying at high altitudes in the area.</p>

  <p>The only people who dared to fly highly around the Sword Manor all had great backgrounds.</p>

  <p>Predictably, the headquarters of the Sword Manor was the enormous sword that Luo Luo Zheng and Freya had observed earlier.</p>

  <p>This gargantuan sword was actually a huge building. Even for martial artists, this building was indeed a colossal feat of architecture. It must have taken thousands of years to fully complete this building.</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Luo Zheng was finally shown to the top floor of the huge building.</p>

  <p>The colossal sword seemed to be stabbed into the ground, so the so-called top floor was at the very end of the hilt. From the perspective of an observer from afar, it looked like an emerald jade pearl was inlaid into the hilt of the sword.</p>

  <p>When he got closer, Luo Luo Zheng realized that this jade pearl was much bigger than what it seemed to him. It was almost the size of a hill. Its smooth surface was polished to a shine, and its inside was hollowed out skillfully into a large room. It was, no doubt, a masterpiece.</p>

  <p>Noticing Luo Zheng's look of total amazement, Caiden explained, "Actually, in the very beginning, the Sword Manor was located in the city. This sword-like building was erected after Supreme Lord Sword had already made himself known throughout the universe."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in acknowledgment. In this universe, the Supreme Lords had the highest level of power. With the size of the Sword Manor, producing a Supreme Lord like Supreme Lord Sword was indeed the peak of their power.</p>

  <p>After entering the hall within the huge pearl, Caiden motioned for Luo Luo Zheng to take a seat and ordered a maidservant to pour him a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>Freya had the impulse to stand behind Luo Luo Zheng? she really considered herself as Luo Zheng's handmaid and acted that way. However, Luo Luo Zheng asked her to sit next to him.</p>

  <p>She was very meticulous and always organized things well for Luo Luo Zheng, but he never treated her as his servant.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, a white-robed, middle-aged man slowly walked towards them from the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>The man walked with a steady pace, emanating an Mu Ning that was befitting of his strength as a world lord.</p>

  <p>The first man was followed by two similarly white-robed old men bearing swords on their backs, both also at world lord's level. Judging from their strengths, Luo Luo Zheng estimated that the over-all force of the Sword Manor was actually stronger than an ordinary tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Based on the grading standards for sects in the universe, a sacred place could achieve the highest grade of ten. But, disregarding that fact, Luo Luo Zheng thought that the Sword Manor could well be regarded as a twelfth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng inferred that the middle-aged man was Finch Bi, the head of Sword Manor, as Caiden had already familiarized Luo Luo Zheng with his name earlier.</p>

  <p>"It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir," Luo Luo Zheng greeted the older man with cupped hands as he stood from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Same here! Luo Luo Zheng, you're a young hero! The sword slash you performed in the Illusion Battlefield really impressed us all! Please call me by my first name, Finch." The older man was bold and direct.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and replied, "I'm honored."</p>

  <p>Finch was enthusiastic to meet Luo Luo Zheng, but not just because he had won first place in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>He was more interested about the matter that Caiden had reported to him? that Supreme Lord Sword might still be alive.</p>

  <p>After it had been known throughout the entire Humanity Alliance that Luo Luo Zheng was practicing the Gods-Intimidating Strike, the news had also traveled quickly to the Sword Manor. They had always been attentive to all news that might be related to the poem that Supreme Lord Sword had left on the giant rock.</p>

  <p>What message did Supreme Lord Sword encrypt in that poem? Was it an important secret? How did Luo Luo Zheng know that he was still alive?</p>

  <p>These were the questions that had been in the foremost of Finch's mind.</p>

  <p>For a force like the Sword Manor, losing a Supreme Lord was undoubtedly a big loss.</p>

  <p>Therefore, during the past years, the Sword Manor proclaimed that Supreme Lord Sword was missing instead of dead. At the very least, a missing Supreme Lord seemed much more intimidating instead of a dead one.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Sword's Crown of Destiny had disappeared from the universe, and it seemed that a new Crown of Destiny had taken its place. Knowing that, only those who were not aware of the matter believed the Sword Manor's statements.</p>

  <p>After the initial salutations, Finch went straight to the matter he was most concerned about. He didn't even bother to interrogate Luo Luo Zheng about his intentions for coming to Sword Manor, but instead asked, "As the current leader of the Sword Manor, I have one important thing to clarify with you. Caiden mentioned in his report that Supreme Lord Sword is still alive. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback; he hadn't expected that his careless comments earlier would strongly pique Finch's interest.</p>

  <p>He recalled seeing the soul mark of Supreme Lord Sword among the ranks of the True Gods in the Hall of Causality, and once again confirmed that there was a high probability that Supreme Lord Sword had become a True God.</p>

  <p>He nodded his head in acquiescence.</p>

  <p>Finch's expression briefly revealed his excitement. Although it sounded improbable, he would much rather believe that it was true.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, they were almost certain that Supreme Lord Sword had passed away, ever since his Crown of Destiny had disappeared. But Finch always held on to a glimmer of hope in his mind.</p>

  <p>"But that's impossible! After his Crown of Destiny disappeared, a new Supreme Lord from another race carried the Heavenly Destiny. There are only 128 Supreme Lords in the present universe. Is he really still alive?"  one of the old men behind Finch stepped forward and asked in an urgent tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grimaced a bit. The old man quickly presented the evidences to nullify his words but it was obvious that he was anticipating about Supreme Lord Sword's status. His self-contradicting words echoed the internal turmoil of the thoughts in his mind.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng understood how they felt as Supreme Lord Sword was an integral part of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>"It's true that Supreme Lord Sword is still alive," Luo Luo Zheng repeated. "As for his Crown of Destiny, it must have disappeared because he is no longer a Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?" Finch asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"He has become a True God," Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he proclaimed the words.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>"This is even more impossible!"</p>

  <p>"A Supreme Lord can never become a True God!"</p>

  <p>To become a True God in the universe, one must fulfill the condition of being a Godly Genius first.</p>

  <p>After the Supreme Lords carried the Heavenly Destiny, it was impossible for them to cultivate to become a True God, as the Heavenly Destiny already bound them to this universe. They could only cultivate to reach the limit in this universe set by the Heavenly Destiny, but they could never exceed that limit.</p>

  <p>The world lords found this to be more unbelievable than the fact that Supreme Lord Sword was still alive.</p>

  <p>Seeing their puzzled expressions, Luo Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and recounted to them all that he had observed in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"If you still can't believe me, I can prove the truth of my words with this," Luo Luo Zheng raised his arm to show them something.</p>

  <p>Soon, a sword-shaped mark materialized on his arm.</p>

  <p>When Finch and the two old men laid their eyes on the sword-shaped mark on Luo Zheng's arm, their facial expressions changed at the same time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was dumbfounded. Their astonishment was so exaggerated, it was almost comical. After all, they were three dignified world lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still hadn't realized the importance of the sword-shaped mark at that time.</p>

  <p>He thought it was only a token of the Supreme Lord's message so that his safety was ensured when he entered the Killing Sword Mountain to hone his swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>However, to the Sword Manor, this sword-shaped mark meant a great deal more than that!</p>
