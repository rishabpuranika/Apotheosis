<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 330 The Weapon Condensing Skill (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Out of his expectation, the process of condensation was more successful this time. Luo Luo Zheng saw Harrison withdrew the fire an hour later. He heard Harrison said, "Alas! It's done!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of Seventeenth Court who were standing nearby also cheered when they saw Harrison finished the condensation process.</p>

  <p>"Harrison, you did it!"</p>

  <p>"Come on! Let's open the weapon refining furnace and look at the first top-grade mysterious weapon of our Seventeenth Court!" someone said in an excited tone.</p>

  <p>Harrison walked towards the weapon refining furnace and took off its lid. Right now, the temperature in the furnace was quite high, so he had to condense a fire on his arm to protect himself from being burned in the high temperature of the furnace.</p>

  <p>When Harrison retracted his hand from the furnace, he was finally holding a sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The silver sword was shining, and it glittered under the ray of the sun.</p>

  <p>"It's an actual top-grade mysterious weapon! I'd like to name this sword the Water Seeking Sword!" Harrison said as he took the sword in his hand and looked at it carefully. His junior fellow disciples rushed to him like a swarm of bees trying to get a look at the top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng walked slowly towards Harrison. He complimented him with a smile on his face, "You did it, Harrison! You have refined a top-grade mysterious weapon."</p>

  <p>Harrison saw the casual glance that Luo Luo Zheng threw at the top-grade mysterious weapon he just refined. It seemed that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't really interested in it at all, so Harrison asked, "I have finished the condensation now. So, when will you use the weapon refining furnace to condense your weapon?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do it now," replied Luo Luo Zheng in a calm tone.</p>

  <p>Harrison stood aside and stretched out his hand, gesturing for Luo Luo Zheng to take over the furnace, "Take all the time you need."</p>

  <p>Harrison was also curious about what Luo Luo Zheng was about to do. He wanted to know what kind of weapon a non-weapon refiner could condense.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tapped his space ring gently and took a sword out of it.</p>

  <p>Harrison and other disciples of the Seventeenth Court were surprised at the sight of Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>As for weapon refiners, they had good eyes for any weapon that they saw.</p>

  <p>The sword in Luo Zheng's hand wasn't a common weapon although it hadn't been condensed. They knew the sword must be a masterpiece from a master of weapon refiner when they looked at it.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to put the sword into the weapon refining furnace, Harrison stretched out his hand again and stopped him. "Luo Luo Zheng, this sword in your hand is of extraordinary quality. If you ask a master of weapon refiner to condense it, you can get a top-grade spiritual weapon out of it!"</p>

  <p>What Harrison was trying to say was that Luo Luo Zheng shouldn't condense this sword himself. The latter wasn't a weapon refiner, so Harrison was afraid that he could just destroy the extraordinary sword if he condensed it himself.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to acquire such an extraordinary sword, Harrison thought that he could also afford a weapon refiner. A qualified weapon refiner could do the trick and condense a top-grade spiritual weapon. Just the thought made Harrison excited.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to waste his time and energy to ask someone just to condense the sword for him. If he wanted a top-grade spiritual weapon, he could just buy it. Moreover, he had the chance to get a top-grade spiritual weapon in the treasure house of White Emperor City. But he let that chance pass by and just chose two crystals instead.</p>

  <p>The reason he wanted to do it himself was to condense a fairy weapon with the use of the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>"Harrison, I appreciate your thoughtfulness. But I have to try it myself. I want to know whether I can succeed in condensing it or not," replied Luo Luo Zheng with a smile. Harrison felt sorry for the sword after he heard what Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed a prodigal young man. Even though it was an extraordinary sword, Luo Luo Zheng still wanted to condense it on his own without thinking what would happen to the sword if he failed.</p>

  <p>Weapons couldn't be condensed repeatedly. If Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't succeed in condensing it the first time, the sword would be ruined. Harrison still couldn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng wanted to condense the sword by himself. It all sounded to him like a joke.</p>

  <p>He wanted to stop Luo Luo Zheng from condensing this sword himself. However, he wasn't the owner of the sword after all, so he wouldn't be able to convince Luo Luo Zheng not to do it. And by the expression in Luo Zheng's face, there was nothing Harrison could do right now.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of the Seventeenth Court didn't know what else to say. Just like Harrison, some of them were resentful for Luo Zheng's decision to waste such an extraordinary sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just ignored the pitiful and angry looks of the disciples around him and put the sword in the weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, don't you need the fire to protect yourself from burning?" Harrison inquired in confusion. Harrison found another peculiarity of Luo Luo Zheng. He noticed that Luo Luo Zheng didn't get burned even if he put his hands in the furnace without any protection.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the temperature in this furnace is not too high, so I don't need to protect my arm with the fire," Luo Luo Zheng replied and smiled.</p>

  <p>Harrison was suddenly at loss for words.</p>

  <p>Although he knew Luo Luo Zheng was a man of great power when he delivered the life vitality to help him earlier, he didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng could stand such high temperature. There was underground lava connected at the bottom of the weapon refining furnace, and he just condensed a weapon with the fire in it. How could it be possible that the temperature in the furnace wasn't too high?</p>

  <p>The temperature was so high in the furnace right now that it might take only two seconds to make a pig roast if you threw one in it.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's arms weren't burned after he put the sword inside the furnace.</p>

  <p>There wasn't even a scratch on his arms. How was it even possible?</p>
