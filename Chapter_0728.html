<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eden had already comprehended 80% of Wind Law, and he practiced a wind-system cultivation method. Moreover, he had also grasped another type of Law. In other words, he had cultivated two different laws at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, Eden was not interested in showing off his achievements in laws.</p>

  <p>He only had one goal at the moment, and that was to vent.</p>

  <p>Seeing Eden charge at him like a wild beast, Benson's expression changed.</p>

  <p>The longsword in his hand lightly tapped the ground before he lifted his wrist.</p>

  <p>"Water Tornado!"</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff …"</p>

  <p>A water dragon came out from the battle stage and pounced toward Eden.</p>

  <p>The water tornado was moving at breakneck speed. Even a city wall would be destroyed by it in an instant. Yet, Eden did not stop, and he did not intend to dodge it. He actually rushed toward the water tornado.</p>

  <p>The moment Eden and the water tornado collided, his hands intersected and he began to attack the water tornado.</p>

  <p>The water dragon, which contained a great impact force, was simply unable to withstand a single blow from Eden. Eden, who was under the impact of the water dragon, rushed straight toward Benson.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Eden lunged at Benson.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Benson stomped his foot, and a water vein spread out. The instant the water vein spread out, it pushed Eden back a little. Eden missed his target. Nevertheless, he ignored Benson's trick and once again tried to grab him.</p>

  <p>This time, Benson rolled on the ground and avoided Eden.</p>

  <p>After getting up, Benson laid his sword horizontally, one hand holding the sword while the other gripped the sword hilt. He closed his eyes and muttered, "Bestow the power of the Sea God upon me; Infuse the will of pure water in me."</p>

  <p>"There's no chance." Eden's expression was calm. With a gentle breeze, his figure had already floated in front of Benson. He extended his hand and grabbed again. "Die!"</p>

  <p>He hadn't taken Benson seriously. Right now, he only wanted to kill Benson to unload the anger he felt in his heart.</p>

  <p>However, Benson was one of the Cloud Hall's top disciples and was not as weak as Eden thought.</p>

  <p>When Eden reached out his hand, Benson wielded his longsword!</p>

  <p>Even though Eden was much stronger than Benson, he was not Luo Zheng. He didn't have Zheng's abnormal physique. Eden would not be able to catch Benson's sword with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>He could only retreat.</p>

  <p>However, Eden's retreat did not mean that he had given up. After dodging Benson's sword, a mighty force wrapped around Eden, and his figure disappeared into the wind.</p>

  <p>"Wind Barrier!"</p>

  <p>Only by reaching a certain level of comprehension of the Wind Law would a cultivator be able to display the wind barrier and hide his figure in the wind.</p>

  <p>Benson knew that danger was in the wind.</p>

  <p>He pointed the longsword in his hand at the ground and drew a circle. When the tip of the sword was still on the ground, water ripples began to spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>Then Benson saw that quite a few water veins were floating to his right.</p>

  <p>"This way, break it for me!"</p>

  <p>Benson slashed with his sword, and at this time, a voice rang beside his ears. "You guessed wrong. What's more, I'm not interested in playing hide-and-seek with you."</p>

  <p>The moment he heard the voice, Benson leaped to the right, but it was too late. Eden had stretched his hand and grabbed him.</p>

  <p>Even though Benson had managed to pull away from Eden in time, half of his arm had been shredded by the wind blades in Eden's hand. His arm had thus been crippled!</p>

  <p>Cultivators who had entered the Internal Elixir Realm were extremely tenacious. Benson had experienced countless dangers in his life. Enduring the pain in his arm, he quickly retreated and began swinging his sword with his other hand.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff …"</p>

  <p>Another gust of wind blew. Before Benson could raise his sword, Eden had positioned himself in front of Benson and once again grabbed at him.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Benson's sword fell to the ground. His other arm was also crippled.</p>

  <p>"Is there any use in struggling?" Eden sneered. He raised both of his hands, and green wind blades came out from his wrists. "I'm not playing anymore.</p>

  <p>You will die." Then, he sent a palm flying toward Benson!</p>

  <p>Killing wasn't prohibited in the Martial Arts Contest, but the prerequisite was that the other party didn't admit defeat.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Zheng was so careful was that he was afraid of alerting Marilyn. If she were to discover that he was trying to kill her, his plan would be in vain once she admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>Eden's current situation was the same. He didn't want to give Benson any chance to admit defeat, so after crippling Benson's arms, he activated his killing move.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment, Benson gritted his teeth and bit down on the tip of his tongue, burning his blood essence to smithereens.</p>

  <p>While burning his blood essence, Benson circulated his life vitality, forming dark blue water curtains around him, thus blocking Eden.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>The dark blue water curtains were unable to withstand a single blow from Eden. They shattered in the next instant. However, Eden's attack had been delayed.</p>

  <p>At this time, Benson finally got a chance. He pulled away from Eden and retreated to the edge of the stage.</p>

  <p>"I admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Benson's words, Xiao removed the enchanted barrier and walked toward Benson.</p>

  <p>Eden clearly hadn't vented his anger enough. In Xiao's presence, he dashed over, giving a sinister laugh. "In the Martial Arts Contest, life and death are decided by fate. How can one admit defeat?" He still wanted to kill Benson.</p>

  <p>"Enough." Xiao's face darkened as he blocked Eden.</p>

  <p>Xiao was, after all, a Virtual Tribulation Realm expert, and Eden was unable to surpass one level to challenge him, so he could only give up.</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to kill Benson, his anger grew.</p>

  <p>"All right, both contenders need to leave the stage and wait for the next challenge. Eden, draw your card." Xiao's mustache twitched. Even though Eden was Eddie's son, he could not break the rules of the Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>Eden suppressed the irritation in his heart. His eyes lit up when he heard that Xiao wanted him to draw a card. If he could draw a challenge card, then he could challenge Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Eden walked over and began to draw a wooden card. After he pulled it out, he turned it over and saw that the word "exemption" was written on it.</p>

  <p>"Crack …"</p>

  <p>Eden didn't need such a card at all. He broke it in frustration.</p>

  <p>Then, he returned to the high platform without looking back.</p>

  <p>Eddie studied his son's angry expression and smiled, "You still can't control your anger."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Father teach me not to restrain myself?" Eden said dejectedly.</p>

  <p>Everyone's warrior spirit was different. Some cultivators became stronger when they were calm. And, for others, it was rage that drove them to their best. This was the nature of the warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>When angered, Eddie and Eden were able to unleash their greatest strength.</p>

  <p>Eddie shook his head and said, "The anger that I'm talking about can become your motivation. But you let it control your mind. It will not benefit you. You have to know how to be angry and how to use your anger."</p>

  <p>"Father is right," Eden nodded.</p>

  <p>He had already decided. It didn't matter if his level was much higher than Zheng's. As long as he drew the first challenge card, he would challenge Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, just as Xiao was preparing for the next battle, Luo Zheng shouted,</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at Luo Zheng in confusion. Although he had returned to Cloud Hall's platform, he seemed preoccupied.</p>

  <p>Xiao asked, "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I want to use my challenge card." Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>"Who do you want to challenge?" Xiao and Ning Yudie asked simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were focused on Luo Zheng. He was the first person to use a challenge card in the Martial Arts Contest. No one knew who Luo Zheng wanted to challenge.</p>

  <p>'Could it be Marilyn?' Ning Yudie frowned as she thought about it.</p>

  <p>Brent's eyes were full of expectation. "Choose me. Let it be me!" He had been waiting for his turn for so long. It was already very depressing.</p>

  <p>"I want to challenge an independent warrior, Eden Cui!" Luo Zheng took out his challenge card and pointed to the platform where Evil East Lord was standing.</p>

  <p>"Challenge me?" Eden was stunned for a moment. He had just been thinking of getting the challenge card and getting rid of Luo Zheng! Who would've thought that Luo Zheng would challenge him before these thoughts even left his mind?</p>

  <p>'Do I look weak? Why does he dare to challenge me?' Eden wondered.</p>

  <p>Although Eden was very willing to let Luo Zheng challenge him, he was annoyed by that thought.</p>
