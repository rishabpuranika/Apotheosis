  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was the truth. Although the others couldn't hear the life vitality sound transmission, they could still feel it.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord was very sensitive to life vitality.</p>

  <p>He was unable to detect any life vitality fluctuations around Yolande and Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord nodded and looked impressed. A martial artist's vision was often very important.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and flicked the Cold Plum Blood Spear, and the spear went spinning towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng grabbed the spear and studied it closely. He discovered that there were faint traces of plum blossoms on the shaft of the spear.</p>

  <p>A trace of chaotic energy emitted from his palm and got absorbed within Cold Plum Blood Spear silently.</p>

  <p>The plum blossoms on the shaft gradually revealed themselves, turning into streaks of blood-red plum blossoms. Under the blood light, they bloomed to become more vivid and glistened, while at the same time, they exuded an aura from remote ages. Since the name of the spear had the word "blood" in it, there must be a story behind it.</p>

  <p>"Eh? How is your life vitality so refined? The color of the plum blossoms that is activated is so bright." The Sunset World lord had a strange expression on his face.</p>

  <p>With his cultivation as a world lord, the life vitality he had accumulated was countless times greater than that of a kid at the Life and Death Realm. However, even he was unable to awaken the ancient blood to this extent. So how did Zheng do it?</p>

  <p>It was only possible if Zheng also possessed a strand of ancient blood, which was able to interact with the ancient blood within the spear.</p>

  <p>However, the Sunset World lord was unable to detect the aura of an ancient bloodline from Zheng's body. He was bewildered now.</p>

  <p>All talents had their own secrets. For example, Zheng was able to fly 36, 000 miles relying only on his own physical strength. What abilities did he have that allowed him to travel so far? It was a mystery. And the Sunset World lord didn't intend to probe.</p>

  <p>The other palace heads also looked at the spear in Zheng's hands with a trace of envy in their eyes.</p>

  <p>The weapons held by the palace heads were somewhat on par with Zheng's spear. How could anyone not envy this kid who had obtained such a powerful weapon at this level?</p>

  <p>"Sir, do tell us what is the reward for traveling 30, 000 miles?" Yolande cut in again.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord chuckled in response and said, "I will reveal it to Zheng when the Passing the Torch ends!"</p>

  <p>Unlike the Celestial Position's Tower of Crystal, Passing the Torch was a pure trial, and this trial was divided into two parts. The first part was the Enchanted Barrier Tower, and the second was the Illusion Challenge.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Layla descended from the top floor and returned to the group of martial practitioners.</p>

  <p>He found a corner and sat down. Layla sat beside him.</p>

  <p>Many of the martial artists in the thirteen palaces now knew why Layla had only allowed Zheng to sit beside her when she was meditating on the stone carving.</p>

  <p>Everyone sighed silently in their hearts. Indeed, among the younger generation, there weren't many who were qualified enough to sit next to Layla. And Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the old man in cotton clothes, who was floating in the air, spoke in his aged voice.</p>

  <p>"Warriors of the thirteen palaces will enter the Illusion Space next. The Illusion Battlefield will be opened soon, and this time, the Illusion Space trial will be a rehearsal for the Illusion Battlefield. So everyone, work hard!"</p>

  <p>The old man then led the way, and the martial artists of the thirteen palaces stood up and followed him.</p>

  <p>Layla's face was as calm as still water, but there was uncontrollable excitement in her heart.</p>

  <p>She had already been defeated in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>She just had to win in the Illusion Space trial!</p>

  <p>It was very difficult to make her concede defeat. After confirming her fate, she had to work ten times harder than other martial artists!</p>

  <p>She wasn't willing to play just a supporting role in this battle of worlds.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng was an obstacle that the heavens had arranged for her. His sudden appearance in her life was no coincidence, nor was the fact that he was more powerful than her.</p>

  <p>'I will definitely beat you in this battle!' she promised herself.</p>

  <p>Layla's eyes flickered as she looked at Zheng. Thanks to her determination, she was unwittingly radiating a decisive aura, causing other warriors to turn to watch her.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only one who did not turn around. He strutted off in front of Layla, but the corners of his mouth turned up slightly.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Space was built within an ancient palace on Willow Island.</p>

  <p>It was not far from the Enchanted Barrier Tower. Soon, everyone arrived at the venue.</p>

  <p>"Get into groups of two hundred! Go into the Illusion Space. The trial begins." After the old man in cotton clothes finished speaking, he took out a namelist. He casually swiped his finger across the namelist and drew out the names of 200 martial artists.</p>

  <p>One by one, golden names appeared above everyone's heads.</p>

  <p>When the warriors saw their names, they stepped forward and entered the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>Afterwards they sat down cross-legged.</p>

  <p>Zheng had only entered the Illusion Space once and knew that once they sat down, their images would appear in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>He looked at Layla who was sitting beside him.</p>

  <p>She took the initiative. "What do you want to know? Don't tell me you've never entered the Illusion Space before."</p>

  <p>She knew that Zheng had ascended from the Lower World, and that he had only spent a short duration of time in the Upper World, so it was very likely that he had never been to the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and said, "I've been there once, but what is Illusion Battlefield?"</p>

  <p>Layla laughed lightly, "Illusion Battlefield will only be open in a few more years!"</p>

  <p>"What happens once it opens?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It's simple! All of the talents in the universe, including the future world lords, successors to Supreme Lords, and even some of the reclusive talents will participate." Layla added, laughing, "Actually, I've never seen it either. Nor has any of the creatures of this grand era."</p>

  <p>"What? Nobody has seen it before?" Zheng was taken aback.</p>

  <p>A single grand era was 3.6 billion years, and it was said that when a grand era ended, it would often be accompanied by great extinction.</p>

  <p>Countless living creatures in the universe would be destroyed during the extinction. Only when the next grand era began would life slowly bloom again.</p>

  <p>The universe had witnessed many grand eras. It was unknown just how many cycles it had gone through.</p>

  <p>The end of a grand era would cause even the heavens to collapse. The Heavenly Fragment Zheng had was a fragment of the previous heavens, which had collapsed at the end of the last grand era.</p>

  <p>Only a small number of supreme experts would be able to survive the last grand era and go on to the next by surviving the extinction period.</p>

  <p>"What's so strange about that? It's said that the Illusion Battlefield has always opened during the war of the worlds. Perhaps, it is a prelude to the chaos worlds." Layla thought this was common knowledge, but it was necessary to elucidate to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Now, everyone's attention was on the trial in the ancient hall.</p>

  <p>Under the instructions of the old man, a row of Picture Slabs were hung up for people to watch the trial in the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>The two hundred people entering the Illusion Space together were definitely not going to fight with each other at the same time.</p>

  <p>It was only when the Picture Slabs were hung up that Zheng clearly saw that the warriors had been continuously accepting challenges after entering the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Soon, martial artists were getting eliminated from the competition. Their projections died in the Illusion Space. When the original bodies opened their eyes, they dejectedly left the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>Over time, the challenge became more and more difficult, and more and more people exited the area.</p>

  <p>The last person endured a total of eleven rounds before his projection finally perished in the Illusion Space. When he opened his eyes, he discovered that he was the only person left in the ancient palace. A smug look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>When all two hundred of them had left the ancient hall, the old man shook his head and said, "Even the one with the best results in this round has only accepted eleven challenges. This is quite disappointing."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the old man's opinion of the two hundred warriors was not high. He didn't even announce the name of the warrior who took the first place.</p>
