  <p>Luo Zheng had admitted his identity in front of the Holy Beings in a straightforward manner.</p>

  <p>And the True Gods immediately burst into an uproar.</p>

  <p>"He is the son of Holy Mike!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder he is so strong!"</p>

  <p>"So what if he is the son of a Holy Emperor? Your father is a Holy Emperor, and so is mine!"</p>

  <p>More than a third of the True Gods present were descendants of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Outside of the Floating Islands, a child of a Holy Being was rare. But that wasn't the case on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, however, there was a huge gap between Luo Zheng and other descendants of the Holy Emperors.</p>

  <p>Liusu balled her hands into tight fists, her clothes soaking with sweat.</p>

  <p>She didn't know what Luo Zheng would have to face after admitting his true identity.</p>

  <p>Nelly, on the other hand, was quite calm. She merely pursed her thin lips and frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Mike's son is frank. Just as expected," Nicholas said appreciatively.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still, his face a mask of calm.</p>

  <p>"If you want to join our Dongfang Clan, I will put aside the conflict between Mike and me and accept you as my disciple. What do you think?" Nicholas said, smiling.</p>

  <p>At this, many Holy Beings were confused, unable to understand what was on Nicholas' mind.</p>

  <p>Previously, Nicholas had wanted to accept Luo Zheng as his disciple before he had known his real identity.</p>

  <p>It was understandable because anyone would be willing to accept a genius like Luo Zheng as a disciple.</p>

  <p>But he was Mike's son.</p>

  <p>And Mike and Nicholas were enemies!</p>

  <p>If he were to take Luo Zheng as a disciple, knowing his origin, wouldn't he be nurturing a snake in his bosom?</p>

  <p>The True Gods were whispering among themselves.</p>

  <p>"This guy is really lucky!"</p>

  <p>"The Holy Emperor of the Dongfang Clan is willing to accept him as a disciple, regardless of previous grievances!"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was dead for sure!"</p>

  <p>Liusu fixed her eyes on Luo Zheng and hoped that he would agree. Nicholas wasn't doing this out of goodwill, but it was the only choice Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>But judging by what she knew of Luo Zheng's character, she was certain that he would reject Nicholas' offer.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' words had surprised Luo Zheng as well. He looked up at him and said calmly, "It's an honor to be accepted as a disciple by the Holy Emperor of Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded, looking as gentle as a spring breeze.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your kindness, Holy Nicholas, but I don't want it," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>As soon as these words left his mouth, most of those present looked at him, shocked, as if he was an idiot to reject Nicholas' offer.</p>

  <p>According to them, Luo Zheng was a prisoner awaiting execution. It was not easy to get an opportunity as this, especially not for ordinary people. And yet, he was refusing it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>This was suicidal.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' face hardened at Luo Zheng's words. He asked in a steady tone,</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flashed a mocking smile at him.</p>

  <p>He rolled his eyes and stared at Nicholas, releasing his pent up hatred in the process.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes shone with a killing intent as he said rather calmly, "You tried to kill my father and destroy our Luo Clan. There is a historic enmity between us. I,  Luo Zheng Luo, am a child of Mike. I have vowed to avenge my father and the Luo Clan. How can I accept our deadly enemy as my master?"</p>

  <p>His aura was far inferior when compared to that of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>And his power was much weaker than a Holy Being's.</p>

  <p>But he had a firm state of mind within his aura, even if he was weak, strength-wise.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>'This guy is too bold!' they all thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>The only person who could compare to Luo Zheng in character was Harold.</p>

  <p>But Harold's arrogance stemmed from the fact that he could take control of the Everest Spirit Mountain. If he remained in the mountain and didn't get out, the Holy Emperors wouldn't be able to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just a low-rank True God, yet he had run to these Holy Beings with the mere intention of provoking them. He was brash and arrogant.</p>

  <p>"Is he asking for death?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. As you said, he thought that threatening the Holy Beings with the lives of the consummate True Gods was a good idea."</p>

  <p>"Think about it. If he could easily kill the consummate True Gods, it would be a real loss for the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the Sword Clan, the Moon Clan, and other clans watched the scene, enjoying it immensely.</p>

  <p>But the Holy Beings from the Dongfang Clan, the Tang Clan, the Fang Clan, and other clans who were against the Luo Clan, looked shocked, before they burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"This little guy!"</p>

  <p>"Mike is a capable man!"</p>

  <p>According to these Holy Beings, Luo Zheng was outstanding, but his strength was something that could be ignored.</p>

  <p>What was more, before the Mountain of Holy Beings had appeared, all True Gods could only cultivate to consummation, and consummate True Gods could hardly fight a Holy Being. This meant that no matter how powerful Luo Zheng's talent was, he would not be a threat to these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng's words meant as little as an innocent six-year-old child's words to these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>There was no anger on Nicholas' face. He stared at Luo Zheng indifferently and said, "Do you think you have a chance? Or are you confident that you can leave this place?"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng, a low-rank True God, could escape from these Holy Beings, it would be a great shame to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly raised his right hand so everybody could see it. "I can leave with the help of this!" he said calmly.</p>

  <p>There was a small black snake engraved on his hand, made from the jade seal. "Walton Tang, Rachelle Mu, Shahn Fang, Troy Dongfang... Are you cruel enough to ignore the lives of these consummate True Gods?"</p>

  <p>The expressions on the faces of the Holy Beings shifted at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to produce a consummate True God. Most powerful clans only had one or two consummate True Gods, and they were the leaders of almost all the powerful clans. These consummate True Gods held very important positions in their respective clans.</p>

  <p>"I've controlled space and time in the jade seal, so that it's now easy to kill them," Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>Although he appeared to be calm, he was inwardly very nervous.</p>

  <p>The lives of the consummate True Gods were the only things that Luo Zheng could rely on now.</p>

  <p>"Boy, we, the Sword Clan, have no enmity with you. Release Mikail!" a Holy Being of the Sword Clan said as he glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised a hand towards the Holy Being and said, "Mikail was killed before I entered the jade seal. All that is left of him is a pile of bones."</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the Sword Clan paled collectively.</p>

  <p>"Given the chance, I will return his bones," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to offend any other powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"Young man, if you dare hurt Walton, even in the slightest of ways, I will not leave you alone," said Clark grimly.</p>

  <p>"Then it all depends on whether you'll let me go. If I can leave safely from here, I'll ensure that these people are safe," Luo Zheng countered.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings fell silent. Some of them turned their gazes to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had become tricky to deal with after he had obtained the Jade Seal.</p>

  <p>Did they really need to sacrifice so many consummate True Gods for the sake of one low-rank True God?</p>

  <p>Joy was relieved at how the Holy Beings were reacting. She hadn't expected things to go so far.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng could really escape from the Holy Beings by threatening them with the lives of the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>As Joy contemplated this, Nicholas opened his mouth to speak. A mocking smile appeared on his face as he said, "As you said, you do have the lives of more than twenty consummate True Gods in your hands. But there's only one person of our Dongfang Clan who is under your control and that is Troy. I won't be threatened by anyone, and I don't care one bit what happens to him!"</p>

  <p>Nelly and the three girls of Han Clan were shocked at this. Joy's heart sank as well.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' words meant that the only bargaining chip Luo Zheng had was now of no use.</p>
