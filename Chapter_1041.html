  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea how this power was formed. He couldn't even feel the waves of life vitality within it.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of power this young man used, Luo Zheng had to go all out to fight him.</p>

  <p>The light quickly spread towards Luo Zheng, who concentrated with all his might and activated all the power of the stars that he could muster.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the power of the dragon scales that had begun to simmer erupted with a mighty boom.</p>

  <p>The collective force of his power was enough to destroy a mountain range or cut off a river in its path.</p>

  <p>But only when the light circles reached Luo Zheng did he realize the difference between him and this young man.</p>

  <p>The light circles looked peaceful. People couldn't even feel the energy contained within them. But the moment Luo Zheng touched them, he felt a formidable force radiating from them.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't be able to shake them off even if his strength increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The first light circle suddenly exploded, and the rest followed in close succession.</p>

  <p>The energy within the light circles should have been enough to destroy the whole of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. But instead of spreading in all directions as it should have, it was behaving strangely and went directly towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>There was another ringing sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was sent flying backwards like an arrow. He flew past the Ethereal Spirit Hall, the entire Ethereal Spirit Sect, the plains, and the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, having been pushed by this powerful force, flew at a speed that was 20 times faster than when he flew with the burst of his life vitality and forceful energy. He had now managed to travel several hundred miles in a matter of a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally crashed into a lush forest, colliding and crashing through hundreds of trees before he finally came to a stop.</p>

  <p>The forest had become a mess. If one looked at the expanse from above, one could see a small path appear at the edge of the forest and gradually make its way inward. Broken tree trunks littered this path.</p>

  <p>This small path was one that Zheng's body had carved during his descent.</p>

  <p>A killer weasel stealthily ran across the forest. It was small in size, but was actually a ferocious third grade beast. Its gaze rested on Luo Zheng for a few seconds before it disappeared into the depths of the forest. The Mu Ning that Zheng's body was emitting clearly told it that he was not someone that it could provoke.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a long time trying to suppress the shock he was feeling as he lay prostate on the forest floor, but in vain. Had it just been one ten-millionth of his total strength? If the young man used his full strength, wouldn't he be able to destroy this boundless world with just a wave of his hand?</p>

  <p>The energy from the life circles had only sent Luo Zheng flying. But if the energy hadn't been attacking his body evenly, he wouldn't have been able to withstand it despite his body being a fairy weapon. He would probably have exploded and turned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Why would he come here? Why must he take Yan away?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't figure it all out.</p>

  <p>A stunned silence had enveloped Dillon, Hobbes, and the other members in the Ethereal Spirit Hall. This guy who had emerged out of nowhere had turned out to be a freak!</p>

  <p>Warriors could only be intimidated by someone who was much more powerful than them. The young man standing in front of them was far beyond their imagination. When Luo Zheng had first arrived at the Sea God Continent, he had met a tribe of humans who had been kept in captivity in the ogres' pastures. And in the hearts of Craig and the others, Luo Zheng was a true God, with all kinds of supernatural abilities.</p>

  <p>And this young man was to them what Luo Zheng was to the human tribe. He was like a true god in the eyes of Dillon and the others.</p>

  <p>Every martial artist in the Ethereal Spirit Hall looked at the young man with awe and reverence. They seemed to be holding a collective breath out of fear, and didn't dare speak.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, this young man was very gentle. He smiled at everyone and shook his head before he said, "I accidentally used a bit too much strength, probably three ten-millionth of all my power. Controlling my strength is quite difficult at times."</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts twitched at his words. What kind of freak was he?</p>

  <p>Looking at their nervous faces, the young man turned to Dillon and said,</p>

  <p>"You guys look very nervous."</p>

  <p>Dillon forced a smile and shook his head. "No, not at all!"</p>

  <p>"That's good. Like I said, how can a kind person like me make others feel nervous?" the young man said rather self-righteously.</p>

  <p>Dillon didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he was furious from within.</p>

  <p>'How dare you call yourself kind? You're like a giant beast appearing in front of a human child. How could the child feel any kindness from the beast?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad. Looks like I pushed that brat too far. Come back!" The young man stretched out his hand towards the entrance of the Ethereal Spirit Hall and twisted the air. An invisible force spread forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was now hundreds of miles away, had just stood up when he felt a formless force enveloping him. He was dragged so that he was floating in the air and felt a pull that told him he was about to be transported. Then he was flying madly towards the Ethereal Spirit Sect. A few seconds later, he was standing in the Ethereal Spirit Hall.</p>

  <p>In another blink of the eye, he'd traveled several hundred miles yet again and was back within the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Luo Zheng couldn't believe that he had actually returned. It felt so unreal.</p>

  <p>The young man smiled at Luo Zheng and asked, "How do you feel?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow and replied, "Very good!"</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, I'll take Yan away," the young man said and began walking towards Yan.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Luo Zheng said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>The young man turned around and looked at Luo Zheng, and then asked, "What do you want? You can't stop me anyway!"</p>

  <p>"Yan and I have been separated for a long time. Can you help me remove her seal? I need to talk to her for a while." Since there was such a huge difference in their strengths, Luo Zheng finally chose to give in. Even if Zheng's strength increased a hundred or even a thousand times, he still wouldn't be able to match this young man.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Luo Zheng did not feel any wicked intentions from this young man. If he wanted to kill him, Luo Zheng would have died a thousand times over in this short period of time. But this young man had only showcased his powerful strength and even saved Yan from Eden.</p>

  <p>As to the reason, he would ask Xun about it later.</p>

  <p>The young man thought for a moment, and then said, "I will give you five minutes." Saying thus, he tapped the spot between Yan's brows, causing her mouth, nose, eyes, and ears to emit a faint glow. He had removed Yan's seal in an instant.</p>

  <p>Watching him unlock the sealing of the six senses so easily, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance couldn't help but raise their eyebrows.</p>

  <p>This technique was truly inconceivable.</p>

  <p>The Six Senses Blocking Method was a kind of cultivation technique. Eddie had mastered this technique, and so had the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>But this technique had some unexpected effects on the warrior spirit of the cultivators, and was also rather troublesome to use, which was why the World Commercial Alliance rarely used it.</p>

  <p>Using this method to bring a few warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm to the World Commercial Alliance was meaningless. However, if it was for the Lustful Demon Array, this secret technique could be very valuable for Eddie.</p>

  <p>The process of sealing the six senses was extremely troublesome, and unsealing the six senses was similarly extremely complicated. If they were to bring Yan back, it was likely that they would have to take great efforts and spend at least several months before they could unlock the sealing.</p>

  <p>But this young man had carelessly waved his hand and solved the problem in the blink of an eye. It was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>Yan immediately woke up, her eyelids twitching before she opened her eyes. People could see the confusion in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Her six senses had been sealed for over two years, and even though she had been constantly cultivating during these two years, her entire body and mind had been sealed. If martial artists who were over a hundred years old had been treated the way Yan had been treated, the sealing probably wouldn't have had much of an impact on them. After all, in the long years of a warrior's life, it was common for a martial artist to go into closed-door cultivation for ten years, or even a hundred years.</p>

  <p>However, Yan was still young. In her short life so far, she had spent one-tenth of her time with her six senses sealed. This would have a negative impact on her body and mind.</p>

  <p>She was at a loss now, her mind filled with doubt as she looked at the strange surroundings and the strange faces in front of her.</p>

  <p>A familiar figure suddenly entered her sight, filling her oval face with surprise. She finally opened her mouth and called out to Luo Zheng. "Brother..."</p>
