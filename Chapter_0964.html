  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Brent had finished laughing to his heart's content, his face turned serious once more as he spoke, "Today, in the Ethereal Spirit Sect, my master told me that he is not going to just let you continue to act however you please!"</p>

  <p>The master Brent was speaking of was the leader of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, Xander.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for Xander, how could anyone tolerate Margaret's extremely obstinate behavior?</p>

  <p>Even though Xander always tolerated his wishful great granddaughter and let her get away with everything, the people of the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the Ethereal City criticized him severely for that. The situation was becoming very grave and it was time he prioritized the overall situation over her. All he had to do was sacrifice a girl of the Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>And in any case, the girl had to get married, and there were so many young talented men for her to choose from!</p>

  <p id="top_15">"Did great grandpa really say that?" Upon hearing Brent's words, a trace of sadness appeared across her face.</p>

  <p>Brent was a year younger than Mu Ning, but since he was still training in the Ethereal Spirit Sect, his thoughts were more mature than that of the latter. To comfort her, he told her, "Mu Ning, the master is under a lot of pressure too these days. Judging by the current situation, I'm fairly certain that Eddie is planning to make a move any time now!"</p>

  <p>"How dare he! Hang on! Look, our Ethereal Spirit Sect is the number one sect in the entire Central Region. If Eddie is really planning to make a move, he isn't going to attack this place first." Mu Ning was initially about to rise up in anger but her thought seemed to calm her down.</p>

  <p>Brent smiled helplessly and asked, "Why do you think that he won't attack the Ethereal Spirit Sect? The top three powers in the Central Region are the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the World Commercial Alliance, and the Cloud Hall. If the Heavenly Evil Sect wants to take action, they will definitely aim at any one of these three great powers. Now, let's weigh the possibility of Eddie attacking us, shall we? The World Commercial Alliance has an Ancient Tycoon to protect the place, and the Oracle City is a place that won't be easily taken down and help will arrive before something can happen. As for the Cloud Hall... That Cloudy City is nothing to be reckoned with, but there is an extremely formidable sect-protecting array in the Cloud Hall, and it would be hard for the Heavenly Evil Sect to take the city with that still in place. Although our Ethereal Spirit Sect is known as the strongest sect in the Central Region, but compared to the other two sects, we are the easiest target and most probably he would take us on first!"</p>

  <p>Brent's analysis was indeed very reasonable.</p>

  <p>The force of the World Commercial Alliance would be highly intimidating for Eddie even today. As for the Cloud Hall, he had already suffered greatly from its sect-protecting array when he had tried to seek revenge for his son once. Relatively speaking, if he wanted to start a war among the sects, the safest option would be finding a way to break through into the Ethereal Spirit Sect first. Moreover, the Ethereal Spirit Sect had the reputation of being the strongest of all sects in the Central Region. If Eddie could take down the Ethereal Spirit Sect, a large number of independent warriors would surely join the Heavenly Evil Sect!</p>

  <p>"If Eddie comes and attacks the Ethereal City, you might not be the biggest cause of the war, but you will definitely be one of the reasons for the attack." Brent continued in a serious tone, "If you marry someone, then Eddie will give up his hope of taking you away and making you his third Purple Power Body. At least when the Heavenly Evil Sect attacks us, no one will blame you!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning looked gentle and calm in her demeanor, as beautiful and graceful as an orchid in a deep valley. On the surface, she seemed to be so meek and mile, giving others the impression that she was an obedient girl. But deep inside, she was stubborn and obstinate, always sticking to her own ideas. After hearing Brent preach with that serious expression on his face, she became a little annoyed and suddenly blurted out, "So what if they blame it on me? The worst would be that I just die. I don't care if that happens!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Brent knew that it was impossible to get it through to her, so he finally gave up. "Mu Ning, I'm afraid that when the worst scenario really happens, you won't be able to find death even if you wish to."</p>

  <p>This sentence seemed to shake Mu Ning a bit. Her heart jolted when she thought of the possibilities of her fate. Her body trembled a bit as panic began to seize her and she suddenly felt at a loss and didn't know how to respond.</p>

  <p>Eddie was known as both righteous and evil. It was easy for her to imagine what would become of her if she fell into his hands.</p>

  <p>However, the panic only flashed in her eyes for a moment, and soon enough, a vicious grin appeared on her face. She clenched her teeth and made a decision. "If that's the case, I will prepare a poison. If Eddie really comes, I will take the poison and commit suicide."</p>

  <p>In the end, Brent sighed and left the place with the other two servants.</p>

  <p>The next day, in the earliest possible hour of the morning, a young man dressed in a green robe appeared on the square in front of the castle of Xi Clan. It had been very late when he had arrived at the Ethereal City yesterday. So he had stayed for a good night's rest before going to the castle of Xi Clan. When dawn finally began to show in the morning, he immediately traveled halfway across the Ethereal City towards the castle.</p>

  <p>Just as he arrived at the square in front of the gate of the castle, he saw numerous people line up there. The line was so long that it looked like a long dragon that extended hundreds of feet from head to tail. There were over a hundred people in the square.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of people in the crowd. There were strong and sturdy men, and scholarly men who were dressed up elegantly and with refined manners. As for their cultivation levels, they varied greatly.</p>

  <p>There were common people without any cultivation base at all, and also powerful warriors from the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>
