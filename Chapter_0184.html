<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 184 The Shura Battlefield (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>He walked back and forth for dozens of steps and tried to operate his life energy at the same time. Finally, Luo Luo Zheng felt as though he was fine.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had been in a dreamless state, he remembered what happened before.</p>

  <p>He had faced six demon generals and fought against them, risking his life. He had used his demonic life energy and killed them all.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng had the body of a spiritual weapon, it was difficult for him to recover after being severely injured by the bone spurs from the demon generals.</p>

  <p>Before his strength and senses became weak, Luo Luo Zheng remembered that countless tiny silver swords had fallen from the sky and stabbed the demon general...</p>

  <p>While thinking back, he remembered that he had been trying to save an inner disciple named Nina.</p>

  <p>Just at this time, the door opened. A lady dressed in a light purple dress stood at the doorway. A thin, long golden hairpin glimmered in her hair.</p>

  <p>She looked so pure and beautiful that Luo Luo Zheng was in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Why do you look at me in this way?" The lady smiled at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked and finally dared to confirm after hearing her voice, "Are you Nina Zhu?"</p>

  <p>It was said that the woman changed fast in physical appearance. She had been dressed in a black robe when Luo Luo Zheng had first met Nina. Now, she was dressed in regular clothes.</p>

  <p>Nina smiled and said in a low voice, "Please, call me Nina." A crimson blush crept on Nina's face. Till now, she had not asked a man to address her intimately.</p>

  <p>"Nina," Luo Luo Zheng said with a nod. he hadn't thought that calling a woman by her name was unusual.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" Luo Luo Zheng looked out the window as he spoke. Several tall white buildings filled his view. The environment was strange to him.</p>

  <p>Nina laughed before she said, "Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Then she turned and left the room. With a small smile, Luo Luo Zheng followed. On the way, Nina told Luo Luo Zheng, "This is the White Emperor City!"</p>

  <p>"White Emperor City? Is this the White Emperor City that is guarded by millions of soldiers of the Imperial Army?" While speaking Luo Luo Zheng turned his head and looked around. He had read in a book that White Emperor City was made of dolostone and looked snow-white because of the stone's characteristic white color. The city also defended the Shura region...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had hence, learned something about White Emperor City before. He knew that it was made of dolostone and was very magnificent.</p>

  <p>Now that he had the chance to see the city, Luo Luo Zheng was left in awe. It was a hundred times better than what people had described it to be. Moreover, the brilliance of the white architecture shocked him.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's stunned expression, Nina covered her mouth and chuckled.</p>

  <p>Then she pulled Luo Luo Zheng by the arm. As they passed a bend in the road, they reached the top of the city wall.</p>

  <p>White Emperor City was founded on a large mountain. As it was a military fortress, the land had been flattened to accommodate the city.</p>

  <p>Since the city wall was built with the natural geographical difference of the high mountain, when they stood on the city wall, they were on the mountain top.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gazed into the distance. The scene before him left him wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"This is the Shura Battlefield!" Luo Luo Zheng whispered.</p>

  <p>In the distance, there was a black crack which split the heavens and the earth. It was the strangest thing that Luo Luo Zheng had seen! He watched as lightning curled around it from time to time.</p>

  <p>It was said that this crack had been opened by the great avatar of the demon, which broke the fence between the two spaces.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, humans had almost killed all the demons that had walked out of the crack. However, humans were overwhelmed by the size of the crack.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew how to repair this space crack.</p>

  <p>As long as this space crack remained open, demons would hide among humans.</p>

  <p>The vast land not far from the White Emperor City was shrouded in darkness. This was where the demon soldiers and generals banded together!</p>

  <p>The Imperial Army in the White Emperor City fought at close quarters against the demon soldiers and generals all day long to resist their invasion.</p>

  <p>"Everybody says that the defense of the White Emperor City is as strong as iron and that no demon generals can get past it. So why are there so many demon generals in the Sky Forest?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Nina answered, "Have a look. The Heaven Tower and the Earth Tower have fallen. This is why the demon generals sneak into the forest..."</p>

  <p>"It appears that White Emperor City is in trouble." Luo Luo Zheng questioned as he observed the demon soldiers and generals gathering in the darkened land.</p>

  <p>Nina nodded, "That is not the only trouble we face. My uncle said that the demons had sent four demon kings this time! In the entire history of the battle between humans and demons, such a thing has not happened.</p>

  <p>They probably want to take White Emperor City in one fight!"</p>

  <p>If White Emperor City fell, the path of the demons would be smooth.</p>

  <p>The demon army would destroy everything on its way and invade the Burning Sky Imperial Capital!</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's anxiety, Nina smiled and asked, "Are you worried?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed, "Why should I be worried? If the sky falls, the tall guys will resist it. The demon king is powerful, but the humans of our Eastern Region are not weak!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's explanation was reasonable. The demons had called in an unprecedented army, but Burning Sky Empire had also sent many overmatches to the battlefield. White Emperor City had defended the battleground for many years, and this was not the first time that they were facing a crisis. Living in White Emperor City meant facing danger every day. So this situation was not an exception.</p>

  <p>"By the way, we managed to leave Sky Forest safely enough. But where are the other disciples of Cloud Sect?" Compared with the safety of White Emperor City, Luo Luo Zheng was more worried about the well-being of the disciples.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Because there were demon generals in the Sky Forest, White Emperor City sent people to collect all the disciples in the forest. I will take you to see them!"</p>

  <p>In no time, Nina brought Luo Luo Zheng to the temporary residence of the disciples.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng entered the spacious camp, he saw Cleve, Henry, and the others.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Are you all right?" Cleve became excited when he saw Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Luo Zheng was alive. They also knew that he had been in recovery for the past two days since his injuries were critical. They were naturally concerned about his recovery.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shrugged and smiled, "See, I am OK!"</p>

  <p>At the moment, Lenard and the others from the Skytop Peak stepped forward and surrounded Luo Luo Zheng. Apparently, they were all worried about him as well.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, all the disciples gathered around Luo Luo Zheng and began chattering.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the disciples of Cloud Sect had suffered significant losses in this trial to slay the demon.</p>

  <p>Almost every peak had reported dead or injured disciples. Blackrock Peak had suffered the most as all ten disciples had died while protecting the disciples of Lady Peak. Besides the Blackrock Peak, all the disciples from three other peaks had been killed by demon generals.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, several disciples from Skywrath Peak entered the camp.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Skytop Peak, Drizzle Peak, and Lady Peak saw the people from the Skywrath Peak and made a long face.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng left to chase the demon general, they had a conflict with the disciples of the Skywrath Peak.</p>

  <p>At that time, the disciples of Skywrath Peak thought they couldn't defeat disciples from Skytop Peak and gave up.</p>

  <p>But after they entered White Emperor City, Yale, the leader of Skywrath Peak, had become arrogant again. It was said that Yale's elder brother was in the Imperial Army and had an important post in White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>At this time, Yale saw Luo Luo Zheng, and a sly smile grew on his face. He walked up to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
