  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mike looked at his son, his love clearly evident in his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Luo Zheng only saw Mike's lips move slightly. He wasn't able to decipher what his father had said before Mike's soul slowly dissipated.</p>

  <p>The brown chaotic sea was churning slowly. From time to time, a few large ferocious beasts would poke their heads out of the water's surface to sneak a glance at Luo Luo Zheng. After they felt his Mu Ning, they immediately dove back into the depths of the sea, frightened...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still for a long time, his gaze fixed on the direction in which his father had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Twenty years had passed since he last saw his father. For Mike, twenty years was only a split-second; for Luo Luo Zheng, it was already two-thirds of his life.</p>

  <p>In that period of time, he had grown from a teenager boy to a youth. His vision and strength had also increased exponentially. He hoped his father was proud of how strong he had become.</p>

  <p>"We will meet again someday soon?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled at the place where Mike had stood earlier. He seemed to be saying this to Mike, but at the same time, it also served as an encouragement for himself.</p>

  <p>He turned and then flew towards the central continent of his inner world...</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng traveled at supersonic speed, the water in the chaotic sea below him began to swirl. A whirlpool formed first before it turned into a tornado and condensed in his hand!</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy within the entire inner world was controlled by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had the ability to change the form and shape of the chaotic energy with just a single thought...</p>

  <p>The sea water continuously morphed in Luo Zheng's hands; it quickly formed into enormous stone tablets that he held aloft in front of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extended his finger and pointed it at the tablets. He drew symbols in the air with his fingertip, and it formed inscriptions of laws. At the same time, the tablets also shimmered with a faint golden light!</p>

  <p>"Crackle..."</p>

  <p>After he finished working on the first stone tablet, countless tendrils of lightning began to revolve within it. This stone tablet recorded the power of Thunder Law that Luo Luo Zheng had already comprehended!</p>

  <p>As for the second stone tablet, its surface radiated golden rays of light.</p>

  <p>Those rays of light began to emit streams of energy. This tablet was imbued with the power of the Metal Law...</p>

  <p>A third stone tablet soon followed...</p>

  <p>One by one, Law Tablets appeared and surrounded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had entered the central continent, he tossed a Law Tablet gently from beside him. It fell down onto the ground...</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Law Tablet landed hard and was partly embedded into the ground!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't pause on his way. He flew continuously over the continent, tossing stone tablets one after another down into the continent.</p>

  <p>On that day, the citizens of the central continent thought they saw the Venerable Creator descend from the sky. He bestowed them sixteen "divine tablets" to help awaken the hidden powers of the people in this world.</p>

  <p>The warriors were like a pack of hungry wolves in the desert; they gathered on top of the stone tablets, desperately absorbing the Law Power from the "divine tablets"...</p>

  <p>Before this happened, a small number of martial artists in Luo Zheng's inner world were already familiar about the concept of Law Power. But they had only learned of the Law Power through understanding the rules of the world, which had some discrepancies with the real Law Power.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the knowledge they had of the Law Power was incomplete.</p>

  <p>Now that they had the divine tablets that recorded the laws, a whole new way to explore the world had been opened for these martial artists. Some geniuses would utilize these laws to create even stronger cultivation methods; once they reached a cultivation level that allowed them to access more powerful realms, they would have the ability to comprehend higher level laws...</p>

  <p>This would form a cycle of increasing power, allowing all the living things in his inner world to increase their strength exponentially!</p>

  <p>Mike's guidance was helpful. According to his guidance, Luo Luo Zheng still had plenty of things to do in the inner world. However, after he finished distributing the stone tablets throughout the continent, he decided to let his avatar in the inner world dissipate.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes, he realized he was already back on the path of heavens. He took a glance at the Heavenly Destinies displayed on the screens; without a hint of hesitation, he resolutely walked in the direction of the exit door from the heavens!</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz?"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng pushed the door open, an illusory gate appeared on the sky directly above the Rosy Cloud World of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng stepped out of the heavens, he slowly took in his surroundings and was shocked at the great changes he saw.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng entered the heavens to follow his father, he last remembered this place as a pile of ruins. The enormous Inauguration Altar had collapsed, and the only thing that had remained whole was Xun's Pool of Faith!</p>

  <p>Only a few days had passed since he was here, but the scenery in front of him had already transformed into something amazing.</p>

  <p>The ruins were covered by huge trees, their thick and sturdy branches crisscrossed; under these branches, trees formed a palace that seemed to have grown out of that place.</p>

  <p>Ying should be credited for such a magnificent structure and landscape.</p>

  <p>Ying's Pool of Faith had already been drained by the Ancestral Dragon. But through her own efforts, she discovered some loopholes in the universe. These loopholes existed because Mike was dying; by taking advantage of these loopholes, Ying had the ability to perfectly control the Life Law.</p>

  <p>In this matter, Ying's ability was equal to that of a Supreme Lord...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng scouted around the tree palace a few times, looking for an entrance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the two huge trees in front of him started to shake, then tilted outwards to either side. The vines from the depths of the palace intertwined with each other as they wove a path that extended all the way down to reach Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>As he observed everything that went on, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and stepped on the path formed by the vines. He enjoyed the scenery while walking slowly towards the depths of the palace.</p>

  <p>After he emerged from walking through the dense bushes, Luo Luo Zheng caught sight of a huge tree arch. Countless branches were arranged horizontally and vertically formed an exquisite building.</p>

  <p>While he was still examining the place, a tall figure approached quietly from behind. The figure was extremely agile; it did not make any kind of sound as it traveled among the trees. It also concealed its own Mu Ning perfectly to blend in with its surrounding environment.</p>

  <p>However, at the instant that this figure reached Luo Luo Zheng, he turned around and pulled the figure into his embrace, his lips instinctively pressing themselves on the figure's lips.</p>

  <p>As far as the will of worlds could reach, there was no concealment technique that could fool Luo Luo Zheng; concealing one's Mu Ning was simply useless in front of Luo Luo Zheng. He had long since discovered that it was Xun who had stalked him quietly.</p>

  <p>Xun's personality was not as cheerful as that of Mu Ning, nor as gentle as that of Ning Yudie. A bit of shyness could be barely detected behind her decisive killing nature. When she was pulled into Luo Zheng's embrace, her body immediately stiffened as if she had been struck by lightning!</p>

  <p>However, Demon Night's customs were more liberated than that of humans. Although Xun was nervous, she did not run away as a human girl would have done in the same situation. Angrily, she suddenly twisted her waist and the two of them fell downwards through the intertwined branches.</p>

  <p>As the two of them fell down, countless soft branches extended from the ground and formed a net in the air. The net caught both of them in midair and then completely wrapped them up?</p>

  <p>At the other end of the colossal tree palace, Ying sat on a tree trunk at the summit. Her elegant legs gently swung back and forth under her jade-green dress, a stream of Life Law continuously fluctuated in her hands. She curled her lips helplessly. "How could they do that in such broad daylight?"</p>

  <p>Ying built this palace using the Life Law. Naturally, she could feel every small movement within this palace. She also personally controlled the moving vines and branches.</p>

  <p>"Roar?"</p>

  <p>A gargantuan creature suddenly reared its head and sped straight in her direction. However, just as the tip of the creature's nose was only a foot away from Ying, it steadily came to a halt!</p>

  <p>"Roar... Roar... Roar..."</p>

  <p>This colossal creature was actually the Ancestral Dragon. At this moment, it was roaring at Ying, seemingly complaining.</p>

  <p>"Alright, alright, I understand?"</p>

  <p>Ying waved her hand at the direction of the Ancestral Dragon. She touched her slender fingers on the tree trunk and countless strange flowers and fruits materialized from the side of the huge tree. They emitted a sweet, rich smell.</p>

  <p>After she mastered the perfect Life Law, Ying had the ability to create things. This ability did not only enable her to create things that she had seen before, she was also able to create things that existed in her imagination.</p>

  <p>As she imagined them, these strange flowers and fruits were the perfect food. The food was used to feed this gluttonous Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>"Aren't the Genuine Dragon race exceptionally intelligent? It's been so long, but it hasn't even learned human language yet. What a stupid and gluttonous dragon!" Ying said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was opening its mouth wide to swallow the sweet fruits. Hearing these words, it seemed to be strongly dissatisfied. Its mouth began to produce strange sounds, as if it was protesting against Ying's comment?</p>
