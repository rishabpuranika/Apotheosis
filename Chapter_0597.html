<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 597 The Unboxing Of Surprises (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tia and Luo Zheng had reached a consensus that both of them would get an equal share of everything they would get.</p>

  <p>When they decided to open each box, they went for the red treasure boxes first. Each red treasure box contained a black item, the soul essence refined from the essence of the Dark Devil Phantom. It could either be traded at a decent price or used to toughen up a soul without any side effects. Luo Zheng got seven of those red treasure boxes.</p>

  <p>After putting away their share of red treasure boxes, they opened the blue treasure boxes next. Unlike the red treasure boxes, the blue ones contained more precious treasures, the blood vigor of nine-headed dragons. Out of the six blue treasure boxes, Luo Zheng got three.</p>

  <p>Looking at his stack of red and blue treasure boxes, Luo Zheng was filled with excitement. He couldn't wait to see what the other boxes held and how many he could get. He then stared at Tia without saying a word.</p>

  <p>"What are you staring at?"</p>

  <p>Tia questioned angrily. She was ill-tempered and sitting beside the half-naked Luo Zheng who kept on staring at her was a bit overwhelming. But she had to remain focused. Although she had promised to equally share the treasures with him, it was just normal for her to feel great regret. If it was any other disciple, Luo Zheng wouldn't get half of everything. Fortunately, Tia was more open-minded in practicing martial arts. She could look beyond these treasures for the greater good of the Cloud Hall. Besides, for Tia, Luo Zheng would be the most priceless treasure that the Cloud Hall could have.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng said while his eyes were still fixed on Tia, "With all these treasures, I'm afraid my space ring would run out of space." He waved his hand helplessly at Tia.</p>

  <p>The space ring that Luo Zheng was using was still the original one. Although Evil Lan's space ring didn't have a high capacity, its space had been enough for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But with all the treasures he had now, it would be hard for him to keep them all in his space ring.</p>

  <p>Thwip!</p>

  <p>A streak of silver light flickered in front of Luo Zheng. It was from the space ring that Tia tossed at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng caught it and looked at it for some while. He was stunned when he realized the high capacity of Tia's space ring. As Luo Zheng assessed, the space in that space ring might be enough to hold half of an island.</p>

  <p>The space ring was quite valuable, and it was specially designed for women. Luo Zheng noted that the outer surface of this space ring was designed with a little life-like phoenix made of heptyl gold.</p>

  <p>"Thank you! I'll put up with this space ring for the time being," Luo Zheng said smilingly as he admired the space ring that Tia lent to him. He started to put his share into the space ring.</p>

  <p>After Tia tossed the space ring to Luo Zheng, her face looked colder. Zheng's remarks appeared to be ungrateful for Tia. She hissed to herself, 'This dumbass is really ungrateful! The more he gets, the more he wants!'</p>

  <p>She shrugged off her annoyance and proceeded with the task at hand.</p>

  <p>After equally allocating the red and blue treasure boxes, Tia moved on to the three silver treasure boxes that she had obtained. She could feel her hands were getting cold. These silver boxes might contain more valuable treasures. She carefully opened each silver box, holding her breath for the wonder awaiting them.</p>

  <p>As expected, the silver treasure boxes indeed contained far more valuable items. Inside each box was a soul jade slip with a record of the Blood Fiend Emperor's previous cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had got the Blood Fiend Emperor's unique skill known as Malicious Wheel of Life and Death. Now, he didn't desire to know more about the cultivation methods recorded on the remained three soul jade slips. After all, Luo Zheng knew that it would be difficult for him to assimilate if he learned too many cultivation methods at the same time.</p>

  <p>Hence, Luo Zheng gave the three soul jade slips to Tia, and this gesture satisfied her a lot.</p>

  <p>However, Tia wouldn't practice the cultivation methods on the Blood Fiend Emperor's three secret books either. Though it was no use to her, she was sure that the elders of the Cloud Hall would make every effort to get these secret books if they were used as rewards and prizes.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall had five grade two sects affiliated to it. Thus, it was arduous and difficult to manage all these sects well. If the Cloud Hall could offer such precious rewards, each sect would try to be the best, making the work easier for Cloud Hall. Therefore, pays and rewards should be given to the top elders, stewards, and disciples.</p>

  <p>After Tia put all the silver treasure boxes into her space ring, she moved on to the gold treasure boxes with greater anticipation.</p>

  <p>As Tia opened one of the gold treasure boxes, she saw a defective stone carving.</p>

  <p>She didn't bother with it first, but as she looked closely, her eyes suddenly gleamed.</p>

  <p>Like Tia, Luo Zheng was also completely attracted to the golden stone carving even though it was very small. The feelings that overwhelmed him at that moment were somewhat like the feelings that he had when he saw the Sun Moon Stars Picture for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Hey, smart guy! So, you figured this out again?" Tia asked sarcastically as she gave Luo Zheng a hard look. This time, she really didn't believe that Luo Zheng could easily see what the stone carving revealed especially that it was his first time seeing it.</p>

  <p>The gold stone carving contained space laws. A wise disciple would be able to see through and comprehend some space laws when he mediated beside the stone carving in the Sumeru Space of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Tia was able to understand the space laws immediately upon seeing the little stone carving. The stone carving inside the Cloud Hall was defective as well. However, it was cyan blue, and its space laws were nothing compared to the golden stone carving in front of her.</p>

  <p>In general, only those people who understood some space laws could sense and experience how powerful and awesome the space laws of this stone carving were.</p>

  <p>A mediocre disciple would mistake such a stone carving as an ordinary stone especially if it was the first time that he encountered it. He would even discard it immediately after he picked the stone carving up.</p>

  <p>But Tia saw how differently Luo Zheng was gazing at the stone carving. He looked at it as if he knew what this kind of stone was and seemed to be contemplating this stone carving very attentively. However, Tia had enough of Zheng's showy attitude that she sneered at his feigned observation of the stone carving and didn't believe that he could actually comprehend space laws.</p>

  <p>In view of the current level that Luo Zheng had reached, Tia thought it was rather incredible that he cultivated the consummate sword intent and could turn his sword spirit into human shape. Apart from this, Tia had also felt that Zheng's soul was far more powerful than those of others who were at the same level as him. But even so, there was no way for Luo Zheng to truly see through the space laws that easily.</p>

  <p>At first, Tia looked at Luo Zheng with a disdainful look. But her ridicule was replaced by great astonishment when she realized what was actually happening. For her, it was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>After stepping onto the "Death Road", Luo Zheng had never shown his power of space. He had only used that power once when he tried to get the silver treasure box. It was only Fernandez and several sect heads who had witnessed Zheng's application of the power through the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>However, Tia didn't know that until now.</p>
