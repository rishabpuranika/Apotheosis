</p>

  <p>There was a feeling of fullness engulfed him making him feel more animated. Briefly, he closed his eyes, savoring the entirety of the moment when he suddenly felt the surge of life vitality tightening in his belly. Unknown to the experience, panic coursed through him. Then it began spinning and spreading out wildly?extremely out of his control!</p>

  <p>"This is... Wow!" The sense of trepidation quickly dissipated on Luo Zheng's face when it dawned on him what was going on. Realizing he finally broke through to the fifth grade of nature level, his face beamed with happiness.</p>

  <p>'Is it because of the yellow spots?' he wondered in awe while still relishing on the tingling sensation around his body.</p>

  <p>"Hey! You get it, boy." The cyan dragon's voice rang in his mind at the inopportune moment, knocking him out of his serious musing. "It's the Lucky Light of our Genuine Dragons. Let me tell you, it is very crucial in reinforcing your strength. It works wonders for martial artists with low cultivation levels," he explained to Luo Luo Zheng, rolling his eyes loftily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was fully aware of what he must concentrate on at present, and that was to promote his cultivation. Based on his assessment of himself, he was moving at a snail's pace. He believed that his progress was too slow!</p>

  <p>However, the reality was exactly the opposite of how he viewed his current capabilities. By all accounts, he was now improving at a decent rate in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Thinking that he still heard nothing of Yan, his dear sister, at this time, the intensity of his determination to get better doubled. He needed to focus and to hurry! How could he not? He was about to face the Evil East Lord whose strength was mysteriously unfathomable to him. So putting first thing first, he braced himself to his most urgent task, which was to upgrade his cultivation and strength. Although he acquired a lot on Cloud Road, his cultivation did not improve much there!</p>

  <p>"How amazing is the Lucky Light! When the guy in the later stage of Internal Elixir Realm comes in, does it mean he is going to break through the Internal Elixir Realm?" probed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"In dreams!" the cyan dragon snorted coldly. "The Lucky Light only works for refiners with cultivation below the Internal Elixir Realm, but has no effect on refiners in the Internal Elixir Realm! Bear in mind that the main reason is the Dragon Soar Arena. It has just shown up after waiting for thousands of years to produce a large amount of the Lucky Light. Now that you've absorbed most of it, those who will come next will only receive a small amount!"</p>

  <p>Each time the Dragon Soar Arena was used, it would take some time to accumulate and generate new Lucky Light. This time almost all the Lucky Light was in Luo Zheng's hands. Even if the later martial artists passed through the second floor, he might only get a little of the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who was the first to arrive, was lucky enough to receive most of the Lucky Light at once.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Luo Luo Zheng had a fascinating stroke of luck this time.</p>

  <p>This was why the cyan dragon insisted that he should not run away.</p>

  <p>"I see!" Luo Luo Zheng stated as his face exuded inexplicable radiance. If he would gather all his attributes and climb all the way to the top of the Dragon Soar Arena, then he could possibly break into the Illuminating Soul Realm in no time! In that case, the speed of his improvement would be totally unheard of in the world. It would be really incredible!</p>

  <p>As the life vitality in Luo Zheng's belly stopped spinning, the surroundings of the divine texture array slowly dissipated. So he passed through the second floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued and strode over to the stairs leading to the third floor. He had just reached the stair when he heard the sound of the door opening and closing from below!</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! Somebody's coming in!" Luo Zheng's face darkened all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>He guessed that the young master entered the Dragon Soar Arena after he had fed the winged dragon.</p>

  <p>"Take your time. Just climb at your own speed," said the cyan dragon in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng trotted up the stair and responded, "But I don't climb as fast as he does."</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng five minutes to slaughter the polar beasts, but it would only take a few dozen seconds for a refiner in the Internal Elixir Realm to eradicate them. Then he would quickly catch up with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! The divine texture array of the Dragon Soar Arena is developed based on the strength of the man climbing the Dragon Soar Arena. If he is in the later stage of Internal Elixir Realm, the beasts he will encounter should be several times fiercer than you have encountered. So don't worry, he won't get to be faster than you!" The cyan dragon chortled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was reassured to learn how the array worked, but a new doubt flitted across his mind. "Since the Lucky Light in the Dragon Soar Arena cannot promote his practice, why would he climb it?"</p>

  <p>"You'll know when you get to the top of the Dragon Soar Arena!" Instead of explicitly answering the young man's question, the cyan dragon kept him in suspense.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the third floor, the surroundings suddenly became hazy abruptly obscuring his vision. After the scene whirled in a seemingly endless circle, he found himself in a thick forest. Sharping his senses, he initially took a tentative step forward while letting his eyes scan the area closely. The place sent chills along his spine as he delved deeper. There, in the middle of the forest, a bunch of golden pythons were coiled up in trees. Noticing his presence, they glided down hissing venomously at him!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gave a smile and swung his Blood Drinking Sword toward those pythons. To him, these golden pythons were points of Lucky Light and traces of malicious Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>When he was fighting with these golden pythons, there was an accident occurring outside the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>After having been fed, the winged dragon was lazily entrenched in the top of the tower and coldly stared at the three refiners in the Internal Elixir Realm, not far away. The three refiners were waiting outside patiently after sending their young master into the tower. However, they got a little nervous facing the ferocious winged dragon, so the three of them distanced themselves.</p>

  <p>At this time, the bright Milky Way suddenly appeared above them, and almost lit up half the sky. The three refiners in the Internal Elixir Realm looked up and saw a few horses running in the air and pulling a carriage towards them!</p>

  <p>The carriage left a myriad of glistening lights in the passing sky, as if it were driving on the Milky Way.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the carriage flying in the air, the three refiners went pale.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed one of the refiners. "Someone else also found about the Dragon Soar Arena!"</p>

  <p>"The carriage... It's Lady Poison-blood of the Bloodwood Cliff! What should we do? Lady Poison-blood is coming!"</p>

  <p>"What can we do? We can do nothing about an old freak in the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Fortunately, young master has gone in, or he may not be able to get any benefit from the Dragon Soar Arena!"</p>

  <p>In a few moments, the carriage had reached the top of the stream and stopped in mid-air. Then a woman of graceful bearing stepped out of the carriage. She looked exceedingly charming, and there was a coquettish look about her, making her look like a ripe apple.</p>

  <p>This woman was Lady Poison-blood from the Bloodwood Cliff, an existence beyond refiners in the Internal Elixir Realm, and one of the best in the Central Region!</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood cast a casual glance at the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," she chuckled in a soft voice. "I thought the unusual sight in the Western Region couldn't be just because of the purple thunder bamboo. Looks like it's right for me to come here myself. The Dragon Soar Arena has shown up!"</p>

  <p>After soliloquizing, Lady Poison-blood turned her eyes to the three refiners in the Internal Elixir Realm. Then she crooked her finger towards the three and said, "You three, come here."</p>

  <p>On hearing her words, the three refiners immediately felt profoundly scared. Although they were very reluctant to approach Lady Poison-blood, they did not dare to resist her order. After all, the beautiful Lady Poison-blood was actually a cold-blooded, ruthless woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you from the Xue family?" asked Lady Poison-blood softly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lady!" replied one of the refiners. The Xue family was a force of grade three. Although grade three was next to grade four, there was a striking difference between the forces of the two grades!</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood nodded, and said with a smile, "It seems that the young master of your family has gone in. Am I right? I've long heard that the Xue family inherited the blood of the dragon. It turns out, the rumor is true!"</p>

  <p>"Our young master is indeed in the Dragon Soar Arena," said another refiner. "Only our young master's dragon-shaped jade pendant can open the Dragon Soar Arena, so the Dragon Soar Arena belongs to our Xue..."</p>

  <p>Before the refiner could finish his sentence, Lady Poison-blood stretched out her hand, and with a gentle flip, a dragon-shaped jade pendant was in her hand. "Do you mean this kind of dragon-shaped jade pendant? I also have one!" stated Lady Poison-blood. "Looks like the Dragon Soar Arena should belong to my Bloodwood Cliff!"</p>

  <p>Then Lady Poison-blood took a faint look at the winged dragon.</p>

  <p>Although it was a bit troublesome to deal with the dragon, it was not difficult for her to get rid of it.</p>

  <p>"Lady Poison-blood..." The refiner, in the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, reluctantly called her name. But as Lady Poison-blood only gave him a slight glance, he immediately shut up. In the world of martial arts, only a man of great strength could reason; people without strength were worthless!</p>

  <p>The Dragon Soar Arena was a very useful treasure for both sects and families. It was because the Lucky Light was generated in the tower every once in a while, and was very helpful for their disciples' practicing! Although Luo Luo Zheng came first and took away most of the Lucky Light this time, it would be produced again after a certain period of time.</p>

  <p>The winged dragon was prostrate on the Dragon Soar Arena, its eyes fixed on Lady Poison-blood. This was the first time it had felt threatened since it appeared with the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>However, while Lady Poison-blood was thinking about how to obtain the Dragon Soar Arena, croaks of crows rose suddenly from the air. There was a flock of crows, blotting out the sky and flying towards the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>At the sight of those crows, Lady Poison-blood's face crumpled. "It's Raven! That old man always fights with me for treasures and makes trouble for me!" she complained in a bleak voice.</p>
