<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Dark Underground Palace wasn't considered a secret place in the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Many creatures in the Dark World were also well aware that there was an underground palace here. However, in the last hundred thousand years, no one had been able to enter its mysterious depths.</p>

  <p>Legend had it that a Supreme Lord in remote ages had once passed away in this place hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>

  <p>Time was the most powerful opponent of all warriors. Even a Supreme Lord's lifespan was not without its limits. If a Supreme Lord was unable to become a True God, he or she would eventually encounter the Five Aging Processes and die. Immortality could not be achieved easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the eternal life was also one of warriors' ultimate goals.</p>

  <p>It was said that before this Supreme Lord from remote ages had passed away, he had used extremely special methods to set up an incomparably grand underground palace, and that he had left behind all of his knowledge and inheritances within it. It was rumored to be a treasure trove for any martial artist.</p>

  <p>Each time the Dark Underground Palace was opened, the time and method required to open it were different.</p>

  <p>In the endless years since it had first been established, there had been many warriors who had entered the underground palace and obtained great benefits from it. However, entering the underground palace was not something that any warrior could hope to accomplish.</p>

  <p>Xun had once entered the Dark Underground Palace. This was already ten thousand years ago when the underground palace had opened.</p>

  <p>When Xun had once been in the underground palace, she had also obtained a wealth of resources and benefits. Therefore, when she had heard that Lincoln had also found a way to enter the Dark Underground Palace, she immediately made Luo Zheng agree to accompany him. If she remembered correctly, the resources left behind in the underground palace would be of great help to Luo Zheng in his endeavors.</p>

  <p>Following Lincoln's lead, they traversed through more than half of Auspice City and quickly found the entrance to the Dark Underground Palace.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the underground palace was not hard to find. It was not hidden. However, after the last ten years of evolution, the entrance to the underground palace had actually become a place frequented by commoners. Of course, no commoner would dare to stop warriors as they passed through. They didn't meet any troubles before they stood in front of the Dark Underground Palace.</p>

  <p>"This is the entrance to the underground palace," Lincoln told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Adrian chuckled from behind them. "Everyone knows that this is the entrance to the underground palace. It's hardly a secret. It's just that no one knows how to explore it and find the treasures. We'll have to trouble you to lead the way, Lincoln, since you have found a way!"</p>

  <p>As for the seven brothers who followed behind Adrian, their expressions were indifferent. Despite Adrian's constant reminders to be watchful of their manners, they could not hide the raw greed on their faces. They were little more than treasure hunters, and brought no respect to the time honored traditions of the warriors.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, as long as Lincoln could successfully lead them to find the treasures, everyone else could then be killed, other than themselves, of course. As for Adrian, he was still quite useful to them, so they could temporarily spare his life. To these men, life held little value.</p>

  <p>"Follow me." A confident expression settled on Lincoln's face as he took the lead and entered the passage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Freya, and the other warriors, who followed behind him, also entered the dark and forbidding passage.</p>

  <p>This passage was incredibly long and sloped slightly downwards. Adrian and the seven brothers had collected a vast amount of information before they had come here, so they had formed a good understanding of the underground palace. They had already known that the passage into the underground palace was quite complicated, and its length would be astonishing to behold. But it was not until now that they began to realize how long it truly was.</p>

  <p>This passage extended downwards and continued for an unknown distance. Without hesitation, they soon stepped into the passage.</p>

  <p>At the start, everyone had proceeded forward on foot, but very quickly, they discovered that the passage was so long that they could not see the end of it, nor could they reach it easily. Everyone then started to fly to speed up their journey.</p>

  <p>At the same time, something was happening in the western part of the Dark World. There was a sacred place named Magnolia Sacred Place there.</p>

  <p>There were many races found in the entire Dark World. However, because this supreme world was situated at the junction of three great races, the three strongest races in this world were still the ogres, the human race, and the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>These three races had all established their own tenth-grade sacred places in the Dark World, but because of the geopolitical formalities, which they all observed, these three sacred places interacted extremely well with each other. There wasn't much competition among them, and they maintained trade relations with each other. So it could be said that these three sacred places were the windows through which the three races interacted with each other. However, in other supreme worlds, the three races still fought against each other and all kinds of conflicts never ended.</p>

  <p>The Magnolia Sacred Place was a tenth-grade sacred place established by the human race.</p>

  <p>In the center of this sacred place, there stood a towering palace that pierced the clouds. Two black-clothed warriors were rapidly entering the palace now.</p>

  <p>"Saint Lord, a few warriors have entered the underground palace again today," said one of the two black-robed warriors in a respectful tone.</p>

  <p>Their leader, who sat enthroned in the palace, asked with an indifferent face, "Who are they? What is their race? Do you know their cultivation levels?"</p>

  <p>"They are human warriors. There are only eleven of them in total. Seven people are at the Spirit Supreme Realm. The other four are all at the Soul Sea Realm," the black-robed warrior again answered very respectfully.</p>
