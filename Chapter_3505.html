<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3505 The Change In The Vortex </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thirty-three stages on the Other Shore were distributed such that there were thirteen stages in the Lust World and nineteen stages in the Desire World.</p>

  <p>The Desire World gathered together the backbone power of the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Most people who could enter this world were at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>But they could enter Stage Fourteen even if they hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm. Only precursor was that their Souls of Light had turned into Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>But from Stage Fourteen onward, the Other Shore Power of the Other Shore Tokens measured at least one thousand Jun. Creatures that hadn't merged with the Chaotic Source Spirits wouldn't be able to unleash their full power.</p>

  <p>One solution to this problem would be to fuse with an Other Shore Token of the descending type.</p>

  <p>But there was a huge gap between the physical strength of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors and that of those who were not at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Beneath the energy vortex was a stone platform similar to the one located at Stage Thirteen in the Lust World. A few Souls of Light waited on this platform.</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light belonged to the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Most of them were from the group that had ascended before Luo Zheng. But there were several Souls of Light that were imposing and serious. These belonged to the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng circled in the air alongside Dorothy, he felt an invisible pressure bearing down on them from the curtain of purple light floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>But because Luo Zheng's and Dorothy's Souls of Light had long since become Indigo Souls, they could bear the pressure.</p>

  <p>He held Dorothy in his arms as he descended slowly. He stepped carefully onto the stone platform before gently putting her down.</p>

  <p>Dorothy blushed scarlet under the gaze of the crowd and retreated quickly to the side. Lucky for her, everyone was on the Other Shore and couldn't see her flaming face. But the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had seen what had happened and were stunned.</p>

  <p>Passing through the energy vortex was dangerous. What the hell was this couple doing?</p>

  <p>A Soul of Light with a strong aura walked towards them and said, "Please tell us your names and show us your soul marks."</p>

  <p>These senior disciples didn't know what was going on in the Lust World and were using the soul marks to verify their identities.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, from the Origin Mountain," Dorothy said, keeping her voice low as she showed him her soul mark.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, from the Flow Sword Sect," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief looked at him in unison when they heard his name. Many of them looked amused.</p>

  <p>Before Dorothy had entered the Land of Sword Grief, they had already heard about her. After all, she was the apple of Ying's eye, and she and Feng Ge were considered to be the top two women warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had become famous because of the battle he had fought after he had entered the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p id="top_10">His ranking on the Ranking Stone had surpassed that of the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>"Gee, Madam Ying's granddaughter and Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"They make a perfect match. This boy was not born in a great clan but he has incredible talent and will make many, many achievements in the future."</p>

  <p>"Archibald will be shocked to see this! I'll tell him after I get out of the Other Shore. I wonder how he will react outwardly, though!"</p>

  <p>They communicated with each other through their life vitality.</p>

  <p>There were only a few female members in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's and Feng Ge's beauty attracted the attention of many senior disciples after they entered the Land of Sword Grief. Some admired them secretly, and some tried to ingratiate themselves with them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked aloof, causing these warriors to feel so intimidated that they didn't dare try to get close to her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy dealt with them cleverly. She received more attention than Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Many people became jealous as they watched Luo Zheng hold Dorothy on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and Dorothy verified their identities by showing their soul marks and speaking their names, they silently stepped aside. Moments later, Luo Zheng said, "I'll leave the Other Shore now. You stay here and wait for me to come back."</p>

  <p>His physical body was still in the Lust World. It was now his physical body's turn to come here.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Be careful!" Dorothy whispered shyly.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light had disappeared from the stone platform.</p>

  <p>The others were waiting. When they found that Luo Zheng had dissipated his Soul of Light, they were confused, but didn't think much of it.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Luo Zheng's physical body had reappeared on the stone platform of Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Chaim was pleased to see Luo Zheng return. It looked like Luo Zheng's and Dorothy's Souls of Light had safely reached their destination.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't tell Chaim anything about his other name, 'Tianxing'. Chaim wouldn't reveal his secret or ask Luo Zheng about that.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge asked Luo Zheng worriedly, "Do you think my physical body will pass through that?"</p>

  <p>"You can't stay in Stage Thirteen just for this physical body," Luo Zheng tried to comfort her. "Don't worry. The worst that could happen is that you'll have to abandon the purified being's body. Your Soul of Light will always be powerful."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Luo Zheng, you have to protect me!" Feng Ge said, a lovely but rare smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was not an easy-going person. Luo Zheng had actually liked the version of Feng Ge who had lost her memory.</p>

  <p>But now, she was behaving like she used to be when she had lost her memory in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>At her expression, Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. But he was still confused.</p>

  <p>Both Dorothy and Feng Ge were behaving unusually today.</p>

  <p>After many disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, including Sally, had ascended to the next stage, only Luo Zheng, Chaim, and Feng Ge were left on the stone platform.</p>

  <p>"I'll go first, guys," Chaim said. He then pulled out the Cloud Flying Wheel and flew towards the energy vortex in the distance.</p>

  <p>After Chaim had disappeared in the vortex, Luo Zheng said, "It's our turn. I'll lead the way since I have just passed through this vortex. You can follow me."</p>

  <p>He then activated the Cloud Flying Wheel once again and shot off into the distance, Feng Ge following close behind.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two of them rose high into the air and flew towards the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>The energy bands didn't react when Luo Zheng first approached the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>But when Feng Ge approached it, the bands seemed to instantly become frenzied and restless.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge frowned as she manipulated the Cloud Flying Wheel to pause in mid-air.</p>

  <p>The energy bands were restless, but they didn't roll upwards. Luo Zheng observed them for a few seconds before saying, "It's alright! Let's speed up!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pursed her lips at this.</p>

  <p>She told herself that she should believe Luo Zheng, and she let the doubt go.</p>

  <p>They waited for a while outside and then suddenly sped up, rushing into the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>But the moment they entered it, a weird change took place in the energy vortex. The energy bands in the outer layer rolled back in unison, tightly sealing their way to retreat.</p>
