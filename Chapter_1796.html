<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon, like a great river stretching for thousands of miles, twisted its body in circles in the vastness. Hot smoke spilled from its enormous nostrils, clearly angered. The atmosphere was tense, on edge.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew this was a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The creature's body could be compared to that of a genuine dragon, for in many ways, they were very similar. The two kinds of dragons could be distinguished by their heads though, which were completely different.</p>

  <p>That of the Torch Dragon was like a bird's beak: long and pointy with a curved shape. Sharp, too. Two gill-like flaps of very thin skin grew on both sides of its neck, giving it the menacing look you'd expect from a cobra.</p>

  <p>Staring at a flame ablaze on its head, the Torch Dragon continued its process of capturing Supreme Lord Mirage by circling him dizzyingly.</p>

  <p>Moving at a quick pace, the Supreme Lord and the Torch Dragon headed toward depths of the back side of the world. No one could really see what was happening when the two were moving so fast.</p>

  <p>The back side of its unimaginably huge body continuously appeared before the bystanders' eyes as they watched at a far distance. The patterns on its scales were extremely exquisite and special, tinkling when they crossed paths with the flame from above, but no one was in the mood to appreciate such beauty.</p>

  <p>If one was to consider the Torch Dragon to be a powerhouse just like a Supreme Lord, then this could be regarded as a confrontation between two Supreme Lords. Not a single word was spoken aloud, and yet the entire crowd clearly understood that if the dragon were to change directions and wrap them tightly with its body, they would all die a painful death of suffocation.</p>

  <p>Closer to the action between Supreme Lord Mirage and the dragon, both Luo Zheng and Tianming had the urgent desire to leave the back side of the world.</p>

  <p>The battle here wasn't something they could allow themselves to get involved in. They were strong, that was undeniable, but not strong enough to face something so great!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords' strength was more apparent to Nathan, Lucille and the others as ever. With their current cultivation, if they were involved in the battle, they would be turned into ashes in a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>Too late. A few glances at each other were enough for their hearts to begin pounding in terror: a wisp of black smoke had appeared on each of their chests. In a moment of absolute despair, they realized that the Smoky Heart-locking Curse had tied the grand sorcerer and all eight of them together.</p>

  <p>"Kill the grand sorcerer first, and then leave this place!"</p>

  <p>Nathan demanded through gritted teeth. Every single muscle in his body was now tense, his eyes red and bulging. He was making a forceful effort, to say the least, and every swollen vein in his arms could be counted off one by one.</p>

  <p>The long spear in his hand began spinning, slowly at first and then picking up speed, like a wheel. Nathan stared straight at the grand sorcerer in front of him, spatters of blood appearing in the white of his eyes. Without a blink, he held his gaze and one after the other, the blood vessels in his eyes began to burst. Blood was suddenly flowing from his eyes, creating skinny red rivers down the length of his cheeks and dripping off his jawline. He looked like hell and the devil, truly terrifying.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the Otherworldly Swordsman's broken sword suddenly rose into the air at the same time. Its consciousness seemed to have been pushed to its limit. A series of circular sword patterns spread out, trapping the grand sorcerer within them.</p>

  <p>"Purple River Sword Array!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The battle had begun without warning. The remainder of the crowd backed up even further. Desperate times required desperate measures and Mu Ning hadn't hesitated in setting up her own sword array.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Tianming and Kurt equally played their ace cards, one after another. Swords clanged, sparks flew and spell chants could be heard from all three of them. Bursts of light and smoke came from their weapons and attacked the grand sorcerer with everything they had.</p>

  <p>They all shared one and only thought: to kill the grand sorcerer in the shortest amount of time and then flee! As their minds focused and conjoined on this thought, they thrashed their weapons with confidence.</p>

  <p>As everyone began attacking with the precision of skills and the will to live, the grand sorcerer began to take action, now fighting for himself.</p>

  <p>The thorns covering the greater part of his body stood up fiercely, and his originally twisted body began to take an even stranger shape. From behind him, a scorpion's shadow appeared.</p>

  <p>"Holy Poison Body!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Poison Body was one of the unique skills only possessed by the elders of the sorcerer race. If they decided to transform their blood into the most deadly poisons, they had to give up their lives. The Holy Poison Body was of strong toxicity. After it was activated, they would die from the poison. There was no cure.</p>

  <p>There were many cultivation techniques in the sorcerer race that had powerful side effects. This technique held the ultimate consequence though: death. Sure, they could defeat their enemies by using the Holy Poison Body, but they'd be paying through the nose for doing so. Thus, such a technique was only used on the rarest occasions. This battle was of utmost importance.</p>

  <p>It would only take two hours following the activation of the Holy Poison Body that the grand sorcerer would resemble the reincarnation of a Poison God. His body, power and perception would all be strengthened quickly and greatly. Two hours later, however, he himself would die from the poison.</p>

  <p>Deep in his heart, the grand sorcerer didn't want to use the Holy Poison Body, but killing the eight Godly Geniuses was now the only thing on his mind, the message pumping from his heart, to his brain, and travelling throughout his entire body, all the way down to his fingertips. For the sake of his race, he would rather give up his own life.</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>The poisonous, dark green smoke began rising into the air. The grand sorcerer didn't budge in the least. No one even noticed a flinch. Instead, he rushed toward his opponents, letting the young warriors launch their deadly attacks on him in consecutive lances.</p>

  <p>He kept his focus. He knew the only thing he truly had to avoid at all costs was Nathan's spear.</p>

  <p>Nathan's spear skills were too terrific and too terrifying. Every thrust was a fatal threat. Even though the grand sorcerer's strength had been greatly improved by the Holy Poison Body, he still couldn't forcefully take Nathan's spear strikes. He dodged his opponent's all attacks while keeping as far as possible from Nathan's deadly spear.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the mist began to spin and pick up speed, somewhat like a tornado except the fact that the grand sorcerer was standing right in the middle of it. In less than a few seconds, he was completely wrapped from head to toe by the deadly, whirling mist. The eight Godly Geniuses began to retreat in turn, their faces brimming with worry, sweat streaking down their dirty faces.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon's huge body with single scale the size of a human head would occasionally pass by them. As long as they were caught inside its body, there would be no reason for them to live anyway. They had been dragged to the brink of death and if they wasted just a few more seconds, they would probably go straight over the edge.</p>
