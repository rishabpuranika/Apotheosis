<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2513 Mike's Ambition </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng's inner world had emitted a strong desire that constantly stimulated him, he had been looking forward to making a breakthrough for a long time.</p>

  <p>His elixir field emitted a gentle light and he did not resist at all. Then, all the Spiritual Darknesses were completely absorbed.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Lorena didn't consider Luo Zheng's endurance, or she didn't need to consider that at all.</p>

  <p>"May I enter your inner world and take a look?" asked Lorena. A smile spread over Luo Zheng's face as he nodded.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a figure that resembled Lorena's consciousness quickly floated into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Beside her stood his avatar and together, they landed at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Phew! Phew! Phew!"</p>

  <p>Numerous Spiritual Darknesses kept squeaking and falling from the sky.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Darknesses did not have a higher form of intelligence and were completely under Lorena's control.</p>

  <p>Although it was clear that they would be swallowed down, they still flew into Luo Zheng's inner world without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"The strength source of the Nine Divine Stars is actually quite a lot,"</p>

  <p>Lorena exclaimed as she glanced up at the sky. "If I'm not mistaken, some Holy Being helped you forge the Nine Divine Stars, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the strength source Holy Jay has given," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled. "They are a bit unusual, aren't they? They actually gave the strength source directly to you."</p>

  <p>She thought that it was simply crazy to forge Luo Zheng's inner world into what it was now.</p>

  <p>She paused and gazed into the distance, only to see dozens of rays of light in the air.</p>

  <p>"Is that the internal momentum of the Divine Dao?" Lorena's eyes narrowed. She wasted no time and immediately flew towards the rays of light.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he didn't say anything and simply followed his mother from behind.</p>

  <p>When Lorena arrived above the Godly Tile that Luo Zheng had condensed, she saw that it emitted more than 300 rays of light.</p>

  <p>Those rays of light contained the internal momentum of different Divine Dao, which were distributed throughout Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"So many Divine Dao!" Lorena cried out in surprise. "There are at least three hundred Divine Dao! How? How is that possible? I don't understand!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng thought that his mother, an extraordinary creature, must've known more things than him.</p>

  <p>Yet, why was she so surprised at what she saw?</p>

  <p>"Mother, what's wrong?" he asked curiously. His mother was still transfixed at his Godly Tile with a confused look on her face.</p>

  <p>"How could you absorb so many Divine Dao? It's... It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>It was known that Chiyou had created the three thousand Divine Dao in the divine land.</p>

  <p>They were made for the Nine Li people, not the True Gods or the Holy Beings in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Now, it wasn't particularly hard for ordinary True Gods to cultivate one or two kinds of Divine Dao. The extremely talented True Gods could even cultivate three or five kinds of Divine Dao or combine two or three kinds of Divine Dao into new ones, all of which belonged exclusively to themselves.</p>

  <p>Lorena had never heard of anyone who could absorb over three hundred Divine Dao like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Father gave me a ruler, which is known as the Infinity Ruler," Luo Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>"The Infinity Ruler!"</p>

  <p>Lorena couldn't help the chill that ran down her spine. She stared at her son and asked, "How could it be? How could the Infinity Ruler appear here? It can't possibly appear in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>If she was surprised before, now she was in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>"But before I came to the divine land, my father had indeed given me the Infinity Ruler," replied Luo Zheng with utmost sincerity.</p>

  <p>Lorena looked at her son's Godly Tile again and said, "I see. No wonder your father was so confident. Although he didn't know many things, he understood the simplest thing. He gave you the Infinity Ruler so that you can absorb the three thousand Divine Dao and get the Divine Dao Guide. That way, your inner world will be more like the divine land. He wants you to gain control of the divine land! This is his ambition!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, no one controlled the divine land, because the one who controlled it was Chiyou himself.</p>

  <p>Those who were in charge of the forbidden lands, whether big or small, only had a certain authority. Their abilities might be very powerful in one aspect, but they were not qualified enough to rule the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>However, anyone who could obtain the Divine Dao Guide could create a small divine land and therefore, gain control of the divine land.</p>

  <p>But there was a catch: it was not easy to practice Chiyou's three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>No matter how talented one was, it was still something that was impossible to achieve.</p>

  <p>That was why Lorena had never thought about those things.</p>

  <p>Still, it never occurred to her that Mike had gotten the Infinity Ruler!</p>

  <p>Where did he get it?</p>

  <p>"Seek control of the divine land?!" Luo Zheng was truly shocked to hear his mother's words. He had never thought that his father would have such an ambition. The problem was, even his mother didn't know about the Infinity Ruler. How did his father get it then?</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard to use the Infinity Ruler to absorb the Divine Dao. As long as Luo Zheng was given enough time, he could absorb all the three thousand Divine Dao sooner or later.</p>

  <p>As of now, he had absorbed one tenth of the Divine Dao. If a truly powerful being made him study the Divine Dao Tablets continuously, it wouldn't be long before he made it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would be more than an almighty man if he really gained full control of the divine land. Not even the Holy Beings or the Yellow Emperor Guards would be able to fight against him.</p>

  <p>"Hmmm? Mike must have some secrets that I don't know," Lorena hissed.</p>

  <p>She had told him everything she knew when they had gotten married.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect Mike to hide some things from her, so she naturally felt slightly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Maybe my father got the Infinity Ruler much later," Luo Zheng tried to reason.</p>

  <p>Lorena's lips curved up into a small smile.</p>

  <p>Although she was angry at her husband, she was happy that he and her son could do such a thing. "There will be a day when the truth comes out. Since you have expanded your inner world to such an extent, you must absorb these Spiritual Darknesses quickly!" she told her son.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, didn't absorb all the Spiritual Darknesses as his mother instructed.</p>

  <p>More than ninety percent of them fell into the chaotic sea and the waters began to surge.</p>

  <p>He let the rest of the Spiritual Darknesses fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Spiritual Darknesses dug holes and hid underground like rats.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to cultivate more Spiritual Darknesses, he just needed to feed them with divine might coins continuously. He would have more Spiritual Darknesses in his inner world as long as he could get enough divine might coins.</p>

  <p>He hoped that wouldn't be a problem since the forbidden lands in his inner world continuously produced divine might coins.</p>

  <p>He didn't know the use of the divine might coins before. Now that the Spiritual Darknesses constantly divided and reproduced, he could easily get almost an infinite number of Spiritual Darknesses.</p>

  <p>A large number of Spiritual Darknesses in the chaotic sea turned into numerous brown clouds which almost shrouded the entire sky of Luo Zheng's inner world. Soon enough, those brown clouds gathered towards Luo Zheng's Godly Tile.</p>
