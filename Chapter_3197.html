<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Don't even think of leaving!"</p>

  <p>Marco had started running after Zheng had, but he soon appeared before Zheng, sword held aloft in his hand.</p>

  <p>If Zheng tried to dodge him, he'd probably be struck down into two halves by the sword.</p>

  <p>He frowned and looked around. He bent down, bunching his body into as small a ball as possible, and managed to escape from the narrow sliver of space he had been left, just barely avoiding the sword.</p>

  <p>But Marco landed a kick to his abdomen just as he had thought he had dodged it. .</p>

  <p>Zheng let out a loud "Oof!" as he landed on the huge drum, bouncing several times and making it rumble.</p>

  <p>The members of the Xu Clan began to cheer loudly. They had no idea what had happened before, nor did they care. All they knew was that Marco represented them and their Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>In an exquisite room in the flying carriage of Xu Clan...</p>

  <p>Lazlo, Grayson, and Drystan watched the battle on the huge drums, rendered unmoving by the intensity of their interest.</p>

  <p>"Young master Marco is better than we thought."</p>

  <p>"He was never bad. He's using the Spirits Trinity, which makes him much more powerful than others from the same stage as him."</p>

  <p>"I just don't understand why he had to travel all this way to kill this guy. He could have just assigned this task to the intelligence agency. It would have been a piece of cake for us."</p>

  <p>The three of them had been concerned about Marco, but watching him fight had filled them with relief.</p>

  <p>Zheng got back to his feet, but Marco had launched another sword attack before he could steady himself. .</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his sword to defend himself but his power was absorbed by Marco's sword attack. Again.</p>

  <p>As all the strength left Zheng's arm, Marco brought his sword down on Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>But Zheng, sensing the danger, swiftly leaned backwards and avoided the power of the sword's slash. .</p>

  <p>Like before, just as Zheng dodged the sword attack, Marco forcefully elbowed him off. Zheng landed some distance away on the drum with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed quite defenseless against Marco.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the guy from the Seven Mountains Meeting?" Marco mocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng got to his feet again. He stretched out his arms, raised two fingers, and said, "200 divine megatons."</p>

  <p>"What?" Marco was confused at Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>"There's a limit to the Other Shore Power that you can absorb," Zheng said calmly. "The maximum you can absorb is a mere 200 divine megatons."</p>

  <p>Absorbing other people's power for one's own use was a powerful ability.</p>

  <p>Zheng could do the same in the divine land, and that made him almost invincible.</p>

  <p>Zheng had become very cautious after noticing Marco's abilities. If he lost all his Other Shore Power to Marco, the defeat would be his destiny.</p>

  <p>So Zheng had carefully released his power, little by little. He had lost 200 divine megatons of Other Shore Power before realizing that that was the maximum that Marco could take.</p>

  <p>A mere 200 divine megatons of Other Shore Power meant nothing to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A mere 200 divine megatons..."</p>

  <p>Marco repeated Zheng's words subconsciously and on realizing what they meant, a kind of ferocity overtook him. He raised his long sword, on which were crisscrossed red and green lights, and took off towards Zheng like a heavy gust of wind.</p>

  <p>The two lights were from the Speed Spirit and the Absorption Spirit that were working in tandem with each other.</p>

  <p>The Spirits Trinity contained 300 divine megatons of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>All three spirits could grow by themselves.</p>

  <p>When he had first obtained the Spirits Trinity, the Absorption Spirit had only been able to draw 20 divine megatons of force from the opponent. But now, the number had increased tenfold to an astonishing 200. Combined with the original 300 divine megatons of force within the Spirits Trinity, there was now a total of 500 divine megatons of force at Marco's disposal.</p>

  <p>With the speed of his attack boosted by the Speed Spirit, nobody in the same stage within the Lust World could match him.</p>

  <p>Only Milo from the Flow Sword Sect had been able to dazzle Marco with his mysterious way of attack. But he might be able to defeat him if they had a fight on the battle ring openly.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still as Marco rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's right arm was covered with the Shade Stone liquid while the Strength God Totem started to form its power. .</p>

  <p>He then slashed his Snow Sword through the air. The once dexterous sword grew heavier and heavier as the Other Shore Power amassed within it.</p>

  <p>The space around Zheng's right arm began to twist, causing the huge drum beneath his feet to rumble.</p>

  <p>The Clear Lake behind him was trembling, setting off rhythmic waves of water.</p>

  <p>"Since you're determined to die, offer your life to my sword!" Zheng was ready to strike a deadly blow at Marco, the power able enough to cut through heaven and earth. Even time seemed to freeze.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng was using the Strength God Totem against an enemy.</p>

  <p>Marco had been confident of winning, for he had the boost from the Speed Spirit and the Absorption Spirit.</p>

  <p>But he had just begun to rush towards Zheng when he felt a strong Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Impossible!</p>

  <p>Marco's eyes widened in disbelief and shock.</p>

  <p>He had drawn 200 divine megatons of Other Shore Power from Zheng. How could Zheng still have such a terrifying power remaining within him?</p>

  <p>He might have over 1, 000 divine megatons! But Zheng had never accepted the Chaotic Source Reinforcement! How was he doing that?</p>

  <p>Marco had no time to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>The master of the Xu Clan leapt to his feet, fear written all over his face.</p>

  <p>The power that Zheng had unleashed was beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>The masters of the Li Clan and the Lin Clan were shocked too. But since they weren't in anyway involved in this battle, all they had to do was sit and watch, irrespective of what happened in the battle.</p>

  <p>If Marco were to die here, how could the Xu Clan bear the anger that was sure to come their way from the Vastness Mountain?</p>

  <p>It was too late to stop Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Grayson, Lazlo, and Drystan were even more anxious than the master of the Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>They hadn't done anything so far because they had thought Marco had it under control. None of them had seen this coming.</p>

  <p>They shot out of the room like bullets, shredding the room into pieces. They were still halfway to where Zheng and Marco were fighting, when a loud bang sounded from the giant drums.</p>

  <p>Zheng bobbed in the air, the huge drum under his feet having been turned to dust.</p>

  <p>Marco crashed into the Clear Lake, causing a wave of more than a thousand feet high to rise.</p>

  <p>"Is he still alive?" Zheng's eyes narrowed since he hadn't yet seen Marco's body.</p>

  <p>His sword slash had been partly shielded by a yellow diamond-shaped light curtain derived from Marco's Latent Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Zheng was determined to kill Marco. He wasn't about to ever let him go.</p>

  <p>He shot towards the lake, moving so fast, it looked like he had just disappeared from where he had hovered over the drums. But Lazlo caught up with him.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack our young master? You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>A deadly energy rose from Lazlo's hand as he charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a powerful warrior who had surpassed the Lust World, Lazlo saw Zheng as a little boy who could be easily taken care of.</p>

  <p>However, Lazlo was silently cursing Marco. He could have sent someone for Zheng. But he had insisted on killing Zheng himself and was now in serious trouble. If anything happened to him, the three of them would be buried alongside him.</p>

  <p>Lazlo had thought dispatching Zheng was an easy task, but a sudden, inexplicable sense of fear struck him.</p>
