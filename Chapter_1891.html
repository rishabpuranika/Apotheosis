<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though her sister rebuked her, Aleyna was not the slightest bit afraid of her. She continued, "The entire universe is under the control of the Holy Being. What right do the others have to be called a controller?"</p>

  <p>After hearing Aleyna's explanation, Zheng finally understood.</p>

  <p>Since the universe was the inner world of a Holy Being, then it stood to reason that the Holy Being was the master of the universe. This logic was quite very obvious and easy to follow.</p>

  <p>But he was not certain as to what kind of role Irene played. Just like what Aleyna said, was Irene really a so-called "trustee"?</p>

  <p>"Trustee, what is that?" Zheng asked again, his brows furrowing in confusion.</p>

  <p>At his question, Aleyna blinked a few times. Her eyes were a little round and watery, and they notably lacked the charming yet lonely quality of Liusu's beautiful orbs.</p>

  <p>It was natural for a young girl at her age to have fervent adoration for the strong. Others might be curious and have questions and doubts about Zheng's origins, but his past and his strength didn't matter to her, as long as he would not do anything to provoke her.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Liusu was a bit more mature than Aleyna. She was more inclined to use Zheng for her own advantage and use him to complete her agendas, such as entering the Soul Suppressing Cliff or even attacking Quentin.</p>

  <p>But Aleyna's indifference toward Zheng might change once she became interested in him. The moment that happened, she would definitely dig up everything she could about him.</p>

  <p>"Then, tell me, who is the controller of heavens you were speaking of?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna asked, waiting for his answer.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated, unable to answer right away. In truth, he knew nothing about that person, except her name. Drawing a deep breath, he answered,</p>

  <p>"It is Irene Jiang."</p>

  <p>"Ha! It is her! The trustee that the Jiang Clan had sent!" Aleyna said, her lips curving into a wide smile.</p>

  <p>A flash of satisfaction passed over Liusu's eyes at the revelation. She was evidently pleased to know more about Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng watched their reactions and realized that they probably knew a secret he didn't know of. "What?"</p>

  <p>"That is the Evolutionary Universe," Aleyna informed.</p>

  <p>"Evolutionary Universe..." Zheng said slowly, testing the way it rolled off with his tongue. Was this the name of the universe he was in?</p>

  <p>Aleyna looked at Zheng with doubts clouding her face, and said, "But the Holy Being who built the Evolutionary Universe seemed to be caught in a bad situation. We think he's already dead."</p>

  <p>"Aleyna, what are you talking about?" Liusu said quickly, interrupting her sister. She clarified, "The Holy Being and the universe are interdependent. If the universe is still there, the Holy Being can't be dead."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Holy Being is about to die. Didn't they say that they were ready to take action? If the Evolutionary Universe is destroyed and broken up, then won't that mean that the Holy Being will die as well?" Aleyna continued.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sincerity in Aleyna's words, Zheng became certain that they weren't lying.</p>

  <p>It was indeed true that the universe was in danger and facing the invasion of the Sacred race. Furthermore, Tianming had once informed him that the master of the universe was on the verge of death. . .</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Zheng as well as his companions was born because the universe was trying to save itself in the face of the crisis. Their fate was to lead the great world of chaos. According to Tianming, their destiny had been sealed and preordained the moment they were born.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had been cultivating all this time, it was unavoidable to run into some accidents. For instance, entering the fairy palace had been an accident. He also had another accident when he obtained the "Primal Chaos Technique".</p>

  <p>However, despite these accidents, his path was still the same as before.</p>

  <p>Including the guidance of the nine Genuine Dragons and the fact that Yan was taken away, these facts had made up his resolve and helped him move forward.</p>

  <p>The ultimate and final goal was to get Zheng to go to the divine land and save everything.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was impossible for the entire universe to place its hopes on just one person, so a batch of geniuses were born to share Zheng's burden.</p>

  <p>As countless geniuses fought in the Illusion Battlefield, ten chosen people would then carry an irresistible destiny on their shoulders as they moved forward.</p>

  <p>Zheng could deduce as much based on the limited information available to him. However, he still had more questions lingering in his mind. "Is this a struggle between Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Liusu, who was standing beside him, nodded her head. "Of course, but the outcome of this battle has already been decided. Now, it can't be considered as a struggle anymore, but the end of it instead. The master of the Evolutionary Universe has lost irrevocably."</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to be in deep thought. "Since this is a battle between Holy Beings, why doesn't the winner just shatter the universe? With the strength and might of a Holy Being, it should be possible, right?" Zheng asked, becoming even more curious.</p>

  <p>Aleyna answered with a smile, "That's not possible. The divine land isn't like what you think at all. The Hall of Holy Beings will never agree to it."</p>

  <p>"Hall of Holy Beings..." Zheng trailed off, his forehead creasing in confusion. "What is that? I've never heard of that."</p>

  <p>Aleyna immediately realized the extent of Zheng's lack of knowledge when it came to the divine land. Drawing a deep breath, she decided to be patient and explain everything he needed to know.</p>

  <p>She was being so accommodating and patient because she wanted to show off in front of him. "You don't even know this... Here, let me explain in detail. The divine land, I'm afraid, is very different from what you imagined."</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen many civilizations along the way.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night had an absolute and strict divine system. The three queens ruled over everything and they were revered as the gods of the Demon Night. Because of this, they were able to use the Pools of Faith.</p>

  <p>The ordinary sacred places were run and organized by the long-established sect system, and they were formed according to strength.</p>

  <p>Whether it was a sixth-grade sacred place or a tenth grade one, the difference in their strength was significant. However, the rules and culture of these sacred places were not really different from a low-grade sect. This was the primitive and old system.</p>

  <p>Other than the sacred places, there was also the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>In divine kingdom, the imperial family was the sole ruler and all the large and small forces depended on it.</p>

  <p>With this type of civilization, only the monarch and their clan stood at the height of power. Only the outstanding disciples in their clan could inherit the best legacies and heritage.</p>

  <p>And in the vast divine land, countless years had gone by...</p>

  <p>These countless years were reminiscent of the day that the world was created and the chaos was cleaved apart by the Creating Axe.</p>

  <p>Here, time had become a foreign concept... a concept that ordinary people found difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>After all, time was one of the rules and regulations they established, and for a very long period of time, the 'time' of the entire divine land had not been created yet. That was the reason why time was still at that moment.</p>

  <p>It was also the explanation why the divine land had been living in a state of deathly stillness for a long stretch of time.</p>

  <p>By the time the concept of 'time' was created, the divine land had already gone through countless years. The scale of time was unimaginably long and had become an illusory noun.</p>

  <p>In the ancient times, countless creatures and races constantly died and gave birth to the country of mortals and by extension, their sects.</p>

  <p>As the strength of the sect warriors increased exponentially, these sects soon managed to surpass the mortal nations, gradually becoming sacred places and later on becoming divine kingdoms. It was quite similar with the universe, where different races and creatures found it difficult to interact with each other.</p>

  <p>In the countless years that passed, the divine land had been embroiled in fatal and chaotic wars. The casualties were innumerable and beyond counting. Some races had been eliminated in the blink of an eye while some races that had tens of billions of clansmen were deemed not qualified enough to leave a mark in the history of the divine land. They were like mere waves in the ocean, disappearing into the whirlpool of history in just a flash, as if they hadn't existed. They were mere specks of dusts in the vast land.</p>

  <p>The races that were able to make it out alive in the chaos, however, were all very proud to have survived the bloodbath. They were no doubt the most powerful and resilient races.</p>

  <p>Endless wars only brought ravaging destruction and total annihilation.</p>

  <p>With the development of civilization, people eventually came together to put an end to the long period of war and death.</p>

  <p>As a result, many Holy Beings joined hands and formed the Hall of Holy Beings. They were given the highest authority in the entire divine land as they were entrusted to keep the peace all throughout the lands.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the Hall of Holy Beings eventually stabilized the entire divine land, heralding a new era of peace among the people, and it had persisted until now.</p>

  <p>But despite its existence, the battles between races, warriors, even the Holy Beings had not completely stopped...</p>

  <p>To avoid repeating the same mistakes, their skirmishes were confined to the rules.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would break the rules would surely face the wrath and punishment of the hall.</p>

  <p>The whole process was filled with plots and traps.</p>

  <p>"The master of the Evolutionary Universe and his disciples must have fallen into a trap and received their punishment in the end, but the things involved are very complicated and cannot be explained in just a short time. Moreover, there are many rumors circulating around that may not be true," Liusu cut in. Aleyna glared at her sister, pissed that her sister interrupted her at the most crucial moment.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of the master of the Evolutionary Universe?" Zheng asked, completely immersed in the information they were providing him with.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was eating him up. He knew that the Holy Being had built this universe and had also seen Wynn, one of the Holy Being's disciples, who was hiding in the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he knew nothing about this Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"The master of the Evolutionary Universe is called Mike Luo. He has the same last name as you," Liusu replied with indifference.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Zheng exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>Liusu's answer made his blood boil. Excited, he took deep erratic breaths, his heart hammering so loud in his rib cage that it felt like the girls from the Han Clan could hear his heartbeat clearly.</p>
