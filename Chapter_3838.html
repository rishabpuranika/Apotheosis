<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After a brief exchange with Zheng, the human face in the cube let out a cry brimming with agony.</p>

  <p>The face switched colors between fiery red with frustration to pale white, and then again from pale white to red.</p>

  <p>"Pro...promise me..." He continued to sing, his voice soft and filled with grief. It was as if he was desperately holding on to every ounce of sincerity left within his existence through the painful song.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a strange empathy take over him as he felt his emotions scatter all over the place through the song. Only those who desperately awaited the sweet release of death would display such sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I promise." Zheng gave a slight nod then looked up in his direction.</p>

  <p>"But you have to tell me the situation here first."</p>

  <p>The people who resided in the chaos were left in the dark when it came to the Abstruse Energy World; they knew little to nothing about it.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't as if they had no interest in exploring the world beyond their boundaries. For instance, Ziya and the members of the Element Spirit Civilization harbored an undying passion when it came to exploring the outside world. They had spent most of their lives traveling to discover what lay beyond their world.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was because they were bound by the constraints holding them down as creatures of the chaos that they were unable to go too far...</p>

  <p>Their scenario of entering the Abstruse Energy World could be equated to that of a blind man walking into a colorful world. Witnessing the whole world in all its contrasts and colors was always considered to be an ambitious thing to accomplish.</p>

  <p>"This is the Eternal Divine Courtyard, which has already been deserted. It was sealed by the Time Lock a long time ago. Logically speaking, no one can approach this place. I don't know how you came in, but since you have come in, I'm assuming your goal must be for the origin-level bloodline, right?" the face asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is correct." Zheng nodded in response as he captured several words that the face had said.</p>

  <p>Eternal Divine Courtyard, Time Lock, deserted... All these things the face had said left Zheng in a daze, his thoughts running amok in his head.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to a deserted land?</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Divine Courtyard is the land where they keep their bloodlines.</p>

  <p>The root-level bloodlines are hidden in the lower layer, and the origin-level bloodlines are hidden in the second layer. While that place..." The face took a short pause between his explanation to look upwards, before saying,</p>

  <p>"That's where the ancestry-level bloodline is."</p>

  <p>"Ancestry-level?" Zheng blinked several times, taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ancestry-level bloodline! That's what provided them with a foundation to gain a firm foothold and also the foundation for them to fight other worlds..." The more he explained the mechanisms of the world, the more his expressions overflowed with overwhelming excitement. He grew red as if he had used all his strength to talk. "You should be grateful for the existence of the Time Lock. They thought no one could enter this deserted Eternal Divine Courtyard. Otherwise, you would have been long doomed.</p>

  <p>Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Zheng took his time to examine this mad guy in utter bewilderment. He was lost for words for a moment.</p>

  <p>As per the face's statements, he had stumbled upon a place that restricted outsiders from breaching its boundaries.</p>

  <p>Or maybe, the small passage Zheng came through of the Eternal Scroll Painting had been built a long time ago. It was possible for the so-called "they" the face spoke of to have overlooked it when they used the Time Lock to seal off the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Because of that, Zheng was able to trespass on their land under fortunate circumstances Zheng assumed that to be the case.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. The ancestry-level bloodline is right above there. You must get it. They might never have expected that one day an outsider would enter here..."</p>

  <p>After the man went on talking for a fair amount of time, he suddenly went quiet abruptly. It was as if he remembered something he initially set out to do. He looked at Zheng and spoke straightforwardly, "Now that I've told you all you need to know. You must kill me."</p>

  <p>His eyes gleamed with vibrant color; they depicted vivid traces of slyness.</p>

  <p>"You need to tell me how to get to the upper layer first," Zheng said as he looked at the face and pointed upwards. Zheng didn't notice any other crack in this space.</p>

  <p>"No. You have to kill me first," the man demanded with a firm tone as he pressed Zheng to give him what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced over at the face to read his expressions: he now looked impatient, his eyes more desperate than ever. Slowly switching his gaze from the man to the space ahead of him, Zheng shrugged his shoulders indifferently and said in a solemn voice, "If that's how it is, then I apologize. I guess I'll have to look for it myself."</p>

  <p>When he finished declaring his intentions, Zheng slowly began to ascend upwards.</p>

  <p>"No! Please, stop!"</p>

  <p>Now in a panicked state, the man let out a desperate cry. In a moment of desperation he pounced towards Zheng, completely forgetting the fact that Zheng was outside the cube.</p>

  <p>However, the cube was exceptionally rigid; it was crafted with no margin for errors. Thus, it was almost impossible to break through from the inside.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>With a series of blows that landed directly on the shackle, the man attempted to escape the prison he was in. But it was all to no avail. No matter how high of energy he exerted on the cube, it refused to budge. To his dismay, it just rotated in place, mocking him in all his failed attempts.</p>

  <p>When he tried to hit the cube with all his might, every detail of his physique lay bare to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The upper portion of his body, from his abdomen to his face, appeared to be human. However, the lower part had eight sharp legs, like that of a spider.</p>

  <p>At the ends of each leg was an eye that shot sharp light columns to bombard the cube with continuous attacks.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>His constant blows immersed in his fury fluctuated in the form of terrifying energy that enveloped the cube. Even though the cube successfully absorbed all of his intense attacks, it still surprised Zheng as he watched without blinking even once.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved a sigh of relief in his thoughts as he made the right call of not releasing him.</p>

  <p>With eyes full of despair, the man saw Zheng ascend into the sky and grow smaller in size as he slowly went out of sight. Dropping everything, he stopped struggling to fight his fate and slumped back down.</p>

  <p>Being locked up in the same place for countless years, he had fantasized about ending his life and escaping this sorry fate more than once.</p>

  <p>Regardless of his situation, he still held a small glimmer of hope. What if someone were to reset this Eternal Divine Courtyard?</p>

  <p>He knew his wish had slim chances of coming true. Even so, he lived on harboring grave agony in his restricted space. But now, this opportunity finally came face to face with him.</p>

  <p>People outside could freely enter the cube. As long as anything outside came in contact with him, he would be able to walk out of the cube successfully. At the same time, he would obtain the bloodline at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It was the bloodline of ancestries.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him...</p>

  <p>He finally came so close to achieving all his life-long ambitions, only to have them snatched away from him by Zheng.</p>

  <p>So close, yet so far...</p>

  <p>What was worse was that he had revealed enough information to set Zheng on his way. His initial intentions were merely to gain enough of Zheng's trust to trick him into releasing him, but it backfired.</p>

  <p>Zheng floated above this space, he scanned his surroundings to look for a passageway that would lead him to the upper layer.</p>

  <p>He could feel that what the spider man had told him was not a complete lie.</p>

  <p>There was some truth hidden beneath those words. At least, he had a chance to see what the Abstruse Energy World was like.</p>

  <p>There was also a layer of bronze wall above this space. There were no evident cracks on it, so Zheng naturally couldn't pass through it.</p>

  <p>After examining the bronze wall for a bit and studying its mechanisms, Zheng decided on punching his way through it to pass.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand divine megatons of force exploded in abundance as it hit the bronze wall. It was as if Zheng was pounding on a gigantic drum with his fists. The loud rumbling sound of his fists making contact with the wall echoed throughout the vast space.</p>

  <p>"It's hollow on the inside. Maybe I can break it open by force?"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand divine megatons of force...</p>

  <p>Even when Zheng exerted the limit of the Chaotic Source Spirits and smashed with a force of one hundred thousand divine megatons, it bore no fruit. The bronze wall remained sturdy and stood tall without having moved an inch.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not plan on giving up after coming this far. If one hundred thousand divine megatons of force couldn't break it open, then he would have to wait until the Celestial Spear was fully restored. With the help of the Celestial Spear, he might be able to force it open.</p>

  <p>"You can't open it. Without my guidance, you will never be able to get the ancestry-level bloodline..." The spider man in the cube below began to sing again after having witnessed Zheng struggling to get past. "I can make a deal with you, as long as you..."</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, there's no need to decipher his words,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said abruptly.</p>

  <p>Even if he could release this spider man without himself getting hurt, the latter would probably still kill him the first chance he'd get and later obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. There was no point in communicating with him anymore.</p>

  <p>After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization stopped deciphering, the spider man's voice was reduced to a rhythmic wail like that of ghosts and wolves to him.</p>

  <p>Crossing his arms, Zheng stared hard at the bronze wall above his head and processed different ways he could use to get through it in his mind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he stumbled across a clear pattern etched over the bronze wall.</p>

  <p>The pattern had previously been covered by thick dust. As Zheng launched constant blows without pause, the layer of dust was shaken off by the continuous tremors of the bronze wall. Naturally, the pattern that was once veiled by the dust was revealed out in the open.</p>
