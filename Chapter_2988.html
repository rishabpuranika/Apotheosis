<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2988 Cleaning Up </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng had already grabbed the handle of the cyan sword with his left hand.</p>

  <p>As he held the sword handle tightly in his fingers, a repulsive force began to spread out from it. Luo Zheng was being so careless that he nearly let the sword slip out of his hand.</p>

  <p>As he activated the strength source, his left hand firmly gripped the sword, like an iron clamp. As he performed this action, Luo Zheng roared in his mind,</p>

  <p>"It's your turn to make a move!"</p>

  <p>The sclerite on Luo Zheng's chest flashed lightly, and No. 9527 entered the long sword at once.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>The ghost followed closely behind, rushing toward Luo Zheng as quickly as it could.</p>

  <p>Beneath the terrifying and evil pressure coming from the soul's aura, Luo Zheng could hardly breathe.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Zheng had been forced into a corner, and there was almost no way out. Even if he used the Grand Teleportation, he knew he'd still be interrupted by the ghost. The scene of how the man in purple's life ended was still very fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>If No. 9527 was incapable of dealing with the cyan sword, Luo Zheng's life would probably end in the same way. He looked very nervous, and with absolute reason.</p>

  <p>"Ahoo!"</p>

  <p>As the ghost howled, its dark brown arms extended toward Luo Zheng in an attempt to grab him, giving no forewarning whatsoever. Luo Zheng suddenly realized that the repulsive force emitting from the sword handle had disappeared, and the ghost's body had also frozen in midair, completely motionlessly.</p>

  <p>There were certain, rather specific reasons for the formation of most evil ghosts. The main reason was that people's souls contained both obsession and hatred, which intertwined with each other, causing the remnant souls to lose themselves and become abnormally vicious.</p>

  <p>Once the obsession disappeared, however, the evil ghosts would lose their meaning of existence.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 understood the reason why this ghost was formed, which was also why it let Luo Zheng take the risk. As soon as it entered the cyan sword and wiped off the Stinger Guard's obsession, the ghost's ferocious aura dissipated in an instant.</p>

  <p>The originally fierce and evil ghost actually transformed itself into a pure soul force. The hazel aura dispersed in all directions at once.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you doing? It has swallowed countless souls! Its soul force is strong and pure. Its effect is even better than that of the soul pills.</p>

  <p>Absorb it quickly," No. 9527 urged.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Luo Zheng saw the soul force flowing in all directions that he realized its genuine value. With a flash of his eyes, his soul transformed into tentacles and he spread them outward, beginning to absorb the soul force around him.</p>

  <p>In the matter of just a few seconds, Luo Zheng had absorbed all of the pure soul force!</p>

  <p>Because the soul force was extremely pure, it didn't reject in the slightest Luo Zheng's soul, quickly making his Soul of Light even stronger.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the soul force, Luo Zheng immediately felt freshened. Even his ears and eyes became more sensitive. His senses had peaked.</p>

  <p>"Just moments ago, everything was so dangerous. If you couldn't get rid of the cyan sword's obsession, I might just have died here today," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible? It's just a remnant soul from an Other Shore Realm warrior," No. 9527 grumbled in a disdainful tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled helplessly. It was easy for it to say that, sure, but breaking the obsession was much more complicated than it was making it sound.</p>

  <p>He held the cyan sword confidently in his hand and studied it carefully. He turned the weapon over and over again, observing its every angle. It was a good sword, but it seemed to have eroded over time and thus had little value to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, he checked the clothes in the tomb. As he flipped through the clothes, an octagonal copper sheet dropped to the floor.</p>

  <p>The copper sheet was about the size of a palm. It looked ordinary, but Luo Zheng picked it up in his hand immediately in order to get a closer look. The small, fine lines in the middle of the copper sheet extended to all directions, seemingly following some unknown rule. Luo Zheng observed the small copper-colored sheet for a long while and still, he remained clueless.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else in the tomb. Aside from some clothes, there was only the small copper sheet that was kept here. Luo Zheng could only assume that it should have some kind of origin, and therefore he put it into his space ring.</p>

  <p>It was at that point that Luo Zheng looked at the three corpses lying on the ground not far away. With only a light move of his body, he took the things stored in their Sumeru Spaces. Although Luo Zheng had countless divine crystals with him, he knew he couldn't solve everything with them. If he could find something useful from the corpses, he might save himself a little trouble.</p>

  <p>In addition to these three corpses, Luo Zheng had also knocked Artie out, who was now equally lying on the ground, half-dead.</p>

  <p>And Tanner, the warrior who attracted the man in purple to come here, had passed out due to the roar from the ghost in the tomb, lying motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>He would leave these two people to Kenelm, letting him decide their fate instead.</p>

  <p>When he finished all the things he needed to do, he awakened Kenelm and all the others.</p>

  <p>The ghost's roar in the graveyard contained powerful soul attacks. Although they had the Souls of Light, they were far from capable of resisting soul attacks of that level.</p>

  <p>They'd waken up now, but they still held their heads with their hands and looked miserable for a while.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was the first of the group to recover. When he opened his eyes and saw the scene in the cave, he was shocked. "Uh, is that ghost in the tomb really dead?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded silently.</p>

  <p>"Man, I thought I was doomed." Surprise was written all over his face. "Did you kill the ghost, Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head in denial. "I don't have the ability to kill it. A few moments ago, the man in purple activated the Latent token before he died, which in turn, severely injured the ghost. The ghost then killed him."</p>

  <p>The truth didn't matter now - no one had seen what had happened just before, and Luo Zheng naturally wouldn't admit that it was him who killed the ghost.</p>

  <p>"With such a powerful Latent token, the man in purple must have an extraordinary background," said Kenelm, with a cautious look on his face.</p>

  <p>Although the Gracious Province was a remote place, Kenelm couldn't afford to offend any of the big clans. If the big clans were to find out about what happened today, they would be in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>"We have no choice but to dispose of the bodies and get rid of the evidence," said one of Kenelm's friends.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't strong enough, they were all clear-minded. Cleaning everything up and wiping the traces down were a means of survival.</p>

  <p>"And Tanner must also die!" As Kenelm glanced at Tanner, who was lying on the ground, flames of anger burned in his eyes. All the things that had happened were caused by him. He naturally had to vent his anger on him; it was to be expected.</p>

  <p>After Kenelm ended Tanner's life and someone else killed Artie, they put all the corpses together and burned them to ashes.</p>

  <p>At once, their gazes fell on the cyan sword!</p>

  <p>"After the death of any Stinger Guard of the Sword Light Palace, if anyone packs their effects and returns them to the Sword Light Palace, they could obtain the qualification for joining the Sword Light Palace. Let's take these belongings and long sword back to the Excellence City and report to the Sword Light Palace," said Kenelm eagerly.</p>

  <p>Although he listened to the others speak, Luo Zheng didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Before coming here, he had heard Kenelm say such things. That said though, he was suspicious of this rumor.</p>

  <p>If this Sword Light Palace really was some famous force, how could they use this method for selecting disciples to join them?</p>
