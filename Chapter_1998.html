</p>

  <p>Within the Demon Night, this Inauguration Altar was known as the holy place of pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>Although many of the Demon Night warriors' strength wasn't considered powerful, because they worshiped their queens so highly, many of them would come here from various supreme worlds in order to cultivate.</p>

  <p>These Demon Night members would worship their queens every day though, and some even gave up on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>These members were called pilgrims.</p>

  <p>For even the strongest of powerful pilgrims, it usually took them years to travel a long distance to reach here from other supreme worlds. With time though, most of them could manage to make it. However, for the weak pilgrims, they'd probably spend their entire life on the road. Even before their lifespan ran out, it would still be difficult for them to reach the Rosy Cloud World, let alone personally see the Inauguration Altar!</p>

  <p>The Inauguration Altar was incomparably huge. And around the Inauguration Altar was an even greater platform - millions of feet in diameter. On this platform were many warriors of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Much like the followers of the secret sect in the Thoughtless Minds, the warriors were prostrating on the ground and in their hearts, they knew that the queens were the supreme existences as well as the True Gods that had protected them.</p>

  <p>Although most of the sacred places of the Rosy Cloud World were in complete chaos, the great platform surrounding the Inauguration Altar remained solemn and quiet. No one dared to make a ruckus here.</p>

  <p>"It's Leroy! Supreme Lord Leroy has come to the Inauguration Altar!"</p>

  <p>Someone from the crowd was shouting.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had led the group of Demon Night warriors to this location. With thousands of warriors following him, he had of course attracted the attention of quite a few people.</p>

  <p>Although Leroy hadn't made an appearance for many years now, most of the people present still recognized him.</p>

  <p>The loud shouting immediately broke the silence. Countless members of the Demon Night widened their eyes and looked toward the sky.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had been the one to issue the queen's order, and his name had spread far and wide among the Demon Night in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>A few warriors completely viewed him as the only savior of the Demon Night race, the only one capable of saving them from this dire situation.</p>

  <p>However, at the same time, there were also certain members who viewed him as a traitor, as someone who had broken the rules that the Demon Night race had set and followed for countless years!</p>

  <p>In the dense crowd, a minimum of ten people watched Leroy closely, like a group of hawks. The group nodded at each other, their faces turned vicious!</p>

  <p>One of them infused his life vitality into his voice, and suddenly shouted towards the sky, "Traitor! The Queen of Killings of our Demon Night has long perished. Since you have falsely passed on the queen's order, you will be punished with death!"</p>

  <p>These pilgrims were totally blinded by their beliefs. They had even given up on cultivation. Now, they only wanted to contribute their faith.</p>

  <p>Without the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, these blind martial artists could easily be manipulated!</p>

  <p>The debate in the past few days had been limited to the various sacred places and hadn't yet affected the Inauguration Alta. Perhaps these pilgrims had heard rumors about the queen's order, but the vast majority of them hadn't been able to clearly discern the truth behind it. To them, there was little importance to who was going to be crowned queen of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you kneeling down before the Inauguration Altar, begging for forgiveness from all the queens of our Demon Night throughout the ages?!" Another person from the crowd was now shouting, too.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy wants to usurp the throne! He wants to destroy the Pools of Faith and break the unity of our Demon Night!"</p>

  <p>"Every one of the Demon Night race will sacrifice their lives in order to keep this demon out of here!"</p>

  <p>Plenty of martial artists in the crowd were now calling out, one after the other.</p>

  <p>The martial artists that lurked in the crowd used their life vitality to shout in an attempt to get all the Demon Night members to hear them. By doing this, they were trying to misguide them with their incendiary remarks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow creased slightly when he heard these loud, confident voices.</p>

  <p>The voices coming from below were obviously extremely strange. In his opinion, it was likely that someone was purposefully spreading such words?</p>

  <p>And although the method was extremely vile, it was actually extremely effective at the same time!</p>

  <p>These words quickly influenced the emotions of the pilgrims below.</p>

  <p>They glared at Supreme Lord Leroy, who was floating in the sky above.</p>

  <p>There were close to a million Demon Night pilgrims on the square. Most of them were weak in cultivation, and even more so, a few of the Demon Night members were only nature creatures, which were no different than mortals in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>However, these people had no fear of a mighty Supreme Lord. Under the queens' protection, there was not a single trace of hesitation in these pilgrims.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>With a cold snort, Leroy raised the short bow in his hand. His movement was so fast that no one had seen how, or even when, the arrow had been shot. What they could see though, was a minimum of ten golden sparks suddenly appear in front of Leroy and shoot out in different directions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Although the martial artists were hiding in the crowd, Leroy's judgment was extremely accurate. The golden Scorching Sun Arrows shot through the crowd, accurately nailing down the martial artists that had spread the words in an attempt to mislead the others!</p>

  <p>Although Leroy had casually shot these Scorching Sun Arrows, warriors beyond the level of grand world lords wouldn't have any power to defend against the attack.</p>

  <p>Blood splattered out from amongst the crowd, and a few of the pilgrims let out terrified screams. Unfortunately, Leroy's actions had caused them to become even more furious. Certain martial artists were even jumping out to insult him!</p>

  <p>"Leroy, how dare you slaughter your own kind before the Inauguration Altar?! How disrespectful!"</p>

  <p>"Our race's Queen of Killings actually chose someone like you to become a Supreme Lord, clearly she was too blind!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked down at the increasingly noisy crowd and asked, "What are they trying to do? It doesn't seem to make much sense to me."</p>

  <p>Leroy narrowed his eyes and pondered. Suddenly, he seemed to recall something important. His expression changed slightly as he grabbed Luo Luo Zheng and flew swiftly towards the Inauguration Altar. "We might be in trouble.</p>

  <p>Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Supreme Lord Leroy so anxious, Luo Luo Zheng too felt even more perplexed. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yao seems to have been well prepared. She actually arranged for such a group of fellows who don't care for their lives. It looks like they want to activate the Faith Trial and block us from the Inauguration Altar. I had forgotten about this!" By the time Leroy had finished speaking, he and Luo Luo Zheng had reached the front of the enormous Inauguration Altar. Here, they stopped.</p>

  <p>This was when Luo Luo Zheng finally found the chance to ask, "And what exactly is the Faith Trial?"</p>

  <p>Leroy revealed a regretful expression. He stared straight through Luo Luo Zheng and said, "That is the Faith Trial."</p>

  <p>The Inauguration Altar was the foundation of all queens. Once the Inauguration Altar was destroyed, the queens' strength would equally be greatly reduced! Thus, and for good reason, the Inauguration Altar was most likely the most heavily guarded area. And the outermost layer of defense was this Faith Trial!</p>

  <p>And the right to start this Faith Trial was not held within just one single person, no, but rather in the millions of pilgrims on the platform!</p>

  <p>When these pilgrims decided that someone was not qualified to approach the Inauguration Altar, the Faith Trial would be activated!</p>

  <p>Yao though, had already arranged for daredevils to spread a few rumors among these pilgrims. After the appearance of the Supreme Lord Leroy, the said daredevils risked their lives to slander him. In this way, Yao had easily succeeded in making the crowd hate Leroy!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, she had also calculated that Leroy would take action to kill these daredevils, and she had thus purposely arranged for several batches of daredevils to complete the mission. When the first batch of daredevils were killed by Leroy, the second batch of daredevils would continue to slander him.</p>

  <p>With the constant slander, a few of the pilgrims who didn't know the truth started to view Leroy as an enemy. They all glared at him, suddenly seeing him as a nemesis of the Demon Night! Not all pilgrims were so brainless, however, the world would always be made up of people who didn't know the entire truth.</p>

  <p>Because most of the pilgrims saw Leroy as an enemy, the first layer of protection on the Inauguration Altar, the Faith Trial, was put into effect.</p>

  <p>The massive Inauguration Altar was a tower in a triple diamond shape.</p>

  <p>Where these three diamonds connected were the stairs to walk up to the Inauguration Altar. As the Faith Trial was activated, three bands of pure colorful light began to emit from the tower!</p>

  <p>The three bands of light were distinctively red, blue, and green. These were the colors of the three Demon Night queens' Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The three bands of light floated in the air and began to condense. In no time, the beams began to transform into human figures, one after the next.</p>

  <p>Seeing the human figures that were slowly condensing in the sky, Leroy retreated a few steps. "These Faith Energies have condensed into the Faith Bodies of the Demon Night queens throughout the ages. You have to be careful!"</p>

  <p>"How strong are they?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, as he stared at the bright beams of light that continuously swerved and swiveled, changing shapes completely.</p>

  <p>"They are on par with the grand world lords," Leroy replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"They may be at the level of grand world lords, but you're a Supreme Lord," Luo Luo Zheng snickered. "What's there to worry about?"</p>

  <p>Leroy stared at Luo Luo Zheng. "I'm reminding you to be careful! That's all."</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, a red figure had now been formed entirely.</p>

  <p>This red figure was the Demon Night race's thirteenth Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>Although the Faith Body was still blurry, it was possible for one to see her beautiful features despite the blood-red mist!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Queen of Killings raised her spear and rushed immediately toward Leroy.</p>

  <p>Before Leroy could even think of counterattacking, Luo Luo Zheng was already a step ahead. At the same time as his figure flashed like a gust of wind, he waved his hand toward the thirteenth Queen of Killings, and a terrifying power instantly exploded from his fingertips. Even the ball of Faith Energy that formed the figure couldn't take this much power: it instantly dispersed. As soon as Luo Luo Zheng had killed the Faith Body, he turned his head and smiled at Supreme Lord Leroy. As it turned out, it had been completely unnecessary for Leroy to have reminded Luo Luo Zheng to be careful, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Just for a split-second, Leroy was stunned, but he eventually mumbled,</p>

  <p>"This kid isn't so bad after all..."</p>
