<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the dark palace, Luo Zheng was caught in illusions.</p>

  <p>He had shattered Barnaby's first attack with his Authentic Visual World, so for his second offensive, Barnaby had used sixty percent of his strength.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could even activate the demonic eye, he had been completely trapped within the illusions again.</p>

  <p>He could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Such was Barnaby's strength.</p>

  <p>Being under Barnaby's control, Luo Zheng suddenly felt a sharp pain in his soul.</p>

  <p>It made him tremble and get rid of the illusions.</p>

  <p>"There is another soul in his mind!" Barnaby exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>The one causing the pain was No. 9527.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was left with no choice on seeing Luo Zheng trapped in the illusions. It had to give his soul a ferocious blow, even at the risk of exposing itself.</p>

  <p>The attack, though not very powerful, was effective. It had at least brought Luo Zheng back to his senses.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Natasha asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>She couldn't fathom why a young man of the Lust World would cause Barnaby so much trouble.</p>

  <p>Barnaby's face darkened.</p>

  <p>He had tried to deal with Luo Zheng but his methods didn't work. He felt terribly ashamed by his failure.</p>

  <p>He realized he couldn't afford to underestimate Luo Zheng in any way.</p>

  <p>He was in no mood to analyze the soul hiding within Luo Zheng's body, as he abruptly shook his white robe.</p>

  <p>A big black and white eye emerged on the top of his head, like a human's.</p>

  <p>This was his Other Shore Token; the Illusory Eye.</p>

  <p>"Lady Natasha, take a few steps back please," Barnaby said politely.</p>

  <p>Natasha and the others in black stepped back without hesitation, filled with fear of his Illusory Eye.</p>

  <p>Barnaby had set his mind on using one hundred percent of his strength this time. He was sure if he didn't hold back, there'd be no possible way Luo Zheng could escape the illusions.</p>

  <p>"Good luck," No. 9527 said helplessly. It had done all it could.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart sank in defeat as he looked at the Illusory Eye. He knew this time, he was doomed.</p>

  <p>The Illusory Eye blinked and a swirl of patterns took shape in it. Luo Zheng followed and blinked his eyes involuntarily.</p>

  <p>When the Illusory Eye blinked again, he blinked again too.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng could do nothing to resist. His eyes glazed over and turned dull as they were lost to him.</p>

  <p>Barnaby couldn't bear having failed twice already. If he had failed once more, he felt he would have smashed his head through a wall.</p>

  <p>"Now follow me to explore the secrets of the extreme joy," Barnaby recited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, like a puppet, repeated back, "I will follow you to explore the secrets of the extreme joy."</p>

  <p>"Obey my orders," Barnaby continued.</p>

  <p>"I will obey your orders," Luo Zheng replied zombified.</p>

  <p>"Give me the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent,"</p>

  <p>Barnaby ordered, shooting a devious smile at Natasha.</p>

  <p>Her face lit up. With a wave of her hand, the brush and ink floated towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He took the brush and began scribbling on the white paper.</p>

  <p>Word by word, the Truth Enlightenment appeared.</p>

  <p>"Finally we've got it!"</p>

  <p>Natasha shrieked excitedly.</p>

  <p>Finally, after so much trouble and effort, they had the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Twenty words.</p>

  <p>Fifty words.</p>

  <p>Eighty words.</p>

  <p>The paper was filled with more and more words.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng finished writing more than one hundred words, Barnaby and Natasha sensed something. Suddenly, their faces changed and they were no longer so excited and confident.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The brush, ink and paper flew back towards Natasha at once. "Get Luo Zheng out of here!" she bellowed.</p>

  <p>Barnaby began waving his arms and was about to lead Luo Zheng to an escape when a loud explosion rang out from the ceiling of the palace.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The ceiling cracked.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A huge hole opened as the ceiling was destroyed by the second explosion.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe then descended through the hole.</p>

  <p>Barnaby still tried to lead Luo Zheng away. Qiu Yinhe noticed his shuffling and a stern expression took over his face as he gestured forward towards them.</p>

  <p>A touch of sword radiance turned into thousands of waves and rushed at Barnaby to stop him in his tracks.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Natasha gently stretched her body.</p>

  <p>The space in the palace began to twist. The waves of the sword radiance released by Qiu Yinhe were cut into several pieces, swishing about madly.</p>

  <p>"Even your Emperor Gethin has given up but you still choose to struggle.</p>

  <p>Do you really want to die?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe was truly infuriated.</p>

  <p>He stamped his foot down hard, and a circle of sword marks appeared around him.</p>

  <p>In a flash, countless mysterious textures spread throughout the palace. The bodies of the men in black robes, Natasha, and even Barnaby and Luo Zheng were engulfed in the strange textures.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The palace was quite sturdy. Qiu Yinhe had struck it twice in order to enter earlier.</p>

  <p>Now, the palace collapsed in an instant, turning to a mess of tiny shards.</p>

  <p>The shards were the same as the textures that Qiu Yinhe had set, their edges as sharp and smooth as knives.</p>
