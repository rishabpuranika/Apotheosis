<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2002 Rival A Supreme Lord </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Against the will of worlds, all concealment was useless.</p>

  <p>This world was made up of complex materials: rocks, air, water, mountains, and an assortment of living creatures.</p>

  <p>As for the will of worlds, it recorded everything that passed and stayed in the universe. Luo Luo Zheng could instantly tell how many mountains and stones were in a supreme world, and where people were at all times.</p>

  <p>However, the worlds' will also had its limitations.</p>

  <p>When the will had just covered the entire great world, he wasn't able to detect any movement from the martial artists in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But now that it already covered all the supreme worlds of the Demon Night race, human warriors were the only remaining ones Luo Luo Zheng could not detect.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the will was still expanding. In the future, when it already spread throughout the whole universe, Luo Luo Zheng would be god of omniscience.</p>

  <p>Nothing in the entire universe would be kept secret from him. He would have all the memories of the worlds' will, and the Sacred race would be the only ones he'd be unable to detect. They had, after all, come from the Murphy Universe, and the worlds' will was unable to enter their universe.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was born into the Demon Night race, so he wasn't exempt from the worlds' will.</p>

  <p>In fact, not only did Luo Luo Zheng see Supreme Lord Shadow's current movements, Luo Luo Zheng was also able to peek into the memories of his past.</p>

  <p>Most of these memories were so old, Supreme Lord Shadow probably didn't remember them anymore.</p>

  <p>This was the first time Luo Luo Zheng faced a Supreme Lord head on. And although he had a relaxed expression on his face, he was completely alert and aware of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was constantly moving in the shadows.</p>

  <p>The boy in front of him was much more troublesome than he had expected. Feeling unsatisfied with Supreme Lord Korbin's decision, Supreme Lord Shadow grudgingly thought how it would be more satisfying facing Leroy instead.</p>

  <p>But even though it was tricky, it wasn't like he couldn't do anything about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was just a shriveled up hedgehog. He hadn't found a flaw yet but the moment he did, it would mean the end for this kid.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow moved faster and faster in the shadows.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also spun in the air, the smile on his face gradually vanishing.</p>

  <p>Even though the worlds' will could capture anything, it was still trouble if Supreme Lord Shadow's speed surpassed Luo Zheng's reaction speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow seemed to realize this too, as he came out of his hiding place. His speed immediately doubled, causing blurred afterimages to follow him as he spun in the air.</p>

  <p>Leroy frowned. Just like how Supreme Lord Shadow and Supreme Lord Korbin understood him, Leroy also understood Supreme Lord Shadow's methods. He was like an assassin. He gathered energy before the battle but once he took his move, he could kill his opponent with a single strike.</p>

  <p>In terms of speed, this fellow had the advantage.</p>

  <p>Leroy's eyes gleamed as he readied to shoot at Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>He couldn't just stand by and watch Luo Luo Zheng get killed. After all, he wouldn't be able to enter the Inauguration Altar without Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Korbin was already in front of him before he could release the arrow. A cyan flame flickered in his hand like a lotus.</p>

  <p>"Your opponent is me."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin smiled and allowed the flames to sweep at Leroy.</p>

  <p>Hence, the two Supreme Lords began to fight again.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow's speed made it difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to catch him.</p>

  <p>With a flash of killing intent in his eyes, Supreme Lord Shadow suddenly changed course and dove for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were no afterimages this time. Such speed did not leave any traces as it was impossible for one to follow the movement.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Shadow disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng let out an alarmed shout.</p>

  <p>His right hand was still gripping his space ring. The moment Supreme Lord Shadow disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng immediately pulled out the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>Having no time to think, Luo Luo Zheng instinctively slashed the weapon to the side.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't even sure if it could be called a slash. When Luo Luo Zheng used the worlds' will to locate Supreme Lord Shadow, he found the distance between them had been too close. Unable to adjust the edge of the Great Weighty Sword, he just used it like a club and hit where he thought the Supreme Lord was going to be.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>With a dull boom, the Great Weighty Sword hit Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>The weight of the sword was terrifying.</p>

  <p>When it crashed into Supreme Lord Shadow's chest, all of his ribs shattered.</p>

  <p>It was like a massive being sat on his body. Like a broken kite, he was forced backward and was sent flying faster than before.</p>

  <p>He reached a distance of three thousand miles before he collided into the nearest sacred place to the Inauguration Altar. He probably also destroyed tens of thousands of trees along the way.</p>

  <p>A massive crater had formed in the center of the sacred place and the Supreme Lord lay in the center of it, dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>Feeling a warmth in his throat, he flipped to his stomach and doubled over. "Puff!"</p>

  <p>Blood sprayed out from his mouth.</p>

  <p>This time though, he spat ten times more blood than before.</p>

  <p>All of his ribs were broken and his organs had been crushed to a pulp. If he were any other martial artist, they would have already been on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>With his teeth clenched, he took out a golden pill from his sleeve and popped it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that in just a short period of time, he had already been beaten twice by a world lord to the point of coughing out blood.</p>

  <p>How humiliating..</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow leaped out from the crater, his expression unpaintable. His eyes flashed as he discovered the martial artists hiding in the trees.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his hand, a sharp gust of wind rushed through the warriors' bodies. In a matter of seconds, they began to tremble and stiffen, and cracks began to form on their bodies. Blood flowed from the cracks before they collapsed into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>With a grunt, Supreme Lord Shadow flew towards the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>He felt sad and wronged. Luo Luo Zheng was being unreasonable. What right did he have to make a Supreme Lord vomit blood twice?</p>

  <p>He was beginning to doubt both his strength and Supreme Lord Korbin's judgement. 'Should we really be involved in this?'</p>

  <p>If he allowed Luo Luo Zheng to grow, the guy would probably go against the heavens in only a few years. And by then, it wouldn't be impossible for him to help the human race get rid of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>However, people at their level rarely regretted anything. Once they made up their minds, it was impossible to stop them. Besides, he and Supreme Lord Korbin had already formed enmity with Luo Luo Zheng. They couldn't turn back now.</p>

  <p>"Good..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow activated the Grand Teleportation and once again appeared before Luo Luo Zheng. "It seems like I shouldn't have treated you as a junior," he said. "I shouldn't have regarded you as a world lord as well.</p>

  <p>In fact, you have the strength to rival a Supreme Lord!"</p>

  <p>His evaluation was extremely high.</p>

  <p>Some outstanding world lords and grand world lords had the strength to fight each other, but the disparity between a grand world lord and a Supreme Lord was simply too great. After all, the Heavenly Destiny carried by a Supreme Lord was something that a grand world lord would never be able to contend with.</p>
