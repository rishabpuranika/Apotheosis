<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2802 Two Light Balls </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what was hiding in the lair. But it was likely that once the alliance of the powerful clans entered, they would be killed.</p>

  <p>It was not a big deal for the Holy Beings if they died, because it would not take long for them to be reborn. However, for the case of the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods, it would not be possible for them to come back to life.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down."</p>

  <p>Nicholas gave an order after thinking for a while.</p>

  <p>According to the woman, the True Demon Body should be found in the lair.</p>

  <p>Now that he had come this far, it was even more impossible for him to give up.</p>

  <p>Hearing Nicholas' words, the others were a little disappointed. They had no other choice but to go through the crack, thinking that they could at least temporarily avoid the Cold Fiends.</p>

  <p>"The internal space is so vast. There are two beautiful stars."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated in the void and looked around. He never expected that there was a boundless void in the Cold Fiends' lair.</p>

  <p>Two giant light balls floated in the center of the void. One was blazing red like the sun, and the other emitted a cool blue light, like a blue star.</p>

  <p>"The first time I came in, I was also surprised," the woman said with a nod.</p>

  <p>"This is not the first time you have been here?" Luo Zheng heard her and asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," the woman said with a small smile.</p>

  <p>Since it was successful to use Sword Chen's clones to get to the bottom of the ice volcano, she could naturally break into the lair.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas had obediently destroyed the Cold Fiends' lair just now, the alliance of the powerful clans wouldn't have suffered so many casualties.</p>

  <p>"But I failed many times, even though it was just in front of me," the woman admitted.</p>

  <p>She was currently referring to the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>From the crack she had created, the clones of the Holy Beings came in one after another. The woman took a look at them and added, "There will be no more accidents this time."</p>

  <p>Sword Chen went in after the group of Holy Beings' clones went forward.</p>

  <p>Then the consummate True Gods, Demi-holy Beings, and Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans also came in.</p>

  <p>A few members from the alliance of the powerful clans were killed in the Abyss Demon Region, but there were still over a hundred of them who persisted. They were able to keep their lives when they reached the ice volcano.</p>

  <p>But right after they entered the ice volcano, the number of deaths had increased continuously.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone who remained had entered, someone discreetly counted their number. He found out that there were just fifty people who were left.</p>

  <p>Most of the younger generation had a straight face. The impact of the continuous death of Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings had given them considerable psychological pressure. They were surely given a blow even though they had reached the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>A faint grudge against Nicholas had even arose in some people's hearts.</p>

  <p>He was blamed since it was he who led all throughout and eventually took them to head for their doom.</p>

  <p>But they just kept their hidden feelings in the back of their minds, and certainly didn't dare to speak them out.</p>

  <p>The woman floated lightly in the air. She looked at Nicholas who just came in and asked, "Do you still want to fight? I won't refuse if you want."</p>

  <p>The clones on her side were not injured and obviously not fewer compared to Nicholas' side. The combat power of the Holy Beings following her was probably even stronger.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans had some Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods, but even if they joined the fight, their efforts wouldn't really play a decisive role.</p>

  <p>Looking at the woman's defiant eyes, Nicholas narrowed his eyes and said,</p>

  <p>"If you want to fight, we won't refuse either!"</p>

  <p>His tone was unyielding, but everyone felt that he had rather compromised.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of the powerful clans hearing his statement were finally relieved. They didn't want to risk their lives in this place anymore.</p>

  <p>The woman's mouth curled up slightly. She turned around to look at Luo Zheng and said, "Let's go." She then pulled him and moved forward.</p>

  <p>They traveled through the void for some time, and the two huge light balls in the distance became clearer as time went by.</p>

  <p>"The cold air... It's indeed the cold air that the Cold Fiends spat out," Luo Zheng uttered in realization as he felt the coldness. "But this red light ball... Is it from the Explosive Crystals that exploded at the grooves?"</p>

  <p>"You're right," the woman responded and smiled. "The red light ball is the energy of the Explosive Crystals. Look at the light ball carefully. What can you see?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed into the distance following what she said.</p>

  <p>He saw that each of the two light balls had a figure curling up in it. The figure was very thin, and looked like a young girl that hadn't grown up yet.</p>

  <p>After observing closely, he immediately associated it with the corpse in the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>"Is the True Demon Body here? Why are there two of them?" He asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The woman responded in a light tone, "It should only be one. They are just two forms of the True Demon Body."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" He was more confused by what the woman disclosed.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in a minute."</p>

  <p>The woman abruptly stopped when she was in a distance of over ten thousand feet away from the two giant light balls.</p>

  <p>From their location, it could be seen that the red light ball on the left brought blazing air and they felt as if they were roasted by roaring flames, while the cold air from the right one chilled them to the bone as if they were in a world of ice and snow.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at the light balls and continued, "Actually, the True Demon Body itself is a kind of talent used to transform energy freely. The blue light ball contains cold air, which is the energy solidified by the True Demon Body."</p>

  <p>Her voice was not loud, but since no sound could be heard in the void, even the members of the alliance of the powerful clans could hear her words clearly and precisely.</p>

  <p>It also made them curious about the two giant light balls and they had noticed the girls inside. Now, everyone was listening to the woman's speech carefully.</p>

  <p>"Energy solidification... Why is it so cold?" Luo Zheng continued to ask in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>In his own view, energy solidification should be a form of energy shaping.</p>

  <p>An example was the strength source which was made into various shapes, or the purple aura which was transformed into various living creatures.</p>

  <p>These were the manifestations of energy solidification for his understanding.</p>

  <p>The woman answered faintly, "It is not the energy solidification in your thought."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she stretched out her hand towards Luo Zheng. The brown energy condensed in her palm was the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked back at her in confusion. He wondered what kind of magic she was going to do.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear suddenly began to spin in a violent manner.</p>
