<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The real Buddha Emperor Sword had blood grooves on the body, and the word "kill" was carved in the wheel.</p>

  <p>After the opponent was killed, the blood would flow along the blood grooves and fuse with the word "kill". With the divine textures around, more malicious aura would be condensed.</p>

  <p>As per Joy's strict instructions, Zheng restored all the details of the Buddha Emperor Sword, including the word "kill", which was floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Yilia stared at the sword in front of her with surprise.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng had used the Cross-world Theurgy before, but no one had recognized it. After all, no one could even imagine that a proving godly warrior could use the skill of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p id="top_22">Besides, back then, Zheng had used the most basic skill of the theurgy without having a deep understanding of Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>"This is the Power Shaping of the Might Godly Way!" Yilia stared incredulously at the Buddha Emperor Sword. The power was invisible, so she could only see a vague outline of the sword. And yet, at the same time, she could see her blood flowing slowly along the blood grooves, forming the word "kill".</p>

  <p>"This is not right at all!" she exclaimed. Then, she added in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"The power can't be separated from your body! And even if it can, once it's broken by my Parting Water Divine Mirror, it should be completely impossible for you to shape anything again. How did you do that?"</p>

  <p>The passageway that Yilia had opened just now had disappeared, leaving Zheng completely submerged in water and unable to speak. When he heard her words of surprise, he just shrugged his shoulders and, with a light flick of his index finger, sent the Buddha Emperor Sword flying forward until it pierced through Yilia's head.</p>

  <p>Splash.</p>

  <p>Yilia was instantly killed on contact. The Parting Water enveloping Zheng disintegrated and gushed out around him like a torrent. It was a spectacular scene to watch.</p>

  <p>However, the Parting Water did not completely dissipate. A scale on the Infinity Ruler in Zheng's mind had already lit up faintly. He slightly raised his hand, causing some of the Parting Water to turn into crystal water swords and float up.</p>

  <p>If Yilia had seen this, she would have been even more shocked.</p>

  <p>"The Parting Water Godly Way can only be employed in a place with water. That's why Yilia chose such a foggy environment.</p>

  <p>If I'm not around water, I guess I'll have to find another way to employ this Godly Way. Otherwise, the theurgy of the Parting Water Godly Way might be greatly weakened."</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of Zheng's finger, one of the glittering and translucent water swords turned black. It was the Devouring Spirit Turbid Current of the Parting Water Godly Way. As Zheng gently moved his finger, the black water sword shot toward him and immediately corroded his arm.</p>

  <p>"As I expected, this Devouring Spirit Turbid Current can restrain all kinds of magic weapons, and it also has an effect on my physical body.</p>

  <p>No wonder she was so confident earlier! However, this theurgy doesn't mean much to me. On the other hand, the Parting Water Divine Mirror that she used just now could copy my attack and it was almost as powerful as the original."</p>

  <p>Continuing to experiment with his newfound knowledge, Zheng reached out his hand and patted the air gently, turning the Parting Water into a mirror. The Parting Water Divine Mirror in front of him was not as good as the one that Yilia had employed. However, he was amazed to know that the theurgy could copy his Buddha Emperor Sword. If he could cultivate the Parting Water Divine Mirror to the top level, he would be able to effectively copy the attack of any opponent.</p>

  <p>This was indeed an extraordinary method to use in any battle.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was pondering over this method, the space surrounding him slowly receded along with the Parting Water Divine Mirror. Zheng found himself back in his room.</p>

  <p>He had no idea that the Parting Water Divine Mirror was a secret of the Fang Clan. In fact, until now, Yilia and Shahn were the only ones who had inherited it. Zheng had managed to easily break the Parting Water Divine Mirror mainly because of a coincidence. The Buddha Emperor Sword was very special because it could only be condensed by pure strength. After divorcing from one's body, the Buddha Emperor Sword could retain its shape by using the Cross-world Theurgy to provide the strength source continuously.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had used any another theurgy, Yilia could have controlled the sword easily as long as she infused her own momentum. But since it was impossible for her to have the Cross-world Theurgy, she had been unable to restore the collapsed duplication of the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>Although Yilia had ranked just 196th in the Arena of Legends, she had already thoroughly studied Zheng, which had taken Zheng by great surprise.</p>

  <p>It was not easy for Zheng to cope with the following battles. After all, many people were paying close attention to him now. Just as Yilia had said, almost everyone had bought information about Zheng from Moore, so they were studying his skills as well as his strengths and weaknesses, and fighting him with corresponding methods and strategies.</p>

  <p>After defeating Yilia, Zheng obtained some points for his victory as well as an extra reward for his consecutive win. Now, he had accumulated 460, 000 points in total.</p>

  <p>"The anonymous man won again!"</p>

  <p>"He has defeated Yilia..."</p>

  <p>"He has moved up 20 places, but my rank is only 182nd. Thus, I have no chance to challenge him. Alas..."</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Arena of Legends, only warriors who were within a hundred places before and behind Zheng had the qualifications to challenge him. Now that Zheng's room had moved up 20 places, 20 people had lost the qualification to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Standing on a higher place, Nelly stared down at the anonymous man's room, her round eyes displaying a faint killing intent.</p>

  <p>Now that her sister had been defeated by Harold, there was even more pressure surmounting on the Mu Clan. The clans on the Floating Islands usually had more than one consummate True God. However, perhaps influenced by Rachelle's failure, the other consummate True Gods had also been defeated. This came as a great blow to the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Mu Clan's Floating Island ranked seventh. But if things continued to progress this way, the Mu Clan's rank would probably drop below the top ten.</p>

  <p>"That damn anonymous man! You better remember what you said!"</p>

  <p>Nelly was really afraid that the anonymous man wouldn't dare to challenge her. For the Mu Clan's sake, she had to get points from him.</p>

  <p>However, if he didn't want to accept her challenge, she wouldn't be able to do anything.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Liusu stared at the change in the anonymous man's ranking with an indifferent expression on her face. She had an intuition that the anonymous man was none other than Zheng. However, she couldn't take any action in the Hall of True Gods, so she couldn't test him.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the anonymous man had said that he would challenge her after defeating Nelly. Liusu was not as anxious as Nelly. She believed that the anonymous man would do what he had said.</p>

  <p>After Yilia was defeated by Zheng, she quickly left the Jade Wall of Legends and returned to the Floating Island of the Fang Clan.</p>

  <p>She didn't harbor any anger or resentment over her defeat, but her eyes were full of deep confusion.</p>

  <p>"You've come home so soon today?" a gentle voice asked.</p>

  <p>She turned to the familiar voice and faced her brother, Shahn— the most powerful consummate True God of the Fang Clan.</p>

  <p>"I just encountered something strange!" said Yilia.</p>

  <p>Curiosity flooded Shahn's eyes. Although Yilia was smart and lovely, she was too indifferent to things. There were few things that piqued her interest.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had even been unwilling to attend the Astronomical Transit Day held by the Sun Blind race. So for Yilia to have found something strange or interesting, it must have been monumental indeed. "What is it?" Shahn asked.</p>

  <p>"Can someone release power outside their body after the power is shaped and transformed into an object?" Yilia asked.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, Shahn gently patted the air, and an invisible palm print shot out. The palm print was so erratic that it finally hit the wall and disappeared. "It's not a difficult thing to do. Most of the True Gods who focus on cultivating the Might Godly Way can do it."</p>

  <p>Although Shahn hadn't cultivated the Might Godly Way much, he had condensed the Nine Divine Stars; he was just unable to put them into his inner world. Anyway, it wasn't difficult for him to hit the wall with a formidable strike like that.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, Yilia shook her head and said, "That's not what I mean. My opponent made use of Power Shaping to form a flying sword..."</p>

  <p>Before she could finish speaking, Shahn struck the wall again, but this time with an invisible sword which had been formed from the strength source. He shrugged his shoulders and said, "It's not difficult."</p>

  <p>"Can you let me finish?" Yilia glared at Shahn. Then, she continued,</p>

  <p>"After he detached the flying sword from his body, he managed to control it freely. Then, after I smashed it with my Parting Water Divine Mirror, he managed to shape it in the air again."</p>

  <p>At these words, a mixture of bewilderment and disbelief appeared on Shahn's face. He shook his head immediately and said, "That's impossible. The power can't be controlled freely after being shaped into an object. It would rapidly weaken. You might not have clearly seen what happened, or he might have used another kind of theurgy. It can't be the Power Shaping. As for the skill you just described, only a Holy Being can do it with the Cross-world Theurgy. Even I can't do that at my present level."</p>

  <p>"Really? Well, I thought I made a mistake. But he really did it..." Yilia uttered with a smile of admiration.</p>

  <p>"Who?" Shahn asked with confusion. In fact, although Yilia looked serious and utterly sure about her words, Shahn still doubted what she had said. Yilia's opponent was just a low-rank True God, so there was no way he could have been able to do that.</p>

  <p>"It was that anonymous man who challenged me today. And what I just described was the method he used to triumph over me," said Yilia.</p>
