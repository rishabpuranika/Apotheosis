<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was bound to be the core of the Dragon Lineage Human given that it was above the other three secret lands.</p>

  <p>These Soul Sea Realm warriors had never succeeded in obtaining the Ancestral Dragon Egg. Luo Zheng knew he would have to find another way to do so.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had to obtain the Spirit Supreme Realm girl's corpse.</p>

  <p>The other Soul Sea Realm warriors, especially War Emperor York, had gotten excited when he revealed his Black Star.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because they didn't want to obtain the young girl's corpse themselves.</p>

  <p>It was because they couldn't. No matter how hard they tried, none of them had ever been able to break her crystal coffin and the chains that bound her.</p>

  <p>Zheng's revelation of his Black Star filled them with excitement. To enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, it was better to choose stronger corpses and if Luo Zheng managed to break the crystal coffin, then they could also finally try to take over the young girl's corpse.</p>

  <p>But right now, they let Luo Zheng do his thing. Nobody was willing to compete with him against this.</p>

  <p>Surely, obtaining the Ancestral Dragon Egg would be a great achievement, but nobody was too stupid to stand in Zheng's way and risk offending him for this.</p>

  <p>Even War Emperor York, who originally had enmities with Luo Zheng, would not dare to compete and offend him now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the pickaxe out from his space ring as he approached the girl in the pillar.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms' plunder of the Feather Holy Sea had gifted them with the knowledge and understanding of each corpse's identity, all except for one. The young girl in the pillar was deeply mysterious and none of them knew anything about her origins.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help letting his wariness get to him. If the supposedly dead girl wasn't dead, then wouldn't they be in trouble if he let her out?</p>

  <p>His soul gently floated beside the stone pillar. The clear, crystal coffin gave him an undisturbed view of the girl that stood inside.</p>

  <p>She didn't wear a lot of clothes, and her skin was littered with nasty scars. Heavy, iron chains tightly bound both her hands and feet.</p>

  <p>Why was she tied up like this? Who was she?</p>

  <p>These questions lingered in his head as he sized her up. However, Luo Zheng knew he wouldn't really be able to find the answers by just standing there. He brandished the pickaxe in his hand and set to work in setting her free from her crystal coffin.</p>

  <p>Fighting with a pickaxe was less than ideal. There were more than thousands of techniques for swords, sabers, and spears, but none for pickaxes. However, as a supreme divine weapon, the Law of Causality contained within Zheng's pickaxe was very strong. That was the reason why he put a lot of trust in his pickaxe. Luo Zheng was even confident that it had the ability to dig through anything in the world.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's Jasper Fighting Soul Realm soul was incredibly strong; however, it could never compare to the strength of his physical body.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he didn't need to exert that much effort to use the pickaxe. With a simple strike, it was immediately able to smash against the crystal coffin and introduce a few cracks on the surface.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>It didn't even need a second strike. The moment the cracks appeared, they continued to spread along the surface until the crystal inevitably shattered and turned into fine dust.</p>

  <p>The entire coffin fell off the stone pillar but the girl remained bound by the iron chains.</p>

  <p>Astonishment filled Luo Zheng once the crystal coffin fell and the young girl's fragrance wafted over his nose. "There's even a faint fragrance? Is she still alive?"</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, Luo Zheng reached out and touched her chest.</p>

  <p>Plop. Plop. There was a heartbeat! And they were powerful.</p>

  <p>What stood before him was no corpse, but the physical body of a living person! To say he was shocked was an understatement.</p>

  <p>Although the young girl had been able to speak before, her voice was too mechanical for it to have come from an intelligent being, so nobody from the four divine kingdoms could discern if she was truly alive or not.</p>

  <p>However, the powerful heartbeats in her chest indicated that she was a living person!</p>

  <p>But the Dragon Lineage Human killed everyone for their blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>So why was there a living person here? Did she serve a purpose?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could guess that her soul had long since been obliterated, but her physical body was preserved by some kind of secret technique.</p>

  <p>If he was correct, then that meant it would be much simpler for him to possess her body. A living but soulless body meant that he wouldn't even need the Soul Core. An added bonus was that he would be able to exert his full power, meaning that it would be much stronger than the corpses controlled by the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>"Then let's begin." Without thinking too much about it, Luo Zheng swung his pickaxe and broke the chains that bound her. He gently pinched the young girl's cheek with a smile. "I'm sorry. I have to take over your body now."</p>

  <p>He put the pickaxe back in his space ring and immediately entered through the girl's mouth.</p>

  <p>His soul appeared within the girl's mind and the moment he realized where he was, his brow furrowed and he immediately put his guard up.</p>

  <p>It had been too easy, which meant that there was a catch and it was coming soon enough.</p>

  <p>The girl was much stronger than any of the corpses in the surrounding coffins. There was no way Luo Zheng would be able to easily occupy her mind without the slightest repulsive force. Something was up.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Why haven't I integrated with her?"</p>

  <p>The Soul Core should've helped Luo Zheng control this body, but in this girl's pitch-black mind, the Soul Core was rendered absolutely useless.</p>

  <p>It was all too strange and Luo Zheng felt his instincts scream at him to leave her mind quickly.</p>

  <p>"I have to leave!"</p>

  <p>It only took him six seconds to come to his decision; however, he was already doomed the moment he entered her body.</p>

  <p>A dignified voice spoke, "Since you're already here, you can't just leave like that?"</p>

  <p>"It's a trap," he murmured to himself. He was panicking earlier but now that he realized that there was nothing he could do to escape, he quickly calmed himself down.</p>

  <p>He figured that he should take things slow and easy and try to think of a logical solution to his current dilemma.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Zheng asked through his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Me? Didn't you stare at me too many times already? Don't you know who I am?" the girl asked, with a slightly offended tone to her voice.</p>

  <p>"You're not a dead person, so why are you sealed in this cemetery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Who said I wasn't dead? I have indeed died but I never expected someone to come after so many years just to occupy my body. Perhaps you want to accompany me?" the soul replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>"You're dead…" Luo Zheng repeated to himself in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>So she was a corpse with her own soul and undamaged body. But how could she be dead if her heartbeat was even stronger than Zheng's?</p>

  <p>"I can't really explain it to you clearly. However, since you're here, you should stay with me. Don't even try to escape!" the voice said once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly cupped his hands to show his sincerity. "Lady, I am so sorry that I unwittingly barged into your body. Please forgive me for offending you. Please be magnanimous…"</p>

  <p>The girl, however, cut him off, "What did you say? You 'unwittingly' barged in? Do you take me for a fool? I wasn't born yesterday, you know.</p>

  <p>You clearly wanted to take over my body. Do you think I will let you go?</p>

  <p>No way!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at her reply. Since she wasn't going to let him go, Luo Zheng willed his soul to speed away from her mind.</p>

  <p>However, it was in vain. The girl's soul seemed to be much more powerful than his. She merely snorted before red ripples suddenly appeared around the edges of her dark mind.</p>
