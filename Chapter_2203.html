<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the power poured out of him, the golden light in Luo Zheng's eyes also flickered.</p>

  <p>A magnificent, sharp, sword intent was condensed on the surface of the Great Weighty Sword...</p>

  <p>"Ripping Consciousness!"</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike! Slash!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The blazing sword intent almost cut off all of Luo Zheng's emotions and any thought within his mind. It hovered around and formed a sharp radiance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was all alone so he could freely activate the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, he did not release his sword intent. His only purpose was to cut these stalagmites.</p>

  <p>Despite being faded, the stalagmites were extremely tough. However, under Luo Zheng's physical prowess and the might of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, they were as crisp as paper.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion as the stalagmites all broke down.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Without the stalagmites restricting him, Luo Luo Zheng jumped up and headed straight towards the black mud, turning into a sharp sword as he did so.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The young man couldn't really figure out just what kind of strange life form this mud was but it was obvious that it created this cave as a trap.</p>

  <p>The mud continued squirming on the wall. The liquid it secreted strongly attracted the giant black shadows inside the walls as the more it let out, the faster the shadows moved.</p>

  <p>This "mud" probably thought Luo Luo Zheng would never be able to get out of its cage, so it maintained an extremely slow speed. However, after that loud explosion, the young man managed to free himself and attack!</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng rushing in at an extremely terrifying speed, the mud suddenly grew out five tentacles and reached into the gangue layer. Both the mud and the entire cave became one instantaneously. Transparent stalagmites began to spread from the mud, determined to cage Luo Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>However, the young man's current speed and strength were far beyond the mud's expectations.</p>

  <p>It hadn't taken Luo Luo Zheng that seriously. After all, it had already consumed quite a number of True Gods so what could a proving godly warrior do?</p>

  <p>It was the mud's mistake to judge Luo Luo Zheng so wrongly, however, it was too late.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites were not enough to obstruct Luo Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>As the young man entered the state of 'Ripping Consciousness', he not only could make full use of the power of his Emotion Closing Divine Dao but also stay calm despite the onslaught of threats that came at him.</p>

  <p>"Bang Bang Bang..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swung the Great Weighty Sword crazily, slashing away at any stalagmite that dared approach him.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Luo Luo Zheng had already slashed around a hundred stalagmites and was quickly heading towards that mud.</p>

  <p>"Sizz!"</p>

  <p>The mud let out a strange sound.</p>

  <p>As a last resort, the mud tore itself into pieces and hid into the wall behind it!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrow twitched. "It really can enter the gangue layer." He clearly saw the mud split itself into six pieces but the other five were just its tentacles. The one in the middle was the largest and had a bulge on the surface.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng slashed the Great Weighty Sword towards that prominent bulge.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the bulge was extremely tough. He couldn't break it even with the power of his Great Weighty Sword. Having escaped his blade, the bulge jumped out of the mud and scaled the walls of the cave, trying to get away from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, the bulge was actually a clean, transparent bead.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the bead was a slowly rotating pupil - it seemed to be the eyeball of some strange creature.</p>

  <p>The law of evolution made it so that the eyeball was the weakest spot of most creatures. This law didn't seem to apply to this creature since the eyeball was so tough.</p>

  <p>Although he was a bit surprised at this sudden turn of events, Luo Luo Zheng did not stop.</p>

  <p>The six pieces of mud left behind were now motionless and Luo Luo Zheng thought it best to put all pieces into his space ring. He also stretched out his left hand to grasp the eyeball.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's initial goal was to obtain that strange mud but the strange eyeball changed his priorities. Somehow, he felt that this thing had something to do with the Primal Chaos Technique which would explain his inner world's strong reaction towards it.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to grab it, a skinny, long arm suddenly popped out of the wall and made a grab for him. The shadows seemed to have finally penetrated through the wall!</p>

  <p>"This hand..."</p>

  <p>It wasn't organic. Rather, the hand seemed to be carved from some sort of special jade. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't feel any blood or energy from this arm so it was most probably a puppet.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Luo Zheng was going to let the eyeball escape!</p>

  <p>He clenched his teeth and hacked away the arm reaching for him.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Sparks flew in all directions...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had now entered the state of forgetting himself and unleashed 70% of the Gods-intimidating Strike. At that moment, even an ordinary True God would fear his blade, however, the jade arm remained intact and unharmed.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng's heart sank and his body suddenly floated. He gritted his teeth and increased his speed up by 30% which was almost his limit!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the effort paid off as he finally caught the elusive eyeball in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, watch out! There are hands around you..." Master Evil shouted in warning.</p>

  <p>Countless arms, stretching around ten feet long, all burst out from the walls and clawed in the air aimlessly. There were about six or seven arms reaching out towards Luo Luo Zheng from the wall that faced Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Knowing just how strong these arms were, Luo Luo Zheng figured that he would surely die if he got caught. Even if he exhausted his power and activated his entire strength source, it would still be difficult for him to break free.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>At such a critical moment, Luo Luo Zheng thought it best to use his bodily movement skill.</p>

  <p>These arms could only grab at the air blindly and didn't really know exactly where Luo Luo Zheng was. After employing the Eight Smoky Melodies, Luo Zheng's body became light as paper and avoided all the arms reaching for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng finally breathed a sigh of relief as he managed to escape the clutches of those arms. He deactivated the Eight Smoky Melodies and gasped for breath, his chest heaving as he did so.</p>

  <p>The sight of those densely packed arms made Luo Zheng's scalp tingle. The longer he stayed there, the more danger he was bound to face. He had to find an exit as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He went into the cave from the top but the tunnel he had created suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>He couldn't figure out the reason as to why this happened and he didn't have the time to think about it either. All he could do was to slash at the top of the cave with his sword in hopes of finding an exit.</p>

  <p>As the sword swung forward, a long, thin sword radiance directly tore open a huge crack on top of him. Luo Luo Zheng was about to rush out of the crack but the sight of what awaited him inside made him weak in the knees.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the crack was another huge cave and inside this cave were countless tiny pieces of mud which kept jumping around. Each mud had a bulge at the center where a pupil resided. These pupils currently stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If this cave contained only the mud Luo Luo Zheng needed, he would've been happy.</p>

  <p>Collecting those pieces of mud would help him condense his Godly Tile much faster. Unfortunately, along with these pieces of mud were seven or eight huge heads. These heads looked like skinless monsters that stared at Luo Luo Zheng menacingly.</p>

  <p>He felt his chest constrict as these eyes stared at him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng truly felt that he had been pushed into a dead end.</p>

  <p>He felt genuine fear that he would be unable to leave this strange cave, forever.</p>
