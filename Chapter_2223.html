<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After successfully passing Madam Moon's test, Luo Zheng was set free.</p>

  <p>The female disciples who had entered the Purple Soul Hall were all focused on cultivating the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way, in hopes to gain great achievement in terms of the Godly Way as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Up until now, Luo Zheng had been having difficulties improving his cultivation base. More so, the Purple Soul Hall didn't keep the disciples under strict control and thus, everyone present had enough spare time on their hands.</p>

  <p>Fortunately though, no one in the Purple Soul Hall had controlled Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These past few days, he swam around the Purple Soul Hall lazily, informing himself roughly about the disciples of the big clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>There were seven Jade Walls of Legends in the Purple Soul Hall, including the one in the Nameless Hall which Luo Zheng had entered before.</p>

  <p>Each one of them had their names on the Jade Walls of Legends and could enter the Arena of Legends in order to challenge the others. Every month, everyone had the obligation to challenge three opponents. If they left the Floating Island that month, they still had to complete three challenges in a very limited time frame after they returned. Everything would be recorded dutifully.</p>

  <p>For the most part though, the vast majority of True Gods were unwilling to challenge their opponents in the Arena of Legends. They were more willing to explore the forbidden lands and earn divine might coins through doing so.</p>

  <p>This was with reason, however. There were just too many masters in the Arena of Legends, and the opponents selected based on their points often had the same strength as theirs.</p>

  <p>If they were to be accidentally defeated, points would be deducted and it would be difficult to obtain the qualifications for entering certain forbidden lands. This explained why the Floating Island forced everyone to participate in a minimum of three battles.</p>

  <p>In addition to these kinds of information, Luo Zheng was also carefully collecting information about Murphy.</p>

  <p>The Mu Clan's Floating Island, which was led by Murphy, ranked seventh, more powerful than the Han Clan which ranked tenth. And the woman named Rachelle Mu was ranked third, at the top of all the Jade Walls of Legends. Her ranking was even higher than that of Harold, Augustus and Hallet.</p>

  <p>Harold was Zheng's father's chief disciple. And yet, the Luo Clan's Floating Island had been completely destroyed. Luo Zheng wondered how Harold had even managed to maintain his ranking.</p>

  <p>He was confused, but couldn't find the answer here in the Purple Soul Hall. That day, he simply decided to leave the Purple Soul Hall and head to the Han Clan's Holy Emperor City.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan's Floating Island was divided into three parts. The Purple Soul Hall was controlled by Joy, a Demi-holy Being. Aside from the Purple Soul Hall, the Holy Emperor City and the Spiritual Heart Hall were the other two parts that made up the Floating Island. The direct descendants of the Han Clan's Holy Emperor lived in the Spiritual Heart Hall, and no ordinary warrior had the permission to enter this place.</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor City was known as the location with the heaviest population throughout the entire Floating Island. Most of the disciples from the Han Clan and other clans were gathered in the Holy Emperor City.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Holy Emperor City, they had to go through the guards' inspection. Fortunately for him, Luo Zheng already had his own jade token.</p>

  <p>When the two guards saw Luo Zheng holding his jade token, they glanced at one another and then back at him. A trace of ridicule appeared on their faces. "A man from the Purple Soul Hall? How rare it is that we see any man from there..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng silently put his jade token away before entering the Holy Emperor City.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until he had actually entered the Holy Emperor City that he truly understood the amount of people there, as well as why the Han Clan disciples were envious of those in the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng stepped into the city gate, his view was instantly filled with various True Gods. There was noise everywhere. The city looked like a market crowded with mortals. The True Gods in the city all had fame and prestige, and could live forever. It was indeed hard for them to jostle with the crowds.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, a third-grade forbidden land will open, and we've specifically come in order to recruit twelve mid-rank True Gods who have two thousand points."</p>

  <p>"We equally need three low-rank True Gods who possess five hundred points each.</p>

  <p>Together, we'll enter the Demon Annihilating Forest..."</p>

  <p>On the square to Zheng's right, hundreds of True Gods were shouting loudly, inviting the other True Gods of the same level to explore the forbidden lands with them.</p>

  <p>And just like Luo Zheng already knew, a forbidden land was linked with points.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to enter a certain forbidden land, then one had to try their best to obtain the required number of points.</p>

  <p>"The Demon Annihilating Forest. Ha-ha..." In Zheng's mind, Master Evil revealed a look of envy. "It's so easy for these guys to enter the Demon Annihilating Forest. This world is just so unfair!"</p>

  <p>"What exactly is the Demon Annihilating Forest?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Master Evil replied with emotion, "It's a second-grade forbidden land, but it's very small. In the past, before the Demon Annihilating Forest was controlled by the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, many ordinary True Gods would enter it. In fact, even I was a regular visitor of it at the time. After a while though, even the Demon Annihilating Forest became occupied by the powerful clans. Alas..."</p>

  <p>"A second-grade forbidden land? How many forbidden lands of this kind can be found in the divine land, anyway?" Luo Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>In order to reply to Luo Zheng, Master Evil simply introduced the division of forbidden lands within the divine land.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Hall of Holy Beings had been established, it was in constant monopoly of the resources throughout the entire divine land, especially within the said forbidden lands.</p>
