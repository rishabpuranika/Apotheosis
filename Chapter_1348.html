<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1348 Unexpected News </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't even have time to examine the first-rank divine weapon in his hand before he heard the martial artists continuously denouncing the white-eyebrowed elder. The martial artists were not happy with what he did.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder was a high-ranking senior. However, now he was besieged by so many martial artists of the younger generation. Plus, he was in the wrong, so he didn't know what to say. Respect aside, he was supposed to apologize.</p>

  <p>"What, what are you talking about?" Luo Luo Zheng walked over with a light smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder realized that if he did not give an explanation, the juniors wouldn't let him go. He sighed and grudgingly said to Luo Luo Zheng, "I'm so sorry about what I did just now. It's not that I did not want you to obtain the sword; but, I was curious about your limits and thus, I controlled the light spot."</p>

  <p>"You finally admit it! You have indeed controlled the light spot!"</p>

  <p>"What a shame! The Weapon House might as well change its name to Dark Heart House!"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you anymore." The martial artists all roared at the elder in protest.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder had admitted his mistake, but the martial artists were still aggressive, making it hard for him to back down.</p>

  <p>Surely, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the blue light dot was being controlled by the white-eyebrowed elder. However, in the end, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the sword, and he even accepted the elder's excuse. Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand and said, "It's alright. It was just a little strenuous activity."</p>

  <p>If the white-eyebrowed elder had insisted on not letting him have the sword, then Luo Luo Zheng really might not have been able to obtain it.</p>

  <p>Since the elder had now made an apology, the martial artists who had a strong sense of justice quelled the anger in their hearts. Then, they looked at the first-rank divine weapon in Luo Zheng's hand with envy. It was a magnificent weapon, and they would all have relished having it.</p>

  <p>For the vast majority of martial artists, an ordinary first-rank divine weapon was even something that was far beyond their reach.</p>

  <p>The standard length of an ordinary long sword was three feet and three inches, but the Thunder Wind Divine Sword was five feet long. It was nearly fifty percent longer than an ordinary sword; this ensured a further reach during combat, making its wielder formidable.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, its blade was slightly wider than that of an ordinary sword.</p>

  <p>It was somewhat similar to a heavy sword, but the blade was extremely thin and therefore more lightweight. In a sustained battle, it would enable another advantage to the martial artist who possessed it.</p>

  <p>At a glance, the sword had two layers. The inner core was light blue, while the outer edge was golden red. The hilt was engraved with complex patterns. From its appearance, it more resembled an exquisite piece of art, than a weapon.</p>

  <p>As for its power?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't known that he was being tested here. This group of martial artists had helped him, so he didn't mind letting them admire his sword for a while longer. After a while, he placed the sword in his space ring and left the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>Rhydian stared at Luo Zheng's receding figure with his cold and looming eyes.</p>

  <p>The corner of his mouth curled up into a sneer. "You must possess as much strength as your weapon has. Although your talent is high, your strength is not enough to match that sword. I want to see just how many days that sword can stay in your hands!"</p>

  <p>In both the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House, countless talented martial artists had wanted to claim the three weapons left behind by the former palace leaders.</p>

  <p>However, it was too difficult to take these weapons by sheer force.</p>

  <p>Inadequate in their talent, they could only enjoy them by looking at them for now.</p>

  <p>Trying another strategy, the younger generation from influential families wanted to spend a large amount of life vitality jades buying the weapons from the Weapon House, but the Mist Palace had money to burn and wasn't interested in the exchange. They didn't care about life vitality jades. They wouldn't sell the weapons no matter how high the prices being offered were.</p>

  <p>As a result, these three weapons were left unclaimed in the Weapon House ever since. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had taken one of them away, he would certainly become a target for many people who wanted to take the blade from him.</p>

  <p>Rhydian intended to make a big fuss about this matter and fuel conflict for Luo Luo Zheng. He believed that there would be endless trouble for Luo Luo Zheng until he gave up on the sword.</p>

  <p>However, Rhydian didn't need to spread the news.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the news about a new comer taking away the Thunder Wind Divine Sword had spread like wildfire throughout the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the news had only travelled within the Ice Cloud House, because the martial artists who had witnessed Luo Luo Zheng claim the weapon were all from the Ice Cloud House.</p>

  <p>However, very quickly, the news was also sent to the Swallow Cloud House. The magnitude of Luo Zheng's accomplishment was hot news, and many martial artists were interested in it and awed by Luo Zheng's skill.</p>

  <p>"A new comer has really taken away the Thunder Wind Divine Sword?</p>

  <p>Did I hear that right?"</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable. I just happen to need a good sword now. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword should be perfect for me! I wonder if that man is good-natured."</p>

  <p>"I can offer as many life vitality jades as he wants to buy the sword!"</p>

  <p>There were many such conversations among the martial artists during the day. Of course, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea about any of it. After he left the Weapon House, he went to find Yolande.</p>

  <p>Compared to the sword in his hand, what Luo Luo Zheng cared about the most was Xun.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Weapon House, Luo Luo Zheng wandered around for a few minutes and was at a loss. He didn't seem to know where Yolande was.</p>

  <p>After some thought, he took out the jade slip Yolande had given him.</p>

  <p>The jade slip contained a map of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Of course Luo Luo Zheng knew how to read a map, but the problem was that the Mist Palace was huge, and Yolande's whereabouts was not marked on the map.</p>

  <p>"I might as well head for the center," Luo Luo Zheng mused curling his lips into an absent smile and walked straight to the center of the palace.</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was built on top of a huge pillar, and it took up a tremendous amount of space. As he travelled through the buildings, he soon arrived in front of a large hall.</p>

  <p>"It should be here." Luo Luo Zheng stopped at the door of a hall and confidently strode forward.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he stepped through the door, a strange power pushed him out before he could cross the threshold.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Curiosity appeared on Luo Zheng's face and he looked inquisitively at the doorway.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that a figure walked out from the hall. It was Timothy, the vice leader of the Mist Palace, whom Luo Luo Zheng had seen once before.</p>

  <p>Timothy coldly sized Luo Luo Zheng up and then berated him in a cold voice, "How can you barge into the True Mysterious Hall so recklessly? Do you lack a sense of propriety?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked indifferent at the vice leader as he said, "I'm looking for Yolande."</p>

  <p>Timothy's face froze slightly. He was quite baffled. Why did Luo Luo Zheng immediately call out Yolande's name?</p>

  <p>Due to their previous unhappy encounter on the steps of the front courtyard, Timothy didn't like Luo Luo Zheng at all. In fact he resented Luo Luo Zheng from the bottom of his heart. So Timothy coldly said, "Yolande isn't here. Leave quickly!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng politely nodded his head before withdrawing. At this moment, a figure drifted over from not far away. It was Yolande.</p>

  <p>At the sight of her, Luo Zheng's face broke into a handsome smile as he asked,</p>

  <p>"How is the thing going?"</p>

  <p>Obviously, he was asking about Xun.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled and nodded. She glanced at Timothy, who was now beside her, and asked, "I was wondering what kind of weapon you got from the Weapon House. Even Elder Yue has sent me a message because of you. Everybody seems excited about your luck."</p>

  <p>When Timothy, who was standing at the side, heard this, he said disdainfully, "A two-bit character uses a low-grade weapon, humph!"</p>

  <p>After he had finished speaking, he turned to step into the True Mysterious Hall. In his opinion, with Luo Zheng's cultivation level, he could at best have obtained a third-rank divine weapon. If he was lucky, he would have been able to claim a secondary second-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However, Timothy did not care about this at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and then took out the five-foot-long Thunder Wind Divine Sword from his space ring and said, "I've got this."</p>

  <p>The power contained within the Thunder Wind Divine Sword was astonishing. Even though Timothy had his back to Luo Luo Zheng and was going to enter the hall, he felt the sword light pierce his back. The weapon emanated power and awed all who were near it.</p>

  <p>Timothy was almost as strong as a world lord. Only extremely sharp divine weapons could make him feel this awe. Ordinary swords had no effect on him.</p>

  <p>He had already taken a step into the True Mysterious Hall, but now he looked over his shoulder and stared intently at the weapon in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>He was very familiar with the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>And he had even used it for a period of time many years ago.</p>

  <p>However, as the vice leader of the Mist Palace, he was only qualified to use it, and could not claim it for himself.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that Luo Luo Zheng would actually be able to take ownership of the sword. His face was filled with an expression of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Actually, he wasn't the only one who was surprised. Yolande's beautiful eyes were also filled with surprised awe. When Elder Yue had spoken to her via the message rune, she was doing her best to restore Xun's soul, so she didn't talk anything else with him. Originally, she had thought that Luo Luo Zheng had taken a secondary first-rank divine weapon, or an ordinary first-rank one.</p>

  <p>However, she had never thought that Luo Luo Zheng would actually be able to claim a former leader's Thunder Wind Divine Sword. She just couldn't believe it! Never, not even in her wildest dreams, had she considered Luo Luo Zheng to be that powerful.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but shake her head. From her memories, she recalled that Luo Luo Zheng had always been like this, always causing others to be surprised.</p>
