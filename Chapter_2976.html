  <p>
</p>

  <p>Maggie had retreated far away with her guards. Under the veil, her exquisite face revealed a hint of excitement.</p>

  <p>It had been a trap from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had seen through her little ruse at the last minute, it was too late; she had already achieved her goal.</p>

  <p>Once the Mist Summoning Spirit devoured Luo Zheng, she and her men would be rewarded handsomely.</p>

  <p>"There are many citizens in the Sweltering Desert, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his head and asked indifferently, even though the Mist Summoning Spirit was only a short distance away and he was in imminent danger.</p>

  <p>A look of surprise came over Maggie's face when she heard his question, but then she smiled sweetly and said, "Of course. It's how we live on. I'm sorry. You're a kind-hearted man."</p>

  <p>It was already tough for ordinary people to inhabit a barren desert. The existence of the powerful Mist Summoning Spirit only made it even harder for them.</p>

  <p>The Mist Summoning Spirit had an outstanding talent; it could arrange a magic space array and trap lost True Gods in it. However, it had a very obvious shortcoming: since it was a plant, it could barely move around.</p>

  <p>Some of the civilians living in this desert chose to cooperate with the Mist Summoning Spirit. They lured any True Gods who got lost in the desert to the Mist Summoning Spirit so that it could devour them. In return, the Mist Summoning Spirit would secrete some light green sap that could prolong the lives of the civilians and protect them from diseases.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the civilians made up lies to gain the trust of outsiders, and took them to the Mist Summoning Spirit.</p>

  <p>"You are humans. It's a shame for you to collude with a monster," Luo Zheng sneered, staring at Maggie.</p>

  <p>"Haha! A consummate True God! What good luck!" A strange sound came from the Mist Summoning Spirit's mouth, which was full of sharp teeth. It turned out that it could actually speak human language!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As soon as it finished its words, a thorn-covered vine shot out from its stem and rolled toward Luo Zheng on the desert sand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not dodge. Instead, he just let the vine wind around his body.</p>

  <p>"Shame? No. It's just a way to survive," Maggie said with a sly expression on her face.</p>

  <p>The guards around her laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Look at the prey sprouting rubbish from his mouth!"</p>

  <p>"Death is knocking at his door but he's still talking about shame. This is the first time I've seen such a stupid man! Haha!"</p>

  <p>"Maggie, I should get more of the Mist Summoning Spirit's sap like you promised me last time!"</p>

  <p>As they spoke, they all watched Luo Zheng being lifted up and dangled upside-down by the vine before being swung directly into the Mist Summoning Spirit's big mouth.</p>

  <p>The big mouth chomped on its prey, constantly chewing.</p>

  <p>The Mist Summoning Spirit was a plant, so it would take a long time to chew Luo Zheng into pieces before slowly digesting him.</p>

  <p>But after chewing for a while, the big mouth suddenly stopped. The other big mouths full of fangs also trembled and stopped in midair.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Maggie and her men frowned in confusion.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that young man taste good? Haha!" the guards teased.</p>

  <p>However, a trace of vigilance appeared in Maggie's eyes. She had been feeling uneasy ever since seeing the fearless look on Luo Zheng's face just now.</p>

  <p>The Mist Summoning Spirit that the people of the Sand Country spoke of was actually the Man-eating Demon Flower. After growing to such a level, it could easily devour True Gods.</p>

  <p>In fact, its magic array could even bewitch powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm. However, Maggie would usually let them go. It made it a point to never swallow up masters at the Other Shore Realm, because if it did, it would get hurt and everyone would suffer.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was just a consummate True God. By right, the Man-eating Demon Flower should have no problem devouring him.</p>

  <p>Just as Maggie was pondering over this with a worried look on her face, a tremendous force burst out from the mouth of the Man-eating Demon Flower.</p>

  <p>Then, Maggie saw the huge mouth suddenly swell up, as if something was trying to break out from it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The mouth suddenly exploded into pieces, revealing an unharmed and fully intact Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Luo Zheng's body grew to twice its size and continued to grow rapidly. A few moments later, he had become a giant over ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>After transforming into a Wild God, Luo Zheng grabbed the seven big mouths and the vines of the Man-eating Demon Flower and ripped them out of the ground, immediately destroying them.</p>

  <p>"It's only a part?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the torn roots before turning his head to look into the distance. Then, he reached deep under the desert sand and dug a huge hole.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the huge hole lay a strange plant with hands and feet. It looked just like a human. As Luo Zheng took a closer look, he could faintly see a scared face.</p>

  <p>"You are the true body of the Mist Summoning Spirit, right?" Luo Zheng sneered, his huge fist already shooting toward the bottom of the hole.</p>

  <p>"No, I-I am not. Please... I can give you..." the Man-eating Demon Flower begged for mercy, but before it could finish its words, Luo Zheng's fist made contact with its body, smashing it into fluid.</p>

  <p>The serous fluid gave off a faint fragrance that Luo Zheng had smelled before, when he had first met Maggie.</p>

  <p>After killing the Man-eating Demon Flower, Luo Zheng dissipated the Wild God Power in his body and returned to his normal size.</p>

  <p>Maggie and her men were all staring at Luo Zheng, their eyes full of fear.</p>

  <p>They had never witnessed the power of a Wild God before, so what Luo Zheng had just done was beyond their understanding. Even most of the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm had never heard of the ancient Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng smash the Man-eating Demon Flower with his fist like a giant god had left all of them dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Like I said, it's a shame to collude with a monster. What's more, you betrayed my trust," Luo Zheng said in a frigid voice.</p>

  <p>The guards finally came back to their senses and ran away, scattering in all directions. Maggie was the only one who stayed rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>With a nonchalant expression on his face, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand toward the guards. Lightning gathered at the tips of his fingers and shot out.</p>

  <p>It traveled several hundred feet before leaping onto the guards, instantly burning their bodies.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you running?" Luo Zheng asked, staring at Maggie.</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile, Maggie answered, "If you can kill the Mist Summoning Spirit that easily, I don't stand a chance. It's useless to run away from you."</p>

  <p>After all, they were only divine citizens. All this time, they had been able to trap and kill True Gods only with the help of the Mist Summoning Spirit.</p>

  <p>They had no strength of their own and were at the bottom of the Source World.</p>

  <p>"You are right,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said expressionlessly. Another beam of lightning shot out from the tips of his fingers and hit Maggie.</p>

  <p>The shock knocked the flute in her hand to the ground, and her hourglass body was immediately incinerated.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had revealed his Wild God Body to these people, he did not intend to leave any of them alive. Besides, they had all planned to kill him, so he took no mercy on them.</p>
