<br/><br/>

  <p>The group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors from the Celestial Position race had given Luo Luo Zheng quite a bit of time to stay in the Central Region. It was now time for him to leave.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie and Mu Ning weren't pleased with the news. They had only been with Luo Luo Zheng for less than two hours, then he had to leave so soon.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Ning Yudie knew that the group of super warriors in the Eight-diagram Wheel weren't particularly friendly towards Luo Luo Zheng, and now was not the time to protest. She could only hope for Luo Luo Zheng to return quickly to the Central Region after he finished what he had to do.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng felt that it would be inconvenient for him to bring Brianna on his trip to the Sea God Continent. Thus, he decided to leave her here for now and ask the people of the World Commercial Alliance to take care of her.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Dorothea was unhappy about it. The cyan dragon had told Luo Luo Zheng that although the Soul Sealing Spell was hard to remove, he did have some clues to the solution, and he didn't need help from the Celestial Position race. Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng didn't mind Dorothea's discontent. Besides, Brianna seemed to dislike her anyway.</p>

  <p>After Max had finished preparations, he waved his hand and etched a blood red cross-shaped rune in the Oracle City. After that, the Eight-diagram Wheel slowly rose up towards the sky, then headed towards the southeast direction as indicated by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng already had a specific outline of this world's map, thanks to the great world's memories. The land only occupied twenty percent of this great world's surface, and the remaining eighty percent belonged to the boundless ocean. On the west side of the world were several main continents, such as the Divine Kingdom Continent, the Central Region, among others. In addition, a massive piece of savage land lay in the north of the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>However, the Sea God Continent was an exception. It was isolated on the other side of the great world, which was why distinct cultures and customs flourished in it.</p>

  <p>A strong gust of wind blew against the Eight-diagram Wheel's sides.</p>

  <p>After the Eight-diagram Wheel had left the southeast area of the Central Region, it flew in a quick and steady speed in a straight line.</p>

  <p>Going to the Sea God Continent without traveling through a transmission array meant that they would have to cross nearly half of the great world.</p>

  <p>Such a thing was impossible to do in an instant, even for those Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng could enter the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb again and use the transmission array to directly travel to the Sea God Continent, he still hesitated to trust the seven people from the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to disturb Immortal Mist's slumber because of them.</p>

  <p>Blurry lines of blue clashed in the middle of the horizon. It was as if nothing existed between the heaven and the earth except for the dark blue sky, as they flew across the vast ocean.</p>

  <p>The Eight-diagram Wheel was enveloped in silence most of the time.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Ancestral Dragon's occasional whimpers, all the humans sat cross-legged in meditation. After Luo Luo Zheng had seen Brianna's inner world, he knew that all the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors had opened up their inner worlds. He guessed that everyone except him were operating the inner worlds within their bodies.</p>

  <p>Caw!</p>

  <p>The small dragon that was curled up beside Luo Luo Zheng suddenly cried out, with its large eyes fixated on him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng tilted his head and smiled at the little creature in return, he suddenly remembered that he still had to figure out how to deal with it.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon egg was originally a task the cyan dragon entrusted to him. But ever since it had hatched out, Luo Luo Zheng never had the time to properly think about how the small dragon should be settled.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon about it, he flatly replied, "Your imprint has already affected this small dragon. Removing it by force would harm the small dragon to some degree. It might be the reason these people from the Celestial Position race didn't snatch the dragon from your hands."</p>

  <p>But the main reason they didn't snatch the Ancestral Dragon was because they had recognized Luo Zheng's identity. At the same time, they knew that forcefully erasing the imprint would negatively affect the Ancestral Dragon. After they had confirmed the Tower of Crystal's location, they were most likely to bring Luo Luo Zheng to the Celestial Position race and employ him as the Ancestral Dragon's breeder.</p>

  <p>Of course, all of that depended on Luo Zheng's talent. If Luo Luo Zheng had really obtained the golden Celestial Position title like he said, then everything would be completely different.</p>

  <p>"Let's just wait and see what they will decide on. In my opinion, they will just let you raise the Ancestral Dragon as you please," the cyan dragon said and chuckled. He was quite clear that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't lied about anything. Someone so talented like him would always catch the higher-ups' attention. After his real talent was confirmed, the people of the Celestial Position would take care of him, and wouldn't dare offend him.</p>

  <p>"Let me raise the Ancestral Dragon?" Luo Zheng's eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Even from the very beginning, he had never intended nor thought about doing that. He only entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place to get the Ancestral Dragon egg at the cyan dragon's request. Now, Luo Luo Zheng felt that he couldn't be bothered to take care of the little creature.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Don't you wanna give it a try?" the cyan dragon calmly asked. "This kind of imprint between you and the dragon is even stronger than the contract between Fiona and the Genuine Phoenix. Moreover, this Ancestral Dragon has a far greater talent than a Genuine Phoenix. It could be your capable assistant after it grows up," he added.</p>

  <p>"But I don't know how to raise a dragon!" Of course, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the cyan dragon meant him no harm. Since the Ancestral Dragon was the faith of the entire Genuine Dragon race, it must have extraordinary talents and powers. The problem was, Luo Luo Zheng had never planned to raise a dragon.</p>

  <p>"The Ancestral Dragon has a very fast growth rate. It will mature soon enough so that you don't need to worry about it. Trust me, try your best to win it from the Celestial Position race," the cyan dragon said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel quite convinced. But when he glanced at the little furry fellow which curled up beside him in a deep sleep, he blinked and eventually nodded his head.</p>

  <p>For the first time ever, there was a trace of loneliness in the cyan dragon's eyes. When the red dragon noticed it, he tried to console his brother and said, "My brother, they are the first to be heartless. The race bond between them and us is already gone! Isn't it a wise choice for us to establish our own branch?"</p>

  <p>The red dragon had a quick and fiery temper, and wasn't as logical as the cyan dragon was. His younger brother shook his head and said, "After all, we came from the Genuine Dragon race. It's true that we can rely on the Ancestral Dragon to establish our own branch, but..." He stopped his words and sighed.</p>

  <p>Back then, there was a fierce dispute within the Genuine Dragon race, and nine Genuine Dragons had paid a huge price. Until now, only two of them had been awakened.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't come across Luo Luo Zheng, perhaps the old dispute and the mystery of the nine dragons would've drowned slowly into the river of history.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Luo Zheng grew stronger as time passed, the cyan dragon began to feel hope. If Luo Luo Zheng and the Ancestral dragon became powerful enough one day, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to rebuild their Heavenly Bodies and they could establish a new Genuine Dragon branch. Although the cyan dragon felt happy about this prospect, he was also reminded of their previous sorrows.</p>

  <p>The Eight-diagram Wheel traveled extremely fast, so it only took them a few hours to reach the Central Region from the Divine Kingdom Continent. However, it still took them a full two days to travel from the Central Region to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>They had encountered several huge fierce beasts along their way, such as an ocean beast with a twenty-thousand-feet-long body, and a giant bird with a wingspan of more than ten thousand feet, which made it look like a palace in the sky. However, these eleventh-level fierce beasts were aware of the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors on the Eight-diagram Wheel. They feared these warriors and thus, didn't dare provoke them.</p>

  <p>As for Dorothea and the other Celestial Position race warriors, they were not interested in those beasts at all. There were rarely things in the Lower World that could arouse their interest. Their goal of this trip was only the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>After two full days, a continent finally appeared before them. The Sea God Continent looked exactly as Luo Luo Zheng remembered it on the day he left.</p>

  <p>"Where in this continent is the Tower of Crystal?" Delroy asked indifferently. "It's in the center of this continent," Luo Luo Zheng turned to him and said.</p>

  <p>"Very well," a cold smile formed on Delroy's lips.</p>

  <p>"Let's go over there," he said to Hank.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "If you want to get close to the Tower of Crystal, I'm afraid it won't be as easy as you think..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Delroy asked with a frown. The rest of them frowned as well. Seeing was believing, as the saying went. Although Luo Luo Zheng looked serious, they still doubted his words unless they saw the Tower of Crystal themselves.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng answered seriously, "Because no warrior above the Virtual Tribulation Realm is allowed into the Cursed Land. Anyone who goes there will die."</p>
