  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little monster didn't seem too worried about Luo Luo Zheng absorbing his natural talent. For him, Luo Luo Zheng was not any greedier than the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm on the stairs!</p>

  <p>He had promised Marine to fight the battle, so he was not going to let Luo Luo Zheng leave this place alive.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of golden spears thrust out and instantly, the enchanted barrier was riddled with holes. The mighty Soul Sea Realm warrior could only repair the enchanted barrier again and again.</p>

  <p>This little monster's attacks were indeed aggressive. It looked as if he had firmly entrapped Luo Luo Zheng within the enchanted barrier. However, it was merely a way for the little monster to vent his anger as it didn't really cause Luo Luo Zheng much trouble.</p>

  <p>After a while, when the little monster felt he had done enough, a strange smile appeared on his face. "That's enough. Now it's time to send you to hell!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he moved and came in front of Luo Luo Zheng in a flash, closing the distance between them in almost an instant. He was now less than two feet from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and threw a punch towards the little monster. But the little monster raised his hand to block it!</p>

  <p>With such a simple gesture from the little monster, Luo Zheng's strength had vanished into thin air without a trace!</p>

  <p>This time, it was Luo Zheng's turn to be shocked!</p>

  <p>How was it possible?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had feared that he would get trapped by the little monster's flexible body. After all, he was a tricky creature to deal with. Therefore, he had activated the power of the eight hundred dragon scales when he threw the punch. Although it was not his maximum strength, he had used up about seventy to eighty percent of his strength!</p>

  <p>Even a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm couldn't block his attack, yet, this little monster had managed to do it.</p>

  <p>It was as if Luo Zheng's strike, weighing thousands of pounds, was thrown by a child; it did not move even one hair on the little monster.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a deafening explosion from a mountain near the West Dragon River.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>This mountain range, which was over ten thousand feet high, stood beside the West Dragon River. Together with a mountain on the other side of the river, these mountains formed a gorge called Hidden Dragon Gorge, which was also a relatively famous gorge within the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The huge mountain suddenly erupted with a mighty force. Following the explosive sound, the entire mountain range began to crack and collapse from the center. Huge rocks rolled down towards the West Dragon River, and massive waves crashed in the surging river.</p>

  <p>The large mountain suddenly collapsed.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? There is not a single soul on the West Dragon River, then how did that mountain suddenly collapse?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I was engrossed in the fight between Tianxing and the little monster just now. This Tianxing has innate superhuman strength. His strength is incredible, but this little monster easily countered his attack.</p>

  <p>It's unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"Is there a connection between these two things?"</p>

  <p>The audiences started discussing among themselves. They were getting more and more confused about this battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression was grave as he quickly withdrew his fist. He gritted his teeth, and his right hand once again accumulated an astonishing power.</p>

  <p>This time, he activated all the power of his dragon scales, while the forceful energy within his body erupted at the same time.</p>

  <p>All of his power flowed into Luo Zheng's fist. If this punch were to land on a powerful master of the Soul Sea Realm, it would kill him instantly!</p>

  <p>However, the little monster still didn't dodge. He once again stretched out his palm towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's fist landed on the little monster's palm, the little monster's body didn't move at all. At the same time, a deafening sound erupted from another mountain on the West Dragon River.</p>

  <p>Boom?</p>

  <p>The second mountain collapsed?</p>

  <p>The little monster grinned and said to Luo Luo Zheng, "Interesting, right?"</p>

  <p>''The power of my attack has been transferred, ' noted Luo Luo Zheng with a frown.</p>

  <p>The little monster chuckled and walked closer to Luo Luo Zheng. He wasn't afraid of Luo Luo Zheng in the least and his face was filled with arrogance. "To be honest, it's quite boring to watch you guys, who think yourselves extraordinarily gifted, jump around every day?"</p>

  <p>With that, the little monster turned his back towards Luo Luo Zheng. This time he faced the many warriors who had the divine-level talent and said, "You call yourselves divine-level talents, but it would take you several thousand years to advance to the Soul Sea Realm. How can you call yourselves talents? Your are only a pile of shit! Hahahahaha!" he laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>He continued mocking them, "Just now, this guy called Tianxing, no, actually Luo Luo Zheng, showed his extraordinary skills. How awesome is he! This sort of trash can actually intimidate the talents of your four divine kingdoms. One can only imagine how lame you all are! Hahaha!" The little monster continued to laugh maniacally.</p>

  <p>He had offended all the talents of the four divine kingdoms with his rude comments.</p>

  <p>However, the little monster didn't care. He didn't belong to any of the four divine kingdoms, nor did he belong to the Nine Furnace Martial House. As for the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm, he would kill them all in the future!</p>

  <p>War Emperor York and several other rulers were also irked. This little monster was very conceited and had a strange personality. If it hadn't been for the fact that they couldn't defeat Luo Luo Zheng themselves, they wouldn't have sent him to fight with Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>However, none of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm stepped forward to reprimand the little monster. They were counting on his innate magical energy to break through to higher levels. In the end, they had no choice but to let this mad freak mess around.</p>

  <p>'What the hell is going on?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a moment, Xun said, "This could also be an ability that the son of the plane possesses. My cultivation level hasn't reached the level of a world lord, so I was unable to command a great world. The world lords in the Upper World have shocking abilities."</p>

  <p>When a world lord controlled a great world, he was able to use it to help him bear the brunt of the damage. So when two world lords fought, they wouldn't suffer many injuries but the stars in their respective worlds exploded one by one.</p>

  <p>Hence, the battles between world lords were usually destructive. They could easily destroy thousands of stars.</p>

  <p>The little monster wasn't a world lord, but, as he was the son of the plane, he was the embodiment of the will of the great world, which was the reason why he had the ability to transfer the blows.</p>

  <p>"In other words, this fellow is truly an indestructible presence?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Not really. If you reach the Soul Sea Realm and your own domain is strong enough, then you can trap him within your domain and cut off his connection to the great world. Then he won't be able to do anything about it," Xun said flatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. He still had a long way to go before he could reach the Soul Sea Realm. But the problem was, what should he do now?</p>

  <p>The little monster had vented and mocked to his heart's content, but the divine-level talents of the four divine kingdoms all remained silent. No one jumped out to refute or challenge him. He immediately felt bored.</p>

  <p>What he really wanted was for these idiots to get enraged by his words and come to fight him. Then he would give them a brutal beating. He had planned to torture them both mentally and physically, but no one was taking the bait. The game had become a little boring now.</p>

  <p>The little monster turned to stare at Luo Luo Zheng with a mad look in his black eyes. "I forgot that the battle between you and me hasn't finished yet?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly distanced himself from the little monster.</p>

  <p>"Are you scared? It's too late," the little monster said with a menacing smile on his face. "Your talent is indeed much higher than those pigs. So I suppose you must taste better than them!"</p>

  <p>With that he suddenly pounced on Luo Luo Zheng, revealing his sharp teeth at the same time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was crippled with fear.</p>

  <p>If this fellow could truly divert his full power, then Luo Luo Zheng had no way of defeating him.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, he could indeed topple mountains and cut off the rivers with ease. But the great world was so vast. When Luo Zheng's power poured into the little monster's body, it would fully get transferred to the great world. And it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to destroy the entire universe. Even the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm couldn't achieve that, let alone Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Perhaps the person who took Yan away from the Ethereal Spirit Sect had the ability to achieve that.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng didn't attack again. He acted on conditioned reflex and retreated swiftly, instantly distancing himself from the little monster.</p>

  <p>However, in the limited space in the enchanted barrier, how could Luo Luo Zheng deflect the little monster's attack?</p>

  <p>Suddenly Turner said, "Luo Luo Zheng, our Harlen Divine Kingdom admits defeat!"</p>
