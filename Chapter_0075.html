<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 75 The State Of Completely Forgetting Oneself (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many outer disciples learned more by watching a battle and could take what they saw into their refinement process which allowed them to make breakthroughs of their own.</p>

  <p>Plus, with how mundane the daily practices were, a fight for revenge was in itself quite entertaining to watch.</p>

  <p>What made it more exciting was the considerable gap in the strengths between the two fighters competing with one at the organ refining level and the other half-step into the nature level!</p>

  <p>If Leo, half-step into the nature level, was comparable to a lion, then Luo Luo Zheng at the organ refining level was akin to a rat. They were not on the same level at all.</p>

  <p>Most people were certain that the competition would be finished fast and that it was a given that the outcome would be an overwhelming victory by Leo.</p>

  <p>Leo got to the battle ring early accompanied by his companions.</p>

  <p>Today there was also a middle-aged man with Leo.</p>

  <p>The clothing the middle-aged man wore denoted he was a servant. He was wearing a gray cloth and a bandanna on his head.</p>

  <p>When the outer disciples noticed the pattern with the Eight Diagrams* embroidered on his gray cloth, no one dared to look down upon him.</p>

  <p>(*TN: the Eight Diagrams were eight trigrams used to represent the fundamental principles of reality in?the Taoist beliefs, and seen as a range of eight interrelated concepts.)</p>

  <p>The emblem belonged to one of the seven top noble clans, the Zhuge family.</p>

  <p>The top seven noble clans were the most powerful and influential families in the entire empire. Although the middle-aged man was a servant, no outer disciple at the Cloud Sect could afford to offend him, since he was a servant of the Zhuge family.</p>

  <p>"My master said this man must die today, no matter what the cost is," emphasized the servant strongly. There was a condescending expression in his eyes as he glared at Leo. Even though Leo was half-step into the nature level, the servant showed the barest respect to Leo.</p>

  <p>A refiner who was half-step into the nature level was more or less a proud man; however, Leo, who was unhappy given the servant's attitude, tried not to show any expression. After all, his future depended on this servant's master. "I know." He nodded and replied with as even a tone as possible. "Don't worry. The intensity of attacks is uncontrolled in the battle ring. The cocky maggot is merely at the organ refining level, and yet, foolishly accepted my challenge! He is doomed to die!"</p>

  <p>Satisfied with Leo's response, the servant nodded. "Good! Don't you want to be promoted as an inner disciple? My master promises to assign you to the Blackrock Peak next month and advance you to the level as an inner disciple if you complete this task today!"</p>

  <p>Leo was thrilled to hear the news. "Many thanks to your master!" stated Leo giving a short bow as he hastened to express his gratitude.</p>

  <p>It was easy for members from noble clans to become inner disciples, but it was difficult for civilians like Leo.</p>

  <p>It had been five long years since he joined the Drizzle Peak, and in that time he had come a long way. Now, he was hell-bent on becoming an inner disciple.</p>

  <p>Throughout the thirty-three peaks, the treatment the inner disciples received differed vastly from how the outer disciples were treated. Inner disciples received the better elixirs for refining, along with various monthly payments and the places to practice their refining methods.</p>

  <p>To be initiated as an inner disciple of a Peak though, a disciple had to stand out from the tens of thousands of other outer disciples. While Leo was powerful and ranked thirtieth of the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak, every time he competed for a spot as an inner disciple, Leo fell short.</p>

  <p>After waiting for five long years, someone made Leo an offer to move him to the second-ranked Peak, Blackrock, and even better - Leo would be promoted to an inner disciple, just as his patience ran out, and all he had to do was to kill Luo Luo Zheng! It was too good a deal for Leo to pass up.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to not agree to the deal.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, since he only recently entered Drizzle Peak, Leo saw him as a stepping stone to a better future for himself and didn't give a damn about him.</p>

  <p>On the verge of realizing his dreams, Leo's face brightened with excitement.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Leo's thrill was turning to anxiety, and time was moving too slowly. 'That guy wouldn't back out after agreeing to fight me, would he?' he wondered starting to doubt Luo Luo Zheng was going to show.</p>

  <p>Because of Luo Zheng's tardiness, the other disciples standing around waiting started discussing whether he was going to show or not as well.</p>

  <p>Drizzle Peak had quite a few members, and the credibility of each disciple was essential. If Luo Luo Zheng were to back out, his credibility would be shot.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng apparently is wussing out! Shame, after all his big talk, he has cold feet. If this is the kind of person he is, Luo Luo Zheng definitely has no future!"</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's go. There's nothing to see here. We might as well spend our time refining while waiting. I knew our Drizzle Peak had another loser!"</p>

  <p>After waiting two hours, most of the spectators had lost patience and were about to leave.</p>

  <p>Having to wait so long for Luo Luo Zheng, Leo was restless and losing his already short temper.</p>

  <p>"Leo, you said Luo Luo Zheng was going to fight you today. Why isn't he here then?" demanded the Zhuge family man-servant.</p>

  <p>Leo smiled humbly and responded, "Don't worry, Thomas. That guy wouldn't dare back out!"</p>

  <p>Thomas Zhu sneered, "Good." His voice dripped sarcastically, "I hope you aren't wasting my time and that you don't fail the master."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dare do that!" as Leo spoke, he glanced Luo Luo Zheng out of the corner of his eye as he strode through the doorway and walked up to the battle.</p>
