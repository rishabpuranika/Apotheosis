  <p>
</p>

  <p>They retreated from the cave hurriedly and the Ear Mice soon followed.</p>

  <p>For these Ear Mice to be in the Sanskrit Light Stage meant they too were powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm. However, their terror as they fled was clear. Zheng realized the Ghost-claw Worms they spoke of should not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the Ear Mice escaped into the bone cavity, a dark black object suddenly came from behind them.</p>

  <p>It looked like a snake, but its front end split into three, like a three-fingered ghost claw!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The three fingers of the ghost claw suddenly stretched and slammed down heavily on the head of an Ear Mouse, its fingertips penetrating right into the poor creature's soul!</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse let out a series of desperate screams as it was dragged back into the bone cave. Its distressing squeak could be heard a long while before it finally stopped. This must have meant that the Ear Mouse had been dragged a great distance away!</p>

  <p>The other four Ear Mice could do nothing but watch helplessly as their companion was hauled away. Without missing a beat, they then escaped into another bone cave, swiftly moving on.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Libby followed the four Ear Mice into the bone cave.</p>

  <p>Behind them, many black Ghost-claw Worms were swarming over, chasing after them blisteringly fast, so fast it seemed as if they were flying!</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced back as he ran and saw that they were not flying but crawling along the walls of the cave.</p>

  <p>There were countless tiny feet on the limbs of the Ghost-claw Worms, similar to those of a centipede. Their feet moved fast and flowed like waves, advancing them along the wall at high speed!</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these Ghost-claw Worms? Their heads look like a ghost claw, but their bodies are worms..." Zheng asked sounding a little disgusted.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. According to the documents, these creatures come from the outside world," answered Libby while she kept running hard.</p>

  <p>"The outside world?" Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"These bone caves are not completely closed off. Some parts of the bone joints are broken and creatures from the forbidden area outside break in,"</p>

  <p>Libby revealed.</p>

  <p>The bone joints Zheng had observed were closed tightly, but apparently not all were this way. This gave the Other Shore creatures outside the bone caves a chance to invade.</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-nine and Stage Thirty-one were chocked full of dangers. The Element Spirit race couldn't establish a gathering spot on the two stages, which was why they attached great importance to the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The Ghost-claw Worms were fast and relentless, quickly closing the distance between them. If this continued, sooner or later they'd be devoured.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, take the first path on the left!"</p>

  <p>Libby shouted as they got close to the next bone cavity coming up ahead.</p>

  <p>She had never imagined they'd encounter such dangers when they had just entered the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>They rushed into the bone cavity and Zheng and Libby made a sharp turn, taking them into the first bone cave on the left. The Ear Mice, however, rushed into a cave in the middle.</p>

  <p>Then something unexpected happened. The black Ghost-claw Worms didn't follow behind them; they ignored them completely. They seemed focused on targeting the Ear Mice and only chasing them down as fiercely as they had been.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Zheng stopped at the entrance of the cave. "They seem to be set on the Ear Mice."</p>

  <p>"It's possible, but we still have to keep our guard up," said Libby vigilantly.</p>

  <p>The black slender bodies of the worms wriggled past in front of Zheng and Libby. Their bodies seemed to be infinitely long, long enough for them to hunt down and swallow every life form in the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the miserable screams of another Ear Mouse came from the next cave as it was dragged away horribly.</p>

  <p>"If we cut off their bodies, will they die?" Zheng asked, excited by his idea.</p>

  <p>It was very hard for a super force to have a Holy Soul Realm master, so it would be a great tragedy to lose a master at the said realm.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race had always been on good terms with Zheng so he didn't have the heart to see them die right before him.</p>

  <p>But Libby shook her head furiously at Zheng's suggestion, "No! Please don't do that!"</p>

  <p>Libby had much less experience than Elizabeth in dealing with crises. All she knew was the documents contained warnings to never provoke any living being in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Just like the Garudas in Stage Twenty-nine, they also lacked in power to combat the creatures in this stage.</p>

  <p>Similarly, she believed that the best course of action was to avoid the Ghost-claw Worms and so didn't want Zheng to meddle.</p>

  <p>She hoped the worms would simply leave after capturing all the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan. The remaining three Ear Mice fled along the bone caves, circling all the way around and coming out the other side of the cave Zheng and Libby were in!</p>

  <p>"Oh no!"</p>

  <p>Despair washed over the Ear Mice's faces as they saw the long bodies of the Ghost-claw Worms behind Zheng and Libby.</p>

  <p>The heads of the Ghost-claw Worms were hot on their heels, while their long bodies blocked the opposite end leading out. The cave they had escaped into had obviously turned out to be a dead end!</p>

  <p>"These guys..." Libby sighed, exasperated at the Ear Mice coming back at them.</p>

  <p>She had expected them to draw the Ghost-claw Worms away. Yet they brought disaster back their way and took her and Zheng back into the middle of a predicament.</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed cautiously at the ferocious heads of the worms and asked Libby,</p>

  <p>"Do you have any Other Shore weapons with you?"</p>

  <p>His physical body couldn't have a Sumeru space on the Other Shore, so all the weapons and treasures he had collected in Stage Fourteen were left in Elvinia's care.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Libby answered. She flicked her hand and a flash of blue light sparked from her Sumeru Space and a golden long sword appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>It was made of the sort of rare ores she had dug up in Stage Twenty-five, and it was one of her favorites.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the long sword from her and strode out of the bone cave!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the incredible power of the Civilization Artifact surged into his body, he slashed the sword forward. A beam of sword radiance containing tens of thousands of divine megatons of force gathered and shot out.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The bodies of the Ghost-claw Worms were sliced like a bundle of hemp rope and left an opening for them to escape through.</p>

  <p>The heads of the Ghost-claw Worms behind the Ear Mice all hissed in pain.</p>

  <p>Even when their bodies were cut, their heads remained alive and even quickened their speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not care what was happening behind him. He rushed forward with Libby, and the three Ear Mice followed closely behind them.</p>

  <p>"Human friend, thank you very much!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for saving our lives!"</p>

  <p>"My friend, you are on the Other Shore in your physical form. Are you  Zheng Luo from the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>When the Ear Mice saw Zheng offering his hand, they all made up their minds to follow closely behind him. In their eyes, he was the last life-saving straw they had. They were able to identify Zheng quickly by his special form, as it was famous on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"What the hell did you do to provoke these Ghost-claw Worms? Why do they keep chasing you like this?"</p>

  <p>Libby asked, annoyed and impatient, before Zheng could even answer their question.</p>

  <p>They had just reached the Sanskrit Light Stage and were now stuck being chased incessantly by these worms. It was all the Ear Mice's fault and she made her indignation obvious to them.</p>
