<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1984 The Rain Of Pain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Drip, drip, drip..."</p>

  <p>The repetitive pit-a-pat of the black raindrops on the ground filled the area.</p>

  <p>The Prison Island was located in a black sea, whose seawater was extremely corrosive. No living beings could survive in it.</p>

  <p>The seawater rose and evaporated until the water coagulated in the air and gathered above the Prison Island. Those water drops turned into the very raindrops that splattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night called such type of corrosive rain as the Rain of Pain.</p>

  <p>The seventh-generation Queen of Punishment had invented a new kind of artistic punishment upon her discovery of the place and the rain, which was second only to the Punishment of Eternal Night.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, Buzz."</p>

  <p>Two light chirping sounds were heard in the air before Fannie and Sammy, who both stood behind Luo Zheng, condensed a protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>The raindrops that fell on their protective life vitality hissed with sizzling sounds. It turned out that the Rain of Pain was corroding their protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>Even though they were world lords, they didn't dare make contact with the Rain of Pain. If such a level of corrosive rain could melt gold and pierce iron, it was also able to fully touch a martial artist's pain. Needless to say, the pain was immensely incomparable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was showered with the raindrops but didn't react at all.</p>

  <p>The water drops slid along his skin and did not corrode his body. The raindrops even seemed to be like ordinary water on him.</p>

  <p>When the two world lords of the Demon Night race saw the scene, confusion dawned on their faces.</p>

  <p>Just what was Zheng's physical body made of?</p>

  <p>The two world lords guarded the island. They even needed to protect their first-rank divine weapons from the Rain of Pain as well.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng didn't seem to be affected as he completely ignored the Rain of Pain!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A raindrop fell on Amber's body.</p>

  <p>Amber, who was originally suspended above the ground, suddenly trembled and groaned in pain.</p>

  <p>At the same time, numerous pained howls reverberated off the confines of the Prison Island.</p>

  <p>Prolonged exposure to agony could numb a person's sense of pain. Such was a martial artist's form of self-protection.</p>

  <p>On one hand, the huge pillars on the Prison Island actually contained the strong Life Law. Those pillars were made by the seventh generation Queen of Life and were actually trees of divine weapon level. Those trees were also prone to damage from the Rain of Pain, but they could use the Life Law to restore their own bodies and also the warriors who were tied to the pillars.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that the trees which were used to make the pillars were resistant to pain, while the martial artists who were tied to them suffered from it.</p>

  <p>"Ahh..."</p>

  <p>Black water droplets splashed against Amber's body. A few black holes scarred her usually snow-white back, and a faint white mist rose out of them.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the pillar released an immense amount of life energy and the holes on Amber's body were quickly healed. The newly patched up flesh in different colors became smoother.</p>

  <p>Yet at the same time her flesh had been repaired, more raindrops fell and the newly repaired flesh was corroded again, and then repaired once more.</p>

  <p>The cycle was endless, and it was also the most painful.</p>

  <p>The entire Prison Island was like a purgatory. Countless members of the Demon Night race all howled in various screams of pained cries and curses. Some of them, like Amber, managed to remain silent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked forward and with a light flick of his hand, he put an invisible force above Amber's head. The moment the raindrops splattered down, Zheng's invisible force repelled them.</p>

  <p>The Life Law inside the pillar then restored Amber's broken skin within ten seconds. Yet, her eyes had yet to open.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long when Amber finally felt something strange.</p>

  <p>As long as the pillar emitted life energy, the Rain of Pain wouldn't stop.</p>

  <p>The past few years were no exception.</p>

  <p>Amber stretched out a hand and brushed a strand of hair away from her face. Her eyes abruptly fluttered open, and in front of her was a handsome young man.</p>

  <p>Amber was slightly stunned as she stared openly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ever since they had parted ways in the Illusion Battlefield, Zheng's promise had been engraved in Amber's heart. It served as her greatest motivation to keep living.</p>

  <p>Every time someone's voice rang out through the universe by means of the Roaring Token, Amber had always listened carefully no matter how painful it was.</p>

  <p>Yet as time passed by and the situation progressed, Amber realized that things had only gotten more and more disadvantageous.</p>

  <p>While she might have not known much, she knew that there was a race called the Sacred race that had waged a war against the humans through the Roaring Token. She also found out that the Demon Night race and the Sacred race had formed an alliance, which made everything more complicated.</p>

  <p>Three years had quickly passed by, but Luo Zheng did not arrive at the scheduled time.</p>

  <p>Then again, Amber had never received any news about Zheng's death. She knew how Luo Zheng was and as long as he was alive, he would never give up.</p>

  <p>Just recently, Zheng's voice rang out once more. His message was a declaration of war against the Sacred race. In that case, he might not be able to save Amber and even after a few years, he still probably wouldn't be qualified to fight against the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>But Amber never expected to see Luo Zheng in only less than a month. She even suspected that she was dreaming.</p>

  <p>However, dreams did not exist in the Prison Island. Besides, no one could even sleep a wink in such painful conditions. Even if they were able to, it would only be full of nightmares.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you..."</p>

  <p>There was confusion in Amber's eyes, because behind Luo Zheng were the two world lords of the Demon Night race as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly at Amber with apologetic eyes. "I'm sorry. I'm late."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he gently tapped his finger.</p>

  <p>The vine which bound Amber tightly was instantly broken into pieces.</p>

  <p>Amber quickly fell down, her body lying limp on the ground.</p>

  <p>The many years of being eroded by the Rain of Pain had left her completely naked. Her cheeks bloomed red when she faced Luo Zheng and she struggled to keep her long legs together. At the same time, she stared at the two world lords behind Luo Zheng and croaked, "But they..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's sudden entry into the Prison Island should've warranted an arrest by the prison guards. However, there were two world lords with him right now who didn't seem to stop him at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng brought out a thick blanket from his space ring and draped it around Amber's body. "It's alright. They can't defeat me," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Amber lowered her head to stare at the ground. Even if they couldn't beat Luo Zheng, they shouldn't just watch her like that.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng's answer just made her even more perplexed.</p>

  <p>Of course, Amber did not know anything. It wasn't that those two world lords didn't want to stop Luo Zheng; but rather, Luo Zheng was far too powerful for them. Luo Zheng could kill them very easily.</p>

  <p>A battle against the two world lords would simply be a child's play for him. It didn't matter if they used all the means they had; Luo Zheng could still deal with them effortlessly. Therefore, why would they even bother?</p>

  <p>Now, they could only stand behind Luo Zheng and watch.</p>

  <p>Yao implemented extremely strict rules. All of the prisoners in the Prison Island were not allowed to escape. If Luo Zheng took Amber away, the two world lords would most likely receive severe punishments.</p>

  <p>All the elites of the Demon Night race were currently out for the battle.</p>

  <p>In any case, Yao didn't have the time and energy to manage the Prison Island for the time being.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had saved Amber, he turned around to face the two world lords of the Demon Night and asked, "Do you know why I didn't kill you?"</p>

  <p>In turn, the two world lords cautiously glanced at each other.</p>

  <p>They had seen the extent of Zheng's power. They clearly knew that it was indeed impossible for them to even compare to him!</p>

  <p>"Because I consider the Demon Night members as my friends," Luo Zheng surprisingly said with a smile.</p>

  <p>If the two Demon Night world lords had been surprised by Zheng's expression just moments ago, they were now completely flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>"Although the Demon Night betrayed the entire universe, the ones who betrayed the universe aren't you, but your queens." Zheng's voice gradually turned cold as he spoke, "The Demon Night doesn't only have two queens, and there is a third one..."</p>

  <p>Just then, traces of blood-red light glowed in Zheng's eyes together with a malicious Mu Ning. He suddenly seemed to inherit Xun's Mu Ning as he continued, "I will represent the Queen of Killings and eliminate the two other queens!"</p>

  <p>Amber, who was still wrapped in the blanket, looked at Zheng's broad back.</p>

  <p>Her face immediately lit up when she heard Zheng's words, followed by a gratified smile.</p>

  <p>As for the two world lords, they took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>In the past, any member of the Demon Night would undoubtedly punish any reckless person who dared to make such rude remarks to protect their queens' honor. They were even willing to sacrifice their own lives.</p>

  <p>Besides, those two world lords behind Luo Zheng belonged to the Saint Chain Sect, which supported the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>However, what Yao had done made the Demon Night a notorious race for betraying the entire universe.</p>
