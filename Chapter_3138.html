<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though nagging was against Trish's nature, she still felt frustrated that Zheng wouldn't give her any attention.</p>

  <p>After a few days, came the news about the restoration of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>As a result, Trish was in despair.</p>

  <p>The bell rang again, signaling the arrival of a new month.</p>

  <p>But this time, Zheng was indifferent and didn't pay much attention to it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how the Flow Sword Sect operated. So he just decided to seize the chance to cultivate by himself.</p>

  <p>He planned on perfecting the Sword Texture Technique and then heading back to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, as night struck, it was time for the assessment of the servant girls again.</p>

  <p>Like last time, Trish hung her head in defeat and went to the palace with the other girls.</p>

  <p>And just like before, she answered all her questions truthfully and then watched Zheng's bamboo slip get thrown into the 'Poor' pot.</p>

  <p>"The Flow Tower has been repaired. The disciples of the Flow Sword Sect will go in there for their training tomorrow. When your master fails, you can leave by yourself." The gorgeous woman spoke to Trish with a stern look.</p>

  <p>The other girls all looked at Trish with sympathetic eyes as she kept her gaze fixated on the ground in shame.</p>

  <p>To be expelled from the Flow Sword Sect was probably the most humiliating thing for these servant girls.</p>

  <p>After those events, Trish returned to the building with a defeated expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Studying her gloomy profile, Carrie understood what had happened, and she even mentally prepared herself to leave soon.</p>

  <p>"Tell Mr. Luo that the Flow Tower will be open tomorrow," Trish said with low spirits.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's better for you to tell him in person..." Carrie suggested while rubbing her shoulders to console her.</p>

  <p>"I... I don't want to talk to him!" Trish held Zheng responsible for all the humiliation she had to face.</p>

  <p>Blinded by anger, Trish refused to interact with him. Understanding her predicament, Carrie sighed helplessly and went upstairs to pass the message to Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>"Flow Tower..."</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng didn't expect things to continue like this forever.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't be giving out those entry tokens for nothing.</p>

  <p>However, he still wondered why the Flow Sword Sect would operate like this.</p>

  <p>On the next day, Trish was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>"Please follow me." Carrie bowed slightly towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Trish was so depressed that she chose to not come out that day, so Carrie had to take over and escort him instead.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed Carrie out of the door. As if on cue, the other doors opened one after the other as well.</p>

  <p>The servant girls continued to lead their respective disciples of the Flow Sword Sect through the alleys.</p>

  <p>These disciples were all highly cultivated, with most of them having reached the sixth stage of the Other Shore Realm. They gave Zheng occasional sideways glances that were filled with contempt.</p>

  <p>As they headed towards the Sword Tower, the servant girls immediately recognized Carrie in the crowd. They connected the dots and concluded that Zheng was the master entrusted to her and Trish. Upon seeing her with him, most of them began to silently whisper to their young masters.</p>

  <p>"That guy is  Zheng Luo, he has been rated as Poor for two months in a row!"</p>

  <p>"In the past, when someone was rated as Poor, they would get expelled after the assessment in the Flow Tower next day. This time with the Flow Tower damaged, he's been rated as Poor for two months consecutively without getting dismissed. It has never happened before."</p>

  <p>"What a shame, Trish is still going to be expelled despite her efforts."</p>

  <p>Although the servant girls only whispered among themselves, Zheng still could make out what they were saying.</p>

  <p>He didn't care much about the taunts directed towards him, but he turned to ask Carrie with a concerned tone, "Are you getting into trouble because of me?"</p>

  <p>Carrie was tempted to nod so bad, but she controlled her emotions and shook her head. "No, it's your choice, we cannot interfere with it."</p>

  <p>Sensing her unspoken feelings, Zheng nodded to himself and gave her a confident smile. "I won't let you down."</p>

  <p>'Yes, you will...' She wanted to refute his claims, but instead, kept it in her heart.</p>

  <p>Following the swarm of people, they had passed through many palaces and buildings. After the long stroll, a tall tower filled Zheng's field of vision as it mounted over him.</p>

  <p>The tower's shape resembled that of a gourd, except it had 19 floors. And on each floor, there was a door leading inside it.</p>

  <p>The tower was surrounded by a dozen buildings, the buildings looked similar to the one he spent his days in. But he had no idea who lived in them.</p>

  <p>As Zheng shortened the distance between himself and the Flow Tower, he began to sense something strange coming from it.</p>

  <p>His mind refused to allow his body to move any further until he had determined what that was. The anxiety and restlessness flooded his thoughts.</p>

  <p>In hopes that others had felt the same thing he did, he began to scan the expressions of the other disciples. But, they seemed unbothered and didn't appear to have observed a thing.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's baffled reaction to the tower, Carrie sighed deeply within.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Flow Sword Sect were able to come up the mountain, which meant that they were all highly cultivated.</p>

  <p>The side-effects of the extreme feelings triggered by the Flow Tower were very dreadful.</p>

  <p>Before entering the tower, one had to release all their desires and obsessions.</p>

  <p>Greed, wrath, lust, pleasure, pride, envy, gluttony...</p>

  <p>One should rid themselves of every passion, and it was consequential for them to satisfy all their desires before they could think of entering the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Of course, not all desires could be satisfied...</p>

  <p>For example, some people wished to obtain a premium Other Shore Treasure, but they simply couldn't because they lacked divine crystals. That type of desire wouldn't be satisfied. Everyone knew that the Flow Sword Sect would never really offer them any premium Other Shore Treasure. It was unrealistic, to begin with.</p>

  <p>A building to cultivate and two servant girls were all that they could arrange.</p>

  <p>Practicing great self-control and suppressing inner inhibitions was a unique form of cultivation required by the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>When the disciples gathered, Zheng scanned their faces as if to look for someone.</p>

  <p>He was searching for Milo.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew Milo was in the Flow Sword Sect, and that sooner or later he would come face to face with him.</p>

  <p>But as hard as he looked, he couldn't see him anywhere.</p>

  <p>For some reason, he still glanced around and desperately yearned to see his face.</p>

  <p>In the past, he wouldn't feel so uneasy over encountering him, even though he cared a lot about confronting Milo.</p>

  <p>After searching unsuccessfully for a while, Zheng finally realized he was under the influence of the tower!</p>

  <p>'I must have underestimated the tower, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As time passed by, about a dozen more disciples gathered outside the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>The gorgeous woman waved her hand, and a row of golden lot pots emerged in front of her. "Every disciple of our sect will be given ten entry tokens every year. That gives everyone twenty hours in the tower each year.</p>

  <p>You can tell that every chance to enter the tower is extremely precious. I hope that you make the best use of it!"</p>

  <p>"For those newcomers entering the tower today, anyone who can't make it through the second floor will be expelled immediately. The entry tokens will be divided by others. Anyone who could reach the seventh floor will be offered another building and an extra hundred entry tokens every year."</p>

  <p>She was obviously referring to people in a similar position as Zheng.</p>

  <p>As she explained the rules, it became clear that the buildings surrounding the tower were for the use of the elite disciples.</p>

  <p>She finished speaking and drew a bamboo slip from the golden pot labeled as Excellent. "Damien Zhu, you may proceed into the tower."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, a young man with light-colored skin stretched himself and casually walked towards the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Then, she went on to draw another slip from the same pot and announced the name. The one who got called went inside the tower as well.</p>

  <p>One after the other, she sent ten people in, and then she stopped drawing the slips.</p>
