<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4152 Battle Of Attrition </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Keep moving,"</p>

  <p>Gianni barked, after having dealt with the Snow Birds.</p>

  <p>Every round of attacks required all human spirits to die in battle.</p>

  <p>However, this time, all the human spirits stopped in their tracks.</p>

  <p>The three human spirits that were just killed would have their coordinates erased.</p>

  <p>It was said that seven more were to suffer the same fate.</p>

  <p>"General Gianni, all of us will die in a round of attack," Alphonse said with a hint of anxiety in his tone. "Do you mean the coordinates of ten people will definitely be erased after every round of attacks?"</p>

  <p>"General Gianni, we are all human spirits," Hamilton pitched in. "How could you be so cruel?"</p>

  <p>Both Alphonse and Hamilton were leaders of their respective houses, and were far stronger than ordinary human spirits. It was unlikely they were going to die first.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the three houses were of the same sect and race.</p>

  <p>They tended to look out for each other. When Gianni treated their lives like trash, they felt indignant yet helpless.</p>

  <p>Gianni stared at Alphonse with mock. "If you think ten is too many, then sacrifice yourselves. Once we reach the quota of ten, the remaining people will be safe."</p>

  <p>All the human spirits who overheard this felt anger stir in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Even the several human spirits of the Broad House that followed Gianni were furious. One of them, a burly man, cursed loudly. "Gianni! It was stupid of me to follow you this whole time!"</p>

  <p>"General Gianni, as a general of the Ten Directions House, you are so ruthless..."</p>

  <p>"General Gianni, go to hell..."</p>

  <p>The human spirits began to curse him, one after another.</p>

  <p>As Gianni heard these offensive and harsh reproaches, his disposition remained unchanged. With a bored expression, he said, "The monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City have all been executed. Is that what you want?"</p>

  <p>The sole reason why the Snake Masters allowed the three houses to exist was because they still found them useful. The second they lost their value, the Snake Masters would exterminate them swiftly and mercilessly.</p>

  <p>A hush fell over the crowd. Exchanging nervous glances, no one dared utter another curse.</p>

  <p>Naturally, no one wanted to die here, in this small pond. Only by living on could they possibly see light at the other end of the tunnel.</p>

  <p>Through gritted teeth, Alphonse said, "Warriors of the three houses, charge!"</p>

  <p>Then, taking the lead, he rushed forth into the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Shooting each other helpless glances, the other human spirits had no choice but to follow suit.</p>

  <p>Gianni watched the people rush into the bird nests with a grim expression.</p>

  <p>Just then, a small snake-shaped mark appeared on Gianni's shoulder. From the mark, a voice rang out, "Gianni, you did a good job."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your praise, Master Balfour," Gianni replied. Any trace of regret was wiped from his face and was instantly replaced with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Take down the nest in the far right, and our Snake Spirit Sect will reward you generously," Balfour said. "When we return to the main world in the future, you will be in charge of the Human Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters, snake spirits and all the other Treacherous Beings were extremely dissatisfied while trapped in this small chaos.</p>

  <p>They had all hoped that one day they would return to the main world.</p>

  <p>Even the Snake Spirit King promised that if they were able to come back, the Four Spirits Sect would be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect would be the ruling force, and the other three sects would probably serve as vassals.</p>

  <p>However, the status of Human Spirit King was still good, despite being a vassal. "Master Balfour," Gianni said, practically beaming, "you are so kind. I will do my best!"</p>

  <p>Then, the snake-shaped mark dimmed gradually, until it completely disappeared from his skin.</p>

  <p>From a hundred miles away, Balfour, leader of the Cyan Snake Department, sneered arrogantly, "When the Bird Spirit Sect is taken down, you will no longer be of any use to me. You want to return to the main world? And become the Human Spirit King? What a ridiculous dream..."</p>

  <p>Creating a divide amongst the Four Spirits Sect was no easy task for the Snake Spirit King. Why on earth would he want to rebuild it upon returning to the main world?</p>

  <p>Yes, it was true that they planned that the Four Spirits Sect would still exist once they returned, but the Snake Spirit King would be their sole ruler.</p>

  <p>After muttering to himself for a while, Balfour then turned to his soldiers.</p>

  <p>"The rate of those damned birds' revival is slowing down," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Let's take the nests in this round! Charge!"</p>

  <p>The Cyan Snakes, which were currently coiled before Balfour, had all been quivering with excitement. They were one of the main forces of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>As soon as Balfour gave the order, the snake spirits dashed towards the nests, their forked tongues slipping in and out of their narrow lips excitedly.</p>

  <p>The nests built by the Bird Spirit Sect were a natural fortress. From the outside, they looked like a haphazard mess. From the inside, however, the structure was incredibly unique.</p>

  <p>The bird spirits could spread their wings and fly with ease inside these nests, but any enemy that attacked from outside would've troubles navigating, being blocked layer by layer. Thanks to the nests' unique structure, the Bird Spirit Sect were able to block the Snake Spirit Sect's attacks until this point.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Upon entering one of the nests, Balfour moved quickly yet quietly, like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Two rows of sharp blades stuck out from the sides of his body, making him resemble a centipede. This was his fighting form.</p>

  <p>The second a shadow of a bird spirit entered his cone of vision, he'd lunge forward.</p>

  <p>Without having the time to even cry out, bird spirits would be cut to pieces by the sharp blades.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Balfour had felled countless bird spirits when a huge figure emerged from one of the nests. The figure stretched out a pair of sharp claws and swiftly grabbed at Balfour. However, Balfour saw it coming and turned his body slightly, and the blades on the sides of his body clashed with the incoming sharp talons.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang...</p>

  <p>As dozens of blades collided with the sharp claws, the sound of clashing metal echoed throughout the bird nest.</p>

  <p>Balfour retreated a few feet till he found a pillar he could coil around.</p>

  <p>Climbing up the pillar, his beady eyes finally caught a full view of the figure that had just attacked him. "Duran, long time no see. How have you been?"</p>

  <p>The giant bird glared at him. He was Duran, the second strongest Bird Master of the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>With a snort, Duran narrowed his eyes at Balfour. "You're going to die soon, I'm afraid this reunion will be cut short."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he spread his wings and launched himself towards Balfour. In the blink of an eye, he closed the distance between him and Balfour, talons poised to strike.</p>

  <p>Balfour immediately raised his coiled body, coming to meet Duran like a spiral blade.</p>

  <p>However, Duran was much faster than Balfour. He moved like lightning, flashing here and there and striking Balfour swiftly. Each time Duran swooped in, he left deep claw marks on Balfour's back, head, and tail.</p>

  <p>Additionally, there were also Holy Stones embedded in Duran's sharp claws. The Light of Annihilation penetrated through the claw marks into Balfour's body, destroying his body little by little.</p>

  <p>Seeing he was at a disadvantage, Balfour tried to get out of this tricky situation.</p>

  <p>He flew upwards, trying to make his way around the complex bird nest, simultaneously trying to dodge Duran's attacks.</p>

  <p>But obviously, Duran knew the bird nest better than Balfour. No matter where Balfour went, Duran followed.</p>

  <p>Balfour had nowhere to hide. He desperately rushed to the top of the nest and knocked open a big hole in its roof, flying into the open sky.</p>

  <p>However, just as he had flown a thousand feet, Duran swiftly closed the distance. A pair of sharp claws wrapped around the snake's body firmly, despite the blades sticking out of Balfour's body. Unable to fight back, Balfour could do nothing but watch helplessly as Duran dragged him back to the nest.</p>
