<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The illusory space created by Othniel looked as though it was made up of countless huge spaces.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the illusory space extended infinitely. If one looked from afar, even Othniel's massive body looked minuscule compared to the vastness of the space.</p>

  <p>"That guy is brave. He went straight in, no hesitation." Othniel's voice echoed throughout the illusory space.</p>

  <p>"If I didn't come on my own volition, you'd have dragged me in," the Evil God said calmly.</p>

  <p>"It's good that you know that," Othniel smiled, shooting the Evil God an amused glance. "I'm sure you can tell what the outcome of this battle will be. Why not surrender now?"</p>

  <p>"The outcome of this battle?" the Evil God echoed, eyebrows shooting up angrily. His tone suddenly grew serious. "The only outcome I can see is of you being torn to pieces."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan, Divine Farmer, and Othniel all burst into laughter, as though they'd just heard the funniest joke in the world.</p>

  <p>Othniel continued, "This is an illusory space. There's no way you'll come close to even hurting me here. I appreciate your courage, though. Beg for mercy now, and I'll grant you a swift death!"</p>

  <p>"Illusory space?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God raised his hand and closed his eyes to feel the space around him.</p>

  <p>He sensed that the rules which kept the space running were completely independent.</p>

  <p>"It's true that you have created this independent illusory space, but this space is still within the Source World..." the Evil God suddenly said, opening his eyes to shoot Othniel a mischievous glance.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Othniel, visibly confused.</p>

  <p>"Can you bear the external pressure?" the Evil God asked and smiled menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the whole Source World shook.</p>

  <p>Then, it shrank slightly...</p>

  <p>While the Source World only shrank by a minuscule fraction, under the Evil God's control, it seemed to affect the illusory space on a large scale.</p>

  <p>In other words, the illusory space was compressed by the Source World!</p>

  <p>"Crackle..."</p>

  <p>As the external pressure hounded on the illusory space, the seemingly infinite background that once looked like a giant net suddenly began to crack.</p>

  <p>"Othniel, what's happening?" Xuanyuan asked as he worriedly eyed the cracks forming all over the space.</p>

  <p>In terms of the use of the space token, no one in the entire chaos could surpass Othniel. Now that the illusory space had actually been broken, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer were quite confused.</p>

  <p>"What did you do!? Why is there such a strong pressure?" Othniel couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you want more pressure?" The Evil God's eyes flashed crazily and he grinned like a madman. "I can deliver!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely.</p>

  <p>Truly, it was quite pleasurable, seeing these arrogant warriors' confused expressions.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The cracks climbed all over the illusory space at a rapid pace. It was only a matter of time before the entire space collapsed.</p>

  <p>The Evil God laughed as he thought of an apt metaphor. 'It's like a fragile egg that's constantly being knocked over!'</p>

  <p>As more and more cracks appeared, the illusory space lost its invisibility and suddenly appeared above the Blood Sea Province. However, everything was in a different hue!</p>

  <p>"Evil God!"</p>

  <p>"Darling!"</p>

  <p>Through the cracks, Shera and Edna could observe what was happening within the space.</p>

  <p>Othniel growled in rage as he struggled to keep the illusory space together. "Xuanyuan, kill him immediately!"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan's expression darkened. Gently patting the side of his waist, he summoned a fierce-looking sword. Simultaneously, the bloodline power within him was activated.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>As the bloodline surged excitedly, a holy way appeared and enveloped Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>His bloodline lay in the power of the holy ways.</p>

  <p>He had learned how to use his bloodline all by himself, so he had always been under the impression that he had reached the full potential of the power of the holy ways.</p>

  <p>However, only after he came into contact with the Blood-controlling Method did he realize that he had been so naive. His use of the bloodline had been too superficial!</p>

  <p>"Let me show you what the real holy ways are!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Holy Ways!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Ten huge holy ways appeared and enveloped Xuanyuan. The aura contained within these holy ways was several times more terrifying than before!</p>

  <p>At the end of each holy way, there was a statue of an emperor, and each statue was different. As the ways intersected with each other, a unique and mysterious aura flooded out.</p>

  <p>From outside the battle, the former captain of the Black Ship froze when he saw Xuanyuan's Emperor Holy Ways. He hadn't found the Grandmaster of Heaven after he entered the Other shore, so he had hurriedly retreated to the Source World, only to stumble upon this heated battle. "I can't believe Xuanyuan has cultivated the holy ways to such a level..."</p>

  <p>Before, the former captain could've sworn that he could face Xuanyuan in a fight, and that it'd likely end in a draw.</p>

  <p>However, seeing the current Xuanyuan before him, he was sure he didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God said that he had practiced some Blood-controlling Method, but I never imagined it would increase his bloodline power to such an extent!" Shera exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Even as the Evil God watched the Emperor Holy Ways shooting towards him, his expression remained unchanged.</p>

  <p>Calmly raising his hand, he vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>A moment later, he appeared at the edge of the space.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can escape?" Othniel's voice boomed.</p>

  <p>Then, two footprints floated in the space where the Evil God stood moments earlier. They were exactly Evil God's footprints.</p>

  <p>Just as Othniel finished speaking, the Evil God was drawn back, right on top of the footprints.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The Emperor Holy Ways, which were mixed with numerous sword shadows, all shot towards their target.</p>

  <p>It was like a heavy rain of sword shadows pouring towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled, his eyes glistening with the reflection of the Emperor Holy Ways closing in on him. "That's your plan? To fix me in a place and then kill me?" The Evil God smiled even wider. "Pathetic."</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God's expression grew serious. Suddenly, the Ways-blending Energy began to pour out from his body, turning into colorful little snakes that shot upwards.</p>

  <p>Whenever a sword shadow collided with a little snake, a terrifying energy vortex would be produced after a violent explosion.</p>

  <p>Just as the Emperor Holy Ways were about to strike down the Evil God's head, hundreds of energy vortexes appeared above him.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>All the energy vortexes rushed up at the same time and collided into the ten Emperor Holy Ways.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom</p>

  <p>Countless explosions rang throughout the illusory space.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Holy Ways, which had initially seemed so terrifyingly powerful, all shattered as they collided with the energy vortexes!</p>

  <p>"Your so-called power of the holy ways is still too weak," the Evil God sneered. "Even if you have cultivated the Blood-controlling Method, you still can't defeat me."</p>

  <p>Hearing what the Evil God said, Xuanyuan frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>His bloodline was indeed not that strong, something he realized when he battled with Fuxi in the past. Although the power of the holy ways was intimidating, it was quite fragile and easy to break. This was one of the reasons why he had been depressed.</p>

  <p>However, that was in the past, not now.</p>

  <p>Now that he had obtained more incredible theurgies through the Blood-controlling Method, he felt confident his bloodline was stronger than that of any of the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?</p>

  <p>Maybe it was true in the past, but not now!</p>

  <p>Let me show you the complete power of the holy ways!"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan grinned fiercely and pointed his sword towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>A slender blood line, as thin as thread, suddenly enveloped the Evil God.</p>

  <p>More blood lines appeared and these blood lines formed indistinguishable paths.</p>

  <p>Through the cultivation of the Blood-controlling Method, Xuanyuan had gained much insight.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God was busying himself in destroying the territory of the Bearing race, Xuanyuan had seized this opportunity to cultivate the Blood-Controlling Method. This was why the Evil God met no obstacles on his journey to the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>A powerful holy way didn't necessarily have a physical form.</p>

  <p>All the kinds of holy ways that the Xuanyuan had cultivated before were visible and had form.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful Emperor Holy Ways still belonged to the visible ways.</p>

  <p>However, Xuanyuan later discovered that the strongest holy way was actually invisible.</p>

  <p>"Life and Death Holy Way!"</p>

  <p>This time, no holy way could be seen. Only a few, barely visible lines faintly glowed in the space.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Those thin lines instantly shot towards the Evil God like possessed silk threads.</p>

  <p>The second the threads of holy ways touched the Evil God, he felt his body tremble slightly, then he collapsed. All the life force in his eyes faded away, and his smirk was immediately wiped from his face.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who enters my Life and Death Holy Way are bound to meet their doom there. Feel free to take your time before you finish your journey..."</p>

  <p>A pitiful look flashed in Xuanyuan's eyes as he said this.</p>

  <p> </p>
