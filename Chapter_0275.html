<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The journey of two meters downwards beneath the surface of the lake had cost Luo Zheng quite a lot of time, but once there, Luo Zheng dived deeply and shook the fish tail quickly, and his body swam forwards much like an arrow had been shot through the water.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, he was approaching the fifty-meter mark in terms of depth.</p>

  <p>As soon as he reached 50 meters, three more yellow dots appeared not far away from him. They were mere twinkles but became bigger very quickly. Once he could see them clearly, he narrowed his eyes, "Three Murlocs."</p>

  <p>Even while facing just one Murloc in the lake, Luo Zheng had been in a difficult position a while ago. He had done nothing but run away passively.</p>

  <p>So it was surprising to see that on seeing three Murlocs, he didn't choose to run away. On the contrary, he shook the fish tail attached to his back and rushed towards the trio.</p>

  <p>The three yellow Murlocs saw him approach and quickly formed a defense pattern in the shape of a triangle, with one in front and two at the back. They had black spears in their hands, and the sharp spear-point showered the water around them with a cold light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rushed forward, but just as he approached the Murloc in front, he suddenly twisted his body, which made the fish tail at his back slap around crazily.</p>

  <p>With the full propulsive force of the tail behind him, Luo Zheng turned around and avoided the spear that the Murloc had thrown at him with rather alarming force. At the same time, he turned around once more and gripped the Murloc's huge head.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Murloc heads were naturally the hardest parts on their bodies, but once Luo Zheng had fixed his hands, he could make full use of his peerlessly powerful strength.</p>

  <p>He tore the fish head with enough strength to split it.</p>

  <p>After the head was torn, the Murloc surely died. In no time, he turned into a ball of colorful light and disappeared in the water...</p>

  <p>To be clear, the Murlocs in the Lake of Magical Fish were holographic projections of the magic array around the lake, and weren't real. The only indigenous species in the area were some red daces.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had killed the first Murloc, the other two waved their black spears from different positions, trying to spike Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was reacting much more quickly than them. The only problem was that earlier, he wasn't used to this water. But now, he had mastered how to swim in the heavy water, and it was no problem for him to dodge two simple spears. As he tore the head of the first Murloc, the tail at the back of his body waved around, and he floated upward rapidly.</p>

  <p>The resultant change in position afforded him the ability to avoid the spears at the same time as going on the offensive.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he spun a complete hundred and eighty degrees in the water, turned his head down, and stretched out his hand to grasp the two spears before the two Murlocs took them back.</p>

  <p>Grabbing them hard, he pushed back with all his resolve and in an instant, the sharp spear ends had cut through the Murloc shells.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng couldn't hear any sound around him in the water, he clearly saw that the two Murlocs spread some colorful lights and then disappeared right in front of him... .</p>

  <p>Outside the Lake of the Magical Fish, Roger and the guard were sitting on a stone bench and waiting quietly for Luo Zheng to leave the lake.</p>

  <p>Roger had originally planned something else for the day, but once he saw Luo Zheng entering inside, he had postponed his engagement.</p>

  <p>When in Dragon Fort in the south, Luo Zheng had shown astonishing strength.</p>

  <p>At that time, he hadn't entered the nature level or become a nature creature, but the strength he had shown was enough to impress Roger.</p>

  <p>Now they had been apart for many days, and Roger wanted to see what level Luo Zheng had been promoted to.</p>

  <p>"This bloke didn't listen to my advice. The Lake of the Magical Fish is a magic array, but even so, the pressure under water is high since we use heavy water. If he can't control himself properly, he will get injured."</p>

  <p>The guard shook his head and stared at an array plate sitting beside him at the stone bench.</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of arrays, such as magic array, killing array, maze array, impasse array and so on.</p>

  <p>Each kind of array had a different purpose. For example, the magic array was set to cultivate and test. It was the most convenient one for the cause and had the best results.</p>

  <p>All the magic arrays had a common point, and there was an array plate to control and monitor the operation of the huge array.</p>

  <p>For example, when Luo Zheng had taken the Blooded Test on Bloody Mountain, Joshua was in control of the magic array used to release the ogre which had chased Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The magic array plate beside the guard had the same effect. It could not only control the magical Murlocs in it but also monitor where the human in the magic array was.</p>

  <p>"Gee, Luo Zheng has met the first Murloc, and it is chasing him now," The steward stared at the array plate and said.</p>

  <p>Roger also moved close and looked at the array plate. It showed that a little yellow dot was approaching Luo Zheng quickly.</p>

  <p>Roger had just climbed up from the Lake of the Magical Fish and was clear that the Murlocs in the lake were hard to deal with. When he had been here for the first time, he had received the family elders' directions and experience about how to resist those Murlocs. And he had taken a water-avoiding pill.</p>

  <p>The pill was supposed to make a small life vitality film around the body.</p>

  <p>After Roger had taken it, he was able to upgrade his moving speed in the water by almost 50%.</p>

  <p>Even after being so well prepared, he had been at a disadvantage when he had met the first Murloc.</p>

  <p>After dodging several times, he had been spiked by the Murloc and then forcefully sent by the magic array out of the water...</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is not a disciple from a noble clan. He seems not to know well about the Lake of the Magical Fish. It is a rash decision to venture downwards so early. I think he will probably be killed by the Murloc and sent to the water surface." Even if Roger tried his best to overestimate Luo Zheng, he didn't believe that Luo Zheng could avoid the Murloc's attack as soon as he entered the lake.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a genius, but mere genius wasn't equal to anything.</p>

  <p>But boy! Soon after the small yellow dot had approached Luo Zheng, it slid off.</p>

  <p>"This bloke is lucky. The first attack of the Murloc didn't hurt him," the steward laughed. He had been a steward of the lake for many years and had seen all kinds of situations.</p>

  <p>Roger also nodded, "I agree that he was lucky, but he must be in a flurry now. I think it will be difficult for him to avoid it once again."</p>

  <p>As soon as Roger finished speaking, they saw the small yellow dot rushing towards Luo Zheng again, and again they saw him avoiding the attack.</p>

  <p>Then it showed on the array plate that Luo Zheng had started moving rapidly, with the small yellow dot giving chase. At last, it fell back unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had left it behind.</p>

  <p>"Heehee! This bloke seems to be blessed with abnormally good luck!"</p>

  <p>The steward laughed.</p>

  <p>Roger didn't reply and kept on staring at the array plate.</p>

  <p>They could see that Luo Zheng wasn't moving but floating around in a daze.</p>

  <p>"What is he thinking about? Doesn't he dare to dive lower?" The steward looked at the array plate and wrinkled his brows. Anyone who cared about what others thought of him would dive inside the lake and find a hidden place to wait around till the end of the time. That way, people wouldn't think that he or she couldn't survive for long in the lake.</p>

  <p>After all, for some disciples from the noble clans, pride was more important than the point in Cloud Sect and the cubic crystal.</p>

  <p>But Roger shook his head, "Luo Zheng is not a disciple from a noble clan, and he won't do that."</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng wouldn't do that. The entirely unrealistic idea of pride had nothing to do with him. What was more, although he had enough money at hands with thousands of cubic crystals, he didn't want to waste them. It made his heart ache to spend 200 points in two hours. How could he waste time here?</p>

  <p>This array plate could only fix Zheng's position, but they couldn't see what was going on inside. The red daces group was not created by the magic array, and the array plate couldn't monitor them. So Roger and the steward didn't know that Luo Zheng had come to a stand-still to get used to the heavy water and figure out a solution.</p>

  <p>When he finally started to move again, the array plate showed that he was at a tremendous pace.</p>

  <p>"This, this..." The steward opened his eyes wide and looked at his velocity inside the lake, unable to speak out of astonishment.</p>

  <p>Roger was also shocked when he saw the same, even though he had stayed out of curiosity and the hope that Luo Zheng would do something beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>And Zheng's velocity in the heavy water was actually far beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>It was tremendous.</p>

  <p>Even Roger couldn't reach this speed now, let alone when he had entered heavy water for the first time.</p>

  <p>The small dot that represented Luo Zheng on the array plate moved at a high speed and then approached the three yellow dots. In no time, the three disappeared in the magic array plate...</p>

  <p>Roger and the steward saw that but kept silent.</p>

  <p>Till now, the hand just moved half a scale on the clock sitting near them.</p>

  <p>Just one hour had passed...</p>

  <p>"Has this bloke been here before?" The steward stayed silent for a long while and finally asked.</p>
