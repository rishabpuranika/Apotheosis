  <p>
</p>

  <p>Elvinia had always been a cold woman. So Zheng was not used to her current tenderness and affection. That was not who she was.</p>

  <p>However, at the sight of her exquisite face so close to his, Zheng felt his heart racing. She could easily crush any other woman in the Oneness Sky Palace with her radiant beauty. Save one— only Dorothy's lovely visage could hold a candle to hers.</p>

  <p>Zheng said with a smile, "You must have made a mistake." He then gently pushed Elvinia away.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Elvinia's eyes were filled with confusion. She rummaged through her memories and found another clue among her random fragments of recollection.</p>

  <p>A trace of anger suddenly appeared in her eyes. "How dare you intrude into my place!"</p>

  <p>"What? Your place?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng froze for a moment. As quick as a flash, Elvinia shoved her palm into his chest. He had no time to stop her.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Living creatures of the Dark Region were extremely powerful. Even the pig-faced monsters and human-monkey monsters were far stronger than other creatures living outside, not to mention the black monkeys and the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>The body of a purified being was refined in a special way. Even though it had just been formed, it still contained terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Elvinia's light slap contained far more than a thousand divine megatons of force. Zheng felt his chest collapse and he was sent flying nearly a mile away.</p>

  <p>"Ahem!"</p>

  <p>Slowly, painfully, Zheng got to his feet, and promptly coughed up two mouthfuls of blood.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with Elvinia? She was gentle and sweet a minute ago, but then she hit me?</p>

  <p>There was some serious power in that blow. I think she really intended to kill me!'</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng get up from the ground, Elvinia suddenly raised her eyebrows in dissatisfaction. She tapped the tip of her toe on the ground and flew straight up into the air. Like the lithest acrobat, she made a perfect arc in midair, and swooped down towards Zheng, feet first.</p>

  <p>If she hit him this time, she would probably stomp him into the ground!</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Zheng rolled sideways and dodged her attack in a rather awkward posture.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Elvinia hit the ground like a meteor, and created a huge crater hundreds of feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>Since she missed, she suddenly twisted her body and tried to grab Zheng. She acted so quickly that Zheng had no time to dodge. He helplessly watched her grab his neck.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no doubt that even if she used a fraction of her strength, she'd crush his neck and his head would fall from his body. The purified being was terrifying!</p>

  <p>"Anyone who dares to break into my holy tomb must die!" Elvinia shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Zheng raised his hands in surrender.</p>

  <p>"Wait for what?" Elvinia asked.</p>

  <p>After listening to what Elvinia had just said, Zheng finally figured out what was going on.</p>

  <p>He found that not only did she have Elvinia's memories, she also had those of the white shadow, Master Teague of the pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>Teague's memories were quite different. In them, Zheng trespassed, walking into the holy tomb to disturb his purification and reincarnation. So he would surely want to kill him. Under the influence of this memory, Elvinia tried to kill Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>"You've got it all wrong again. Search your memories," Zheng immediately said.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake again?" Elvinia was at a loss again. Her grip was tight around Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>Zheng said helplessly, "Yes, think hard. Who am I?"</p>

  <p>She saw his sincere look— he wasn't lying to her. Elvinia began to plumb the depths of her soul, hoping to unearth another clue. Soon after, her expression changed completely, and her look was one of love and affection.</p>

  <p>She released Zheng's neck and pulled him into her arms. She whispered, "I remember! You are Zheng, the one I love!"</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng decided that silence was golden.</p>

  <p>He survived the octopuses and the pig-faced monsters and even withstood the bloody bites of the Regal Jade Bugs in the black pool. But now he was at Elvinia's mercy. If she killed him, that would not be good. That was not what he wanted at all!</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. I'm the one you love," Zheng chimed in.</p>

  <p>What he wanted to do now was to calm Elvinia down and take her away from here. It would be better if he could escape the Dark Region and leave the Other Shore with her!</p>

  <p>There were many talented people in the Oneness Sky Palace. Someone there could fix the chaos in her soul, and give her access to the right memories.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me?" Elvinia asked, blinking her eyes in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," Zheng answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Elvinia displayed an innocent and childish smile. She carefully sized up Zheng, closed her eyes and said, "Then kiss me!"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>Zheng was dumbfounded by her sudden request.</p>

  <p>Even if they were in a relationship, the Dark Region was no place for a kiss, or anything else for that matter. And Elvinia's newly formed body had a very pungent smell of blood, which was off-putting.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a bit with her lips pursed, Elvinia opened her eyes again and gave Zheng a puzzled look. "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was afraid that Teague's memory might come back to haunt her again.</p>

  <p>He didn't need that to happen. If he kissed her, that might help. His close brush with death still fresh in his mind, he brought his lips close to hers.</p>

  <p>Finally, he kissed her soft lips.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Dark Region expanded very slowly in Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>For several thousand years, the Dark Region had only occupied a fifth of the area of Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>But the Dark region was growing. The past few years had seen it expand more rapidly than it had before.</p>

  <p>A tremendous untapped vein of Burning Crystal was discovered in Stage Thirteen, which attracted the attention of the more powerful races.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Three black monkeys bounded through the mountains.</p>

  <p>They were man-sized, as opposed to the ten-foot tall giant monkeys.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were covered with palm-sized yellow pieces of paper, which emulated the appearance of armor, even if it were made of paper.</p>

  <p>Each piece of yellow paper had runes inscribed upon it. As they jumped from rock to tree making their way up the mountain, the yellow paper flapped in the wind, making all kinds of racket.</p>

  <p>These black monkeys were far stronger and faster than the rest of their brethren. That's why they were chosen for this mission.</p>

  <p>Before long, they ascended the mountain. As they looked down from the peak, they were all shocked.</p>

  <p>From their vantage point at the top of the mountain, they could see a circular area. Everything in this area had disappeared. No trees, no rocks, nothing. It looked something had exploded, and taken everything with it.</p>

  <p>"Is that... Is that the power of the light?"</p>

  <p>"A purified being is stronger than that."</p>

  <p>"That's frightening! If the Blood Assembly gets their grubby paws on it. I'm afraid we can't keep the vein."</p>

  <p>The two black monkeys grew gloomy.</p>

  <p>The black monkey standing at the end of the line said in confusion, "The pig-faced monsters lived here, right? If that purified being is Teague, he wouldn't kill every member of his race and ruin their land. Something's wrong."</p>
