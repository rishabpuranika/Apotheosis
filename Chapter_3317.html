  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had always been a cold woman. So Luo Zheng was not used to her current tenderness and affection. That was not who she was.</p>

  <p>However, at the sight of her exquisite face so close to his, Luo Zheng felt his heart racing. She could easily crush any other woman in the Taiyi Heaven Palace with her radiant beauty. Save one? only Dorothy's lovely visage could hold a candle to hers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a smile, "You must have made a mistake." He then gently pushed Feng Ge away.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes were filled with confusion. She rummaged through her memories and found another clue among her random fragments of recollection.</p>

  <p>A trace of anger suddenly appeared in her eyes. "How dare you intrude into my place!"</p>

  <p>"What? Your place?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng froze for a moment. As quick as a flash, Feng Ge shoved her palm into his chest. He had no time to stop her.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Living creatures of the Dark Region were extremely powerful. Even the pig-faced monsters and human-monkey monsters were far stronger than other creatures living outside, not to mention the black monkeys and the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>The body of a purified being was refined in a special way. Even though it had just been formed, it still contained terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's light slap contained far more than a thousand divine megatons of force. Luo Zheng felt his chest collapse and he was sent flying nearly a mile away.</p>

  <p>"Ahem!"</p>

  <p>Slowly, painfully, Luo Zheng got to his feet, and promptly coughed up two mouthfuls of blood.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with Feng Ge? She was gentle and sweet a minute ago, but then she hit me?</p>

  <p>There was some serious power in that blow. I think she really intended to kill me!'</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng get up from the ground, Feng Ge suddenly raised her eyebrows in dissatisfaction. She tapped the tip of her toe on the ground and flew straight up into the air. Like the lithest acrobat, she made a perfect arc in midair, and swooped down towards Luo Zheng, feet first.</p>

  <p>If she hit him this time, she would probably stomp him into the ground!</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Luo Zheng rolled sideways and dodged her attack in a rather awkward posture.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge hit the ground like a meteor, and created a huge crater hundreds of feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>Since she missed, she suddenly twisted her body and tried to grab Luo Zheng. She acted so quickly that Luo Zheng had no time to dodge. He helplessly watched her grab his neck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no doubt that even if she used a fraction of her strength, she'd crush his neck and his head would fall from his body. The purified being was terrifying!</p>

  <p>"Anyone who dares to break into my holy tomb must die!" Feng Ge shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Luo Zheng raised his hands in surrender.</p>

  <p>"Wait for what?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>After listening to what Feng Ge had just said, Luo Zheng finally figured out what was going on.</p>

  <p>He found that not only did she have Feng Ge's memories, she also had those of the white shadow, Master Teague of the pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>Teague's memories were quite different. In them, Luo Zheng trespassed, walking into the holy tomb to disturb his purification and reincarnation. So he would surely want to kill him. Under the influence of this memory, Feng Ge tried to kill Luo Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>"You've got it all wrong again. Search your memories," Luo Zheng immediately said.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake again?" Feng Ge was at a loss again. Her grip was tight around Luo Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said helplessly, "Yes, think hard. Who am I?"</p>

  <p>She saw his sincere look? he wasn't lying to her. Feng Ge began to plumb the depths of her soul, hoping to unearth another clue. Soon after, her expression changed completely, and her look was one of love and affection.</p>

  <p>She released Luo Zheng's neck and pulled him into her arms. She whispered, "I remember! You are Luo Zheng, the one I love!"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng decided that silence was golden.</p>

  <p>He survived the octopuses and the pig-faced monsters and even withstood the bloody bites of the Regal Jade Bugs in the black pool. But now he was at Feng Ge's mercy. If she killed him, that would not be good. That was not what he wanted at all!</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. I'm the one you love," Luo Zheng chimed in.</p>

  <p>What he wanted to do now was to calm Feng Ge down and take her away from here. It would be better if he could escape the Dark Region and leave the Other Shore with her!</p>

  <p>There were many talented people in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Someone there could fix the chaos in her soul, and give her access to the right memories.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me?" Feng Ge asked, blinking her eyes in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," Luo Zheng answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Feng Ge displayed an innocent and childish smile. She carefully sized up Luo Zheng, closed her eyes and said, "Then kiss me!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was dumbfounded by her sudden request.</p>

  <p>Even if they were in a relationship, the Dark Region was no place for a kiss, or anything else for that matter. And Feng Ge's newly formed body had a very pungent smell of blood, which was off-putting.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a bit with her lips pursed, Feng Ge opened her eyes again and gave Luo Zheng a puzzled look. "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was afraid that Teague's memory might come back to haunt her again.</p>

  <p>He didn't need that to happen. If he kissed her, that might help. His close brush with death still fresh in his mind, he brought his lips close to hers.</p>

  <p>Finally, he kissed her soft lips.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Dark Region expanded very slowly in Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>For several thousand years, the Dark Region had only occupied a fifth of the area of Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>But the Dark region was growing. The past few years had seen it expand more rapidly than it had before.</p>

  <p>A tremendous untapped vein of Burning Crystal was discovered in Stage Thirteen, which attracted the attention of the more powerful races.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Three black monkeys bounded through the mountains.</p>

  <p>They were man-sized, as opposed to the ten-foot tall giant monkeys.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were covered with palm-sized yellow pieces of paper, which emulated the appearance of armor, even if it were made of paper.</p>

  <p>Each piece of yellow paper had runes inscribed upon it. As they jumped from rock to tree making their way up the mountain, the yellow paper flapped in the wind, making all kinds of racket.</p>

  <p>These black monkeys were far stronger and faster than the rest of their brethren. That's why they were chosen for this mission.</p>

  <p>Before long, they ascended the mountain. As they looked down from the peak, they were all shocked.</p>

  <p>From their vantage point at the top of the mountain, they could see a circular area. Everything in this area had disappeared. No trees, no rocks, nothing. It looked something had exploded, and taken everything with it.</p>

  <p>"Is that... Is that the power of the light?"</p>

  <p>"A purified being is stronger than that."</p>

  <p>"That's frightening! If the Blood Assembly gets their grubby paws on it. I'm afraid we can't keep the vein."</p>

  <p>The two black monkeys grew gloomy.</p>

  <p>The black monkey standing at the end of the line said in confusion, "The pig-faced monsters lived here, right? If that purified being is Teague, he wouldn't kill every member of his race and ruin their land. Something's wrong."</p>
