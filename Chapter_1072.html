<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Randy was the beloved son of the emperor of Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>He himself was a superb talent that belonged to the first tier. Even if the warrior was not willing to quit, he could do nothing.</p>

  <p>Since the entire Harlen Divine Kingdom belonged to his father, none of the warriors living in the divine kingdom dared to resist any kind of decision he made. No one could afford to offend the imperial members.</p>

  <p>The divine kingdoms were just like this. Compared to sect leaders, the imperial members were more domineering, condescending, and unreasonable.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm would show the utmost respect to Randy, even though he was only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, due to his family background.</p>

  <p>Despite that, fear or indecision couldn't be found on Zheng's face. He continued moving forward as the red circle shrank, his gaze firmly fixated on Randy, who was in the middle of the circle.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Randy just smiled at Zheng and asked, "What about you? Do you also want to give up?"</p>

  <p>Although he had only met Zheng twice, he could tell that Zheng was a man who was proud of what he could do. He had always been accurate in his judgment, and so he knew that someone like Zheng would never easily give up.</p>

  <p>Of course Zheng wouldn't give up. He had traveled all this way here just to obtain the ancient jades to save Yudie. And doing so was no small feat.</p>

  <p>But then, he was not sure if he was really going to fight Randy.</p>

  <p>Upon his initial observation, he concluded that the guy was not weak at all. Although Randy had only attacked him once, Zheng already thought that he was probably slightly stronger than Esther.</p>

  <p>And although Zheng hadn't seen Amber fight in the Tower of Sin, he was sure that Randy's cultivation level would be more or less similar to hers when she had just become a top-level war lord two hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>Of course, that was only his rough estimate. He didn't know for sure what Randy could do.</p>

  <p>Despite that uncertainty, Zheng felt no fear. He had even killed Eddie, who was a warrior at the Life and Death Realm. He didn't think Randy would be stronger than Eddie.</p>

  <p>The problem was that this was only the first round of the assessment. To be honest, it would be impossible for him to unleash all of his strength if he wasn't in a life-or-death situation.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng started scheming. 'How would I be able to defeat this guy without showing him and everyone in here all I have?' he thought carefully, his eyebrows slowly furrowing.</p>

  <p>If Randy knew what Zheng was thinking, he would probably faint from anger. Fortunately, he had no means to do that. And also, all he wanted to do at that moment was test Zheng's strength as much as possible.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the red circle kept on shrinking. Zheng continued moving forward, and the distance between him and Randy grew shorter and shorter.</p>

  <p>Thirty feet. Twenty feet. Ten feet!</p>

  <p>For warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, at such a close distance, they could no longer use some of their moves or attacks.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Randy stared into each other's eyes, as if reading each other's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Strength!</p>

  <p>This was a battle of pure strength!</p>

  <p>At this moment, all of the candidates on the square were already holding their breaths.</p>

  <p>Whatever happened in the next seconds would definitely be something they were not expecting.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they admired Zheng. He was actually able to stay in the red circle even if he was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. This only proved how much of a mighty warrior he was, yet no one had heard of him before. It was hard for them to imagine how he had grown up.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they also couldn't help but mourn for Zheng in their hearts, as he was assigned to the same round of examination as Randy.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was not in the same round as Randy, then with his strength, he would have easily passed the test.</p>

  <p>But now, he had to face Randy directly. No one knew what would happen next.</p>

  <p>As they grew closer and closer to each other, Zheng's vigilance was rising.</p>

  <p>'Something is not right, ' Zheng thought, still looking at Randy. 'His strength most likely exceeds my expectations!' Tension was starting to build in his chest.</p>

  <p>Randy had seen Zheng use forceful energy before. With that, the spectators naturally concluded that he was a body refiner. Well, it was a stupid idea for a warrior who refined life vitality to compete with a body refiner in physical strength.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely wrong decision for Randy to close the distance between them.</p>

  <p>Uncannily, Randy was not afraid at all. It seemed like he was just waiting for Zheng to get closer. It was now obvious that Randy had some sort of plan to deal with this situation. Could it be that he himself was a body refiner? Or did he cultivate both body and life vitality?</p>

  <p>'Since you must have it in for me, then I'm sorry, but you're going down!'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought, getting ready to finish this round.</p>

  <p>It was not that Zheng was underestimating Randy. The strength that Zheng had and the opponents he would choose were no longer at the same level as Lord Randy.</p>

  <p>Just as the two of them were only half a meter apart, the corners of Randy's mouth curled up into a sly smile. Suddenly, a strand of pale blue forceful energy instantly appeared from within his body. Moreover, as soon as that forceful energy appeared, another strand of life vitality appeared.</p>

  <p>Forceful energy and life vitality were two completely different types of energy. Forceful energy was born from one's own body, but life vitality was created by nature and could be absorbed by warriors.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng would often let out his forceful energy and life vitality at the same time, still, they were two very different systems to him. But Randy had actually fused them together!</p>

  <p>How was he able to fuse the two completely different types of energy together?</p>

  <p>And what should the new type of energy be called?</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was knowledgeable and had seen a lot of things, he was still shocked when he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>Everything that existed in the divine kingdoms couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>After fusing the forceful energy and life vitality, Randy spread out his hands and pushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't punch Zheng. It seemed that he truly wanted to compete with Zheng in physical strength, and that he didn't have any intention of harming him.</p>

  <p>Caution was starting to color Zheng's already shocked face. He circulated the power in his hands and caused the forceful energy within his body to erupt. At the same time, he also used the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Originally, Zheng had planned to use only forceful energy to deal with Randy. After all, he was only at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and Zheng thought that would be more than enough.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng discovered that Randy was able to fuse forceful energy and life vitality, he immediately changed his mind. He couldn't underestimate Randy.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng had only absorbed about half of the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng also outstretched his arms, his palms open. His speed was not that fast, but a shocking power was contained in his palms.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's palms collided with Randy's.</p>

  <p>A muffled sound burst out.</p>

  <p>The floor covered in patterns underneath their feet suddenly shook violently, and cracks began to appear on it.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Since this square was used for the exam of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, the materials that were used to build the floor had been processed meticulously to fit the purpose. Previously, when there were so many warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm fighting, not a single trace of crack was left. But this time, numerous cracks appeared on the floor just as Zheng's and Randy's palms collided.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still pondering on how Randy was able to fuse the two types of energies together. 'What cultivation method is he cultivating? It is indeed amazing!' he thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng managed to block this special energy in the end. Although the floor beneath his feet cracked open, he still stood firmly in place.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's explosive power of dragon scales and his forceful energy, the previously relaxed expression on Randy's face suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's hidden power was too huge.</p>

  <p>Even though Randy was able to sense that Zheng was not a simple warrior upon seeing him, he had never thought that he would be this powerful.</p>

  <p>He was born and bred in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Because his talent was outstanding, he was doted upon by his father. Although there were many princes in the Harlen Divine Kingdom, his talent set him apart, and because of that, the resources he received were abundant and generous.</p>

  <p>In this environment, his knowledge expanded, further than anyone else in the kingdom.</p>

  <p>With that, he knew that Zheng's strength shouldn't have appeared in a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Even a warrior who had experienced a life and death crisis would find it difficult to resist Zheng's strength. Just how did Zheng manage to do it?</p>

  <p>His force was so hard to resist that it was like the tides of the ocean. A human would not be able to withstand such force.</p>

  <p>Although he was overwhelmed by this sudden realization, Randy was not willing to back down. He would see this test to the end, and he would succeed! There was no way he was going to retreat after all the boasting he did a while ago.</p>

  <p>He would rather Zheng back out of the red circle right now and admit defeat. He would personally give a Harlen Token to Zheng. After all, their purpose of competing in the exam was for the Harlen Tokens.</p>

  <p>It was just a Harlen Token!</p>

  <p>However, it was too late to say anything now. Under Zheng's overwhelming power, he had no choice.</p>

  <p>Thus, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Randy retreated.</p>

  <p>One step! Two steps! Three steps...</p>

  <p>Without doing anything flashy, he crossed the red circle. However, that wasn't the craziest thing to happen in this whole round. As Randy continued retreating, his steps also became unsteady. In the end, everyone saw his legs weaken and he actually fell onto the floor!</p>

  <p>Everyone stared blankly at him, speechless at what was happening.</p>

  <p>Randy, whose talent was ranked in the first tier, actually was invincible among the young generation. In the entire Jade Martial House, only Gregory was comparable to him and his power. In the entire Harlen Divine Kingdom, only Edwin and the crown prince could match up to him.</p>

  <p>Randy and Zheng weren't fighting to the death just now— it was just a simple contest of pure strength.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, however, in a battle of strength, Randy was at an absolute disadvantage.</p>
