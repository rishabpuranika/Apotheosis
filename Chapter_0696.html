<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 696 Yudie's Feelings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had improved the level of his pagoda, he did not stop. Instead, he rushed toward Stoney Zhao's territory.</p>

  <p>Although the sixth wave of attack of the beasts would be more violent than the fifth one, it was easy to deal with as Lily was guarding his pagoda.</p>

  <p>What was more, Zheng's tower was one level higher than that of others.</p>

  <p>Just after Luo Zheng left, several three-meter-long purple jade centipedes zigzagged over. Each had thousands of pairs of thin feet that moved across the ground swiftly.</p>

  <p>The six archers in Zheng's tower raised their longbows and shot six arrows toward the sky.</p>

  <p>"Schwaff, schwaff, schwaff!"</p>

  <p>The arrows flew up before turning and heading toward the centipedes. Each arrow, attached to a string of flames, landed among the purple jade centipedes.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>Six explosions were heard, and in the next instant, one or two hundred centipedes were destroyed by the tower. And this was only the first wave attack by the archers.</p>

  <p>Seeing the scene, the middle-aged martial artist complained, "I just knew Luo Zheng would do something and break the balance of competition!"</p>

  <p>Michael Mo could not help but smile wryly. Under normal circumstances, a tower at the fifth level would be defending against attacks from the purple jade centipedes! Similarly, towers at the sixth level would be battling against the seventh wave, which would have more powerful beasts.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had used his points to improve the tower and it had reached the sixth level, the pagoda was so powerful that the purple jade centipedes had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Xiao's mustache twitched as he spoke, "He has done it. What would you want to do?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man placed significant value on the rules of the magic array. Thus, he could only focus on the fact that Luo Zheng had broken the rules.</p>

  <p>He contemplated for a while and then said, "How about we remove Luo Zheng from the magic array?"</p>

  <p>As Xiao's eyes met Michael's, they both shook their heads. Michael replied,</p>

  <p>"I don't think that is a good idea. But you preside over the magic array. So it is your decision."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man stared at Luo Zheng on the Picture Slab. He watched with narrowed eyes as Luo Zheng ran to Stoney's territory to kill the purple jade centipedes. Soon, he reached a decision and said, "Well, I've decided. I am going to kick Luo Zheng out!"</p>

  <p>Then he asked some subordinates to push a nearby platform.</p>

  <p>An enormous magic array platform controlled the magic array, and several servants, after receiving the order from the middle-aged man, quickly pushed a table-sized magic array platform over.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man stood on the magic array platform and touched a complex rune on the platform. It was very easy for him to drive Luo Zheng out of the magic array, and Luo Zheng would be unable to stop it.</p>

  <p>Just as the middle-aged man was about to remove Luo Zheng from the magic array, a person appeared near the palace door.</p>

  <p>The person was dressed in an ice-blue dress with fringes that dazzled in the bright light.</p>

  <p>When the middle-aged martial artist and Michael saw this person, they smiled and made obeisance to her before saying, "Miss Ning, welcome!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie walked across gracefully. In her glimmering blue dress, she looked like an elf born from mysterious ice. A cloud of cold air swirled around her body. As soon as she neared people, the cold air around her would refresh everyone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mo, Mr. Xiao, and..." Ning Yudie looked at the middle-aged martial artist.</p>

  <p>She knew Michael and Elder Xiao but didn't know who the middle-aged man was.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man didn't dare to snub Ning Yudie. He introduced himself,</p>

  <p>"My name is Cole Sang. I am the chairman of the magic array!"</p>

  <p>"Eh," Ning Yudie replied softly. Then she looked at the huge Picture Slab on the wall. Surprise reflected in her eyes when she saw what Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>Seeing Ning Yudie watching Luo Zheng, Michael smiled and asked, "Miss Ning, this boy is one of your Cloud Hall disciples, right?"</p>

  <p>Michael had been puzzled about Zheng's position at Cloud Hall for a while.</p>

  <p>The first time he met Luo Zheng at Cloudy City, Michael couldn't understand why Cloud Hall would let a runic expert with Perfect Brushwork walk freely.</p>

  <p>Michael even conjectured that Cloud Hall might not know that Luo Zheng had Perfect Brushwork. To clarify, Michael consulted Lasseter but was told that it was impossible as the chief runic expert of Cloud Hall knew of Zheng's ability.</p>

  <p>How could Cloud Hall ignore such a talented runic expert?</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was to participate in the Martial Arts Contest, Cloud Hall seemed to be unwilling to give him a direct license. Instead of allowing Luo Zheng to join the main draw match directly based on his skills, they forced Luo Zheng to join the others in the pre-qualifying match at first. That was strange!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded and replied, "Yes, Luo Zheng is one of our Elite House disciples.</p>

  <p>How did he perform?"</p>

  <p>"Um... He did well. You could ask Cole. He is the chairman of the magic array." Michael smiled and eyed Cole as he thought, 'Cole, you wanted to kick Luo Zheng out of the magic array. Now, I want to know what you will say to her.'</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at Cole with a curious expression.</p>

  <p>Before the Martial Arts Contest began, contestants participating in the pre-qualifying match had to compete to be eligible for the main draw match.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in addition to training, Ning Yudie had been relatively relaxed over the past several days.</p>

  <p>During practice today, she felt concerned about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall did not give Luo Zheng permission to enter the main draw match directly. If he wanted to participate in the main draw match, he had to go through the pre-qualifying match, step by step. Eventually, she came to see.</p>

  <p>The pre-qualifying match had stretched over a few days. Each day would bring three new winners. Ning Yudie was unsure whether or not Luo Zheng would fight today, but she was lucky to see him. It seemed that several elders of the World Commercial Alliance were equally fascinated by him.</p>

  <p>Michael turned Yudie's attention to Cole. Cole forced a wry smile. Like many sword practitioners, Cole was stubborn, decent, and not good at lying.</p>

  <p>He said, "Well, Miss Ning, I was just going to remove Luo Zheng from the magic array."</p>

  <p>"Why?" A light flickered in Yudie's eyes, and frown lines appeared on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Ning Yudie was so concerned, Michael sighed. It seemed that he had been wrong in his assumptions as Ning Yudie cared about Luo Zheng a lot. However, Michael did not know why Ning Yudie hadn't given Luo Zheng a license to the main draw match. Michael could not figure out this mystery.</p>

  <p>Cole thought his decision to remove Luo Zheng was appropriate. So, he ignored Yudie's expression, turned to the Picture Slab, and said, "Miss Ning, you will understand after you see what Luo Zheng is doing!"</p>

  <p>The Picture Slab showed that Luo Zheng was absorbed in his fight with the purple jade centipedes.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie just glanced at it and then said, "Isn't this very normal?"</p>

  <p>Cole smiled bitterly and asked, "Miss, do you know anything about our magic array?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded and responded, "Yes, I know about the content of the pre-qualifying match."</p>

  <p>Cole adjusted the images on the Picture Slab, pointed to Stoney, and said,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is indeed killing purple jade centipedes, but those are not from his territory."</p>

  <p>"Um?" Ning Yudie felt a bit confused.</p>

  <p>Then, Cole switched the image on the Picture Slab to Zheng's territory and explained, "Look! Luo Zheng asked his sword spirit to guard his territory, and at the same time, he ran into another person's area to plunder his points. As a result, his pagoda is at a higher level than that of others. He will not be challenged in the remaining attack waves!"</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Zheng kept his tower one level higher, he would pass the first phase of the pre-qualifying match easily.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was surprised. She recovered a few seconds later. The frown lines on her forehead smoothed, and her eyes resembled crescent moons.</p>

  <p>However, as Cloud Hall Leader, she had to be solemn and pay attention to her manners. At least, she should act more serious in front of these people, not like her casual behavior when she was alone with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was indeed happy. Luo Zheng seemed to find unusual ways of overcoming challenges.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts and feelings about this situation were contradictory. On the one hand, she hoped that Luo Zheng would not pass the pre-qualifying match.</p>

  <p>Although the main draw match appeared to be like any other competition, it was, in fact, a brutal war. Luo Zheng had a saint-level talent in cultivating; however, his cultivation level was still too low. Therefore, he should hide his talent until he became an influential cultivator!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, she knew that Luo Zheng was fiercely determined. Once he had decided something, there was no possibility of changing his mind. Ning Yudie believed that Luo Zheng would pass the pre-qualifying match, and a part of her was looking forward to that.</p>

  <p>The two conflicting feelings intertwined and left her anxious. This was why she had come to observe Zheng's performance. However, she didn't expect that she would see such a scene.</p>
