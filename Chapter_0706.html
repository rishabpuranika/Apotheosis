  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had gotten himself ready to experience the agonizing pain of body refinement, but never would he have thought that it would be extremely intolerable.</p>

  <p>His soul had already set foot inside the Fighting Soul Realm, and his willpower had also gone up a couple of notches. However, his mind and body just couldn't bear the excruciating pain, causing him to pass out.</p>

  <p>Holding a freshly brewed pot of hot tea, a girl dressed in green silk entered.</p>

  <p>Possessing a set of eyes so pure, the girl didn't look half bad at all. Her bangs had been cut short.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you finally came to." Upon seeing Luo Luo Zheng open his eyes, she immediately poured hot tea over a cup and handed it over to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shot the girl a bit of a reluctant gaze, but it didn't take too long for him to understand that she was just a regular person who had nothing to do with martial arts whatsoever, so he was able to ease up on her in no time. He nodded politely toward the girl, carefully grabbed the cup and gulped a mouthful of refreshing hot tea.</p>

  <p>"I noticed how your face looked as if you were under so much pain. Would you like for me to fetch a doctor for you?" Although Alice Bi was aware that the bodies of warriors could be quite different from those of the common folk, she still felt like Luo Luo Zheng was in need of medical supervision as he had been racked with pain and so much torment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply let out a faint smile and shook his head in refusal, "No, thanks.</p>

  <p>That wouldn't be necessary. The doctor wouldn't be able to treat me anyway."</p>

  <p>"How can you be so sure? I know of a talented doctor who has Wang as his last name. His clinic is just around the bend. For decades now, he has been a seasoned doctor. He's the one who used to..." Alice Bi remarked in a tender and comprehensible voice. Surprisingly, Luo Luo Zheng didn't find her irritating at all.</p>

  <p>The whole time that the girl was giving her explanation, Luo Luo Zheng just silently wore a soft smile on his face. He didn't bother stopping her in her tracks.</p>

  <p>Instead, he just let her continue.</p>

  <p>But Alice was quite intuitive. The second she realized that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't listening to her, she became quiet, and she just kept staring at Luo Luo Zheng. "Well, you made an oath to keep my father's courtyard intact back when you rented it, but you went ahead and laid waste to the rooms and floors inside. I'm gonna have to ask you to pay for the damages."</p>

  <p>During the time when Luo Luo Zheng was receiving training in the courtyard, not a single one among the members of the Bi family had the guts to take a peek.</p>

  <p>But Alice Bi hadn't been fazed at all, to the point that she even extended a helping hand in cleaning up the mess.</p>

  <p>Her father used to tell her all the time how a lot of martial artists felt like they were above the law and would go on to rape any girls they might like, but something of Luo Luo Zheng told her that he couldn't be one of those wretched types of men.</p>

  <p>Her father had been heartbroken upon seeing so much destruction in the courtyard, but he was much too afraid to ask Luo Luo Zheng to pay for the damages, so Alice decided to come in his stead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly recalled what he had done and realized that he had just wrecked some of the rooms, so he pulled out more than ten low-grade life vitality crystals stored inside his space ring and handed them over to Alice.</p>

  <p>"Would these life vitality crystals be enough?"</p>

  <p>These were the low-grade life vitality crystals Luo Luo Zheng received as change from back when he bought some materials for drawing divine textures.</p>

  <p>As the sight of more than a dozen low-grade life vitality crystals in Luo Zheng's hand, Alice couldn't believe her eyes. Shaking her head repeatedly, she blurted out, "This is a bit too much."</p>

  <p>An overwhelming gap existed between ordinary people and the warriors.</p>

  <p>The Bi family could be considered rich in Oracle City. However, the gold they allotted for food consumption and clothing throughout the year wouldn't even be worth more than one, or possibly, two low-grade life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Half a low-grade life vitality crystal would actually be more than enough already to fix the damages to the rooms and walls. The low-grade life vitality crystals Luo Luo Zheng offered was such a large amount of money for the Bi family no matter how one might look at it. If Alice's father were to find out that Alice even tried to refuse, he would be raging with intense anger. But Luo Luo Zheng insisted and placed the low-grade life vitality crystals in Alice's hands.</p>

  <p>Alice was sincerely so hesitant to accept it, but pondering on it, this could make her father so happy, so she gladly left holding the crystals in her hands. The second she walked away, she informed Luo Luo Zheng that she'd bring dinner over to him when night fell.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Alice left, Luo Luo Zheng sprung up from his bed. It seemed that luck wasn't on his side, as he hit his head on the wooden ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Oww!" Luo Luo Zheng cried out under intense pain.</p>

  <p>Hearing the clamor, Alice hurriedly went back and poked her head through the door's opening, feeling quite curious.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rubbed his head in embarrassment. He simply laughed it off and said,</p>

  <p>"Sorry about that. I'll make sure to pay for anything I might break."</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Luo Zheng had always been under the assumption that the warm current could only be able to help him get rid of the impurities inside his body. The first step one would have to take in order to reach the nature level was to get rid of the impurities in his body and make it absolutely pure.</p>

  <p>Upon attaining the nature level, however, the aforementioned warm current had little to almost no effect on him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until today that he finally learned how to utilize the primordial energy. This was something essential for training one's body refining skills.</p>
