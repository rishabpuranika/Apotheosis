  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Oh no! He has really jumped into the halo!"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't he care about his own life?"</p>

  <p>"Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods hadn't expected Luo Zheng to really jump, which was why they were so astonished when he did.</p>

  <p>Aleyna's and Kelsey's eyes were wide open, their hands at their mouths in shock.</p>

  <p>After a while, Aleyna whispered, "Liusu, what did he say to you?"</p>

  <p>Liusu was lost in thought. At Aleyna's question, she smiled and said softly, "He asked me to wait for him."</p>

  <p>Liusu knew Luo Zheng's motives very well.</p>

  <p>If he left the Time Sea Forbidden Land now, Luo Zheng would be at a dead end.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew what would happen to him if Nicholas were to lay hands on him. It was a fact that Samuel couldn't save him. And although Joy was a Demi-holy Being, she couldn't win against Nicholas either.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might just get lucky by jumping into the light and be able to reverse what was happening.</p>

  <p>Another figure in red jumped up and into the colorful light, disappearing from before everyone's eyes and leaving behind circles of shallow ripples that spread slowly.</p>

  <p>"It's Nelly!"</p>

  <p>"She has also jumped in!"</p>

  <p>"Young people are getting bolder by the day!"</p>

  <p>Liusu was encouraged, seeing that Nelly had also jumped in.</p>

  <p>No one knew where the colorful halo led to. Perhaps it led back to the past or perhaps it led to a dangerous, secret land where they would all meet.</p>

  <p>But Liusu was willing to take the risk, as long as it was for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>While Liusu was lost in her thoughts, Aleyna grabbed her clothes from behind.</p>

  <p>She whispered to Liusu, "Liusu, you have to trust him. I'm sure he will return safe and sound."</p>

  <p>Aleyna knew what was on Liusu's mind, which was why she decided to stop her before Liusu could follow Luo Zheng and jump in after him.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, please don't leave us alone," Aleyna begged.</p>

  <p>Liusu looked at Aleyna's pleading face and heaved a sigh. Luo Zheng had always been able to turn any kind of bad luck around. She hoped that he would return safely this time as well.</p>

  <p>Following this, about thirty True Gods jumped in one after another.</p>

  <p>A few of the True Gods tried to use their techniques to get the jade seal out. But everything disappeared as soon as it entered the light.</p>

  <p>They had tried all sorts of methods before they were left with no choice but to give up and think about leaving the Time Sea Forbidden Land instead.</p>

  <p>The moment he jumped into the colorful halo, Luo Zheng felt his whole body become soft, as if it had turned into an infinitely long noodle, sliding towards the bottom.</p>

  <p>The surrounding scenery also morphed into something very strange.</p>

  <p>The colorful lights stretched unceasingly, turning into colorful noodles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng studied the noodles carefully. He could see a few flesh-colored noodles and stared at them for a while before he recognized that they were other True Gods. Like his own, their bodies were stretched like noodles too and fell along the light beams.</p>

  <p>'I wonder where this time channel leads to, '</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>But no matter where he went, it was better than walking out of the Time Sea Forbidden Land and falling into Nicholas's hands.</p>

  <p>Besides, time and space were two closely linked concepts.</p>

  <p>For example, the countless time fragments in the Time Sea were independent spaces, but they represented the past.</p>

  <p>Crank! Crank!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly heard a strange sound.</p>

  <p>He looked up in time to see a black noodle slide by.</p>

  <p>"Is it an insect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured, his heart skipping a beat.</p>

  <p>A pair of pincers sat on the top of the black noodle, like scissors, and behind these pincers were dark eyes that shone brightly. On both sides of its long, thin body were slender feet, like those of a millipede.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had jumped into the halo, he could only move along these colorful beams of light. He couldn't move by himself. The other True Gods were the same.</p>

  <p>However, the black insect waved its slender feet and could swim in the beams of light.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, it swam above a flesh-colored noodle, waving its scissors-like pincers.</p>

  <p>"Does it want to eat that True God?" Luo Zheng's heart skipped yet another beat.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances he was in, Luo Zheng couldn't even make a sound, let alone resist.</p>

  <p>He soon saw red spots emerge from one end of the flesh-colored noodle.</p>

  <p>"It's blood!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exclaimed, his eyes narrowing.</p>

  <p>The black insect swallowed the flesh-colored noodle inch by inch, actively reducing its length.</p>

  <p>Crank! Crank!</p>

  <p>The black insect swallowed the True God and began to wander in the light again.</p>

  <p>On witnessing this, all the True Gods were fervently praying that the black insect wouldn't choose them. But not long after, the insect finally chose another True God, crawled slowly up to him, and swallowed him inch by inch.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who the True Gods that have been swallowed up are. They were so unlucky!" Luo Zheng sighed. He knew that it was rather pitiful to die like this.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng thought this, the black insect wandered for a while, and then made its way to him.</p>

  <p>"Holy crap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, his heart sinking.</p>

  <p>As the black insect got closer and closer to him, he became more and more anxious.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how long this channel would take. He would probably die if he didn't leave this channel soon.</p>

  <p>Crank! Crank!</p>

  <p>The strange sound became louder and louder. The black insect got closer and closer to Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng became increasingly nervous.</p>

  <p>A sudden light glowed from below him at this moment.</p>

  <p>He looked down and saw that the streak of light had stopped close by. At the end of it was a small halo, exactly the same as the one he had seen in the valley.</p>

  <p>"Is this the exit?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered to himself, his heart thumping wildly.</p>

  <p>Although he had descended at quite a pace, the black insect moved faster in the light. Luo Zheng didn't know if he could hold on.</p>

  <p>'Faster! Much faster!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought frantically.</p>

  <p>The exit was getting closer and closer, but the black insect had already arrived above his head, the pair of pincers looming close to his head.</p>

  <p>His eyes passed the scissors-like pincers.</p>

  <p>A chill passed through him at the sight of the pair of cold, dark eyes.</p>

  <p>The pincers were unleashed and bit his head rather violently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a sharp pain.</p>

  <p>In that moment, Luo Zheng felt a sudden loosening of his whole body, and then he was free again!</p>

  <p>Before he could identify his surroundings, he twisted his body and changed direction. He found a pair of huge pincers clamped tightly around him, and spikes embedded in his head.</p>

  <p>The black insect rushed out of the halo along with him, but half of its body was still stuck in the halo.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Zheng felt the pincers emitting a heavy force. The insect wanted to drag him back to the time channel.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered since he had been unable to move.</p>

  <p>But now the situation was different.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the two large pincers with both his hands, causing a force to rush forth and explode. He then dragged the insect out.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he summoned his Buddha Emperor Sword and Heavenly Tooth Sword.</p>

  <p>He concentrated his energy, and two balls of strength source appeared outside his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had almost been eaten up by this black insect and now that he was sufficiently angry, how could he let it go? He would not rest before killing it!</p>

  <p>But he didn't expect the two balls of strength source to burst into pieces as soon as they were formed.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Luo Zheng exclaimed, astonishment written large on his face.</p>

  <p>He found that he couldn't use the strength source, and the Separate Controlling of the Purple Aura Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But he was smart enough to twist the two pincers.</p>

  <p>And with two resounding cracks, the pincers broke.</p>

  <p>The insect, at Luo Zheng's explosive power, looked at Luo Zheng fearfully. It did not dare to do anything else but quickly retreated into the colorful halo.</p>
