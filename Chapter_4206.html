<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the black heavy armor came at him again wielding the heavy sword, Zheng's initially sluggish body suddenly was able to move nimbly.</p>

  <p>As he bended down slightly, the irregular heavy sword swept past his shoulder, missing him by an inch.</p>

  <p>He took this as an opportunity to get close to the black armor. Raising his hand, he cried out, "Destructive power, three blows!"</p>

  <p>In the blood red sky of the primitive land, nine kinds of power of the destruction quadrant began to merge with each other, turning into three kinds of power.</p>

  <p>The three kinds of power gathered in Zheng's palm and he slapped the chest plate of the black armor, leaving a clear palm print.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>The palm print then exploded three times in a row.</p>

  <p>The noise from the explosions was not too loud, and the power contained in the slaps wasn't formidable.</p>

  <p>But its destructive power was limited to the palm print on the black armor's chest, meaning all the force was concentrated solely on that one spot alone.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack!</p>

  <p>The black armor began to crack. On the third crack, the right side of the armor exploded to reveal the body of Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword obviously hadn't expected that Zheng would be able to launch a counterattack so smoothly. The heavy sword changed the rules again, making everything in the space become light, and it simultaneously stabbed at Zheng's head with great momentum.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the heavy sword changed the rules, Zheng was able to adapt instantly. Gently twisting his body like a lithe snake, he narrowly avoided the thrust of the sword blade. In one swift motion, Zheng reached out and pressed his palm against the blade of the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng touched it, his palm print was accurately imprinted on the blade.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>Another three muffled sounds rang out.</p>

  <p>The surface of the irregular heavy sword, which had been restored to its original shape previously, began to crack once more.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what..."</p>

  <p>Even though Kincaid was bound inside the Treacherous Being body, he could still feel the pain of the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Even when facing the Death Sword, not only was Zheng able to adapt to its rules quickly, but he was even able to severely damage the sword!</p>

  <p>He really had a chance at winning!</p>

  <p>This was the first time such a thought had crossed Kincaid's mind.</p>

  <p>This time, he no longer felt ridiculous. Instead, he became very excited.</p>

  <p>He had not yet awakened, and being trapped in the Treacherous Being body was not something he wanted.</p>

  <p>In fact, he always wanted to break free from this 'prison', but this wish had never been granted.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng wouldn't be able to wake him up, but at least he could bring him out of the altar...</p>

  <p>"It's all up to you, extraordinary human being..." Kincaid muttered, feeling a glimmer of hope well within him.</p>

  <p>As a Human Spirit King, he looked down upon human beings. This kind of contempt was the attitude that the creatures of a high-grade world would have towards a low-grade world, similar to how people were disgusted by insects crawling on the ground.</p>

  <p>While Zheng did attract the attention of Kincaid before, he only viewed him as a human slightly stronger than the others.</p>

  <p>Now, Kincaid realized that he might have misjudged.</p>

  <p>After all, he hadn't awakened yet, so he couldn't observe the outside world directly. He could only infer and make a judgment from some hazy sensations.</p>

  <p>The strength of this human being was probably beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>This thought made his heart beat faster as hope surged within him, like water gushing out from a dried out spring.</p>

  <p>Just as Kincaid got his hopes up, the basic rules of this world suddenly became extremely complicated: every three seconds, the basic rules changed.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior was in this space, even if the irregular heavy sword did not attack them, they would still be killed by this rapidly changing basic rules.</p>

  <p>However, the one facing the irregular heavy sword was Zheng who had the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>No matter how quickly the basic rules were revised, Zheng could instantly unleash the blood power to deal with it.</p>

  <p>The sword's methods and Zheng's methods could evenly balance each other out.</p>

  <p>This battle lasted for a full five minutes.</p>

  <p>At this point, both of them stood glued to their spots, unmoving. It had become a silent battle.</p>

  <p>In the end, the irregular heavy sword was still unable to get around Zheng's rules.</p>

  <p>It had run out of patience.</p>

  <p>As the sword emitted rays of green light, this infinite space was filled with the life energy, as though life pulsated everywhere infinitely.</p>

  <p>The horizontal and vertical rays of green light in the space then turned into balls, and the abundant life energy gathered within these balls. Then, these balls hatched open, birthing countless monsters with two feet and two pincers.</p>

  <p>These monsters emitted a powerful aura the second they were born.</p>

  <p>There was no emotion in their eyes, but they were all fixated on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Awaiting orders, they seemed restless, impatiently wanting to devour Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Do you plan on winning by relying on the advantage of numbers?"</p>

  <p>Zheng taunted with a smile.</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment. Many incarnations of himself constantly formed in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>After these incarnations appeared, they flew straight towards the center of the primitive land. Rushing out of the dome, these incarnations appeared beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>One, two, three...</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, hundreds of his incarnations stood beside Zheng, and the number was still increasing with each second that passed.</p>

  <p>This time, what Zheng used was not the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but the power of the primitive land!</p>

  <p>Seeing how the number of Zheng's clones had soared, the monsters surged forward to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Go," Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>His clones were also endowed with spirituality and began to fight the monsters with pincers.</p>

  <p>This was no longer a one-on-one battle, but a battle involving countless warriors. Chaos ensued.</p>

  <p>Boom! Whoosh! Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor the irregular heavy sword joined in on the fighting.</p>

  <p>Instead, the two looked at each other from afar while observing the chaotic situation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, outside the altar, when the Treacherous Beings were done cleaning up all of the snake spirits, they once again gathered above the altar.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King broke the silence first, asking, "What should we do next?"</p>

  <p>It was not until the Monkey Masters calmed down from their excitement over defeating their opponents did they realize that the war wasn't over. In fact, it had just begun.</p>

  <p>"Let's find out the Snake Spirit King's coordinates," suggested Manuel.</p>

  <p>"If we destroy his coordinates, then the Snake Spirit King won't come back to life..." Hagar agreed with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess glanced at the Monkey Masters almost disdainfully.</p>

  <p>'These brainless creatures could only talk nonsense, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>"Since he has the Space Guiding Stone, it'd be difficult to find his coordinates," Lawler said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Then, what are we supposed to do?" Manuel asked again, scratching his head.</p>

  <p>"Guard with all your might," the Snake Goddess suddenly cut in.</p>

  <p>"How long will we guard here?" asked Alphonse.</p>

  <p>In the prior battle, the ones who had made the greatest contributions were the human beings, especially Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Thanks to this, the human spirits and the bird spirits now looked up to them and were willing to listen to their opinions.</p>

  <p>"Guard," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a serious tone, "until Zheng comes out."</p>

  <p>Hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, Lawler countered unhappily, "Time is of the essence. We need to fight against the Snake Spirit King, not guard by all means!"</p>

  <p>"Can Zheng really find our king?" Alphonse asked worriedly, ignoring Lawler's outburst.</p>

  <p>Even though the humans had garnered some respect by now, the human spirits and the Bird Masters were not willing to place their hopes on Zheng alone.</p>

  <p>Seeing that there were different opinions going around, the Monkey Spirit King touched the necklace of teeth on his chest and grinned. "I believe in that guy, and we can guard with all our might," he said.</p>
