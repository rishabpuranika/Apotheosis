<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3502 The Energy Vortex </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Though it was a false alarm, the disciples who witnessed what happened couldn't help but feel frightened.</p>

  <p>They tried to huddle together in the very narrow path.</p>

  <p>But Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>After all, he had stayed in the Dark Region for a period of time and already knew how dangerous it was.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they had Feng Ge, who was a purified being, by their side. They could even roam the Dark Region freely if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood up and returned to the path. When he felt the fear among the disciples, he smiled and said, "You see, the creatures in the Dark Region are no match for Princess Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please go first. I'll protect you," Feng Ge announced.</p>

  <p>The disciples just nodded and mentally sighed.</p>

  <p>Many talented warriors had come forth among this generation in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>There were so many talents that even a genius like Milo, who was capable of Instant Enlightenment, was not considered outstanding among them.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he had been making miracles in both the Chaotic Source World and the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Feng Ge, who was considered as mediocre in the Source World, was quite invincible on the Other Shore. She was incredibly skilled in killing the creatures in the Dark Region so easily, which was unheard of.</p>

  <p>The disciples lined up in a straight line and continued to move forward on the narrow path, while Feng Ge stayed behind to protect them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Feng Ge's ability shocked the creatures in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The roars that echoed in the Dark Region had completely died down. They didn't encounter any attacks along their way anymore.</p>

  <p>After they walked along the narrow path for about ten minutes, the path finally became wide and a stone platform appeared in front of them. This stone platform was the edge of the Lust World.</p>

  <p>The sky in the distance seemed to be washed with various colors of water.</p>

  <p>It was quite a sight to behold.</p>

  <p>Among the many hues was a small black hole, where all the colors apparently came from. "The energy contained in those flowing colors is so unique," said Zheng as he gazed into the horizon.</p>

  <p>He could clearly perceive the energy within those colors. It was extremely powerful and similar to the Ways-blending Energy, but they differed in aura.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared at the colors and said, "It is said that it's the energy of the Other Shore. It is the one that forms the thirty-three stages, little by little."</p>

  <p>"The energy of the thirty-three stages?" Zheng repeated, his eyebrows raised in surprise. "Yes, that's true," Chaim said with a nod.</p>

  <p>"But we can't use the energy, so no one has ever studied it," he added.</p>

  <p>"Chaim, is that vortex the place we are going to pass through?" Sally asked as she walked beside them. "Yes," Chaim confirmed.</p>

  <p>"Now that we have arrived at the destination, we can advance to Stage Fourteen. We can't help each other from now on. We can only rely on ourselves and the Cloud Flying Wheels in your hands. Mind the colorful ribbons, as they are actually an extremely powerful flow of energy. Once you are sucked in, no one would be able to save you," he explained.</p>

  <p>When he finished, everyone felt their hearts sink in their chests.</p>

  <p>They were lucky enough to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, but it did not mean that their troubles were over.</p>

  <p>They were still weak Souls of Light on the Other Shore, after all.</p>

  <p>"Who goes first?" Chaim asked. The disciples fell into silence.</p>

  <p>To be fair, it was their first time to experience such a thing, and the ones who went first would clearly face the biggest risks.</p>

  <p>"Me," a man said as he stepped out. It turned out to be Milo, a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>"Milo, please," said Chaim with his cupped hands.</p>

  <p>Milo did not feel any fear for what he must endure.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, he stood on the edge of the stone platform and activated the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand.</p>

  <p>A thick cloud appeared as the Cloud Flying Wheel rotated continuously in his palm. At the same time, a force was exerted on his Soul of Light, which pushed him straight out of the stone platform and sent him flying in the air.</p>

  <p>Milo's figure flew higher and higher, until he was just like a tiny black dot to everyone below. Still, they could see his location through the white cloud that the Cloud Flying Wheel had created.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the white cloud approached the colorful vortex.</p>

  <p>The closer one got to the vortex, the more dangerous it was for them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Milo controlled the Cloud Flying Wheel to carefully swirl amidst the energy ribbons.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he arrived at the center of the vortex. He felt as if an invisible gravitational force pulled him in, and then he was suddenly sucked into the vortex.</p>

  <p>"The next one," said Chaim after Milo disappeared in the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>Once the disciples saw how smoothly Milo went into the vortex, they felt braver and more encouraged. Another disciple took out his Cloud Flying Wheel and directly flew towards the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>Zheng observed them for a while, and then retreated to the back of the line and handed his Cloud Flying Wheel to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Other warriors only needed to fly to the Desire World once, while Zheng needed to do it twice. His corporeal body also needed the Cloud Flying Wheel.</p>

  <p>"Do you need me to pick you up?" Feng Ge asked Zheng with concern after Dorothy had put the Cloud Flying Wheel away.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's corporeal body was much stronger than his Soul of Light, it was quite dangerous for him to go through the narrow path. Feng Ge was worried about him.</p>

  <p>"No, it's not dangerous for me," Zheng said confidently.</p>

  <p>Then, he disappeared on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was gone, Feng Ge and Dorothy exchanged knowing looks.</p>

  <p>It was as if they could read each other's minds. Their strained relations surfaced.</p>

  <p>"We can't look down on Zheng, can we?" Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked a few times. "Are you upset? Because you can't help Zheng?" she asked.</p>

  <p>A pink flush crept on Dorothy's cheeks at Feng Ge's words. "No, I just don't think Zheng is that incompetent," she immediately explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said Feng Ge in an aloof voice. "You are jealous."</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>"I guessed it right," Feng Ge said calmly, and then continued, "I heard that you knew Zheng before he came to the Source World. He joined the Oneness Sky Palace with your help."</p>

  <p>Of course, there were many factors that caused Zheng to join the Oneness Sky Palace, but the most important part was that Dorothy had acted as a go-between for him in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"But there's one thing you need to understand. Zheng doesn't belong only to you," said Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>It was true that Feng Ge was a cold woman, but she was always straightforward and honest.</p>
