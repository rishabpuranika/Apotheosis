  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the soul of the hall and continued his questions, "Will my tainted blood still be qualified to control the Incarnation Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the soul replied. "If you pass the test, you are still qualified to control the Reincarnation Hall, but you cannot use the Reincarnation Soul Weapon."</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Soul Weapon?" Zheng asked, his gaze narrowing.</p>

  <p>"What is it used for?"</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Soul Weapon can wake the Memory Flame of any creature in all their lives," the soul answered.</p>

  <p>"Wake the Memory Flame? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused at the soul's words and couldn't make head nor tail of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It can wake the Memory Flame of any creature in all their lives," it repeated.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was still at a loss. No. 9527 spoke up, "I see. The divine land has used the rule of endless reincarnation. It looks like Chiyou has placed great hopes on the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Endless reincarnation? What's this?" Zheng said, surprised yet again. He was realizing that he had encountered an alien domain of knowledge.</p>

  <p>"When one creates a world, there are two kinds of reincarnation rules.</p>

  <p>The first is the one-time reincarnation rule, under which one can only inherit the memories of the previous life, and each living creature has only one chance of reincarnation," No. 9527 continued to explain. "After this chance of reincarnation is used, the Memory Flame will disappear completely."</p>

  <p>"What about endless reincarnation?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Under the rule of endless reincarnation, a Memory Flame is born every time one dies. All creatures can retrieve the Memory Flame of any of their previous lives," No. 9527 said, smiling faintly. "So in theory, creatures who are qualified to have the endless reincarnation will never die."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng said, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Of course," No. 9527 said. "The rule of endless reincarnation applies to any perfect worlds that the powerful masters have built in the Source World."</p>

  <p>Once the most powerful extraordinary creatures had created grand worlds in the chaos, they would then continuously select talents in the grand worlds.</p>

  <p>Many geniuses with powerful talents would probably die before they were fully grown.</p>

  <p>However, with endless reincarnation, the talents that died could be reincarnated for unlimited times. Every reincarnation was a process of accumulating, a very complicated system behind it. Every death was a process of cultivation and with the accumulation of numerous reincarnations, these talents would eventually stand out one day.</p>

  <p>The benefits of endless reincarnation were pretty obvious.</p>

  <p>But it was not easy to build a perfect world with endless reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Many powerful masters had tried and failed.</p>

  <p>And it hadn't been easy for Chiyou to have achieved this in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"So you mean to say that all the dead people in the divine land can retrieve their Memory Flames? And... The Nine Li race is no exception?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's body began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not know the tens of thousands of Nine Li people who had died, but they still belonged to the same race as him. If he could revive them...</p>

  <p>"Theoretically speaking, yes," No. 9527 answered. "But according to the soul of the hall, the key seems to be the 'Reincarnation Soul Weapon'.</p>

  <p>And you, who have an impure bloodline, cannot use the soul weapon."</p>

  <p>Pure bloodline!</p>

  <p>The only person Zheng knew who had pure Nine Li blood was his mother.</p>

  <p>If he retrieved the soul weapon and gave it to his mother, then they could revive all the Nine Li members!</p>

  <p>At this thought, Zheng became even more excited.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected a mere Stone Mouse to lead to so many things.</p>

  <p>Excited as he was, Zheng asked, "What kind of reincarnation rule does the Source World follow?"</p>

  <p>"The Source World?" No. 9527 smiled. "The rule the Source World follows is the same as that of the chaos. No one can break that cold rigid rule. When one's soul is destroyed, their memory will also disappear.</p>

  <p>And no one can be reincarnated in this truth. If one dies, then they die eternally!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded silently. He had finally begun to figure out the so-called reincarnation mystery.</p>

  <p>The reincarnation was not as complicated as Zheng had thought it to be.</p>

  <p>It was only that all the memories one had saved from birth till death would be copied by the divine land, which then became the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Once a living creature died, if the Memory Flame returned to the soul of a certain creature, it would be considered a successful case of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Chiyou had created a perfect Reincarnation Land, but it had not been used by the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Or it could also be that the Yellow Emperor Guards had launched an allout attack on the divine land before the Nine Li race could find this place, causing the Nine Li race to lose any chance of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>If one Nine Li member with a pure bloodline controlled the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, all the members of the Nine Li race could be reincarnated successfully.</p>

  <p>Zheng and No. 9527 were communicating with each other through their consciousness. The hall soul had been waiting for a long time by now.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to take the test, young man?" The voice of the hall soul sounded again. There was no trace of impatience in the voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. "Yes! Of course!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Follow me." The hall soul turned around and walked away.</p>

  <p>Its figure floated in the air like smoke.</p>

  <p>Zheng also floated up and followed closely behind the soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the hall soul passed the huge statues, and finally reached the end of the Reincarnation Hall.</p>

  <p id="top_25">There stood a grey wall, underneath which was a golden bronze door.</p>

  <p>The door opened automatically when Zheng walked towards it.</p>

  <p>"Get in, young man. And let me remind you. This is a cruel test and you may die as you undergo it. But according to the rules, I will give you a chance to be reincarnated," the hall soul said.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, smiling.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to be reincarnated, which meant that he would have to start everything all over again.</p>

  <p>According to No. 9527, the Memory Flame worked to record a creature's past in the divine land.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, the Memory Flame that belonged to him might only record his memories in the divine land, and every other memory he had in the universe would probably be wiped out.</p>

  <p>But no matter what would happen, he was determined to take the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped inside the golden bronze door without hesitation.</p>

  <p>It was dark inside.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Once the bronze door had closed behind him, a beam of light appeared in the distance, like dawn on the horizon, rising quickly.</p>

  <p>The entire place lit up in the blink of an eye, accompanied by a thunderous sound that shook the ground.</p>

  <p>"I had wanted to leave a wisp of soul in the divine land to protect my people, but the Yellow Emperor is skilled in tracing souls. It's easy for him to locate the divine land through my soul. So I gave up that idea. In this test, I will represent myself as a Magical Crow. So if you happen to chance upon a Magical Crow, know that it's me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked in the direction from which the voice had sounded, a strange expression taking its place on his face. The voice was coming from a crow with curly fur.</p>
