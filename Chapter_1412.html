</p>

  <p>The day Landry had comprehended thirty percent of the Gods-intimidating Strike was one to be remembered. The explosive power he had unleashed had also shaken many palace leaders who were also there.</p>

  <p>Those who were almost as powerful as world lords were not afraid of Landry's sword attack, but they still were quite jealous of him. To their dismay, they had just found out that even a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior like Landry with no great talent in himself was able to unleash such power.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's strike was an almost complete move of the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Although, in terms of pure swordsmanship, he did not dare to call himself a master, but he was still quite confident in himself. This was a sword skill created by a Supreme Lord and he did not have the qualifications to evaluate it too much.</p>

  <p>However, by relying on his own insights into the sword intent of Supreme Lord Sword, he was able to unleash almost ninety percent of the Gods-intimidating Strike's power... Such power was unbearable.</p>

  <p>To put matters into perspective, he simply could not release ninety percent of the power. If he were to do so, this entire supreme world would have been cut in half!</p>

  <p>As a response to his attack, a faint sword intent flew out at an extremely fast pace. At the beginning, it did not seem to be shocking at all. In fact, after the sword intent had entered the endless golden and silvery mountain, it disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was looking as calm as the eye of the storm, but there was a hint of confusion on his face. What was going on?</p>

  <p>His strike did not seem to be too powerful if evaluated purely in terms of power.</p>

  <p>Could it be that he hadn't completely comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike?</p>

  <p>He had of course not expected this sword strike to be able to shake the entire heavens and the earth, but since it had disappeared without a trace after entering the mountain, it had truly let him down. This was supposed to be a legendary sword skill that could wound a True God, but right now, Luo Luo Zheng could not see its effect at all.</p>

  <p>Was his understanding of the Gods-intimidating Strike not enough? Was he doing something wrong? Or did he really have to forget love and emotions in order to use the Gods-intimidating Strike?</p>

  <p>No matter how he thought about it, Luo Luo Zheng still couldn't figure out what he had done wrong and why his strike hadn't had any effect.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, his state of mind was truly unable to reach such a level as required by the laws!</p>

  <p>In the early days, he had once learned how to enter the state of forgetting oneself, but it was only a common technique to control one's state of mind.</p>

  <p>But to somehow entirely forget one's emotions, it was required to cultivate some entirely new cultivation method. However, Luo Luo Zheng was yet to find a method that guaranteed such a stoic state.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng did not realize was that he had completely underestimated the state of mind.</p>

  <p>Being able to forget his emotions just wasn't something that Luo Luo Zheng could grasp with his current cultivation base. Even a world lord would only be able to master one tiny bit of it.</p>

  <p>Why did Yolande cut off her own soul and transform it into a million clones?</p>

  <p>The answer lay in emotions. Through this method, the clones which had been created from split souls would have incomplete emotions. They would be reincarnated into the mortal world with incomplete emotions, and would only experience life and death. Then Yolande would collect those clones and comprehend the memories within them, essentially aggregating their knowledge into herself.</p>

  <p>So this method would help her to avoid having all kinds of emotions.</p>

  <p>This was related to the cultivation method she was going to practice in the future. Right now, in the eyes of the onlookers, she was just a lucky and powerful woman with the backing of a Supreme Lord. But just by relying on her understanding of this art, she would be able to walk on a path that was different from everyone else.</p>

  <p>So how was it going to be so easy for Luo Luo Zheng to comprehend the state of forgetting emotions?</p>

  <p>In any case, Luo Luo Zheng was not too disappointed. The power of the Gods-intimidating Strike was weaker than he had expected; but it did not mean that the method was useless. The most important thing was that this sword technique did not require any accumulation of power and momentum and could be unleashed instantly. Such a power was enough to resist an enemy's attack if he required a quick shield.</p>

  <p>After getting out of the Illusion Space, Luo Luo Zheng shot an indifferent glance at the words "Sword Practicing Hall" which were mounted above the enormous doorway, before quietly leaving the hall.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that the moment he left, a loud rumbling sound suddenly reverberated throughout the entire Illusion Space!</p>

  <p>This enormous golden and silvery mountain had been transformed from an eighth-grade divine texture and reinforced by sixty thousand auxiliary divine textures. It was modelled on the legendary Golden-silver Demon Mountain. Both its height and width were far beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>If he were to climb up as fast as he could from the foot of the mountain, he would probably have to climb for a year or so to reach the peak. If the mountain was placed horizontally on the ground and if a ground to hold it existed, it might take up several great worlds...</p>

  <p>Since the Illusion Space was extremely spacious and endless, such a huge mountain could easily be formed by the divine textures and placed there. When Luo Luo Zheng had entered this Illusion Space, he couldn't see the peak or the bottom of the mountain because of its unimaginable size.</p>

  <p>The rumbling sounds that had started after Luo Luo Zheng left continued for several hours.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Illusion Space around midnight, but the rumbling sounds had not stopped for a long time. They lasted all the way until the sun had risen in the morning.</p>
