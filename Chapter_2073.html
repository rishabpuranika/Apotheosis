<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tokens on the True Path were all given to Luo Zheng at random.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he still hadn't received the token he wanted.</p>

  <p>The valley token to open the pill refining room was entirely useless for Luo Zheng. He had no use for such a thing. Disappointment was apparent in Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He casually stuffed the valley token into his space ring and prepared himself to rush onto the True Path once more. Perseverance was seen in his expression as he didn't plan to give up until he got a heaven token.</p>

  <p>Saul, who stood at the side, stopped Luo Zheng. "Since you have obtained a valley token, I think you can have a look in the pill refining room. This pill refining room has been closed for many years. The first master of the fairy palace must have left behind quite a few good things in that place."</p>

  <p>The challenge on the True Path would grow even more difficult with every step. Saul was worried about Zheng's condition.</p>

  <p>After he heard Saul's advice, Luo Zheng pondered for a moment. Ultimately, he took Saul's suggestion to enter the pill refining room.</p>

  <p>Previously, when he opened the library or the weapon refining workshop, Luo Zheng had obtained a lot of treasures. The rare cultivation methods in the library and the unique materials in the weapon refining workshop of the fairy palace were the best among the various universes. Some of those rare treasures couldn't even be found in other universes. However, it was a pity that Luo Zheng could not make full use of them.</p>

  <p>If he could find some top quality pills in the pill refining room, it might bring him quite a bit of benefit. Such a discovery would definitely be advantageous for him.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng headed straight to the fairy palace's middle courtyard with the valley token in his hand. Soon, he stepped into the pavilion. His eyes were filled with expectations.</p>

  <p>The enormous pavilion had a total of six paths that headed towards different directions. The first path was the one where Luo Zheng entered the fairy palace through the front courtyard. The other five pathways led respectively to the library, weapon refining workshop, pill refining room, dungeon, and the training tower. The pavements towards each building were decorated with majestic flowers.</p>

  <p>After he passed through the pavilion, Luo Zheng arrived in front of the pill refining room.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other buildings in the fairy palace, the pill refining room was the smallest. It was a very regular structure, even similar to a shed. Nothing special could be seen in its outside appearance.</p>

  <p>For the pill refining rooms of many sects, people could smell the faint fragrance of medicine from far away. The aroma would fill the noses of any visitors, even as they approached the building. However, Luo Zheng was already at the door of the pill refining room in the fairy palace, yet he didn't smell anything…</p>

  <p>As he noticed the absence of smell, Luo Zheng did not hold much hope in the place. Perhaps the pill refining room only had some tools for refining pills.</p>

  <p>There were restrictions everywhere within the fairy palace. Holy Bromley had set up those robust restrictions. With formidable seals, the restrictions were made to be almost impenetrable. Even True Gods would find it hard to break them.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng took out the valley token, he poured a stream of chaotic energy into it. Immediately, a layer of faint luster appeared on the surface of the pill refining room. The luster gathered at the door and fluctuated before a sharp sound was heard. Suddenly, a small breeze of energy was felt. The restriction exerted at the entrance of the pill refining room was automatically removed.</p>

  <p>"Creak!"</p>

  <p>The door of the pill refining room, which had been sealed for countless years, opened from the middle. The hinges in the door screeched as the entrance widened.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the pill refining room was opened, a vibrant medicinal fragrance wafted out from within. The therapeutic aroma rushed straight into Zheng's nose. The moment he smelled it, he felt his entire body's blood energy surge and his body involuntarily tremble slightly…</p>

  <p>"What smell is this?" As he suddenly stood still, Luo Zheng lost the sensation and control over his legs. He thought there was poison in the medicinal fragrance and wanted to escape, but his own body refused to budge.</p>

  <p>There was a strong instinct within his body that caused him to inhale the medicinal scent involuntarily.</p>

  <p>The events were absolutely unbelievable. Zheng's physical body actually went against the will of his soul. It was as if he was hypnotized!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to breathe in the medicinal fragrance in massive quantities. As he continued to inhale the medicinal scent, the blood energy within his body began to churn even more violently…</p>

  <p>"Pop! Pop! Pop!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, the wounds on his body tore open one after another.</p>

  <p>Even the wounds inside his body began to open up. Horrible pain flowed to Zheng's extremities.</p>

  <p>Golden blood had started to bleed out from Zheng's wounds.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's fleshly body had been strengthened, his body had already become extremely tough. But the blood energy in his body was unable to keep up with the development of his body. Although there was help from the warm currents, his rejuvenation was not as fast as before. Something must have affected his regeneration.</p>

  <p>The dark golden blood was the blood clots that lingered in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Even if warm currents were to clear the blood clots, it would still take a considerably long time. The coagulation of the dark golden blood was the reason Luo Zheng was unable to recover completely.</p>

  <p>After the dark golden blood completely flowed out, Luo Zheng could feel a comfortable sensation throughout his body. The previously crazy and turbulent blood energy in his body also calmed down. Calmness and tranquility flowed inside him as if he was finally rejuvenated. Then, Luo Zheng slightly twisted his body, and all the wounds on his body closed up again. His regeneration had gotten faster at that time.</p>

  <p>"This is the fragrance of the Divine Blood Pill. The fragrance is very potent." Saul appeared behind Luo Zheng. He was only a puppet, so he naturally wouldn't be affected by the fragrance.</p>

  <p>"Divine Blood Pill! I see..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the front door of the pill refining room. A faint brown color continuously lingered around the room. The previous aroma made Luo Zheng wonder how strong the medicinal fragrance in the room would be.</p>
