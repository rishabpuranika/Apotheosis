<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tribulation was a calamity that fell from the heavens. The lightning dragon was the creature of the heavens and had no master.</p>

  <p>After comprehending the fourth layer of the Thunder Law, Luo Zheng began to refine the lightning dragon.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tribulation was both a test for warriors and also an opportunity to enhance themselves.</p>

  <p>Thus, from the Life and Death Realm onwards, warriors had to pass life and death crises one after another; a life and death crisis was equal to a life and death trial. It would allow one to become stronger.</p>

  <p>Multiple rays of lightning surged unceasingly in Zheng's eyes. After he absorbed the lightning dragon, the electric currents continued to ravage his body. Thanks to his control over the Law Power, he was able to digest the massive amount of lightning.</p>

  <p>"He actually consumed all of the Thunder Tribulation! What a freak!"</p>

  <p>"It's not like this has never happened before. When Lexer was making a breakthrough to the Soul Sea Realm, he had also absorbed the Thunder Tribulation."</p>

  <p>"It's not the same. When Lexer was making a breakthrough to the Soul Sea Realm, the Thunder Tribulation he faced was only at the second layer. This huge lightning dragon contains the fourth layer Thunder Law."</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were also whispering to each other. Their faces were full of envy. The Thunder Tribulation did not cause much harm to Luo Zheng; it actually strengthened him.</p>

  <p>"Humph! The Thunder Tribulation was just the first wave of attack, yet it was so terrifying. What kind of damned things are behind this?" War Emperor York asked irritably.</p>

  <p>The dark clouds in the sky began to dissipate layer by layer, and light shone down through the enormous empty space that was revealed in the sky. The thick clouds began to dissipate at a visible speed.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, the dark clouds that had formed over the entire continent completely disappeared, and brightness returned. Several Soul Sea Realm masters who had been fighting the tsunami also returned to the Feather Emperor Island.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, a golden ray of light shot out from the horizon.</p>

  <p>Within the ray of light were more than ten figures, led by a white-browed Taoist priest who was dressed in robes. He was the one hosting the competition by the side of the West Dragon River.</p>

  <p>He was a human warrior from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"Master Derek!" Turner greeted the priest respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Master Derek, are you here because of the Thunder Tribulation?" War King Wind asked as he flew up to greet the priest. The other Soul Sea Realm warriors also bowed at him respectfully.</p>

  <p>Derek descended on the pyramid with his followers and asked harshly,</p>

  <p>"Who is undergoing the tribulation? It actually has such great power!"</p>

  <p>The power of the Heavenly Tribulation caused by Luo Zheng was too astonishing. Derek thought that it was some powerful Soul Sea Realm master undergoing the tribulation, but even a powerful Soul Sea Realm master would find it difficult to trigger such a terrifying Thunder Tribulation. Therefore, Derek had come personally to the Feather Emperor Island to investigate.</p>

  <p>Hearing Derek's question, Turner cupped his hands and said, "Master Derek, Tianxing Luo, a divine-level talent of our Harlen Divine Kingdom, is undergoing the tribulation."</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo?" Derek was taken aback. He swept his gaze over the crowd and saw Luo Zheng sitting upright in a meditative pose not too far away. Wisps of smoke rose from the charred parts of his body. "He is merely a warrior at the middle stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm. How he is undergoing the tribulation? And how can he trigger such a powerful Thunder Tribulation?"</p>

  <p>Derek was utterly shocked!</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he didn't believe that Luo Zheng could make a breakthrough and reach the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in such a short time.</p>

  <p>After entering the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, warriors would sooner or later undergo the Heavenly Tribulations. Derek came from the Upper World, and to him and other warriors in the Upper World, even a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm was considered a newcomer to cultivation.</p>

  <p>So it was quite impressive that a mere Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior could actually instigate such a terrifying Small Heavenly Tribulation!</p>

  <p>The emperors had never seen such a terrifying small Heavenly Tribulation before. How could they answer Derek's question?</p>

  <p>Derek frowned, but he stayed there and observed Luo Zheng carefully.</p>

  <p>He had already noticed Luo Zheng earlier. Luo Zheng could catch the eye of the great human powers of the Upper World if they saw Zheng's performance in the previous battles.</p>

  <p>However, the human race occupied over ten thousand supreme worlds in the Upper World. Each supreme world had countless forces and even millions of sacred places. In Derek's opinion, a talent like Luo Zheng was insignificant in a supreme world, not to mention among the three great human forces in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Maybe a second-rate sacred place would regard him as one of the most important disciples.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Derek was unlike Immortal Mist. Immortal Mist had used the power of the Purple Star Grand Palace to deduce Zheng's fate. Derek, however, could not see Zheng's fate with his eyes alone.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's performance was outstanding and he could be considered invincible among the warriors of his level in the four divine kingdoms, in Derek's eyes, he was nothing at all.</p>

  <p>However, that was his earlier impression of Luo Zheng. Now, after seeing such a massive tribulation, he was stunned.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had made a breakthrough to the Life and Death Realm, the first wave of Small Heavenly Tribulation was already so terrifying.</p>

  <p>Where did this guy come from?</p>

  <p>This Heavenly Tribulation was not just limited to one wave. So Derek decided to observe the proceedings carefully. This Heavenly Tribulation was terrifying, so perhaps the Lotus Flower might bloom at the end of it.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see how many petals the Lotus Flower would release.</p>

  <p>Marine was standing behind Derek. When she found out that the previous Thunder Tribulation was triggered by Luo Zheng, she had mixed feelings. As the Holy Maiden of the secret sect, she was responsible for communicating with the Upper World. She knew more about the Upper World than the Soul Sea Realm warriors present. She didn't expect Luo Zheng to be the one who had gone through the tribulation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Luo Zheng was still absorbing the power of thunder and lightning within his body in the same spot. Pure power spread throughout his body, dividing and infusing every cell of his body, stimulating rapid growth within his body.</p>

  <p>Any Law Power was not used only to destroy. For instance, the Fire Law originally symbolized annihilation, but contained within it the power of rebirth.</p>

  <p>And the Thunder Law could bring about life amidst annihilation.</p>

  <p>According to a saying, "When the spring thunder strikes the earth, it can awaken all things that are hibernating and restore life to the natural world." This was the beginning of life.</p>

  <p>It was said that after one activated the Soul Sea and condensed his life vitality, he would need thunder in his belly constantly. The stimulation of the power of thunder would be able to give birth to life within his belly.</p>

  <p>This was the fourth layer of the Thunder Law: Creation.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng's body looked as if it had been reborn. The layer of carbonized skin on his body started to crack open, revealing the tender red flesh within. When the charred skin shed completely, his body looked like that of a newborn's.</p>

  <p>'Will there be a second wave of attack?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>After passing through the first wave of Heavenly Tribulation safely, Luo Zheng raised his head and looked skywards.</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors would only have to combat the first wave of Thunder Tribulation when they were making a breakthrough to the Life and Death Realm. But the more powerful one's talent was, the more waves of Heavenly Tribulation they would have to deal with and the more powerful they would become. Even divine-level talents would often face more than one wave of Heavenly Tribulation, so the chances of Luo Zheng facing more than one wave were very high.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, a faint golden shadow appeared in the sky. The golden light became more and more obvious and golden swords began to appear slowly one by one.</p>

  <p>"This is the Metal Tribulation! This Metal Tribulation appears after the Thunder Tribulation. In all likelihood, it will be even more difficult to deal with!" cried a Soul Sea Realm warrior, who had experienced the Metal Tribulation before.</p>

  <p>However, Derek had a look of disdain on his face. He looked down on all the Soul Sea Realm masters in the divine kingdoms for their lack of knowledge. "It's only a Metal Tribulation. What's so surprising about that?" he stated indifferently.</p>

  <p>For him, neither the Thunder Tribulation, Metal Tribulation, Wind Tribulation nor Water Tribulation held much weight. Only the Lotus Flower would be able to determine a warrior's true potential.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's Small Heavenly Tribulation was terrifying, he still hadn't given birth to the Lotus Flower. So his feat was not that impressive.</p>

  <p>Golden swords covered the sky, each of them sparkling with a dazzling light. A thousand swords. Ten thousand. A hundred thousand. A million...</p>

  <p>As the number of golden swords increased, they blotted out the sky and the sun. It looked just like one, giant golden cloud.</p>
