  <p>
</p>

  <p>The oldest man took Luo Zheng and quietly disappeared in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The Warden race had always been very mysterious. They had quietly visited this world. Only a few were aware of their existence, and even the exiles knew little about them.</p>

  <p>It was the reason that, as much as possible, they must be cautious and careful in leaving the place.</p>

  <p>The Torrent Bone Tower stood as the fourth rib of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>On the rib was a crack which was as long as tens of billions of miles.</p>

  <p>The crack had created a wide space inside the Torrent Bone Tower, and it was then known to be the most suitable bone tower.</p>

  <p>Torrent Bone Tower had been occupied by the strongest race in this world. The Snake Goddess race, widely known and considered as the strongest race, naturally took control of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the Torrent Bone Tower, there was the vast Immemorial Wildernesses.</p>

  <p>For commoners to enter this part of the Immemorial Wildernesses, it was necessary to acquire the Admission Tokens from the disciples of the nine great sects of the Snake Goddess race. It would deem impossible for them to enter this place without the Admission Tokens.</p>

  <p>No one had the guts and was brave enough to fight against the number one race in this world, which was the Snake Goddess race. Even joining the sects subordinate to the race was extremely difficult, let alone the main Snake Goddess race itself.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Snake Goddess race had attracted countless outstanding talents in this world.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>Inside the void, the ripples spread out in circles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already taken out of the space channel. In a short period of time, together with the oldest man, they had already traveled over 30 billion miles.</p>

  <p>He took a look at the Torrent Bone Tower in the distance. A strange expression appeared on his face as he muttered, "It seems that there is still a long distance from the Torrent Bone Tower."</p>

  <p>The Torrent Bone Tower looked close at hand. But the truth was, flying there would take so much time. It would take a longer time than expected.</p>

  <p>The oldest man's face revealed a bitter smile as he said, "The Snake Goddess race has made a lot of rules. They don't allow outsiders to enter their bone tower at will."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race made a rule forbidding the other exiles to come to their bone tower by travelling through the void.</p>

  <p>Their race was really the most powerful existence in this world so even the exiles had to obey their complicated rules.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and flew forward following the oldest man as they continued with their journey.</p>

  <p>He looked around and noticed that the divine land was high up in the sky.</p>

  <p>The divine land looked really huge. It was floating in the deep sky emitting a soft luster, like a piece of gem with a homogeneous structure.</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng, this was actually the first time for him to be this close to the divine land ever since he came to this world.</p>

  <p>At the center of the gem, there was a red band of light. The light appeared to be bounding the gem.</p>

  <p>The band of light was coming out from the top of the Torrent Bone Tower. Luo Zheng noticed that a large portion of it was hidden inside the bone tower. Through the huge crack in the middle, he could even faintly see that the chain seemed to be emitting a scarlet light.</p>

  <p>The Torrent Bone Tower was 700 to 800 billion miles high. The distance between the bone tower and the divine land was more than a trillion miles. The band of light that entangled around the divine land had an overall length of two to three trillion miles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know what method the Snake Goddess race had used to make such a long band of light.</p>

  <p>As he was caught on his own thought, a row of white dots suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>A group of Wild Gods in white armor flew over.</p>

  <p>It was not until those Wild Gods came in front of him that he noticed that their armor was made of bones.</p>

  <p>This world was so desolate that some necessities could only be made and crafted from inexhaustible bones.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the group of Wild Gods shouted at the oldest man and Luo Zheng, waving the bone spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>His tone had been very stern. He scrutinized the oldest man and eyed him up and down, and his expression had afterwards immediately turned solemn.</p>

  <p>The powerhouses like the oldest man gave people an insurmountable sense of vicissitudes just by standing there silently. This kind of feeling was from his cultivation level, and even the blind knew that he was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The Wild God spoke with great respect, "This city is under the rule of the Snake Goddess race. May I ask your purpose in coming? I can deliver the message on behalf of you."</p>

  <p>When the old man heard this, he only smiled faintly. "Don't bother. Or I will have to wait until very long. I can do it myself."</p>

  <p>The process of delivering a message would surely take some time. Any message or information needed to be passed through levels. The Wild Gods could only deliver the message to the nearest city, and then the city would inform the sect. The message would then be finally passed by the sect to the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>The oldest man placed his hands behind his back, and stared at the Torrent Bone Tower. His lips moved a little.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods didn't know who the oldest man was looking for. They stayed there and didn't dare to leave.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a rainbow like light spiraled and slowly appeared before him. In the circular rainbow, a figure emerged.</p>

  <p>The rainbow like light was eventually blocking against the figure that only a silhouette could be seen, but it was clear that this person had a nice figure.</p>

  <p>"Timotheus Jin, you never left the bone tower for so many years. What's the matter today? Why are you here?"</p>

  <p>A soft voice was heard from the silhouette.</p>

  <p>The voice pricked into Luo Zheng's ears, as if some sweet water was pouring into his ears, melting his soul.</p>

  <p>"I come for something very important," Timotheus flatly answered.</p>

  <p>'So the old man's name is Timotheus Jin, ' Luo Zheng thought in his heart.</p>

  <p>"This world remains the same day after day and year after year. What else is so important apart from the odd bones? I guess that you have found a young guy with a good talent. So you want to marry him into our Snake Goddess race, right?"</p>

  <p>A tinge of sadness could be felt coming from the sweet and soft voice.</p>

  <p>The woman probably noticed Luo Zheng behind Timotheus, so she played a joke.</p>

  <p>The exiles who were qualified to be imprisoned in this place weren't just nobody in the Source World, so they felt quite helpless to fall into such a position.</p>

  <p>"Maybe such boring days will be gone forever." Timotheus smiled.</p>

  <p>The woman in the rainbow was very smart. She knew what Timotheus meant. However, she did not have much interest in it. She just lazily said,</p>

  <p>"We have tried so many methods before. But have we ever succeeded?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus kept his calm and spoke in a light tone, "If there is a slight possibility, are you willing to give up?"</p>

  <p>The woman in the rainbow was silent for a moment before saying, "No!"</p>

  <p>"That's right!" Timotheus laughed. "Let us go in!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, the colorful vortex continued to spin. Timotheus and Luo Zheng entered it.</p>

  <p>As for the Wild Gods who had stopped Timotheus and Luo Zheng just now, they were in a daze witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" One of the Wild Gods broke from his trance, patted the shoulder of their leader and cried out, "They have left!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the Wild Gods then came back to his senses. He didn't know who that woman or Timotheus was, but no matter what the reason Timotheus came to the Snake Goddess race was, he couldn't have a hand in it.</p>

  <p>He just shrugged his shoulders and led his men to leave in a hurry.</p>
