  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a lavish spread for them, including all types of luscious fruits, juicy meat and different varieties of fragrant wines. As he savored them, Luo Luo Zheng realized that this Skyland race really knew how to enjoy themselves.</p>

  <p>These varied spread of delicacies could be credited to the women from the Skyland race who were extremely good at visualizing food. Their creativity with visualization had even surpassed Luo Zheng's imagination. He was amazed at their ability to combine taste and life vitality so perfectly.</p>

  <p>All the warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race as well as from other races were also enjoying themselves; savoring each delicacy with delight.</p>

  <p>If they finished the food on the plate, those girls would come back and close their eyes to meditate. They would transform life vitality into food, and it would be different delicacies every single time.</p>

  <p>After their special meal, the Skyland race made arrangements for everyone to stay.</p>

  <p>They decided that they would stay in the territory of the Skyland race for a few more days, until the Harmony race arrived. After that they would proceed with action.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stayed in one of the pagodas and during the whole night of meditation, observed the development of his inner world.</p>

  <p>Over the past two days, Luo Luo Zheng had frequently used the power of the Nine Divine Stars. But of late those stars seemed to have dimmed a little.</p>

  <p>However, as the chaotic sea surged, some traces of the chaotic energy were absorbed by the nine stars.</p>

  <p>Chaos could transform into all things. Everything within the divine land evolved from chaos, including life vitality.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings cultivated life vitality and turned it into the universe, hence everything in the universe evolved from life vitality. Therefore, it was expected for the nine stars to absorb chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>So wasn't it likely that the creatures evolved from chaotic energy would be at a higher level than him?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was born in the universe, so considering this, he was formed from life vitality. He could be considered a 'secondary creature', while the creatures in his inner world were actually of a higher level.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but smile at that thought.</p>

  <p>After eighteen hours, the night in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land ended and the daytime came.</p>

  <p>On a tall tower several tens of feet away from Luo Luo Zheng, a graceful figure flashed across. As her toes touched the ground and a faint smile blossomed, Luo Luo Zheng realized the woman was Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Come, I want to take you to a place." Han Liusu smiled and leaning across, she pulled Luo Luo Zheng up.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"You will see. It is an interesting place!"</p>

  <p>As she said this, Han Liusu whirled around and jumped far away from the towers.</p>

  <p>Curiosity got the better of Luo Luo Zheng and he immediately followed after Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>It was baffling to see the large numbers of pagodas in the Skyland race territory. Their size became smaller as they moved ahead. The ones in front of them was so small that they looked like stones protruding from the black water surface.</p>

  <p>These pagodas in the distance seemed like a path, extending along the black water.</p>

  <p>Even though they could fly in this place, he followed Han Liusu who was leading the way. He couldn't figure out where this woman was taking him to.</p>

  <p>But when they were walking along a row of short stone piers, a member of the Skyland race blocked their way. "Behind us is the Tidal Surge!"</p>

  <p>"This is the trial ground of our Skyland race. One can enter only with a trial tally."</p>

  <p>Although each sacred place for cultivation had its own cultivation method, they all had to pay the trial tally to access. And the Skyland race was no exception.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng get a trial tally?</p>

  <p>However, this did not seem to be a problem for Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Their Han clan had a large city exclusive to them in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The purple trial tally could be precious, and it was not that easy for the other Han Clan members to obtain. But for a person like Han Liusu or Pascal, it was very easy.</p>

  <p>The corners of Liusu's mouth curved up slightly. With a casual flick of her hand, two purple trial tallies shot towards the guard of Skyland race.</p>

  <p>After a close examination of the two trial tallies, the guard allowed them to pass.</p>

  <p>As he continued to walk forward, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that the black water beneath his feet started to surge, rolling forward in waves.</p>

  <p>At the same time, wide platforms appeared before them. It was as though giant mushrooms had sprung up on top of the black water.</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand warriors on these platforms.</p>

  <p>The majority of them were warriors from other races and the remaining few were from the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>This was something Luo Luo Zheng could deduce.</p>

  <p>When a warrior cultivated, they would rarely choose to improve themselves through the body refinement. The vast majority of them cultivated life vitality!</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors that entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land would first look to enter the Skyland race's cultivation sacred place.</p>

  <p>Once they obtained the purple trial tally, they would enter this place at the first possible moment.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had been teleported to a normal place and obtained the purple trial tally, he probably wouldn't have chosen the Skyland race. After all, there was no need for him to cultivate life vitality.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu entered, the warriors from the other races on the platforms glanced at them. When they looked at Luo Luo Zheng, they were expressionless, but when they saw Han Liusu, some of them frowned and revealed a trace of fear.</p>

  <p>They were relieved when Han Liusu did not go up the platforms.</p>

  <p>"What are we doing here?" Luo Luo Zheng looked confused.</p>

  <p>"Just come with me," Han Liusu said with a laugh. "But there's one thing I need your help with."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Help me beat up someone!" Han Liusu said.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Luo Zheng firmly refused. The woman had indeed helped him before, but Luo Luo Zheng had only agreed to help her enter the Soul Suppressing Cliff. That was called for. And Luo Luo Zheng had also saved her in the forest of giant trees.</p>
