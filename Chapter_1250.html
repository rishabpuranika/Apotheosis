  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mu Ning contentedly leaned into Luo Zheng's embrace in joyful bliss. Right now, all that mattered was him and his comforting presence. Their surroundings and the current context of the situation did not matter so long as he was here.</p>

  <p>The young woman's obvious smile was like a thorn that pierced through Yudie's heart.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The loud, clanging sound reverberated in her ears as the ice halberd fell from her grasp and shattered into a thousand crystal pieces of life vitality that dissipated and returned to the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>"Master, I want to go back," Ning Yudie murmured, turning away from the offending scene in front of her. Her back was straight and her gait was elegant, like an ice phoenix that flew back towards the Cloud Hall, heartbroken, but dignified. Luo Luo Zheng, however, could tell that she was hurt.</p>

  <p>"Tia!"</p>

  <p>"Tia!" both Luo Luo Zheng and Imogen shouted at the same time.</p>

  <p>The elder cast a burning glare at Luo Luo Zheng before quickly following behind a sulking Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>A few elders remained despite Yudie's and Imogen's departure. One of them was Saint Morphens, who smiled bitterly at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young man had risen in leaps and bounds when it came to cultivation, and his extraordinary luck helped him survive multiple near-death experiences, but the same could not be said for his love life.</p>

  <p>It was normal for warriors to have multiple women. War kings and war emperors from the Divine Kingdom Continent even had thousands. An ordinary Illuminating Soul Realm warrior in the Central Region would normally have a group of women that he would regularly indulge in sexual relationships with.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie was different. Saint Morphens feared that she was someone who would never concede to such an arrangement. Moreover, Imogen was fiercely protective of Ning Yudie and would not just stand by while Luo Luo Zheng had another woman with him. Saint Morphens could only hope that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to solve this matter on his own.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to follow Ning Yudie, but Mu Ning was already curled up in his arms like a sheep. She was obviously very emotionally overwhelmed, and he had no idea how to deal with it.</p>

  <p>This wasn't his line of expertise. He was a hardened warrior who only knew the ways of battle and the path of cultivation. He had no experiences whatsoever when it came to love and emotions.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie was already inside her Ice Palace where icy mist had already filled the place.</p>

  <p>A lifelike ice phoenix flew slowly around her. Although this ice phoenix was a creature produced by visualization, it had gained some semblance of intelligence for having existed by Yudie's side for so long.</p>

  <p>It could feel Yudie's sadness, which also made it sad in return.</p>

  <p>The ice phoenix let out a soft, melancholic cry as it nipped Yudie's hair softly.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie couldn't help but smile when she realized how the ice phoenix was trying to comfort her. She reached out and gently stroked its head but the loneliness remained in her heart.</p>

  <p>There was also that frustration present, that lingering feeling of stubbornness she couldn't erase. She didn't know why or where it came from. Was it maybe because she instinctively hated Mu Ning? Or was it because she hated Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>

  <p>The icy mist parted and revealed Imogen smiling gently at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Master," Ning Yudie called out, forcing a smile on her face at the presence of her master.</p>

  <p>Imogen sighed. "Don't force yourself to smile when you're sad," she told her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sad," Ning Yudie said, shaking her head in denial.</p>

  <p>"Silly girl. How can I not understand your thoughts?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was by no means inferior to Imogen in terms of cultivation attainments. Even her talent was an outstanding existence compared to the divine-level talents in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>However, she was also still young and she could never compare to the amount of worldly wisdom Imogen held for having lived so many years.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie couldn't help but pout with how easily Imogen saw through her.</p>

  <p>Sighing, her master sat down next to her. "No matter how you look at it, Luo Luo Zheng is the perfect husband. Warriors' lifespan is so long that it's normal for them to have several women."</p>

  <p>Imogen had previously stood so fiercely on Yudie's side, but here she was, trying to convince her otherwise.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie reached out her finger and formed a six-sided snowflake in the midst of the mist. "If he is the perfect husband, won't that mean that all women in the world would want to marry him?" she complained.</p>

  <p>A snowflake was normally only the size of a needlepoint, and it required a great deal of vision to distinguish its shape. But the one on Yudie's hand continued to extend and expand until it reached the size of her palm.</p>

  <p>"All women in the world want to marry him?" Imogen repeated with a smile. "That brat might not be able to take it, but you're half-right. No matter what, you are truly being too stubborn. In my opinion, Mu Ning is much smarter than you."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips at her master's words. "She's smarter than me?</p>

  <p>Bah!" She wasn't very sure if she was more talented than the warriors from the four divine kingdoms, but she was pretty sure she was the best among all Central Region warriors in terms of talent. She was quite conceited in that regard.</p>

  <p>The fact was that Yudie's talent would place her as an outstanding warrior in the entire great world. If all female warriors of the three continents were gathered and ranked together, she would be on par with Fiona of the Wind Divine Kingdom and possibly just a slight bit inferior to Amber of the Demon Night. It was only because she had yet to enter the Tower of Crystal to determine the stage her talent belonged to that she couldn't be too sure.</p>

  <p>Imogen quickly corrected herself saying, "I meant in terms of EQ, you're still a child in this aspect. And Luo Luo Zheng is too!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Imogen could see what Saint Morphens could see. It was just that she didn't want to lose face and her prestige in front of Xander earlier. The only reason why there was a dispute was that Imogen was fiercely determined to protect Ning Yudie, but she clearly understood what these youngsters were thinking.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng also had a higher EQ, this issue would've been quickly solved by him. He only had two women, yet he wasn't able to deal with them.</p>

  <p>People with a higher EQ had multiple women who all got along well with each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just turned twenty while Ning Yudie was only a few years older.</p>

  <p>They were both still too young and had hundreds, even thousands of years left to live. They were still naive children who still had no idea how love and relationships worked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, had displayed an extremely higher EQ.</p>

  <p>She was incredibly stupid in the beginning, but was able to quickly restrain all her pettiness and turned into an extremely obedient wife in front of Luo Luo Zheng. She treated him as the absolute center of her world and would rather die than not stay by his side.</p>

  <p>Men absolutely adored this kind of woman.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie thought about this for a while. Silence and the mysterious mist surrounded both master and pupil before Yudie's eyes finally brightened in realization. "I can't do it now," she said.</p>

  <p>Imogen, however, heaved a sigh of relief. Being unable to do it now did not mean that she would not be able to do it in the future. It seemed her pupil had thought things through.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a quiet place in Cloudy City, both Xander and Luo Luo Zheng found a chance to catch up and talk. Xander immediately expressed his gratitude towards Luo Luo Zheng in helping rebuild the Ethereal Spirit Sect. If it weren't for him, the Heavenly Evil Sect would've still used their base as headquarters and they would've been completely erased from history.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng talked with Xander, his mind couldn't help but wander towards Ning Yudie. Although she betrayed no expression on her fair face earlier, her figure that slowly floated away made his heart ache.</p>

  <p>Xander was a clever man. The reason he stood up for Mu Ning before was because she had no one else to rely on. But with Luo Luo Zheng here, it would now be improper for him to get involved. Besides, Mu Ning had the upper hand in this. Luo Luo Zheng also carried a lot of responsibility when it came to this issue.</p>

  <p>After their chat, Xander got up and left with Brent. Before leaving, Brent's face was full of smiles and he kept asking Luo Luo Zheng when he'd marry his sister.</p>

  <p>Once the people from the Ethereal Spirit Sect left, Xi Youqin's smile disappeared and a serious expression fell on her face. "I think you should go to the Cloud Hall," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Why should I? I'm not going," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on her face. "Are you really not going?"</p>
